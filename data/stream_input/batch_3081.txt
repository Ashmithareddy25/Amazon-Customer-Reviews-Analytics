B007IXWKUK|5.0|It had a good flow. It was a easy read. I hated to see it end. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Another stand-out album by Katy Perry! All three of her albums are worth purchasing. My personal favorite tracks are:<br />Ghost<br />Double Rainbow<br />Choose Your Battles<br />Dark Horse<br />Roar
1938469011|5.0|Actually it was a gift from my daughter to her boyfriend.  He brews beer.  He really seems to like it a lot.
B00377V6J2|5.0|A great colaboration with Stevie Vaughn and Albert King. Good music, great riffs and fine songs! Great looper for the home or on the go!
B0033H7VI6|4.0|It is heavy but definitely up to the tasks that it is designed for. Also, it holds a good edge.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|The best thing if you have lived this evolution and you have been part of it. Written just as it was!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I was very happy with this conclusion to the series.  Not that I didn't have a few moments of fear that this series would end up ruined for me....much the way Allegiant (Divergent) ended up for me.  But have no fear, because our author comes through and at the same time redeems a character that I thought there was no hope for.  Now I just hope there's another book or two for him....someone is still on the loose and I think it would be great to see that story through the eyes of the one who's left!  And hey, maybe even peek in on Alex and Aidan.  A great read for those who have followed the series.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I like the app but I want to use certain songs without have to use the 60 version or pay to have no more ads other than that your app is perfect
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|lovable awesome if u can't beat this game u need help it's like rice and vinger get some to easy
B00G32OER4|5.0|Super scary!!! Best horror movie that has come out in a long time. Must see during the Halloween season! Fantastic!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It doesn't teach how to play the piano. But it's a great app for children. My nephew loves playing with it. Plus it plays songs for you and shows which keys to press to play the song yourself. You even get to change instruments.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been hearing so much about this game but didn't want to try it and become addicted like everyone else. Lol  I saw it was on kindle fire so I downloaded it. Yes it is addicting ......so simple but fun. Thanks!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I recommend this book! It's funny and poignant (sometimes simultaneously). The art is fun and the dogs are the best.
B00DOPEGAS|2.0|This loom does not compare to the &#34;rainbow loom&#34;.  The rubber bands slide off the loom very easily and all of the learning vidoes are with the rainbow loom and this one is not compatible because it is longer. I do not recommend buying this one.
B00EV6T6DQ|5.0|One of the most romantic and sadistic love story I've ever read. The graphic is awesome, full of cinematic potential. I'm dying to watch the movie.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I still have tears on my cheeks from this book, I feel good about the end. I like that.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Good graphics and still fun gameplay. I love the equipment that the pigs and birds have. It makes the game feel more refresh. Other than that and the nice music score, it's the same old am very bird game
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am loving Evermore! I have it on every computer &amp; device I own &amp; use it daily. I use it for fun- take pica or kids notes, for work- communicating with my VA, and colleagues, for getting rid of paper- I scan things &amp; sort them in Evermore so I can see them from any device. Its fantastic!!
B007HVBW2A|5.0|The Exorcist - still the classic, all time, best-ever, dramatic horror/ghost film ever.  Classic confrontation of good versus evil.  Father Damian Karras is outstanding in his performance.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film - see it.  You will not be disappointed.  It is a classic.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I like the story it really helped to understand where Kirk and his crewmates came from. It was also exciting!  Be warned though I consider myself a Trekky light, so if you don't like Star Trek this might not be the film for you.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I enjoyed this dystopian book and the idea, but if it was written in a more adult way, I would have enjoyed it more. In this book, Cassia goes out to find Ky. She doesn't give up when going through cannons and deserts to find her lover. I think the idea is good, but I wished she wasn't removed from the city she lived in. Now she's all over the place trying to find him and in my opinion, I wished the story took place inside the city. Overall, this book was interesting enough to keep me interested but not as much as I hoped.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Hilarious with some serious bits that sneak in and stick with you. I have not read any of Allie Brosh's writing before but I will be catching up on her blog now.
0345525558|2.0|I agree with most of the one star ratings, but it isn't quite that bad, and I actually did like the protagonist, Victoria, whom the one-star reviewers mostly loathed.  The flower deal was overdone, but I gave that a pass because the Victorians were infamous for overdoing so that seemed part of the theme.  It was all of the implausibilities that irked me.  To list them all is to spoil the surprises in the plot, the only reason to read this book.  The plot is rather intriguing, though contrived.  You get the feeling that when the even the author started to disbelieve her own story, she just went back and wrote in something to provide an explanation. But the &#34;explanations&#34; are never sufficient to satisfy.  OK, I can't resist pointing out the biggest &#34;no way&#34; - two nineteen-year-olds who are clearly in love live together for months and don't have sex because one &#34;doesn't like being touched&#34;?  Gimme a break.  Hormones are timeless cure for that.  I may have liked this book better if I had just picked it up on my own and read it for the suspenseful romance novel that it is, but it was chosen by my book club that generally recommends more erudite stuff.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Solid homage to the original story with a nice twist or three.  The art direction was very good.  The graphics were top notch and Ryan Reynolds made a good Hal Jordan.  I'm really hoping for a sequel.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Much better than what came with my Kindle Fire HD, but all of Yahoo's recent changes have been a disaster for a bunch of folks as what the reviews and comments have been....this shows up in there software app
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I hate it because I find it soo frustrating and because my son has become so addicted he tells me &#34;Don't turn it off. It's my life Mom.&#34;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This my favorite book so far! I couldn't stop reading until I finished the book.  It is very original since you would never suspect who the narrator of this book is.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Great album. The album has a nice mix of ballads and rock. This is my first Halestorm album and I highly recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|I have heard so much about this hot set of books, lol.. I ordered this used set, because they were at a good price. The set arrived in great condition and the series is so interesting that I cannot wait for the movie!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just got my kindle, after seeing videos of it I downloaded it first. Hands down a great way to start my first tablet.
B000JML90Y|5.0|Great book well written and thought out.  Definitely gets the imagination going in terms of evolution and &#34;survival of the fittest&#34; ideology.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Don't play this on a crowded bus! This game will keep your tablet moving as you try to get the guy out of the temple all while avoiding cliffs, roots, and of course a herd of angry apes. Everyone in the house loves playing the game.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I bought a similar apps hoping they would do all the things this app does, I even tried to install instagram and became very frustrated with all the other files and programs I needed to add to my kindle to make it work.<br /><br />The filters aren't many but they are pretty.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|&#34;Your parents have perished in a terrible fire.&#34; What would you be thinking if you were told that awful sentence while strolling around a beach? Shocked? Confused? Unbelieving? That's exactly how the Baudelaire children became the Baudelaire orphans. Violet, a very skilled inventor, Klaus, a reader, and Sunny, an infant, go through a very bad beginning that leads to a Series of Unfortunate Events. When placed in the care of an actor named Olaf, they realize first impressions are important. When one gives small children a long list of chores to do with no equipment or tools, provides one lumpy, small, uncomfortable bed for three people, then demands them to make dinner for ten people in a short amount of time, you realize how awful this man was. But it gets worse. And worse. And worse. Lemony Snicket's best book by far, for children 10 and up.<br />By Naree Asherian, 12
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I really LOVE the 2013 movie, and my nephew is playing in a high school students' production of the Broadway musical.  The book is very dark and meanders off on side topics, like the Napoleonic Wars, and the lot of French street urchins, for as much as 20 chapters each.  The movie focuses on the potential for people to be redeemed when you least expected it, and on the transcendence of the human spirit.  The book focuses on the theme of being a prisoner of your own mind.  I didn't even read the last chapters; it strongly looked as though in the book the protagonist ends by killing himself.  I put it in the book to take back to the half price bookstore to sell; I'd hardly recommend that my 13 year old nephew read it!  It's one of those very dark 19th century novels I'd really not recommend to anybody.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Being an old fart I can remember the Nike installation near my Grandparent's farm near Alvarado TX in the late '40s, early 50s.  Troops manning the sites ere known as &#34;the Nike Boys.&#34;  I lived 48 miles away in Dallas at the time.<br /><br />Considering all the travails cited in this most informative book I am glad that I neither lived close to any of the larger sites or air force bases or, for that matter even knew of them.  I'd have been fearful for sure.<br /><br />I also remember a later time, having just moved to Munich in 1957 during the height of the cold war having dreams of ducking and covering fro  nuclear blasts.  Don S.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Very cool game but not as addictive as candy crush!  I also let my kids enjoy as it does teach basic scientific principles.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Sometimes it is very frustrating and they should give more free boosters to help you.  I do like the game and I like playing and comparing with family and friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got app by mistake but I am pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  it becomes  a challenge as you progress and I recommend it for anybody to get mentally stimulated.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I normally don't care for books not based in the US but this one was great. Even had several messages at the end and things to ponder. Great book for a book club as it would have many things in it to discuss and have several points of view. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Think Harry Potter, in the future with a touch of Hunger Games. Really good book. Looking forward to the movie.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|After watching an episode, I can't wait for the next one.  I usually watch 2 or 3 at a time.  Love this show!
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie is a kitschy Halloween classic. Lots of sight gags, lots of schtick, and humor for both adults and children.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Thought this would be too juvenile but my niece s and nephews are better at it than I am!!  Challenging and fun!  I love the vampire premise too!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is truly awe inspiring, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and always has you wondering what will happen next. I would highly recommend this book and can not wait to read the second book in the series
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Still enjoyable but not as good as Monsters Inc.  Rented this to watch with my Grandaughter because she liked Monsters inc
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|It is about a spinster who manages moss colonies with tweezers. Yes, it's that boring! What a disappointment from a great author
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game finally came out for kindle fire! I have to say, all you really need to do is have friends send you lives. its not a bad game at all, and if you don't like waiting, delete it! its not that hard.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I already had ALL the seasons to Gilmore Girls, but I let one of my friends borrow a season and ONE disc was ruined, not her fault it was a freak accident. So, I ordered this. The discs were in PERFECT condition, I was so excited and pleased that I actually just replaced the entire season with the one I ordered. Very happy.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|plays it non stop every day. he can play it easily and its not to complicated for him..  hes 2 1/2 yrs goin on 16...  lol
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love it! Such a creative concept. They have created a dark and scary and not so distant future. Hope it works out.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great fun movie for adults and kids.  Enough adult humor in this that I could watch why my grandaughter enjoyed the other characters.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|If you read the first two books then I'm sure you feel like you have to read this one too, that's what happened to me.  I felt like the 2nd book was reaching a bit, but Allegiant was a challenge to even read.  I had to force myself to finish it.  It read like a very long story that was being squeezed into a short book, it wasn't good to say the least. The ending was also a huge disappointment, all in all I wish I would have saved my money.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|temple rum 2is a pretty good game but there J's one big flaw that makes it just ok. it is very laggy when you do not have Internet and sometimes when you do have internet
0062202081|5.0|I wish JB were as good as this book.  My daughter loves it and it was a great present.  She loves it!
006202406X|2.0|The characters didn't remain true to themselves, the plot devices were poorly thought out and there was so much more room for development. While the US has these issues, where is the rest of the world or example? Disappointing, so much scope for advancement, it seems a shame it was ended in such a rushed way.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I highly recommend this book- I connected with the main characters in a way I haven't in a long time while reading a book.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I first read Brandon Sanderson while finishing up the Robert Jordan &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; series.  I thought he did a respectable job of finishing what was becoming a very long piece of work.<br /><br />Next I read his Mistborne trillogy and found the world he created to be something to get lost in and different enough in creating newly interesting fantisy species.  I enjoyed Sherry Teppler's writing and have been looking for something akin to her ability to create characters with different attributes.<br /><br />I have almost finished The Way of Kings and believe i may have found my next series to follow.  The story is solid, Characters interesting, and the world different enough to provide for a true escapist fantasy / sci-fi experience.
B00ADS98FC|1.0|Amazon is scamming all of its customers.  I purchased this video from their site, but NOWHERE did it say that I could only watch it streaming.  When you opt to download a movie that you purchase, you should be able to download it.  I purchased this to be able to watch whenever I want, but instead I can only view it with an online connection!  I could have bought the dvd (elsewhere) instead if I knew Amazon was scamming me!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|This is an adictive game.  You can have success without buying upgrades. It just takes longer. I would recommend this game to anyone that liked games like warcraft or starcraft.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Love all the great ones on these CDs!  I was glad to get this on amazon after seeing in big box store for double the price
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love being able to play this game on my Kindle. Totally addictive and very challenging. I have to play it everyday.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Great DVD quality blu Ray DVD and cd<br />Combines all Las Vegas best shows that you can't get anywhere else to view at home!
B00CPLGFII|5.0|Motherboard died on my home built office quiet PC.  Was running unlocked quad AMD X-555 with 65 watt to keep low need for cooling and power.  Wanted to replace with another 65W processor with some more horsepower.  This is a great processor for basic gaming and home office productivity.  Also run CAD and architectural design software with this and performs extreemly well for fast rendoring.<br /><br />I normally build a new machine about every 2 years and have stayed with AMD for the past 10 years on home builds.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I put this in my Fire HD kinda as a second thought.  I found it's real handy to just click on this when I'm doing anything that needs a quick check on my math.
B00915G6R6|4.0|I enjoy the Good Wife greatly (didn't think I would).  I have to agree with other reviewers that the introduction in this season of Kalinda's abusive husband (Nick) flawed an otherwise excellent season.<br /><br />Also, for those like me who have poor hearing, this season does have SDH subtitles.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book!  Didn't want to put it down from beginning to end!  I definitely recommend reading it if you like historical fiction.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The writing is wonderful...and you can't beat the combination of Cumberbatch and Freeman. The two actors play off each other so well.  I am eagerly awaiting the next season.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I reread the first two books before reading this one. That was helpful, especially seeing so many negative reviews. Apart from the unexpected ending, it seems pretty consistent with the others. That is, choppy writing style, slow character development, plot and plot holes - but also original ideas. I say, well done Veronica Roth for your originality, I for one will look forward to your next lot of books.
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|Maybe 4 and a half. It is a good read. Lots of adventure and you can identify with the characters. At the end of each book you want to read another.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this Bag!  Perfect size to fit my Canon Rebel camera gear.  Well build, plenty of storage, Comfortable to wear or carry and a super price compared to many of the other bags out there.  All of my accessories stay put nicely in the bag held snuggly by velcro braces.  Highly recommend this bag!
0062255657|2.0|I found that Gaiman, as an author, was struggling to retell a story that he has told his audience many times over. Similar characters, and similar plot line.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I bought this and the soundtrack for my girlfriend for her birthday. She watches the movie 3 times a week minimum. From a guy who was expecting the worst, at least Elizabeth Banks is pretty and Adam from Workaholics is in it! Also they do some classic rock songs... It was not as bad as I was expecting and it makes the girlfriend happy! Both products shipped very fast!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This has turned out to be my go-to note taker.  I use it for everything from to-do lists to shopping lists.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|My son and I enjoyed this.  Well made movie, good acting, good story, good graphics, enough suspense to make you think a bit.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Just the special effects alone are what make this a must.  They used a new filming technique to shoot this movie. The movie and acting is done very well. Very good movie.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|From the first track (Ava Maria) throughout this CD - this trio of talented young men have wowed me once again. This album will be a staple in my holiday rotation for many years to come. It does not matter if they are singing in Latin, Italian, or English - their voices bring a fresh sound to classic and traditional sounds. Few talents are discovered these days like Il Volo - I see them having a very long career.
B00004W221|5.0|One of the BEST movies of all time! A true underdog story which constantly reminds you to never give up and keep chasing your dreams no matter what the odds are! I shed a tear every time I watch this movie!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. She loves the movie and seems to like the Soundtrack as well.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|It's a good calculator but I don't much like the ads and such because I find it detracts from the overall experience.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I had not originally been interested in this show when it came out several years ago. But after watching the first episode I was very intrigued. The characters made me want to know more about them. I love that each episode is unique in the courtroom, but carries other storylines through each episode. Hate to admit it, but I am kinda hooked. I am currently watching season 3 and it has kept my rapt attention.
B005HSL626|5.0|It's a simple game of slicing fruit, but it's very fun. It's also nice that there things to unlock, and starfruit to collect.
B000YDE4MS|4.0|Very Comfortable. No break-in time required.  Looks great with jeans.  Would purchase again.  Shipped and arribed on-time.  I would recommemd for casual wear only.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|If you go into this album expecting anything along the lines of \\"The Suburbs\\", \\"Neon Bible\\", or \\"Funeral\\", you will be very disappointed. With \\"Reflektor\\", the listener experiences Arcade Fire trying on some new musical styles and execution the likes of which I've certainly never heard before. This album is truly an epic, clocking in at 85 minutes over the span of 2 discs. Each disc has its own personality, and each song serves a purpose. Disc 1 is more danceable and rock-oriented, while Disc 2 is solemn and reflective, sort of like the way \\"Remain in Light\\" starts out a rocker with the first 5 songs and then slows down with the last 3. Not that I'm comparing \\"Reflektor\\" to \\"Remain in Light\\". The two are like night and day.<br /><br />But the bottom line is, Arcade Fire is trying something new here, and to me, it works extremely well. In the end, it may be a tad bit sloppy, but what album isn't? The 2 discs, different as they are from each other, still make up what I consider to be Arcade Fire's best album yet. \\"The Suburbs\\" and \\"Funeral\\" will always have a special place in my heart, but \\"Reflektor\\" is definitely their crowning achievement, so much so that if you're a new listener, you could pick this one up and love AF the same as if you started listening to them back when \\"Funeral\\" came out. (I'm one of the latter listeners, and I've stuck with AF all the way.) Bands need to evolve and try new things. Arcade Fire is one of today's best bands, and their skill, creativity, and musicianship is well displayed on this album.<br /><br />So don't even bat an eyelash at the other reviews claiming they sound too much like Talking Heads on this effort. They don't. They sound like Arcade Fire, and they will always sound like Arcade Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE KINDLE VERSION OF CANDY CRUSH IT MAKES THE THE WAIT EASIER WHEN TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES.ITS ALSO VERY RELAXING.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Good calculator, I have it on my IPAD and my android phone ... makes it easy to go from one to the other.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|HAD GOOD ACTION. JEFF WAS GREAT. THE STORY WAS A LITTLE SLOW. UNTIL NEAR THE END. THEN IT GOT A LITTLE BETTER. ALL IN ALL, NOT TO BAD OF A MOVIE.
B00E10X7A0|5.0|It was for FUN!  Cute movie that I'd watch again and again for FUN not to even try and compare it with the real original movie.  The making of this movie is magic in and of itself alone.  Great acting for all involved.  Extremely hard to ever match the first motion picture that went from black and white to color.  Great trivia question.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Hilarious.  Plus Ryan Reynolds is hott. Could have been a little better but it was a movie I have now watched more than once.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Whoever edited the trailer should be given a raise.  It was much better than the movie.  The funniest aspect of the movie is the concept that our two main protagonists (played by Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds), look like a hot blonde model and an old Chinese guy when they're on earth chasing down the dead - a fact that is played up in the trailer.  Yet in the movie what could have been a comical tour-de-force in using this concept is hardly used at all, with little screen time and speaking parts given to the actors who play Jeff and Ryan's covers.  In addition we get a particularly sad script and plot with most of the focus apparently given to creating action sequences with equally sad looking CGI-created dead.  A definite thumbs down to what could have possibly been an extremely funny movie.
0316204366|5.0|Malcolm finds all these little facts and figures and things that happen in life and brings them to my attention.  Just great to know someone is out there matching up things. Makes life interesting and as I say &#34;Interesting day, interesting life&#34;
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I am an avid woodworker and calculating fractions in the shop is a real pain.  Since my Android phone is always with me, I can now do this painlessly.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Good series to bad it was cancelled so soon.  First time I watched this was on amazon prime.  Wanting to watch movie next.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This was a quick light read for me. Funny and still had a good mystery. A good book to just relax with for a few hours.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />This book was a lot of fun. For some reason I thought it would be more serious, maybe because of the whole death prediction, but it really wasn't. It wasn't completely over the top ridiculous, but light-hearted fun. I loved how Rose's visions were rarely anything super important like you would normally see. I also enjoyed how she just blurts out what she sees and because they are so random it just makes it a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />I like Joe and guessed what was going on with him pretty early on, though of course not in extreme detail since you don't really know what exactly is happening until pretty late in the book. Their back and forth, not quite sure if they should trust the other person or what the other person was up to was fun to watch. Obviously they both liked each other, and I liked how it wasn't insta love they are going to move in together and get married and be happily ever after. It was more realistic, but still kind of silly at times.  Oh the other thing I liked about Rose was her whole strange what is evil what is not thing. Like I know she gets that from her mom, but talking about drinking a beer for the first time and stuff was quite humorous. Stuff that people do everyday, but she has never done, were fun to explore through her thoughts.<br /><br />The one character I didn't really like was Violet. Really Rose's mom was horrible, but she is supposed to be. I couldn't quite figure out if you should hate Violet as well or not. I know Rose is grateful to her for a lot, but Violet really wasn't supportive of the changes in Rose.They are still sisters and obviously care about each other, but I will be curious to see how their relationship is in the next books if Rose keeps growing and changing as a person.<br /><br />The main thing I liked was the light-hearted tone of the book. Everything Rose did seemed to make things worse, when really it was all just coincidental. It was a fun read and I look forward to reading more by the author.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]author.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]
B0068FYZ84|5.0|We loved it when my kids were little; they love it when THEIR kids are little! This movie is a treasure.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I originally got this game for my daughter but I admit I'm rather addicted myself. Its not one of those games you have to sink a bunch of money into to in order to keep going. We have really enjoyed playing it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was fun and exciting.  Different kind of love story.  Liked the characters in the book and the different turn the story takes.  It appears Christina's past was a little scary for my taste, but like his relationship with Ana.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so glad kindle finally made it available. I will probably less productive for a while. I really do not know any people that are not already addicted to this game. Thanks again kindle.
B0053B347M|5.0|I ordered 2 of  these to apply to the back of my two 24\\" monitors to add some back light and act somewhat as a desk light. I do graphic design and sometimes I work crazy hours. It's nice to have the lights on and not light up an entire room. As far as reducing eye strain, I haven't noticed but i'm used to sitting here for hours without it. When you receive the lights please note there is a clear, thin protective layer of film over the lights. Remove that film and they will be noticeably brighter.  I also ordered this tape [[ASIN:B00004Z498 B00004Z498]] to help hold the lights on after reading a few reviews. The cord length is appx. 42\\" from the the usb port to the light. I picked up this 4 port usb hub [[ASIN:B00BWF5U0M B00BWF5U0M]] to use as on and off switches for the 2 lights and it all works great. If the cord length isn't long enough, you can always grab an extension from amazonbasics for a few of bucks.  [[ASIN:B00C28L6XI AmazonBasics  Male  Female Extension Meters]]<br />OVERALL I am happy with the lights. The light is bright enough to do what it is intended to do. The usb plug fit nice and snug into the hub with no play. I did add some extra sticky tape to the lights but am not sure it would need it. They seemed pretty sticky to me. Take the time to clean the application area of your monitor or whatever with some rubbing alcohol first to remove any dirt, dust or oils and they will stick just fine.  Oh and the price? Come on...12 bucks? That's pretty cheap for a strip of LED's that require nothing but plugging in to a usb port. An excellent value for someone on a budget, like myself.
B004RKXHZY|4.0|When I started this book I wasn't sure about it. I mean it seemed like it would just be a repeat of the first book, but instead of the boy having a girlfriend the girl had a boyfriend. I almost skipped it since I was just so so on the first book. I am so glad I didn't. This book felt more real. It is one of the few books with high school kids I have read where it actually feels like the characters are teenagers. It was so sweet and just a great read.<br /><br />I loved Lola and her costumes. I was incredibly jealous of her wardrobe and wigs and all of it. I wish I could have had that when I was her age. She is dating Max, who is a little creepy dating someone that young. I mean he wasn't that bad, but obviously it wasn't going to last. 5 years age difference isn't that much when you are older, but at that age it is huge. Lola she seemed very much like a teenager, and not in a whiny annoying way. She was smart, but confused and really thought she loved Max.<br /><br />Cricket was so sweet. When it was revealed what happened to make Lola hate him it was so silly and insignificant and obviously not what really happened. But he still obviously cared about Lola a ton and was so nice. I loved him.<br /><br />The ending was just perfect. I loved how it all played out and how Lola kind of found herself again. I can't wait for the next book to come out now.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]

B003G4W49C|5.0|When Orson Scott Card wrote Ender’s Game, he created a classic for older children (“young adults”) and adults alike.  When compared to most modern action/adventure stories (and movies) the pace of Ender’s Game strikes me as a bit slower.  Even so, there’s plenty of action, suspense and drama as the reader follows young Andrew “Ender” Wiggin through his training the military Battle School in order to make the cut to continue to be groomed for eventual command.<br /><br />The story is set far in the future, after Earth has recovered from an attack by a hostile species referred to as “the Buggers”; an attack that nearly annihilated humanity.  In an attempt prepared for a future Bugger war, children are screened and selected for battle training in a special schoolhouse orbiting the Earth.  The hope that some will show the right tactical and command skills, and have the overall mental capacity as they move into adulthood to make them qualified and capable of commanding a fleet of warships.  This book focuses on young Ender’s training and testing as a child.  Removed from his family at a very young age, his adventure is often less than pleasant and at times brutal.<br /><br />Without spoiling the end, events take a dramatic turn late in the book, having a lasting effect on young Ender, and significantly shaping the rest of his life.  This also sets the stage for the subsequent stories contained in what has become known as “Ender’s Saga.”  This book, as well as those that follow, are full of all the good stuff that makes great science fiction--space, ships, a struggle to save Earth, and the hope we have in our youth to move us into the future.  As with all great Science Fiction, Ender’s Game is thick with social commentary and leaves the reader chewing on weighty ethical questions once the story ends.  This is great book for adults, and a wonderful tool for parents to share with their kids when the time is right.  I believe the discussions over the lessons that apply to real life will last for years to come.  Grab a copy and enjoy!the lessons that apply to real life will last for years to come.

B0046ECFRM|3.0|At first Anna really annoyed me. She just complained about how she had to spend a year in Paris. Paris. Poor her. On her first day there she makes a friend and the following day is accepted into the friend group. She has a hot guy she crushes as part of that group and they all keep taking her out and trying to help her fit in. I feel sorry for her that she has such a rough life. If she were all alone and had a hard time making friends and such I would have felt worse for her. As St. Clair said at the end of the first week she needed to get over her fear of sticking out and just get out and do stuff. I understand it can be a bit overwhelming, but geez. You are in Paris - go do and see things! And she is so into movies she never once looked up if there were any English language theaters in Paris? Really?<br /><br />As the book progressed she didn't annoy me as much. It was obvious Anna and St. Clair both liked each other, but neither would really do anything about it. I kind of get that they don't want to be alone and being the first to say something to the other, especially when they both have someone else, is a little scary. After a while though it is like get on with it! Someone say something! St. Clair break up with your girlfriend who you obviously don't want to be with anymore. It is really not fair to them to be wanting to be with someone else so much. And Anna...stop thinking of only yourself and be a better friend to those people who took you in when you had no one! She was still annoying throughout the book, but I could deal with her better by the end. Really by the end I was enjoying the story.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]
006202406X|1.0|WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!<br /><br />So, I waited a year for Allegiant to come out. I pre-ordered my kindle copy 3 months in advance, and was thrilled when it came out. The beginning wasn't slow--just like Divergent and Insurgent, so I was excited to see how the series would come to a close. There are several things completely WRONG with this book.<br /><br />1. She wrote the first two books from Tris's point of view. She is our narrator and protagonist. But, in Allegiant it switches between Tobias and Tris as narrator. I thought this was kind of exciting at first, to get a glimpse into Four's mind. But this was done so poorly, that I was more irritated than ever. As a writer, Veronica Roth is not well versed. She obviously never took any advanced english courses, which, yes, are very important if writing is your chosen career. Sure, she has a raw talent, but she should know that if you choose to have 2 narrators, they need to have their own unique voice, diction, etc. Tobias and Tris sound EXACTLY the same, and I sometimes would get confused and forget who was currently speaking. HATED that.<br /><br />2. Seems like she had all these ideas in her head and just wanted to finish the series fast to get her money's worth. She didn't map out the plot at all, or so it seems. It was confusing at times, and not creative at all. Too many things going on at once, and it was more chaotic than exciting.<br /><br />3. Character development was extremely lacking!! Tris and Tobias's relationship is dead in this book. It's just--blah. No advancement. No depth. Just making out and wanting to have sex. I understand they are teenagers, and have raging hormones. I have no problem with sexuality in a book, but it was all they did. They made out to avoid talking. What a horrible example of young adult relationships. Also, all the other characters were extremely lacking and boring. She also introduced new characters, and didn't develop them at all! David, Matthew, Zoe,Nita...I can barely remember who is who because they were so unimpressionable.<br /><br />4. Of course, I am ANGRY about the ending! Tris dying was not expected, and left the book with a depressing: \\"no matter how brave, triumphant, and determined you are, you will die\\" feeling. It was sloppily done, and made no sense. Veronica Roth claims Tris had to die because she had an \\"unbreakable connection with her faction and parents\\" and it would be \\"the only way she could honor their deaths.\\" Excuse me? They died FOR her. And she is honoring them by sacrificing herself?! Shouldn't she honor their death by living?! She always played hero, and it kinda got old.<br /><br />Overall, I had to read this book to finish out the series in my mind, but I was soooo disappointed with it. It was poorly written from a writing perspective and a plot perspective, it was rushed, depressing, and DRY. It was really boring. Especially the epilogue. If you were a die-hard Divergent fan like me, you might want to read it just to get closure, or at least read a synopsis of it. But other than that, don't waste your money or your time reading this. Can't believe how disappointed I am.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was the worst ending to a trilogy EVER!!!!!<br />Spoiler<br />So tris was the only one in the world that could survive the death serum and you just kill her. And how does Evelyn all a sudden just give up her power for Tobias it just doesn't make<br />sense.  Why did you leave four heart broken . I will NEVER READ ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR BOOKS!!!!!!!!!!!! I really don't even think this book deserved  a star.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I loved Ender’s Game and was eager to finally read this sequel.  Initially I wasn’t sure how the story would unfold but it took off quickly, building on the momentum created in the first book.  According to Orson Scott Card, Speaker for the Dead was the story he originally set out to tell.  Reinforcing what Mr. Card said, as good as Ender’s Game was, it only sets the stage for this story.<br /><br />As with Ender’s Game, social commentary is at the heart of this amazing story, and the reader watches the practical results of the now mature thoughts and consequences of Andrew “Ender” Wiggin’s youthful act of xenocide committed against the Buggers.  In an attempt to address, put into context, and perhaps even redeem himself from the savage act of xenocide, Andrew authors two books, “The Hive Queen” and “The Hegemon”, and becomes the first of a non-religious order referred to as Speakers for the Dead. Through these two books, and his words as a Speaker for the Dead, Andrew strives as an adult to limit (if not prevent) any future act of xenocide.  Triggered by the practical calling for a Speaker for the Dead to address the death of several humans on the colony planet Lusitania, we watch a larger story unfold when the resultant moral doctrine contained in “The Hive Queen” and “The Hegemon” play out as decisions are made about how to practically deal with the much more significant emerging conflict between the Human and another sentient race called the Pequininos.<br /><br />There are very few plot holes, but they’re not of consequence in the end.  They’re easily overlooked and quickly overcome by this amazing story.  If you liked the original story and haven’t read this sequel, please do.  You won’t be disappointed.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I rarely ready the synopsis before starting a book. I have read it at some point, but I download a lot of books so by the time I get around to reading it I don't remember what it is about. I started this book and thought oh North Korea, I can't wait to read more. I find the subject matter very interesting. Ever since I read Nothing to Envy I've been interested in learning more about the country. This book, even though there were things in it to help indicate it was set in that country, could have been set anywhere. It was an American book and if you took out the announcements and such it could have been set there. The characters seemed American, the way the spoke and acted and such, not North Korean. I kept having to remind myself that this book was set there.<br /><br />We read this book for my book club and it was interesting to hear their opinions of it. Another lady there had read the other book on North Korea like I had and she disliked this book as much as I did. For everyone else this was their first glimpse of North Korea and they enjoyed it much more. Didn't love it, but they felt it was more info on North Korea and what it is like to live there than we did.<br /><br />This book gets pretty ridiculous pretty quickly. By the end it is just this huge farce and just...it just annoyed me. The first half of the book I found pretty boring and the main character just switches up what he is doing a lot. The second half I enjoyed a lot more, but I still didn't love it. I did think the interrogators sections were interesting, and I liked the announcements throughout, but I really disliked the main characters sections.  He is in love with Sun Moon for no good reason, he has her tattooed on his chest and saw one of her movies. I never really understood why he never defected as he didn't have anyone to think about. Then the end **spoilers ahead** was so stupid! He risks quite a lot to get Sun Moon out of the country so nothing will happen to her because he loves her so much when in reality she is probably one of the best off people in the country besides the dear leader! The dear leader loves her and will do anything she says, so Jun Do helps her escape and causes tons of people to suffer and die because of it and why? So that she doesn't live a life of luxury in North Korea? If he wanted to help people he should help people who actually need it, not get people killed for someone who doesn't even need his help. It was frustrating and I just really didn't like his character.<br /><br />Overall I don't understand all of the high praise for this book. It was an American writing about America, or wait it is supposed to be North Korea (but is not written so it comes off that way). It was just not a good story and just really ridiculous and boring at the same time.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]much when in reality she is probably one of the best off people in the country besides the dear leader!

I also prefer the live version's of \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\" and \\"Life During Wartime\\" from the CD \\"Stop Making Sense\\" to the studio versions represented here, just a personal preference.

8866137634|4.0|I love the moleskine notebooks but have migrated to One Note over the years.  I love having an electronic notebook, they are so much easier to organize, search and reference than their analog cousins.  When I saw this Evernote Moleskine I was so excited!  All the benefits of an electronic notebook with the pleasure of actually writing.  Well, the truth is somewhat less glamorous.  Yes, I can write to my hearts content in my notebook.  I can tag them with little stickers and then take pictures to automatically pull an image into Evernote.  I have yet to figure out how to make it searchable or how to add extra notes or other bits to the photos.  So.. it is cool but there is a ways to go before it is fully functional.  They need to make it text searchable and allow you to do all the cool editing.  I think we are about 85% there.  Great notebook and a kind of gimmicky link to it's electronic equivalent.

1451626096|3.0|My feelings on this book are mixed.  First, I commend Ms. Gregory for attempting to bring to live an historical figure, who despite her importance in history, has had very little written about her.  As with all her novels, Ms. Gregory does take liberties with history.  Yet she does make a good case for some of the rumors she puts forth as fact. I can believe that Elizabeth was “taken” by Henry and was pregnant when she married (she did give birth after only eight month of marriage), that Elizabeth Woodville was sent away for conspiring against Henry (she was known for her schemes), and that Warbeck was actually Richard of York. I could also understand that there would have been tension in the marriage when Henry executed Elizabeth’s relatives.  But that’s where my agreement with the writer ends.<br />First, I found Elizabeth’s actions and feelings inconsistent.  She loved Richard and dismissed all his actions as “things he had to do.”  Then she loved Henry but couldn’t forgive any of his actions?  Personally, I don’t believe she was in love with Richard. She may have wanted to be queen and may have had a girlish crush, but I don’t think she gave herself to him. Even assuming that Richard had nothing to do with the disappearance of Elizabeth’s brothers, he did plenty that most women would have despised.  He had Elizabeth and her siblings declared illegitimate. He usurped the throne from her brother. He had Elizabeth’s half brother and uncle executed on flimsy charges. And, even if he didn’t kill them, he locked up the princes in the tower with no intention of ever letting them out.  On the other hand, Henry was protecting his reign and the future reign of Elizabeth’s children against real threats, and Elizabeth wanted him to lay off? She had no problem with Richard locking up her dear brothers, but Henry was cruel for locking up her cousin?  It was ok for Richard to kill her older brother and uncle for no reason, but Henry was a tyrant for killing Perkin Warbeck, whomay or may not have been her brother and who DID gather support of foreign leaders and raised up an army against the Tudors, which included her children.<br />I also had a problem with the story of Henry’s affair with Lady Catherine.  Kings’ affairs were accepted, even expected, in those days. The affairs of his father-in-law and his son are well documented. Yet there is no evidence that Henry ever strayed. Most historians believe that Henry was a devout man who came to truly love and revere his wife. Their marriage may have started as political, but, accounts from contemporary report that theirs was a happy loving marriage. In fact, Henry VIII always referred to that marriage as an ideal he strove for.<br />My biggest problem with the novel is that I simply didn’t like the main characters.  Despite coming from smart and shrewd parents and bringing forth smart and shrewd children, Elizabeth seems clueless, naïve and somewhat stupid. Her favorite phrase is “I don’t know.”  To paraphrase her husband, all that fine education was wasted on her.  I couldn’t stand Henry either, and couldn’t understand what she fell in love with. In this book, he was an awkward, paranoid, and clueless momma’s boy. And, their growing love was not believable.<br />No one knows how Elizabeth really felt or acted behind the scene.  For such an important figure at such a crucial time in history, I would have preferred a story of a strong, smart, confident woman who was up to the task of bringing together a divided country. I would have liked to see a real growing love between these two.  And, I would have liked to see a likeable Henry who could have been loved by this woman who had been his enemy.

0375869026|5.0|I must forego my usual preamble because I didn't get this book for free. Instead my fiancee recommended it to me on the force of her own positive experiences. In deference to the scads of existing reviews, I'll also do away with my usual positive/negative analysis.<br /><br />Opinions on this book seem to be almost universally positive and I can't really say much to contradict them. Everyone is a little different but most people don't carry their differences in quite such an obvious place as our main character. This makes his view on life and other people quite unique and intriguing. It struck me very similarly to 'Golden Boy' by Abigail Tarttelin though this treatment of the subject is safer for children and more focused on the outside viewpoints of those around the protagonist.<br /><br />The only negative opinions I've encountered seem rather baseless and boil down to the trite statement that it is somehow &#34;boring&#34;. While I don't share any iota of that opinion, it is worth noting, however, that the book is targeted at pre-teens so it's not overwhelmingly complex in either theme or structure. Wonder also takes a very circumspect view of the narrative, showing the situation from the viewpoint of everyone involved in their turn. For more sophisticated readers this is a revealing boon but for the very inexperienced the context switching will take some getting used to.<br /><br />In summary, this one is a book thoroughly recommended for everyone no matter the age. The content is 100% safe for all ages and educational as well. This book won't stop the awkward stares at people with physical differences, but it may at least let the starers know that the people being stared at do notice.

B004GTLFNW|3.0|For a bit of background I'm a former very-amateur power lifter and slightly better Olympic lifter. I'm from the land of Bill Starr and Mark Rippetoe, and found myself living in third world countries with no access typical strength training equipment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- There are a lot of exercises in the book. One very nice thing Mark Lauren did was to present a roadmap to some of the more difficult exercises. A great example is the pistol squat, incredibly effective but also only for those with great strength and flexibility. Mark shows easier exercises (like an assisted single leg step up, or lunges) that help to prepare for the pistol.<br />- The exercises are broken out into body areas which helps for someone to pick and choose but also ensure that they're going about it in a balanced way.<br />- A lot of the ridiculous myths about strength training are laid to rest. It's sad that it's required to do so, but it is, and someone looking to \\"workout\\" and coming across this book will be well served by the general nutrition and training guidance offered.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The author re-brands a lot of existing exercises. A great example is the \\"Let Me Ups\\", which is also known as a supine row or an inverse row, and has been around for a long time. There are also better training guides, better pictures, and more instruction available by a simple Internet search than on the author's \\"Let Me Ups\\".<br />- \\"Blasting\\" some part of your body doesn't mean anything (but is commonly used by the author), and soreness is a bad way to gauge the effectiveness of an exercise.<br /><br />In the end it's a good book to have if only to have so many bodyweight exercises in one place. If you're without a gym you'll probably be trying to find some quality exercises and you can do that with this book. At the same time, you can spend twenty minutes on the Internet and find all the valuable exercises in this book with better write ups, instruction, and images.

1741797802|5.0|I had the oppurtunity to compare this book with many other travel books while I was in India and found that this one was the most detailed and most accurate. I travelled four months without anything but this book and found that everything I needed was in it. The only complaint is that most of the food places were very westernized, they should have some kind of local food option.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this series! Great actors, great scenarios, amazing show. Love how she's still the good wife! 5 stars. Would give a 10!
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I AM 34<br />AND I WATCHED THIS MOVIE ALL OVER AGAIN<br />EVERY TIME IS BROACAST ON TCM<br />I WATCHED SO I DECIDED TO BUY IT TO COMPLETE MY COLLECTION OF DVDS<br />I WATCHED IN SILENCE ON MY ROOM, REMEMBERING THE OLD AND GOOD 80S<br />AND I REALIZE THAT JUST LIKE REBEL WITHOUT CAUSE<br />TEENAGE PROBLEMS ARE THE SAME EVERY DECADE AND THE CLOTHES IT THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGED<br />GREAT MOVIE
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I discovered parts of myself that I thought had sold long ago, all thanks to this great book. Anyone with a dog and eyeballs should purchase this.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|More like a comic book than an adult novel...still enjoyable!<br />The characters are either real bad guys with super powers or resistance fighters.<br />Too one dimensional to rate as one of his better novels.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|It's weird how games like this sneak under the radar on the app store. Great game! I just wish it wasn't the tablet edition. It would be nice to download on my phone. Plays a lot like the first one, which is a good thing. Pick this game up its great for the price
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hard to stop reading,I had to force myself to put it down. A twist at every turn. Not what I expected.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I don't keep up with the latest movies...generally don't care.  It was a rainy afternoon and I felt tired..so I thought this would be a good idea..and it kept me interested throughout.  I thought Danny Devito was terrific in this role.  Actually, I thought all the actors did a convincing job and would recommend this movie.  The message was appropriate for the current times because it is about the behavior of an insurance company regarding denial of coverage for individuals. Matt Damon, Clare Danes, Mary Kay Place and Jon Voight are in it...Great Movie!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I LOVE BATMAN SINCE THE RE RUNS OF THE TV SERIES<br /> I HAVE SEEN ALL THE BATMAN MOVIE  VERSIONS<br />THESE ARE GREAT<br />BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE GREAT<br />MY FAVOURITES ARE TIM BURTON VERSIONS
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This is the best game better than gta vice city so don't wait buy it now if you don't have the money wait till you do
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Had heard what a great show this is so starting at the beginning to learn about all the characters.  Definitely for mature adults only-some scenes are quite graphic.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I never write reviews but i must this time. I waited over a year for this book and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment, ever. I feel bad for recommending this trilogy to other people.<br /><br />The writing was awful. The POV switch every other chapter was just annoying. The ending was pathetic. And like all the other books, he descriptions of things and places lack visualization. But the worst part was the overuse of the word damaged. If i read that word one more time I will seriously vomit.<br /><br />I really liked Four/Tobias in the other two books, I was really looking forward to seeing how his character developed. I can't believe he went from being basically a hero to a dummy that didn't know what to do with himself. How stupid is that? What a crappy way to develop his character.<br /><br />In one word I would say this book was = DAMAGED!!!
B008C20TDG|5.0|it explains everything-why to do these things-not just say becaus the author  i said so. hard to do the 30 day thing but so worth it.,
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|I couldn't imagine a project better than the last but Glasper has out done himself. He must have heard my prayers for what collaborations I would like to hear him do next.
B000077VR3|5.0|THE BEST MUSICAL EVER :)<br />I STARTED WATCHING MUSICALS BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE<br />I RECOMMEND THE MOVIE TO ALL THE PEOPLE FOND OF MUSICALS<br />FOR ME IS AS GOOD AS CHICAGO OR THE SOUND OF MUSIC.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun!  I think it's enjoyable and entertaining.  One of the best games I've played in a while. The visual image is amazing.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I dislike that we lost Tris in this book, that we watch her grow and change and then lose her. She did, although, have an amazing story! Love this series...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this e-book for my wife and she loves it...it must be a good book, she reads a lot but doesn't normally request to purchase too many books, so it must be a good book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I saw my brother play and it looked cool so I downloaded it I wonder if you can play against some other real people post comment below my brother thinks it's pretty cool
B003O86FMW|5.0|amazing book action packed i dont like alot of books, and i would read this one again. Awesome wonderful outstanding loveit.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|THIS IS A FAMILY TRADITION<br />EVERY CHRISTMAS<br />AFTER CHRISTMAS DINNER<br />WE WATCHED THE MOVIE ON OUR VCR ME AND MY SIBLING<br />WERE LITTLE<br />SO I BOUGH IT FOR MY FATHER FOR CHRISTMAS AND WHAT WE DO<br />WE USE OUR DVD PLAYER AND HAD A GOOD LAUGH LAST CHRISTMAS<br />AS WE USED TO DO
B00DPKQ60A|3.0|I have bought this album at a great price and it's good, but it's not groundbreaking! I respect that some people love her, some people hate her and so on! To me, she is just another artist who got an easier break because she was on a hit show from Nickelodeon, but I like her as an artist! What really annoys me is the comparison to Mariah Carey as far as voice! She may be able to hit the high notes ( I've only seen it supposedly in the emotions cover video on You Tube ) but it's not really referenced hardly at all on the album! You can't compare someone of Ariana's age to Mariah's age! Mariah has had her moment in the spotlight during the 90's and given the right times, still sounds great today! Ariana is much younger and she hasn't even reached her prime yet and in the future, her voice won't be the same either! There's a lot in store for Ariana in the future and I can't wait to hear it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have always loved Enders game I read it first in I believe 8th grade I was drawn into the story and the ways it made me feel it was a great book and would highly recommend it to all
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I purchased this e-book for my wife and she loves it...it must be a good book, she reads a lot but doesn't normally request to purchase too many books, so it must be a good book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This has been challenging and fun, with difficulties to over come on each hunt. Anyone would enjoy playing this game.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I don't have the luxury of seeing this show on HBO, but a friend lent me his copy and I loved it so much, so I purchased my own copy..
B008JFUR10|5.0|Oh yeah, the story is stiff as is some dialogue and writing. However, if you love SXF , this is a gorgeous movie on Blue Ray! The CGI artists had no fear with this one, Unbelievable scale, weight and evironments had to be such a challenge, but it was done seamlessly.<br />Upping the ante, some of the Jaeger's and Kaiju batlles scenes take place in oceans! All CG. I loved it and consider this a DVD keeper.<br />Darthvon
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app i mean i have a kindle  fire hd but it only takes photos and now i can take more pics and videos
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was able to download it quickly and immediately start using it.  Had all the basic functions (which was what I wanted) that I needed and was incredibly handy.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Combines so many little details about US history into one story... in the end it's interesting, funny, and actually entertaining.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I continue to enjoy watching this very well made series. The cast is great.  I am awaiting see the third season.
1603429999|5.0|I love this book.  When you read it, it's like having a conversation with the author.  I was especially glad to see a section explaining the problem I was having using double pointed needles.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I enjoy stories that propose some kind of moral dilemma, and this one qualifies. Not quite as enjoyable or compelling as Jodi Picoult books, but not badly written.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is a great classic film that should be shared with every generation!  Get up on your feet and do the time warp!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is the first clock application I have enjoyed having. The app is fairly new for me but so far I have really am happy. I have used other apps that were difficult to use and read not to mention difficulties in setting the application for use. I also am happy with the display and brightness of this application.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Pretty great for a free app! Been playing it and I'm already hooked! Just could use a shorter energy time limit. Definitely worth the download!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I love all the Spiderman movies but this was the best out of all of them.  Tobey Maguire was great and I don't think anybody plays a better Spiderman than him.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|1984 for the 21st century. Delightful dystopia. Who does not see herself/himself in the principal character? Is the digital age a gift or a threat?
B001CTGQBK|5.0|my favorite movie of all time.  I am sure I have seen this movie a hundred times. you must have this movie for your collection :))

B003O86FMW|5.0|If u plan on reading this book, clear your schedule now. It's heart wrenching, attention grasping, painfully brilliant, I couldn't stop reading an when I got to the end, I bought the third book IMMEDIATLY!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent story about a period of which I had little knowledge.  I have recommended this book to others who also enjoy historical fiction.
0671646788|5.0|Although this is an older book, it's a wonderful read that can help anyone move from mediocrity to great success in life through a change in thoughts and beliefs. I love the fact that this author emphasizes that we take action to reduce fear, which is exactly what I did to create my first successful business. Although I was scared, I took action and the fear diminished. This classic book is a permanent part of my book collection. Review submitted by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled \\"Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun psssing the time playing it.very challenging, you have to get druends to help you. Watch out  veey addicting.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This book was an excellent book that had a more personal touch for Harry Bosch, the twists and turns keep you in the story line and you'll be completely surprised by the killer. Overall an excellent read for anybody who likes mystery and suspense. Can't wait to start the next book of the Harry Bosch series.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|my daughter loves it. Works well, not laggy. Has kept her busy and interested for hours. Very quick download time.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|A great read. There is controversy whether or not this is a true story, but who cares? It's a GREAT story. Honestly, it resonates real to me. Read it and see what YOU think. I loved this book!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great that we can improve our health so easily by avoiding some food!  Another book,  &#34;Grain Brain&#34; deals with how the same food<br />influences our neurological system.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the most insightful books I read on Lincoln and his time. Highly recommends to anyone who wants to know more about Lincoln.
B0091REZMW|5.0|As long as your patient you don't really have to buy anything to continue on. I love it. Very Additive. Waiting for the energy to restore ensures you don't fly through the game.

B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is a decent way to kill time, however the puzzles are a little on the easy side for anyone who is experienced with these types of logic puzzles. Would be great for a beginner to learn how to solve them.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played  on a mobile davise  in my life if there was a hall of best mobile game it wood be in the hall.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an outstanding book. This story gives such a great feeling of hope for success. Of Mice and Men is a true classic. John Steinbeck is a genius. The symbols, references, and themes that he uses are remarkably thoughtful and relatable to anyone who reads this book. It tells the story of two men who work as farm laborers named George and Lenny. George is a man with plans to live the \\"American Dream\\" during The Great Depression. Lenny is a mentally challenged man who is like a younger brother to George. George promised Lenny's aunt that he would take care of him when she died. They both go off to work on the farm with their minds set that as long as they go on with their plans they will be living on their own farm providing for themselves off their own crops. The greatest part about this book is how everything comes together in their plans in the middle of the story. They really got that chance starting from nothing with a low salary job to make something of themselves, but John Steinbeck explains how \\"ones best laid plans can go awry.\\" This story really teaches you the reality of life. \\"Things Happen.\\" This is one of the few books that I actually felt was worth my time reading. I give this 5/5 Stars. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a quality meaningful story that isn't time consuming.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game....always entertaining and different and challenging. I have never have been bored with it like some of the other games I have purchased.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is really cool and fun I love to play it I hope that the creator makes more levels. Great idea and graphics are awesome
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Kept me going wondering where Pendergast was going to end up next.  Good suspense, fast moving.  Took u into nooks an crannies wondering how to get out.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I loved Tony Bennett's Duets collection so I had to have Duets II.  It's ever as good as the first set so if you like Tony Bennett's Duets, you'll be happy with this second work.  Good tunes, good arrangements, great voices.  Good listening never gets old.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Warms my heart and the hearts of my daughters. We watch Forest Gump every Christmas Eve. It has become a tradition.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I was obsessed with this album for like two weeks in the spring of 2013.  I had a chance to see them live, so either I didn't like it as much as I thought, or maybe I didn't want to ruin how much I dug their studio work.  Probably the second option, I suppose.
6305358613|5.0|Great acting , great directing , over all a great movie.  I recommend everone who loves history to watch otr own this.  i have alreasy seen this movie many times.
143911000X|3.0|Love the How I Met Your Mother, series... this was just great to add to Barney and his spectacular performance.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a truly amazing product.  I was able to install it in just a few minutes.  The HD videos look great with no buffering while the movies are playing.  Highly recommended.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Funniest movie ever of all time I think that it is a great movie with lots of random parts you don't expect
B00B9LNLTQ|2.0|I was excited for this to come out.  I put it in my car, and then I pulled it to put it in my home system as I did chores.  I must have listened to this a dozen times through, but nothing caught me.  I pulled it and put it up, and nothing in me has said since then, &#34;Listen to that Strokes album.&#34;  I wanted to like it, and I didn't.  That may be the worst possible criticism.  I just didn't work for me. I hold out hope for next time.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Great acting , great directing , over all a great movie.  I recommend everone who loves history to watch otr own this.  i have alreasy seen this movie many times.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Looks amazing on the Kindle Fire HD. Definitely worth a buy. :) I'm also happy to see that I don't seem to need an internet connection to play this game like I do when I try to boot up any of the final fantasy games that I run on my android phone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|waiting for more updates.  please update soon.  love the game just not enough floors.  very challenging but not too hard.  takes a little attentiveness.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|it's a  good game.  only flaw ifs it want load all the time.needs a easyer way to earn coins. other then that its great
B00G32TD98|4.0|Very well paced ghost story. James Wan is re-branding himself well from a slasher-gore filmmaker to a ghost storyteller. Characters are quite believable and the establishes time and place very well. And the scares are memorable, to say the least.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's challenging,and very addictive.  My favorite game on my android!!! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out on a lot of fun.!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The product is easy to install and broadcasts well. It does need more portals. I hope CHROMECAST is working on it. A financial or another movie portal would be great.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is so fun but there's energy which is disappointing the first game you had to buy other robots now there's energy but other than that this  game is amazing
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Good straight forward examples and references from other great writers. positively a good book to start with if one wants to change their mind frame to be positive.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Pretty entertaining.  I particularly liked the easy reading and the unexpected multi-ending.  Makes you ponder about walking in somebody else's shoes while you go about solving life issues.
B003JTHWPA|4.0|McCullers writes in a very straightforward style, seldom seen in today's literature.  Her sentences are simple, her thoughts precise, yet between each line, between each word there is a wealth of thought and consideration that she has precisely placed.  Somehow, without the reader's realization, the characters are developed, their complex relationship expanded upon verse by verse. At first you think this is a simple story but by the end, the reader comes to know how far from the truth that really is.  Easy to read, much harder to explain and understand, but well worth the effort.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I gave a 5 star rating because this book, it's plot and characters, held my interest completely and I ended up reading late into the night because I just could not put it down.  Much thought and imagination went into the creation of this first part of the Silo Trilogy.  I have since read the second part &#34;Shift&#34; and found it equally engrossing.  I am in my 60's and don't usually read books of this genre, but there is something about this series that, in my opinion, will appeal to readers of all persuasions!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm just very happy the app. is out for kindle fire ive been waiting very very patiently. Thank you so much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun. If I wanted to I would play this game all day. Minion Rush is better than temple run!!!!!!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Good episode I like the direction the show is going in. Excited to see what will happen next with the main characters
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read. Could not put down. John your back in the game ..Can't wait for more of Mr.Jake trial' s to come
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun and very addictive. May be hard for the little ones to grasp the concept of. Enjoy
B00992CF6W|1.0|now that you have to pay money to play nonlinear its a ripoff you have to pay for the game and then you have to pay even more to go online
B000002LMK|5.0|This is one of my favorite car-trip songs.  White Line and @#$%&!in' up will push the speedometer dangerously high... so be careful.  Even the characteristically long songs like Love and Only Love and Over and Over maintain good intensity.  This compilation reminds me a little of Rust Never Sleeps, with a few folky bits (Days the Used to Be) mixed with plenty of Rockin' songs and some ego-less goofiness (Farmer John).
B00CATSONE|4.0|Crisp but very informative book about Nikola Tesla. Never though a free book would be this interesting. Probably won't read it again but its good for one time.
B00G32OER4|5.0|The movie is and suspenseful but not gory.  In other words it is a great horror flick. The acting was also better than most horror movies I have seen. You won't be disappointed by this movie if you like to be scared but not grossed out.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It's a good story to read but a lot of anticipation was put on this book and it failed significantly to my disappointment. The truth was told too soon and the twist and turn and foreshadowing fell short. It seemed like the third book copied the ideas that happened in the first 2 books. Then good characters die for thin reasoning. Sadly disappointed by the plot and it was a boring read.
B005OP7162|5.0|It's a fantastic show. The plot is deep and mysterious for each new episode, one can never tell what's coming next. I didn't start watching this until late in season 2, but sometimes found it hard to follow the story line without having seen the earlier episodes. Seasons prior to 3 are not available on Xfinity or OnDemand (SHAME on Comcast), so I had to resort to Amazon and watch it streaming on my laptop. I purchased the download version to download to my KindleHD, but it downloaded 2 episodes and will not download any more. Amazon should make it downloadable directly to a computer, not limit to Kindle (BTW, my Kindle by no means meets my expectations; wish I had purchased a different pad).
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good fun game. Nice and easy to play makes time go by when waiting for time to go by. Would suggest this for everyone.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Hepburn shines and the laughs are contagious.  This is one of those movies which make you wonder why they don't write them like that any more, why they don't make them like that any more, and then you realize that it is the talent of the cast and crew that have given youa most enjoyable experienc.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play CCS through Facebook, and was so excited to see it available for my Kindle.  Now I can still play when I am away from my computer.  No difference from the Facebook game and was able to start at the same level (200) I was online!!  Nice to be able to continue my Candy Crush &#34;addiction&#34; wherever I am!!
0060987464|5.0|Disturbing but definitely a very good read. Marilyn Manson at his best. Very happy with the purchase and the book itself!
B009K0P10K|5.0|L LOVE Revenge! Great Show. Had to purchase from Amazon because Comcast/Xfinity has not made prior seasons available to watch on television.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is nice to have you back writing what you do best. Loved the characters, the situation, and the legal aspects. Welcome Back.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Truthfully, I couldn't get into this book and did not read it.  Therefore, I can't rate it. I gave it to sommeone else to read and hope they enjoy it.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|No issues and it has proven to be reliable.<br /><br />For travel purposes, however, it is a bit too bulky.  I eventually abandoned it for a slimmer product (Unitek Ulta-Mini).
1401307450|5.0|Huge RHCP fan so of coarse I had to read the book! No regrets! I could listen to Anthony's stories for the rest of my life and never get bored.
1582701709|3.0|Very disappointed. Hard to understand, a lot of it made no sense to me.<br /><br />My brother watched the documentary, and said it was much better.<br /><br />I'll have to catch that, next.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The thought of another harrowing tale in the life of Jake Brigance was too much to consider. Grisham pulls it off in fine fashion in a tale that delivers on his characteristic style. A must read for even the casual Grisham fan!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|That was an awesome way to spend a long afternoon!!! Great characters! These were all quirky but whole people - he manages to drop the reader right into their lives - doesn't spend a huge amount of time on setup despite the fact that we need a lot of background to understand where we are. This was great because like meeting another adult you get the background as they work through the present moment. The father was really well written - I saw the movie and was really disappointed at how this character was made &#34;likeable&#34; - in the movie he doesn't change - doesn't grow. In the book his struggle was intense - all the characters grew and developed and transformed in the book. Great read!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I had chosen this book based on the reviews . It seemed like it was going to be great. I have to be very honest it took me 2 months to get througjn chapter 15 if you can make it up to there then the book starts to pick up. I like a book to grab me from the beginning this does not. But I'm the type of person that must finish the book. It turned out to be fairly interesting. But to be perfectly honest I would not recommend it to anyone sorry .
B003G4W49C|5.0|A lot of truism woven into this story, beautifully disquized as Science Fiction. Loved the whole story,  seems I read Enders Game in a collection of short stories oh so many years ago. Now I can`t wait to see the movie, which is never as good as the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is cool and  the game is a lot of fun I like how each board is different . The game is very nice free app. I would recommend this game for  someone that is ready to have fum
B005KAH7QU|2.0|The plot was boring.  Once the story started to develop I was able to see exactly where they were going with it.  My indication of a good show is by asking myself: &#34;Would I ever want to watch that again?&#34; The answer to that question is a solid, &#34;No!&#34;
0061537969|5.0|I have grown to love this book more and more since I read it. I enjoyed reading it - it was easy and quick and kept me glued to the page. And then after reading it has become one of those books I talk about often - one that I recommend frequently to all sort of friends. So please - read this book - you don't have to love dogs although I imagine that adds to the joy of the story - likewise you don't have to love things like F1 or any car racing or even sports cars but again... I imagine that just adds to the pleasure of the story. It's probably enough if you just know a father or a guy who has a good heart.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I hate spoilers, so I will try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible.<br /><br />I fell in love with this series from the very beginning, and despite some very mixed reviews from others about Allegiant, my opinion remains. I will miss this story and these characters dearly. I disagree with the other reviewers who hated the ending. I thought everything that happened was perfectly aligned with who these characters were and how they evolved though out the series. Ms. Roth took chances with a beautiful and complex story to find its conclusion. I feel blessed to have found this trilogy and I'm heartbroken to see it end. A big thanks to Veronica Roth for her brilliant writing and storytelling.<br /><br />I want to add that I completely understand the reasons that so many people are upset. I agree on some level. They also don't make me love the story any less. Bad things happen and many stories don't have fairy tale endings. Especially in dystopian literature. I just hope that those who loved the first two stories start Allegiant with an open mind, not one clouded by reviews, and continue reflecting back to Divergent and Insurgent throughout it to make sense of how it ends.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The book was sooooo much better!!! The father in the movie is a completely different sort of character, and there's way more football in the book. The main character in the book has so many more dimensions about him - he goes through significant struggle and transformation. The movie characters were prettier in general than they were in the book - far less risky I guess. Bradley Cooper is always great to look at and I love Robert De Niro - but I think the screen adaptation and directing were timid given the characters that Matthew Quick created in his book. There was opportunity to take great characters and combine them with great actors and produce a great movie - but that opportunity was clearly missed with this very watered down version. If you haven't read the book it's probably a fun movie to rent... Even if you have seen the movie - if you like to read go get this book - it's a great way to spend an afternoon.
1586216880|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it presented a view of his life as he perceived and experienced it.  I believe that Nelson Mandela made an effort to be transparent and forthright in explaining his position and the events that caused him to become the freedom fighter that he became. I was particularly impressed by his humanity and his ability to forgive the violent acts perpetrated against himself and others who were fighting for the cause.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This is a fun goofy movie to watch.  What really makes this movie standout is that it doesn't take itself so seriously, poking fun of all the high-tech gear that is used in it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love this author -- I have read many of his books.  History comes to life with the characters he crafts. As usual, his books are long -- originally &#34;borrowed&#34; the e-book for my Kindle; since our library only allows 2 weeks on a e-book loan, I purchased the book mid stream -- and found my place right where I left off!  I am enjoying this one just about as much as &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; (another Ken Follett novel) -- I would recommend this book to any reader who enjoys a fictionalized account of history.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book, not quite as much as &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34;, but would still recommended it highly.  Definitely worth reading if you have enjoyed Liane Moriarty's work previously and, if you have not read her yet, give this one a try.  Both &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; and &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; are great weekend reads....fast moving and interesting storyline....hard to put down!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It was kind of slow but a decent story line. I felt at times that I had seen the same story line but it was kind of a unique idea in some aspects.
1451666179|5.0|This book is so funny that while I was reading, I started laughing so hard I had to remind myself to breathe. And that is why you should buy the book, because you need to have something you can pick up at any time and just bust a gut laughing.
044024630X|2.0|This is the second Jack Reacher book I've read and it was remarkably similar to the first - Worth Dying For - although much better but saying it was much better does not mean it was good.<br /><br />Once again the \\"hero\\" (for I assume, six foot five psychopath Reacher is a hero to the author and his fans) finds himself in a rather remote location in the American backlands and proceeds to sort all the bad guys out.<br /><br />Although he is a military policeman and presumably subject to military and civilian law, his methods including breaking necks, blasting a baddy's head off at point blank range and, best of all... well, I had better not say as it will \\"ruin\\" the plot if that is possible.<br /><br />Anyway, Jack Reacher may be Superman but he is certainly not Clark Kent.<br /><br />At times, the book is readable and engaging but it quickly becomes repetitive and just plain unconvincing. It is also so disgustingly violent at times with excruciating descriptions of how to inflict pain and death on people that I wonder if the author ought to see a shrink.<br /><br />I realize it is just a thriller and the reader has to accept a lot but Child just stretches things too far.<br /><br />For example, we are supposed to believe that the sheriff in the town Reacher visits is a beautiful 36-year-old former marine.<br />However, she lives in a grungy room in a rundown hotel, eats breakfast, lunch and dinner in a greasy spoon diner and does not seem to be interested in having a husband, children, decent clothes,  her nails done or going to the supermarket.<br /><br />No wonder she falls for Reacher whose idea of haute cuisine and an intimate dinner is a cheeseburger followed by pie and coffee and whose romantic ideas stretch to making love on a railroad track while the midnight special screams as it thunders along above the loving couple's head.<br /><br />What a guy! What a gal!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wonderful story telling. An epic adventure staying true to Robert Jordan's vision. A truly remarkable accomplishment in Jordan's choice of Sanderson.

B008RA3X5E|1.0|Battery hogger. Installed unit one evening and battery life was showing 82% before closing down. Next morning battery was dead flat. Charged to 100% and within minutes it was dropping rapidly without any applications open. Went to 71% within 10 minutes. I deleted alarm clock from apps and everything was back to normal. Beware.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast has proved to be such a useful purchase!  Install was almost seamless.  I have successfully used Chromecast on six different TVs without a hitch.  The quality of Hulu+ and Netflix (the main two things I utilize) have been exceptional.  This little bugger is great for people who travel often, want to turn their TV into a smart TV, or someone who likes to show off their tech prowess.  I did notice a slight loss of quality when transmitting YouTube.  Also, I've been at a friend's house and their router was rather mediocre, and the Chromecast reflected this via loss in quality/random loss of connection.  I would recommend, and have recommended this product, to all of my friends and family!
B0045HCJRG|4.0|Great movie - timeless fun. Like the cast and the idea behind the story. I grew up in that era.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|This music has taken to me what I admired in Peter Gabriel to another level...................saw them open up for Jane's Addiction in San Diego, and although I was not at all familiar with their music, they stole the show.............mink, and more.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Pacific rim had over the top special effects but the story line was choppy and the characters lacked character. It was an OK movie so long as you are in it for the boom effect.
B00EJYGL8S|4.0|The Piano Guys (TPG) give a new spin to well known classic Christmas songs with their refreshing instrumental arrangements plus two new TPG originals in this 'A Family Christmas' CD. TPG display great piano and violin combination playing in this CD release and refreshing approach in the variety of arrangements as from wonderful yet mellow/tearful track \\"Still, Still, Still\\", slow-tempo tracks like the closing \\"Silent Night\\", up-tempo musical score type playing in the track \\"Carol Of The Bells/God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\", the 'marching piano/violin playing' in the track \\"Let It Snow/Wonder Winterland\\", the 'wavy playing' in the track \\"We Three Kings\\" and my pick of the best track from this great CD \\"Christmas Morning\\" (up-tempo melodical playing).<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" (opening mid-tempo track, great melodical piano playing. All four guys playing together in this first single supported by a great video included in DVD or available on YouTube), \\"Let It Snow/Wonder Winterland\\", \\"Still, Still, Still\\" and \\"Christmas Morning\\".<br /><br />On overall, TPG give a wonderful spin on classic Christmas songs with their great melodical piano/violin playing in this CD 'A Family Christmas'. A great gift to loved ones and family.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Really like this movie a lot, as it shows what Nam was to many of us in combat.  There are of course the Hollywood fictional parts that make this another movie that fails to show the truth when it could have.  The end of the movie is entirely fiction, it did not happen.  The US sent 3 divisions into that valley to prove they did not have a clue on how to run that war.  There was over 60% casualties and I do not call that a win.  I was a Recon Sergeant in Nam 69-70 and we were just cannon fodder to those running the campaign.  It was all about body count just like a win/loss statement, that is a term used in gambling and that is what they were doing.  Gambling the loss of American lives and lost over 58,000 of my Brothers and Sisters.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Only the people who have won large amounts of coins win the jackpots and large payoffs. You know the expression, &#34;money comes to money&#34;?  It's very much the case here.  I have never even come close to winning a jackpot or multiple large wagers. I won one large spin of $3.2M coins and have been milking that for the last 2 months. I am still at around that amount. I have tried my luck with the larger wagers but to no avail. Where is the fun when you can't even win at an internet game?

B00E5N8E2O|4.0|The heavy metal band from Sheffield, UK, Def Leppard is rockin' hard in this 2 CD/DVD release titled 'Viva! Hysteria'. This great release was recorded live in The Joint arena at Hard Rock Hotel And Casino in Las Vegas during their March/April 2013 eleven day residency.<br /><br />Disc 1 (14 tracks): their landmark bestseller 1987 album 'Hysteria' (12 tracks) is played in its entirety from track 1 \\"Women\\" to track 12 \\"Love And Affection\\" plus bonus tracks \\"Rock Of Ages\\" (incredible vocal range by Joe Elliott) and \\"Photograph\\" (wonderful harmonies) from their previous 1983 album 'Pyromania'. The band is very entertaining, tight, great vocals by Joe Elliott and great melodical guitar playing. The sound quality is great.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", \\"Run Riot\\", \\"Hysteria\\" (title track: slow-tempo, wonderful melody and vocals) and \\"Love And Affection\\".<br /><br />This is my favourite CD of the two. My musical interest and first exposure in the band Def Leppard was with 'Hysteria' CD released in 1987.<br /><br />Disc 2 (15 tracks): from their opening set each night as the band DED FLATBIRD (supposedly their supporting/opening band/act. How cute is that, hey?)! They play rare and fan favourites from their early years as a band in this set. The band again is very intertaining, tight and great vocals by Joe Elliott. The sound quality is good.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \\"Stagefright\\" (grungy track with great melody & vocals), \\"Action\\" (wonderful heavy metal playing with great melody & vocals), \\"Undefeated\\" (great guitar), \\"Promises\\" (great sound than other tracks in this CD, great pop/rock track with a beautiful melody and melodical guitars) & \\"High 'N' Dry (Saturday Night)\\".<br /><br />Disc 3: the above live tracks with the band captured in HD (for great picture clarity and sound). The band shows great interaction with the fans in this intimate venue and you can see the fans are having a ball oftime at the recording of this great Def Leppard concert.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great story. This is the first time I have read anything by Orson Scott card , I really like his writing and look forward to reading many more of his books. I am also looking forward to going to see the movie that just came out on Friday.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Lots and lots of fun and addicting. Couldn't put it down. Lots and lots of back and fourth. But it holds my interest
B0010T0OCY|5.0|I had never heard of Dark City until it popped up on my recent addition to Prime Instant Videos.  I was drawn by the five star review -- and they're spot on.  Amazon's short synopsis doesn't do it justice.  Think a cross between Brazil and Memento.  Mind bending and fun.
B008JFUNJQ|3.0|I've read the Ender series and enjoyed it.  The movie was a let down, but it did have a few things going for it.  I appreciated the special effects, and thought the kids did a great job.  I've waited a long time for this movie to be made.  The author of the novel was initially hesitant to sell the rights because he allegedly wanted it to do the book justice.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line, the author compromised intensely, and sold out.  The film left out virtually everything that made this story worthy of being told.  I wanted to leave after about 45 minutes, but stayed to see the special effects at the end.  I'm glad I did, but can't say why without giving spoilers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While at first I thought this was just a book about porn it turned out to keep me captivated and caring about the Plot
B005PW3OS8|3.0|Fun story but too caught up in 'cheerleading' team USA to the point of being hokey. Worse is the back story of an improbable romance between the main characters.
B00C6BB2JE|5.0|Amazing edition!! And just for collectors, I expect more steelbook editions like this, thank you very much!! All the special features are just for fans!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Locked up my kindle fire. I got what I paid for with this product, it was free so no harm no foul.  gameloft usually does a better job than that
B006M4F67A|4.0|There is such a variety in your games.  Great job.  The one thing I didn't like is you have to pay some of the games.
1594202273|3.0|Factually a very interesting read. The book's organization  was sometimes confusing. How was the incident tied in to the over all issue of the control of nuclear weapons was never explained by the author. However, with so many accidents involving nuclear weapons of all types, the author has made a good case for the need for better control.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|The opinions about this movie are very divided, many people says it's a mess! And other says it's amazing, specially for the special effects, in my case, I think it's an excellent movie, better 3d effects and better script, very recommended. About the edition, I'd like that has a slipcover which does not have

B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great software program for gaining access to Kindle HD fire files.  It's super easy to use and works like a charm.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series. The first time I started reading the first book, it did not grab me and I put it down halfway through. But a year later after everyone has gotten into the HBO series (though not me - I haven't seen it yet!) I decided to give it another try - and this time I couldn't put it down. The characters are very well developed and the plot line is engaging but not predictable. You think a character is going to be the principal character throughout the series and then he gets killed (or not...) it's heartbreaking but so much more gripping than if you know there will be some deus ex machina coming in to save someone from certain death.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Needed an app to see how long I had before my 5 year old had a meltdown when the battery died. This app does that and much more. You should get it.

B00A77II0U|5.0|I love hidden objects and point &amp; click games!  This is one of the best!  Great graphics and storyline!  Only problem is that the game would stick now and then.  Hope there's a part 2!  Enjoy...
B0040I09RM|4.0|Pretty much, it's a soap opera for men. However, stereotype aside, it's well-written, entertaining, and has a wide variety of characters that are almost immediately likeable - or at least tolerable - and shows a side of motorcycle clubs rarely seen. Definitely worth watching, though I wouldn't let young kids watch it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game you run you can change into a guy collect coins and it is for free you should get it

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by hussein. He is able to pass on to the reader the day to day life, the hardships and relationships. Although it jumps from different families along the story line all adds up at the end
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and addicting game. The entire family plays this game. It is similar in concept to bejeweled and the classic tetris.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Such a wonderfully drawn story...with a heroine I could sympathiize with...Sad, and chilling...but hard to follow...as the author kept jumping back in time and then forward.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Love this game, short levels, easy to pull out and play and then put away.  Needs more levels, though...easy to learn...
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the site and the ideas to make things are great!  I enjoy looking at this page for unique ideas and recipes.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|Classic - must have.  This is one of the all time classics and should be in your collection.  It takes you back to good memories.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Loved the story line, but it took so long to read this novel. So many characters yet they were believable, and I sympathized with all of them,
B00EDPFJA4|3.0|Not as awesome as Thank Me Later but it has some good songs. A little bit more rough around the edges as his previous album.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Excellent start to a new series, entroducing new characters as well as bringing back all of your favorites. Easy to get into and hard to put down.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The \\"Secret\\" is a great start on my journey of discovery and enlightenment, it gave me hope I AM.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book has really helped me thanks a lot. Its well written and all true. Its not one of those self help books that you so often find written by a young inexperience writer giving you advice that ouve heard so many times before that's not actually practical or reasonable so thank yu
B00555X8OA|5.0|Amazing. Take your time, this is not a quick read. Kahneman's self-deprecating humour, and writing style makes the fact that he is a mental giant somewhat less intimidating. Strongly recommend for anyone interested in psycology or behavioural economics.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|An all time classic movie based on the original Frankenstein book by Mary Shelly. The acting is superb, the plot believable, and the creature scary for a film made in 1931.  It movie was way ahead of its time, and the science was at the cutting edge of bringing dead creatures back to life using lightning bolts.  Very believable, exciting and scary, at the same time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for a really long time for this app to open on the Kindle Fire. I'm so excited!! :D

B00D48BT5A|3.0|Bill Bryson is always entertaining but I think this book would be of more appeal to an American reader or a fan of baseball/aviation history.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|The plot was totally predictable, the acting so-so, but the special effects rock!  I enjoyed watching the giant robots defend the Earth from alien invaders, and the politicians acting like idiots. Right on the money.  Great movie for the kids.  Lots of action with giant alien creatures who evolve from scene to scene.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Thirty-two years into their career, British synth pioneers Depeche Mode released their thirteenth studio album, Delta Machine, produced by Ben Hillier, who also produced 2005's excellent Playing The Angel and 2009's solid Sounds Of The Universe. As the album title suggests, the music on Delta Machine is a mix of the Delta Blues (named after the Blues music originating from the Mississippi Delta) and Electronica. This unique combination of Blues guitar riffs and dark, brooding and atmospheric Electro sounds has always been an interesting concept with which main songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Martin Gore has repeatedly worked wonders. Delta Machine received mixed reviews at the time of its release, but the album deserved to be recognized as Depeche Mode's most accomplished and satisfying work since 1997's Ultra.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com

B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|American Lo-Fi Indie Rock act Phosphorescent (a.k.a. Matthew Houck) released his sixth studio album, Muchacho, to widespread critical acclaim. Produced by Matthew Houck and largely recorded by him and a few key session players, Muchacho was conceived, when the singer/songwriter isolated himself in a small community in Mexico (due to mental and physical exhaustion after a tour in support of his previous album, Here's To Taking It Easy). Muchacho took shape, as Matthew Houck went on solitary walks in the woods and swam in the lakes. The rollicking 1970s Country-Rock of Here's To Taking It Easy (think Willie Nelson and early Eagles) still permeates much of Muchacho, but the singer/songwriter has added an unorthodox element in the shape of electronic instrumentation. While this unlikely marriage initially seems like an odd combination, it actually works and makes for a fascinating, creative and distinguished album. Skillfully written, arranged, recorded, produced and engineered, Phosphorescent's Matthew Houck is an extremely talented singer, songwriter and musician with impeccable taste and an impressive attention to detail.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Lovely sweet songs, they are at a little bit of a slower pace than the past upbeat songs. But having said that the songs they produced are sweet and in complete harmony.  Track four is absolutely recommended from me.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|The musicianship is fantastic. I paid for this music as a way to say thank you to the band for going all out to reach the highest heights of excellence.  In a world controlled by the very things the songs are about, the masters of this world promote the lowest forms of mediocrity to debase us all, to perpetually funnel power to themselves, as the mentally crippled dumbed down masses are fed their daily portion of banality. Here, though, we find yet again the light of God shining through by the mere existence of this level of greatness. It is clear these guys pursue the highest and the best. They are an example and inspiration to us all. Despite their often hopeless themes of trying to do the impossible, ie figure out life on planet earth, the fact they reach so high and deliver an honest rendering of the mystery of this life that affects us all, music like this and the people behind it underline that, indeed, hope is alive and well, and that surely something awaits beyond the blue ball, amazing, for those who reach for it. I hope they read my post and please record another great album. Even if the economically controlling money masters have corrupted the masses to accept the most mediocre to be heard on the radio, your music is not only heard by people like me, but I suspect God himself. The quality of your music is defined by who listens to it, not by how much money it makes or how many listen. *This* is what transcends the grave. *This* is what you carry forward. The highest and the best.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|Forty-one years after the release of their debut album, Earth, Wind & Fire (1972), legendary R&B/Funk/Disco group Earth, Wind & Fire released their 21st studio album, Now, Then & Forever. The preceding press release said that Now, Then & Forever would mark a return to the horn-laden signature sound that turned these innovative pioneers into international superstars in the `70s and early `80s. While a partially valid selling point, Earth, Wind & Fire had already made a return of sorts to said signature sound on 2002's The Promise, and, even more so, on 2005's all-star collaboration, Illumination. After more than a decade of Earth, Wind & Fire catering to the stylistically somewhat sterile and simplistic sounds and productions of the times (late `80s, 1990s) - a stark contrast to the lush, intricate arrangements of their `70s/early `80s recordings - they finally successfully updated their signature sound without compromising its warmth and aesthetic.<br /><br />Everything about Now, Then & Forever is a tribute to Maurice White, the group's visionary, original leader, singer, songwriter, musician, producer and arranger. Even if Maurice White is not present on Now, Then & Forever as a creative force, he's there in mind, soul and spirit, and it sounds and feels good.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is really addictive and frustrating at times. You could be stuck on one level for days or months.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Same problem as the first one. These actors seem like caricatures of the original enterprise crew. I guess it's cool  for those born in this generation. I personally didn't care whether they lived or died. The Enterprise seemed more like a prop than a flagship. Since  Abrams was inclined to stray far away from Roddenberry's vision, it would have been better for him to create his own characters rather than to mangle the established icons.<br />Anyway. if you like lots of things going boom and a movie in which almost nonstop action is the overwhelming priority then this is for you.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am enjoying growing and breeding dragons. I just wish there was an easier way to win the gems, as I don't have a lot of friends playing this game who can give me free ones. You can build your Dragon zoo faster if you purchase the gems, and they are reasonably priced. This is a fun game for me.
B00G118LYY|5.0|Fire little game for the children who are into crashing into little cardboard boxes.  Play is good for everyone to enjoy.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Great game, a little nerve RACKING too....Very challenging.  Enjoy the ability to play random unknown players.  Very fun to play on a 7 inch tablet.
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|This is a great movie for adults and kids alike. Love the new characters and the incorporation of older side characters.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|The FBI knows who you are!  One of the movies best lines by Eve Arden.  Like this movie on many levels. (1) John and Olivia (2) 50's actors employed in the film, (3) Music and lyrics. I don't know why I don't own this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am very happy is a excelente product.<br />I like because i can see movies, you tube, and listen the music.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Muscle Shoals has always been as close to THE soul of latter 20th century recorded music as any other scene out there (motown, memphis, etc), so it is good to see them finally get their day on the screen. It's nice to see the human side of some the best recorded music in my lifetime... I mean, you hear these records and never consider that the guys making them put their pants on leg at a time, just like you do. Hell, in some weird way, the recordings they made makes them immortal, as the music will last forever, at least as long as humans have ears and the forests have trees.<br /><br />Excellent documentary.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Amazing movie as good or better then transformers. If your into action and a good story line. You have to watch.
B0015AARJI|4.0|A great controller, but I have had a persistent problem with the left stick occasionally setting off the d-pad buttons if clicked hard. Otherwise, this is a great industry standard controller.
B0088NCE3W|5.0|I read this during a visit just concluded to Jordan and Palestine. In light of the recent Arab Spring, current Egyptian situation and life in Israel's most prophetic
076115678X|4.0|I ended up giving this book only two stars because my daughter developed horrifying green flakes all over her scalp which bled. Then we had to use medicine shampoo for months.  Then I tried CG a second time, tweaked which products I was using, still with the same disastrous results.  Bravely, I forged on a third time (this is all over the course of an entire year) and now we finally have it figured out!!!<br /><br />We figured out that my daughter has a very greasy scalp and needs to use some Low Poo.  But the Deva Curl Low Poo has Mango, which she is allergic to, so we found JessiCurl Low Poo.<br /><br />So she uses DevaCurl for all the other products, and uses JessiCurl twice a week, and for months now her hair has been less frizzy, more healthy and beautifully curly.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but did have some difficulty in the beginning keeping track of who was who due to the introduction of so many characters.  I was also a little disappointed with the ending of the book.  As far as what happened at the end was fine but I felt like I was reading a story for a Lifetime movie.  The majority of the book was spent building up the story and then it all magically fell into place in the last three or four chapters.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I have been a fan of Mazzy Star since the 1990s.<br />This cd is Authentic Mazzy Star!<br />I love this cd
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I am amazed by Sanderson. He is such a great writer. Love his books. Great story, can't wait for more of the series.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|It would be a really great game if you were not so confined by short time spans as well as always running out of energy. The way the game is set up , if you want to play any length of time you must invest money again and again, what a shame. The challenges are there but it becomes extremely frustrating trying to race against the clock.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What can I say?  I am in love with Travis.  He is at the top of my Book Boyfriend list and even after all of the other books within this genre that I have read he still holds a prominent top spot.  I just never get tired of reading this story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's only 4 stars because you have to ask friends and wait to get to the next level or pay. Would like to be able to pass levels and move on.
B00DQZQQN6|3.0|The case is not as sturdy as I would have liked it to be.  It is difficult to hold on to when reading with it.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Killer sounding album.<br />Very addictive beats and lyrics.<br />Probably one of the hottest sounding discs I've heard in a long time.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|The special effects are good, but this seems to be a modern day re-hash of the monsters from Godzilla,  It is a good Sunday watch.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book really challenges us, as women, to take control of our destinies and push forward with our careers. It doesn't discount the fact that we may have families, but challenges us to make room for both if that is our choice. She encourages women to support each other. I read this book for a book club we started for women in the workplace and I am sure we will have a lot of great conversation and actions that come from this book.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Not too much adventure. Some mild experiences and bizarre people. The reading I easy with some humor.  Loved reading about the Northwest. Makes me want to follow her footsteps.
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|This is a great movie, and a great transfer to blu-ray. Love the special features as well, that aren't listed in the posting. Some I've seen before....but it was still great to see them again!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Even if you are not a star trek fan, give it a try, you may like it.  Special effects are great.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|Beautifully directed and well acted. Unflinching look at addiction and its effects on people and their relationships.  I am an even bigger fan of Michael Fassbender's after seeing this and not for the reason one might think.  He is one of the best actors working.  Steve McQueen is on his way to becoming one of the world's best directors.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is a very cute and challenging game, and i love the public safety video that inspired this game.  Reason for four stars is now i cant get the song out of my head..lololol
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Fantastically written, easy to read. Should turn medicine as we know it on it's head (although it won't...not enough people read and network television won't air this info...they'd lose their advertisers). Great info on supplements and all around mental and physical health. Totally worth it!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Action, action, and more action.  The finial fight scene is well--action packed great addition to the Iron Man movies. Enjoy!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have a slowish kindle and I put this on here to see if it would help me and it cleared alot of junk and crap from my kindle making it faster
B00E38KGF4|3.0|I just got it so far I scanned it just once but it didn't finish it stopped at  90% but said it was working so did it freeze so I waited about an hour or two and still said the same so I stopped the scan then restarted it and it did The same.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am happy that it is finally on android. It is fun to play on a bigger screen then a phone. Thanks..
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I was drawn in to this book very quickly. I liked the way the author told the story from the man character's point of view so you discovered everything as he did. Very captivating!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This app is great in my opinion, because it's not a short app like the other apps out there. You've got two go through two Underground championships then two WRB championships and you need to upgrade a lot to progress. You can only buy certain robots after you beat that championship.
B00992CF6W|5.0|An awesome game where you can create almost anything, the sky's the limit! But I think they should add enderman and enderperals and the end , possibly infinite worlds, jungle biomes, and osilots! But other then then that I think minecraft is awsome! I play it every day!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think this game is great. It's just that you don't have anything to do. Well anyway, the game is great and I think you will love it too.  =3
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book gives fans of Superheroes a different look on the common trope. Instead of heroes rising to guard the world, we find the world is now plagued by selfish, powerful Gods. The worst of which cannot be killed in conventional manners, and can wreak havoc wheresoever they see fit.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I just got it because it was the app of the day,but I really like it it is really addicting
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy playing Mahjong games and this one does not disappoint. It is entertaining and also educational. It sharpens your senses and stimulates your brain.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Sick of crappy season endings.  Ready to move on from this series if it doesn't get a bit more light.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not quiet up to Grishams  norm; found the plot a little hard to believe. The ending was horrible, seemed like he just ran out of interest & so did the reader.
0316055433|3.0|This is what Tom Wolfe wishes he could do in drivel like Charlotte Simmons, but Dickens it ain't. Still, it gains a plot around p. 500 that would do Elmore Leonard proud and it's gonna make one helluva movie!
B007THA4FI|4.0|The plot, a council election in a small English village, seems a bit thin. But the characters gradually grew on me, and even the plot finally got beyond the election. So I stayed with the book. There are several really good scenes, and there is a kind of resolution at the end, if in the midst of great sadness. Some of the characters seem to find something like &#34;salvation&#34;. And a couple unpleasant and unredeemed characters at least get a good lesson, and hopefully will learn something. Still, the ending does not tie everything up neatly; it is more realistic than that. A good book and well worth reading if you can stay with it for at least a hundred pages. It is long.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ad the nether please,please it has ghasts pigmen and a lot of lava and a fun amount of fun so ad the nether
B000AJIF4E|3.0|They sounds great, but the rubber ear pieces wear and break over time. not cool. i wouldn't recommend them to audio or video pros.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Enjoyed this read. The reviews were right, it was worth the wait from her previous novel. This one is a bit different, you'll enjoy it, and won't be able to put it down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story!this book is fascinating, easy to read, and unusual. I would never thought that it would end the way it did.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game really needs ti be update its fun and very changeling I hope that ghe update will happen very soon
B0050CQY1W|3.0|I got it for a gift for my wife. she loves Beyonce. Frankly i think she needs singing lessons.  too much screaming. yikes.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is probably one of the most helpful books I have ever read.  I wish I'd had the opportunity to read it when I was younger, but even though I am well into my career (I'm 51), Sheryl's observations and advice were still very relevant for me.<br /><br />Men, don't bypass Lean In because you think it's only for women.  It is worth your time if you are a woman, work with women, manage women, or are raising future women.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I'll tell you what I thought of the book, \\"The Husband's Secret.\\" I'll tell you for sure. But first it occurs to me that reading is a very ordinary, yet very special, activity. Like the time I met my husband, and he was reading, and I thought, huh, this is a guy I could really like, he's reading! Or when you get together with friends and you can tell the ones who read, and the ones who don't read.<br /><br />But back to what I thought of the book, \\"The Husband's Secret.\\" I was sure I would like it. You know, the way you see a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, and you know, from past experience and the memories of taste and the way that chocolate flavor just explodes on your tongue, you know. You just know you're going to like it.<br /><br />There could even be a little suspense. Well not in the cake, but in the book. It's easy to say when this occurred to me, it was just a little while after I decided to write a review.<br /><br />So anyway, if you are still reading, that is my way of demonstrating how reading this book felt to me. I definitely wanted to know what was going on! But not enough to plow through the asides. Actually the asides were bigger than the plot in the pages I read, so maybe I shouldn't think of them as asides. The author did not focus enough (at all) for me, and I gave up after a short time.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|We went into this with low expectations based on reviews but we wanted something to watch with our teen boys an they like sci-fi so we gave it a try.  It wasn't amazing acting and there were some plot holes but overall it was good movie.  We all liked it and felt glad we'd chosen to see it.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I got this app when it was the FAOTD and never played it until last week. I have played it almost every day since then. It has several variations of the game that keep game playing interesting. It allows you to 'pencil in' possible answers, which I use every game. Has multiple difficulty levels, not just easy and hard. I like playing on moderate right now, but I am working my way to more advanced levels. The best thing about this app has to be the hint button. If you get stuck and don't know how to make your next move, it gives you a hint and highlights what area it is referring to. If you can't figure out what that hint is trying to tell you, you can push the '+' button to get that hint simplified. Still don't understand? Hit the '+' button one more time and they tell you flat out what it means. I've used the hints twice and they have drastically improved my technique. I now understand the game so much more!<br />Bottom line: Would I recommend this app to a friend? Yes.<br />  Would I spend $2 on this app? Yes.
B00486070K|5.0|Bought this for my Macbook Air since it doesn't have an ethernet port and sometimes I'm in areas without Wi-Fi or need to do some testing with ethernet.  Not much to say except it works perfectly.<br />Typical Apple product.  No drivers were required.  OS X detected it right away and it started working.<br />This is an older product so I'm hoping that Apple will update it soon with USB 3.0 and Gigabit capability.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it.  Bought 2, one for the main TV, one for a bedroom.  Both TV's are HD.<br />Added so much to the families viewing.<br />Programmed the smart phones, iPad and Kindle to do the Chromecast.<br /><br />We were viewing Netflix via Wii and that was ok, but with Chromecast we pull HD off of a DSL line.<br />Fantastic HD resolution and very, very little buffering.<br /><br />One downside, now need TV controller, DVD, etc and now another device for Chromecast.<br />Smart app would be a single device to control the TV, VCR, DVD and coffee pot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Keeps challenging you and its fun! Changes every time, not the same thing each time.  I really enjoy most of the games by King
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would have rated this 5 stars if the Chromecast would allow you stream local videos to your TV.  That would have made it a 5 star review.
1476727651|5.0|A great blend of old and new. Danny &#34;doc&#34; Torrence is back and shining bright, but so are all those scary things from the Overlook!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is incredible. It's narrated by Death, but has heart and soul. I saw an ad for a movie release of this book. After finishing this novel today, I can't see any way a movie can do this work justice. When I was young I read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\" It has stayed with me my whole life. I expect this exceptional novel to do the same. Deeply moving.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|So far I have yet to get this thing to work!<br /><br />1.  Mother's Sony flat panel, without network access - FAIL!<br />2.  Roku box on a CRT television with network access - FAIL!<br />3.  Sony BD player with network access - FAIL!<br /><br />In the end this device will cost you over $300 with either the purchase of a new television and/or the purchase of internet access.<br />I am LESS THEN IMPRESSED...
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Can't beat free and the story is rather interesting but the solution was too simple and actually very straightforward very unusual for Dr Who stories as I recall.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I am truly speechless after reading this book.  Liane must be the most gifted writer of all times!  I am serious.  Her book makes you feel...EVERYTHING!  Like everything you've ever wanted to say, think, or feel!  This book is brilliant, in such a profound simple way and I guarantee it will leave you feeling...Everything!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ruined my life! but its so fun! I love how you can connect with facebook and play with your friends! so fun!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This was an interesting twist on the Cinderella story.  And it ended differently than I thought it would.  It kept me interested throughout the whole book always wondering what was next.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It has been awhile since I couldn't put a book down.  Fortunately I was on vacation and had the time to read and read this one.
B005UG542S|5.0|We Love this movie! Clear, crisp picture and outstanding audio. We will be renting more movies from Amazon in the future.
B0056369RO|5.0|I don't know about the lyrics - in fact I really don't have a deep interest in them, but the upbeat tempo and rhythm coupled with the smooth vocals really makes this one a part of both my running and driving collection. I didn't notice much in the way of explicit lyrics, but again, I wasn't really that interested in the lyrics, so parents and the easily offended should check for reviews dealing with that topic.<br /><br />If you're looking for dark, brooding music, this isn't it. It's probably not music for a romantic evening, but if it involves burning calories or enlivening a boring drive, put this one on and crank up the volume!
B005SCSL56|5.0|She loved the book The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell. She thought it was filled with adventure and excitement. After reading the book she was begging to read the second book. I highly recommend this book. I was concerned that it would not be age appropriate. I was also concerned about the author and his liberal ideas. I am happy to say it was a great find and exceeded my expectations.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I have tended to bounce from one thing to the next. The One Thing has helped bring focus and clarity. I have a new tool to weed out those other things that are keeping me back!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable did not come with my Kindle.  I debated if I needed one. I then found out I can not check out ebooks from some of my favorite authors without the usb cable to transfer the data.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is a lot of fun and very addictive. Great through long marathon plays or a quick run. Highly recommend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it, go with me anywhere. Always connected with the social networking.go with me anywhere I this application in all my divices.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|You definitely need to add more seasons for prime members. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series. Got me hooked and now I can't get caught up with the current season without paying.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The book was awesome and I couldn't wait to finish it. It didn't talk about all the characters but still was as entertaining as ever
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Doesn't work at all. Just a radar and weird notifications. I tried but maybe no spirits here? Oh well it was free.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Pros: Everything.<br /><br />Cons: None.<br /><br />I only use this for playing mp3 files, so, it's all I can review it for.  It played my files perfectly and I have zero complaints.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Some said Iron Man 3 was confusing. Well as a person who is easily confused I LOVED It. It set up the future Iron Man movies to go in many directions!
0307730697|5.0|Amazing book!!!!!!!!  Adam brown was a man with problems .... Just like everybody else, he was human, but he was able to overcome his demons with the help of some good people and being pointed in the right direction. His drive for being the best SEAL he could be did the rest. He is the true definition of a hero..... Please spread the word about this book, his story deserves to be heard.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|They should never again allow him to direct a movie. I mean, come on. I love scifi as a general rule, but this was really atrocious. Do not waste your money.
B004JMY312|5.0|I love this movie. It was part of my childhood and always comes out during Halloween. It is great for kids and adults or kids who have grown into adults. I recommend it highly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it, and bought the next immediately after. Characters has real personalities, and the constant power struggle reminded me of game of thrones
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun game to play, especially if you don't have a lot of time. The play is fast and challenging but won't eat up a lot of time. With 3 levels of difficulty it will be challenging for quite a while. The ads only appear once a game, and are easily cleared. Recommend it for anyone who enjoys card games and wants something to occupy a little spare time here and there.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|the best game for kindle fire.  at first I thoughh it would be nothing but it not. I reccomend that you purchase this game.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A good follow up to the Shining! Found it difficult to put down.<br />Makes me want to retread the Shining.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There is hours of entertainment value with this game. And the levels are challenging to do. Good clean fun for the entire family.
B0043D2D64|5.0|Really fascinating and firghtening, well written - maybe a bit hard to believe this really could happen, but still a good story
B0084TWN9K|5.0|This book leaves me thinking about life, which is simple and repetitive. It made me think that I am not alone. Many people like me share the same stories in life.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Granted I have seen The Lord of the Rings before but I could not put down this book during the movie. I was so enchanted and overwhelmed by it that I simply have no truly accurate words for it. I have overwhelming joy and love at the end of this book. It is my sincere wish that the authors are aware of how powerful a book. That is all
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|With Facebook you cannot add a whole new aspect to your gameplay experience<br />Even without Facebook it's still a fun game for all ages
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a splendid storyteller like always. However, it's maybe too much a bit more of the same, somewhat predictable. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A fantastic read. It held my interest beginning to end. This book was well written, excellent character development and a lovely story. I look forward to reading other Zusak books.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|classic, but dated. kids weren't impressed, but maybe that's to be expected. video quality was fair to good with some blotches and grainy look.audio was great.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Angry birds is more of a game for kids.  For adults, it's just not that interesting or exciting.  Thanks for asking...
B007EC27QM|4.0|I like the memory feature where I can look back at the previous calculations like on a tape like calculator.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|In my life I have struggled socially and with<br />My mental health. I felt I could relate to Charlie on so many different levels, in the epilogue I cried. The best book I have ever read. I am going to recommend it to all my friends and my teacher. If I could talk to the author I would thank him for changing my life.
B004LUS390|3.0|This seems like a cool app. I just haven't played with it enough to know what it can do. My two-year-old isn't so impressed, but I'm excited to test it out.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is addicting, but I don't like how it uses your internet time...we should be allowed to purchase and play and not have to get on the internet each time.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Graphic and violent descriptions of a child that has been neglected........not my idea of a scary. The book is not a pleasant nor fun read. Too much of what King writes is just a mirror of what ails so much of our society......violence, drug use, alcoholism, child abuse.......yuk! I can get all of that by watching the news........sadly enough.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great dependable app. set it and forget it. Haven't had a missed alarm setting or time since I downloaded  this app.
B00ELOOYZI|1.0|I have no idea how to build a rocket... but I can't find directions to the game either. I guess I wasn't meant to be a rocket scientist.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you are stuck on a level for over 4 times playing it - it should give you more help - not help you have to pay for ...
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Makes you think about what you would do in similar circumstances.  None of us really knows until it happens to us.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|This book is too cute to be true! A great pleasure to read with your little ones! A must read for all Pusheen fans!
B00E7RZEI0|3.0|I love the background music--very calming. The game itself I haven't quite figured out yet, but it's worth looking into.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love it I play everyday and its awesome but it needs to be updated so I can explore more rooms and add friends
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Its a fun game when you have internet. when wifi isnt on the game force closes, so i cant play the game 3/4 of the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has a continuos challenge dont miss the clues learn the hints and dont stop till you are satisfied
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is as addictive as Farkle. I could spend a lot of money playing it but I mostly just play the four or five games every hour or so that you get for free. I am up to level 30  and they get harder as you go. One of the reasons being they want you to buy extra things in hopes you will win the next game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't this book down!  This is one of the most intriguing stories I've read in a long time. I am anxious to read more of her books.
B005HSL626|5.0|We love this game, we got it on x-box after everyone was telling us about it and then got it on the phones later, probably backwards from others but either way it is lots of fun to play.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like to play with my friends on line , we can track our advance and congratulate the others achievements
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So much emotion and voice. Recommend for people of all ages and genders. I was so sad when I saw there was no sequel!<br /><br />What did Charlie have that made him different than others in his grade? He clearly had a limited amount of friends in his grade and in general, but why? My friend told me he had post-tramatic stress after his aunt Hellen passed but I'm not entirely sure.<br /><br />Over all, it was an amazing book and I absolutely recommend it to everybody.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I liked this game. It was fun. I think it was a good one to play. Thank you for letting me play.
B003SI9WYG|4.0|This is a great movie and a great Halloween one! It is one of my favorites of Tim Burton's movies.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|Katy Perry had her taste of fluffy pop success with \\"Teenage Dream,\\" which was an insubstantial album, but loaded with inescapable pop hooks. It was a flirty, teasing album filled with songs of coming into your own (\\"Firework,\\" the title track) and goofy songs about being teenaged and irresponsible (\\"Last Friday Night\\"). There was also obvious filler (\\"E.T.\\"). but enough good material to compensate. Not so \\"Prism.\\" Every song is synth laden and seems to ditch the goofy fun of \\"Teenage Dream\\" for songs about empowerment and being more grown-up about life.<br /><br />Someone should have warned her. The girl who danced around with fruit bowls on her head is not the lady making \\"Prism.\\" Only \\"Roar,\\" \\"Walking On Air\\" and the lovely \\"By The Grace Of God\\" pull this CD out from the ranks of a total dud. Perry is still a gifted enough songwriter that even the filler is catchy, but unlike \\"Teenage Dream,\\" the filler is quickly forgettable. Perry is holding back here. Where is the personality? She sounds restrained, the kind of pop that plenty of other pop-tarts come up with on a regular basis, where \\"Teenage Dream\\" and her debut \\"One of The Boys\\" often came of as flirty and fiery, now she just sounds like she wants to be taken seriously. \\"Unconditionally\\" calls out for love that lasts forever, but not with any spark.<br /><br />The obligatory guest shot comes from Juicy J, who doesn't have the spike of Snoop Dog on the summer anthem \\"California Gurls.\\" \\"Dark Horse\\" again suffers from a lack of a sense of fun. Perry just isn't a gifted enough singer to convey the kind of emotional depth that \\"Prism\\" demands of the songs. \\"Roar\\" made for high expectations, but \\"Prism\\" just doesn't measure up. It's an average album from a woman who suggested that she may have had more to offer than platitudes and easy cliches. It just sounds like she's not trying very hard.

B001G7HKZ4|5.0|This movie was a surprise.  Funny, sweet and entertaining. We saw it on streaming, but like it enough to order a copy for friends.
0618918248|4.0|Husband is reading it and reads it aloud to me.  I am enjoying what he shares.  Funny and refreshing down here in the Bible Belt.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is lots of fun and will keep you going for hours. . I m glad I purchased the game
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|A hilarious book about an unusual man...<br /><br />The main character is a genetics professor who probably has Aspargar Syndrome, and goes about life in his very unique way - which is sometimes incongruent with others' idea of acceptable behavior. He shows us, however, that people don't all have to be the same to get along, and even love each other.<br /><br />The book reminded me of the T.V. series &#34;the Big Bang Theory&#34;.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie ever, and I've seen them all. The cast is fantastic, and Benedict Cumberbatch is mesmerizing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|fascinating idea<br />good twists,  leaves you wondering why you did not see the whole picture.  would choose more stories from this author
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  I am so happy that it is finally available for the Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad that candy crush saga is finally available for kindle. This is a fun and addictive game. A good time waster.
1476727651|3.0|When the greatest living author in the world attempts a sequel to his masterpiece (THE SHINING, written over 35 years earlier) even the most stalwart of King fans will enter with a mix of excitement and skepticism.<br /><br />To see Danny Torrance three decades later is exciting.  To find him heading down the same alcoholic path his father Jack had taken will depress --- but with Danny's ability to 'shine' there is not much else he can do to repress his visions.<br /><br />He is working in a hospice in New England where he helps the ailing pass on ---hence the nickname of Doctor Sleep.  He connects (literally) with a young girl named Abra who has the shine a lot stronger than he ever did and she is in deadly danger.  A group of energy vampires who call themselves the True Knot roam the American highways and byways seeking young people with the shine.  They literally suck their essence dry and the product they live off of they refer to as steam.<br /><br />Abra is the strongest shining kid these monsters have ever sensed and they will stop at nothing to devour her.  Dan must step in to team up with Abra for a showdown on the location of the former Overlook Hotel in Colorado against the evil True Knot.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I really wanted to like this book more than I did.  King's writing is always excellent.  The issue I have is that the new reality given to Danny T. is simply not very interesting (and a bit depressing).  The True Knot are also an unsettling bunch but not nearly as frightening as the evil beings/ghosts found in THE SHINING.  If only Dan Torrance's return to literature was a bit more ghostly and not as much run-of-the-mill YA vampire tale it would have made for a far better experience.
B005PZ87WI|5.0|Ok so I have been watching this series on here once in a while.  Dont have that kind of money.  The show is the greatest...well my number one forever show is \\"In The Heat Of The Night.\\"  But the cast and the storylines are great.  I would mark everyone of the episodes five star.  But that would take to long.  So I hope this review helps for the whole series!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I would recommend this game for people who r patient and want a challenge its pretty hard and gets harder the farther u get.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not the best in the series but readable. The point of view flip flopping is just annoying. I get why it was done but I found it distracting. The first Divergent was the best.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I almost never listened to the original album, because the audio quality was so terrible.  I remember how excited I was when it was originally released, because it was the first Rush album in years.  My excitement quickly turned to disappointment.  The audio level was cranked up to 11, and there was absolutely no dynamic to the sound.  Everything sounded muddy and compressed, and there was obvious audio clipping.<br />The remixed version is so much better in every way.  The dynamic sound that I expect from a Rush album is there now.  The sound is clean, with no clipping or popping.  The remix is so much better, it's like a completely different album.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game that is somewhat challenging but hate the fact that I A Ps keep popping up. Just charge a price for the game upfront.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Provides hours of fun and increases in difficulty as you gain experience.  Definitely fun and feels great as you see yourself improving.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book. Very interesting. It had me pulled in from the first page!! I definitely recommend to other to read!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I was surprised that some did not give this CD a good review.  KT's newest CD is yes extremely extremely mellow but it is a beautiful listen and is perfect for those types of days.  No this is not a CD to get pumped up or run a 5k, but when you are at your desk marking papers or just want to chill out, its great.  I am sure her next CD will be much more fast paced, but this was a great change of pace and is a great listen.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Loved it. Great action. Sorry line is amazing. Long movie, but enjoyed every moment. I'm now a start trek fan. ;)
0312427999|5.0|If you read no other book in your life in order to attempt to understand what's happening in the crazy world around you, this is it.  Five stars are not enough.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The only bad thing about trilogy's is the end of the third book. I enjoyed all three books and will look for more from Veronica Roth
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love growing my village and feeding my animals. Playing the Scrat game is really fun too. Good game for a small distraction in a busy day.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|A rather poor story line with gratuitous action scenes.  It had few if any of the classic StarTrek features.  Thumbs down.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So much corruption, so much deceit...juicy!<br />I can't wait to see what's next<br />I can't wait to see the show
B005K2XM94|5.0|Bought for my son for his Kindle.  He loves it.  Velcro closure.  It slides right in there and protects it.<br />Great envelope sleeve.
B00DMK6WN4|4.0|not quite as good as the original, but pretty darn good never the less . the animation just gets better and better, the story was fine too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Compact design hiding perfectly behind the TV.  It's very easy to setup even I live in Canada.  For $35, you can't ask for anymore.
1476727651|4.0|good to catch up with Dan, Stephen gave him work to do and his problems humanized him. little girl was a good character. I adored Danny in The Shining and I didn't adore the girl in this story, but she was a good character. villains were not as powerful as I prefer villains to be, seemed more a hybrid between psychopaths and ordinary people, with a touch of supernatural abilities - I don't think Stephen saw them as monsters so it was hard for me to see them that way. though they murdered children, most of that was done off story. I think a movie would be able to boost their evilness, which I think would be a good thing. Stephen King is an amazing storyteller, writer, one of my all time favorites. 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4 (as the rating system doesn't allow for fractions).<br />P.S. I'm guessing that now Mr. King is middle age and more knowledgeable about himself, other people and life, that he doesn't write so much black and white, good and evil, right and wrong. He always was careful in that way, but as he's gotten older and learned more, he, in my opinion, tends to mute the edges of the heros and the villains, so the hero isn't entirely heroic and the villains aren't entirely evil. This makes his characters more relatable but it also makes it harder to get behind them 100%, but overall, I'd read whatever Stephen King chose to write because his work is so outstanding I can always find something interesting or entertaining in his writing. The man knows how to tell a story, lucky for us. Thanks Stephen.<br />P.S.S. Thought of one criticism: calling women characters the \\"b\\" word. I consider it sexist. When you have male villains no other characters usually going round in the story calling them bastard or d*ck or pr*ck. I don't go around in my life thinking of myself or other women in this sexist/derogatory way. Even when a woman is rude to me I don't mentally insult her in that way. Male villains are not so abused, female villains shouldn't be either. And of course, the girl hero shouldn't be called that, though considering the villain has zero respect for humans, that she referred to Abra thusly makes some sense. As a woman in a largely mysogonistic world, don't want my art taking the same tact. When I think of great and terrible male villains, like Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, that mass murderer was too terrifying to be referred to as a bastard. A female villain should be so much on her game and so outclass most other characters that b*tch shouldn't even occur to characters; she should be so far beyond that insult, she should be outstanding in her evil, on another level, like a demi god. When you think of Dracula you don't think of him as a bastard, that word is far too mild to encompass the evil he does. I want a woman villain so awful that the word b*tch does not apply, a woman villain so scary as to inspire nightmares, like the Overlook did. So in this story, I didn't care for the use of the word when referring to the villain and the heroine.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, addictive. Hard to put it down. I stay up too late at night playing this game. I would recommend it.
B00FPGV3RS|5.0|very good movie with a great concept.  the action scenes were funny as well as fun, but the cgi was stellar.  the characters were excellent and fun to watch.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|In the present day world where slave owners and their mentality are in the ascendency, the theme of this movie was excellent! I don't remember ever feeling as good while watching a movie as  when the German bounty hunter shoots Leonardo! Bravo!<br />A bit too much violence for my taste, but I didn't mind it when it was visited on that cracker.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Use adobe for multiple reasons. But most directions and patterns are done in PDF.  Also use this product at work for forms.
B00AEBB932|5.0|He's an older gent, and loves westerns, and had mentioned that he remembered seeing this movie with Alan Ladd many years ago.  I ordered it for him, and he loves it!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Good movie: action, good story, humor. Not sure it should be just PG. PG-13 is probably more -it's a little scary in spots for little people! :-)
B00AALX5SI|1.0|My wife watched this and I got the email asking for the review. One star. Would not recommend for anything other than enhanced interrogation technique.
B009RH973I|1.0|bought it for HD7 and it is to large for the device.  Doesn't even snap into place.  Would not buy this again.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I was very disappointed in book compared to other Lee Child<br /> Books about Jack Teacher.  I found that various plots were too dragged out and boring
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you really like playing games once you get to a level that's difficult you won't want to stop playing. It will draw you back again and again.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Enjoy the detailed descriptions of the characters and locations, sights, smells as if I am there. This series will be a definite reread in my library.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it on my computer and my Iphone for saving information, recipes and directions and patterns.  Would recommend it if you are into saving information without printing it out immediately.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I like that the book is written in different point of views<br />I like the way the author wrote the book because I feel like the characters are actually talking to me.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Music wise cool. The fun part is when want beat and establish and record and try to beat your score or your friends score. Skill wise prove yourself to be the best and focus on the hills and judge at the right time when to stop. Its old school game at its best.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun, fast paced game, and still easy enough for kids. The short 1minute game makes taking turns easy for my kids and this is one game they can play on their own.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|i like the product with its limitations.<br />i allows to cast Google chrome tab or Netflix or YouTube<br />It worked for 20 days both times.<br />I paused the casting for 10 minutes both times and tried to use it. The stick failed, RESET WILL NOT HELP. I tried the reset. The stick will not boot up again<br />Thanks to Amazon for return policies. For the same reason I am a frequent user of Amazon. i can order a product and with in limits the Amazon takes care of return or various issues with the product.<br /><br />Failure of two stick in a row does not make sense.<br /><br />Has any one experienced similar issues?
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I realize this is a prequel and maybe it's because I watched the original TV show but I have trouble with movies whose actors seem like children playing adult parts.  This may make sense for the audience they're aiming for, but seeing someone who looks like a college freshman in charge of a star ship is not believable.  Spock, who is supposed to be enigmatic and stoic, looks like the Little Rascals' version of Moe Howard.  The only one here with any gravitas is the bad guy.<br /><br />Other than that, the story was good, well paced, usual great effects.  It's nice to have a little humor which is absent from most mega-science fiction.  I guess if you're young enough that these actors look like they could be in positions of power and command, it makes sense.
B0011ZWH2W|5.0|A great album. After &#34;Them&#34; I had to see how the story turned out. The music is amazing. The songs are very complex musically and as always King impresses with his vocal range. I highly recommend this album and it will be listened too quite often
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has so much depth to it.  Amazing read.  If you enjoy this book, then you should get Ender's Shadow too.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not my favorite Stephen King novel but it still had all the elements that makes it a great novel. Good character development and plot lines. I think I would have liked the book better if there was less from the perspective of Rose the Hat and have the reader discover the things about the true knot more through Dan and Abra. It seemed unnecessary and took away some of the suspense and intrigue I think it could have had. The story was great and had everything I wanted after finishing the shining. The shining was definitely scarier and left more of a lasting creepiness when the book was done. This was more just a good story. The Long Walk, Firestarter, 11/22/63 all much better and more complex. Worth reading and buying just not the best
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|I love this app just kidding it deserves to flipping die in a hole and never ever be seen again. me no likey dis apppp
055358202X|4.0|Tale continues but too many new characters and ignors what is happening to so many characters we want to know about.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Charlie is the only reason to watch this. The story is too abbreviated and the action is lacking if that was the focus.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app if your going to study His word. I love the audio book feature, it's really handy when your on the go.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book, very fast read, just disappointed that Charlie Hunnam isn't playing Christian Grey, in the movie. Not sure if I will see it now.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I love a good story! This one is great. I would sure like  to know what's next for Jake and Carla in Ford County along with all of the other residents. Does Lucien ever get his act together? The issues of race are always handled beautifully with good and bad on both sides of the color line.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was a good game only too short. I would reccomend it as a great casual game. It holds your attention and the mini- games
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie sync's perfectly with the book to bring this story about love to life. Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen, Gary Ross's vision creates a visual world that is both hypnotic and horrifying. I have watched this movie more times than I care to admit to yet I keep continue to be fascinated by it. As a fan of both science fiction and dystopian future genre's, for me, this movie ranks with the all time greats. Even thought the move is over 2 hours long the pacing keeps it moving so that there is never a dull moment or feels as if it is dragging. While some have expressed disappointment with the use of shaky cam I feel it was perfect for this movie. I can only hope the remaining 3 movies in the franchise are equal to the groundwork this film has laid.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book, very fast read, just disappointed that Charlie Hunnam isn't playing Christian Grey, in the movie. Not sure if I will see it now.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A very addictive game. It is hard to put down some time. But it helps to pass the time when riding in the car.
B008RVAAPE|4.0|Well researched historical facts about the English Archers and the longbow. Also very interesting about the follow up of the construction of the arches in the churches and the various problems encountered.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very happy to be able to join the addiction of the Crush!<br />Now I know what all the crave was about.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book, very fast read, just disappointed that Charlie Hunnam isn't playing Christian Grey, in the movie. Not sure if I will see it now.
B00F91FRTO|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing Sophia Coppola's new movie about a real-life teenage heist ring set in glitzy Hollywood, but in the first 30min I felt irritated and insulted from the superficiality of the characters and their motives.  It becomes a shallow, skim-the-surface pathetic rendition of a group of no-name teens wanting to live out their celebrity idol's fashion and glamour lifestyle by burglarizing and partying in their homes.  It becomes very repetitive - need to go shopping, break into house(insert dumb party girl celeb name here: Paris/Audrina/Rachel/Lindsay(don't they ever lock there doors?) steal clothes, jewelry, money and drugs, go to a nightclub(how old are they!) dance, drink and do drugs!  Over and over again.  Do they ever go to school?  Where are their parents? Oh yeah, some are just as messed up as their kids!  Their brazen, materialistic and self-centered personalities are supposedly caused by their focus on reality shows and social media saturation!!!???!!!  Really, Sophia?  No backbone or semblance of character development or was this movie meant to be a mirror reflection on its subjects: empty, hollow and one dimensional wannabe rich kids emulating flashy, shallow and no-talented celebs?  If so, then she nailed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie, now I can see the movie! Then it's the next book as well!!!!!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I've listened to all the outlander books on audio and now enjoying them again by reading them.  Think maybe this one is my favorite.  Not to say that they are not all five star entertainment, they are definitely.  I find it so difficult to put down one of Diana's books once I've begun.  She paints such vivid pictures in your mind.  But start with book 1.  Can't wait for Starz to begin the series.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is addictive and has interesting twists.  The wait times, asking you to contact friends, or purchase the next level is a pain.
B0000DJZAH|4.0|I'm  sure most have heard this album numerous times.  I finally got this for the SACD layers, and I enjoy the remix in 5.1.  Haven't listened to too much of the stereo SACD layer, but its a noticable improvement over the last remaster. They sure know how to sucker us in for buying this over and over. But its worth the money. I did get mine from a different vendor here and I returned however because itwas missing the booklet insert. A bit annoying for something this expensive. Will replace it again, but I won't it from &#34;Fullfillment&#34; and may justget the DVD-Audio as it's cheaper.
B002MRROKI|5.0|I love this band!! So excited that I now own this piece of history. I'll be watching this again and again
B00C7607BC|5.0|Love this movie since the first I saw it with my daughter. Happy that it's now on Blu-ray and able to enjoy with a clear HD picture & sound. One of Disney best movie for the family.
1484021851|3.0|First of all, I really do like this book, it's full of insightful information.  HOWEVER, the Table of Contents is a train wreck, and a couple of chapters don't even exist.  I spent the better part of an hour sorting this mess out.  This is my 3rd copy of the book from Amazon and all had the same problems.  So I decided to just keep this copy and fix the problems myself.<br /><br />Further problems include repeated chapter headings, take Introduction, which reads &#34;Success Principles for TED Talks&#34;, on page 3.  Then the same title is repeated again on page 11.  The text is not repeated, just the heading.<br /><br />Chapter 2, titled &#34;Find Your Core Message&#34; does not exist on page 11 (as stated in the Table of Contents), or anywhere else in the book.<br /><br />Chapter 10, titled &#34;Creating the WOW Moment&#34; is repeated again with different text on pages 93 and 103.  Again, the text that IS different, it's not that they simply repeated a chapter, that would be the book binder's fault.  The author wrote two seperate chapters and used the same title.  The ToC reads that this chapter is on page 77, it's not.  As stated above it's on pages 93 and 103.<br /><br />Chapter ? titled &#34;Using Analogies, Metaphors and Similies&#34; does not have a chapter number or page number.  It's on page 109.<br /><br />None of the page numbers in the ToC match the chapter numbers.  Here's an example:<br /><br />Chapter 5: ToC page number reads 24, it should be 29.<br />Chapter 6: 45 should be 55.<br />Chapter 7: 57 should be 69.<br />Chapter 8: 65 should be 78.<br />Chapter 9: 71 should be 85.<br />Chapter 10: 77 should be 93 & 103.<br />Chapter 11: 81 should be 99.<br />Chapter 12: 85 (chapter doesn't exist anywhere in book).<br />Chapter 13: 87 should be 105.<br />Chapter 14: 91 should be 115.<br />Chapter 15: 97 should be 123.<br />Chapter 16: 103 should be 131.<br />Chapter 17: 109 should be 137.<br />Chapter 18: 113 should be 143.<br />Chapter 19: 117 should be 149.<br />Chapter 20: 127 should be 155.<br />Chapter 21: 133 should be 163.<br />Chapter 22: 135 should be 167.<br />Chapter 23: 141 should be 175.<br />Chapter 24: 149 should be 185.<br />Chapter 25: 153 should be 189.<br /><br />In closing it appears that reading the book from cover to cover would be your best bet, just don't try to look anything specific up using the Table of Contents.  There is no index, that's probably a good thing since the publisher, editor, author and bookbinder missed the boat on this one.
B00F91H15W|4.0|This movie is a very interesting and entertaining car crash in slow motion. If you like Paris Hilton, you would enjoy this movie as it showcases her house.

B00881VLCE|4.0|This is a great way to relax and wind down after work. The pictures are beautiful. It sometimes freezes and I lost some of the puzzle packs when I updated. Otherwise it's a great app.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I thought it was far better than Elementary . I am now a fan and look forward to the next series
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is well designed and fun to play. The puzzles are not too hard yet challenging. I also enjoy the pictures and like watching the pieces get revealed.
075669812X|4.0|Bought it for my 8 year old son. A must have for a die-hard Ninjago fan! Comes with a free green ninja.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It is as fantastic as a great dream, full off wonder and surprise. It is fantastic like grand adventures are. Utterly luscious and enjoyable.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I have always liked King's books.  I enjoyed reading this follow-up novel to The Shining, too.  There was an especially heart-warming &#34;redemption&#34; scene towards the end that actually made me tear up a little.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS game is definitely worth it best game you can get your hands on you can build anything you want best game you can spend your $!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I loved this book. It gets into detail about the creation of the Spartans and the destruction of Reach at the hands of the Covenant. Unfortunately it contradicts Halo: Reach the game, but it's a great book nonetheless.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I used Amazon instant video to stream The Christmas special episode. For some reason this episode wasn't included in the blue-ray dvd of season 2.  I'm glad I was able to get it through instant video! It was the best episode yet!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I downloaded it cud I was tired of hearing about it then I played it.epic graphics. colorful. now I know why my family loves it<br />I'm addicted to the game!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|This game is amazing the only thing I don't like about it is you have to pay real money for the best upgrades but other than that it's a sick game
B009KCUX3S|2.0|I can't comment on the book content, it seems to be very good. But the kindle version makes a difficult read impossible. You must constantly move back and forth between pages because the sample code spans page breaks. You are lucky if you can get a complete sample, test, or even idea on one page. Checking code for mistakes, which is done often in this book, is so irritating that I have given up. This is the last ebook I will purchase. HEY AMAZON ever hear of the SCROLL function.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|While I like the idea of seeing how each region and countries handle the zombie apocalypse, there isn't a lot of depth to any story or any one character. Great of you like to read a little every night, you could read one interview each night and not feel too compelled to keep reading/to find out what happens next.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Another great movie! This one was just as good as the first one if not better!  The actors are perfect for this roll. I think they cast the actors perfect! I really think this sss another great movie!
B0002DB52M|4.0|Decent movie. but lack of scenery really turned me off. It looks like a HS play except the acting is actually good.
B003XDUCIG|4.0|Votive and an aruhor with proper expectations from the reader are rare enough. This is the first cookbook that spoke to me.
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|Way to complicated. Although if it were easier to use , I'm sure it would be a great app to have if you like editing pictures. It would take me way too long to learn it and I really don't have that the time on my hands I like to edit pictures however I don't want to learn a new profession to do it. I did spend the money on this application so I might drop off your as a grandmother however I was disappointed
1476747016|5.0|good quality book, hilarious comics of the cat and its pals, great for a good laugh and a lot of similarities to cats in real life
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Enjoyed all the characters. This book made me laugh, cry and smile. Looking forward to more books like this from her.
B000JMKNV0|1.0|The original four Kenzie and Gennaro books are awesome.  This one, however, sucked me in and then spit in my face with a very disappointing ending.  My advice to someone who is contemplating reading it is don't waste your time.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|All of you are right this is the best game it should be the game of the year except it freezes
0385523394|3.0|Have enjoyed reading this so far, have not finished it yet! But I'm going to get back to reading when my schedule get a little slower and I have a little more time!! Thanks Donna B
B005PK553C|5.0|Very well done.  Holds your attention through the entire series .  You will be on the edge of your seat and checking over your shoulder wondering if someone is watching you .
B009LDCZDC|4.0|Claire Danes' character does too much huffing and puffing, but other than that I am totally hooked.  Her character is very intuitive.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Graphics are very good the game runs smoothly.I am surprised this is on kindle for knowing most Apple phones apps are not on kindle and this gets me motivated to go in the forest and do this!
B00G8P27PM|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie. My wife and I enjoyed it. My little girl was interested but she fell asleep. Only 15 months and it was her bedtime. I love all the Disney pixar movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!! I WILL DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK AGAIN!!!!!!! I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE LIKES<br />IT AS MUCH AS I DID!!!!!!
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a series that has intelligent content. It is well written and brilliantly acted. I highly recommend this series.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|I find the kids to be too mean..I understand that it is part of the story but sometimes I find myself explaining to my kids how mean it is and not cool to be mean.  The kids love the movie.
B00G32OER4|4.0|It was better than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed it and it gave me a good scare.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|an amazing mp3 that lets me put my music in the cloud player and this is something that I love. it is secure and when I want to download a mp3 to cd's simply amazing as I said before.
B005SJINTS|5.0|This performance is my idea of a triumph, although there have to be some reservations about the way Leontyne Price handles the heroine’s role. The recording, from 1977 originally, can be praised without any reservation, and I find the booklet perfectly adequate. It does not contain the libretto in full, but it lists the heads of the successive numbers and tells us who is taking part in each. There is also a very good summary of the plot, which is a simple one, and these two features together give me as much detail as I need or want. What I really, really want is the glorious music, and that is given to me as I like it.<br /><br />Those critics may be right who find Price not on her best form, but I incline to a more sympathetic view that it is more a matter of the interpretation (whether hers or Levine’s or a bit of both)applied to the character of Leonora. This Leonora is a gentle creature, unlike certain other Leonoras e.g. in Fidelio. It could well be that Price did not wish, or was not advised, to be unduly assertive. That would certainly be understandable, but it might have been a little unwise all the same. The character of Leonora is central to the plot, but in fact she gets surprisingly little to sing. On the second disc, which is the longest of the three, she takes part in a short number just after the start which she has to share with three monks, and then she is not heard again until the very end of the opera. An interpretation of the part that inclines to the demure side risks letting Domingo and Milnes as Alvaro and Carlo out-sing her and out-act her, which is dangerously near to what happens. A good rule in Verdi is probably – whenever you are in doubt how to go about such-and-such a part always opt for hyperbole. That is just the nature of Verdi’s style.<br /><br />There is one other female role of any significance, and that is the fortune-teller Preziosilla. Cossotto deals with this very well, but it is manifestly a part that is only there to allow for another female voice in an opera that is exceptionally dominated by male singers. The men have to sing well in that case, and in the event they sing superbly. Of the ‘minor’ parts I might single out Giaiotti as the abbot, but they are all good. However everything revolves round the tenor/baritone lead parts of Alvaro and Carlo, and we have two great singers in superlative voice here. The challenge is a familiar one in Verdi, and one that Verdi’s great admirer Bernard Shaw pointed up in Verdi’s own long lifetime. Simply, Verdi has a strong preference for the upper fifth of the voice. This is what makes such a predominance of male timbre tolerable, but it takes its toll on the human vocal chords when the style is as strenuous as Verdi’s is. I suppose in that case we should include congratulations to modern voice trainers and coaches for helping their mighty students in the way they manifestly must have done. Leontyne Price has come off next best through her seeming restraint, but the sound of Domingo and Milnes, separately and together, is something to live for. Glancing down the numbers in Act III I see about half an hour’s uninterrupted singing for them, mostly at full volume. They sound as if they loved it, but I bet even they were relieved at not having to fight a duel while they were about it, as they would have had to do on stage.<br /><br />There is no way that I could award this set less than the full five stars. If I have given any impression that even Price is less than good, let me take this opportunity to say that I meant nothing of the kind. A great Verdi rendering  is like taking a bath in melody, and as someone once said Verdi’s music has power with a capital ‘POW!’ This is a musical experience I would not have wanted to miss.allow for another female voice in an opera that is exceptionally dominated by male singers.

B00FJTYDKK|4.0|What a cute movie!! I was snickering throughout the entire film. Great movie for kids and good one for adults also.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent. I personally do not have a kindle tablet, so its great that kindle has a pc format that I can download a ebook and look at and read on my pc.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|My favorite books are the ones that show me things I was never aware of before, while holding my interest with great writing. This one is a winner on all counts. I was sorry when it ended.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Lovely soundtrack. Enjoyed as much as the movie. Strongly recommended for everyone who enjoys QT movies and westerns and good tunes.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|I could hardly find this movie in any big theaters near me. I will definitely buy this DVD. I hope the proceeds got to education of how horrible business like Sea World/Land and any place like these are for all sea animals.  This is the most powerful and eye opening documentary of this kind I've seen in the last 5 years. I'm glad the former trainers participated in this film and woke up to the insanity. But as stated, &#34;the humans/trainers were the most well-trained animal in this scenario.&#34;  The accepted so much and were so blind to obvious abuses. I'm sure there were people outside the industry who were speaking of the cruelty to animals and danger of Orcas in captivity way back when, so these trainers were definitely either brainwashed or preconditioned by the general mis-education and tactics in society.  What kinds of humans follow orders and do what their told even in the face of obvious abuse of some other being and eminent endangerment to themselves, but the very well trained ones.<br /><br />.
B0073COMUW|5.0|I'm loving this bulb. I purchased this and the 7W A19 also made by light EVER to compare them and both produce a beautiful white light that doesn't shock my eyes when I turn them on the way the CFL lights we had before did. The power savings are honestly negligible when switching from CFL, but the bulb runs cool and the lighting really is a nice white light like daylight. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|For old times sake, I liked the book (got a little bored as the end approached) still fun to read as always.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Loved the down to earth tone when talking about  some of the greatest people on earth. If you like to know what makes people jump higher than the average Joe, or why lighting strikes every second and why no one will ever see or hear this, the universe has its hero's. To the businessmen or lawyers to inventors and or actors, this book helps bring people to a common thread, and that is to become the best in what ever you do, You will never know where it will take you. I have this book because I know some people of industry that you would never believe the amount of success they have had, one of my personnel theories is to mingle with these people and see how they think, they are no different than you or anyone else. The real true thing I see is that they are open to all sorts of ideas and with some of there own they&#34; ACT &#34;on it, and bet the farm on it. They believe in themselves they do not look at the failure aspect, they see it as a learning curve...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book. An epic tale of the human race in great peril, in the face of annihilation. A story of a boy who saved the human race…
B002KGEORM|5.0|Love this show, this season does a great job continuing where the other season left off.once you watch  you're hooked.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish it was free on my phone. I don't think if it's gonna be free other platforms are able to charge.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a fun game to play. It is addictive. I just can't put it down except when I run out of lives.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The show grabs you, and holds you. I haven't stopped watching and now I'm on season 4, and it's only getting better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging game. Especially in achieving a perfect star. There is a rule of thumb if you can figure it out.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|This song is super sexy and evokes plenty of loving emotions when played... John Legend is an amazingly talented musician!!
0399213015|3.0|The story is great, but I wish we saw the description where it says mini. It was our fault, but disappointing opening the package to find such a small book that a child will most likely destroy. Ended up reordering the same book but larger.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is unique in that it has a great story line, coupled with horror/suspense elements that involve Zombies, what's not to love about that? The actors are fantastic and the visual effects are on a whole new level, glad it got picked up for a 5th season.
B008B68IV8|5.0|My boyfriend's daughter just loves Monster High, and her favorite set so far are the Travel (Scaris) set. She almost has the complete set, so the basic travel are nice and cheaper to finish her set.
B008K8U13K|5.0|well how do I start this oh yeah the first time I played it I loved it but now I cant get on it what's my problem
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Excellent second portion of the triology of Lord of the Rings but should be seen in the correct sequence rather than alone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I cannot lie. I loved these books. They were not even near being as much of a filthy romance novel as I expected from everything I heard. But I enjoyed the read. They were fun enough to keep you reading and intrigued. My favorite was the third book, of course.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play it in all my spare time. I have it on my iPhone and also on my kindle fire.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|spoiler......<br />this book really sucked because of the language , the no no emotion robots into this book [tris tobias e.t.c.]<br />tris's budding reltaionship with tobias is what gaveme a little hope and a glimpse of the future . i wish i never read this book for my life , i hate these series so much that i cant even look at them since i suggested this to all my friends but for you i would say just stop at the second book.....<br />the worst part in this is the part where they kill off tris . she really did not deserve it and poor tobias this book really took away his four character his tough but gentle side she really took the real four out ........ &#34;i scream&#34;? the real four NEVER screams.. And he and tris belong.. if they were to die they should die together happy. well to the point do noy buy this stickin book it stinks and i just hate they series and its true that i loved the first 2books but never again and i used to reread the first 2 until this book came out  i hazte this book ugh..... its been two days since i read it and its stuck in my mind this tragic story i am going back to reread my beloved percy jackson series and stare at cute pics of logan lerman and reread the hunger games series and then start reading the mortal instruments series (no these books are good) ;&#62;
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Bastille's sound is distinctive.  &#34;Laura Palmer&#34; really stood out on the modern rock station I listen to -- the drums especially.  So far I love it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Tis is Stephen King at his best. If you loved The Shining, you're going to flip over Doctor Sleep. If you were wondering what ever happened to Danny Torrance from the Shining, you MUST get your hands on this book. I'm not going to say more -- just do it!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Very disappointed in this book. I was waiting for something more to happen, something different then just the fighting and uprisings. It was just a lot of the same thing over and over. The ending was also very disappointing.
0525478817|5.0|What a great novel. I didn't know that this was a book about cancer. It was funny, because I had just finished my own chemotherapy treatment when I was reading this. It is a well-written book, with very real emotions and teenage angst. Although it is classified as a &#34;young adult&#34; novel (which I am not, being 36 years old), it is equally entertaining and enjoyable for the more mature reader. An easy read, and I would highly recommend this. I have heard that this was to be made into a movie.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|I loved this Colleen Hoover book. I believe that this was her debut book and I think probably the best book of hers I have read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset. I've had it about 6 months now.  It is not prefect. The sound is OKAY at best and battery doesn't seem to last very long for me after having it for 6 months. I can't stand near a microwave when it is running or it cuts into the sound (my desk is near the kitchen in my tiny apartment).  But I still love it. The sound thing I can deal with, being able to use the headphones while plugged in or wireless is fantastic, the battery is rarely an issue. I just run away from the microwave when I start it... I've dropped them a few times and they are fine. I wear them when my hair is still wet and they are still fine. They weren't super expensive. But they do everything I wanted them to do.  I often wear them leaving my apartment and have to return to put them down.  Edit: Had for years. Still like it. Bought a second one for work. My old one now sometimes fuzzes out or screeches in my ear on occasion. It HURTS. But.... I still love this headset.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't understand why it took so long for this game to be available for Kindle Fire but I'm glad it's finally here. This game is simply addictive and fun, solving the puzzles, getting to the next level, beating out friends scores. Yeah its the best. Amazon more King games please!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay so I confess, I have read this twice already and still laughed just as hard as the first time. Written from a male's POV but really believable. This book still manages to be romantic but has lots of funny moments in it too. You will love it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Totally hooked.  Can't wait to see season 3.  If you have seen the first season, you know what I' talking about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a rollercoaster coaster of a ride!  Just when you think that you got it figured out, the plot totally changes. You don't see the end coming.  It's a must read.  I will be starting book three right away.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love it..! Every episode is action packed...I can't wait to see the next one. ...it is my favorite show on here!
B00000I9MK|5.0|I always want to love the other  Belle and Sebastian albums as much as Tiger Milk, and some single songs approach the overall quality of their masterpiece, but generally I find the later albums never measure up. There is a melancholy, touching quality to the music that lingers with the listener even beyond the melodies you catch yourself humming days after you last listened to it. Bands often have trouble duplicating the critical and artistic success of their debut albums even though they grow as musicians and lyricists. There's a magic that often happens with that first release that is alive with an energy that ebbs with future releases. That's how I feel about Tiger Milk. I love it, and I will keep buying their other albums for the near misses and the blind hope they'll eventually equal or surpass this amazing album.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's always fun to read an old classic like Tom Sawyer!  It's easy to imagine all his antics and picture them taking place, especially after visiting Hanibal, MO.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Rick Riordan, keep writing! I just finished this book and I'm looking forward to the next one. A funny fact- in this book... Grover gets a date! Ha ha. Anyway this Quinch guy is Daedalus, and he kills himself to break the Labyrinth. The hellhound-a tame one- becomes Percy's. Ps the movie for \\"The Lighting Thief\\" is bad enough. Oh, and Poseidon says Percy is his favorite son.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Its a great app, I just hate that we have to wait to play a full song every 5 minutes.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This is a book that surprised me several times.  I must admit at times, the switching between present, past and future can get a bit confusing.  The narrative full of detailed descriptions and the skill of this author to increase my interest just when I was about to leave the book was key.  I liked the story overall, very much and the last quarter of the book I couldn't leave it for a second.  I switched from reading a couple of pages a day to looking forward to every chance I had to take the book back.<br />I recommend sticking with it till you get to the end. It is worth it!
B0090X4GLW|5.0|My Granddaughter wanted the CD and she loves it.  I don't know much about it, but she defiately does and enjoys it.
0345529057|5.0|I fell in love with the series on HBO, bought the books to see if what I see on the screen is close to the book and I wasn't disappointed.  I'm also somewhat of a history buff, the grandeur of a novel with so many characters, and some fantasy thrown in for good measure is really great both in the books and in the series.  It is very much like the War of the Roses, but Mr. Martin has gone beyond making our minds attach themselves to those characters, and seven kingdoms. It's a great ride!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Man I man. I'm not sure what to say. This girl is in for a lot of work and pain. I'm just not sure about maxon. He seems way different and I'm not sure if I like it.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|who doesn't like zeppelin one two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five six seven eight nine
B00DHRLK84|5.0|This movie is a nonstop thriller. Many moments of it are unexpected and will leave you thirsting for what's gonna happen next. It's not too gruesome and gory compared to many recent zombie based media, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The movie does a good job playing with your emotions and keeping your interest. Quite a unique movie and idea that I have yet to see in any other zombie movie, overall a great movie. It's even better in 3D as some scenes actually make good use of it!
0143118757|4.0|Easy to read book with good pointers that are mostly common sense, but it is helpful to have all those tips in one easy, cleanly structured place with clear examples.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun because you get to pick you own charter and get new high scores that's wy I thinck this app is amazing
006202406X|5.0|This was an an amazing and powerful conclusion to the trilogy. It was hard to read-- emotional, devastating, thought provoking, inspirational.  We all love very pure happy endings, but Roth has not written any of her books with a pure happy ending-- the power behind her messages and underlying connections are made stronger by the choices she made throughout the book , especially the ending. I hope readers who gave this 1or2 stars reflect a bit more and realize how well written this book is. Great job!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Love this movie. The idea is fun and it has many funny undertones. Of course the all star cast really made the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a fun game but when they have you get stuck on a level for months some people just quit, two weeks is long enough.  Why make some levels so hard it just discourages some and I have lost several friends who just quit
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Playing this game is fun kindle need to keep up with the rest of tablets when adding hot apps I was waiting for this.<br />Great Game!!!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book was hilarious and perfect. I was worried that it would be a re-hashing of older material, but it's a pretty good divide of the familiarly hilarious from the blog, and the new and also hilarious stories she's been holding out on us. I don't like using the same adjective repeatedly, but hilarious is the only adequate word.<br /><br />I pre-ordered it when it was announced and have been trying to forget about it since then because it was a birthday present to myself and I really wanted to be surprised. That didn't work, but I was still thrilled when it arrived. I read the whole thing unintentionally and now I'm trying to figure out how to give this to all of my friends for Christmas without them figuring out that I gave them all the same book.<br /><br />Check the blog out, read the classics listed on the sides--if you find them funny, this book will suit you. If you don't find them funny, I don't think you have the capacity to be amused and you should probably buy it anyway and leave it laying around to fool people into thinking you have a sense of humor. Blend in, my friend.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Story based on the greed of men and nations as they attempted to exploit the resources of the &#34;new world&#34;.  Reality check - life is not fair and justice does not always win. Acting was superb.
B00AG472DS|5.0|Not only is the movie amazing, the special features tell you everything you need to know about both the movie and the real events. I can never find good Zodiac Killer documentaries, and this just about covered everything.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love Lady Gaga -- she is just so talented, I would love to see her perform live... wouldn't you???

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A cleverly written tale of courage, fortitude, and underlying existentialism.  The COTW firmly squared it's place on my favorites list!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|A well written, captivating true story of a woman imprisoned. I felt like I lived the experience along with her; an experience not a lot of women have had. Brilliant.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Stupid concept !  This movie was in pieces that were not related to each other; and very difficult to keep up with in regard to any real plot !
B006LSZECO|1.0|What a waste of my money! All that reading for the worst ending to a book ever!! Don't read it!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Most long series of novels eventually become repetitive and stale, even really good ones like the Stephanie Plum series. The writer's faults eventually seem to become magnifed. Jack Reacher is growing old but this series isn't. Lee Child is really a master at weaving plots that keep the reader engaged, and creating charters that are worth getting to know. No writer, modern or in the past, is without faults. Lee Child is at the top of that list. His works will endure.

B001CTGQBK|4.0|Although the plot of this movie is very problematic, the movie itself is so culturally significant that every one should watch it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved this. I haven't read such a great soap opera in ages. I like the staccato style, the characters, and the great way the author weaves the tale.
B008Y7J91M|3.0|Very good performance by Frances O'Connor.  Plot moves a little slow at points.  The film apparently does not follow the book precisely but is certainly a worthwhile film to watch.

B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Honestly the best thing Ive ever seen. A truly great horror series. Would recomend to anyone disapointed by the American Horror series.
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|After listening to this for the past week, it has proven itself to be worthy contender for the best of the multiude of great release in Prog for '13. When the Kings arose from the ashes last year with the grand Banks of Eden, I was a bit leary-until I heard it and was won over immediately. The cohesion and skill of this great band was on fine display yet again. As great as that album is , it was a bit too comfortable with not alot of risks being taken. This album is the antithesis of that. All risk....and great reward! A darker view from the top of the Tower sets the tone on track ONE and that continues thru to the hopeful conclusion of the last 2 tracks. Really this is just one long track, broken in to smaller sections, with simillar themes running thru. Not quite a concept album, but almost. Themed, maybe? Anyways, its all brilliant on disc one. Disc two takes into some more trippy terriitory and this is where the great instrumentals reside. Yep-its all good here in the land of the kings! Not to be missed!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|To me, this is much better than TEMPLE RUN. I hope more games like this come out that are FREE too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|No spoilers here.<br />Gone Girl was a little hard to get into, but if you stick with it does really get good. I'm rating this five stars because of the story itself and the writing style. Such a great novel...enjoy!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an amazing app. I give it five stars the guns are what soldiers actually carried and the sound effects are pretty accurate... all in all a great app

0515142247|4.0|Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Jack Reacher just happens to be in Chicago and runs into an FBI agent just as she is snatched off the street by some mysterious bad guys.  She's the target of the kidnapping.  Besides being an FBI agent, she also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces.<br /><br />Talk about being in the right place at the right time.  Jack Reacher is kidnapped along with an FBI agent, and as a result, infiltrates a radical militia group and saves the day, thwarting the plans of the insane militia leader.  If you know Jack Reacher, you know that he overcomes impossible odds, outwits the cleverest foes, shoots like the best marksmen, and manages to hook up with the most beautiful women.  So it won't surprise you that he does all that in more in Die Trying.<br /><br />Even after reading only two Jack Reacher books and seeing the movie Jack Reacher, I am coming to see Lee Child's formula.  But just because something is formulaic doesn't mean it doesn't work.  Child puts together a somewhat implausible plot with Reacher's quite expertise and determination to create a page-turner.  The action is well-written, with lots of technical and strategic detail.  The Montana Militia theme seems sort of dated, even though this was just published in 1998.  Are those guys still around?  And does Child unfairly depict them as sociopathic megalomaniacs?  Well, it is fiction after all.<br /><br />Pick up Die Trying, or any Reacher novel for that matter, for a fun-to-read, action packed tough guy novel.  A guaranteed testosterone boost.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|i very good movie and  love to see it again wit familys and friends will love to see it again and again
B0083GQKQG|1.0|Terribly disjointed, and very slow to develop the story.  In the book the mother is genuinely perplexed about why her son is so unloving and distant.  The movie changes the focus:  it is the mother who is unloving and distant.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|i love it, i will see it again with family and friends. I will watch again and again and again.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Pretty cheeky and entertaining, although the falling over game is #%&(#$!!! to figure out how to work.  Play it a few times and then forget about it...come back after a while and it's fresh for a bit again.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|This is one of my favourite books! I was very gutted when I heard Darcy had been killed off but once I had read it you understand more why he needed to go. I love Bridget and can so connect with her and what she goes through as a mum.

0140564349|3.0|It was as you described it, however the postal carrier stuffed it in my mailbox so it was significantly creased in several spots. I enjoyed sharing the book with my friend but wished it would have more care in delivery.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator.  It's  simple  and easy to use for all my calculation needs, and it's free!  Love it! .Thanks.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|First and foremost, I must confess that I love the book. It is easily one of my all time favorite books. That being said, I was both ecstatic and horrified when I heard that they were making the movie. I had always imagined George Lucas to direct the film adaptation and when I heard that it was directed by someone I wasn't familiar with I was less than happy. In fact I was terrified that they were going to destroy my memories of the book. Luckily, they didn't. Yes, they tweaked parts of the story, and left out some information. However, surprisingly it didn't bother me. I was happy with the end result. It was clear that they tried to keep it as close to the story as possible. Yes, there are some things that I wish they had included in the movie. However, I understood why they didn't. That being said, I recommend that you actually read the book prior to seeing the movie. Is it essential? No! However, I believe that it will make it a lot easier to understand and appreciate the story and the actions of the characters. The book was wonderfully detailed and made you feel empathy for Ender and his teams. However, due to the length of the movie, that is something that they were unable to fully develop or focus on. Prior to seeing the movie, I read a few reviews by respected critics. Frankly, it was clear that most of them had never read the book, or they didn't bother to pay attention. This is one of those movies that are catered more towards adults. There are a lot of underlying messages and philosophical questions in this movie. If you do not pay attention, then you won't \\"get it\\". ***If you are expecting a comedy, romance, action/adventure story then you probably will not be satisfied. This movie is not \\"Twilight\\", \\"Star Trek\\", or \\"Die Hard\\". In short, I would definitely recommend watching this. I will gladly include it in my Christmas gift list this year.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a fun and adventurous story. I had remembered some of the main happenings but fun to review what led up to them.  I enjoyed it.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Not good for young hands ! Bends and gets dirty easily. I guess, in fairness, that's not really easily fixed..

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Honestly, I had a hard time in the beginning with her skipping to three different families/story lines, but it clicked pretty quickly.  This book kept me drawn in & ended with perfect resolution!
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|This new package is a must have for casual and avid fans of Clapton, if for no other reason than the extra tracks from rehearsals for the show.  Love hearing My Father's Eyes and The Circus...Town.  I hadn't seen the video in years, so it was nice to see it again.  The CD was so popular because it was filled with great blues and great originals.  Forget about Layla; as good as it, there are great tracks that you may not have heard. And for musicians, this was the album that launched a million acoustic blues sets.  It was that influential when it came out.
B008CRC506|5.0|I love this show so much and was happy to get it for a cheap price and I got it quickly.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|It took a few listens for &#34;New&#34; to grow on me, but it struck me from the 1st listen that at 71, McCartney is still putting an amazing amount of energy.  He's not just phoning it in.  Like &#34;Memory Almost Full&#34; and &#34;Chaos and Creation,&#34; &#34;New&#34; has some stellar pop/ rock tracks--&#34;Queenie Eye&#34; is just a tight rock-pop song with supposed digs at fame chasers (read Heather Mills); &#34;New&#34; is as catchy as they come, but the lyrics make the song interesting--lines like &#34;Don't look at me&#34; are intriguing for a man in the spotlight; The &#34;hidden tune&#34; is as strong as any of the songs on the album, a beautiful ballad; &#34;I Can Bet&#34;-70s disco made fresh.  There are plenty of songs here with weight to the lyrics.  &#34;On My Way to Work&#34; is a 1st person character who picks up trash and who notes that the girl in the magazine &#34;took off her clothes for the likes of me.&#34;  McCartney has written songs in the past where he looks &#34;at the average person,&#34; more like a zoo animal.  Here on &#34;New&#34; though, that average person is more developed, flawed, capable of receiving our human compassion.  It's these kinds of songs which make the album worth buying.
B00448SE4S|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies.  Good cast, Good direction.  I watch this again and again.  The ultimate slacker flick.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Amazon is a great story but Mr. Stone brings it to life and immerses you in the meeting rooms, warehouses, and board rooms. I felt like a fly on the wall.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I read the original about 15 years ago and I forgot how good a book this is (supposedly becoming an HBO series).  If yoiu have the original release, you don't really need this version, but if you haven't read the book, i recommend this version.  An American classic
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Don't even bother listening 2 the other ppl. It's not glitchy @ all. It works perfectly fine. Even if it does glitch, u can easily delete it from ur cloud and re install it. it's still gonna b free. If it costs $ in the future, it still will b free to re install. over all Minion Rush is a fun game. Download it for free today!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was suggested to me by a friend. Was a good read. A little dry and repetitive in some parts but overall a good book.
B00633PFQC|3.0|I like his thesis a lot - that are some things that cannot be quantified by dollars, and perhaps SHOULD not be quantified with dollars because to do so would compromise the quality of thing that's being sought in doing so in the first place.  I get that.  However, after the first few chapters, this book appears repetitive and thin - he doesn't ground his thesis deeply enough.  He makes the same simple point over and over, and doesn't seem to go beyond a simple observational perspective in most of the case studies.  I was hoping for (and expecting) and more substantial, intellectual work.  I did not find it.  I quit reading three-quarters of the way through because I hadn't learned anything new in the previous several chapters.  So, I like his thesis, I like his case studies, but his engagement with and handling of it all leaves a lot to be desired.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Because I love Susan Boyle. I got her Christmas CD last year and this one is even better. I have ordered moe for Christmas gifts.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great book.  Full of data-driven insights, case studies and conclusions; easy to read, but not slogany or shallow, and clear in its overall focus.  I use this book (and the little monograph addition that focuses on social sector businesses and nonprofits) for facilitating executive team and board retreats for various kinds of organizations.  It works really well - generates significant reflection, strong discussion and a meaningful learning experience.  Combined with the website materials at Collins' website, it's a great resource for any business (profit or nonprofit) that wants to go to the next level of success.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! Fun for all ages! So entertaining! Nothing bad about it! Everything is perfect! What's your high score?
0977326403|5.0|This is a great little book that is best understood in the context of the larger work &#34;Good to Great&#34; but can be read and understood well on its own.  I respect Colliins' candor in admitting that he learned from non-profit leaders that the insights he gleaned from his research in Good to Great didn't apply totally to nonprofits - and Collins' adjusted his thesis accordingly.  Most folks don't have the integrity to do this.  Anyway . . . .I've used this little book (and the larger one) in facilitating executive team and board retreats for nonprofits with strong success.  The ideas are data-driven, the case studies are illuminating, and the website materials that support this body of work offer great discussions questions, exercises, and diagnostics.  This is one of best organizational books I've read and used.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|always love the Star Trek Series and movies, but only had them on VHS. I could not pass up the price.
0762449314|5.0|It is so great but anything  from Dr  Who is so cool.  Love it and love the book too tells you a  lot about the the Dalek.
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|Just a fun movie, making a little fun of the Trekkie clubs and conventions, but it works.  Fun and entertaining even if you do not like Sci-Fi
B00E9P959O|5.0|I must say that I have a new appreciation of this disc after hearing it remixed.  It certainly brings out the songs more and shows it not to be the &#60; stellar album I thought it to be at first.  Don't get me wrong; it's Rush so it'll never be bad, but I didn't think it as good as I expected when it came out & I think some others felt the same way.  Hopefully, everyone else who thought that will give this one a listen & reevaluate it.
148252676X|1.0|Very unsatisfied with this product.<br /> The typo is so small you can barely read it.<br />Absolutely do not recommend this edition!
B00D3S1QD6|2.0|The prouduct was great at first but then it starting eating up so much memory so I was forced to delete it to conserve space.  Now with that said I am not very phone literate so the app did work as said I just had a hard time figureing it out.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This app is what software should be. It works with no glitches or down side. I love the big buttons. On my Kindle I can easily do 10 key entry without looking.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Was resistant to Daniel Craig as JB until Skyfall, then I never looked back and got Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.  Best since Sean Connery in my view and Casino Royale was a great beginning to a new JB.
B007EC27QM|1.0|What is good for a calculator app that has nice keys but lags big time?<br /><br />This app only stress in the UI  but when pressing any of the keys,  it lags as long as 1 or 2 seconds before it shows the number on the screen.<br /><br />Basically it's useless not to mention it's not free.<br /><br />There are lots of free calculator that is super responsive and yet give a nice UI.<br /><br />Stay away.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Great Zombie movie...but it is a Zombie movie.  So if you are looking for that genre with solid acting and a good script, this will do the trick.  Of course, add in all the modern special effects and its well worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!! it is awesome and being bored is never an option with this game. my whole family loves the game
0375842209|5.0|I began this book sitting in a park in Manhattan on a beautiful Fall day and it has haunted me ever since. Narrated by Death, it tells the story of Liesel Meminger and her life in World War II Germany. Markus Zusak does an amazing job of putting the reader into this horrible time when atrocious acts were being committed and yet I found myself rushing home from work to read some more. The book had so many elements, not only war, death, suffering and terror , it also had love, friendship, loyalty and humor. As a lifetime avid reader this wonderful book was recommended to me many times by others who loved it. I gladly join their ranks and will pass it on to another book thief.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is even more riveting than the others before it! The twist and turns the story takes will have you flipping page after page!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game experience. If you guys are thinking about getting it don't think do. I hope you guys that get this app. ENJOY!
006202406X|2.0|My advice is to stop reading after book 2 and just imagine your own ending.<br /><br />In sum, Allegiant is just plain disappointing. And here are some reasons why.<br /><br />1. I was so excited to read it and was expecting a story that read like its predecessors, which I think is a reasonable expectation. But this book is just so different compared to the first two. And it's not good. I'm surprised anyone involved in its development thought that this would be a successful third installment to the trilogy.<br /><br />2. It was poorly written. I was bored. It also seemed super rushed. Like the publishers pushed the first draft through release with little or no editing. More time was needed to develop a quality product.<br /><br />3. Unlike the first two books, this book is told in two perspectives: Tris and Tobais. It was not well done and it slowed down the pace of the book. It was also too confusing - Four's voice should have been distinctive from Tris' and it wasn't. You shouldn't have to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to remind yourself who's talking.<br /><br />4. Well established characters, including Tris, acted in ways that do not make any sense in relation to how we know them to be from the first two books.<br /><br />5. The new characters were not nearly developed enough. There wasn't enough substance behind any of them. The thing is that she told us enough about these people - how good or bad they are and even a little background - to suggest we were supposed to be drawn to or otherwise repulsed by them. But what she gave us wasn't enough.<br /><br />6. It was hard to keep liking even the characters that were developed in the previous books. Tris was okay, but even her likability suffered since half the book wasn't in her perspective. Four went from this strong, mysterious, sexy love interest to a confused, self-doubting, mess once we got in his head. I think one of the worst things about this book is that she changed/demystified/ruined Four. Any other character I liked in the first two books either wasn't featured nearly enough.<br /><br />7. Don't even get me started on the ending. Read some of the other reviews, because I totally concur.<br /><br />So can we call for a rewrite? An alternative ending? This was just not satisfying, and I liked the other two books too much to not forget about this one and read a proper conclusion. At the very least, the screenwriters are going to have to promise to take the third movie in a new direction if they want anyone to watch it... as long as the release of this book doesn't kill the movie franchise before it takes off.
B00555X8OA|1.0|If you just LOVE statistical analysis you will love this book. I found it bored me to teats. They take the obvious stuff--mainly why we choose to follow what we feel in our gut while ignoring what we know in our brain--and analyze it ad nauseam.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great game for creating your own land and keeping it in tact.<br />Use your imagination and have fun with it.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Loved every minute. It was very scary without all of the gore. Great story and great actors. If you enjoy suspense, you will love it!  I'm going to go buy the movie now.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|After reading Divergent and Insurgent, I was really anticipating the final chapter in the trilogy. However, Allegiant was a major let down. The book reads like it was written by a completely different author. Instead of having any real substance of a story, this book is about 70% talking, 25% teenage make-out sessions, and 5% of actual plot development. It seems like everything that happened in the first two books was for nothing. I understand that some books take a little while to set up events that will unfold, but I had a hard time trying to make myself finish reading this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome app good for all ages and when you turn the app of your still getting money and its fun and cool you should get it.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Item came quickly, accurate to description.  This is one of my favorite movies.  The deleted scenes are a lot of fun.  I recommend this seller
1933952806|5.0|A must have.  It is hard to put into words how much I appreciate this book.  Extremely well written.  Takes a very complicated camera operating system and dissects it piece by piece in a very orderly fashion.  The best part, Darrell&#34;s recommendations and reasoning after each learning set of adjustments, priceless.  Just buy it!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I got this DVD set as a gift for a friend. It arrived at her house at the date expected and the DVDs had perfect quality.

B00F0N7JUG|5.0|i love this movie great action, the story is pretty good and has top notch actors this  was a must buy!!
0316204366|5.0|As I plowed through D&G it brought to mind a number of instances where decisions I made based on what I thought would be advantageous turned out otherwise - personally having attended a prestigious Ivy League school (Harvard) where I was, in fact, a small fish in a huge pond was finally put into clear perspective.  Malcolm Gladwell has an uncanny lens through which he looks at the 'how and whys' of life in general.  Entertaining, fresh and vibrant Gladwell relates a series of anecdotes and events that drive home how what you see and expect for obvious reasons may often turn out otherwise.  Citing a myriad of examples both historic and current the reader is compelled to review the events of one's own life making this book an accidental 'self-help' manual.  The takeaway he provides end up being the instructions to 'thinking outside the box'. Kudos and 2 thumbs up!
006202406X|4.0|First off, this review will NOT contain any spoilers!<br /><br />Honestly, I was hoping to be able to give this book 5 stars.  I would DEFINITELY give the series as a whole (and the other 2 books) 5-stars but I just can't do it for this final installment.  I enjoyed the book and wouldn't low-rate it like many people are right now due to a particular character death toward the end of the book.  I see why Roth felt the need to go in the direction that she went and I feel like the death was realistic in that I can see the character in question actually making the choices leading up to their death.  It isn't unrealistic.<br /><br />On the other hand, I had a lot of difficulty through the first half of the book in keeping track of which character's perspective each chapter was from.  In Roth's defense, she did specifically label each chapter to differentiate which chapters were from Tris' perspective and which were Tobias.  But, Tobias' perspectives seemed to be written in a very feminine perspective and both perspectives were so similar in the sense of style that I found myself having to refer to the first page of the chapter or looking over the page to find something to remind me who was talking.<br /><br />Overall, the book made me smile, get angry, and completely BAWL my eyes out for the last few chapters. However, I think that Roth being able to cause readers to experience such strong emotional reactions shows how interested and invested everyone became in the characters and how truly great the trilogy and world of Divergent was.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I truly enjoy these books.  The research is thorough and the books are written in an easy flowing manner. A mix of history, sociology, psychology, economics, and good story telling.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Surprising, but silly. it's a good game but I do believe that they need more animals I think there's just not enough.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Wonderful cross decade story of a truly remarkable woman.  Long but never boring description of many kinds of strong relationships.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app!  Did every thing I needed it to.  Simple and easy to use.  Definitely would recommend as a staple to all Kindle users.
1451695195|3.0|It was an okay book.  I received the recommendation from a colleague... said it was the best book she had ever read.  I don't quite agree, but okay.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Eh, cool user interface designs for sure, just on par for current expectations. Story was not complete though, the significance of being on earth was meaningless other than giving me the current earth dweller some connection to the setting. Poor performance my most non-cg cast. What's up with the obnoxious future English accent? What was the meaning of bird saving the boy? Nature still cares for humans, there is hope for humans on earth? Kinda random. Fun to watch though. Good cg.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It was a good book.  There were parts where I was in shock and others where I found myself laughing out loud.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Really enjoying it, what will the cliffhanger be this season? Hopefully WD GOES FOR 7 seasons to &#34;flesh&#34; out the story more.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|this was sad. to call it a pile of crap is a compliment. seriously people dont waste six bucks. go buy something useful and or do some thing with your life
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The graphics suck, the gameplay sucks, and bronies suck! Don't buy this game!  Bronies are scum, and don't deserve a game for their ADHD

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game always makes winning difficult unless you buy more tiles. Not fair. You should be able to win without spending any money.
0316219266|5.0|Not the first book on Amazon, but definitely the most up to date, and also the one with most insights into how Amazon has grown and evolved from the inside.<br /><br />Building &#34;the everything store&#34; is no small ambition, and as you would expect, plenty of interesting stories follow. The book covers the heady days of dot com IPOs in early 90s and Amazons aggressive expansion (most acquisitions failed), followed by the Amazon.bomb trough of the early 2000s, and finally Amazon's rise in the last part of the past decade where it managed to reinvent itself from &#34;online retailer&#34; to a &#34;technology company&#34;.<br /><br />The book is sprinkled with anecdotes and first-person accounts throughout all the chapters, and one thing is clear: for the most part, Bezos treats his employees as dispensable assets. Similarly, Amazon is not afraid to push its weight to claim a stake in a competitor (e.g. corner Zappos, or diapers.com), or get better terms in any other endeavor (publishers, shipping, etc).<br /><br />Brad Stone also provides a brief glimpse into the founding of AWS, but unfortunately does not elaborate much on it - this feels like a serious gap. That said, it's still a page turner, and one packed with a lot of interesting insights about Amazon and future of online retail as a whole.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So excited to receive this DVD.  The price was excellent and it arrived in pristine condition.  Can't wait to finish season 3 of this masterpiece.  Got in a short time.

B00AKKS278|4.0|This is an excellent read. With a mixture of well known exercises, spiced with with original thoughts from Hal it's definitely worth the read.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I first saw the Netflix series and enjoyed that, but when my book group chose to read the book, I was a bit skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised by the read. It's well written, and does an important service by pushing us to think and question the prison system in our country. We lock away, and don't have to think about a huge % of people! yet we should think about them. We should think and talk about why so many non violent people are locked away, and what other alternatives we should consider. Piper does all this by not stating it, but rather by telling her story, it becomes apparent to the reader.<br />I'm so glad I read it!
B00CATSONE|3.0|Author is informative and concise, but is a bit too philosophical. I would recommend this book, especially for young readers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so awesome it challenges your mind to fill farther keeps you sharp I like it so do much
B00FR0V264|5.0|Moondance is one of my all time favorite albums.  I've always had a copy on hand through the years whether on vinyl, 8 track, cassette, CD, or Mp3.  The alternate tracks on this new expanded version of Moondance provide insight into Van and his team at the time's creative process.  I love it!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Amazing book. Loved it from the beginning to the end. The main character is given a remarkable breath of life that makes you interested in his story. Looking forward to your future works.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Intriguing initially, then off with the pixies - literally!<br />Loved the photos.  Nicely written but not my cup of tea.  Stopped reading at about mid point, or bit before.
B0093LINT2|5.0|Its very small and fast. I would recommend it if you plan to convert your tv to a smart tv.
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Its a great concert . Any Zakk Wylde fan has to appreciate the songs he plays in this concert . They put their hearts into this one .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad candy crush is on kindle. Great game to pass time or to keep your mind off of other matters.

B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I as a gamer think it's extremely awesome.the most awesome part is multiplayer on one device. If this game had online multiplayer tournaments and the decision to dress the pb as you like I would rate 8stars
0767836324|5.0|Bought this DVD for my mom's best friend who had lost her VHS version years back so I bought the DVD as part of a movie night box I am putting together for her as a Birthday / Christmas gift. I am buying and collecting movies from her youth to give to her as a Birthday / Christmas gift. I know that she will be happy to own this one again, only this time on DVD. Peter Smith
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and I love playing it sometimes it takes a while to.load but still it is such a fun game
B004SEUIWO|5.0|CHICAGO on film was a surprise.  Thought Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellwegger and their star power might overwhelm their roles, but they glided right into them.  And they could dance and sing.  Enjoyed Queen Latifah, too, who has never disappointed.  The story shined along with the music and choreography.  This film lived up to its stage version. It made musicals contemporary again - won best picture for the Academy Award.  For a kind of noir musical set in the windy city, enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun game, takes a lot of memory though. Kids like this game, too. E plays for hours until battery runs out.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|great beats! good cd. drake has done it again. good songs to sing along to. tracks are not as memorable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I  have a Kindle Fire HD. 3 weeks new. I live in a northern state, dad is in north carolina &amp; daughter &amp; grandchildren are in Florida. I can enter different locations &amp; instantly check on their weather, &amp; mine in seconds. This app was free &amp; is so useful. We had bad wind &amp; storms last night &amp; I was really glad I have this app.
B0054XOMX4|3.0|It broke when it got here.I was so excited about it but it broke the day after it got here.
B00AH69MS8|5.0|I gave this song 5 stars because I love the sound of it, I love the fact that it goes against drugs for good causes. Metallica is my favorite band, also.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read these books over and over again. I just can't put them down!  If I could, I would give them 10 stars!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Book very good. Nice to know what happened to the characters in the story. A decent ending, but wish it had even more scare value. Hoping for a sequel to Salem,s Lot (the scariest book I ever read) soon.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I panicked when Google Reader closed up shop and tried several different RSS readers before finally stumbling into Feedly. It has quickly become the app that I use the most both on my Kindle and my iPhone.  It is near perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game you can beat some of your friend you think it is just like Temple Run but it is not at all because you have hover boards and jet packs and way more things that are way better than Temple Run in my opinion
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really did not like the ending....but I don' t want to say more to avoid spoilers.  But suffice it to say, it ruined my day
B000I55YV2|5.0|great fun movie that you can watch over and over.great cast and plot and it has action what more can you want.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I've of the best books I've read in awhile. Great storyline and although this is scary and can happen in real life in go less he brought attention to domestic violence bc it's something that should not be ignored. This book was very empowering especially toward women. It was intense and kept me anticipating more so I couldn't put the book down!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is a must have movie, if you enjoy action this is one to definitely have along with, Battle L.A., Thor etc! Great for movie night, date night, family night!
1250038820|5.0|Such a beautiful piece of work! Brandon is brilliant! I love and cherish my copy and could not wait to show it off to my friends!
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Much insight here. Expresses what I have felt about working in an office for many years with clarity and wit. Good arguments for virtual companies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a very addicting game but I think it cheats so you will have to purchase things.there is no reason for someone to be stuck for 200  day's.So more candies  should be offered for free
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I re-read The Shining before starting Dr. Sleep, and it was a good thing to do. I was reminded of the humanity of the Torrance family, something that has been lost and blurred over the years, especially by Stanley Kubrick's creepy but unsatisfying movie. Dr. Sleep details what became of Danny, Wendy and Mr. Halloran, but it's Danny's tale and it's a knockout. If you want a synopsis, read another review. Just know that if you're a King fan, and since you're reading this you probably are, he's at the top of his game. I don't think I need to say more.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best out there. If you enjoy logic, and are looking for a soothing game that is also a challenge, this is for you.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Book Club Pick that just isn't my type of novel. I wasn't research the author & didn't realize the &#34;supernatural&#34; nature of his writing. Just a bit too &#34;out there&#34; for me, although there were some times when you heart hurt for the seven-year old narrator.  I will never be able the hear the name Ursula again, nor get the image of a worm in a foot out of my head.  Glad so many others enjoy this type of work obviously by the reviews, but unless you're really into mystical literature, I would not suggest this book.
B00ET3VHZG|1.0|Reaction time too slow to make the game enjoyable to play wouldnt recommend it to a regular chess player sorry I purchased it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love a book that you can't wait to get back to reading! Also appreciate the author's epilogue and how things are &#34;tied up with a bow&#34; at the end, but not in a way that is too predictable. Interesting that it took place in Aus, but I only found a few things that didn't &#34;make sense&#34; to a US reader. Really enjoyed it!! And know MANY &#34;Cecelia Fitzpatrick's&#34; who just not might know what really lies beneath the surface….
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is so great! Best puzzle game ever. If you love puzzled you will love this. I could not stop until I was finished. Can't wait for the next one.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|I know this book is a classic. I know it inspired Blade Runner, one of my favorite movies ever. I love some of the ideas Philip K. Dick explores about empathy and humanity. But, having recently reread it, I just find that the writing isn't very good. The characters feel flat and one-dimensional. The characters don't have any of the subtlety of their on-screen counterparts. Some elements of the story are just plain goofy, such as the Penfield mood organ. I understand why Dick uses the technology, to make a point about humanity and emotions, but the way he uses it borders on the ridiculous, such as setting an option to want to watch TV.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend fans of Blade Runner read this book at least once to understand what inspired the movie. But I for one am glad that Ridley Scott hired different writers to write the screenplay.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is a lots of fun. Not too hard, but still enough challenges to be a lot of fun.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Good game for free. Though it does freeze up from time to time. But it's free so who really gives a squat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is becoming more like minecraft pc it is the best and they are on the correct update
B00G32OER4|2.0|Not scary at all! There was too much stuff going on and happening at the same time. To me the movie was not believable.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I didn't know until the very end how the actual murder/suicide happened. I was in total suspense. I kept looking to see how much longer I had to read because I could hardly wait to see what would happen.  If you love suspense unit the end,this book is for you.
B0081336FO|5.0|I can't believe how well done this show is. It modernizes all of the Sherlock adventures in such a fantastic way...  I'm so excited for series 3!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this game is so great and fun for everyone. So when I play it I feel like I really am having fun. But the game doesn't last forever.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Best show ever!  The characters, the mysteries, the sets... it's all just so good. I can't wait for series 3!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft made for almost every portable device! There are three new blocks added that aren't in pc, and now I can play it wherever I go! I highly recommend this app to people who like sandbox type games and people who play on pc.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a great movie! I read the book and even though it is quite different it stays more true the the later books as far as the characters and the plots. The movie is very entertaining and I really enjoyed the 3D it was very exciting. Can't wait for the second movie to release!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Great price, prompt service, I would highly recommend this to add to your collection at home. Don't miss out on this one.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|Great movie. Online playback was super spotty though and could not dowload it to my computer even though I paid for it in full (????) Why would I want to watch this thing on my IPAD anyway? Amazon- I usually love you so much but your movie streaming/buying policies need a lot of work!!
1846611865|5.0|THIS BOOK COVERS THE LAW ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If now, or in the future, you find yourself as a practitioner representing posh celebs or slightly more ordinary folk for that matter, embroiled in such issues as the privacy, reputational damage and/or commercial exploitation of image and more, this book is for you.<br /><br />Published by Jordans and written by a barrister, a solicitor and an international consultant at the Press Complaints Commission, the book is regarded as the first of its kind to tackle this controversial and high profile area of law in all its many manifestations, from harassment, media intrusion and defamation to sponsorship, copyright, endorsement and merchandising.  In particular it covers issues regarding privacy as it impacts on freedom of speech.  There is also detailed commentary on libel and the Internet.<br /><br />The book draws a number of areas of law together in one compact volume in hardback format, some seven hundred pages in length. Practical guidance is provided on, for example, how to initiate a claim and how to apply for injunctions and to this end, any amount of case law is brought in to illustrate and expound.  Also covered is the Press Complaints Commission's role as assessor or adjudicator, more or less, in determining the degree, or severity of media intrusion in response to complaints.<br /><br />Case law here reveals the PCC as being quite rigorous in its analysis of individual situations. The complaint by Lisa Carling v Daily Mail, for instance, was not upheld.  The even better known case of Rowling v OK was upheld - as fundamentally, it involved the welfare of a young child.<br /><br />These of course are only two examples out of hundreds cited that bring this scholarly, thorough and quite fascinating legal text to life.<br /><br />At this point we believe it is appropriate to observe that those who worryabout the erosion of press freedom in the interests of protecting the privacy of the rich and famous -- or possibly infamous -- can be somewhat reassured by reading this text, but only somewhat.  Such freedom is fragile and often under threat from those who feel threatened by it -- which is why consistently wise councils are needed to preserve it, often in the face of publicity and pressure.<br /><br />This is a book destined to provoke thoughtful debate, which thankfully will no doubt keep the issue of press freedom continually in the forefront of public consciousness and concern. It also goes without saying that this volume will be of major benefit to practitioners who represent high profile clients and therefore a useful and indeed indispensable acquisition for professionals in this area of law.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Very suspenseful with a great storyline. Even though this type of haunting/exorcism movie has been an old classic, this movie felt fresh in it's delivery. Never a dull moment as you wait in suspense for the hauntings to begin. Once they begin, you'll be kept on your toes the rest of the movie!
B00999DFP0|5.0|Watched them all at least three times in rotation at home and in the motorhome. As always it makes the trips so much more enjoyable.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great story writing & acting makes you feel like you're right there with the family. Don't watch this if you don't want to get addicted.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Have them all....they are so good to have along in the motorhome. We like to watch them over and over again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever! It updates every month, and allows you to create worlds of your design and to play with others
B002QCAXOS|4.0|interesting movie, with its nudity, the laughing christofer lee character, the strangely weak policeman(should have had a revolver ot at least a pocket knife to defend himself. this made for an entertaining movie just this side of burlesque
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Why turn one of the great novels of the 20th century into an amusement park ride, especially one so singularly lacking in amusement? The novel is a beautiful tragedy, but this film destroys the novel's beauty and its intregrity by making every single character unlikeable. I felt sorry for the actors, even the hopelessly miscast Carey Mulligan, trying to give continuous performances in the midst of all this CGI, with the shots cutting to something new every few seconds so the special effects could be farmed out to multiple effects houses. The Jack Clayton film from the 1970s knew far better what it was doing.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|An easy read. I enjoyed the flower references, which was a unique idea, but the story was far fetched, so it was ultimately disappointing to me.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great app for my Kindle.  I've had absolutely perfect performance from t his little app. I'd recommend t his to anyone.
1592402690|4.0|While this book has some intriguing and entertaining tidbits about the Beatles and their recording career, from someone who was actually there, please beware that the person who wrote this was a recording engineer at the sessions, and as such is mostly concerned with that side of things.  It can be a bit dry for those not interested in the ins and outs of recording a band.<br /><br />Also, Geoff's opinions of the Beatles themselves seems entirely driven by his personal relationship with them.  Paul was nice to him, so he thinks Paul is the greatest musician of the four.  George (H.) hardly spoke to him, and so George is a hack guitarist.  And, so on.<br /><br />What I read it for mostly, was for the anecdotes and for the secrets as to how they got the sound(S) on their recordings.  And it delivers in that regard.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Easy, fun game for kids and adults.  Gets a little harder as you go like most games but it's still lots of fun.
B00F875N98|5.0|Great Album. Have all the Kings of Leon albums and they are all awesome! This album has a bunch of good songs, a lot that you would just want to stand and clap too. Rock City, Supersoaker and Beautiful War are my favorites.
0385351399|5.0|Awesome insight into what the future can hold if we are not careful.<br />Told as a story of a young girl starting her career.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Liked Iron Man 3 a lot. It's not as good as the 1st one, but much better than the 2nd in my opinion. Robert Downey Jr is as good as ever in this one.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Echoing  the classics, Setterfield unfurls a tale of birth and character.  Who are we really? Are we destined to live out our DNA or can we adopt a genealogy of choice, and adapt ourselves to learning and loving through sheer will to survive and an intention to matter? Keeping the mystery alive while examining the forces that shape character, Setterfield tells a haunting story with artistic skill. I loved it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I wrote a positive review of this item as being easy to set up, and it was.  However, within a short amount of time, I discovered that it is an ENERGY HOG and I cannot seem to get rid of it!  It is still on my Kindle, zapping energy, after I contacted Amazon.  They assured me that it was off my Kindle, but IT IS NOT!  I don't know if they plan to refund my money (I contacted them within 24 hours of purchase) and at this point I don't even care.  I just want it GONE!!!  And I have not achieved that yet.  If anyone knows how to remove Kindle Apps, I would appreciate the advice.  It's one real drawback to the Kindle for users.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|When I first heard it on the app Spotify. I wanted to get the album, I enjoyed Daft Punk's music they produced for the world to hear.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is still an amazing book twenty years after reading it for the first time in Graduate School. A worthy successor to Ender's Game that shows us the adult Ender grew to become. With his great sensitivity and insight into the motives that drive people, as Speaker for the Dead Ender speaks the truth about complex human problems that bring healing in their wake. Orson Scott Card has created a memorable character whose deep compassion and understanding of others breaks down all barriers of prejudice, hatred and fear. Beautiful and highly recommended to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great item. Would have given it 5 stars if you could stream local content from android device. Hope google sort this out soon
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy more than deserves the hype. So well written, truly gripping stuff. Its easy to read, and so compelling, that it truly is hard to put these books down!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this app! But there are some major issues.  First off, I have had lots of &quot;Sorry this game has had an internal error&quot;s and it has frozen up onnme multiple times.  But overall, the game is great. P.S, Bone dragon limited edition ends this November 3.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator is easy to use.  All the basic functions you could want.  After trying a couple other similar apps,  I was glad to find this one.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|NO SPOILERS<br />I am one of the biggest Divergent fans out there... but Allegiant was the worst novel in the trilogy. In fact, it might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Never mind the pointless ending, but the writing itself was atrocious. We started the series in the mind of Tris, and her character was pretty obvious. There was a VERY distinct tone of the first two books in this series, and I think that's what made me fall in love with the books. Roth had a unique and addictive writing style that is completely absent in this novel!!!! It's GONE. Tris and Four behaved in ways they NEVER should have, going along with things they would have never considered in the first two books. I'm all for character development, but not a complete re-write of the characters we fell in love with. Not only did Tris turn into a spineless, whiny little brat, but Four lost so much of his mysterious-bad-boy demeanor that he didn't even seem like the same character.<br />Allegiant read like Roth was bored; like she HAD to finish the series but didn't quite feel like putting all her effort into it.... which is odd because the book IS lengthy, but the quality is AWFUL. I can't begin to tell you how angry and upset I was all day after staying up ALL NIGHT on its release day, but as soon as I started Allegiant I knew I was in for disappointment. I feel betrayed as a fan and not only did I return the book, but I will never, EVER buy another novel by Veronica Roth again. I think she got greedy and forgot about her passion for writing, because it certainly seems like she did.<br />The ending was completely unnecessary and probably one of the most unsatisfying, incomplete conclusions to a series I have ever experienced. Roth did what she did because she could. She did it to prove that she could take a risk. But I think she made the wrong decision and, personally, it made me hate the book even more, which I thought was impossible.<br />If you're a fan, pass on reading this book. Imagine your own ending. In fact, read some clean fan-fiction because I assure you it will probably we better written and more satisfying than this piece of crap.
1451666179|5.0|I loved the mix of new and old material in this book.  I'm so happy to have some of my all time favorites in book form-- now I am prepared for the next power outage!<br /><br />I read this as soon as I got the package and made the mistake of not taking breaks between chapters.  I laughed so hard I made myself dizzy.<br /><br />I was thrilled with the quality off the book and the printing and wish I could think of something clever to write that would encourage undecided folks to buy this book.<br /><br />Edited to add: This book has magical powers.  I said I was ready for a power outage and the universe took me up on the offer.  Our power went out not long after I wrote the original view. :)
B00151HZME|5.0|And this is when M83 kept walking along that way that they'd previously found with Before the dawn heals us.<br />Yet, they're not repetitive. They're just continuing to show the grandness of it all. IT. ALL.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Kids are fan of Minecraft. They will love this!! They are big fan of Mineraft and LEGO. Definitely a winner
0141394811|5.0|This is a terrific book if you enjoy, not just Morrissey, but pop culture in general.<br />It's true that most of us know already a lot of what is told here, but the stories are so well linked one to another, and another, without pause, and the prose is such a delight, that it really doesn't matter that this is basically a confirmation of things previously known. Plus... ALL the DETAILS!!

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am from South Jersey, near Collingswood, and loved reading about all the old familiar places.  Aside from that, it was a great story.  I felt like I was actually inside the mind of a mentally unbalanced person and could understand his thinking process and emotional instability.  I would definitely recommend this book to friends and family.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Not too much to say about it other than we just really didn't care for it, none of us did.
B0094KOSO6|5.0|Great family fun film. Characters are funny, well animated. The cars are surprisingly expressive. My son loves this movie, and my husband and I can enjoy it as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great movie and a great game spinoff. My son absolutely loves this game. One of the better downloads for him.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Fascinating, well written, richly detailed. blurry myths remembered from high school history classes destroyed in this detailed account of the tensions and conflicts in American Society in the time leading up to World War Two. Obvious contemporary parallels.
B00ANAC32U|3.0|This bumper fits my Nexus4 perfectly as it should being an OEM item. However, it is replacing a white version of the same since the silver band running around the white one cracked and completely separated from the unit. Researching online this is a very common occurrence so I am being extra cautious with this black one. I am not taking it on and off if I can help it and I'm very gentle when plugging the power cord in. It's a shame that I have to be delicate with it. It is a very nice looking and perfectly minimal case/bumper to fit my needs though.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is an amazing game that wouldn't work on kindle. NOW IT DOES. I recommend this app 100/5 stars. Thx and have fun.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting and intriguing storyline. I'm addicted! Maggie Smith is excellent; her character is funny (without meaning to be) and unapologetic.  Thomas and O'Brien are, at times, so evil that I have a physical reaction just watching. The romantic in me can't get enough of Mary and Matthew.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Okay so I may be 15 but I love my little pony plus my 13 year old brother is a brony.We love to play it.It has great graphics,perfect characters,and lovely houses.The only flaw is that I don't earn enough stuff for ponies and houses.

B005UKK4Y2|1.0|Only able to watch part of the movie before it was unwatchable on my Tivo HD. I used to rent movies all the time from amazon, but the last 5 movies rented here were unwatchable. I will never rent from Amazon again
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Interesting story of how actions of individuals have far reaching impact on others...and how life goes on.  Guilt, greed, self-absorbtion, loyalty and lust are examined through the characters.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|The final season of Dexter may have disappointed a lot of people, but sometimes that is a sign of excellence. People often crave for their favorite series to end in a &#34;satisfying&#34; manner, but with a show like Dexter there really was no way to end it in a satisfying manner without devolving into the predictable. The common idea was either Dexter was going to get caught, be killed, or some combinationof the two. Both of those storylines would have been predictable and trite even if to some extent emotionally satisfying for those who followed the series from start to finish.<br /><br />I liked the ending to Dexter, not because it was really &#34;possible,&#34; because the whole series portrayed a scenario that was not really very likely. The reason I think it was a perfect ending is because it was unsatisfying, and leaves much to the viewers imagination. We don't know what would have happened if Miami Metro, as a whole, found out about Dexter and his role in Laguerta's murder. You are left to wonder about those things. If everything had been tied up nicely as the critics wanted, then the series would just die. But as it stands, one can wonder what Dexter might be like in 10 years, or whether Miami Metro might still discover Dexter's secret. If your imagination allows it, you can continue to write the series of Dexter and allow it to captivate your imagination for as long as you desire. To me, that is the sign of excellent writing and stories; not that everything gets wrapped up in a satisfying manner. Sometimes life has storylines that don't seem to make much sense, and are never really resolved. Why shouldn't television be the same?<br /><br />None of the questions I posed need to be solved. Dexter was an excellent television show from start to finish. We don't need to know what happens to everyone. Use your imagination rather than criticize.
B004TIKXCE|5.0|Nothing is more compelling than a good man in an evil time. Marcus Aurelius was a person who had absolute power in a corrupt age. Yet despite that, he chose to seek what is true and right and lasting - and he disciplined his own life accordingly. Marcus Aurelius was a just man. In the context of his time, he was a moral ruler (Archbishop Chaput). The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius taken to heart, can change your life in the most positive way.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Nice job by King letting us see what Danny's life has brought after the Overlook. I really liked the book, but agree with some reviews that things may go a little too smoothly for the good guys. Still very nice work with a few things we didn't expect.

B00170MYIS|1.0|I have NEVER written a bad review for a seller, but this guy deliberately cheated me, I believe!  I am not going to spend any more time chasing him down, but I will use the time to write this review to warn others!  I was supposed to get an infoLithium battery, and I got the regular one, which is cheaper (without the indicator of how much battery charge is left).  Well, I called him and he feigned ignorance and said he would mail out a return package for me and send me the correct one.  Guess what?  Never got a return package!  I am not going to waste any more time on this, which is what he was counting on, I'm sure!

B000I3P3EM|5.0|I found the premise of this movie to be engaging right from the very beginning.  I have always thought that many of the Star Trek series didn't concentrate enough on the Klingons.  There is only so much story you can have following humans around in a space ship or space station, no matter the setting.<br /><br />I did find some of the acting of the Klingons to be less violent than their nature has been shown to be in the past.  And Klingons referring to Shakespeare and using a Shakespearean line as a battle cry was just plain hokey.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome stuff there's some cool stuff in here like on Halloween the pony,s dress up in there costumes..
0544002318|5.0|This book is worthy of 5 stars though it is not the best running book ever. Since Steve Friedman is writing it is a well-researched life story rather than an in-depth insight into the toughness needed to endure so many ultramarathons. There is plenty in here to get a glimpse into what it takes. Overall the main take away is that if you give it your all in whatever you do success will follow.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|A fun little game with nice graphics, easily runs on my Motorola Droid RAZR M XT-907. The game starts off fairly easy to allow you a chance to learn how to best accomplish your objective. However it quickly becomes more challenging making the game even more fun. Well worth your time. There are many different levels to complete so don't expect to breeze right through in one day. Take your time and enjoy all this game has to offer. Downloads quickly and runs smoothly. I recommend you start your journey today!
B00F522C7C|2.0|We took our kids who have liked pretty much any G rated Disney movie they've seen (Cars included). Planes, however, had WAY too much &#34;plane lingo&#34; and despite all the action, my kids were bored and didn't &#34;get&#34; the movie. As an adult, there was no humor, no interesting plot - just tons of action scenes one after another. I don't think I laughed once.<br /><br />Total bomb in my book.

B002JF1N0A|5.0|Make sure you buy this one, there is a fake out there written and altered by a creationist and it has the EXACT same name and cover as this copy. Either match up the ISBN or make sure it is the one by Julian Huxley. This is a must read for anyone of any age. Reading his book really puts you back in that time of big ideas and discovery and the search for self.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|This wasn't the worst movie but I did fell asleep. Jaden's acting was average and movie was predictable. A few good moments. .
0316055433|5.0|This is a long, epic, beautifully written, beautifully plotted tour de force which will have the reader who is intelligent, intellectual and insightful enthralled.  Some one- and two-star reviewers obviously need to stick to 100 page teen books, some of which are quite nice.  Those reviews are sadly indicative of the shortening of the American attention span and a growing unwillingness to put some effort and concentration in a great novel.  This novel will have the perceptive reader thinking about another similar novel, Great Expectations.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive game. Fun to play and challenge friends with. I could not stop playing when I started. Be careful  to watch how much money you spend on lives. It is easy to just pay and forget.  Great Game all around.

B006S01GH2|5.0|Thus film is sweet, charming, upbeat, romantic, definitely unique, and filled with scenes of Paris --  What's not to like?  The cinematography is unusual, with many extreme close-up with wide angle lenses, and with what looks like some artificially altered lighting colors.  But the light is part of the mood.  I had seen it once when it came out, and had forgotten most of the details.  When I saw it again on Amazon (via my Roku) this week, I was completely charmed.  Great movie!
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|forgotten how good an author he is. Keeps your brain in full capacity and operation whilst keeping your concentration on all the players.<br /><br />his list of players at the start was a good reference but found I was able to read without any reference to it c
0316204366|4.0|Gladwell's usual, entertaining writing and use of studies to make points.  Some of his examples are a little strained, e.g., his Small Fish in Big Pond point re universities focuses on a small sampling... But, Gladwell is the best at what he does ... definitely worth reading.
B004LUS390|5.0|It's the best sketching app I have ever had. You can put pictures in it and trace or make almost the same picture. But all it needs many layers instead of just 6 or 7. So I highly recommend this if you love to draw on the go or if you don't want to grab a sketch book and all the materials.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|What is the expression: the whole exceeds the sum of the parts? Applies well to this work. Listen to any one track (with the exception of &#34;when you dance&#34;, which is freakin' brilliant), & you go, &#34;OK&#34;. Add them all up, in context, & it is much more.<br />Boys & girls, this is what used to be called an &#34;album&#34;. Enjoy it, as such.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Even if you never listen to anything else by Pentatonix, you'll still love this if you like Christmas music.  This group has given new life to a cappella music - their arrangements and harmonies are crystal clear and epic.  Carol of the Bells and O Holy Night in particular are amazing.  This is a must-have for your Christmas music collection!

B007EDYN36|4.0|I'm not really a KISS fan, but I absolutely respect what they've done.  Any band that can have such longevity and global marketing success deserves to be recognized.  Also ,they are one of those bands that has at least one song that everybody enjoys.  For me, my money is on \\"War Machine\\" even though Peter was not in the band then.<br /><br />This book goes into the details on the money, studio musicians, songwriting and, of course, the drugs.  Peter gets into bottoming out with his career in the 80's, the lame sex with his first wife, the politics of the music business and club gigs and how he needed the money which is why he did the reunion and sold his rights to the makeup.  Although I think the song \\"Beth\\" is by far the lamest Kiss song, this biography makes up for it.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Because this is a good story.  And it's based on fact, which is something I'm interested in. True life tales.
081099741X|5.0|This is THE PERFECT holiday gift for a Wes Anderson fan.  Interviews with Wes, essays about each movie, oodles of pictures taken during production, Wes Anderson style illustrations.  It is a veritable fan feast.  The Michael Chabon essay that opens the book is an astute piece of erudition you won't want to miss.  The delicious colors, quirkiness and big heart of the films are all present in this gorgeous volume.  Make sure you have a nightstand big enough to hold it -- it's a big volume -- and you'll want to keep it near for nighttime browsing.

B00F1CRSKM|5.0|In 2004 I heard Funeral, Arcade Fire's first full-length, and thought it was brilliant. Though I'm sure many will disagree, I wasn't as impressed with Neon Bible or The Suburbs.  I did like about half of Suburbs, but for the most part they both failed to capture my imagination.  Not so with Reflektor. While it is very different in a lot of ways from their earlier efforts, to me it still feels like a natural sound for them. There is a level of passion evident on this record that is infectious. Don't buy in to reviews that call it \\"pretentious\\".. I think someone says that about almost any record really.<br /><br />  This is the first Arcade Fire record released since their debut that I actually love every track on. I especially love the Orpheus and Eurydice tracks, they might be my favorite Arcade Fire songs ever. That's not to say anything bad about the rest of the album though... I had thought to write a review on every track, but then this review would be a whole bunch of \\"this track is awesome! this track is amazing!.. just listen to it. If the first two tracks don't impress you then move on, but if you're like me and you think \\"the title track just rocked my socks off,\\" and \\"that synth part near the end of We Exist is perfect,\\" well then.. what are you waiting for? This is without a doubt one of 2013's very best.

B008JFUNHI|5.0|I'm not well-versed in sci fi \\"lore\\", but after I read what Harrison Ford said about the themes of military ethics this movie addresses, I wanted to see it.  I'm glad I did.  Thankfully, the pace moves quickly and doesn't dwell on moods and emotions or weird aspects of the sci fi technology.  Asa Butterfield is very good as the young actor who plays Ender, the boy/early teen prodigy who is being trained to lead an invasion against a former enemy.  The enemy is a race of aliens who had fought against earth about 50 years before.  Ender has to confront the \\"establishment's\\" modus operandi:  Is it right to attack a group that has been minding its own business because there had been a previous war and you don't want a future attack from them?  This is very relevant to America's foreign policy.  While I believe preemptive war is sometimes necessary when the designs of the enemy are very clear--think of how much better off Europe would have been if Britain had intervened just one year earlier against Hitler, whose intent was unmistakable and who was doing a massive military buildup--there is no justification for war against former enemies that no longer have aggressive intent, or who just want to have access to resources in their surroundings.  I would hope people would see that this is very relevant to Israel's attitude toward the Palestinians, most of whom are peaceful, and that there is a difference between xenophobia (hostility to foreigners, racial apartheid) and being wisely involved in preventing terrorist attacks.  Another thing that struck me thematically was the manipulation of Ender's mind through virtual reality/simulated reality.  When I experienced what I consider the golden age of computer games, in the 90s, they were engaging, but in subsequent years, they have gotten much more realistic and overblown in their effect on the mind.  I am deeply concerned about the psychological effect they have on people, desensitizing them to real-life catastrophes, and whether intentionally or not, this theme is explored in Ender's Game as young Ender plays a game on his electronic device to develop his tactical thinking skills.<br /><br />The other thing that hit me thematically was the exploitation of children.  I felt I was witnessing the corruption of youth as the story of Ender and his classmates developed.  Adolf Hitler was the first leader to so successfully take control over every child's mind, because he had more powerful media than ever before in history.  His Germany was very well connected technologically, better than the extensive Soviet Union.  That made for a very hierarchical, very well controlled training program for the entire society.  Like the Nazis, the military training school in Ender's Game incessantly pushes the children to be merciless and focused only on their mission.  This develops camaraderie for them, but also a coldness toward anyone outside their race.  They also have intense power play against their peers and are forbidden to communicate with their families back on earth.  Hitler Youth and League of German Girls camping events, and the Nuremberg rallies, were how the Nazis brainwashed children.  They isolated them from every other influence, and made them see themselves as no more than pawns for the larger agenda.  Harrison Ford's character, who is not exactly a villain but no hero, either, has boxed himself into an unethical outlook on warfare, and is convinced that children are born to further the collective interest, like Hitler and the other Nazi leaders.  Hitler himself didn't think his agenda was all about him, but about serving his cause of racial purity, a perverted and deeply hateful form of nationalism.  Yet even though the western world is less nationalistic since WWII, this kind of thinking is still dangerously alive, including in America.  Many are convinced that the ends justify the means, and that if the goal is worthy, you don't have to follow constitutional procedures.  That appliesto all kinds of government takeovers and surveillance programs.<br /><br />As I have just described, I see many themes that are valuable in this movie.  Also, the special effects blew me away.  I loved the battle arena where war games are practiced, kind of like a game of laser tag.  And at the end of the movie, there is still hope even though there have been sorrowful consequences.  It is similar to Dr. Seuss's The Lorax, but so as to not reveal too much, I end there.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|awesome show wish I had watched it sooner. very good acting and good plot you will enjoy it very much
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have read all three books in the series and through out the entire series it kept me entertained and wanting to read more
B008JFUNYG|1.0|Another brainless unnecessary remake filled with lame characters you don't care about, convoluted plot, and god awful script.<br /><br />Throwing excessive blood and blah moments do not a horror movie make.<br /><br />Why would you bring a woman who nearly died in an drug overdose to a place far away from a hospital or trained doctors to prevent a relapse?<br /><br />Why would you let her walk around in the woods in the rain by herself then act shocked when she steals the car and tries to flee acting erratically?<br /><br />They simply took rehashed scenes from the original movie slapped it together in this mess of a movie. This was simply a remake made in the same mold<br /><br />as the Nightmare on Elm Street remake.<br /><br />Over the top gore, bad acting and stupid lines ruined this movie.<br /><br />Less is more. In original movie, it was just a bunch of kids heading to the cabins in the woods for a little r&r from civilization. They stumble<br /><br />upon a terrible nightmare hidden in the woods. It had a good pace of creepiness. The movie runs its course of terror and bizarre horror.<br /><br />Not over the top bombastic crap that is more laughable than scary.<br /><br />There must be a list of cool movies that the idiots in Hollywood want to keep remaking and ruining.<br /><br />If you like a mindless gorefest with lame characters, this is for you.<br /><br />Sadly, they just don't make horror movies like they used to.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I've been waiting for Candy Crush to come out on the Kindle market. My older sister owns it and is on level 170 or something. Having recently bought it, I'm on 35, but I do know a lot about the game.<br />  Candy Crush has great graphics and somewhat of a storyline. You are helping a little girl find her way through the world of candy crush, while helping the &quot;owner&quot; of a specific section. With about 10 or 12 levels per section, you have five lives. When you beat a level, that life is not taken from you. When you finish a section, with the exception of the first two sections, you must complete three quests that are 24 hours apart.<br />  Candy Crush does have a lot of in-game buying. Yes, it's trying to cheat you out of your money. But keep in mind that the game is free; they have every right to try. I know I would rather buy a free game with a lot of in-game buying options than a paid game with none. With in-game buying, you can play the game ans choose to spend your money, but you don't have to. That's another thing: the game does not need money to continue game-play. Game-play is completely free. Help with game-play is not.<br />  Most of the bad reviews for this game are complaining about the in-game buying. These people seem to have no patience. With patience, this game is great! However, some people just end up paying because they can't wait. That's what the game is counting on.<br />So, to recap, this game is well-worth your non-money, and, if you decide to do in-game buying, your few dollars. Have fun!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Although one guy over acted, most of the others did a great job. The story moved and was entertaining. The little girl reporter and the editor stole the show.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|My first Liane Moriarty read and I loved it.  She pulls the reader in as she leads you to something almost unimaginable.<br />Terrific writer; looking forward to reading more of her books.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|It was my favorite movie growing up. I loved the bond formed between Tim and Morgan's characters and the story the movie told.

B00FOVD6WE|5.0|for anyone interested in the reasons for Israel's economic success in high tech, this is the book that can explain it to you. It's very well written, and gives true insight into the basis of how a little country became such a technological success story .on
0425223523|5.0|I'm a fan of Amanda Grange - this story in it's original form by Jane Austin &#34;Persuasion&#34; was one of my favourites and to read it from the males point of view was a lovely touch.  Recommend
B0042UEU8M|3.0|Touching and inspiring. Moves slow in places yet keeps you interested.  This was a good transition for Zac Efron from his HS musical days.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a good DVD on days when you don't have a lot of time to workout.  In 20 minutes you get cardio, weights, abs, etc.  It's great!  Plus there are three levels of workouts.  I'm still in the beginner workout but do plan to push to the next level in a couple of weeks.
B000G8NXYG|1.0|One of the greatest movies of all time, but a defective dvd - won't play in any of our dvd players or computers.  By the time I discovered this, the return window was closed.  I expected better quality control from Criterion, so beware, and check any discs right away when you get them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A premise I've not seen before in a dystopian novel, this story with its memorable characters in silos keeps you riveted. I had to buy the whole series, and read it end to end. Loved the characters and the writing.
B003ZDO90G|2.0|Well written and good insight into persons, but so very sad tales, so little personly development.  Numro's books are not my choice for a good literary experience.

0439023521|2.0|The last installment of The Hunger Games was a complete and utter let down.  I knew it would be hard for this novel to live up to the previous two since the first couple of novels had an intriguing and fascinating concept at its center piece—the Hunger Games.  That’s not to say that these were gimmick novels that only had that going for it, but without having the Hunger Games as part of this novel, it would be hard to succeed.  However, if it was well written and well executed, it could still work.  You only need to look at the final installment of the Harry Potter series where the main characters were not at Hogwarts to see a novel succeed that is a major departure in structure from the rest of the series.  But alas, this novel did not even come close to succeeding.<br /><br />This novel failed in many different areas.  The first failing is what they did with Peeta’s character.  It didn’t work for me. Another area of failing was that there were too many technological things that were going on here with no explanation whatsoever.  I’m not expecting hard science from the Hunger Games but they had one after another high technology aspects that seemed utterly implausible with no explanation of how they could be possible, and it really stretched the boundaries of believability.  The ending is a letdown and is anticlimactic.  The direction the rebel president took is also not remotely believable.  Why would rebels who have been oppressed by President Snow follow someone who is just as evil?  In the end, I wished the author had taken a different direction with this novel since this didn’t work.<br /><br />Carl Alves – author of Reconquest: Mother Earth
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book touched me in so many ways. The writing is haunting - the descriptions allow one to feel the emotions of the characters and to gain a better understanding of this period in our history.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Now we know why Harry Hole is considered a specialist of serial killer ... quite complex story, a little too complex in a certain way but captivating; can't stop reading ...
B0007Y08IS|5.0|An excellent movie for an open mind. We have shared it with all of our friends. Some liked it as much as we did and some didn't.
1476733953|4.0|I only wished there was a schematic drawing of how the Silo looked and operated. I had a hard time envisioning what it looked like. Started a little too slow for me but I kept reading and soon I couldn't put it down. Great concept, something I never read before so I was intrigued by the storyline and how it ends. I like that there was more than one main character and where each character has their own positive and negative traits- more realistic. I'm glad I stumbled upon the book and look forward to reading the next two.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was 50 shades of boring! I can't believe I finished reading it and read the other two books as well!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This whole series is a great collection of books. It is a wonderful mix of history, fantasy, romance and drama with no too much of any one of those ingredients. I tend to lose interest after a few books, but I have looked forward to reading all these books. I would highly recommend this book and series to anyone who loves a good story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game where you can get to have fun and if you have friends how play than you can see there world
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|wont work it is a good game but it wont let u download it on the kindle fire it is good though
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|If you keep in mind this movie was done before digital, you'll better appreciate the intricate scenes.  The movie is dark with a crowded future that looks out of control. In the midst of the chaos, a band of elite cops hunt down and kill replicants, robots built to serve mankind that got out of control as the newer more sofisticated models started to develop emotions and wanted freedom, the same things we long for as humans.  In a final scene, Rutger Hauer, the last of the replicants is dyeing and reminisces about all he has seen in the universe, and says &#34;now all this will be lost&#34; and dies!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Works like a charm on the kindle fire  ! Great songs , very realistic ! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good way to practice their piano skills !

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I guess to start out, I didnt know the content of the book so it was a surprise at most. Even though I had never read a book with this content I still felt compelled to keep reading. I loved the characters of course and who wouldn't love Grey. The one thing I do know that you should do, is not stop with just reading the first book . The last book ends with what romance really is. It starts out never perfect, but with work becomes your dream.
B004MPJZ1O|3.0|When it's a Halloween night and this movie is on it's appropriate to feel the creepiness and off putting 70's male machismo which turns around to a new day for women. The caricatures are cheesy but the actors alone are pretty good and do a great job of communicating their fear, disgusted while the violence seems to go on and on. weather they got what was coming to them or not; I don't know; it just might be the time period was changing for more females to stand up against men in the late 70's..
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After downloading this for my son it would not run, even after re-downloading it several times.<br />I would not recommend getting this version, even though it is free.

1594746036|3.0|I feel the synopsis of what the book is about makes it sound a lot better than what it is.  I wanted to like this book, I really did. I had high hopes for it.  Unfortunately, it didn't do much for me.  I was expecting more of a ghost story. Instead I got more of a sci-fi story, and one that wasn't very good.<br /><br />Jacob's grandfather tells him of a magical island of which he spent his childhood. He shows him photos and tells him stories about the peculiar children he grew up with. As Jacob becomes a teenager, he stops believing in his grandfather's ridiculous stories until something awful happens. Jacob travels to the mysterious island to find out about his grandfather.  Little does he know that by going to that island he's put himself and many others in danger.<br /><br />First off, I thought the word building/setting were fantastic.  The author made me feel as if I was on the island. I'll give him props there.  The description of the world was beautifully described.<br /><br />I couldn't relate very much to the characters. I can't really place why that is.  I just couldn't connect.  I found myself not caring what happened to any of them.  Perhaps the author should've spent a bit more time character building to make me relate to at least one the characters.  The characters just felt a bit one dimensional.  There wasn't even one that I could remotely say that I favourited. Okay, that's a lie. I liked Fiona, the Irish girl, but I only liked her because she was Irish, and I love all things Irish. That's it.<br /><br />I found the pacing to be a bit slow. I'd read a chapter, then I'd get bored with it and go off to do something else. I really struggled with this book.  There are a couple of chapters that the pacing is great in, but it's not until the last two chapters that the pacing definitely picks up.<br /><br />The dialogue was easy to understand although some Americans may not get all the slang British terms.  There was one scene where a character says &#34;I was taking a piss&#34; where he meant that he was joking around. The phrase he meant was &#34;taking the piss&#34; which is a British slang phrase for joking.  &#34;Taking a piss&#34; isn't a typo either as it's mentioned a few more times.  This annoyed me because taking a piss, is just that, it means urinating. &#34;Taking the piss&#34; means to be joking around.  Other than that, the dialogue was good.<br /><br />The best part of the book was the photographs found within the book. I loved that little touch! I found myself studying the photos and enjoying them a million times better than the actual book.<br /><br />The cover is also something I loved about the book.  How freaky does that little girl look??? The German cover looks even better.  It's the same photo, just with a green hue.  If I was marking the book based on the cover alone, it'd get 5 out of 5 for me.<br /><br />The title of the book doesn't really leave anything to make you wonder what the books about. It says exactly what the book is about - a home for peculiar children.<br /><br />All in all, this book left me feeling empty. I didn't really feel much of anything reading it until I got to the last two chapters where it got exciting.  However, I will not put myself through the torture of reading the second book in the series especially as I don't care about the characters or what happens to them.  I'm just glad I won this book in a competition and didn't buy it.<br /><br />I was going to give this book a 2 - 2.5 star rating but the ending saved it a bit.<br /><br />My overall score of this book would be 3 stars out of 5 at the best. It's okay, but not great.<br /><br />(This review can be found on my blog).was taking a piss&#34; where he meant that he was joking around.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is very fun and it keeps your mind thinking...I really have fun with this game and it is also very addicting
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I totally love the dinner dash series...especially now that I have my kindle fire. fire. This is the best time management game on the planet. It totally rocks!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It Brings a special peace of mind for the dead and the living. A sense of harmony for what lies beyond.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game I . Like how you have Little scenes when all the characters talk to each other.Take it! (By the way I bought it as the free app of the day just saying)

0761172726|5.0|This has been our favorite &#34;organizer&#34; calendar for years. It's a staple in our kitchen. There is plenty of room to write, and there are five columns for family member names (and maybe someone needs two columns to themselves.) We don't make much use of the stickers, but that's just us. We've tried a couple of the other &#34;mom&#34; calendars, but this one is the winner.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|As silly as this is...I consider it a &#34;Classic Comedy&#34;! I showed this to a class of Business students and although dated they really enjoyed it..
B00545KPRE|5.0|Good sound. Reminded me why I bought the original LP. Bonus tracks are nice, but not essential. Still sounds like they're buried under a ton of reverb, but hey, that's the way it sounded back then too. I like the funky feel of &#34;And the Address&#34;. And I was surprised at how much I enjoyed their version of the Beatles &#34;Help.&#34; Blackmore's solo on that one is terrific: short, unruly, inspired and not what you'd expect. The quasi-classical intros to some of the songs are an acquired taste. At the time I thought they were cool to copy Rimsky-Korsakov, de Falla, etc. If you liked the original (like me) you'll still get a kick out of this. If this is your first time hearing it, it probably will sound hokey and dated.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I really like the part in the book where Oria is given advice on why she can defeat Yori. The difference was- Oria is unselfish while Yori is selfish. Unlike some fiction, where the bad guy could be evil  as a cover, this book speaks on good versus evil. I like stories where the bad guy has a soft side and/or becomes good. However, it is good to have a reminder there is evil and it needs to be defeated.
B000026KG7|3.0|Some good/great songs. Some noisy stuff, too. I lost interest in DP when they went metal, unlike most folks who started to like them then, and don't know about the early stuff of their first three albums. They put out three albums in around a year, and that's a lot of work.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What's not to love about this British show!  Great dialogue, great costumes, great stories!  Love it!  I bought season 1 and 2 for my mother who is British.  I was shocked she hadn't seen it.  I know she will love it as much as I do.  Can't wait for season 4!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Fabulous show! Great deal. The suspense and intensity of this show are incredible. Clair Danes and cast are all terrific. And I love being able to a)watch several episodes in a row; and b)replay to catch missed dialogue!
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|could not figure out how to make my own gmail arrive on the gmail client....it would not take my password . I wish it worked!
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Method acting at it's best: Day-Lewis is unbeatable. Madeline Stowe is beautiful, articulate and brave. Wes Studi is vicious and deadly. Russell Means steals the picture with very few lines. Plus the scenery and soundtrack are stunning.<br />So far, the best adaptation of the American classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting and it is great! It is so much easier then going on line.  I especially like it because it is free
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game. It just gets annoying when you have to either wait for more lives or purchase them.  I play until my lives are out and quit.  I really like the game though.  It is very addicting.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie is funny, sincere and brutally honest.  All of these things make this book a GREAT read...oh and of course the awesome illustrations don't hurt either.  There are many subjects in this book I identify with and they make me laugh out loud, typically around strangers who then look at me like I may have something wrong with me.  But, this book makes me not care.  Of course, there are things in this book that I CAN'T identify with, like the chapter about the goose (you will have to read this book to find out what that means).  Those chapters just made me laugh so hard, I cried.  I hope Allie writes more books, if she does, I'll buy those too.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I'll help you keep some of your hard-earned money. Danny grows up to be a drunk like his Dad did, but he joins AA, and we are there with him for every agonizing step of the program.<br />  I have been a \\"constant reader\\" with S.K. since Carrie, and have always bought his books still warm from the press, but after his last several books I'll just wait for them at the bargain bin; the wait isn't very long. I think he has allowed his political veiws to rob him of ability to communicate with \\"the common man.\\" Over the last few years he can't write a shopping list without tossing in a left-wing talking point or three. It's not that I disagree with all his political views, because I don't, but if I want to constantly hear liberal jargon I'll watch MS-NBC. All the 5-star ratings are from people who share his political ideals or from people who rate him on past works instead of the current work they are writing the review for. I  will always feel a debt towards Mr. King for the countless hours of pure joy I got from his writings, but I won't be dishonest.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|For many years I have re-read treasured science fiction and fantasy novels, but inspired by my delight in my recent eager devouring of some of Ben Bova's work I have started broadening my horizons to see what else I may have missed in the last few decades. I am so pleased to have read Ender's Game.  The story telling here is not burdened by pretension or unnecessary flowering, but the characters, drama and setting are no less vivid for the tight story telling.  I powered through this wonderful work and would highly recommend it to any sci-fi fan.  The characters and the relationships between them are spellbinding.
B00BCK1A5G|2.0|Very disappointed!  The hero and heroine were very 2D apart from memories of their childhood.  The story line dragged and was extremely repetitive.  There was never a feeling of eminent danger and the lack of other characters from the series  meant you were left with a romance between characters supposedly silent! This book only progressed the continuing story line in the last chapters of the book.  This story should have been a novella with a price tag to match!
0307592731|4.0|This book was fantastic. Makes me want to hike the PCT. I plan on someday hitting the trails in Oregon. Great read
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love this cd every song is good on the cd, keeps your feet tapping. Well worth the price and well done.
B000NHG7BG|3.0|I seen the movie a long time ago and I thought it would be good to look at every now and then and also to show guest when then come over to visit.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is outstanding and every song on this cd is the balls. Im 60 years old and love how she rocks.
006202406X|2.0|I liked the book as a whole.  Got lost a few times with the character switches though.  I do think the Tris/Tobias love tangle should've at least led to something more before the ending, not the extent of 50shades but a lil' somethin'.  Also, I didn't analyze each little detail so it made some sense as far as plot and the GP/GD stuff. That being said, I HATED the ending.  I agree not all books have to be happily ever after, but I could see someone else (ie- Eve or Marc, or even Xtina).  I'm not saying outright what happens, but I was very disappointed with the outcome.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is simply wonderful and so is this cd, worth every penny. She has such power and passion in every song.
0385537131|4.0|Probate Court thrillers are hard to find, no doubt because the things that happen in Probate Court rarely are considered exciting by anyone except the heirs. It's a lot of paperwork and rarely a contested hearing. So, for John Grisham to believe that he could write a Probate Court thriller took not a little bit of hubris. By the looks of all the five star reviews here, many think he did. But most of the excitement he conjures up happens outside of the courtroom, He revisits racism in the South, and that inevitably contains multiple horror stories. Some sympathetic characters and their polar opposites star in the book. So it's really not a Probate Court thriller after all. It's a well-written look at people who have lived through those dark times long after the worst of it happened. That's not a bad thing to look at, and I did give the novel four stars, but I think that fourth star is a little shaky. Maybe a little less Probate Court would have helped, because I know it bored me.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|Tim Burton's masterpiece in our opinion! Great for whole family to watch on a movie night. Danny Elfman's music is the perfect blend with Burton's unique characters. Love story, horror, action and musical combined in one dynamic package.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|The biggest mistake anyone could make would be to watch this movie only once. Groundhog Day grows on you over time. It's the one indispensable accessory for February 2, and it features a standout performance by Bill Murray. It also poses some interesting philosophical questions as it traces his journey from egocentric loser to mensch. The classic game for seasoned Groundhog Day viewers is to try to speculate on the number of February 2nds the hapless weatherman must go through during the course of the film. Delightfully funny as well as romantic.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is absolutely superb. Not only is it easy for the layman to understand and operate, it also has enough spec detail for the inner nerd in all of us. I love this app.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Anyone who saw Toy Story One could be forgiven for being a bit skeptical about this sequel, but Pixar was more than equal to the task of embellishing and expanding the universe of Woody and his fellow toys. The edge-of-your-seat adventures of Woody's would-be rescuers and Buzz Lightyear's reunion with his long-lost father deliver more than one laugh-out-loud moment.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I haven't found the next season, and I may have to beileve that this great show did not continue to a second season.  I love'd it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I tried to resist playing the game. Everyone I knew was playing and would ask if I played. I resisted as long as I could. I was told how addictive it was, and they were not lying. Can't stay away.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Entertaining, keeps you guessing, hot scenes and a man who has a lot of patience for what he wants. Got this book for a rainy afternoon and it fit the spot!
B001B1T7BU|5.0|This is a great children's/ family movie.the actors and animals are incredibly funny. Great remake of the animated Disney classic!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I to am so happy they made a Kindle version. Ty ty ty now I can stay on top of my game anywhere.
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|It is a bit to long. A lot of it could of been cut out to make it shorter, and would increase viewing pleasure. Is worth watching though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very exciting game. Can't wait until you reach next level.  Very addicted. To bad I have been stuck at level 70 for a long time now. Wish there was some way to get hints......
