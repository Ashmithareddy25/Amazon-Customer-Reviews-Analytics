0062060554|5.0|Within a few pages after starting this book, I was enthralled. It is superbly written and keeps you moving page to page. I usually would be annoyed by a book that has journal writing within it, but this kept things moving very quickly with a great deal of suspense. Super easy to read, thought-provoking, interesting. It wrapped up nicely but without hurrying things or providing too many answers. Deeply satisfying read.
1594744769|5.0|Remarkable! After reading two paragraphs in the bookstore, I found the language so delightful that I bought the book--and finished it within a week. Suspenseful, magical yet real, a wondrous tale told through both words and pictures. I think everyone is getting this book for Christmas.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|this is an excellent show, and really doesn't get enough credit.      Sadly some of the disks don't work, and since there are so many it may be a while before I figure out which one's don't so I can replace those.  Of course the season premier of season 4 is one of those that doesn't work.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|We knew it would be incredible, and lo and behold, Revelator is one of the best albums to come out in a long time.     Come See About Me - 10/10. A great Little Feat-esque groove, an incredible vocal delivery, and derek's exceptional playing start super strong right out of the gate. No complaints here.  Don't Let Me Slide - 9/10. A great mellow tune which features some exquisite backround vocals and slide, which blend in with each other in a great way.  Midnight In Harlem - 10/10. Just a great tune. They play the definitive version of it, everyone's performance is top-notch. A classic tune for sure.  Bound For Glory - 10/10. Speaking of classic tunes... this one should be \\"the single\\" for sure. It has a great gospel-soul-rock flavor. The horns shine, and the pocket is quite tight.  Simple Things - 8/10. A fine song, not quite up to the level of the first 4, but still great. Susan gives a soulful but mellow delivery which works perfectly.  Until You Remember - 10/10. Think Otis Redding's ballads. The Burbridges play incredibly tastefully, Derek lays down one of his most lyrical solos, and the dynamic contrasts are off the hook.  Ball and Chain - 9/10. First of all, it features piano put through a leslie. Second of all, it has a great, original-sounding chord sequence.  These Walls - 10/10. A great surprise that reminds me of Mahjoun. Beautiful melody, great middle eastern flavors that compliment the tune.  Learn How To Love - 10/10. Gritty, a superb contrast from the previous song. Low-down and dirty.   Interlude - Funky and tight. Great playing.  Love Has Something Else To Say - 10/10 Everyone gets a chance to shine, and shine they do. The horn lines, solos, bass grooves, etc. pile on top of each other into a funky masterpiece. There is a call-and-response solo section where Derek gives his most ridiculous recorded solo of his career. And I mean that in the best way.   Shelter - A great way to end the album, a peaceful song which sets a great tone... oh wait, there's more?  Ending jam - Absolutely crazy Derek solo, just 5 of the best musicians in the world getting down.    The remarkable thing about the album is how it is entirely tune-based, but at the same time every musician has a chance to shine without conflicting with anyone else's sonic space. The album has great songs, and will be a classic for years to come.

B000021Y77|4.0|\\"RUN LOLA RUN\\" is a Film that Grows on You. One story three different scenarios, Exhilarating as I watched Lola Run and Run through the City towards three different Endings with subtle differences between each version; by the time the third one began...\\"OH NO, NOT AGAIN!\\"...I was exhausted perspiring and in need of a Brake, but she kept on Running and Running...you see TIME is the Essence for Lola as the song goes...\\"What a difference a day makes twenty four little hours\\", By the time she was done Running I was all worn out sweaty and confused. One of the most absorbingly exciting Films I have seen in a long time. Check out the Cool music Video in the DVD Special Features. Now, if I could only SCREAM THE WAY LOLA DOES!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm so glad to be seeing some of the popcap games pop up, and Plants vs Zombies is one of their long-awaited for classics.  Granted, I do most of my game-playing on my iPad because I like the screen size better than my 4-inch EVO but it is great to be able to pull this out when I want to waste a half an hour and I don't have my iPad around.    It works smoothly on my EVO and the graphics are just as good as my iPad... just a little smaller.    Why are you even reading this?  It's Plants vs. Zombies.  Get it!  My wife HATES games and she still uses this to entertain herself.

B004PKO5AM|4.0|That's an outstanding documentary that give us an idea of this brilliant mind through the eyes and memories of those who had the pleasure to interacte with Carlos Kleiber.   Also show us his extreme perfectionism and his self-critical that led him to limit his recordings and appearances; therefore this is a good way to complement the legacy he left behind.
0545123267|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater writes beautiful prose, there's no question about that. Her words provide a vivid landscape in which this compelling story unfolds. That being said, some of the prose are a little overwhelming and somewhat out of place. In one instance, Sam describes himself as a \\"leaky womb\\" which was not only a disturbing visual, but an unattainable analogy. Forgiving these little foibles, I moved past the occasional incongruous prose and settled into the story.<br /><br />The concept of werewolves changing due to environmental factors - the cold - was an interesting one and not something I had ever seen before. There's also appropriate suspense-building as Sam fights to stay human through the increasing cold while he and Grace simultaneously search for Jack (a newly changed werewolf) and a cure.<br /><br />I do have a few niggling issues with the story as a whole: Grace's absentee parents seemed an easy out, an unlikely friendship with vapid Isabel seemed out of place, and the love story seemed a little to easy. The idea that Sam practically moved in to Grace's bedroom without so much as a run in with Grace's parents', seems unlikely. There's a lingering plot thread which involves Shelby which was left unsatisfied, though, I hope, it will be addressed in book two.<br /><br />Aside from these issues, Shiver was a very satisfying and well written story. The world which the author created was stunning and the growing cold seemed to creep from the page.<br /><br />Moving on now to Linger.

0525422943|4.0|I liked Where She Went, though I wanted more than anything to L-O-V-E it. Perhaps it was the sometimes long-winded narration, maybe it was that somewhere in the middle the momentum puttered out and the plot went on a walk-about through a jungle of distractions, I'm still not exactly certain this fell a little short for me. What I do know is this, I'm pleased that the mystery of what happened next is answered, though perhaps a little too neatly at the end, and I loved Adam's hearing voice for the first time.<br /><br />Gayle's writing is lovely, as usual, and her prose are so simple yet so full of meaning and emotion. Anyway, it's definitely worth the read, especially for those who love the characters of Adam and Mia, as I did.
0345529057|2.0|The first book was fantastic.  It was very exciting to get drawn-into the worlk of the Starks and the kingdom.  I couldn't wait for more and bought this 4 book set.  Unfortunately, the story goes off-track as you get further into the series.  It seems like George R. R. Martin wants to do way too much with way too many characters.  Personally, I can't really care about all 20 different characters that he wants to track equally.  I care about the Starks.  And Martin is intent on killing them and their dire-wolves off, it seems.  So WAY too much time is spent on characters that aren't nearly as exciting as the Starks.  Martin just goes too broad as the series expands and what went from an awesome first book and a good second one quickly goes to a boring 3rd and 4th.  I'm not even sure I'll want to read the next one.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he tries to turn this into a 10-book saga.  He should have kept it to 3 or 4 solid books and focussed on the Starks.  But he didn't.  So now I'm reading The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson and am loving every page.  Sanderson sticks with the characters that I care about without continually introducing new ones to lengthen the story.  I prefer that style of writing.  So the 2 stars are for the first 2 books.  I can't give any for books 3 and 4 as I really struggled to stay interested.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I had waited on reading this book for a while, as I was caught up in other books for a long while. However, had  known how hard the reveiws that I read about it were, it would have been on the top of my list. It caught me up at the begining and pulled me through until the end.    I must say that I am partial to fast paced books, and this was a great example.   One thing about the reveiws that stuck to me were that they said it was covered at the sticky parts with lame jokes, and the writer tried to hard to be casual. For children my age, the jokes were funny, and the language common. My friends talk the same way as Percy`s. The writers of most of the  negative comments probrobly didn`t have upper grade or middle school age children that went to public schools. It was a good book, my favorite, and it was well written, realistically written, and a perfect fit for anyone aged  9 to 13
B004TTMYQG|3.0|adds much needed multi-day view (called week), allows moving items from one calendar to another after you create them.   This app needs two big usability improvements. First, it needs to shade out appointments that you turned down in the multi day view - the same way that the native calendar app handles it. Right now, appointments that you decline appear exactly the same as other appointments. The second fix that is needed is the agenda view needs to hide appointments that you turned down. It gets terribly cluttered and there's no way to easily see which appointments you accepted or declined.  I also would like snapping full days at a time rather than part-day scrolling when moving your finger sideways in the multi day view, but that's a relatively morning point of feedback to the developer compared to the other points I just made.
B003MC5N28|2.0|Although in my book club this got high reveiws, I completely disagree.     I could not catch on to the story. Before I could used to the beginning of the concept, I was on the last page. The whole&#34;perfect world&#34; idea was original, but hard to both comprehend it as the meaning and stick to the idea. It was ... different. However, the ending wasn`t very clear. You could not tell what happened to the main character at the end, so it did not work well for me.    Original, but not for me.
B000GH2YPG|4.0|The book is well written and captivating. The author invites you into a world that is not well defined in time; you are ushered into a story told by an unnamed young lady who gets married to a rich man whose wife had fairly recently died. The main character, a shy and naive young lady, undergoes quite a transformation not only as she takes in her new role as a wife, but also as she struggles to meet the expectations for someone in her position. Her personal limitations are only a small piece in the puzzle that eventually reveals itself.<br /><br />The story varies in pace. At one point it really picks up and it becomes very hard to put down. I recommend this book; it makes for a good read.

B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men: First Class is an exciting and fast paced prequel to the other X-Men films, that tells the story of how Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) befriended and started a school for mutants. Xavier tries to get Lehnsherr to get rid of his anger and remember his good memories, but Erick can't help wanting revenge on a powerful mutant named Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), for reasons I won't give away.<br />  Director Matthew Vaughn (Kickass), who backed out of doing X-3 and was replaced by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) \\"and his black leather fetish\\", proves here that he's as good at making comic based movies as Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight), Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) \\"if you don't count Spider-Man 3\\" and Jon Favreau (Ironman).<br />  Hell, I wish Vaughn will do any X-Men film for now on, including Wolverine 2. He does a great job capturing the look of the 60's, as well as handling such a big cast and giving them all a good amount of screen time and character build up. While all of the performances are well done, Fassbender especially gives an intense and star making performance as Magneto and even outshines the great Ian Mckellen in the role. Mckellen was a little too laid back in the role of a man who lost his parents to Nazis, Fassbender however brings out that anger perfectly.<br />  Movies like Thor and X-Men:First Class shows that maybe Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to give us summer movies that are actually worth seeing. Roger Ebert some how didn't think so and thinks that every comic based movie should be more like Spider-Man 2. Why, though ? When Thor and X-Men: First Class are faithful and well made adaptions of their comics.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This is a current take on the classic Sword and Sandal epics of the past.  The production value is first-rate.  The History is not!  For one I doubt the Romans would have used a Goth looking Celtic Femme as a tracker.  They had their own resources on which to rely, and they were rather chauvanistic in their outlook.<br /><br />The standard portrayal of corrupt Roman officials prevails.  This is a gritty and dirty film as far as the shooting goes.  The scenery is impressive for sure.  The Roman ambush has your cliche Sparticus rolling fire bit which is debatable if anyone ever used in these conflicts.  Fight scenes are tough and realistic.  The storyline is almost like a WW2 squaddie film grafted onto Roman times.  Legion gets wiped out due to predictable Roman incompetence.  Handful of survivors fight their way home through the darkness of old Scotia and the Celts.<br /><br />The unfortunate ending has our hero betrayed by the standard corruption of evil Empires that the movies like to show these days.  The aged Roman counsel Agrippula was actually a good commander.  Not the back-stabbing wretch that is shown here with his evil Courtisan.<br /><br />The end provides for closure with our hero having the potential for a nice romance with a beautiful Celtic witch!<br /><br />Entertaining, good production value, decent acting, BAD HISTORY!  It really deserves 3 stars for that, but I decided to show mercy and give it a thumbs up 4 stars.
0061205699|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  I have read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (hereafter TKAM) twice in my life - as a high school senior, and, oddly enough, as a Suffolk Law School student for a course in Professional Responsibility and Legal Philosophy/Ethics.  In this review, I will not dwell on TKAM's predominant themes of racial prejudice and social intolerance.  Instead, I will focus upon attorney Atticus Finch's character and the climactic episode which reveals that, despite appearances, he is not a saint, but all too human.  The following excerpt is actually copied (with edits) from an essay I submitted for the law course:<br /><br />  \\"Atticus Finch, the near-mythic but unsung and ultimately human attorney in TKAM, seems to possess all the conventional virtues.  He is a good lawyer, citizen, and parent.  Atticus assumes Tom Robinson's case certainly not from a guarantee of fortune, fame, success or charity, but to keep setting a good example as a good lawyer, citizen, and parent. He is courageous.  Most importantly, whether in his house, on the public streets, or in the courtroom, Atticus is the same morally and legally admirable man.  However, he is not a missionary; nor a mercenary; nor a legal idealist.  Atticus is just...Atticus.<br /><br />  Above all, Atticus is an optimistic realist.  He realizes that defending Tom Robinson was in one sense a futile gesture, but takes heart in the fact that this jury took longer than previous ones (would have) to convict Tom. Atticus (believes) that the law will ultimately obtain justice, albeit slowly and incrementally.<br /><br />  However, after Bob Ewell's murder attempt on Scout and Jem and his subsequent death, arguably Atticus betrays his legal credo.  Atticus is prepared to defend Jem against the murder (of Bob Ewell) based on self-defense, and perhaps on evidence that Boo Radley killed Ewell.  (However), Sheriff Heck Tate slowly dissuades Atticus from his professional objective with assurances that he can \\"prove\\" Ewell killed himself accidentally.  Perhaps, understandably, Atticus relents because parental instinct, compassion, and disillusionment over the court system similar to the one Tom Robinson faced make him reluctant to subject Jem and the reclusive Boo to such a legal ordeal.  Despite this arguable professional lapse,...my choice for a legal (and certainly humane) paragon would inexorably be Atticus.\\"rove\\" Ewell killed himself accidentally.  Perhaps, understandably, Atticus relents because parental instinct, compassion, and disillusionment over the court system similar to the one Tom Robinson faced make him reluctant to subject Jem and the reclusive Boo to such a legal ordeal.

0307463745|4.0|REWORK chops down the overgrowth in today's corporate jungle; memos, meetings, mentality, work, etc. It then takes those choppings, and fertilizes new ideas.     In today's day and age, it's hard to tell whether or not the work we do has any real value. This book gets down to the core of what work really is, and the principles that made so many people successful. It's not about working hard so one day you'll become the boss and work harder. It's about being efficient.    REWORK provides good examples from efficient companies (as well as good examples from bad companies). All the knowledge contained in this book not only makes you a better worker - but a better person as well. You'll find more meaning in the work that you do, be less stressed, and have more time to enjoy your life.    This book is for everyone who works, but it is specifically for management level workers. It emphasizes doing more with less, and doing less for more. After reading REWORK, you'll probably feel really tempted to go out there and change the world - but then you're reminded that you need to take it one step at a time.
B001668J8M|5.0|I bought this item and never really paid much attention to the second disc in the set until now. The second disc is the Alternate version of the film and so much better than the original.    I have always hated the ending of the original version. This alternate is so much better and while the CGI still looks weak, The Dark-seeker Leader displays so much expression in his face that you didn't get to see before.     I am very glad I bought this steel-book set.
1591843790|4.0|This book is a good intro for beginner and intermediate \\"enchanters\\". It lays the foundation and mentality that you need to have. The best part is, it has nothing to do with charisma. Anyone can pick up these tools of the trade and become an expert enchanter.    As I read this book, I felt like I was there with him as he gathered all his examples. At the end of each chapter, there is a real-life example of how someone came to enchant or be enchanted. There are no over-night success stories, it's something that has to be practiced (and often).    Be warned though, there are a lot of examples looping back to Apple products (at least it came from someone who worked for them). If you're looking for specific methods to enchant people, you won't find it here. This book can only change the way you look at things, but only you can change what needs to be.

He is one of the most thoughtful writers of our time, and communicates in a simple fashion that makes it easy to interpret his logic and conclusions. He applies this same, simple writing style to this book in a manner whereby you feel like you are experiencing what he is experiencing firsthand.  I have to say, after reading this book, I started to look at the world a different way and I really need to keep it nearby for every major stage in my life going forward.

B000P12LWY|2.0|I just finished Season 1.  Anyone genuinely interested in gauging the historical value of this series must be forewarned to keep the \\"fast forward\\" button handy.  There are numerous pornographic scenes, which serve only to celebrate Henry VIII's immoral behaviors.    While Catherine of Aragon & Saint (Bishop) John Fisher seem to - thus far - get respectful treatment, Saint (Sir) Thomas More seems to be getting portrayed as a religious fanatic.  Jeremy Northam's Thomas More is barely recognizable as the same man [[ASIN:0679728228 played by Paul Sofield, as possessing a flawless, articulate brilliance and magnificent strength of character - surpassed only by his faith in God]].    On a much more mundane note, it is difficult to tell how much time is supposed to have passed from the first to the last episode.

B000002H6C|5.0|This was Metallica's last full-fledged thrash album, and their fourth consecutive near-perfect example of metal music.  Justice has a little bit of everything; plenty of speed, heavy mid-tempo sections, a half-ballad, an instrumental, and great thrash riffs and solos.  James's voice is gruff, aggressive, and powerful.  For me, this is his best vocal performance out of the first four albums.  Stellar songs like Blackened, the title track, Harvester of Sorrow, Frayed Ends of Sanity, and Dyer's Eve stand out, but the other songs are not filler by any means.  Most people know that One was the first song to get Metallica mainstream exposure on MTV, a fact more than a few fans resented.  Over time, some of those fans have changed their opinions on Justice and blamed it for the band's transition into radio metal.  One thing I remember for sure, though, is that back in the day when it came out, nobody talked crap about this album.  It was given credit as proof that Metallica was the best band in thrash, and rightly so.  It still sounds great today, and in my opinion, ranks as one the top metal releases of the `80's.

B0000041Z5|5.0|I bought this set when it was issued \\"on sale\\" sometime in the 1980's by the Musical Heritage Society under its own label (MHS 11168T ff.) While I have always enjoyed Solti's approach, the recordings are AAD and I always thought them a little heavy in the low end--less crisp than the DDD versions of other music I'd heard, especially back then. As other versions of these works have come along, I have listened to them and compared. I now believe that the Solti/CSO sound comes closest to what the composer had in mind. After a great many listenings, I am convinced: THIS is the one. For me, the only rival is Bruno Walter's vinyl set that, in my opinion, didn't successfully make the transition to digital.     If you want the Brahms symphonies (and who doesn't?), buy this set.  And, you will get as a BONUS superb renditions of the Academic Festival and Tragic Overtures.  And, the price is right; even less than I paid 20 or so years ago! What's not to love?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Many artists tend to slack off on their sophomore albums, and leave us disappointed. Adele does no such thing. This album is beautiful and flawless from start to finish. Adele has a luscious and unique voice, but I think what really strikes me is the way I can hear and feel the raw emotion in her voice. It's amazing that she's so young, because exhibits a level of maturity far beyond her years.    Favorite tracks: Turning Tables, Set Fire To The Rain, I'll Be Waiting, Someone Like You

B001DMJ9R4|5.0|The Diamonds in the Rough CD is good, nothing too spectacular but a good addition to a music collection.  Some songs are generic and some are catchy, not to mention a nice cover of Flash of the Blade.  The best part is the live DVD.  I own several live in concert DVDs and this is by far the most amazing.  The quality is top notch, the sound is amazing, as is the stage presence of A7X.  The only thing that I can complain about is the quick camera shots, which sometimes (very, very rarely) make it difficult to watch with camera views lasting about half a second.  Overall though, it was not enough for me to dock it a star, since the sound of rock is what I was after.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I can now safely say this album passed the \\"time\\" test. SOTU gets better and better with age.  There are some hidden masterpieces here. In chains, Jezebel, In sympathy. I like Dave's songs too, with Come back being my favourite of the two. I like how it distorts into a mess in the end.    But the best, in my opinon are \\"deluxe\\" tracks - Light and Ghost.  Light goes up in their best-ever song list. It's so emotional, SO depeche mode, with great music and features phenomenal lyrics. Ghost has a slight b-side feel, but it's a strong track with great lyrics. Why on earth they excluded those two songs from the original SOTU list is beyond me!!!  There's another one - The sun and the moon and the stars. It's a great Martin track, however I like it as a \\"microdrum\\" mix. The original isn't as good as that one. Microdrum-mix absolutely shines!    All in all, very very good and unique effort from the band, considering their active age and what they have been through. I must say I play SOTU a lot more often than PTA (and PTA is great too, but a bit tiresome for my ears).

B004LWZW24|5.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS      What I liked about this particular horror film is the extremely scary images that pop up. Not only do they pop up but they stay up so you can get a good hard look at them!  It also plays on real fears like the monster under your bed (ok not realistic but it has plagued children for ages) and having some stranger outside your house (the baby room scene with the guy standing out the window scared the s**t out of me as did the bedroom scene with the guy pacing outside the window.)    The main monster was kind of a mash up of Darth maul and Freddy Kreuger but was still very scary. He had his little \\"surprises\\"    The movie is extremely scary without using any blood which is what I like (except for one scene where each of the family in the furthur has a single gunshot in them.) I didn't want to see a gorefest (if I did I'd just put in an 80's teen slasher)    I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND CANNOT WAIT TO GET IT ON DVD!

B001NLKWLW|3.0|The Forgotten Garden was okay. It captured my attention right away, but didn't hold it throughout the entire book. I think the book was a little too long and the back and forth between times and characters was a little tedious. I enjoyed the present day and past characters, but I did not enjoy the Nell character. I understand her role in the book, but I couldn't connect with her. I would have like the present day characters to be more developed.     Overall - it is a good book. Just not one of my favorites.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|first and foremost i was very satisfied with this movie, normally movies based on reality dont always show up right to me. im a movie guy! i love good movies! i seek out good movies. the acting in some wayz was cheezy and time seemed to fly by thoughout the movie, ha well what do you expect, your not looking for a 127 hour movie! in the time to illustrate a mans experience in this movie was good enough for me! it was moving, illustrative, encouraging, adventurous, inspiring. IT'S A GOOD ONE! WATCH IT. but only if your into movies. i'm not a book reader, and of course there will be missing words from a book. but as a movie! it's great.<br /> as far as the environment and setting. it really illustrates mans way of thinking. like all man before, explorers, adventurest, scholars scientist! is to conquer everything... i grew up in the terrain such az this, in northern arizona. a native american growing up on the navajo reservation. i was taught growing up to live in HARMONY. \\"WALK IN BEAUTY\\" as the navajo tribe say it. meaning to walk in harmony. man cannot conquer the land or the sea. but to live in harmony they can. respect mother earth, because she has provided all our needs.<br /> well that's what stood out to me, was we can enjoy life, enjoy the fruits this land has to offer with respect. but to become over our heads and think we are the top of the world. one small step, and you slip and roll back down the mountain! haha.
6305508550|5.0|if you work in an office, you NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!<br /><br />It is an instant classic and more relevant now than ever.  I watch and rewatch my copy!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|fabulous book. Ended just the way I would have wanted.  It was nice to have such a strong heroine to follow.  She is the underdog but someone you want to see succeed!  fabulous read!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Interesting, somewhat original take on the marooned alien on earth genre. the movie is fast paced the special fx are mind blowing! Can't wait to see part 2.
0553381695|3.0|GRR Martin states that he wants the reader to know he isn't afraid to kill of the main characters. He want the readers to realize that when any character is in danger they are likely to be found dead in the coming pages. While this is great story telling it soon became predictable; assume the worst is likely to happen to the good guys and the bad guys will be fine. He seems to use this device to a fault, and his mechanism to make the story unpredictable makes the story even more predictable.     My only complaint from the first book still holds in this book: the evil guys are cunning and intelligent while the good guys hold fast to their idealism. He drags this on till the end. Robb has won victories, sure, but out of shear determination and little cunning (he attacks at night catching the enemy unawares, not necessarily something new but a loosening from his idealism). Robb could have joined forces with Renly, but that would have too quickly ended the battle with the Lannisters so GRR Martin was forced to make him stubborn. The only intelligent good character seems to be Catelyn, but people refuse to listen to her sensibility.    The Lannisters seem to be ever changing, and never still long enough to grasp onto their plans. The only one that seems to be stubborn and bullheaded is Jamie, and he is captured, probably the only thing I was surprised by in this book. But Tywin, Tyrion and Cersei are rarely \\"in trouble\\". Martin goes out of his way to ensure that Tyrion isn't killed; above and beyond what any \\"good\\" guy would be expected. I've come to the conclusion that at some point Tyrion will die, Martin has built up so much anticipation for his death yet never gone through with it. But if he is to live, I wouldn't be surprised because it is only the \\"bad guys\\" that can outwit.    The final battle was an absurd twist of fate and far removed from reality: Twyin coming the Kings Landing's rescue in the knick of time. The absurdity! But again, I can't say I was terriblesurprised by those 10 some pages describing the Lannisters victory, but more buy the absurdity. On top of that, after so little magic throughout the entirety of the first two books the sudden emergence of it from the red priestess' womb is absurd, you would almost think that Stannis is destined for victory, only to send her away and foreshadow his demise. On top of that, Loras Tyrell jumps \\"sides\\" with the promise of a place at the kingsgaurd.     The absurd luck given to the \\"bad\\" made the book less unpredictable, and increasingly dull.    Although, the story is still good and worth the read.
0440242401|4.0|Levi has an accident and when she wakes up, she doesn't remember the last 3 years of her life.  She thinks she's still the fun, party girl she was in her past.  Her best friends don't talk to her anymore and she can't figure out why.  She even has a husband she doesn't remember and a great job she doesn't know how to do.  With everyone's help, she gradually remembers everything but decides she doesn't like the person she had become.  So how does she become a happy person again?<br /><br />Funny, well written plot.  A great chic lit read.<br /><br />FTC disclosure:  I was given this book by a friend.
0553386794|5.0|The last fantasy book I read may have been Harry Potter 5 years ago, so I am no fantasy expert.<br /><br />This book was good, and veered from the tried and true good triumphing over evil (almost too much). I did in enjoy it, and did not have to labor through weighty tome. The characters are well written/described, the world is laid out rather tediously and by half way through the book you think you know what to expect. But plot twist after plot twist arise as the story reaches its, and from there it is difficult to put down.<br /><br />The mechanism GRR Martin uses for the narrative (3rd person limited) for a set of characters builds anticipation like few other books I've read. At times it becomes frustrating.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there seems to be no end to the cunning and intelligence of the \\"evil\\" characters, while the \\"good\\" characters hold fast to their idealism. They are constantly able to out maneuver and out wit the \\"good\\" guys. This isn't necessarily completely off-putting because there are small victories, and I don't mind a darker, more unpredictable story that isn't blatantly good triumph over evil. But his brooding sense of melancholy and cynicism to tend to make the book easily predictable by the end (haven't read the series, but I wont be surprised).<br /><br />All in all, good read and highly recommended, I give it 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of the book, even with the flaws/complaint.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|i just got this cd today and so far it kicks some major ass. this one has alot of the best songs from the 1990's through today. i am glad that they included Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter and Holy Smoke. i would love to see another cd after their latest masterpiece THE FINAL FRONTIER. another great song that they included was SIGN OF THE CROSS which tells of the Second Coming of Christ in all His Glory. i was disappointed that LORD OF THE FLIES and MONSTIGUER and AGE OF INNOCENCE and THE ANGEL AND THE GAMBLER and ISLE OF AVALON weren't on it but since i have all the cd's i can still listen to them. thank you for a kick ass cd and let's see another one soon.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|This has to be Britney's best album yet. Ive been a fan since I was 12 and I am 24 now! Still love her, She still has what it takes. Love the bonus tracks also!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I actually enjoy all the little backround additions GL added into the trilogy, but I just can't get by some of the major changes like Greedo Shooting first and Introducing Jabba in Star Wars.    Greedo shooting first I shouldn't even have to explain.    CG Jabba looks technically terrible, also a bit wimpy (seems to be getting pushed around by Han) and the build up to a great menacing creature is lost by showing him in the 1st movie.   I know I can't pick and choose what to leave in and what to take out, so I would prefer to have the original movies I saw as a kid and that is where my money will go if they are ever released. If not, so be it.    GL can do whatever he wants, but I personally will not be buying this on Blu Ray.
B004FOA84A|3.0|A very short game that most people should be able to finish within an hour, 2 hours maximum. The game only had a couple good puzzles at most and there is absolutely no replay value. Even $1 would be asking too much in my opinion.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Although I saw this from start to finish on Sky Atlantic, I'm really looking forward to the DVD release - and I really hope it comes stuffed with extras.     The times in which this series is set are so fascinating and so filled with incredible characters, that the show it sometimes left with little room to breathe. I mean, you have Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, and Lucky Luciano - and that's just a few of the faces from that era. So, how did they make a TV series that accommodates so many personalities?     Well, they did something smart - they centred the series on little known(to me at least) Nucky Thompson - who centres all the plots and acts as the main protagonist (Steve Buscemi has never been better).     If you didn't catch this series on Sky, make sure you pick it up on DVD. It is spellbinding and the writing is incredible: cliché free and with twists and turns that you won't see coming.
9500426404|1.0|This specific translation or just the version from this seller is or should be a publisher reject.  I HAVE purchased publishing rejects before to save money on textbooks in college.  I was not expecting to get a REJECT and am very disappointed with this.  Be advised - shop elsewhere & buy a different spanish language version.  The main problem with this version is that the book was not properly \\"Cut\\" and so many of the illustrations are chopped off.  Also the text is printed too big and runs into the lines above and below a little.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Towards the end of this film, the plot becomes so confusing and so bizarre you wonder if Christopher Nolan was doing it on purpose to make you feel like you were in a dream. Personally, I thought this film was amazing, but I can understand if others felt a little lost or confused by the film.     The story is not one that can be explained easily, and to be honest I suggest you just rent the movie and give it a go, as I said I think you will either love it or hate it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|5 stars for plants vs zombies on the PC. 2.5 stars for this hack of a port from iOS.    First, as has been pointed out on all the reviews, this is SLOW loading. 45-60 seconds on my Vibrant to start the game from scratch. It also will take 15-30 seconds to reload the game if you are interrupted by a phone call, text message, phone going to sleep, or even the \\"low battery\\" message (which you _will_ get if you play the game for any length of time). That may have been acceptable on iOS3 with limited multitasking capabilities, but Android (and iOS4, for that matter) is designed to allow you to switch between programs without dropping everything. Minus 1 star for not taking the time to optimize for the platform.    Second, you cannot play the quick play until you complete the adventure mode. I've played plants vs zombies on other platforms and I don't want to have to go through the beginning levels to play the quick play. There is no option to skip ahead to the more interesting levels. Minus 1/2 star for poor user interaction there.    Third and most important, this game has lost my save file 3 times. I wouldn't mind playing through the adventure mode once, but I don't want to have to keep repeating the same beginning levels only to lose my place and all my achievements. Minus 1 star for such a frustrating experience.    If I hadn't gotten this on the free app of the day, I'd be extremely irritated instead of just sadly disappointed. If you're considering purchasing this, wait until they fix it before giving them your money.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|This is a fascinating documentary and Matt Damon does a great job at narrating it. The only problem is the length and depth of the film. I think it needed to be a little more simpler as it brings a little too much to the table for the average viewer to digest.     Some the interviews are also a little amateurish, and the film maker seems intent on being a little immature with some of the subjects. Although, this is a delight at times to see such powerful men talked to as if they were criminals - their reactions when attacked are revealed, and they seem incredulous when someone questions their puffed up self regard.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Even though the subject matter may repel some, as the film begins it immediately immerses the viewer into the family life of brothers Thomas and Francisco. The film is fearless and daring in many ways as its touches on some very taboo subject matters. It slowly creeps up to you, but once this drama sees the boys as grown men, it takes a very nostalgic mood. There is a very haunting aspect to this film that will leave you lulled and wanting more. There is also a certain amount of sadness eminent from the fantastic performances from Rafael Cardoso and João Gabriel Vasconcellos. Both these men light up the screen, and their chemistry was incendiary with a very fierce dynamic relationship that takes twists and turns in many directions but ultimately leaves you yearning for what was once between them. The film is pretty much about life changes and how some of the best times are hard to let go as mere memories. Both brothers, in their own way, must deal with life's changes and its unexpectedness. Very poetic and always eloquent in its storytelling, dealing with such difficult subject matter was flawlessly handled sensitively in the very capable hands of Aluisio Abranches. Brazil should be proud to have this film. It represents very well the beautiful people of Brazil, their culture and it give you great insight of a culture that is filled with traditions as well as strong family and community ties.     As the movie beautifully unfolds, we explore and observe a relationships and how difficult it can be to let go of the tie that binds.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|The one flaw of LA Confidential is that it is only three hours long. I almost wish this was a 72 hours series on HBO - it really is that good. Everything here is perfect - the acting, the sets, the atmosphere and most especially the story.     Having been an Elroy fan for years, I was nervous when this adaptation arrived. But all my fears were unfounded. This film actually achieves the impossible - it is better than its source material.     The talent here were all at the top of their game when this film was made: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce and many more. The film almost reads like a who's who of new acting talent of the 90s.
078322737X|5.0|Made in the 70's but set in the 60's, this film still entertains.  I first saw it at age 13 (about 5 times)  when it first came out and now watching it again it reminded me how I was introduced to some incredible music at a young age and how much I wanted to be just like those 16 year olds in the movie!  The soundtrack in particular has stayed me with ever since as one of the best collections of music from the late 50's and early 60's.  I can still remember the order of every song on my cassette.  Most memorable moments with the perfect matches with music include: At The Hop, Green Onions, Smoke Gets In Your Eyes....    Even though nothing radical really happens in the movie, the quality acting, directing and the sharp script together with the music keep you intrigued to the end. And the cars! Wow, how huge were they then! A Smart Car would have fitted in the boot of one.     Yes, It feels like a Hollywood movie with the Hollywood ending, but the journey is a great revisit of a long gone innocent era.  Teenagers seemed so naive then too....  This film will always be in the top 5 movies ever for me and mainly because of the soundtrack. However, it's fascinating to watch it after more than 30 years and see a super young Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford already showing signs of having that 'something' special that has made them all in to the stars that they are now.    A thoroughly wonderful trip down memory lane for anyone who wanted to rollerskate as a waitress or drive a hot rod while listening to Wolf Man Jack play awesome tunes.
1401207529|5.0|Where to begin?     The story is deep, engaging, and amazing - probably my favourite of all the Batman graphic novels.     The art is perfect, it is detailed and interesting and the colouring matches the tone of the artwork perfectly.     The lettering is also great, with the different styles matching the narrative of the character well.     I don't understand what this deluxe edition has added to what was a perfect book, other than that - this is an essential purchase.
B004SS0884|5.0|So I've Wanted To Do This Review For A While Now. It's Been Like Two Mouths Since \\"Femme Fatale\\" Has Been Released.<br /><br />And I Can Say I Think This Is The Awesome Dance Album Ever! From \\"Til The Worlds Ends\\" - \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" Amazing! I Can't Stop Blasting This Album. I Feel Like I'm In My Own Lil Club Dancing To This Ablum.<br /><br />A Lil Disppointed The Track \\"Scary\\" Didnt Make It On The Verison. But All As Well.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: \\"Criminal\\" \\"Trouble for Me\\" \\"Selfish\\" & \\"He About to Lose Me\\" + \\"Scary\\"
B004VUP8WK|5.0|Okay, so here is a track by track review and description:    1. Omni Potens:  Instrumental opener.  Heavily influenced by Laibach's album \\"Macbeth.\\"  Not as good as the inspiration, but still well done.    2. Too Extreme!:  This is a track with a repetitive, pounding beat throughout.  Extremely heavy, this seems like it is meant to be \\"oppressive;\\" think again Laibach, but not with an \\"industrial\\" sound.  I really like this song--it is quite different from your standard death metal track.    3. Existo Vulgare:  Sounds like a track that for some reason didn't make it onto Formulas Fatal to the Flesh.  Excellent traditional Morbid Angel.    4. Blades for Baal:  Same as Existo Vulgare; classic Morbid Angel.  Reminds me a little more of Covenant.  I'm not a musician, so I can only rely on gut feeling rather than describing scales/etc, but I still think this is a very well done song.    5. I Am Morbid:  More classic Morbid Angel, a very sludgy/slimy slower track, but with a slight bit of melody.  The only thing that is really unusual for the band on this track is the refrain \\"morbid,\\" which consists of multiple voices saying the word at the same time so that it sounds like a concert crowd chanting in unison.    6. 10 More Dead:  Sludge and slime again, this one reminds me of Domination or Covenant.  This is standard, classic Morbid Angel.    7. Destructos vs the Earth:  This one has a repetitive, military/martial beat with some clean vocals and spoken vocals, alongside some standard death metal style shouting.  This is standard/classic sludgy Morbid Angel, but with a different drum beat.  The lyrics are cheesy, but if you take death metal seriously then you really need to get a life.    8. Nevermore:  More standard Morbid Angel, something like Covenant or Formulas Fatal to the Flesh.    9. Beauty Meets Beast:  Standard sludgy Morbid Angel, again.    10. Radikult:  Ok, so this is the the track that people tend to really hate because they think that Morbid Angel \\"sold out.\\"  I fail to see how Dave Vincent whispering over a bass guitar and bass drum, along with a repetitive beat elsewhere,  constitutes \\"selling out.\\"  For the most part, this song is traditional Morbid Angel sludge.  This song has about a one-minute Laibach \\"Macbeth\\" style ending.    11. Profundis--Mea Culpa:  This song doesn't really fit on any of their previous albums, but if they were to do an entire album in the style of this song it would be an excellent album instantly recognizable as Morbid Angel.  Fast and aggressive death metal.    I think this is an excellent album.  While they have certainly added some new elements, this is still 100% Morbid Angel and very traditional in many ways.  I feel that their new elements really expand their sound, and that their traditional sounding tracks are very well written.  The old and the new blends together nicely.  I really enjoyed this album and am happy to see David back on vocals, and am excited to hear what they will do in the future.    I think a lot of the haters can't see the forest for the trees--they focus only on those few things that are different and because of that they lose sight of the rest of the album.  After almost 20 years of listening to extreme metal, this is one aspect of the extreme metal scene that I have really come to despise--it is so darn conservative and narrow-minded.  Music (or any art for that matter) has never improved by producing the same thing over and over again.  The past has passed.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I haven't heard of Adele before this album. I listened to one of her songs from this album on NPR and decided to buy the album after sampling all the songs here on Amazon. Boy was I blown away. What a great voice she has got. Beautiful, Peaceful, Soulful. Ineffable. This is the first album in years that I listened to without skipping a single song. That says something.<br /><br />I sincerely hope she doesn't go the Lady GaGa route and waste her talent. We need singers like Adele.<br /><br />If you are like me who likes good lyrics and a soulful music, buy this album. You won't regret.<br /><br />PS: Listen to this album form start to finish without interruption. That's when you feel it and the feeling stays with you for hours after that.
0439813786|3.0|I purchased this book because of the excellent illustrations. I was somewhat disappointed by the story. For me it lacked that magical quality that convinces the reader the author truly inhabits the world he has created. As a children's story the subject seemed to be too \\"adult.\\" As a story for adults, it wasn't mature or complex enough. There was mystery, chases, a discovery, and yes, history but what one craved from the build up was something akin to the tapping or the \\"open sesame\\" that yes, as in Harry Potter opens onto something seemingly new, before unseen, that is slowly, carefully unfolded and discovered. Even after the truths were \\"out\\" I felt there was a story that had not been told. What couldn't have been told of such an inventor?! But the dry facts of the tale took hold and there the story expired. There is a verbal form of drawing that had not been fully executed. Too bad the germ of the narrative was not given the same attention as given to the sequence of illustrations. Medal or no medal: Three stars--for the illustrations.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Bought this album soon after the release , love it . The more I listen to it the better it gets. On another note I pre-ordered BCC-2 and to my surprise when I checked the mail Monday June 6th it was in the box a full week before the release date. If you liked the first one you will surely like the second  one.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|really useful to view available networks, signal strength, and channels. when i setup a wifi network, i check what channel has the least traffic (+/-1 on each side) and use that. been using this app for over a year. thumbs up.
B004TB6GUY|5.0|Totally Kickass! Best Acoustic Album this year! Can be considered habit forming! And no \\"Parental Advisory Sticker\\" so you can turn your kids onto Black Label Society!....SDMF4Ever!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|The gameplay is almost exactly the same as on the PC which is great! The game plays even better than I was expecting with a touch interface.<br /><br />On my stock Samsung Vibrant with Android 2.2 (Froyo) the first problem I ran into was that upon tapping the home button none of my icons were there. Eventually they came back but it was quite irritating having to wait that long.<br /><br />The second, and more frustrating in my opinion, is that my game profile was erased somewhere into the third zone. I restarted from scratch in the hope that it was a one time irregularity. As a precaution I created a second profile and switch to it when I need to exit. My hope is that if it loses a profile again it'll be the active one.<br /><br />If these issues were fixed the game would qualify for a full 5 stars.
0312323867|5.0|A very enjoyable read. If you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere, but if you really want a heartfelt, feel-good quick read, this chick flick sequel is for you. =)
B004G6009K|5.0|if we have watched this once.. we have watched this 100 times.. lol.. i have a three yr old. this is her favorite movie.. i love the 3d.. and this package is the best because it come with every disk you could need.. it is just great!!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Our PlayStation 3 came with one controller and this was a great addition for a great price!  Long lasting and fun to use!
075640407X|4.0|If you're like me and are not a big Fantasy Fiction fan, you might be hesitating to purchase \\"The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)\\" and \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two.\\"<br /><br />Usually I ignore the fantasy genre, but I was looking for a long, inexpensive book in which I could immerse myself. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was on sale, highly rated and, at almost 700 pages, it fulfilled my totally non-literary criterion.<br /><br />That was my intro to Rothfuss' fantasy series and I was immediately hooked. Remarkably likable characters, great descriptive writing and a not too crazy plot drew me in and helped me burn a couple days house sitting in Nowhere Colorado. I bought Day 2 right away.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed Day 1, \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two\\" proved to be an even better read. Series aka franchises usually have little appeal to me. Rothfuss' is my exception and I can only hope he's at work pounding out Day 3.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|overall i liked the book. i liked savannah at first but grew to hate her after what she did to john. not a satisfying ending and because of that it gets 3 stars. i liked most of the characters like john and his dad. if you like heartbreaking romance buy this book.
B003UESJEM|4.0|I usually do not review movies (in fact this may be my first), but I found this movie insighful as I work for a large company and have seen people of all different ages and backgrounds let go.  This movie is about coming to grips with a new reality that jobs will be hard to find and how important it is for this country to innovate and create more in the white space.     The Craig T Nelson character was brutally honest, especially when he said his job is to run the company.  He had many forces pulling him in the wrong direction as their company, like many in the US, are based on old business models and had to make changes.      The movie had some cliches in it, but I think they were needed to make the point of excess and greed and how quickly or how fragile many wealthy people in our country really are if faced with a crisis or lengthy umemployment.  The Ben Affleck character went through a great transformation that many people need to embrace (i.e. having real conversations with your kids, saying no sometimes, and setting up a budget for your household).      The movie is a good character study of a business in transition that was impacted heavily by this recession, but who still has to answer to stockholders.  This movie should resonate with many (hint: the movie is not only about rich people struggling).
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've been testing this case out for a week and I can say with brutal honesty that Amazon makes some strong competitors with their AmazonBasics line.<br />If you're looking for a \\"basic\\" case for your iPhone 4 that offers just general protection, this is it.  It's not exactly drop-proof as it is, after all, a thin, soft silicon layer, but it gets the job done.  I have a very similar case ([[ASIN:B003QP423M Amzer Luxe Argyle High Gloss TPU Soft Gel Skin Case for iPhone 4 (Smoke Grey) (Fits AT&T iPhone)]]) that was $3 more when I purchased it, and the AmazonBasics is just as good with the exception of covering the buttons and the Apple logo on back.  I was a bit worried that since it doesn't cover ANY of the buttons it would become a problem, but so far so good.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />The case does have some sharper edges than the Amzer's rounded ones, but it hasn't become a problem yet.  In fact, it actually adds some grip when I play Angry Birds!  I let my father use my phone once and he complained that the case hurt his ear, but I haven't experienced any problems yet myself.<br /><br />AmazonBasics is just that: basic accessories made and sent from Amazon.  If you want a generic case that will save your phone from a small drop, look no further.  If you expect to drop your iPhone from a three-story building without any issues however, then you need a different case.  Or a slap in the face.  Either or.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|I knew a lot of fans were going to slam this album but I actually really dig the industrial sounds Morbid Angel is doing on this disc. There is still  mostly the Morbid trademark riffing (Tim Yeung of Divine Heresy is on drums for Pete Sandoval & of course slays!) & Dave Vincent returns with the monsterous voice but on the beginning & end of the album has some industrial tunes to give a little taste of something new & refreshing! Sorry but I like a lot of types of metal so I am not against this & I am really surprised at how well this album came out...nice job Trey, Dave & company!
B000SGSU58|5.0|other than michael connelly, victor methos, and thomas harris, i don't really read mysteries. but this book was amazing. it held my attention from start to finish and gave me a glimpse of worlds i know nothing about (he describes the world of adult films in alot of detail). the characters were all developed and realistic and it had a darkness to it that just seemed like what it would be like to be a lapd homicide detective. some people gave it some negative reviews but some people give everything negative reviews. don't listen to them. i highly recommend this book.
B004QSQML8|4.0|I've had a love-hate relationship with \\"Legend\\" since first viewing it as a pre-teen. On the one hand, it is visually resplendent and features Tim Curry in a knock-out performance as one of the screen's best representations of the Lord of Darkness. On the other, the plot is threadbare, the comic relief characters are utterly juvenile and annoying, and Tom Cruise's Jack is nothing more than a stock character -- even his name is generic.    I had purchased and loved and then loathed and sold the Ultimate Edition DVD several years ago, but because of the film's lush aesthetics and the high visual fidelity of Blu-ray, I decided to give this disc a chance.    Upon reflection, especially after a recent viewing prior to this review, it seems that a person's enjoyment of the film is largely dependent on what that person brings to their viewing. It has been some time since I have viewed the Theatrical Cut in its entirety, but regarding Ridley Scott's preferred Director's Cut, I have found that the film works best by treating it as an \\"art film\\" in the vein of Jean Cocteau's \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" a reference that Scott points to in the extras, and focusing on the gorgeous designs, William Hjortsberg's poetic dialogue, and -- rather than the lackluster plot and characterizations -- the Freudian subtexts woven throughout: the obsession over the power of the unicorn's horn, Darkness appearing out of Lily's reflection, his muscular, engorged red form with his own gigantic horns... you get the idea. In this manner, the film becomes less an underwhelming adventure and more of a fable regarding Lily's sexual awakening and the struggle between pure love and insatiable lust. This interpretation isn't perfect, but IMHO it creates a more satisfying and interesting viewing experience than taking the film at face value.    Regarding the Blu-ray itself, both the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut are presented in entirely separate transfers. Scott provides textual disclaimers before either version. While at first glance the Theatrical Version appears sharper and more colorful, I found this look to be oversaturated and could indeed detect some edge enhancement. The Director's Cut is far more natural (and classy) in the tone of its colors, as well as still providing an awesome level of detail in the elaborate sets; minor specks of print damage do pop up from time to time on this version, so it isn't pristine, but it is still extraordinary to look at. And, while both versions offer DTS-HD audio, the Director's Cut has received a superior mix -- Darkness's rich basso voice will resonate throughout your home. Special features are nearly identical to the Ultimate Edition DVD, minus the DVD-ROM content. Regardless of version, this Blu-ray is a substantial upgrade in fidelity.    To sum up, this is a spectacular disc for a not-quite-so-spectacular film. If you're new to the film, I would definitely consider a viewing before making a purchase, but if you have fond memories of \\"Legend,\\" this Blu-ray will be highly regarded in your collection.
0316098329|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Finished it in one day. It's great!   P.S. I would put six stars if I could.
0061726826|5.0|I'll admit up front that although this is a YA book, I'm a thirty-something and I thought this book was amazing. I was glued to each page.  The writing was beautiful, the characters were well-developed, and the story was perfectly tragic.  I absolutely cannot wait for the next book in the series to come out. I would say this book would be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of the curren YA trend (Twilight, Hunger Games, etc).
B002IR3PSC|1.0|you only get 5 songs worth of video. this could have been just a cd release with some bonus video footage. but instead you get to pay 20 dollars.  who's in charge around here anyway, and did tull approve of this?  but i gotta admit- it's a heck of a cd.
B00474IVGA|2.0|I bought this cd and I was disappointed that it didnt contain the original songs. I had to buy the more songs from Country Strong.  Faith Hill has other songs that she is good in but Give in to Me is not one of them. What a let down.  Garret is amazing; all of the songs he sang, cant seem to get them out of my head.  Country music songs are not my most favorite type of songs to listen to but Garrett Hudlum and Gwyneth Paltrow could easily change that.  What a talented woman Gwyneth Paltrow is, such a pleasant surprise.  I hope to see more songs performed by both of these talented people.

0802798225|4.0|This is not your usual YA romance book. There is a lot of issues that are addressed in this book. Alex is a member of a Latino gang who is smart and loyal to his friends and family. Brittany is the beautiful, \\"perfect\\" girl that everybody loves. The two are forced to be partners in Chemistry class and while at first they hate each other, they begin to realize that they have more in common than they realized.<br /><br />One of the things I liked most about this book was the importance that was placed on not just looking at the outside appearances of someone and making judgements on that appearance. Alex is a character with lots of different layers. He is the tough gang member, the loyal friend, a father figure to his two younger brothers, and a good student that pretends he is not as smart as he is. Brittany looks like she has it all from the outside but from the beginning we see her struggling with many different issues mainly dealing with her family. She is never shown as shallow or mean-spirited, but as intelligent and genuinely concerned for others, especially her sister.<br /><br />The love story between Alex and Brittany was well written and fun to read. The book showed them dealing with real life issues that are not easily resolved. I really liked how Elkeles ended the book, it was a good ending for two very likable characters.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I use this cable for playing music on my home stereo system and it works great.  It will even play videos and movies on the big screen and with better than expected video quality. It cost me several dollars more to rent movies via pay per view and am really considering renting movies through iTunes to watch my movies on the big 47\\" HD TV that I have, it is that good.  It is a little spendy for the pocket book, but am very happy with the results I am getting from this cable system for my iPhone. It works really good on my daughter's iPod 3G also, and the video quality from it is really good.

From start to finish, this one should have you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next thing to happen. I really thought the nun masks were creepy looking.   Ben Affleck seems to be in the shape of his life. He is such a strong character in this film. Convincingly capable of being a gentle character and the hard liner.   If you're an action fan, this is a must see. You will not be dissappointed. A+

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|So I ordered this thing as an upgrade from an AMD Athlon II X3 440 @ 3.0 GHz. The triple-core is a great processor, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't enough to keep up with my EVGA GTX 460 SSC+, so I looked into the Thuban. One main reason for getting the 1090t was the price. A six-core processor under $200? That's a steal. Of course it's not going to be as good as Intel's Core i7-990X, but have you priced that? The 1090t is for consumers who are unable to afford $1,000 processors, but want the same, or close, performance from high-priced products.<br /><br />This thing can handle anything you throw at it and some more. For gaming, this is more than enough to keep up with any of the latest games. I have yet to find a game that I am unable to play at high or ultra high settings. The few games that do push the 1090t would be Crysis and Metro 2033, but they are known to push your build. Also, gaming depends on the graphics card you have as well, so I may be holding back the Thuban from its full potential. As far as editing goes, the 1090t can render videos like it's nothing. I can render a 5-minute long, 720p video in less than 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great processor for a low price, and now that the Bulldozers are going to be released soon, you can bet on the Phenom II six-cores to drop in price, so make sure you pick one of these up.<br /><br />One other thing, the 1090t with its stock cooler may be a little noisy to some people, but if you're playing games, listening to music, or have headphones on, it's not a big deal and is nothing to worry about. If the computer is idle, you can hear the fan a little, but it's nothing a little music couldn't fix. Although when you're gaming or doing some heavy processing, that's where the stock fan can be quite annoying. So if having a super quiet PC is your thing, make sure to look into more quiet after-market coolers or liquid cooling.<br /><br />My setup:<br /><br />Case: AZZA Hurrican 2000<br />Motherboard: Asus M4A88TC-M<br />Processor: AMD Phenom II X6 1090t Black Edition (3.2 GHz, for now)<br />Graphics Card: EVGA GTX 460 SSC+<br />Hard Drive: Seagate Barracuda 1.5 TB (500 GB + 1 TB)<br />Power Supply: Thermaltake 600W<br />RAM: Corsair 4GB DDR3 (1600 MHz)<br />DVD Drive: LG 24Xs M4A88TC-M  Processor: AMD Phenom II X6 1090t Black Edition (3.2 GHz, for now)  Graphics Card: EVGA GTX 460 SSC+  Hard Drive: Seagate Barracuda 1.5 TB (500 GB + 1 TB)  Power Supply: Thermaltake 600W  RAM: Corsair 4GB DDR3 (1600 MHz)  DVD Drive: LG 24X
B004G6009U|4.0|The 3D Blu Ray Tangled is an eye popping experience.  The amazing colors, details and depth of the animation bring the characters and sets to life like no 2D movie can. The story and music hold up to the best of Disney animation, like the Little Mermaid and Aladdin, but doesn't quite reach the heights of Beauty and the Beast.    I'd almost give it 5 stars, but some will find the special features underwhelming and do people really need 4 discs of the same movie? Tangled probably won't make anyone run out and buy a 3D TV, but I'm glad this was my first 3D BD DVD purchase.

1597801585|2.0|I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled on this one.  I bought the book based on the Hugo award and all the glowing reviews on Amazon.  Honestly, I do not understand all the praise.    On the plus side, Bacigalupi's writing is very evocative.  As a Westerner who has lived in the Third World for many years I know that Bacigalupi's description of the winner-take-all economy that inspires a deep and pervasive culture of corruption and greed is dead on.  The places in the book are beutifully described, and the inner lives of the characters are rich and nuanced.    Unfortunately, none of this makes up for a book that doesn't seem to know what it is about and has no clear story arc.  It is OK to have a book whose point is all about having no clear or satisfying story.  However, if the author is going to write such a book it had better be clear that nihilism is the point.  Otherwise a lack of a clear story or central theme feels like muddled thinking by the author.      This book feels like it has too many points, and none made well.  Is the book a cautionary tale of what the world might face if global climate change goes unchecked?  If so, that message gets lost in the story of corruption and greed.  Is is a cautionary tale of a world ruled by unaccountable corporations?  Is it about the risks of gene manupulation and Genetically Modified Foods?  Is it about the corrupt nature of man and the futility of noble actions and sentiment?  It is impossible to tell.    Finally, the \\"sci-fi\\" premises fail.  Science fiction can be an effective medium for allegory, but it must remain plausible to work.  The Windup Girl is full of absurdities.  Apparently set in a post-fossil fuel world.  Whether because of a lack of fossil fuels, global climate change, or biological warfare, the world is full of famine and grain crops are failing everywhere. Yet the go to engines for work are giant mutant elephants?  How can a world with failing grain crops rely on a ruminant for energy?      Springs as a store of energy?  Ok, I get that pre-stored energy in the form of hydrocarbons no longer exist. Why would springs be beter than chemical energy stores like batteries or even hidrogen?  Put energy into water to split hydrogen from oxygen.  Energy is stored in the unstable hydrogen molecule that is non-toxic, light weight, and portable.  Combine the hydrogen with oxygen to relese engergy.  The issue for hydrogen is that it is not pre-loaded with energy like fossil fuels, but neither are elephants.  No \\"dung\\", no need to use feed crops, etc.      Japanese culturing humans because their population is low?  I thought the whole world's population had crashed in this book.  Plus, the Japanese are only going to have a problem of top-heavy population for one generation.  Once the larger older population dies off, the smaller younger population will be in balance again.  How could the Japanese face this same problem hundreds of years in the future?    In short, the Windup Girl is a collection of beautifully rendered scenes and characters but fails as a novel. It lacks cohesion, a well defined story arc, and plausible sci-fi premises.
0316098329|1.0|This had so much hype and did not live up to it. Both my sister and I read it and found it boring. At first you're amazed that the author can capture the voice of a 5-year-old so well, but after about thirty pages you've had enough. There isn't enough plot to hold your interest, and when the author finally moves the location of the story away from the room, it's not that much more exciting either. I think the thing I found most offensive was the emphasis on breastfeeding and Jack's wanting \\"it\\" or \\"the left one\\" or \\"the right one.\\" After saying that fifty or a hundred times, don't you think a reader would tire of it? And he is 5 years old!  This is a terrible, dull, and depressing book. Don't read it.
0316056863|3.0|Regarding content, I abolutely loved the book!  A laugh on every page!    BUT...I am quite disappointed in the Kindle version:  Footnotes are not on the page, but added at the end, which is not useful.  There is a chart in the book and also pages of a script that are reproduced and completely unreadable, even if typesize is increased to maximum.  Buy the print version, not the Kindle version.   I hope Amazon figures out a way to improve the Kindle reading experience.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I find myself playing this game quite a lot. It is fun. The levels are short so it is good for when I have 5min or so to kill.

Usually when I get free games I play them a few times and then get bored with them, but I have played this one quite a lot and am still enjoying myself.

B002ZG993Q|1.0|oh my goodness!   How painfully boring! The 'meat' of the movie could be told in 5 maybe 10 minutes, but to add time to make a movie it seemed they chose to add one incredibly painful, long, exaggerated traveling shot after another, as well as the incredibly slow, painful shots of 'building a gun, picking out tools' etc.! UGH!    Added to all this, there were no characters one could care about. Filled with cliche's, like the prostitute who dreamed of meeting a rich man to take her away from it all.    I watched to the end to see if there might be a twist or some punch added, but it stayed a completely, painfully boring movie to the very, very end!
B000002JR8|4.0|I often describe Far Beyond Driven as flawed perfection.  They took the grooving yet extreme direction on Vulgar Display and gave it the right amount of disgust and extremity that album lacked, and ensconsed it in an accessible outer layer of shrewd musicianship and tight composition.  The opener \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" with it's storming riff and menacing and simplistic breakdown must have been some sort of personal ode to Anselmo's battle with his newly bustling hard drug addictions, in fact this album as a whole is littered with lyrics referencing his inability to cope with the hold the drugs had begun to take upon him.  \\"Becoming\\" is almost a nu-metal song at heart with it's nasty groove and tasty pinch squealing that leads into a narcotic Phil echoing an infectious chorus.  \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" takes the choppy stop start riffing and throws in some Black Sabbath like string bends, truly a mesmerizing track.  And speaking of Black Sabbath, they pay homage with an excellent version of \\"Planet Caravan\\", that I must admit begrudgingly that I enjoy more then the original.  \\"Use My Third Arm\\" finds Pantera at their most aggressive and hate filled, with some truly brilliant lyrics by Phil.  \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\" may just be the real gem of this album with it's slow methodical riff and and catchy chorus.  They clearly had a purpose with this album and it was not to remain content with the success they were having with previous output.  Indeed flawed this album is, because despite how strong the material is as a whole, the filler on this album is ever present, and among the worst of their career.  \\"Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills\\" is neither scary nor intense, rather laughable actually, might even qualify as the low point of their career.  \\"Throes of Rejection\\" has Phil complaining about his genital size with a stagnant riff and chorus and  \\"25 Years\\" is a complete waste of time.  \\"Shedding Skin\\" is another low point which finds Phil rambling in his talking voice until Dime saves him with a guitar solo that gives the track a barely less then flaccid rating.  This album is schizophrenic in quality, but that's what the skip button is for.  As a whole, I highly rec this album to extreme metal veterans and newcomers alike.ce until Dime saves him with a guitar solo that gives the track a barely less then flaccid rating.

B000002IV8|3.0|I Hear Black finds Overkill fully embracing the groove and with mixed results.  I don't find this album to be some sort of bandwagon album as some might suggest, I do see a departure in the thrashing sound they had prior to this.  It might be easy to forget that in 1993 Overkill were not quite living in the same musical landscape they had when Years of Decay was released.  Most people don't quite understand how dependent upon Metallica's coattails the thrash scene really was.  They didn't quite sell out, they just attempted to stay relevant, and in hindsight who can blame them.  \\"Dreaming In Columbian\\" and \\"Feed My Head\\" groove you into the ground and breath a breath of fresh air into the sometimes stagnant air that bands like Overkill breath.  I find this to be a somewhat entertaining album, if not largely irrelevant.  It should be noted that a good portion of the songs have a tendency to groove nowhere fast, making my rating of a three somewhat generous.  But when they succeed, they succeed in glory.  Thinking of \\"Spiritual Void\\" as a prime example, it grooves, it pounds, and it's catchy.  Maybe the band could have gone somewhere with this sound had they gotten better at it, but they felt an overwhelming need to release the same thrash album over and over again after their one failed experimentation.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a great game.  However, it reboots way too often!  I was able to get through the first 6-7 levels fine.  Then the rebooting starting happening more and more frequently.  Hopefully there will be a fix soon.

B0006GQMC8|4.0|\\"Death Hunt\\" is a 1981 film about the hunt for a wanted fugitive across the vast Canadian frontier. Lee Marvin leads the posse in pursuit of a trapper played by Charles Bronson. The film is loosely based on a real event that took place in 1931. It was previously filmed as \\"The Mad Trapper\\" (1972) and as \\"Challenge to be Free\\" (1975).<br /><br />The film examines two aging men facing a changing landscape and caught in a confrontation. Such themes have been addressed before in films like \\"Ride the High Country\\" (1952) and \\"The Good Guys and the Bad Guys\\" (1969).<br /><br />Charles Bronson (1921-2003) is best known for his \\"Death Wish\\" films, but these were merely a handful of the more than 150 films he made over a 50 year career that stretched from 1949 to 1999 and included such memorable films as \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" (1960), \\"The Great Escape\\" (1963), \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" (1967), \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" (1968), and \\"The Valachi Papers\\" (1972). In 1972 the Golden Globes named him the World's Favorite Male Actor. Here at age 60 Bronson manages to do an excellent job portraying the aging yet still skillful trapper<br /><br />Lee Marvin (1924-87) gave us 4 decades of tough guys, from \\"The Big Heat\\" (1953) and \\"The Wild One\\" (1953) to \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" (1962) and \\"The Killers\\" (1964) to \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" (1967) and \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" (1968) to \\"The Big Red One\\" (1980) and his final film \\"Delta Force\\" (1986). Along the way he picked up an Oscar for \\"Cat Ballou\\" (1965). Most of Marvin's films were westerns, and to some extent, this one is too. Marvin does a good job as the weary Mountie called upon once more to action.<br /><br />FWIW - Marvin was top billed in \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" in 1967, but in 1981 Bronson got the lead spot.<br /><br />Sexy Angie Dickinson (1931) has a small part as a love interest for Marvin. She appeared with Marvin in \\"The Killers\\" (1964) and in \\"Point Blank\\" (1967), with Marlon Brando in \\"The Chase\\" (1966), with Frank Sinatra in \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" (1960), and with John Wayne in \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959). Perhaps her most memorable film role was in Dressed to Kill\\" (1980), and she is probably best known for her TV series \\"Police Woman\\" (1974 - 1978) for which she was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe 3 times. She won the Golden Globe in 1960 (Most Promising Newcomer) and 1975 (\\"Police Woman\\").<br /><br />Andrew Stevens (1955) plays a newly initiated Mountie and member of the posse. Stevens is an actor, producer, and director, and has appeared in more than 50 films and produced more than 100. His acting debut was \\"The Boys in Company C\\" (1978) for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. He is the son of actress Stella Stevens.<br /><br />Carl Weathers (1948) is best remembered for his role as Apollo Creed in the \\"Rocky\\" films and has also been in action films like \\"Force 10 from Navarone\\" (1978) and \\"Predator\\" (1987). He had his own series on TV (\\"Street Justice\\") from 1991-3 and 1993-5 (\\"In the Heat of the Night\\"). Weathers is a long time friend of Marvin and joins the posse.<br /><br />The other members of the posse include such familiar character actors as Ed Lauter (guard from \\"The Longest Yard\\"), William Sanderson (Other brother Larry from \\"Newhart\\"), Maury Chaykin (Incontinent Colonel in \\"Dances with Wolves\\") , and Sean McCann (John Mitchell in \\"The Pentagon Papers\\").<br /><br />The thrill in films like these (e.g., \\"Naked Prey\\", \\"The Chase\\", \\"Tell Them Willie Boy is Here\\", \\"Rambo: First Blood\\") is whether or not the protagonist will escape and just how many people will be killed in the attempt.<br /><br />Director Peter Hunt (1925-2002) is best known for his work on a series on James Bond films in which he was an editor (\\"Dr. No\\", \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"Thunderball\\") and later a director (\\"You Only Live Twice\\", On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\"). In addition he directed \\"Shout at the Devil\\" (1976) and \\"Wild Geese 2\\" (1985). It was Hunt's work in the snow-capped mountains in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" that won him the job for this film.<br /><br />All things considered this is a compelling film. We're offered Canada in the early 1930s when radio and air pursuit are being introduced yet where at the end of the day, it is the experience and skill of the Mountie that will carry the day. And we have the match off between two aging highly competent foes, forced by circumstances into a confrontation neither of them wants.d this is a compelling film.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|There's nothing new, spectacular or surprising going in 'Shelter.' In fact, the story has been put on screen many times before. Guy finds out he is gay, has trouble in accepting that for himself and his surrounding, but in the end everything turns out the way it should. Pretty thin story. Maybe especially for a Dutch guy like me. But the acting and the storyline are believable. And the actors are nice people, what makes it easy to sympathise with them. So yes, it's a cliché. But a well done one.    I also liked the music in the movie very much. The Shane Mack songs as well as most of the others. That helps too.    This movie came without subtitles. And that's a dissapointment for those who can't hear very well and for those who don't understand english well enough. And that's a shame. It witholds the movie from being seen by many people across this planet. Also those, to whom this story isn't so much of a cliché, but a story they live themselves.

B004UQPM4E|5.0|Finally, the original Superman series hits Blu ray.  I still don't get why this didn't happen way back in 2006 when the dvd set came out.  All we got were a poor transfer of the extended version of the first film, a great transfer of the Donner Cut of part 2, and a fairly poor transfer of Superman Returns.  Here we get 'em all, plus they are all new transfers from the previous releases making it beyond worth picking up.<br /><br />All, and I mean ALL, the special features from the previous dvd set is included in this eight blu ray disc box set.  Now maybe someone out there can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't recall, on the box set dvd or the blu ray, the previous releases of Superman Returns having the deleted scene of Superman returning the barron and destroyed planet Krypton searching for life in his crystal spaceship.  I've never seen this five minutes sequence before in my life.  I've only seen snippets of it on the theatrical trailers for the film.  Well, I got to see it for the first time today.  While Returns is no great film, this scene should have been left in.  It would've opened the film up more.  Even weirder is this scene is completely finished.  All the effects are GREAT and finished and polished.  I can't believe they cut this scene.  Hell, there were even action figures made of Superman's space suit and his ship back in 2006 for a sequence that was never even seen by mainstream film goers.  Whatever.  All the other deleted scenes and extended cuts are here too. All the films have their commentaries included, except Returns which never had one unfortunately.<br /><br />Of course some of the special features are repetitive.  The commentaries repeat some of the info give in the featurettes and documentaries.  Back in 2001 a box set for the first four films was released on dvd.  Only the first film had special features and an extended cut.  The documentary, cut into three parts, is included.  While this doc repeats a lot of what is on the eighth disc's featurettes regarding the whole series' history, it does skim over the on set tensions and the firing of Richard Donner from the directing duties of part 2.  So, essentially, if you're a hardcore fan like me, you will have to view both.  We get the first feature film of Superman starring George Reeves called Superman and the Mole Men, not really in HD unfortunately.  Even better is we the classic animated shorts from Fleischer studios.  They're not cleaned up but they look pretty good in a low grade version of hi def.  The audio of all movies has been upgraded and it reall shows.<br /><br />Shockingly to me, is that the AWFUL Superman IV: The Quest for Peace looks really good in hi def.  I mean, it never looked that good, and all the edges of the effects always showed, but the blu ray transfer doesn't make them MORE apparent, but the colors look good.  Go figure.  My favorite part of the part IV disc is the deleted scenes.  Now these scenes make the film seem more whole and help it make a ton more sense, especially towards the third act, but the movie stilled would've been just as awful.  It just would've been a comprehensible mess as opposed to what it is.  I also appreciate co-screenwriter Mark Rosenthal committing a commentary to this disc, as well as an interview for the 8th disc docs.  He is frank and never once tries to polish this turd that he worked on.  He's the only one from this film that even bothered to comment, so I more than appreciate it.  Something about filmmakers talking about movies that didn't work always intrigues me more than the ones that do, just see the Joel Schumacher commentary for Batman and Robin.  Superman Returns FINALLY looks the way it should.  The colors pop and the sound booms.  All previous dvd and blu ray versions of this film were terrible, and even more so when you see the new disc, which kept all the previous releases special features and included the video diaries which were an exclusive to the Superman tin from 2006.<br/><br />Finally, the last thing I'll mention, is Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut.  This is the best special feature ever made for any movie ever made in the history of movies.  I'm super happy that Warner Brothers paid to have this experiment made, that Donner cared enough to give it a whirl, and that it was worth watching.  Most people who initially reviewed this movie just DIDN'T GET IT.  It wasn't a complete representation of Donner's vision for Superman II.  Most people complained that it had the same ending as the first film.  Well, if you bothered to listen to the commentary or watch the doc that accompanies the disc you would know that they were behind while shooting both films back to back, and decided to hedge their bets and not assume that Superman: The Movie would be an instant hit.  They stole the ending from part II and stuck it on the first film.  Since Donner never got to make part II he has no ending to put but the one that was scripted when he was making the film over thirty years ago.  So this is more of an experiment than a competition for the theatrical Lester version.  This is as close to Donner's movie as we'll ever get.  Personally, I loved it.  The screen test footage sticks out like a sore thumb, the acting and writing is GREAT, and Superman's reveal to Lois is clever and fun, as opposed to the dumb Lester version of Clark tripping into a fire.  If you watch the doc or listen to the commentary you will understand what shots were all Donner stuff.  If you have a keen eye for film you'll now anyway.  The effects work and photography and choreography for Donner's footage is sooooo much more graceful and classy.  While his films have goofy humor, the villains from Krypton are played straight and malevolent, unlike the Lester version.  Now I don't hate the Lester version.  It's enjoyable, but an obvious step down in tone and quality from the first film.  It will forever be the offical sequel due to Donner never having filmed or even been give the opportunity to come up with a third act.  Now the only annoyance of the Donner cut for me, beyond the reused end of the first film, is that the middle section is very choppy.  The scenes that cut between the alien invasion and Superman and Lois falling further in love are harshly edited and don't always breath enough.  That's it.  Donner reveals much bitterness regarding not having stayed on board for all the Superman movies, but he seems jovial all the time.  I'm happy he was able to get some closure, and really happy that fans like me could have such a neat gift.  It's also bittersweet in the sense that the Donner cut shows so much potential it makes you feel slighted regarding what he eventually got with the series and the downward spiral it took.<br /><br />All discs are upgraded in audio and visuals so for any Superman fan it's a no brainer.  This is an upgrade.  Now I understand if you don't care to own the later films, but you will have to wait as I'm sure they will all be released individually just like the Batman films.  This will probably happen to coincide with the release of Zach Snyder's upcoming Superman film next year.  I'm hoping the next Superman film is truly just a tale of Superman and NOT another origin story.  It's been done in the comics, movies, cartoons, and tv shows.  NO MORE.  Who doesn't know Superman's origins at this point.  I will be very bored if that's the case.  We'll see.  Fingers crossed.ng I'll mention, is Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre when it opened. The auditorium was packed and people seemed to love it. They were laughing through out the film and even applauded at it's conclusion. I didn't see any religious zealots storming out offended. I enjoyed it enough to want to add it to my private collection, which is why I came on Amazon. At first I was startled by the number of 1 star reviews until I understood that the movie reviews had become a forum for Christian and Atheist debate. Any how entertaining they are. Although very reminiscent of the \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" blogging that acompanies a lot of political news stories.<br /><br />So apparently Paul succeeded on many levels. In addition to being entertaining and funny it also appears to have sparked passion and debate. Isn't that what great films do? That said, I can understand that if you have strong Christian beliefs, this movie might offend. Apparently enough so that some have written strong lengthy diatribes denouncing it. If you fit into this category, then avoid this film at all costs. However if you have enjoyed these film maker's prior efforts or just enjoy irreverent humor, then this film is a gem. Lastly, if you have strong opinions on either side of the fence, view it, love or hate it, and log in and attack those with opposing views. It's awesome when a film inspires such passion.
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|As somebody else had mentioned in a review, Lady Gaga's image and gimmick suggests that her music should be edgier and darker, or as edgy and dark, as her \\"avant-garde\\" fashion statements. I like what she's going for with it, but the music she delivers is just flat and lackluster, bolstered by more hype and crazy costumes than substance.<br /><br />The thing that makes it more irritating is that Lady Gaga IS talented, she has the voice, she has the stage presence, and the creativity to really produce amazing pieces of pop music. She can create a great hit single, but not a fabulous album. Her albums feel to me like they're filled with filler, with the best songs being the singles we've already heard on the radio and one or two hidden gems that truly showcase her vocals and piano skills. The Fame Monster is no different. I only liked 4/8 songs on the album (Bad Romance, Speechless, Dance in the Dark, and Teeth). Bad Romance is just a great pop dance song. Speechless is a surprise gem that really showcases her talent; it makes me wish that she did more music like this instead of relying so heavily on the overproduced, over saturated techno and electric sound that drowns out her voice in 95% of her songs. I liked the sound of Dance in the Dark; my only complaint about it is that I wish she could stop with the whole religious undertones, not because it's offensive or even shocking, but because it comes off as a cheap attempt at trying to be \\"edgy\\" a la Madonna, plus the religious undertone is just unnecessary (and lately, with Born This Way, it's starting to become a cheap crutch). Teeth was just fun and cheeky. The rest of the songs on The Fame Monster were either completely forgettable and useless (Monster, So Happy I Could Die), annoying (Telephone), or cheesy (Alejandro. Sorry, it sounds like a rip off of Madonna's La Isla Bonita). Sometimes I couldn't help but feel that some of her songs sound a little too similar to Madonna, which further makes Lady Gaga seem less of an artist and instead a wannabe, imitation of artists she admires.<br /><br />I don't love this record as much as other people did. I think The Fame better showcased her talent, creativity, and yes, even the over the top gimmick of being an over the top \\"fame hungry\\" monster, worked to her benefit, but it was done in such a creative, fun, un-forced, genuine way. The Fame Monster showed that she still had more to offer, but the image/gimmick is now starting to take over and overshadow her talent. Then there's Born This Way....I won't even go there.<br /><br />I give it 1 star because I felt like this album could have been better than what it was praised at being. I think Lady Gaga, in general, can do better.artist and instead a wannabe, imitation of artists she admires.     I don't love this record as much as other people did.

0451191153|4.0|Fountainhead is a study of conflict certain to illicit varied responses from readers.  Mainly a vehicle to present the self-aggrandized philosopies of the author, it is also a skillfully crafted and highly engaging novel.    Characters who seem to be complex, fully rounded and realistic do not hold up well under close scrutiny.  To me, they became one-dimensional inhuman monsters--ALL of them.  Never before have I read a book in which my greatest desire was for all of the characters to be killed.  I have nothing but pity for those people who may choose to admire and emulate any character in this novel.  Despite this negative criticism of the characters themselves, there is much good to say about the central theme:  Stand up for your beliefs and do not apologize for your differences.    Rand offers evocative imagery with a minimum of words.  Rand's dialog is extremely good even if can be overly contrived and unrealistic at times.  Rand reserves a special contempt for her female characters and I cannot help but wonder if she was greatly disappointed with being born female.      Read, enjoy and discuss Fountainhead but be wary of taking it too much to heart thus risking your own humanity.
0679731725|5.0|As another reviewer stated, this book is deceptively simple and straight forward if you let it be. Without giving too much away, Stevens is a man who dedicates himself to his father's lifes work without questioning what his real passion is. Ishiguro is a master of wrapping up the human condition in a haunting little bow.
1594202710|5.0|I feel extremely fascinated and highly excited by reading this book. I must say that this book is the first and grandest work in telling the world the ideas and the historic processes and events that lead to the China policy established almost 40 years ago. For that, I believe, Dr. Henry Kissinger deserves gratitude and admiration from the people of both Countries. Dr. Kissinger, as one of the original architect and creator of the said policy, earned his place in history and the rightly honor to set the record straight. This book deserves the gratitude and admiration as well. It is my strong believe and conviction that Dr. Kissinger has been acted ingeniously and honorably, and has been having the highest and best interest of the United States in his mind and his heart every step on this historic journey. We should thank him for his life's work, as well as this book of his.    To make my review readable for most audiences (also simpler to write for myself), I will limit myself to point out who may find this book useful and interesting in the following. To save space and time, I will not repeat what is in this book, since there have been enough reviews and reports in the popular media that have explained the contents of the book (such as a considerable part of the book is authors understanding of Chinese history and its relation to this China policy).    Firstly, the students of history, political sciences, and foreign policies, and future diplomats may find this book a must in their educations and career. It goes without saying that anyone who wishes to have the details still have to search through the Government documents, and it is impossible to include such details in just one book. However, this book serves the purpose of pre-lecture for pre-practitioners, just like the one given to interns before their actually entering an ER and watching a surgery.    The future U.S. politicians, (by politicians I mean career politicians who really wish to make a difference inpractice, not those tongue-running wannabes who only care about running their tongues on something they do not even understand) might also find this book an eye-opener. They could start to learn, from the Master himself, how THINGS ARE DONE IN PRACTICE, no matter whether they agree with the policy or not.     For businessmen doing (or will be doing) business in China, they might get inspired to learn some Chinese history, and Wei qi (the game Go). If they have interest and the time, they might even find refreshing in having contacts with some ordinary Chinese people, as General Stilwell did almost a hundred years ago when he traveled through the mudded horse-pulled carts road. They are generally optimistic, friendly towards the foreigners, and easy going. It is also a fact that just few decades ago China still had problem feeding its own people, so you would see the changes first hand. As Dr. Kissinger explained, the Wei qi actually emphasizes on \\"shi\\" (I thought the best interpretation in English is \\"influence\\"), not immediate gains or losses. It simply says that you have to have your presence to have your influence and thereby your (possible) gains (hopefully not losses). Of course, the key is: what kind of presence and where to place it, and I think that is captalism-101. The original US China policy has had thick flavor of Wei qi in it. As we already knew now that the Gang of Four strongly opposed this act and did their worst to derail it, with the reason: Opposing the Western \\"Influence\\". So read it from the US side, the success of opening China has been a success in enormously expanding US influence in China as well in the globe. This is a fact, although as pragmatic diplomats / politicians they do not have to brag about it themselves, those retarded politicians (and /or wannabes) should not have forgotten it.    For those who cherish the memory of the history for this US China policy, you may find this book a treasure in your library without question.    Forother people who might be interested in this book, I can tell them that this is an honest work, and this is not some propaganda by some lowest class politicians (or wannabes) for the purpose of running for office, or make money or make themselves famous. Simply put it: READ THIS BOOK, AND YOU WILL NOT BE LIED TO.    Finally, I have to point out that Dr. Kissinger has addressed the issue of possible conflict between the two Countries in his book, and possible scenarios that could lead to such conflict. However, those are the questions that every President must face and must do his/her own job to resolve as they are elected by the people to do so.     I welcome any criticism and/or corrections on my possible omissions and/or mistakes of my views given above.
0307454541|4.0|I've read a lot of complaints that GWTDT is over the top violent and unrealistic. Sadly, what happens to Salander is all too real and her reaction while over the top, is believeable for someone with her history and social abilities.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the book. It's fluff in hard-crime clothing, throwing in random bits of sex more for fun than story or character development and giving us characters who would flabbergast most of us if we met even one of them in real life. BUT - I highly doubt Larsson ever intended for this to be read as \\"reality based in fiction\\"... most likely \\"fiction based in reality\\".
B0012GMVG2|5.0|I am not great at writing reviews, but I will try my best. This is one of Toto's best albums. The fusion rock sound is great with the talent of this band. Toto has always had this jazz fusion and rock sound. They harmonize very well together. There are a lot of hits from this CD including \\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\". \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" is also a song will you will recognize. Overall this is a really good CD. If you are a music fan of any kind you should own this CD.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Burlesque may not be the newest story with its somewhat predictable plot; but the film is rather enjoyable nonetheless. Its strength comes from the multiple musical numbers and the acting of the main characters since the somewhat campy plot is not the deepest and the action takes its time to play out. Cher, Stanley Tucci, Christina Aguilera and Cam Gigandet of Twilight fame provide wonderful performances. In addition, the choreography and cinematography are excellent; and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.<br /><br />When the film starts, we quickly meet Ali (short for \\"Alice,\\" played by Christina Aguilera) who works in a local bar in a small town in Iowa. Although she's rather young, Ali believes in herself, knows she has talent--and she's convinced she's going nowhere fast. She travels by bus to Los Angeles and after some pushing finds work in a burlesque nightclub that has seen better days owned primarily by Tess (Cher) with Tess' ex Vince (Peter Gallagher) having a partial financial interest in the club. Ali also makes friends with a bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet) and this proves helpful when her apartment is broken into--Ali's savings has been stolen and Jack (who has a fianc&eacute;e) lets Ali stay at his place until Ali can get another home and become more settled.<br /><br />Of course, things get more complicated. Ali and Jack start noticing each other while Jack's fianc&eacute;e Natalie (Dianna Agron) is in New York doing a play. Ali eventually makes her way onto the stage in Tess' club as a dancer just like she dreamed of doing--but a real surprise comes when jealous dancer Nikki (Kristen Bell) pulls the plug on the lip-synching music and Ali must face the crowd and sing.<br /><br />In addition, Eric Dane does a good job of playing Marcus, a rich guy who buys his way into getting everything he ever wants--including Tess' club so he can use it according to his own plans. Tess must find a way to keep her club which is running dangerously low on funds to make payments and stay open; and things look pretty bleak; it would break Tess' heart to lose or even sell her club.<br /><br />You might think I already gave away too much; but I assure you that I haven't. Moreover, I won't say much more for fear of adding spoilers; suffice it to say that you will be struck by the musical numbers in this film. Christina Aguilera in her very first film already seems destined to become a film star seemingly effortlessly!<br /><br />The DVD comes with alternate footage that I liked and there is a short of \\"bloopers.\\"<br /><br />Overall, Burlesque probably won't win Best Picture at Oscar time but it's entertaining nonetheless. Fans of the actors in the film will want this for their collections; and people who enjoy musicals with a side dish of camp will want this, too.stay open; and things look pretty bleak; it would break Tess' heart to lose or even sell her club.

B000VFGQUC|5.0|I didnt know much about TLizzy so holding a stack of Dvds, my friend said to get this one- great call. It got me into this band bigtime, so when i bought the other dvds, they didnt compare. This Dvd is so great! So if you're considering this DvD I highly recommend it- The band is really tight and wonderful on both live shows, and the interview section is great- Scott Gorham is always a pleasure to hear articulate. The lipsynched appearances  on ToTP are a treat, esp. Whiskey, Dontbelieve, Dancin/Moonlight. Everytime I play it, I have to hit the audio button. From there I find the sound quality perfectly fine, and I would recommend this disc to anybody into music Dvds, not just fans. This is very stellar repesentation of this band, who I now adore. Id compare this to Live Vengeance for quality video of band at its energetic best from a bygone era. However, this is two sets,one with ten songs,1977 from the classic lineup that did the classic live album, and  one with 8 songs (if you dont know the songs from the 1983 set, i argue theyre stronger) from farewell tour- Phil says its Sykes first night live - if so this is a great set nonetheless. i ended up hooked on these guys,watching this everyday,buying some TL cds and other dvds- but this one was the best by far. I collect piles of rock dvds: this catapulted to an alltime fave w a bullet.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Great Sound Quality on this product. Be advised that it can impact your wifi performance due to interference. If you place product away from router or wireless xbox you will be fine.
B000TEPJOY|5.0|It was not too often that Miles Davis took second billing to anyone, but such is the respect and friendship he must have had for Julian `Cannonball' Addeley that he chose to lend his magic to this quintet in a more low key manner. There are certainly Miles influences evident on the tracks in which he is featured, giving this album a highly accessible quality. The highlight for me is `Autumn Leaves', with its haunting introduction leading to the more preferred down tempo approach to this classic track. All up, it's a very smooth album that can be justifiably labelled as one of the great jazz recordings. Certainly, albums such as this laid the foundation for `Kind of Blue' ...say no more!
B000JML7EC|5.0|A great adventure read.  I do wish I had read it when I was 12, but I think there were elements of the book that I would not have picked up on at that age that I enjoyed now.  I'll suggest it to my boys when they are old enough to enjoy it!
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|This Maiden other than the 1980-1990 compilation are the only Maiden Cd's that you need.  Over 2 hours of great Maiden and great live tracks...Great cover art...Great sound quality...perfect!!!
0723257639|4.0|A beautifully boxed & presented collection of books. The books are a little smaller than I thought, I bought this as a keep sake for my daughters first birthday.
0670022411|1.0|I bought this book because I was intrigued by the summary...witches, vampires, history. It sounded like a cross between Harry Potter, The Historian and Twilight. Boy, were my expectations high. The characters are semi-developed, the plot veers left and right and much of it feels forced and contrived. I had a hard time getting through the sappy romance of the Twilight books, but this was even worse. The love story of A Discovery of Witches makes up the bulk of the book; even so , it was so boring and sappy it had me constantly rolling my eyes. But, since I paid for it, I had to finish it. There is no climax to speak of, and the books ends right at the brink of a huge war between all the supernatural beings. I stuck with this book, struggling through the tedium to see how the war turns out, and it isn't even in the book! What a waste of time and money.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great movie and great series.  As others have suggested there should be another season and movie.  It is just not enough there is more story to be told.  The one thing I did not like is the horrible terrible opening of the series.  cowboy music???? it is so irrelevant to the series. those guys should be penalized somehow.
B001FB55YE|4.0|This movie is along the lines of Lock, Stock, and 3 Smoking Barrels. As far as flavor there is a little of Tarantino's hip-cool character and Coen Brothers' twist. A great all-time classic? No. But it is an excellent and entertaining movie.
0446691437|5.0|I read this book on recommendation of Bud Stone of The Graduate Institute ([...] As a remarkably intelligent and insightful man, I knew his recommendation would be valuable. However, I had no idea exactly how much it would impact me. The book is truly amazing - I laughed, I cried. I felt free from all the \\"resistance\\" that was keeping me from finishing my writing projects. Suddenly everything made sense. I'm not crazy; I'm human. Thank you Pressfield. Thank You!<br /><br />On another note - I don't read quickly, but this piece is an engaging and very fast read. It is well worth the money and more.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I typically don't pick favorites, but if forced, I would pick The Fall as my all-time favorite movie. It is one of the greatest unsung crimes that Cantica Untaru did not win the academy award for best actress: I don't care that she is just a kid - she commands the screen and will steal your heart. I would attempt to explain the greatness of The Fall, but it is best to just immerse yourself in it. Analogous to Lay's potato chips; I bet you can't just watch it once!
0142004413|5.0|As our family anticipated a trip to Greece, we came across this book, \\"My Family and Other Animals,\\" which is set on the western Greek island of Corfu. Gerald and his eccentric family move to the island from England, where all manner of strange and hilarious events are staged. A minor cult following of the book has developed, where people travel to Corfu to walk in the footsteps of young Gerald as he sought out all the local fauna, picnicked with his family, and learned Greek and local lore from his neighbors.    There have been several movies made of this book, but the most recent with Imelda Stanton as the mother is just wonderfully done. Do yourself the favor of savoring this book first. Fortunately, the book has recently been republished; when I went on the hunt I had to buy an old copy on eBay from Australia! Enjoy.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|From the awesome preview & Led Zepplin intro I was really excited to see this movie... until I actually saw it.  'Sucker Punch' is a perfect example of a good concept that was ALL show and an ambiguous lack luster storyline.  It tried the \\"dream within a dream\\" motif that worked so well for 'Inception' and instead of drawing audiences into it's fantasy world, it fell FLAT.  The storyline was mediocre at best and tried to wow audiences with it's photoshop filters, special effects, & soundtrack.  I felt like I was trapped inside a psychedelic video game the entire movie and was wondering what drugs Zack was on when he wrote this movie.  And the Yoda like message at the end was laughable at best after viewing that mess.  The message I took was, \\"There is freedom in your own delusions.\\"  Which is exactly what many who are fans of this genre do to escape the reality of their own lives.  This was by far the most disappointing movie I've seen in the last 2 years and I felt 'Sucker Punched' atter paying to see it.  I actually felt sorry for the actresses who did a great job with their performances.  I'm frightened to think what Zack Snyder is going to do with the Superman franchise after seeing this train wreck. And does anyone actually think an extended cut of this film is going to be any better?  Fool me once, shame on you...
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|If you're into CGI (Computer Generated Image) films or if you've been fortunate to play this game on PlayStation I (PSX)or the PC version, then this sequel is truly meant for you. I wish they could lenghten even more the battle between Sephiroth and Cloud at the end, but I guess that people unfamiliar with the game would not find this as quite as entertaining for as much as those folks who spent over 100 hours of gameplay to finish each game, with as much of the side quests as well (Chocobo race anyone?) or the other gold theme park (I forgot its name...)

B000SE0OYA|5.0|As advertised and prompt shipping. I bought this before I realized that if you are careful and don't breathe the waste toner dust, you can clean the original Toner Box. I did that before the new unit arrived and was printing that same night. The printer stops working when the box is full so you may have to attempt the cleaning if you can't wait for the new unit to arrive. I kept the new one and will use it some day. There is a lot of good information about workarounds for these type of printers on the net. Google your particular model. You'll be surprised!
B004V2S4SS|2.0|I got into watching Medium in Season 3 , loved it from then onwards thought season 4 was a little procedural and unimaginative , seasons 5&6 are truly excellent actually the best of the lot IMO.    As you might know in Ep.22 of season 6 Allison visions her own death and her funeral in action - this personally should have been the last scene for the show and would have made more logical sense , instead we get 13 more episodes which frankly were unneeded and tarnish a great show.    Given that i watched seasons 1&2 after season 4 i feel i have all the experience needed to write a general analysis on the show and it's seven season life.    What i will say is that Medium had very good luck. It was axed , re-commisioned by CBS and 35 more episodes were made as a result.    There is not a show currently on CBS/Fox/ABC/NBC that is similar and 7 seasons is about the best that any tv series can do before cast start getting itchy - and either leave or get a pay bump.    Perhaps in the future we'll hear more about the show and it's Final Season - i'm sure that the writers simply could not create a decent final run and went for a poor 11 episodes , CBS were annoyed and gave them 126 minutes to wrap things up instead of over another 9 episodes.
B000S9HVZU|3.0|Now, there's nothing \\"wrong\\" with the book. Amazon's definition for 3-stars perfectly describes my opinion of the book-- it's okay. But, somehow, the movie's better... which shocks me given that I'd always been told with so many movies \\"read the book, it's better.\\" Not the case here.    I can't recall any major difference between the book and the movie. Essentially the same. Three parallel stories: Virginia Woolf writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway [a book I highly recommend, although it can be difficult], Laura Brown reading Mrs. Dalloway, and Clarissa who's \\"being\\" a modern day Mrs. Dalloway giving a party. And as makes perfect sense, Cunningham gives each their own chapters and goes back and forth among the three.    But that movement among the three ladies works so much better visually on screen than it does verbally on paper.     Again, nothing wrong with the book. I thought it was okay. But the film is overwhelmingly fantastic. Maybe not a fair comparison, but there it is.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|I was a big fan of the Firefly series. I was very excited about the release of Serenity and for good reason. The start of the movie sort of recaps what we learn in the television series, which is understandable, as many of the movie fans may not have seen the series first. It is a shame that some of the main characters from the series don't have very big parts in the movie, but that isn't a negative. Serenity is a fun, action packed, science fiction adventure. The crew travel from planet to planet, as they are hunted by the govenment. Some of the lines still make me laugh after watching them about twenty times. I think the ending of this movie is one of my favourite I have ever seen. This is a must see for any science fiction fan!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This is the best Harry Potter movie yet, and with such exceptional writing, acting, and special effects, it should be on Blu-Ray.  I'm of the mind that if a film doesn't meet this criteria, then it can just remain on DVD (for example, I only plan on purchasing the Blu-Ray versions of the Harry Potter movies from the third one on).  I was also lucky to get this for an amazing price shortly after it was released, which is great reason why people should buy what they want early on if at all possible.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|I was a massive fan of the original movie. I was excited when I found out they were doing a sequel and my excitement grew when I found out, Jeff Bridges, was going to be back. The movie really doesn't disappoint. The fast paced story kicks off with Flynn's son breaking into the company building and causing problems. Flynn has been missing for years, but when his son finds the machine he is teleported onto the Grid. The story is then a visual masterpiece. I think the characters were amazing and well casted. The action is very face paced, but in keeping with the actual story and not there for the sake of being there. I really enjoyed this movie. My only negative is that I would have liked to see more of, Tron. Tron was my favourite character from the original and he really was a side show piece in this movie. I could watch this movie again and again!

0525422943|5.0|Gayle Forman's IF I STAY was a sensation when it was published in 2009. Striking a chord with readers and reviewers alike, it was the kind of powerful, gut-wrenching novel that deeply affected everyone who was fortunate enough to open its pages. Simultaneously a painful meditation on grief and loss and an optimistic love letter to life itself, IF I STAY was told from the point of view of Mia, a young woman who has barely survived the devastating car accident that claimed the lives of her parents and brother. Although her body was locked in a coma, Mia's mind and spirit were very much awake, as she simultaneously mourned and remembered her family and absorbed the pleas of her loved ones who begged her to stay alive.    One of those friends was Adam, Mia's boyfriend who, in WHERE SHE WENT, gets a chance to narrate his own story, to tell the reader what happened after Mia decided to listen to his exhortations and stay alive. In part, at least, for him. In the three years since Mia's accident, things have changed for all of them, not least for Adam himself, who became an overnight sensation, the lead singer and songwriter of a phenomenally successful band, boyfriend of a beautiful actress, recognized on the street by countless passersby.    Ironically, what fueled all those angry, despondent lyrics that made Adam's band, Shooting Star, an overnight sensation was Mia herself, the fact that shortly after she emerged from rehab after her accident, she left Portland, Oregon, for a new life at Juilliard in New York City. She never looked back, or visited home; she simply left Adam to deal with his demons himself. Now, in the course of one night, Adam has the opportunity to find her again. But does she even want to be found?    \\"I think of all the voices that clatter around in my head,\\" Adam thinks to himself, \\"voices that I'm pretty sure are just some older, or younger, or just better versions of me. There have been times --- when things have been really bleak --- that I'vetried to summon her, to have her answer me back, but it never works. I just get me. If I want her voice, I have to rely on memories. At least I have plenty of those.\\" Memories --- of the time before Mia's accident as well as the days and weeks directly after --- form much of Adam's narrative, looking backward even as he tries to reconnect with a future he almost, but not quite, had let go of.    If IF I STAY was a gut punch of a book, WHERE SHE WENT is more of a slow burn, the kind of ache you get after a hundred sit-ups or a 10-mile run. Adam and Mia are both older and wiser, jaded in their way, but unable or unwilling to leave behind who they were before. Again, Forman tells a powerful tale of grief, guilt and starting over, even as she crafts a compelling, deeply romantic love story that will keep readers guessing --- and cringing, sighing and hoping --- until the very last page.        --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

B00402FGE4|1.0|When I watched the pilot of this show with great enjoyment.  I loved the idea (even if it did kind of remind me of voyager.  But this was Stargate and the gate was hardly used.  Why not find any other species on the planets?  How about ruins?  No other species except hostile ones?  How about dead civilizations?  This could have been so much more than it was.  Could have gone after the over 30 crowd that stay home most nights.  It might have made a difference in ratings.  The youngsters on this show, except for SGT. Greer are completely forgettable.  Also, I found it offensive that Young would leave Dr. Rush on the planet.  In the first two Stargates we learned to honor annd respect our military.  I was apalled that they would portray our military this way (especially since I am a veteran).
B000025XKM|5.0|This album is old but it has aged very well. Nick Drake's soothing guitar and simple lyrics make life in a hectic world seem a little bit more clear.<br /><br />This album is only about a half hour long but the sparsity of it is what makes it beautiful. You can see Nick Drake sitting with his guitar as he records the album. Pink Moon has a very human feel to it which a lot of music (even the classics) lack. I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes softer folk music and has a soft spot for acoustic guitar.<br /><br />The lyrics are simple and the guitar is sometimes complex and sadly this was Drake's final album before he died. This type of music isn't for everyone but if you are into it, this album is a great buy for your collection.

0307341577|3.0|I'm a big fan of Gillian Flynn's writing; it's creative, dramatic, evocative, realistic, and grittier than almost any mystery/crime writer I can think of.  The problem I have with her books is related to plot; in both of her first two books, she spun a dark, tangled who-dunnit story that just didn't pan out for me in the end.  In Dark Places, the story revolves around a girl whose family was murdered years ago.  Her brother was arrested and charged with the murders, but years later the girl begins an investigation that reveals a good 6 or 8 other people who might have committed the crimes.  The main plot is fairly gripping---although it does tend to slow down and get a little drab in the middle---but when we come to the big \\"who-dunnit\\" moment, I felt completely let down.  I'll avoid any spoilers, but suffice it to say that part of the solution was very predictable, and the other part was so off the wall and totally unbelievable that it left me terribly disappointed.  This was one case where the idea for the book was far better than the book itself.
0385495323|5.0|bought this a long time ago.  Figured I would add my 2 cents.    This book is awesome. Historically and mathematically.    You cannot understand why the allies won world war one and two without it.    The polish guy you never heard of and the gay english guy...these two are owed more than any other for defeating the germans in world war II.    One guy lives in obscurity, one was destroyed by his own people...very sad.    Great history, great depth, must read
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I just watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. Jake and Anne are so talented they make you care about the characters they play. The storyline really makes you hate lawyers and the drug companies (they are the problem along with the current administration); but I digress. Jamie (Jake) is a self-centered hedonist who's only goal is to put another notch on his belt or even better...put a notch on the belt while making money. Maggie (Anne) is a former artist who can't bear to get close to any one because she's scared to death she'll be left alone so she believes if she just shuts off her feelings she never get hurt. Jamie falls hard for Maggie and Maggie finally opens her heart. We know that the \\"true\\" ending will not be happy but we, as an audience, are willing to watch the present fairytale and be happy for them in the moment. One line that really hit me hard was \\"I need you more than you need me.\\"...How many times have you felt like that? I have!
B001DSNEJM|3.0|Paul Walker did a good job in this movie, but the movie itself was lacking a little something more.  The build up to the resolution was good, but it just seemed that once you find out what was going on, it ended.  The resolution could've had a little more meat to its bones.  There was so much potential there.  Better writers would've made this movie great!      SPOILER ALERT:  The one aspect that I just can't come to terms with, is Ben's ability to \\"hack\\" into the computer without using a password.  I'm sorry, but that was just NOT believable.  There's no way that he had to break into a building or a room, then have full access to the computer WITHOUT password protection.  Yeah, that's completely BS, especially with the information that was on that computer.  They could've ended the movie better as well.  There's NO WAY that those guys would let Ben just \\"walk\\" without some sort of exciting pursuit, changing of identity, moving or running...something.  Maybe they are setting up for a sequel?  You never know these days...

B003F3NDWG|5.0|When a beloved show ends for the season, what's a devoted fan to do but go back to the archives. Therefore, I staged a season one marathon, a season I owned and had reviewed on Amazon a few years ago in my review entitled:  \\"More Than Just Another Pretty Face.\\" Who can forget the meeting of the intelligent, kind, handsome, fun-loving, intrepid writer and the valiant, complex, stunningly beautiful detective? One scene still had me laughing after two years.  In this scene Rick and Alexis, while playing a father daughter game of laser tag, invite into their home a stunned Kate Beckett. And then Rick's mother makes a grand dame entrance in her green -clay facial.  Humor, brilliant repartee, sight gags, fantastic ensemble acting, excellent writing and production values, humans in all of their diversity, evoke laughter, emotional tension and tears.   I tried to talk to my family about my \\"issues,\\" to no avail.  I required more Castle weekly appointments.  I wrote a review entitled \\"I'll Stand By You,\\" about the season three finale and corresponded with a compatriot.  How amazing the power of the internet and of Amazon to connect total strangers in an exchange of ideas and a meeting of the minds.  Still I was in withdrawal.      I had to get my hands on Season Two;   I ordered and waited.     I watched again a few of the remaining season three entries on demand, and while critically examining the few entries available, I drew more conclusions about the show.  Today I wrote an additional review on\\" Knockout\\" and later greeted my UPS lady. My very own season two had arrived.  Yes, another marathon or two is in store for me and probably another review, but first I wanted to share some additional conclusions I have made regarding the season three finale.      In \\"Knockout,\\" Castle's third season finale, Kate says to Rick, \\"You don't know me, Rick, you think you do but you don't.\\" And he responds that he knows she hides in her mother's murder case and she stays with men she doesn't love. He claims she could be happy, but she is afraid to be happy.  This is true, but Rick, the same applies to you.  You stay safe with frivolous women who mean nothing or two ex wives.  Indeed, Rick Castle is a loving son and a magnificent father. A good friend and an intrepid partner, he is uplifting and fun.  But he has a painful awareness, masked with good humor, that his mother doesn't even know who fathered him.  Love his mother he does, but this knowledge has to hurt. He, too, is afraid of a deeper rejection or disappointment in love.    We know this fear of complete happiness and love runs through the valiant Kate. With a grieving but recovering alcoholic father and her mother murdered, her fears are manifest and masked with safe lovers who will not press her for the love she cannot give.  She knows Rick is different, but he cannot or won't force her to acknowledge their mutual and powerful attraction.  Everyone around them sees their love.  Therein remains the frustration of the viewer and the genius of the writers of this tremendously human romance, drama, comedy and police procedural.      Vowed to have Kate's back, \\"always,\\" Rick accompanies Kate to LA to track and capture the man who has killed Kate's mentor and friend.  While staying together in a suite, Rick confesses to Kate, \\"You know what I thought when I first met you. You were a mystery I would never solve... I am amazed at the depths of your strength and your heart.\\"  And realizing that the moment is emotionally charged, he backs off with these words:  \\"and your hotness.\\"  Kate responds, \\"You aren't so bad yourself.\\"     The next scene is a metaphor for the show.  Exposed by an obvious mutual desire, Kate panics and retires to her room. To distance herself Kate calls him Castle as he, stricken, remains and endearingly calls her Kate. Behind Kate's locked door the director focuses on the door handle and Kate's unsteady hand.  Will the conflicted and sometimes shy Kate erase the barrier andgo to Rick?   With his heart racing or perhaps sinking, Rick waits for the woman he loves to make a choice, to come to him.  Seconds pound or does time stand still.  When Kate finally opens the door to go to Rick, it is too late.  Humbled or heart -broken, Rick has retreated to his room. And Kate watches his door shut.    From the soundtrack, a fragment of a song permeates the air as this dance of love and desire unfolds. From Pearl Jam's Just Breathe, these words come through:  \\"Oh, I am a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love.......stay with me.\\"      In the same scene Josh Ritter's plaintive song and words resound, reflecting Rick's unspoken words:              And I keep me in a vacant lot            In the ivy and forget-me-nots            Hoping you will come and untangle me one of these days            Come and find me now.
B005342N58|5.0|So many people complain about how they lack the energy of their first album, but I'd like to go out on a limb and say at least the last two albums (Humbug and Suck it and See) are actually stronger overall albums than their debut, and this might be a little more consistent than Humbug. It's melodic, concise, and while it's a throwback to '60s pop, it's more progressive than their first two albums. I'd say the two weakest songs on here are the two singles, Brick by Brick, which really isn't much of a song in itself, and Don't Sit Down..., which is fun and clever but isn't as deep or intricate as most of the other songs. I was really disappointed when I first heard these, but in the context of the album, they seem to fit, lightening the mood and quickening the pace just enough to balance out the slower second half, with the great but mellow songs Love is a Lazerquest and Suck it and See. So while many people are disappointed, I find this very satisfying, and it actually seems to improve on little aspects of the other albums. It's more restrained than Whatever People Say I Am... (in a good way- there isn't an overabundance of Dancing Shoes and Still Take You Home-type songs), more complete than Favourite Worst Nightmare (which had some filler), and more consistent than Humbug (which, while I love it even still, has the clunky spelling of Dangerous Animals and the musically out of place- while still brilliant- Cornerstone). So for those who aren't looking for fast, energetic teenage jam sessions but want something more in the vein of Last Shadow Puppets (though a little lighter than that), this is for you.
B00406UK5A|3.0|Like \\"The Eagle\\" which came out in 2011, \\"Centurion\\" is based (loosely) on a real event-the loss of the 9th Legion in Northern Scotland. \\"Centurion\\" takes a more military-centric view of the event, focusing on the men who lost their unit and their struggle to return to Roman lines while pursued by a Pict warband. Essentially a standard chase film, you'll see most of its twists and turns coming, but the realism of the world the movie creates does take you back to Roman times. The action and combat are riveting, and it's an entertaining movie.
0553593544|3.0|I gave this novel three stars because I felt that Robert Ludlum used Flashbacks too much and as a kind of filler and I hate too much filler. I think that the author did OK with the flashbacks which I know are much more diffficult to do in a book than in a movie. Again I just feel he used them too much and caused it to drag a good story line down. I do enjoy this type of special ops story and I will read the rest of the \\"Bourne\\" series, but it will have to go some to reach the level of Vince Flynn's \\"Mitch Rapp\\" Series.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Chuck is a great show. It is a nice breath of fresh air from other comedies and reality shows. Chuck is one of the most creative concepts on television. I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say much. All I will say is that it is very well written and does not include many cliches. The show is unpredictable and includes many twists and turns. The acting on Chuck is very good. Each actor plays their character perfectly and I wouldn't make any adjustments to the cast. All the actors seem extremely comfortable in their roles. Whoever did the casting is very talented. Chuck is a good mix of action and comedy. The action sequences are intense and the hand to hand combat is wonderful. It is very addicting and fun to watch. Their is a dash of romance but is in no way over the top. If you have not watched the first three seasons then I highly suggest you watch those before this. You can still catch on to the story and enjoy Chuck if you start this season, but you will miss a lot of backstories that make the characters even more likable. In Season 4, we learn a lot more about Chuck and Sarah's relationship. New characters are also introduced. Season 4 is a great addition to the Chuck series. I would like to see much more of Casey and Morgan in the next season. We saw a lot of them in the first three seasons and even in this seasson but I still think they have much more to offer. I think we will see more of Morgan based on the Cliffhanger but I won't ruin anything. One of the best things about this season is that we get to dive even deeper into the characters and learn even more about their pasts. Overall, Chuck is one of the best shows on television. Everything is outstanding and I cannot believe this show doesn't have more fans. I can't wait for season 5. Do yourself a favor and try out Chuck.
0307272702|5.0|Reviewed by Carol Petersen, RPh, CNP - Women's International Pharmacy<br /><br />Recently, I was stopped in my tracks when I read a statement I found on the internet \\"Crash Test Dummies Don't Reflect Growing Obesity\\" and found the thought mildly alarming.  Gary Taubes may have pondered a similar thought when he set out to write Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It.<br /><br />Gary Taubes is a science writer who embarked on a project to collect what real science can tell us about the growing problem of obesity.  Part of the problem, he says, is that we have embraced a very simple dogma for decades.  The dogma is that obesity is a matter of too much stored energy (calories).  The dogma states that if you simply control the calories you take in or you increase your energy expenditure by exercise, you will lose the stored fat.  The fundamental argument against that simplistic thinking is that it isn't working.  We are faced with a growing epidemic of obesity worldwide.<br /><br />Taubes' review of the literature shows ample documentation that when you increase your energy expenditures with increased exercise, you will also typically increase your appetite and food intake.  He cites numerous animal and human studies demonstrating that increased exercise actually increased body fat.<br /><br />Jean Mayer, PhD, a renowned scientist, physiologist and nutritionist, was a huge proponent of the theory that a sedentary lifestyle was the cause of obesity.  Taubes explains that Mayer's thinking was based on the fact that \\"his job never required that he reduce a fat person to a healthy weight, so his ideas were less fettered by real-life experience,\\" yet Mayer had a strong influence on the popular press.<br /><br />Taubes also cites an interesting experiment done in the early 1970s that involved removing the ovaries from female rats.  After the surgery, the rats ate voraciously and became obese.  According to the calories in/calories out theory, the rats would become obese because they ate more.  However, when another group of female rats had their ovaries removed and also had their food intake restricted, they became fat just as quickly and also became very sedentary.  Now, you could argue that the low energy expenditure led to obesity.  However, when estrogen was given back to the rats, they were able to return to normal size, along with normal food intake and normal activity.  Taubes explains that what we learned from this experiment is that the removal of the ovaries causes a disruption of the fat tissue, leading to a drive to get fatter either by overeating or restricting energy output.  Estrogen, as it turns out, inhibits the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which tends to pull fat into fat cells or muscle cells.<br /><br />As Taubes suggests, the physiology of fat cells is complex and involves many hormones and enzymes.  Insulin is the hormone that trumps them all: the higher the level of insulin, the greater the tendency to store fat.  The trigger for increasing insulin is the type of food we eat.  Carbohydrates such as fructose, sugar, soda, cereal, bread, potato, alcohol and pasta all trigger greater insulin levels.  High-fructose corn syrup, which was introduced in the late 1970s, includes about 42% glucose.  This combination is now thought to be one of the most fat-creating substances around.<br /><br />The answer to the obesity problem, according to Gary Taubes, is to return to a more Paleolithic diet with an emphasis on protein (particularly animal protein) and fats.  Carbohydrates should be restricted to low-glycemic vegetables such as green leafy vegetables.  Depending upon the carbohydrate sensitivity of the individual, the amount of carbohydrates may need to be very restricted in some cases.  The food pyramid, which puts meat and fats at the top to be used sparingly while breads and pastas are at the bottom to be used liberally, should be inverted.<br /><br />This book is a welcome read, but it is not a book full of recipes and menu guides.  It contains and/or references useful scientific information from reputable sources.  For example, according to the Lifestyle Medicine Clinic at Duke University, those interested in weight loss should limit their daily intake of carbohydrates to 20 grams per day.  This, along with other guidelines, can be found in the Appendix.<br /><br />Gary Taubes summarizes why this book should be of interest to those grappling with obesity: we \\"westernized\\" our diets with too many carbohydrates, and while doing so we also \\"westernized\\" our health with the introduction of cancers, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and more.  It is time to step back and sort through the food and diet industry propaganda to find out what really works.references useful scientific information from reputable sources.

B0052GVGYG|5.0|This album will send chills through you on the hot summer days to come. Great slide blues, sexy throaty vocals and a horn section that brings big city blues to your home and yard. This album has a lot of honesty in its sound; I would be surprise if these were not one take recordings, they sure sound like they are. A lot of blues albums get over produced and lose some of their soul in the process but Tedeschi and Trucks' love of the music and love for one another shimmers in every song without tricks. Great job.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read this book a while ago after looking for a good mystery to fill up some spare time.  This book, though I put it down a while ago, still haunts me. If you're looking for a scary (and yes, it's really scary) page turner that will keep you guessing until the very end, read this.
031261246X|3.0|I am a lover of hacker/techie novels, and this was a fun read.  Every chapter had computer talk and to read a fictional story that also educates in malware/viruses was very fun.  However, you could definitely tell that this was an author's first attempt at writing a novel.  This book was barely over 300 pages, the characters were not developed well at all, and the suspense was lacking.  This all, of course, is my opinion.  Overall, I would recommend it to a computer nerd, but thats about it.
0312567448|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She loved it!  All of her friends, male and female have asked to borrow the book.
0670022411|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book.  Love the genre.  Read the hype!  It was VERY disappointing.  Her main character did a lot of sleeping, eating and walking around.  No character development.  Nothing that grabbed one's attention or kept it.  I skimmed the final chapter or two, but don't think I missed anything.
B004X904JQ|4.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews this album is getting.  I fully understand how some die hard fans would be a little disappointed, but to say that this album is worse than Metallica's St. Anger...c'mon.  First off, Morbid Angel has experimented since \\"Blessed Are The Sick,\\" so more experimentation should be no surprise.  This album is more \\"classic\\" Morbid Angel than anything they put out without David Vincent.  In my opinion, Morbid Angel headed to far into Death Metal redundancy with \\"Formulas...\\" to \\"Heretic.\\"  If this album remained straight forward Death Metal from beginning to end, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.  I like \\"Too Extreme,\\" \\"Destructos Vs. The Earth,\\" and even \\"Radikult.\\"  I like how these three tracks are placed throughout the album and break up the full on Death Metal assault and gives the album some variation.  I know I am in the minority here, when I say that this is the best Morbid Angel album since \\"Domination.\\"
B0050N8N0Q|4.0|Album is great but short. Interesting music that is hard to get out of your head. Of course there is a great deal of electronic influence on this album. I would love to see some collaboration with the chemical brothers. Really can't wait to hear more from them. Absolutely worth $10.      With the help of a good pair of headphones, Miss You is one of the coolest sounding songs I have heard in awhile.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an excellent product for the money.  I have seen some criticisms about it not being very substantial, and the like, which may be valid.  However, you are looking at more than twice this cost to get a comparable LowePro bag, so you need to be somewhat realistic.  The bag is well constructed, and easily configurable.  The padding and construction are not so robust that I would just drop it on the floor with my camera equipment in it, but I doubt any bag would pass that test.  The bag is a bit smaller than I had expected, which isn't a problem, but you should actually sketch out the dimensions if you imagine this may be an issue for you.<br /><br />The zippers open very easily and smoothly, which is a nice touch.  I have to agree with an earlier criticism I read that the (many) zipper pulls all have \\"Amazon basics\\" emblazoned on them in bright lettering - I could really do without that, and it's not going to be easily removed.<br /><br />As a good friend once said to me, \\"It is what it is.\\"  This is a _basic_ camera backpack, at a very attractive price point.  Given that, it's definitely a 5-star'er.
0385493622|5.0|This is a fine book and well-worth the read for those interested in the history of mathematics and the recent effort (and successful effort) of one person to solve the Fermat Last Problem. Nicely written.

B002VECMAE|2.0|\\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" tells the story of a branch of the US Army trying to determine whether New Age lingo and techniques had military applications. Jeff Bridges, once a hard-edged grunt in Vietnam, transforms into a half-crazed army hippy who grows his hair and beard, smokes dope and starts breaking the rules. He is tolerated because he gets results. Soon, he has a squadron of others (including George Clooney and Kevin Spacey) to train in his new methods.<br /><br />The filmmakers didn't know what to do with their material. It isn't straight history. It strains toward satire, but doesn't pull it off. The problem is that a satire needs to show the characters grappling with a non-existent or misunderstood problem. In \\"Goats,\\" however, the film suggests that there is method to the madness. The film gets stuck because it simultaneously has to ridicule people for searching for psychics weapons, while suggesting that they could exist. If mind weapons could be real, where is the comedy of watching people try to find them? No amount of mugging by Clooney and Bridges can pull this one out.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Men who Stare at Goats,\\" a movie with enormous promise, rates a loud \\"Baa.\\"
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|All the actors in this were likeable and entertaining, enjoyable to be around. The story is pedestrian, and suffers from the idea that it is clever, creative, and a load of fun. After too many facile escapes the story loses it's credibility. Morgan Freeman, OK, she shoots him causing a distraction. But then show the hoard of FBI agents pursuing the good guy escapees. Then a close-up of the now forgotten Morgan Freeman's face. An eye pops open, rolling back and forth, and seeing nobody around. He gets up. knocks on his bullet-proof vest (gotten from Richard Dreyfuss's hidden room armory)...and  walks away. His death didn't belong in this lighthearted story, and he could have been greatly employed in later scenes. The idea of retired agents kicking butt, intriguing, but needs a more worthy story.
B0001611DI|5.0|I went to see this movie when I was about 9 yrs old. and it really scared the hell out of me!! after I saw it, I began having nightmares for most of my teenage and adult life, I woulld wake up in the middle of the night and go to the window to see if there were any zombies lurching. around talk about tramatized!!! recommened for all over 14 with strong stomaches. one of the best zombie movies of all time!!!

0470449748|3.0|So I purchased this yesterday and started on the diagnostic questions.    Already found a mistake in the book. Question 5 on page 20 is supposed to reference \\"4 feet of water\\" instead my copy says \\"2 feet of water\\". The explanation and the answer are only correct assuming the height of the water is 4 feet. But the question in my copy says 2 feet!    This really upset me as I expected this to be vetted out in all the publications of this book.     I will upload a video showing evidence of this.
0316056863|3.0|I honestly didn't like this book that much, but I think it's because I was expecting too much from it since I absolutely love Tina Fey.<br /><br />I'm not great at remembering actors/comedians names, so that was probably a downfall too.  She would reference people and I wouldn't remember who they were, so I had to ask my husband or Google who they were so the story would make sense to me.  Also, some of the references were a little before my time since I'm 22 and she's 40.<br /><br />There were definitely parts that made me laugh out loud because it is Tina Fey and she is funny.  But I just didn't find it as great as others have.<br /><br />I rated this book a 3.  I enjoyed it, for the most part, but I won't read it again.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|Spent a lot of time researching watches in this price range.  Extremely happy with my choice of the skx007.  Feels like a serious value.  Size is just right.  Worth noting is the depth of the bezel.  It creates a distinct divers watch feel that is hard to see in pictures.  The Jubilee band is comfortable and flexible, the contrast of the hollow polished links against the brushed satin solid links provides a distinct look.  I have now ordered a Zulu ballistic nylon band for a different - casual look.  Watch came with original Seiko manual, tags, case back protective film, Seiko box - basically everything you would expect from a dealer.  Arrived across country several days early.  Very pleased with purchase.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|Like said, most kids in America would love this. I'm a teenager, and I LOVED the movie. It was funny, and it kept my attention. There was no scene that I didn't smile at! Kids/Teens age 4-17 will love it.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|Like others,I read reviews and forums about this album before it came out and listened to samples but tried not to make any judgements before I listened to the whole thing. I have been a fan of Morbid Angel since '91 and have always loved their ability to push the envelope and try different/unique/bizarre things with their sound. This album is no different and compared to 99.9% of the extreme metal coming out these days it is nice to hear a band who have been around so long and still try and keep things interesting and change things up. Personally I found Steve Tucker-era Morbid just as good as Vincent-era so when I heard he was back in the band it didn't really matter to me. Formulas and Gateways blew my mind and Heretic was really good too despite all the negativity that album has received! The death metal parts of Illud are what I have come to expect from Morbid. Insanely fast,brutal and well written. Tim Yeung does an excellent job filling in for Pete and Destructhor's \\"Blades for Baal\\" is one of my favorites off the album. The industrial/techno elements off Illud aren't that bad either! Better than most industrial I have heard. The only weakness on the album is Radicult. If that is what Vincent is contributing to Morbid Angel bring back Steve!!! It got a laugh out of me anyways. I don't think this album will make a lot of new fans and it is definitely going to piss off hard-core fans but it is worth a listen. Morbid Angel can make a country album and I will still be a fan. Give it a listen and make up your own mind! Individuality and not following along with the herd is what Morbid Angel have always been about. I just hope we don't have another near decade long wait before \\"J\\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004K4GDE4|4.0|Sadly, the record is censored. I don't think many small children will be purchasing and playing vinyl like this, at least not without the help of their parents.     The cover and sleeves were nicely designed, and aside from the censorship, the records are fine.
1594744769|5.0|Odd and intriguing...this one is full of mystery and mischief. The pictures just add to the unique and quite different storyline. Some are quite bizarre indeed! Don't be surprised if they show up in your dreams!<br /><br />Jacob has always listened to his grandfathers wild and crazy stories about his life growing up. The monsters he has fought and ran from. The war he was in. Jacob always listened and took it with a grain of salt. He was the only one in the family that would listen. Maybe that's why his grandfather chose him to tell all those stories to. Maybe.<br />Jacob had finally had it one day. He was tired of listening to the stories, they couldn't possibly be true. He had decided to confront his grandfather only to be shown the most bizarre and shocking photos. His grandfather came to rely on Jacob more throughout the years only trusting him instead of any other of the family.<br /><br />Jacob, receiving a frantic call from his grandfather saying that they have found him and have come for him, rushed to his grandfather's house only to follow the trail to the woods. That's where he found his grandfather. Dead. Looming above him...exactly what his grandfather had been describing all those years, and nobody would believe him. When Jacob tells what he sees, now nobody believes Jacob. Over time, everyone thinks Jacob has now lost it. Even he has come to accept it. But then, finally piecing together his grandfather's last words, he knows what he must do.<br /><br />He must go back to visit the orphanage where his grandfather grew up. He must find out about the people behind those pictures. They will have the answer. Except, when he gets there, he finds out that the orphanage hasn't been up and running so there was no way his grandfather could have been there....but he was....and somewhere....those children are still there...
0756404738|5.0|Can this man please write faster?    Just like with the first book, I could not put this book down.  Well written, well thought out perfection.    I just wish I had waited for the series to be finished before I started it.
B0032FMR92|3.0|So I almost got exactly what I was looking for, but first a little background.    My friend is leaving the state very soon and has recently become a huge fan of Game of Thrones. Having nearly finished the first book, I asked if he'd like the second one as a going-away present. He said yes and asked specifically that it be a hard-cover with the original cover-slip, meaning not with the artwork they use when promoting the show (as is often done when a movie/show based on a book is about to come out).    So I found this listing, saw that the cover provided in the image was EXACTLY the original, and ordered. The order came fairly quickly, which I was quite pleased about, until I noticed one tiny problem. On the cover was a large circle reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" \\"A new original series coming soon from HBO.\\" At first I thought it was merely an annoying sticker, but alas it was literally part of the cover art and thus impossible to remove (even though displayed for this order showed no such thing).    So, on one hand it isn't the cover art created from for the show, but on the other hand it isn't quite the original and still is indicative of the television series. Hopefully, it won't be too much of a problem though. After all, I'm not going to buy another as the first was expensive enough, and my friend is gone very soon so there is no time to return it. Long story short, I won't be ordering from this seller again so long as the product doesn't match the thumbnail.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|...it just isn't that good.  If you're reading this, you know by now that half of this album is way-out-of-left-field, industrial-sounding stuff that is barely listenable (even if you like that type of music).  The other half is decent, not great, death metal that feels more like a logical next step from \\"Domination\\": Existo Vulgore, Nevermore, and Blades For Baal - all of which are ok, but nowhere near what this band is capable of.  To put out an experimental and uneven album like this after a decade and a half long wait though, is a tremendous disappointment.  Experimenting with industrial music didn't work out well for Glenn Danzig in 1995, and it doesn't work out well for Morbid Angel now.
B004Y03LQ2|4.0|Iron Maiden are truly metal legends, they've been rocking and selling out arenas for decades. The iconic British band is also famous among fans for the many greatest hits compilations albums that they have released over the years. Another greatest hits album, From Fear To Eternity continues where Somewhere Back In Time left in 2008, covering the years 1990-2010. Somewhere Back In Time covered the 1980's, the band's early years and From Fear To Eternity covers the latter (and still quite good) Maiden years. This compilation take its clever title from the song \\"From Here to Eternity\\" which was on Fear of the Dark, plus I also have to admit the album cover looks damn good, real good.<br /><br /> Here is what is on From Fear To Eternity. From the band's last albums with Bruce before the reunion, we have three songs from the 1990 album No Prayer for the Dying and three from 1992's Fear of the Dark. The Blaze Bayley years are covered, with two tracks from The X-Factor (1995) and one from Virtual XI (1998). It's interesting how the Blaze Bayley era songs were replaced by live versions sung by Bruce Dickinson, Somewhere Back In Time did the same thing (replaced the Di'Anno songs by live ones sung by Bruce). I don't mind this as I really like those versions (especially Sign of the Cross) and to be honest it was kind of expected. The three live Blaze songs are all take from the excellent Rock In Rio album (2001).  The version of Fear of the Dark here is from the Rock In Rio live album as well which makes a total of four Rio live songs used. The reunion album Brave New World (2000) has 3 of its songs on From Fear To Eternity. Dance of Death (2003) and A Matter of Life and Death (2006) each have four songs. Last year's The Final Frontier has for its part, three songs on this compilation.<br /><br />I think what's on here is reflective of the best songs Iron Maiden released 1990 and onward. I personally prefer the band's 1980's era and albums but even judged on what they have released since 1990 Iron Maiden have been a strong band and released some great music and stayed true to themselves. There is an evident focus on the reunion albums, probably has something to do with Maiden's current Final Frontier world tour which focuses on the album from the last decade, the 00's. I for one, feel that Iron Maiden was great in their earlier years and that today they are still a very good band who is constantly amazing live. There are certain songs that I would have chosen over others but I feel that this covers the last 20 years of the band in respectable fashion and features many of the best songs that resulted out of those 20 years.<br /><br />From Fear To Eternity is an excellent overview of Iron Maiden's post 1980's and latter albums and is a good companion to Somewhere Back In Time.  These 23 songs offer a great look at Maiden's latter albums and has without a doubt some great songs. While someone could argue that SBIT has better songs, FFTE is technically a better compilation as it has 23 songs against SBIT's 15 AND is a double disc set. While I don't like the fact that there are so many Iron Maiden compilations out there already, I have to say that this one is good and is a little different in that it covers Maiden's post 1980's career, and does it very well I should add. From Fear To Eternity is nothing new for an old fan, no new song and it is just another compilation but as far as they go this one does exactly what it sets out to do: initiate new fans to Maiden 1990 and upward. 4/5 stars.90 Iron Maiden have been a strong band and released some great music and stayed true to themselves.

B001UW58WW|5.0|THIS CD IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE of all time ! Each song is VERY SPECIAL, I reccomend this CD to everyone I quarantee after listening to David play you will end up LOVING HIM & CLASSICAL MUSIC. His style is so unique very similar to my darling Andrea Bocelli, David introduces you to music you may not have considered listening to before. You will not be disappointed and come away feeling enchanted. The BEST experience ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I am not able to afford an iPhone, but my college son has one...how did that happen? Anyway, I thought that he might like the case so I chose this as my review item.     When I first gave it to him he was a bit ungrateful (another trait of his generation) Saying \\"Mom I have an \\"Outter Box\\" of course I had no idea what that was so he proceeded to drop his phone on the ground to demonstrate. He decided to try the AmazonBasic anyway when he saw the look on my face.     By the end of the day he came into my room beaming that he was starting to like the AmazonBasics case. It is lightweight, flexible, he likes the color and he said his ports are ready available. ( you have to lift tabs with the glorious \\"Outter Box\\" )He thinks that it is a very good product for the price. The only thing he didn't like was because of it's sleek design..dropping it wouldn't protect the screen as much.    If you are pretty good with keeping your phone on you and off the ground we highly recommend this product, but if you are a clutz who constantly drops your phone..maybe you should invest in the other product.
0061808121|5.0|Thanks for the fast service.  We just finished the novel in class. The CD made it so much easier.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|The movie was fast passed and full of action. I know a number of people suggested that the movie was too loud -I dont know about that, I mean it is a Sci-Fi War movie. Had it been silent I would have definately hated this film, so the explosions and all that wonderful action was fantastic. Some other viewers didnt like the dialogue, but I will have to agree with the people who responded to that criticism, you gotta know a Marine to understand -THAT IS HOW THEY TALK. I come from a military family, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner table talk is very stimulating. I love the idea of alien invaders coming to earth to colonize and kill the current inhabitants, I am just twisted that way.  What makes me even more insane is that I like it when the Alien Invader is more advanced than us limited earthlings. And I felt like these aliens -although armed to the teeth and kicking serious arse -their techonology seemed a bit off the mark. There was something that didnt fair well with me. I am thinking back to Independent's Day, where nothing we did could face off with the enemy until someone with some brains stepped forward and then we got them.  I think that is it. I like when Earth is threatened by impossible odds and suddenly thinking outside the box leads us to a triumphant victory.  I loved when the Bombers came in, that kind of stuff is exciting. Of course the bravery and self sacrifice of the soldiers was awsome and the only criticism I have about the troops is how this movie seemed to down play Michelle Rodriguez. Anyone who knows anything about Ms.Rodriguez, knows that she is no joke. She is always tough as nails in her movies, and in this one, I felt like she was forced to hold back. Other than that, the cast was great. Usually I like movies like this, but something about this particualar film did not move me like the others.
B003O86MY8|5.0|THIS CD IS AMAZING AS IS DAVID ! I'm so PLEASED with my purchase I can't say enough. He makes you understand and better still appreciate CLASSICAL MUSIC because of his own unique style and approach to the classics, LOVE IT !
0307279189|5.0|I have only read about half way through the book, but have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read. I am/have been training for my first marathon in hopes to get my BQ this year or next (I am 30). I ran XC and Track in high school and the D1 collegiate level and battled lower back pain ever since my freshman year in college. After a medical redshirt season, I left the team to run on my own (organized stuff turned out to be not for me). 10 years later, I decided to jump into this barefoot/minimalist running craze and purchased this book along with the Sacouny Progrid Kinvara and Nike Free 3.0 to start my transition to less shoe.     If you have ever been curious why you get injured so often from running, this book opens the door to why it happens. For thousands and thousands of years we ran barefoot, and ran everywhere we went. Until the 70s we ran in limited support shoes, then Nike came in with thicker soles and it evolved from there.     McDougall captured the true meaning of running, shedding light on why we should run and how we should run. I have always said to those that want to lose weight that running is the way to go, and he even talks of that (a small amount) in the book.     Great book and a must read for any runner! PS. I also got Pinole and Chia seeds because of this book too!
078322740X|5.0|Perhaps Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn's best roles.  Pairing them together was a stroke of genius (and luck, as Hawn was the producer's third choice).  Destined to be a classic.<br /><br />One disadvantage of downsizing films from theater screen to DVD is some action is edited out.  I noticed that some of Martin's physical comedy, such as during the hilarious party scene, doesn't show up when watching on a tv.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|Sad to say, this movie put me off instantly, during the opening credits no less.  I don't know if that was because I had no other reference point to go by, having never heard of Watchmen or the novel it's taken from.  This left me with no other option than what was presented.  They say presentation is everything, and in this case, Watchmen can't be faulted on style.  On everything else though, serious sensory overload: the music was too loud and intrusive, the undeveloped plot difficult to follow, the `mood' lighting completely left me in the dark (figuratively and literally).  The opening fight sequence was almost completely lost on me, seeing that it was purposely obscured, as was much of this film.  There were far too many flashbacks, hinting at what, most felt incomplete.  There were also far too many characters to juggle, most of them thoroughly unlikable and dealt with in a limited fashion.  It was difficult to pinpoint the villain of the piece as so many were villainous at one time or another.  When the `true' villain was eventually revealed he proved to be so bland and banal it made everything that had come before the great revelation completely laughable.  As the story meandered for 186 minutes I kept thinking, what's the point?  Even when it finally ended, I kept thinking, what's the point?<br />I found this movie smug, pretentious, humorless, and not a little snide.  Being dated was the least of its worries.  Alternate universe or not, it still had to battle for a modicum of relevancy.  And that droning narration throughout was of no help whatsoever.  I didn't just dislike this movie, I hated it.  Even on a cursory level, it failed to entertain me.  Not a keeper and I'm sorry I bought it.
0345529057|5.0|For a measly $20, you will get days to years of entertainment, depending on how fast of a reader you are. If you are at all prone to page-turning syndrome, it'll probably last you at least a few weeks. In those weeks, you will eat, sleep, and breathe these books. There are no more compelling stories, characters, and places than those you find in the A Song of Ice and Fire series anywhere else in the fantasy genre. This is the pinnacle of modern fantasy.    Its excellence is due to the fact that it is not bound by the limits of typical fantasy fiction. There are no archetypes and genre trappings ripped straight from Tolkien here: no elves and orcs, no magic swords or wands, and no black and white characters of pure virtue or pure evil.    What you will find is a rich tapestry of complex, flawed and very human characters struggling to find their way in a beautiful, but brutal world. Their internal and external conflicts will engross you, and you will find yourself becoming attached to them. And when you least expect it, you will find your heart broken as a character you love meets a cruel fate. And you will exult when another character you love finds an unexpected hope amidst the ashes.    Those who have lived life know that there is no true joy without sorrow; no beauty without ugliness; no good without evil; and no life without death. And because A Song of Ice and Fire never compromises when it comes to sorrow, ugliness, evil, and death, it rewards its readers with the true joy of the beauty and goodness of life.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|A rare movie, excellent entertainment, creative, fairy tale like and just a little raw around the edges. It is definitely adult because of the mature themes like a Grimm's Fairy Tale, so I don't recommend for your kids, period. DeNiro is a standout playing a very strange, sympathetic gay character. Pfeiffer is great as a beautiful evil witch.
B0046X4S3W|5.0|Although I got this Hollywood version at his concert a few weeks ago, I felt qualified to share my opinion on here. Michael Buble sings as great on this CD as he does in real life. He is an outstanding performer and singer. As my sister and I say, he is a canary with a golden voice. You just gotta love this guy!     Lets just say that his music never gets old and his cds take up slot 5 and 6 in my car. Yay to Michael Buble!
B004Q3SGWG|2.0|I'm not sure why this movie got such high reviews. I watched it with my girlfriend the other night and neither of us enjoyed it. The story line was adventure combined with an acid trip. I would skip this one.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Althought I live in the U.S., it was only during a recent family visit to Melbourne, Australia that I learned about this film!  I am a big fan of Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek, so I requested a copy of the DVD through my local library when I returned home to Wisconsin.  The based-on-fact film actually is set in rural Iowa and Wisconsin, and the pace of the story matches the slow unfolding of the country roads and two-lane highways that pass through some of the most quietly beautiful landscape that any Midwesterner can imagine (or grew up memorizing.)  \\"The Straight Story\\" brings us directly into the long end-of-life-journey home as one of two estranged brothers, separated by more than physical miles, stubbornly and steadily drives his old John Deere lawnmower all the way from central Iowa to the lush wilds of Wisconsin to try to make peace with his equally stubborn brother, played by Harry Dean Stanton, who has recently had a serious stroke.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film that allows us to watch as Alvin Straight pursues forgiveness and reconciliation with his brother, but leaves a wake of healing behind him as he passes through small towns and is rescued and gives rescue in equal measures.<br /><br />And oh, after I had to return the library copy of this DVD, I promptly went to Amazon and bought it for myself and my family.  It's just that important.  Do yourself a favor and take a trip with Alvin Straight in \\"The Straight Story.\\"

B003UESJJC|5.0|Apocalypse Now is firmly and rightly established as one of the great masterpieces of the art of cinema, and of the war genre in particular. Nothing more can be said to add value to the copious and deserved praise it has received as a great piece of movie-making, and great acting by numerous players.<br /><br />The issue to address, therefore, is the quality of this latest three-disc Lionsgate release on Blu-ray. This is as good as it gets -- current state of the art for a collector's edition of a great film. The set includes the original theatrical release and Redux, as well as Eleanor Coppola and Fax Bahr's excellent documentary about the making of the film, Hearts of Darkness. I already had the laser disc and two DVD versions of the film, plus the laser disc of Hearts of Darkness, but the three-disc Blu-ray release is a treasure of an update. Video and audio quality are superb. The many hours of bonus features include new interviews with Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen and John Milius. The packaging includes a collector's edition booklet containing interesting facts, documents and images.<br /><br />This release is a must for the collector and movie buff, and it will be a special treat for anyone coming to this film and its associated material for the first time.
B000RGGYI4|1.0|I bought the Delux version of this album. 2 CD set with Bonus tracks. Was so looking forward to this as I had not heard it for over 17 years. Imagine my horror on receiving the Package I inserted Disc 1 into my CD player and got the message NO DISC. I then tried my DVD player and once again NO DISC. I checked the Wishbone ASh forum and this seems to be a common problem with this set. I have written to Island Records about this problem and await their reply. AVOID THIS PRODUCT  ASIN: B000RGGYI4 Deluxe Edition, Original recording remastered, Extra tracks<br />Label: Universal<br /><br />I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT AMAZON REMOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM THEIR LISTINGS
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Harrison's debut book, Dragon bound, took me fully by surprise. This magical world of dragons, fae, & witches is thoroughly engaging, funny, and addictive. It also helps that the main couple's relationship is completely hot and endearing. Don't let the cover fool you, this isn't your run-of-the-mill flat PNR.  A must read for any PNR fan.<br /><br />Half-human and half-wyr, Pia spent her life keeping a low profile among the wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful-and passionate-of the Elder races.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case is a somewhat flexible plastic unit in a smoky gray color that encases the back and sides of the iPhone 4. The case has the appropriate cutouts for the camera, speaker, volume adjustments, charger plug, etc. It comes with a plastic screen, a microfiber cloth, and a rigid paper card which is used to affix the plastic screen to protect the front of the unit.<br />The plastic screen wasn't a snap to apply as it is a bit troublesome to align properly the first time out. However, once accomplished the case is easy to install because it's really flexible on the sides and sort of pops in. It ultimitely looks pretty nice and really doesn't interfere with operation of the phone while offering adequate protectn from scratches and marring. In the end all sides are covered and the case offers protection for the phone. I was glad to have the extra protection as my phone was only a few days old and my padded case didn't offer protection after I removed the phone.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|UNA MAGNIFICA SELECCION DE INTERPRETES CON GRANDES CANCIONES MUY BIEN FILMADO Y CON GRAN SONIDO TAN BUENO COMO EL PRIMERO
B00004XPPB|4.0|A great gangster / mafia movie with a high profile cast of actors. Unlike the benchmark of all mafia movies, The Godfather, which looks at the struggle at the top of the family, this movie looks at the trials, struggles and frustrations at the bottom of the criminal organization, mainly Lefty (Al Pacino's character) as well as Johnny Depp's character who is an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates the mafia and begins to have conflicting feelings and loyalties.<br /><br />The thing that really captured me the first time I saw this movie was that it was a very well direct and solid production. However, the one thing that makes me keep watching it over and over again has to be Lefty's character and what he has to go through... he is probably one of the most hard working members of the crew but is the first one to be overlooked and his personal life is no picnic either... even though he is a criminal, you will find yourself sympathizing with him and his situation. Especially when he begins to complain about it and how he is the one who is always being swept to the side, especially in the scene where he tries to meet the boss of Miami... that, for me was a real heartbreaking scene. You can't help sympathizing with Lefty even more because this movie was based on a true story.<br /><br />I guess now Al Pacino has played mafia characters at the two extreme ends of the mafia hierarchy from family head to solider.<br /><br />Johnny Depp's character also gained my sympathy where it got to the point where he was struggling to balance his home and family with his own sympathy for Lefty and his duty towards his job.<br /><br />I guess what I like about this movie is that it looks at gangsters and mafiosos as people in the end and that they are not devoid of their feelings and hardships... it is as if the director is trying to portray gangsters as people who are just trying to make a living (in their own different way) and are no different from your average working Joe who has to put up with the usual office politics and has to play the corporate game to get a promotion or a raise and meets with great disappointment and frustration..<br /><br />Overall, a great movie with great suspense, however does require close attention to the dialogue and events of the movie to fully appreciate the plot.<br /><br />\\"you said it yourself, you don't get uped, you're always looking over your shoulder... get out of this life is all I'm saying!\\" Donnie Brasco, A.K.A.

Let the world not forget back in 09' Steven fall off stage and needed recovery time, in 07' (guitar hero) they announced they would start working on a record SOON, not yet but SOON.

Of course its gonna take more time for a record to be made, their in their60's, steven has a second job (which is great) and also you notice steven has been getting songs made \\"love lives\\" \\"it feels so good\\"...

B001GKJ2ES|3.0|my review is based on the limited edition edition of WANTED.    if you want a review on the movie. go ahead and read someone else's review. theres plenty of them written.    the reason i bought it was because of a sentimental experience i had when i saw it in theaters. and ok, i admit that i am an angelina jolie fan.    i decided to buy the limited edition version because the image pictured for the product seemed nice. i dont really care for the film cell or the assassin's booklet that came with it. i do like the graphic on the dvds, and the card that was holding them inside.    what sold me for the limited edition is that the box looked nice and appeared to have a plastic cover that fitted over the \\"book.\\" the book box itself is built to feel like the old fashioned encyclopedia texture and feel. however, the plastic cover was nowhere to be found. the product came in plastic saran wrap, and the plastic case that was in the product image whether it be hard clear plastic or  just a plastic sleeve was nowhere inside.

B004KPLVV8|4.0|I bought this and Tron: Legacy at the same time.  My reasons for splitting up the purchase was both for price (cheaper separately) and reviews I had read about the packaging of the complete Tron set.  Most reviewers weren't happy with how the discs were stacked in the case (scratching, falling out, etc.)  This two disc set is placed back to back in the case, thus no discs on top of each other.  Now go play Space Paranoids!

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I seem to go through iPhone cases like I drink water.  I decided to go with two-part cases for my first two cases, one by iFrogz and one by incase.  The incase was superior to the iFrogz, but because it was a two-part case, it came apart easily.  The same happend with the iFrogz.  I can safely say that the AmazonBasics TPU case is the best I've used thusfar.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this.  I didn't really know what TPU plastic was, and was afraid it would either be too thin or too fragile.  The TPU is none of those things.  TPU stands for thermoplastic polyurethene, which is basically a bendable, but really durable, plastic.  There is just enough elasticity in the case to get it on your iPhone, but not so much that it feels like it won't protect it.  This balance is what impressed me the most.<br /><br />The cherry on top was the fact that the case is really subtle and attractive.  There is a simple spiral design on the backside that allows for the iPhones natural aestetic to shine through, while also adding a pattern which spices it up.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product.  The case has stood up to two accidental drops thusfar, and didn't even scuff.  This is my first Amazon Basics product, but after this, I don't think it will be my last!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|What's that you say? Goon Squad ain't science fiction? Science fiction has to have aliens. I suppose you're right. It certainly helps. What if your story predicts the future but has no aliens? Or faster than light space travel? Or brain uploads? Well, then your science fiction wins a Pulitzer.<br /><br />I jest, of course. No one in their right might would limit Goon Squad to the sf ghetto. It has  so much more going on in it. But with all the time slipping and fast forwarding and past wallowing, it feels somewhat science fictional. Time is very important in this story. The titular \\"goon squad\\" refers to the vicissitudes of time. And time is a component of any futuristic, i.e. science fiction story. So the case could be made.<br /><br />Is this book a time travel story? Not in the Wellsian sense. Time travel is not invented here. It is not discussed or used by the characters. But the reader travels through time. Backwards and forwards and we get to see the future.<br /><br />Goon Squad is a mosaic novel. I know that because I just picked up that term over at Interstitial Arts where they've got an essay on the topic. What makes this book a mosaic is that each chapter is a short story in and of itself. One chapter was in fact published as a stand-alone last year in some lit mag,  so there you go. Each little story has an arc and a main character. Each contributes to the main story arc but lives its own little life and its own little moment.<br /><br />By moment I mean point in time. It could be an hour, a day, a week, or even several months. All the moments together cover a time span of  probably thirty or forty years. Day one takes place at the birth of punk in the 80s.<br /><br />Of course Day One does not happen at the beginning of the book. The beginning of the book is Sasha's story which takes place about half-way through the novel's time frame.<br /><br />Sasha talks about her boss Bennie (a pop music mogul), her problem (kleptomania), and her date (guy by the name of Alex). In Sasha's moment she has just stolen a wallet out of a purse sitting on the floor of a restroom in a restaurant where Sasha and Alex are having their date. The woman whose wallet she has stolen panics and begs the other patrons to help her look for it. Stricken with guilt Sasha goes off to search and \\"finds\\" it back in the restroom. Sasha's moment is one of redemption. One of the few in the book.<br /><br />The finale occurs years later after Sasha has been fired from Bennie's operation for stealing, after Bennie's been fired from the operation for losing his touch, and Alex has dumped his own musical career. It is now Alex's moment. In an odd turn of events, he has met up with Bennie years after Sasha's moment. Bennie is attempting to make a comeback with his old friend Scotty -- a has been guitarist. Bennie and Alex no longer know where Sasha is. Alex barely remembers her name. We do not feel bad. Not because we didn't like Sasha, but the novel isn't just about her. It's about many people and how their lives intersect briefly with each other. At the novel's end, when we see Bennie and Alex discussing Sasha, we don't feel cheated that we're not actually seeing her again because her moment has passed and she's moved on in her life. As should we all.<br /><br />About a third of the way through the book, I thought I detected the usual flaw in multiple viewpoint stories: there's no one to identify with. Reading on, though, I realized that that is the strength of the book. Each story immerses us in one character's world. For that moment, the viewpoint is correct. When you switch to a new character you abandon the old one. You come back to that character eventually, but only peripherally. You're never again as cozy with them. It's like visiting a childhood friend as an adult, someone you haven't seen since you were a kid. You are tentative. You're not sure you want to be as close as you were before. Do you really want someone to remind you of your nerdiness? What about the pain you experienced when you said goodbye all those years ago? Do you really want to go through that again?<br /><br />The book is mired in tragedy. Characters are victims of their past: early encounters with fame, or other powerful effects. More than that, though, coursing through the story is the ever present goon squad. Time changes everything including our belief in ourself, our future, and the things we hold as beautiful. The tragedy is life itself.<br /><br />It's not all dark mood, though. The story has its moments of beauty as well. For instance, when Sasha, our kleptomaniac, devises a way to steal the sun. She is alone in Naples, friendless, moneyless, directionless. She gets by by stealing. It's obnoxious, especially when she steals from her own uncle. He goes looking for her (and his wallet), and finds her in a bare room. He sees the bleakness but also notices she has a wire bent into a circle hanging in the window. As the Neopolitan sun moves across the sky, it fits in the center of the wire ring. \\"See,\\" Sasha mutters, eyeing the sun. \\"It's mine.\\"<br /><br />The scene makes you cry.<br /><br />And then there's humor when the book heads into science fiction towards the end. The characters have made it through to the future world of pop music. Finally we get to see where we're all headed. What's it look like? Well, hit songs will not just sound like they were  chosen by two-year-olds as they are now. In the future they actually will be chosen by two-year-olds. The children will be called \\"pointers\\" because when they hear a song they like, they point to the ipod or whatever it is that's playing the music. Once a pointer has chosen a song, millions of dollars are spent promoting it and what do you know, it becomes a hit.<br /><br />So cynical. So hiliarious.<br /><br />More important and subtle is the depiction of how future online behavior is going to change. Everyone in the future Internetworld will be polite. No one will express a strong opinion. Humans will make their very non-private online lives private by keeping their personal beliefs to themselves. Gone will be the flame wars of today. The homogenization of opinion will be a result of our slow realization that whatever we do and say is being recorded, archived, and available. If you don't think this is a reasonable extrapolation, consider your own personal moment when you've come across a diatribe of yours from a few years, months, or days ago. Tell me you haven't learned to bite your tongue.<br /><br />The ending scene is priceless. Alex has thousands of online friends so Bennie hires him to create a viral campaign for Scotty. Using information on the likes and personalities of his friends, Alex knows who should be targeted and how to create a buzz before Scotty's first concert. It works. Scotty is an overnight success  created by the smart use of social media. The number one reason why they love Scotty so much? He's so honest and he never sold out.<br /><br />Actually that is true. Scotty never did sell out, but his people did.<br /><br />So the goon squad comes and goes. You can't hide but you know what? You'll survive. Just like real life. And without the help of aliens. - reviewed by Sue Lange, author We, Robotse all those years ago? Do you really want to go through that again?    The book is mired in tragedy.

B000KGGIQO|1.0|We bought this movie expecting to see a movie about Johnny Cash's life. And it had some decent parts, but this movie only tells about part of his life, in typical Hollywood fashion. My whole family is a fan of Johnny Cash, and the way Hollywood portrayed the Man in Black is almost sickening. Yes, he had a rough life, but he turned around. BIG TIME! If you are a fan of Johnny Cash and want to stay that way. I wouldn't recomend this movie.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|To see this movie in blu ray is a real treat. I have been a fan almost 30 years, saw in in the theater, then on VHS, DVD, and now blu ray. To say the least its one of the better blu ray transfers. Its not quite as good as say the Braveheart transfer, but the color and level of detail is in a word, stunning. The sound is considerably better as well. This movie was really made to be seen in HD, with all the nature shoots, the fantastic costumes, the battles, and the fantastic scenery of this movie is finally done justice. I am so glad that they decided to do this one in blu ray. There is a directors commentary and a theatrical trailer. This is the uncut version.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, here's a review from a busy young mom of 3 under 4 who isn't very good at keeping up with workouts. I purchased the 30 Day Shred on the advice of my mom, who was able two stick with it for half a year now and I can SEE the difference in her. She only does it 3 times a week. I thought, if my 50-year-old mom can do it, so can I. The price and the short workout time appealed to me. I tried it and after two weeks, I couldn't really see a change in my body (yet), but... I realized suddenly that my back pain was GONE. I've had lower back pain for a few years now and never found a solution to it. It had gotten so bad that I couldn't even lie on my stomach for 5 minutes, because it would leave my back painful and stiff for the rest of the day. Now I could SLEEP on my stomach for as long as I wanted, and feel fine.     Conclusion: Maybe you won't look like Jillian after 30 days, but you'll definitely notice a difference in your body's flexibility and endurance. It's worth it.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|This movie does nothing but look good.  The actors phoned it in, but at least they were nice to look at.  It felt like every cool visual you've seen in a dozen other movies got mashed into this one.The character development is non--existent;the plot- barely hinted at; and the pay-off- who cares?  Looks GREAT, though.  I'd watch it again... for free... with the sound off.
B0050N8N0Q|4.0|This album was not at all what I was expecting.  I also didn't like it at all, and even opted to cut it short on the initial go-around.  I was working late a couple nights later, and listed to the album in full.  It is really good.  There's some mediocre songs on there, but for the most part, it's a solid buy.  Don't hesitate to buy it if you get it on sale.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It grabbed hold of me the way a good adventure/sci-fi/fantasy should and never let go. What suprised me the most how romantic it actually got towards the end (I actually started to get misty eyed at various points. I deeply cared for the characters and they develop greatly throughout tge story. Along with the marvelous story, The Hunger Games has somethimg for anyone! Buy it now!
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|I absolutely love Rome. The sound conjures thoughts of galloping horses and dueling at dawn. I am not at all a spaghetti western fan, in fact, I almost avoided the album upon learning it borrowed heavily from the sound. But I'm glad I didn't let my prejudice get the better of me. This is a really cool album put together by master musicians.
B000063KG6|4.0|This is still a thrill ride. 1969. UK charts number six. Third album. Put your brain belts on and lock the doors. Who said Ten Years After couldn't trip you out? Just kidding--you'll be alright. They do play Three Blind Mice on the drums though. There's lots of musicality on this record, regardless of what people with better taste may say. Going To Try is classic TYA and then straight into a crazy piano jazz piece. Woman Trouble another jazz-blues of the later Me and My Baby type. Nice keyboards too. Hear Me Calling is a Canned Heat influenced number right down to the harmonies. Track 6--A Sad Song--Mayall style with organ/guitar riff. No Title would also make Mayall proud. Until it gets too loud. And maybe a bit touched. Bass and drum solos--everybody in. Speed Kills is a ramped up train song. Of course, pre-cd this is where the record ends. Splat. The bonus cuts have Hear Me Calling in the pounding single version. As well as the Woodstock face-melter I'm Going Home.  I don't think anyone was ever damaged by this collection of crazy. Tempered by time, this is a curiosity that I can still enjoy.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|After seeing the film I literally ran out to purchase the soundtrack ~  all the songs in the film were amazing to include \\"Chances Are\\" by Garrett Hedlund and \\"Me and Tennessee\\"  by Tim McGraw & Gwyneth Paltrow, which I catch myself singing quite often, but I was especially captivated by the duet \\"Give in to Me\\"  between Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester and really the reason I wanted the soundtrack.  The chemistry between them on this song was so hauntingly lovely and it was an intricate part of the film. So you can  imagine my surprise and disappointment to find that this song was replaced on the CD with a far less impressive version by Faith Hill, who I generally like, but NOT for this song. Besides the fact that she didn't sing it in the film, this song is truly meant to be a duet... Hills version sounds like a desperate stalker.  If politics were a factor it could have been done by McGraw & Hill... Although I honestly don't think it would have been or could have been any better than the original.  Why do record labels do this or allow for this? Most disappointed.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Great show, however the video quality isn't all that better than the DVDs, but the audio IS far superier. If you don't already own the DVDs, this is a no brainer. However, if you already have the DVDs, it is up to you if you think the audio upgrade and slight visual upgrade is worth the price. It was for me.

B000E41MS6|4.0|I remember catching a few episodes Doctor Who when I was younger and loved.  But after watching the new incarnation I am now an even bigger fan.
B003UZ46DY|3.0|Love Incubus, and Brandon Boyd is a big reason why. The songs here diverge from what you might expect to find on an Incubus album, but that is to be expected from a solo project.  It is a solid collection, but I would not say there was anything standout about this album.  However, if you are a fan of Brandon Boyd and Incubus the album is worth picking up.  I might have given it 4 stars, but I lowered it to 3 because sound quality on many of the tracks is just bad.  Especially the bass notes.  They tend to drown out the rest of the music and lyrics at times.  Not sure if this was intentional to give the album a \\"raw\\" feel, but it did not work for me.
B00008GKEG|5.0|So, like me, you probably know someone who keeps 'banging' on about the Beatles, and how they changed the face of popular music... blah blah! Well having watched this DVD set, I was totally blown away! It's not possible to write a review which adequately captures the impact that these four lads have made on the lives of countless millions. Like it or not, our world has been shaped by their music. It's not just a documentary... it's a life-changing event. This is THEIR story... so who better to tell it, than the fab-four themselves! Thank you John, Paul, George and Ringo.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|The material this is made of isn't as sturdy looking as the picture but it's still ok.  The product descriptions really need changed as there's no wallet with psychic paper, which I was very disappointed about.  There's no extras.  Just the screwdriver.  It's a cool toy though, making the right noise and light, and I really like the secret writing feature.  Although there is a light, don't expect to use it as a torch.  It's bright enough to look cool and to read the secret writing but it doesn't light up the room or anything.  On the whole, I'm enjoying the toy.

0345522478|4.0|Atticus O'Sullivan (now there's a name)is a druid, a 21 centuries old druid, living in present day Arizona.<br />He draws his power from the earth, has a magical sword and is \\"Hounded\\" by one of the Celtic gods, who wants the magical sword.<br />Now this could have been new twist on the magical practitioner in an urban fantasy novel (think Harry Dresden) but is saved from being just another in the genre, because the author has obviously done a lot of research and his use of humor is appropriate. Had me laughing out loud at one point.<br />So, Atticus doesn't take himself too seriously, is witty and entertaining, with a supporting cast of vampire & werewolf attorneys (an inspired casting), a possessed bartender and the Celtic goddess of death. Oh yes, and his shop assistant is a depressive, human goth.<br />The story is entertaining, how could it not be with this lineup of characters?<br />Looking forward to his next in this series \\"Hexed\\".
B001MS7IBS|4.0|'Aha! An X-Files ripoff' I said to myself after watching the first few episodes. But it's more than that. Add a little bit of 'Heroes', stir well or not so well and, depending on which episode you're watching you may find traces of 'Silence of the Lambs', Stephen King's 'Dark Tower', Men in Black, Ringu, FeardotCom, a lot of '24' and who knows what else? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and if the maker's claims of extraordinary insights and originality can be ignored, watching FRINGE can be quite entertaining, most of the time. For as long as you don't mind the \\"we are the government and we are here to help you and shoot a lot of people in the process\\" not so subtle subtext plus the \\"be VERY afraid of hostile and dangerous people hiding under your bed\\" subliminal message. And the implicit and sometimes open praise of the great and resourceful militaristic-surveillance-police state. And if some of the 'science' doesn't make you laugh rather than scare you or 'wow' you.<br /><br />So... the plot. Of course I'm not going to discuss details but we are talking one nice lady FBI agent and her partner who is not FBI but some civilian contractor (see? why claim it's an X-Files ripoff?) investigating all kinds of strange and bizarre occurrences. And their program is NOT called the X-Files, it's called FRINGE. And, yes, she does have to live with the consequences of some 'treatment' she was subjected to... but I will not go any further. Watch and learn or rather be amused. Add a recovering but still seriously troubled scientific genius who loves making incisions or sticking long needles in live bodies and chopping corpses so that the viewer appetite for 'gross' and 'shocking' is fully satisfied and... FRINGE is not that bad. In other words it's generally watchable, unlike most of the more recent TV series.<br /><br />The technical merit is so-so. Probably half of the action is shot either at the FBI site (office floor) or the mad scientist's lab complete with live cow and cute assistant - indoor scenes. Not too many special effects other than some cheap CGI - man turns into giant porcupine or man's face melts. The sound track on the Blu version is only a modest Dolby 5.1 and the picture quality on Blu is not much better than a DVD's. The extras are mostly about 'how and why did we do this' plus some scientists uncritically praising whatever 'ideas' and extraordinary insights could be derived from some of the episodes. I also didn't like the menu system much - on my PS3 it starts playing as soon as you put the disc in and it's harder to make the player do what I want than in most other movies on Blu discs - Season Two has addressed the problem which is a good thing.<br /><br />All the TV series that I watch I buy because I don't watch TV, having a strong allergy to commercials and in the case of FRINGE I bought the first 2 seasons. Now, after watching Season One and a couple of episodes from Season Two I'm not sure that I'll go for subsequent seasons. It's likely that I might if the price is in the 20's because they are cheap and, in spite of everything that I wrote so far possibly giving the impression of 'bad', there is SOME entertainment value in the series. It's just not as 'brilliant' or 'breakthrough' as its makers and promoters would want you to believe it is.<br /><br />For the time being, it's a 3-star (it's Okay) because I did watch it from beginning to end and stayed (technically) awake while watching it. It's not awesome or 'thought provoking' but it can be funny in some peculiar way. Sadly, it's not likely that I'll be watching FRINGE for a second or a third or n-th time the way I am watching the first 4.5 seasons of LOST (is there a way to erase seasons 5 and 6 from memory?), The Sopranos, Rome or the first couple of seasons of Heroes or Prison Break or... the X-Files.

0810971496|4.0|This is a great summer time fun-to-do do it yourself book for kids. They just love to fill this book. My son did not finish the book, he first got really enthusiastic of writing but then he left the book unfinished. It did keep his attention for a while.
0375831002|5.0|I have an interest in stories about World War II and particularly about the plight of the Jews at that time, which is probably partially what drew me to this book. But once I started reading it, I was very intrigued indeed. When I read some of the more intense parts though (like Max fighting Hitler and the Jews marching through Molching) I was overcome with emotion. I would've cried, except that that I don't cry easily. I was reminded once again of how horrible the Holocaust was. Maybe because the narrator is Death and he makes it seem more grim than we would normally think of it? I don't know.    The way I felt about this book reminds me of the way I felt about Tatiana de Rosnay's \\"Sarah's Key.\\" Before reading that book, I didn't know anything about the Vélo d'Hiver roundup, where thousands of French Jews - some born in France - were rounded up, stuffed in an old bicycle stadium, and denied food, water, and basic sanitation. I would've expected something like that to happen in an Axis country like Germany, but in France? I was amazed, and at the same time incredibly saddened.    This book takes the view of the non-Jew hiding a Jew, the \\"Righteous Ones\\" they call them in Israel, which you don't often get in these sorts of books (except in books like Lois Lowry's \\"Number the Stars\\"). I thought that was very interesting. As Zusak says in the interview in my copy of the book, he wanted to show that there were German people who didn't blindly agree with Hitler. I think he does that very well.    Then of course, there was Liesel and her book thievery. I liked that; I personally don't steal (nor do I approve of anyone else stealing) but I can see why she did it. It was very well-written.    Thank you, Mr. Zusak, for giving the world this book. I, for one, am very grateful for it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|In a world where filmakers just keep making the same junk over & over! Its great to have Harry Potter gives me hope that there are some creative minds left out there somewhere. I own all Harry Potter movies & have two more to see and then collect! Cant wait so happy I wont have to wait too much longer for the next installment!
1593272839|5.0|I must say I learned a lot and it was fun reading this book! It is very well written and presents a lot of material aimed to true beginners. Although it should be noted that it's not a text for beginners in programming, only for those who don't know Haskell. And the text really focuses on the language and skips unnecessary stuff, which is quite good because you start working with Haskell immediately. Another good thing of the book is the actual pace. The information comes at the right speed! You never feel it's going to fast or too slow, or that suddenly things become too complicated. It builds your knowledge of Haskell in the right amount, especially if you take some time to do some coding of your own. Only the last chapters of the book start to become more hard to grasp at a first reading because it deals with advanced concepts that will need more training from a beginner.     The author has a sense of humor while not filling the text with lots of jokes or provocative humor; it just feels natural. The cartoons that populate the book are not comics and just have a figurative role. I must confess that sometimes they just fill space but others they help making the reading more nice. My only complain with the book is the lack of coding exercises at the end of each chapter. This wouldn't be a complain if the book was more structured around mini-projects that would force you to code something larger than small functions. They exist, e.g., the task list, the calculator, but more would be a nice addition.    Did I learn Haskell with the book? Definitely yes! And it was fun! Naturally I'm still at a beginner's level but if I keep coding more in Haskell, I believe I can consolidate what I've learned and be ready to pass to a more intermediate level. I have not read other Haskell books but if you want to learn the language, have a good grasp of its capabilities and what you can do with it, this is a good book to achieve it and I recommend it without a doubt!    Disclaimer: Iwas offered by the publisher a free copy for review.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I played through quite a bit of this game in the first couple days I had it, its fun. However, when I went to play a few minutes ago, my profile was gone - of course along with my game progress. Me = Pissed. After Googling the issue, it seems its quite common. So, I refuse to play this game any longer until they learn how to properly store progress and issue a fix.
0312323867|5.0|Great follow-up to Something Borrowed. Such a great easy read I finished the book in 2 days.  Now lets just hope they don't destoy this story line in the movie version as they did with Something Borrowed.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is the same fun game as exists on other platforms. It doesn't have all of the features of the desktop version - fewer bonus/puzzle levels, no Zen Garden - but it does seem to have parity with the iOS version. Generally played smoothly - there was lag a couple of times, but not through most of the game.    The big downer is an easily-reproducible bug: If you take a call while playing the game, you'll lose all of your progress and achievements and have to start over from the first level. This is slightly annoying at the beginning of the game and utterly aggravating when you've finished and are playing the bonus levels.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|While I enjoyed the writing and the pace of this book--especially for light reading--I was very disappointed that it is not a self-contained work. Had the author given us more of a complete story, I feel certain we would still be looking forward to a sequel--or even a series. Instead we got what feels like a script for a season-ending television show. Take a lesson from Rowling. Her books each stood as a satisfying read on its own--but obviously left her readers begging for more without feeling like the abrupt ending we have come to expect from the idiot box. Now I feel as though I should have waited for at least two--maybe more--books to be issued before I started reading.
B004IFYMWK|1.0|The worst movie ever made. Only made it halfway through before quitting trying to watch the movie. This movie is considered an action movie and is far from it, all that's in the movie is talking. Nothing in the movie is exciting or interesting at all. It would make any talk show host look good. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS!
0451209338|4.0|DON'T Be put off by the naff title, the book itself is anything but.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process, Silva has dispensed with stereotypes and caricatures. Instead he takes us behind the headlines and into the heads of the players in this human tragedy.<br /><br />Both sides feature ruthless people, killers, but we understand what made them. They are damaged people, products of a cycle of violence none of them made but are trapped into continuing. Whether Palestinian or Israeli, they move in a world that makes them horribly alike. Silva shows the human tragedy of the conflict.

0061452068|5.0|I know this book is a bit of a lightning rod for people that see no \\"grey\\" in the world... I urge you to ignore the reviews of people that have some sort of an axe to grind.  They are just the sort of people you would not want to sit by on a plane, so why would you want to take their advice on a book?<br /><br />Anyway, the simple truth is that Matt Ridley bridges together science, evolution, philosophy, economics, and history into a beautiful thesis that makes sense.  It just makes sense.  I've read all of his books, and dozens others of this ilk.  Matt is among the best, and there is something in his voice that is refreshing and reassuring.  He knows this stuff inside out, and at the end of this book, so will you.  If you're an open-minded and rational person that can think for yourself, there's a new perspective here that you'll find intellectually liberating.
0143118706|1.0|I found \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" entertaining, though I wasn't sold on Gilbert's ideas and voice. It was funny and moving despite my objections and I thought I would give her another try with \\"Committed.\\" I realize I am coming at this from a biased perspective since my husband is foreign, but I felt not an ounce of sympathy for Gilbert in this book.     She is nearly forty, well-travelled, and obviously literate. Felipe checks those same boxes except that he's even older. What possible excuse do they have for not understanding basic immigration laws? When my now-husband and I decided to make our life here in America, we knew there would be rules. The forms you fill out as a non-US citizen on every arrival in America make it perfectly clear that the VWP is not intended to be permission for you to stay permanently in the US. Heck, you are not even allowed to stay for more than 90 days in one calendar year total, so Felipe was already acting illegally. And then Liz insists on calling his status \\"deported\\"; he was simply refused entry b/c what they were doing was illegal.     Liz lists in minute detail every single thing they had to do in order to get the fiance(e) visa for Felipe. Yes, it looks like a lot of work, but it's not that big of a deal. Put on your big-girl pants Liz; they even have a lawyer helping them. And then in the eleventh hour they still messed things up and realized they were missing a fairly crucial form. Newsflash, Ms. Gilbert: we were in our early twenties, and we filed for the exact same visa you guys did in the very same year, and we didn't use a lawyer and we managed to have no mistakes and no problems at the U.S. border and we also didn't whine about the process! She wasn't being singled out; the process she and we went through is for the benefit of the human beings involved on both an individual and national level. The immigration system is what it is and she isn't above the law just because she feels so special and non-conformist. Grow up Liz, learn to read the laws in front of you, and realize that you didn't go through anything that millions of couples aren't also struggling through.     Bottom-line: I found this book to be full of self-pity and regret reading the rambling protests of an immature self-proclaimed \\"Greek\\" non-conformist.

It would be even better if you could fast forward 10 seconds... that would be nice when you have to put on pause for a prolonged period on time, you could skip through commercials.<br /><br />The only con in my book is how short my battery life is, I don't think I'd be able to listen to my favorite 3 hour program without have to plug my phone in.
B004P9FAK2|5.0|I wasn't planning on reviewing for this, but I'm really sick of hearing about this, so here it is. There are no extended versions of Harry Potter movies 3-7 in existence. Please stop complaining about it; I'm so tired of seeing low reviews for these Harry Potter movies because these dim reviewers weren't smart enough to research before writing. Tell your friends about it so that this whining stops. Only the first two movies were \\"extended\\". When I say extended, I mean that they threw the deleted scenes into the feature film. Think about it.

0425242099|5.0|Surprisingly - happily pleased with Kiss of Snow (The story of Hawke (the Wolf Changeling Alpha) and Sienna(Psy Cardnial X). I read the book twice and its only been out a week!    I was actually scared to read this book. I was afraid of being disappointed.  I read alot of series paranormal romance books, and its always the one book that everyone cant wait for that is awful.  This was a plesant surprise.  I do not do 5 stars often. It this book warned it for me.    Hawke and SiennA are two differnet species, 14 years apart in age and have other personal issues that have keep them apart since the beginnig of the series. I was afraid it would be a cookie cutter of the other books with similar issues and it was not.  The progression of their relationship was well written and very interesting and I absoLutely loved the different nuances of their interpersonal interaction with each other, their familes and friends.  The changeling Leopard books did NOT have the same level of interaction with other than just the sentinels.      Hawke has always been one of my favorite characters and this book keep him right up for me. I like the Changeling Wolf stories and liked the character of the people and how they interacted with each other.  Funny, sad, poignant, loving, sexy...all the right notes were hit for me. Previous books always decribed him as arrogant, I thbink he's just wicked funny! Sienna was always background and she was written very well, and I really liked how she was 3 dimension.  Young and powerful but coming into her own, willing to listen and go for her man, but accept and move on if she couldnt! She was smart and willing to listen!!! but not be walked over.  Great balance in her charcter.. I went from not knowing how she could possible be written to make me care for her character and I really liked her and her and Hawke together.     It is SO hard to do this review without giving away spoilers but there are so many surprises, I would have been very upset had theybeen spoiled for me.    The advance of the story in genneral of the upcoming conflict between the psy and changelings and psy/psy escalated in a logical manner and on a larger scale...With some intersting twist..Many twist throughout the book.    Continuation of other chracters was just the right amount and fit in with the story.    Loved it......
B0034G4ORM|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies of the year.  Horrible story, cardboard characters, confusing action, and laughable acting.  My 12 year old son nearly fell asleep, it was so boring.  The only thing that kept us interested was the fun of correctly guessing which stupid line of dialogue the actors would spit out next.  People need to stop supporting these kinds of insulting time and money wasters.  I know I'll never watch another movie by this director.

0810989956|5.0|Greg Heffley is here to coach you through writing up your very own journal. Yes, this Wimpy Kid book, a revised and expanded edition of 2008's DIARY OF A WIMPY KID DO-IT-YOURSELF BOOK, actually stars you. To avoid the frightening sight of blank journal pages, which might trigger a terrible case of writer's block, Greg offers help on every bit of it, starting with the \\"What're You Gonna Do With This Thing?\\" introduction. Here, he tells us that you can write anything you want in this journal (you know better than to ever, ever call it a \\"diary,\\" right?). Greg says someday you will want to show this book to people so they can marvel at how wonderful you were as a kid, but he also cautions you to be sure you do not write about your feelings in it (but of course, because this is not a D-I-A-R-Y).    We start off with the topic of survival in the form of a question: Just say you were going to be stuck on a desert island for the rest of your life, what would you want to have? The categories for the fill-in lists are video games, songs, books and movies. Hmm...very thought-provoking! Next up is a little \\"tell the truth\\" exercise called \\"Have You Ever...\\" where we get to check off yes or no to questions such as \\"Have you ever tried to blow a bubble with a mouthful of raisins?\\" and \\"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\\" You may notice that some of these questions are extremely cringe-worthy, while making us laugh out loud.    Have you ever wondered what other people think of you? Do you yearn to know what you'll be like in 30 years? Greg has revelations for you when you fill in the answers to the Personality Test. Yes, your answers will reveal some stunning things about you (at least, according to Greg Heffley!)    I'm sure you've awakened in the middle of the night with an urgent need to write the captions for a cartoon, right? I mean, who hasn't? Well, in this book, you're given the opportunity to do just that. Greg helpfully draws out the cartoon for you, leaving the dialogue balloons empty for you to fill as you see fit. After you get the hang of that, you can compose your own cartoons, drawings and all, in the \\"Make Your Own Comics\\" pages. There's even a cartoon of your brain for you to fill in after you check out what Greg has in his brain. (You probably won't be too shocked to see that Greg's brain isn't filled with Algebra or classic literature. Instead, it leans heavily to video games, food and TV.)    Did you know that you can predict the future? Well, I guess anyone can predict; it's that \\"coming true\\" part that's iffy. In this book, you get several chances to predict what life --- and you --- will be like someday. As Greg points out, writing these predictions down gives you great ammunition for saying \\"I told you so\\" when all your predictions eventually come to pass.    Whether your predictions of the future actually come true or not, here's a prediction I feel free to make: Wimpy Kid fans everywhere will thoroughly enjoy filling out this hilarious and thought-provoking journal.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
1594744769|5.0|I know a book is worth recommending when, long after I've finished reading it, the characters seem to live on. Such is the case with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, written by Ransom Riggs.     The book follows the story of 16-year-old Jacob, who, determined to learn more about his grandfather's mysterious past, leaves his home in suburban Florida for an adventure on a deserted island off the coast of Wales. Before long, he discovers the time-ravaged remains of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, an orphanage for outcasts with strange attributes and abilities. Among this cast of characters is Emma, a human torch who can hold a ball of fire in her hand; Enoch, a little bruiser who can animate toy soldiers with the hearts of mice; Olive, a levitating girl who must be belted into her chair at dinner, lest she float away; and Claire, who has a \\"backmouth,\\" which is exactly what it sounds like--she has a second mouth in the back of her head.    Riggs is a collector of oddities, and this book is packed with wonderfully haunting found photographs of peculiar children who match the descriptions of the characters inside. Thanks to vivid descriptions, compassionately drawn characters, and a suspenseful narrative, the story could exist on its own and be just as powerful without the photos, but the bound book is a beautiful package--a physical object worth buying and saving.    Miss Peregrine's is clearly meant to be enjoyed by young adults, but older adults who grew up reading fare like The Indian in the Cupboard will find it just as entertaining--at once a throwback to the kind of fantasy books that require the reader to bring his or her own imagination to the story, and a giant step forward into a brand-new world that Riggs himself has created.    For those who are wary of the fantasy genre, have no fear. A lucid and lyrical storyteller, Riggs has created a world without getting trapped in it himself. Instead, he tells us what we need to know in orderto understand this strange island and care for the peculiar, amazing, enchanting kids who inhabit it--ultimately leaving us wanting to know more.     I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I was really interested in seeing the film, after reading the book.      Although the film was very good, it wasn't entirely true to the book, as it completely missed out one of the characters who died alongside the others.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This runs fine on my Vibrant, but I'm running the Bionix ROM. All vibrant owners should be running Bionix in my opinion.   The game is a lot of fun and the touch interface adds a different, but good, dynamic over the console version.  I don't think this has extras like zen garden, but perhaps I just haven't unlocked that yet.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|its a great carrom game too. Realistic physics and beautiful graphics. Wish real boards came with the assist lines :)
B000003337|5.0|Took a chance and bought this as a present for my partner. Best chance I ever took. He loves it. This is a must for any Randy Rhoads fan!
B003OFVIXG|5.0|This ch is a surprise. You know when you buy cd from favorite singer, and it turns out it has 2-3 good songs you end up listening? This one is nothing like that, you just need to listen it all, over and over again!
0143118706|4.0|I love reading Ms Gilbert's books. Her narrative is easy, very entertaining and funny.  Enjoyed her historical pointers and statistics. Overall - I understand her apprehensions and identified with the demanding aspects of being a woman  and professional. Very enjoyable.
0670022411|5.0|Just loved this book.  And I loved that the author spent so much time developing the characers.  Who wants to read a short book?  I find those so boring.  When I read I want to enter into the story.  I feel I could step straight into the book.  I can't wait for the next one.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|I am always pleased when I hear AA and the band delivers the gold once again. In fact, this might be heavier than previous efforts. (I got the special package w/ bonus dvd.) Terrific songwriting and blistering guitars!   Possibly one of the best albums of the year.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|After years of waiting, its finally available! One of the all time classic shows! I saw this first in a theater in San Diego California back in 1981. I still have the ticket stub as it resembales a concert ticket. Bought the VHS when it became available a year or so later, and literally wore it out. Now FINALLY on dvd!   Yes, its a bit pricey for the contents in this nice tin box, but what the heck its AC/DC with Bon Scott! Say what you will, but I am nowhere near a fan of Brian Johnson as I am of Bon. AC/DC is, and always will be the best with Mr. Scott.   Very nice job with the video and audio on this dvd, box contains a handful of stills from the flick, a decent booklet, guitar pic, and card. All housed in an embossed black tin with Angus's classic pose. I would love to have seen more, but I'm not going to complain, waited to long for this to hit the streets.   I'm in my early 50's and rock just like i did when i was 21 and saw this for the first time! If you are a fan of AC/DC, and classic hard rock, this is a must!!!!   Enjoy!    PS. forget the dvd extras, all you need here is the flick!
B004VUP8WK|1.0|To say that this is horrible would be an understatement. MA has disappointed their fans with this less than mediocre recording. I have been listening to metal for nearly thirty years now and this might be on the top 10 most useless metal albums.  If you like half baked attempts at industrial, you might like this.   Spend your money on ...well, anything else. I lost faith in this once mighty band.  As for those saying this is great, they clearly have never heard MA before.  AVOID !!!!!
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|After some R.E.M. albums that I didn't like so much, this is the album that brings them back to the top.  Nice songs, which should get a lot of airplay on the radio (at least, that is my opinion).  This is their best album since Monster.
B00000DHR0|5.0|My nephew loves Celine Dion's music. He has every one of her CD's. When he asks for it as a gift, I always use Amazon because they are easy to access, provide quick service and have what I need.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This is great. For real fans of the Boss, this is a must have.  Great artwork for a great album. Extra's are also fabulous.   The book really gives you an insight of what was going around in the head of Bruce at that time.   Nice that there is a bootleg added to this box.
B004J2TPSI|5.0|Works good once you get the knack.  After you've synced the unit to your wireless headset, it's best to turn on the headset first, then the adapter. It connects right away.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|This is great. Really, this is the best ever music DVD.  What a performance, what a crowd. The older Bruce gets, the better are his concerts.  Wish I'd been there...
140131046X|5.0|This was such a deeply touching book, with powerful, yet gentle lessons for life, that I ordered eight of them to be sent to special friends. It is one of those MUST reads - stories written as only Mitch Albom can write them.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I bought \\"Born This Way\\" on the day it came out after I got off of work, listened to the entire CD on the road back home, and felt overwhelmed. I had enjoyed the music but I knew I hadn't yet experienced the album. So, finally, after digesting everything that \\"Born This Way\\" has to offer through multiple listens, I declare it an epic experience that is easily Lady Gaga's best output thus far.    With 17 complex and multi-layered songs that touch on many subjects such as love, death, self expression, self confidence and empowerment, sexuality, fashion, and religion, this album proves that Lady Gaga is in a league of her own in todays pop world. Not many can touch what this woman has to offer. With \\"Born This Way\\", there's a huge and edgy sound(curtesy of RedOne, DJ White Shadow, and Fernando Garibay) enveloping gritty and clever words that together reek of Gaga, and it smells like a confident and unique monster with the attitude of Metal, and it cannot be confined.    There's the obvious Madonna influences(who I am a huge fan of) on 'SchieBe'(Erotica-era breathy monologue) and 'Fashion of His Love'('Dress You Up'), while 'You and I' is reminiscent of Elton John and Queen. I am a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band so I love the fact that Clarence Clemons plays sax on 'Hair' and 'The Edge of Glory'.    Overall, \\"Born This Way\\" holds a lifestyle of it's own. One that I can live only through this album. A sort of New York nightlife of black leather, motorcycles, raunchy love and wildly colorful hair...a 5 STAR good time!

0385523912|4.0|Wow, what an eye-opening book this was!  It's no wonder that I don't know much about North Korea, it doesn't seem like much information gets in or out of this locked- down country.  It is truly amazing that an \\"industrialized\\" country can be this oppressed and backward in the 21st century.     It was mind-boggling to hear how this country is run.  Electricity is only available for short amounts of time during the day ever since Russia and China stopped subsidizing their electricity.  They have to have travel passes to go from one city into another, it is illegal for private individuals to own a car, there are few televisions and everything that is broadcast is government produced or distributed, few have computers and no one has access to the internet. There are still huge food shortages, even though the famine of the 1990's is technically over, and malnutrition is still very high.  The list of things they don't have or can't do goes on and on.     Demick tries to cover a lot of ground in this 294 page account, from background history on how Korea was split, and other contextual information on how the government is run, to historical information about specific cities and regions, to the personal stories of her main 6 characters, to background stories of their family members and friends, to details about the famine.  Her narrative goes back and forth between all of these different stories and accounts, as well as between time and region, and honestly I got confused a lot about who was who, or who was whose daughter, and who was whose husband.  I found this to be the only real flaw in the book.    Overall I thought it was an insightful, informative look into one of the last Totalitarian regimes in the world.
015603008X|3.0|What Keyes sets up to do is just too ambitious.  No one could do it.      To start, as per the story, Charlie is not a likable character.  He is either too smart or too stupid.  It is impossible to relate to him.  In one scene, he defecates in his pants because he is being taunted.  In another scene, he is speaking of a technical journal written in some Indian language.  I've known people with Down Syndrome, and have even seen groups of other kids picking on them, but I've never seen one defecate in his pants.  Not only is it inhuman, but, in the same situation, animals don't even relax their bowels.  It is just bad technique to make the main character soil himself.      Secondly, it is a sob story.  As a novel, that makes it difficult to read.  Maybe, it works better as a short story; I don't know.    Finally, the ending comes as no surprise.  The book is too famous.  Likely, you know the ending before you open the book.    The \\"mortality of the mind\\", as I would call it, is an interesting theme.  And many other people have liked this book, but, to give you my unqualified opinion, it lacks the necessary elements of a good story.  The best writer in the world could make it a good story.
1400052181|3.0|Since I knew nothing about HeLa cells before reading this book, I found all of the information about the cells very interesting and informative.  It is truly amazing all of the research that HeLa cells have been used to develop from vaccines for polio to nuclear weapons and just about everything else in between.  Her contribution to science is immeasurable.      I also liked learning about Henrietta Lacks, the woman whom the immortal cells were taken from.  I did not however, find her family's story that interesting nor did I think it added to the story of the HeLa cells.  A brief summary of her children's lives would have been enough to give the reader background about their frustrations of having Henrietta's cells being used without her permission and with no compensation to the family while research and pharmaceutical companies made millions of dollars using her cells.    I found the afterword to be particularly interesting because Skloot looks at the ongoing debate in bioethics over who has what rights over an individual's body tissues and subsequent research and commercialization of those tissues.  These are important issues that need to be publically addressed and debated and formal legislation should be enacted so everyone is on the same page, and the public will know what their rights are when it comes to disclosure, consent and future use or compensation for of their contribution.      This is an easy, but informative read by an author who's passion for the subject comes through.  Just wished she had stayed a little more on target with the subject of the HeLa cells and not veered off so much into the personal lives of Henrietta's family which detracts rather than adds to the veracity of the book.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album was a great find for myself. I love looking for new artist and finding a cd that you can keep listening to and where you love the songs even more each time you listen to them. The band and their music is a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this band to anyone who enjoys music. I can't wait for their next album.
B001AQMBJG|3.0|I am not going to review the movie which is one my favorite movies (most people compare it to the book and rate it very low) maybe it's because I have not read the book, I think the movie works. Bluray transfer is great but there are no special features. For such a classic movie, I expected some commentaries, featurettes to satisfy my appetite but there is nothing (except for the 45 seconds trailer of \\"making of Lolita\\" which consists of shots from the movie). If you wish to buy the Bluray because of its picture/sound quality, go ahead. But you won't find any extras on this edition.
0385737955|1.0|This book is garbage. Its completely depressing, sad beginning, sad ending.... one of the worst books I have ever read. Just another remake of Lord of the Flies, except they arent saved in the end....crap
1423113381|1.0|I agree with the other 1-star reviews and everything they've said (lack of character development, repetitive plot, etc.) so there is no need to restate what has been said.  I'm about 2/3 done and am going to trudge through it because my son is also reading it and he enjoys discussing it.  I, like the others, was excited to read this after really enjoying the Percy Jackson series and the Lost Hero.  Yaaaaawn.  I already bought the second one, figuring my son and I would also read that, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it through it.  :/
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Sure, it lags ridiculously on the victory screen. If this gives you an inferiority complex over your friend with an iPhone, get a freaking life. Is the game is,  or is it ain't awesome and fun? I insist it is. Your 1 star reviews are whiny boolsheet.

B004OWPWEO|5.0|I'm listening to the transcendent \\"Kitty's Back\\" on this set as I type. Big Man has just ripped a ferocious four-chorus solo, and I'm drenched in joy.     Six months before Born to Run appeared, a month before Steve Van Zandt joined the band, shortly after Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan became permanent members, Bruce and the band played the late, lamented Main Point, a club outside Philadelphia that sat maybe 250 people. WMMR-FM Philadelphia (when MMR still WAS \\"the radio station\\") broadcast it. For months, maybe years afterward, the station would play \\"cuts\\" constantly. It's a \\"soundboard\\" recording, but the quality--except for some muddiness in an otherwise unbelievable \\"New York City Serenade\\" and a suitably unhinged \\"Rosalita\\"--is sparkling clear.     As a bonus for all you WMMR-ites, you get a few seconds of the late Ed Sciaky doing the introduction.    The yearning, joy, sweet melancholy, freedom (great as he has often been, he and the band have never been as free nor allowed themselves quite the abandon they had before Darkness on the Edge of Town--and it's too easy to forget how tremendous a saxophonist Clarence Clemons is) and sheer ambition on display throughout this two and a half hours is no less than balm for the soul. More than that for this reviewer, this set--played as MMR relentlessly rotated it back then--along with Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes almost literally saved my life in an extraordinarily dark time.     If you dig Bruce at all--and especially if you treasure the Born-to-Run-and-before Bruce--just buy this.
B000O179FO|4.0|I had been searching for this movie in stores for two months never thought on checking out Amazon.com until it was mention to me by a family member.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|Until my purchase of this wonderfully directed and acted First Season of \\"Torchwood\\", I had never purchased or viewed any series that deals with the \\"catching of Aliens\\"(no \\"Dr. Who\\").  After reading the reviews herein to \\"Torchwood\\" including the ones that referred to a \\"Gay Agenda\\" in the programs, I knew that I had to see this series.  I am very glad that I have procured this seven (7) disc set with thirteen (13) episodes.  I found this season to be most exciting with many splendid and \\"eye popping\\" special effects and some very fascinating characters.  I especially adore the character of Captain Jack Harkness, as played by John Barrowman who is the leader of the \\"Alien catching\\" team.   Barrowman is very tough but so suave--he's great.  Based on this first season, I fully intend to add more seasons of \\"Torchwood\\" to my DVD collection.
0061990477|5.0|This book is filled with passion and emotion and I couldn't get enough of it.  The book is incredible and beautiful.    There are very few characters that I completely disliked.  They are all different from one another and ll had their positive traits.  Maggie wasn't my very favorite, I feel she lacked depth.  True, the authors intent was for Maggie to be naive, yet I can't help but feeling she has little personality.      The Father was my very favorite.  His entirely personality is based on being ardent.  He has will and reason.    The book is extremely philanthropic.  I recommend this most highly.
B000026OW3|5.0|Being a rather rebellious teenage piano student, many years ago and much to my piano instructor's chagrin I purchased, on LP, all of these marvelous recordings of Artur Rubinstein playing of Chopin.  Although, my piano teacher was a \\"member\\" of the anti Rubinstein \\"crowd\\". I rebelliously purchased all of his recordings that I could get my untalented hands on.  Thus, on separate LPs, I acquired all of these wonderful recordings that are on eleven (11) CDs in this collection.  At the very low cost of $22.97, I just could NOT resist restoring these marvelous recordings to my collection.  I enjoyed these recordings so many years ago (Nocturnes, Mazurkas, Ballades, Scherzos, Polonaises, 2nd and 3rd Sonatas, Waltzes, Impromptus, Concertos, Preludes, et al) and now I am really enjoying them in their digitally remastered \\"state\\" on these CDs.  The sound is so full and rich and Rubinstein's sublime piano artistry comes through marvelously.  I just loved hearing these recordings again.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I am continually amazed at the consistency of great music this band keeps putting out, and the new album is no exception.  This was well worth the wait.  I continue to be impressed with their choice for album openers, and Bridge Burning is, I think, one of their top five songs ever.  There's no letdown with the next song Rope, either.  I believe this was the first single released, and it's a good choice.  Dear Rosemary slows things down a little, but still a great song.  I totally love White Limo.  It's just a fantastic hard rock song, which is the stuff I tend to like best from the Foo Fighters.  This one reminds me of Wattershed off their first album.  Arlandria is steady and interesting, a nice bridge to three brilliant songs: These Days (slow start that really kicks off) and Back And Forth and A Matter Of Time, two songs I absolutely love, especially the latter.  Miss The Misery continues the brilliance.  If there's one song I'm not too crazy about, it's the next track I Should Have Known.  It's just a little too slow to me, but not bad.  And lastly, I really like (and my wife loves) the last track Walk.  It's a perfect closer, full of hope and energy and finding your strength.  I'd say this is one of the Foo Fighters best albums, but that would discredit any of their previous work, and everything they do is fantastic.  This is the best American rock band out there right now.  Long live the Foo Fighters!!
0739368435|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows had been recommended to me many times and I actually tried reading it about a year ago. For some reason, I just could not get into it and put it aside, assuming I would pick it up another time. While in the library the other day, I noticed the audio book and decided to give it a try and I am thrilled that I did. Not only was it a wonderful story, but it was the whole package. The book, which is written in the form of letters and telegrams was read by five talented \\"actors\\" whose voices and accents added a great deal to the already charming story.<br /><br />It is January 1946 and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject when she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a man that she had never met. Dawsey, a farmer living on the island of Guernsey, a Channel Island located 70 miles off the coast of England had come across Juliet's name scribbled inside a book by Charles Lamb. Through her correspondences with Dawsey, Juliet is introduced to the many colorful residents of Guernsey and learns about The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society, a literary club formed out of necessity during the German occupation of the island.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society is a delightful story about a difficult time in history. I fell in love with the many residents of Guernsey, laughed out loud at times and cried at others. I would love to have met Juliet and hope that one day the book will be made into a movie. I listened to the book in my car as well as on my computer while in the house. It truly is a great audio book.<br />[...]
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Let's cut to chase. These are absolutely astounding headphones for the modest asking sum of $35. If that's your budget, you cannot do better.    FIRST IMPRESSIONS:  I was ambivalent about subjecting my Sennheiser curated ears to this unfamiliar brand Superlux. Indeed, first impressions weren't too encouraging when they arrived in mail. The packing material is essentially a cheap looking shrink wrapped cardboard sheet. Yes, a sheet - it isn't even a box! It's a very green approach to packing, but I digress. Onto the actual cans. They are huge with a well built feel to it. Notice I didn't say \\"well designed\\" because they look like a carbon copy of the superb AKG Acoustics K-240  that go for a very reasonable $89.99 plus shipping on Amazon. I suppose imitation is a best form of flattery and I'm certainly not complaining!    THE SOUND:  Here's the part where I mull over it's sound signature using the usual suspects from AKG, Sennheiser, Shure and Grado for comparison. Or gush over it's soundstage, it's ever so exaggerated highs, it's bass or... Yes, it does have very good bass! It's extended, controlled never overblown or boomy. Monitor headphones, these are not, despite the decal saying so. If you're looking for your music to be faithfully reproduced with no coloration, you'll be best served looking elsewhere, albeit with a larger budget!     COMPATIBILITY:  I was surprised at how easy these cans were to drive with a humble ipod.  Despite having large drivers, a dedicated headphone-amp is not necessary for casual listening. I use it for music with a Creative X-Fi soundcard under Windows 7 using Foobar for playback.    CONCLUSION:  Trying not to grin too much from listening a FLAC encoded \\"Hotel California\\" from \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" by Eagles with these phones. Think I'll get back to doing that.  ....buy these!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This incredibly lush universe was so fantastic in its creation, so bold in scope, and so chock full of ambition that the producers at the network pulled the plug midway through the first season. Each episode is largely standalone, so the only thing that suffered was the overall story arc of where these wonderful characters were ultimately headed, as well as backstory from which they found their place on serenity, and why they are, say heroes of a mud planet. The overall theme of the show is about a group of super lucky thieves with hearts of various precious and unprecious metals, that always make it out alive, but almost never score the loot in the process. Super lucky to live, super unlucky to be happy and at least comfortable. Ironically,  the shows financial backing took that theme literally and stopped funding.    Do yourself a favor. Watch this show. Its on Netflix. Do joss and Nathan and super lovely jewelry a favor and buy the (admittedly backwards) DVD. Show it to your friends. Show it to your neighborhood.  Tell them to buy it too. Then watch serenity. With chewitel ejiofor. He's just as awesome.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game truly comes across to me as an alpha release at best.  I didn't have the naive slowdown at the ends of levels as some have described.  Go Hummingbird.  But I often found that when I closed the app, the phone was going through it's boot animation, which seemed very odd.  Then one day it froze completely.  I gave it plenty of time, but to no avail.  The phone wouldn't respond to any input.  After about 15 minutes, i pulled the battery.  It rebooted into safe mode, which I didn't even realize Android has.  Any way, after the next reboot, the phone started immediately showing force closes for what seemed like ALL my apps.  This kept happening, I had to use clockworkmod to revert back to a recovery image.
B000P0J09M|5.0|After the Godfather saga, I consider this to be the best mob movie in America, although, this movie is based on a true story. The movie is centered around a former mob guy turned informant, Henry Hill, who lets us spectate through his eyes as to what mob life was to him through the 50s to 80s. It shows how Hill got involved with the mob at an early age, until he became a man being involved in hits, murders, robberies, and becoming a government witness. Also, shows the benefits of being a mob guy like eating well in large prison cells, and front reserved tables at the Copacabana with no tabs.    Cast and characters you have Ray Liotta who does an awesome job playing Henry Hill, as Hill also gave credit to Liotta himself in a documentary. Hill also gave, one of the world's greatest actors, Robert De Niro, a great deal of credit for his portayal of Jimmy Conway, a good mob earner. Joe Pesci's character, Tommy DeSimone, was very scary as he was a gun toting, careless lunatic. Pesci did a terrific job and was my favorite character throughout the movie cause you never knew what he was going to do next. Lorraine Bracco (Tony Soprano psychiatrist) makes her first recognizable film role as Karen Hill, Henry's wife, as she becomes an outrageable wife stressed from the dangerous life of Henry, and the things that come with it like late nights and other women.    What I love most about this movie is you really get that feeling of what it was like in the fifties and seventies, and that unforgettable music that will really attract your attention. Also, you can choose an audio option where the real Henry Hill is given commentary throughout the whole movie, and tells his experience of the moment of every scene in his own words which was very entertaining. Great movie, great DVD!
B000GRUMPU|3.0|this movie gets a lot of badmouthing because of the premiss that only a few people survive. get past that, folks...this is not taken from real life events. it is a movie, for entertainment. i would honestly give it 3.5 stars, but you do not have that feature on here. it is fun, exciting. i love that the actors do the majority of their own stunts, even the little kid. it is a big bold flashy over the top movie. just the thing for a rainy afternoon.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The thrill about board games is to be able to experience an enjoyable experience for just the right amount of time. Some take too much, some too little. Settlers of Catan brings fun in the perfect timing, and if you wish for more you can always set up the board a different way and play it again!<br /><br />When you first look at the instruction booklet you think it is gonna take you ages to figure out all the settings and rules but in a single match, you and your friends will be following along, trading goods, finding their way through Catan's land.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I love how incredibly comfortable Tom's are. They are really the perfect slip on shoes for summer. That said, I WAS pretty disappointed how quickly my first pair wore out, but I miss them so much, I am buying another pair despite their short life. I just hope the shoes they gave to the \\"children in need\\" are a lot sturdier than the ones they sell to us!
B00275EHJG|1.0|Toy Story 3 was a traumatic experience for me. The villain is too real, and triggered flashbacks of abuse. Maybe I'm spoiled by the considerate nature of the internet's fiction community, but if TS3 had been a fic, the mods would have come down hard about abuse warnings and trigger warnings for the villain and the whole chunk of the movie that takes place in the daycare centre.<br /><br />Aside from that, I did not like the message that everyone gives up their toys in order to fully grow up. I feel it's a bleak message for children to be told that they must leave everything behind, or inevitably will. Personally I know many people who have held onto and still make companions of their toys, and still use their imaginations. It just seemed forced, to me, that Andy gave up his toys. There was no real reason for him to do so, so the fact that he did felt out of character, especially after all the build-up of him looking for them.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|This product worked great the first day.  Then after that it would not charge my iphone It will allow me to play music on my iHome but not charge.  I still get a message that states it is not compatible with my iphone 4  I am unhappy with this product.
B003GDYN24|1.0|I'm a broad minded person when it comes to music, and after reading other reviews on here regarding this album, I bought it without hesitation after all I'm a huge Kelis fan. Much to my amazement this is the absolute WORST Kelis album I have ever purchased. First of all you should be warned that this album is on that Techno-Euro bullcrap, there's not one single R&B track on here. I sorted through the album hoping that I'd hear something that would remind me of her soulfulness especially since she was going through a nasty divorce with Nas (normally hard times brings out the best out of artists) but in this case my dear Kelis threw a curve ball. If I'd known earlier that she was on that Euro-Techno tip on this album, I would've never bought it; It's just not my style of music and everybody should'nt try to be Lady Gaga. Although Kelis seriously hurt my feelings on this album (lol), I'll still forgive her and hope for the best from her on her next album. I maintain that I'm a huge Kelis fan and I absolutely love her whole style and music, but she owes her core fans a huge one after dropping this album. We'll be here waiting patiently Kelis......
B0049YU4HC|1.0|I bought this watch a couple of years ago and the battery stopped working in it after a year and a half.  Of course, since I bought it from a store on a Norweigen Cruise ship, it was not covered under warantee.  So I called the service center to see how much it would cost me to get the battery replaced and the watch resealed so that it would maintain it's water resistance.  The rep told me $45 plus shipping.  I sent the watch off and after one week I get a statement for $367 in repairs for the watch.  Wow, what a deal, I paid $400 for it and I get to have it working again for only $33 less than what I paid for it.  The Swatch repair center is the biggest rippoff place I have ever seen.  If you are buying a quality watch, then it should have quality customer service.
0316098329|5.0|What an amazing, disturbing book!  Told in first person point of view, the protaganist is five year old Jack.  Jack lives with his Ma in Room.  Ma was taken captive seven years previously, at the age of nineteen, by \\"Old Nick.\\"<br /><br />Room is the only home Jack has ever known and Ma has been fiercely protective in keeping him safe and contented in his very small world, even as she endures the horrors of their existence.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILER ALERT:<br />And the problems don't stop once Jack and Ma escape from Room.  Jack has to deal with a world he is basically being \\"born\\" into at five years old and Ma has to deal emotionally with all the horrors she has endured for seven years.<br /><br />I thought the author, Emma Donoghue, did a very good job in writing in Jack's voice.  There were inconsistencies once in awhile but they were not terribly distracting from the story.  Donoghue created a believable existence for Jack and Ma. Ma's character did a wondrous job in educating and entertaining Jack for five years.<br /><br />A visual aid that helped me is the floor plan of the Room, shown at \\"www dot roomthebook dot com/inside/\\".<br /><br />This fictional story impacted me that much more severely because it could be true, as fantastical as that sounds.  Remember the headlines and Elisabeth Fritzl, Jaycee Lee Dugard, Elizabeth Smart and Natascha Kampusch. As we all know, there really are human monsters out there.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|Friends is my favorite show of all time. I received this for Christmas and made it through the entire series within a few months. Unfortunately several discs skipped and Amazon said it was too late to return. I ended up going out and purchasing Season 2, 3, and 5 individually. Just go to Rasputins or Amazon and purchase the individual seasons USED for cheap!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I am always hesitant to watch certain documentaries because many of them mimic productions by Al Gore and Michael Moore which are not documentaries at all, just a film makers' own viewpoint.Film makers like Gore and Moore believe their audiences aren't smart enough to figure out the issue, so they resort to pandering and preaching. They overlook contrasting viewpoints and only present what they believe to be the facts. Their documentaries work on an emotional instead of a rational level and should be treated as short, bizarre films only. Documentaries by nature should be informative, innovative, and as balanced as can be. This simple formula eliminates many of these baised and unbalanced films and simply aren't worht the time. They are only viewed by people who already support that viewpoint.    So, it was with much trepidation that I followed the advice of a fellow professor and watched Food Inc. I thought it would be as poorly made as those I usually avoid. I couldn't have been more wrong. Food Inc. is a fascinating film that chronicles how food is grown, harvested, packaged, and sold in America. While it does have some graphic scenes of animal processing plants, it's goal is not to shock or disgust. It's to provide a context for the rest of the film. It is well balanced and well presented. The film maker allowed the facts to be presented so that reasonable discussion can follow. The film presents what's going wrong as well as what's going right.     A documentary should make the viewer think. This film delivers.

0618001905|5.0|This is a superlatively researched and written book. King Leopold II was a constitutional Monarch (more or less). He felt little Belgium needed colonies, and he deserved greater wealth. However, there was little available land for colonization. Most areas had beeen gobbled up by Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and The Netherlands. Still available was the vast, mostly unknown Congo Basin in the heart of Africa. So Leopold set out to acquire the land, eventually called Congo Free State. Now let us summarize some of the characters, good and bad, who played key roles in colonizing and running the state. First coming to mind is Henry Morton Stanley,born poor and a Welsh bastard. who clawed his way to power and wealth. Stanley was a cruel and ruthles task master who played a dominant role in founding the Congo Free State {a far cry from \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume!\\"}. Ivory and rubber (from a jungle vine} were the initial source of Leopold's wealth, with minerals and timber playining important later roles. Leaders of work crews often worked Congolese to death, and punishments included cutting off the hands, feet, and heads of the natives. One administrator placed human heads atop fences around his garden. Gradually these atrocities became known to outsiders. Rogen Casement, knighted and an Irish patriot was later accused of treason and hanged in London's Pentonville Prison. Emund Dene Morel, who also spent years trying to improve the lot of the Congoles, was jailed for antiwar activities. Outside pressure eventually forced Leopold to relinguish the Congo Free State, which became the Belgian Congo. Leopold, however, continued to extract further riches, that he spent building monuments and palaces--and on his tenage mistress, now ennobled. Germany invaded Belgium in WWI. Then for several decades, the Belgian Congo enjoyed relative tranquility. But the country sought and got independence. Unfortunately, the first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, was a leftist, inviting assassination approved by the Western Powers. A thug named Mobutu Sese Seko, who disliked Communism, then looted the country for a couple more decades. Beyond the scope of this book, the Hutu genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda spilled over into the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. This land of lakes, volcanoes, and mountain gorillas is one of the loveliest in Africa. I've been there twice. Some tourist dollars are now comong in, but murder, rapes, and looting once again are dominant throughout much of the country. King Leopold's ghost still hovers over the Congo!iting assassination approved by the Western Powers.

0060765488|5.0|Out of all the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, the first published is also one of the strongest of the series; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.    This is a fantasy book, about a land called Narnia, where all sorts of imaginary creatures live; mythological creatures, magical beasts, talking animals and so forth.  Four children enter it through a magical door in a wardrobe, and are soon drawn into a sort of power play between the supernatural lion Aslan, and the White Witch Jadis, who's been claiming the right to rule Narnia for many years; turning dissenters to stone.  By the numbers, it's clear that Aslan is more powerful, but the Witch is clever, and knows many tricks.  It's the type of story we've heard a number of times before, and if you don't care for allegory, you can skip to the last two paragraphs now.    In the past, I've said that Narnia is mainly more protestant than Catholic, but I may need to re-evaluate that, because the symbolism in this book is positively sacramental in nature at many points.  When mice nibble ropes off of Aslan as he lies on a stone table, there's a eucharistic image to be seen there, of eating the body of Christ on an altar (since Aslan is clearly Jesus in lion form.)  On top of this, the sacrament of confession is nearly mentioned.  After being rescued, Edmund spends time talking to Aslan in private, and afterwards, everyone is told that there's no need to \\"talk about what is past.\\"  A discussion with the savior in a private place, and the forgiveness of sins?  What else could it be, but reconciliation?    I also think it's interesting that the oldest boy, and the one who's clearly the group's leader, is named Peter.  This aspect of the bible; the primacy of Saint Peter among the apostles, is only rarely admitted outside of the Catholic Church, and their king and queenship would seem to be an allegory for both heaven, and the church.    Apart from this, the book's storyline seems to be a clear allegory of the passion and deathof Our Lord, with Aslan as Jesus, and the White Witch standing in for Satan.  Lucy and Susan are the holy women.  Still, some of the roles aren't as easy to fit in as all that.  Edmund seems to have aspects of both Saint Peter (betraying and being forgiven) and Judas (selling people out for a promised reward.)  However, neither role is really precise, which may be for the best.  It gives the story a flavor of originality, which it might not have had otherwise.    In particular, this book's main premise; of a \\"Deep Magic,\\" which even Aslan must never break is perhaps the clearest allegory of all; representing something that most modern people want to ignore; Natural Law.  Too many people want to just wander off and do their own thing, and forget that even if the law allows them to do certain things, the natural law, and the final judge are still there, and they can still run afowl of them.  Even God's will for our salvation only has so much leeway when it comes to transgressions of the natural law, and that's one thing that Lewis gets absolutely right.    However, there's also one point near the very end, where I sort of winced as well.  It's a few pages into the last chapter, when everyone is seated on thrones.  Aslan uses the words \\"Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.\\"    Not only does this prove to be false later in the series, but the phrase itself sounds dangerously like \\"once saved, always saved,\\" a belief held by many protestant denominations, but not by the Catholic Church.  Still, it would have been worse if it had got beyond just being a simple phrase.    As a book of fiction, it's entertaining, but more if you know your myths.  It's good for children, and unlike most books in the series, has a strong, frightening villain, with a major role in the plot, which only makes the rest of the story that much more exciting.  It has some weak points with respect to pure storytelling style, but not much more so than most children's books.    TheLion, the Witch and the Wardrobe may be the best fictional storybook out there for Christian children.  It's fun, exciting and packed with the sentiments of the faith.  I highly reccomend it.
B0017KXPCM|5.0|The convoluted history of this band can be found elsewhere so I will omit that to focus on what a rare and precious find this is if you can get one.  Then Play On was the masterpiece of the Peter Green led Original Mac where they really moved more toward rock while retaining their blues roots.  Green hinted at the sound of this album with brilliant tracks like \\"Albatross\\" and \\"Man of the World\\" and later \\"Green Manalishi\\" where he blended the beautifully melodic, the tortured soul and the furious guitar workout all impeccably backed by Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and the young guitar prodigy Danny Kirwan.  Incredibly, Jeremy Spencer is invisible on this record, with the dual guitars of Green and Kirwan meshing seamlessly and powerfully.  In doing so, the Mac were pioneers - one of the first Rock bands to do so with this effect of twin lead guitars that became more fashionable in bands like the Allman Brothers and Wishbone Ash to name just two.    I would argue that this original U.K. pressing is the best of any because it is true to the original intent of the band with its 14 tracks weaving the melodic (Closing My Eys, When You Say), the ravers (Showbiz Blues, Rattlesnake Shake), the bluesy (Without You) the dreamy instrumental 'Underway', workout jams (the two edited 'Madge' tracks) and the haunting (Before the Beginning).  The U.K. release had tracks left off (One Sunny Day, Without You, My Dream - all Kirwan tracks) other International ones so that single \\"Oh Well\\" could be added.  As much as I love this song, it is better heard on a compilation Mac LP because it doesn't really fit with the rest of the vibe here.  For that reason, and different cover art, this UK gem proudly stands out in my collection. Also, the Green Kirwan composing axis is more evident and as such, more rewarding IMHO.    Note:  some early North American printings had misprinted covers where Oh Well was shown but not actually on the vinyl pressing.  I know, I used to have one!    This was alsotheir last full album before a changed Peter Green left the band he created and was leader of.  The story continued with \\"Kiln House\\", a vastly different sound with moments of greatness too.  But the Mac were never to soar to the heights they attained with Then Play On again - at least until the arrival of the two Americans who took Fleetwood Mac into the Popular Rock stratosphere with \\"Rumours\\".    To close, this album is essential listening and this UK pressing remains the best of the best for one of Rock's most diverse and interesting bands!  If you can track one down, you have something very, very special indeed.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|I love this album it's amazing music, but there is a noticeable static in the background, and sound quality of the recording quality should be better.

B003IY49S4|5.0|As a newcomer to the Jazz scene, I was particularly enthused to find this excellent collection. For most of my life I have primarily been immersed in music of the \\"Common Practice Period.\\" Although I took History of Jazz during my undergraduate music degree studies, I have too long neglected this art form.     This collection of CDs represents perhaps the best, solid compilation of the most famous, original jazz recordings ranging over a wide period of jazz history. As the other reviewer mentioned the sound quality of these discs is excellent.    These discs are essentially miniaturized versions of the original LPs...with some additional bonus tracks. The front side of each disc sleeve contains the original cover art and the backside is a scaled version of the back of the LP sleeve. Unfortunately on the back, the text is almost too small to read due to the large scaling required to fit everything on the back of a CD sleeve. Each disc contains the full original album; and many of the discs contain alternate takes or versions of many of the tracks. Although I am not much interested in these alternates or recordings of rehearsals, I am sure they are of great interest to jazz enthusiasts. Hence, I believe that this collection is not only good for newcomers to jazz such as myself, but also to the well-versed jazz listeners. Of course these alternate takes can probably be found elsewhere, but it is convenient to have them side-by-side with the final album recordings.     The \\"40-page booklet\\" is in fact a 36 page listing of the discs and tracks. There are 4.5 pages of English text written by Stephane Ollivier and a French translation for the next 4.5 pages. Then, there is a page for every disc with a picture of the front cover, information about the original production date and persons involved, along with the track listing.     I had wished that the product description was a bit more specific about what exactly was in this collection before I purchased it. Thus, I am listing the discs included in this set:    No. 01: [[ASIN:B0012GMUVI Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy]]  No. 02: [[ASIN:B000002AGJ In Hi-Fi]]  No. 03: [[ASIN:B0012GMYFK The Jazz Messengers]]  No. 04: [[ASIN:B000002AH9 Lady in Satin]]  No. 05: [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]]  No. 06: [[ASIN:B000002AGN Time Out]]  No. 07: [[ASIN:B0012GMW5C First Time: Count Meets the Duke]]  No. 08: [[ASIN:B00004VSF9 Parole E Musica]]  No. 09: [[ASIN:B000P46Q18 Tijuana Moods]]  No. 10: [[ASIN:B0000CBHY5 Chet Is Back!]]  No. 11: Monk's Dream  No. 12: Sonny Meets Hawk  No. 13: Martial Solal Trio at Newport (1963)  No. 14: Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan - Two Of A Mind  No. 15: Together Again  No. 16: It's Uptown  No. 17: Nina Simone Sings the Blues (Exp)  No. 18: Piano Starts Here  No. 19: Concert By the Sea  No. 20: Head Hunters  No. 21: Best of Two Worlds  No. 22: Jaco Pastorius  No. 23: Heavy Weather  No. 24: Marsalis Standard Time, Vol. 1  No. 25: Bird: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack    Apparently the Amazon review system does not allow more than 10 links. So if you wish to see the other discs, you'll have to do the searching yourself. Obviously from the large collection above, the price is exceptional, especially on a per-disc-basis.     I highly recommend this product!
1452101248|5.0|\\"Plenty\\" is delectable enough to make committed carnivores salivate. Everything about is sumptuous. Lavish photography, a padded binding, and then there are the vegetables and the food they go into creating, food such as \\"Stuffed Portobello with melting Taleggio\\" that is so creamy and smooth and wonderfully pungent.<br /><br />I counted more than 120 recipes. They're organized into 15 chapters. Each chapter is given over to one vegetable \\"Funny Onions,\\" \\"Mushrooms,\\" or one food grouping, such as \\"Leaves Cooked and Raw\\" or Zucchini and Other Squashes.\\" To a recipe, each of Ottolenghi's creations is something special and could be served again and again as a main dish to meat eaters.<br /><br />It's my guess that at least one and probably more of the recipes will be filed with your favorites, to be prepared and served on special occasions. Any cook can prepare the dishes and the ingredients are easily found. In addition to the Taleggio my two \\"must have often\\" are \\"Soba noodles with eggplant and mango\\" and \\"Lemon and goat cheese ravioli.\\" Because of the variety of colors and textures, all the dishes are great to look at. In appearance and presentation, one of the best is \\"Surprise tatin\\" a potato tart caramelized with tomatoes and onions.<br /><br />Ottolenghi owns four crazy-popular eponymous London vegetarian take-aways and this year opened a new sit-down restaurant \\"Nobi.\\" He writes a weekly column - vegetarian - in London's \\"Guardian.\\" His feet are firmly planted on the non-meat area of the food pyramid. The recipes in the cookbook are compiled from his weekly newspaper column.<br /><br />My guess is that \\"Plenty\\" is to quickly become a classic that will find a prominent place in most cook's cooking corner. My only gripe is with the seller. I ordered the book in April and had to wait until June for it to arrive. What the heck took so long?
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|\\"The Tourist\\" is funny and entertaining movie if one does not expect too much from it.  And it is difficult not to expect too much from a movie that features two great stars: Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.  I loved the fact that the entire film was done in Italy, Venice to be exact.  Such location adds allure to this movie.  And in this film, Jolie gets to play glamorous woman, the kind that every man wants to please in every possible way.  As Depp states in one moment is she is the \\"least down to earth woman he has ever met in his entire life\\".  Jolie plays a character that dresses in latest fashion; is hypnotically beautiful and wears her jewelry and sunglasses with such grace and beauty that one cannot take their eyes off of her.<br /><br />I think that even director of this movie got mesmerized by Angelina.  They even made Depp's character look like a baffoon at times.  She is cool and composed and Depp is nervous, speaks Spanish to Italians and looks like a helpless scardy cat.<br /><br />If one does not assign too much value to this movie, it can atually be fun.
B000MGUZMA|5.0|The Arcade Fire Vinyl catalog is pressed by Merge Records. Neon Bible is exquisitely reproduced on three sides of 180gram vinyl. The fourth side has the coolest design, there is no music, instead of a blank side, Merge chose to emboss the Neon Bible logo around the album. It looks very cool. The paper inner sleeves are black with song lyrics printed on them.<br /><br />Arcade Fire's music deserves the vinyl treatment. Their music is complex and multilayered, and this comes through clearly on these excellent LP's. There are no defects anywhere on this album, the pressing is virtually perfect.<br /><br />Merge is an amazing company. The LP includes a slip of paper with a code to download 192Kps MP3's of this album. As Merge Records says, they are aware that we all listen to portable music, and they include those downloads for exactly those portable moments. A UPC code is required for the download. For some reason this LP does not have a UPC barcode. An email to Merge customer service got a response back the next day with the correct code to use. Download accomplished in minutes.<br /><br />I noticed the paper album sleeves were very tight, like a minor gluing defect. Seeing a real human responded to my first question, I replied with my concern. Later that day, I got a response back that he and the production manager had looked at the album sleeves and noticed the sleeves were tight, but that maybe I had a pair of defective sleeves. They'd be happy to send me new ones. Within a few days, a new album cover and the two inner sleeves arrived, with a nice personal note from the warehouse guy. Simple, to the point, and exactly what I needed - the sleeves, not a new album as most companies send.<br /><br />Merge Records, a company that cares about their customers and takes the time to respond personally. I can't even begin to imagine what would have happened with Warner Brothers.<br /><br />Combine a great record company and a group that makes outstanding music and this is an excellent winning album. Even at four years old, this album sounds fresh today.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003O85W44 The Suburbs [Vinyl]]]our years old, this album sounds fresh today.       [[ASIN:B003O85W44 The Suburbs [Vinyl]]]
B0021L8V0M|4.0|In this spy thriller, Angelina Jolie is a star.  She is transforming her looks from blonde to black, long hair to short hair, female to male gender.  Her attire goes from business sexy to matrix-like sexy.  As in \\"Lara Croft\\" movie this heroine is smart, determined, beautiful and she can fight, pull some serious stunts by riding on the top of the truck, or riding a motorcycle bike. Oh, and this time around, the heroine speaks Russian!<br /><br />This is an action packed movie that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  However, I found some of the scenes difficult to watch, especially the ones where Jolie's heroine gets punched around by beefy male advesaries.  Good entertainment movie that leaves ending open to \\"Salt 2\\" sequel....
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Sci-Fi as it is meant to be.<br />Truly brilliant.<br />Mirroring the prophecy, message, philosophy and moral turpitude driving through the literature of Gibson, Stephenson, and Dick-taking on the stark reality of what has passed, what is now, and that which has yet to come we're brought where few producers and Directors have dared to tread.<br />Truth.<br />This is Cyberpunk married to true Sci-Fi.<br />The irony of it being set in Johannesburg. An oppressed race...not human. Alien and we, as usual, are the oppressors.<br />Documentary style start gives way to some high tech action as we watch the inhumanity of man unfold in a political morass filled with the angst of any war on Earth built on the backs of a feared, misunderstood and hated race. Watch the propaganda machines work diligently to make the masses despise what they cannot understand and all to its own end. We fear what we do not understand and seek to break that which succeeds us. Watch this when you can, but don't go looking for a straight up sci-fi thriller.<br />This film perfectly depicts the struggle of the displaced and the evil in men's hearts.<br />Excellent film.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Thank goodness my boss was out of town today.  Jamie McGuire tells an excellent story.  I was sucked into the feelings and emotions of her characters, I spent the day feeling love, lust, anger, anguish, friendship and frustration.  The dialogue of the characters is very realistic to their age and situations. Its not often you find an indie author whose books are well written and well edited.  Jamie has is at the top of my must read authors.  If you haven't read her other book Providence get that one too!  Lightening really does strike twice.
B004WESFZW|4.0|There are few films that I actually go to the theater to see anymore and this was one. Based upon Phillip K. Dicks The Adjustment Team this adaptation was visually stunning, thrilling and thought provoking. Here we see existentialism brought to life in the myriad of choices we must make (or do we) every day. The lives of two people, the loves of two people hang in the balance and one must choose between different fates, Yes, a paradox. If it is fate how can one choose? This is the core, the essence of this film. Do we have free will? Can we choose? Does love conquer all? This film follows the life paths of David Norris and Elise Sellas. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt was palpable. I can honestly say I have not felt that kind of connection between two actors since, well, I really cannot remember. You will be rooting for these two all the way through the film. The cinematography was fantastic as we are a blur through Manhattan's various districts and beyond. While I give this film high honors I will say that it misses the mark in some areas. It truly could have pushed the envelope a little further and become something utterly fantastic, but it played it a little too safe and for that it only earned four stars, Where it sought to stimulate the intellect they held back and that disappointed because there was so much more in that capacity that could have been explored. Leave it to the viewer on that one I guess. If you are looking for a romance, you found it. If you are looking for action, you found it. If you are looking for some flash, you found it. Intellectually stimulating...that too. Definitely go and see this when you can. You will not be disappointed.<br />Namaste~
B001P06GX4|5.0|My whole family (myself, my husband, and our two girls, ages 5 and 3) all enjoyed this game.  The very first time we played it, I was worried that the kids wouldn't get it.  It sounded like a simple concept, but playing strategy seemed over their heads.  I was wrong:  our 5 year old got it the second we started, and you could see the wheels turning in her head as she planned out future moves.  Amazing!  The 3 year old just likes to pick out which piece to use next, and then we play it for her.  My husband and I both really got into the strategy as well.  Great family game!
B004QPOVG4|5.0|I saw this concert in Tulsa, OK and in Oklahoma City. It was great and it was fun returning through this video to experience it again. I thought it was well done and I enjoyed all the different views presented. There was absolutely nothing I didn't enjoy about the entire presentation. So get it, turn up the volume,(great sound)get into the music, the estatic crowd, and enjoy the best concert show of that year. They really are the masters of rockin roll.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Um, I know it's only 99 cents for this app, but all you have to do in the free version is put your phone in airplane mode before you launch the game, and NO ADS SHOW UP EVER. And it doesn't lag at all because everything's turned off...and the best part....when your mom calls and would interrupt you finally getting 3 stars on level 3-16, HER CALL WILL GO RIGHT TO VOICEMAIL! Win/win! But hey, it's only 99 cents, so, whatever.     And where is our Mine & Dine update that was due out today? Taking off a star because now I have to go to my Angry Birds Anonymous meeting tonight.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This time, Rovio PROMISED that both would be released for the same time--iOS and Android. But iPhone users already have their update...WHERE IS OURS?? It was an Amazon AppStore exclusive pre-release, so Amazon really needs to get on the ball to get the updates from Rovio as soon as Apple does. Because I need to fling some birds!
0140103112|5.0|I grew up reading this book and it changed my life as a child in a way few books did.    It is funny; even today at 36 I laugh out loud when reading it.    It is smart, and doesn't shy from portraying the protagonists with all their hangups.    It is a great gift for any kid who likes nature - or any kid you would want to like nature...  Probably kids 12 and older will benefit most from it. Some people might find some of the content objectionable - those  are probably uptight and fun-hating people. Your child is smart enough to enjoy this :-)    One of my all time favorits.
B004Z4LZ7E|1.0|Sucks.  I can't even begin about how bad it sucks.  You know what, just read all the 1-star reviews to get the idea, they're totally right.    What a waste of time...I had to drive 30 minutes to go exchange it.
B00003CWRX|1.0|The only impressive thing about this overblown and self-important film was that the director was able to get it released with easily an hour of totally disposable footage and scenes included. That must have taken some doing. Otherwise, it is totally undistinguished: hackneyed, false, and tasteless.
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Like you others, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this title on blu ray.  But I'm not sure asking Amazon to make it available for purchase can do as much good as contacting the copyright owners and/or the home video distribution rights holders.    As I understand it, the original copyright was owned by the \\"Institute for Regional Education\\" (in Santa Fe, NM?) and  \\"MGM Home Entertainment\\" had the rights for the 2002 DVD release (which wasn't bad, except when viewed on a large screen, many of the artifacts (video noise and soforth) from the standard def MPEG-2 encode became distractingly apparent).    Perhaps if we did a little research and contacted these entities directly, it might expedite the blu-ray release.  Especially for a generation that missed its original big screen theatrical release, \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", a first of its kind feature, brilliantly and painstakingly filmed by Ron Fricke, certainly should be experienced on this new format.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|I knew to expect something different when the band stated they've become extreme music now, not death metal. Still the album has death metal elements combined with various forms of extreme music.    Some of the tracks reminded me of Fear Factory's Remanufacture. Dark, powerful electronic music. When Vincent did some of his deep gregorian chants it reminded me of the sound of Peter Steele's (R.I.P.) voice when doing the same thing with Type O Negative. Overall I thought the album was quite good and very original.   I don't hear this sound coming from anyone else, but I can see similarities. Of course you can say that about any band or genre. Production was excellent and all performances were awesome. Especially Vincent's vocals who in opinion is the best singer in death metal, or should I say Extreme Music.   Hopefully the band keeps in coming either that be Morbid Angel's death metal or extreme music or both. Not for the close minded and past minded.
B003WUYOQ6|2.0|I like Gary Taubes and was introduced to his philosophy through Fat Head, then his website, and finally his interview on Dr. Oz's show.  I think he has done a remarkable job researching why we get fat.  However, I also think that he does a better job explaining what to do about it elsewhere.  If you're interested in the history of why the medical field insists on stating obesity is an issue of thermodynamics (it's not), then read this book. Otherwise, all you'll really learn from this book is that some of us are destined to be fatter than others of us.  You can attempt to regulate this by controlling your insulin levels, but you may not ever be lean.  Yes, he says that.  So even if you used to be lean and are now not so lean, cut out simple carbs, possibly even fruit if you're still gaining, and after that you still may not see your former body.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very engrossing and thought provoking.  I was so intrigued by this concept.  I fell in love with the characters, felt their pain and joy even their questioning and doubt.  I wanted to heal them make it all better and ...well ..just fix everything!  I also took time to read about the author.  Her research into post traumatic stress syndrome, particularly how it comes into play in this story.  Read and enjoy. Let your thoughts take you on a journey

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This is not only my favorite show on tv, but always my favorite book series. Pretty Little Liars is the PERFECT combo of mystery and romance, and appeals to all ages.

There best friend was murdered (or was she?!?!) of course there is going to be drama!
1400079144|3.0|Maybe I'm just over Robert Langdon, but I just didn't enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The DeVinci Code\\". In both of the earilier novels, I was perfectly willing to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the thrill ride as the story sped along. This time, I kept finding myself pulling up with a reaction of \\"Really?!\\". Perhaps it was because the broad outlines of this story are so similar to those of the earlier works. Maybe I just couldn't swallow the pseudo-science of the lost Mysteries. Regardless, I had trouble staying immersed in the story and didn't enjoy the ride nearly as much this time.<br /><br />This time Robert Langdon is drawn to Washington, DC (under false pretenses) and finds himself on a hunt for the mythical Masonic Pyramid that is supposedly burried here and which will supposedly reveal the lost Ancient Mysteries, which have been hidden to prevent their incredible power from falling into the hands of the unworthy. He faces off against a madman who seeks this power for his own purposes, as well as a CIA team that has an unknown agenda of its own. Like Brown's earlier novels, this story is compressed into a very short time span (a single night), though it stays within a single city (unlike \\"The DaVinci Code\\"). Full of symbols, codes and puzzles, this has all the elements we've come to expect of a Robert Langdon adventure.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I figured out the identity of the madman far too early, and found the attempts to distract the reader from the identity annoying. Additionally, the research into the locations used in the book was glaringly indadequate...perhaps the most jarring example for me was the description of the King Street Metro station in Alexandria, VA. The departure from reality does not play any part in the story, and merely reflects incomplete research, which just served to distract me from the action.<br /><br />The result is a thriller that is somewhat predicatable, and feels tired and worn, as if we'd read it before. I was hoping for something fresher, but this simply didn't measure up to what I was expecting. It probably is an acceptable thriller for someone new to the characters, but as a follow up to the earlier works, it just wasn't enough.for something fresher, but this simply didn't measure up to what I was expecting.

0060558121|5.0|When Shadow is getting ready to be released from prison he is eager to start his life anew. Returning to his wife, starting a new job. But fate has something else in store for him. A few days before he is allowed to leave, his wife Laura dies in a car crash while going down on Shadow's best friend Robbie, the guy who was going to provide Shadow with a new job. Alone and without any prospect on a bright future, Shadow reluctantly accepts the job of bodyguard for a mysterious guy called Mr. Wednesday. Soon enough it becomes clear that Wednesday is one of the old American Gods and is on a mission to fight the New Gods. Shadow supports his employer while travelling across America, but does not realize that his task is much bigger than he could anticipate.<br /><br />With Neil Gaiman there are no boundaries to the fantasy worlds he creates. In American Gods he elaborates on the realm he created in the famous Sandman comics and builds upon the premise that gods only exist because people keep believing in them. In what is basically a road movie, Neil slowly reveals that crazy reality with a panache that is so typical to this fantastic author. Although the pace of the story is rather slow, it brings enough fresh ideas to invigorate the reader's attention. His visual style lends itself perfectly for the more exuberant chapters like the one with the succubus-like prostitute, a chapter that in my twisted mind deserves even an actual spin-off. For readers with enough knowledge of mythology is probably is also a lot of fun to try to link the characters to known mythological figures.
1592802974|4.0|Thankfully I read this book - before checking the few negative reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />This book was a very fun read - hard-to-put-down<br /><br />The profile/interview format was very entertaining.<br /><br />This book doesn't reveal any secret sauce to being a great trader - but having the experiences of others available - helped me to adjust some of my own trading behavior.  Consider: If you were lost in a city - you could certainly (eventually) find your way - but what a boon to have a map and road signs available to you.
B001JRB16U|4.0|First Of All, Disney Did Mary Poppins A Dishoner in my opinion. They put out a Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix That Does Nothing To Enhance The Sound but add a bunch of reverb in the rear speakers and actually muddles the sound in my opinoin. Then they went and sweetened the sound effects by adding sounds that weren't in the original movie audio track. This is a no no! You don't Tamper with the original sound. All the sounds you hear must be faithful to the original film nothing added and nothing taken away. The original 2 channel audio track is the best sounding audio track on this release. Now if you still want my opinion, an earlier release of the film called the Mary Poppins Gold Classic Collection that was released in the 90's had the best audio track on it. Why disney didn't include this track I don't know but all the sounds were seperated and placed in individual speakers and no sweetening or reverb was added to the sound. Only this Gold Classic 90's Version of The release did not have 16x9 enhanced widescreen. Oh the film was presented in it's original widescreen but not enhanced to fit a widescreen TV. So as a consumer you are better off with the 40th anniversary edition. And one note, go into the audio settings and change the audio to the original 2 channel stereo and you'll get much better sound over the other choices unfortionatly. Not 5.1 surround but its better than the other 2 disney enhanced home theater mixes. Plus one more thing Disney did a dishoner with was removing the original Buena Vista Fanfare at the beginning of the movie in the 40th and 45th Anniversary Editions. Shame On you Disney. This release is not practically perfect in every way!

B000XUBFE2|1.0|A friend handed me this book and said \\"Incredible. This is required reading!\\" so of course I assumed it was going to be amazing. I like stories about WWII as well, so I thought I was in for a good read. I struggled to get to page 50, the writing was so dry and the voice of Death was annoying and distracting, not clever or witty like the author aimed for him to be. I figured the book would get better later on, so I continued reading. I got to page 350 and decided that it wasn't going to get better and I put it down. I could not understand how someone enjoyed that writing style, or why someone enjoyed such a boring story...I'd rather read Anne Frank's diary, thank you very much. This book is all hype!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|That dog of his! What a card! If for no other reason, you must read about this Druid's dog, Oberon. lol The writing was awesome, though I did find that the author tended to go on long, seemingly pointless tangents, he still keeps you interested and draws you right back in. Definitely recommended.

B004ZZITEU|5.0|I've read all the negative reviews, even before the album was released, and expected the worst only to find that this album is very good. I, like most of you reading this, are long time MA fans. I have all thier albums too. (Including Abominations of Desolation, Laibach Remixes, Love of Lava, Heretic Bonus Levels) I'm not trying to dismiss peoples opinions, but this album really is good, top to bottom.   We have all been looking forward to whatever MA has to offer since we first heard them. We all like them for our own particular reasons. We have all grown to love (Not a frosted flakes reference) what MA does, this we can ALL agree on, RIGHT?  It seems so strange to me that alot of people are taking this album so personally, like MA set out to make you mad. Listen to it or don't, these are your options. MA doesn't owe you anything, they make audio art, like it or not. I'm a huge fan of metal and other types of music. There is alot of artists to choose from. If you want MA to make the same album over and over again, just listen to your favorite MA album again, and be greatfull they made that, FOR YOU TO ENJOY!  ALSO, if your so upset by this album; wright, practice, record, and release your own album world wide, so we can all criticize and hate on it from the freedom of the internet. Having said all that, I honestly enjoy this album all the way through. Some might not, some might. That is my opinion. Have a nice day.

0688014291|5.0|I came across this book in the first year of college when I had to read it for my Introduction to Management class.    This book gives positive insight to newcomers in the business world who are searching for ways to be an outstanding manager in today's society.  It is a straightforward book which could be finished within an hour. It also allows readers to understand the responsibilities of being a manager from a different perspective.    The reason why the book is called The One Minute Manager because it reveals three secrets of being a good manager which only takes one minute to process. In addition to being realistic, the book tries to entertain the reader by telling these secrets in a story format, which makes it more interesting.    After four years, I remembered this book as the best business book I ever read in my college life. Overall, it is a quick and easy read for anyone who is looking for a game plan for their businesses and improving relationships with their employees.
B001DF68MA|2.0|I was very excited to order this seat but sadly disappointed when it arrived.  Even with the leg piece extended all the way, it was way to small for my two-year old.  My son is only 31 pounds and it said the weight limit is 40 so I assumed he would fit and he is average height (currently 35\\"), if not on the shorter side for his age.  This seat was way too small.   He refused to even try to sit in it as he was probably afraid he'd get stuck.  Since you can't really get a helmet for a child under a year and my son is 2 yrs and 3 months, I would think this seat would have an extremely short window where a child would fit.  Perhaps that explains why it is less expensive than some of the others.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game is very fun and addictive. Only issues I have are technical ones. This seems to be the only app I have installed so far that locks up my Droid X and restarts it. I even go into airline mode to make sure there's not much else going on while I play it, but in the couple of weeks I've had it, it has rebooted my phone about 8 times. Game itself is awesome though. ;o)<br /><br />Update: Since buying this, I have also purchased it for PC, PS3, and iPod Touch. I have come to realize that the Android version is the most incomplete version of this game. No Zen Garden, Puzzle Mode and Mini Games are missing. Even the iPod version has all of those things. Popcap (or EA, who owns them now I believe) needs to update the Android version! Also, still keeps restarting my phone...
B001FB55HQ|3.0|The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set the fouth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.<br /><br />A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand is Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet.<br /><br />On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfire due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it &#34;overKILL.&#34; It's a curious thing but all too true.<br /><br />Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film 3/5 Stars.<br /><br />- Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.<br />- At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a brief warm moment in a world gone mad. If the film contained more scenes like this it would have been more effective.<br />- There's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters.<br />- Bryce Dallas Howard has a very uniquely beautiful face. She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)<br />- There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Yet, strangely, none of the myriad actions sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited.<br /><br />The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. &#34;Terminator Salvation,&#34; on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as &#34;The Mummy Returns&#34; in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.<br /><br />The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.<br /><br />Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings:<br /><br />T1: A+<br />T2: A+<br />T3: B+<br />T5: C+<br />T4: Co thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise. - At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a brief warm moment in a world gone mad.

A must buy for Rock and Metal fans.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|Another liberal movie with some weak intrigue to keep you dazed. I mean come on, your not even coming up with original stories to cover up your liberal agenda anymore! Demonizing the free market and glorifying Progressivism. Ya Ya capitalism is full of greed and has done nothing for the world, and progressivism has zero to do with usurping freedom, but only feeding the starving children. The Arabian Prince philanthropist who's only thought is \\"of the children\\" cracks me up! And of course his harem of concubines is for making more children and feeding them corn OF COURSE!  WHY NOT. Lets just get as twisted as we can!     This blatant hate of America in movies, is so beat. I could write this exact review for numerous new flicks. And I think I will. Wake up people!! Freedom is NOT the enemy. And if you think it is.... You will have the blood of Patriots and Tyrants on YOUR hands.

The songs are like a soundtrack to an American college teenage movie - it is very childish. Where are the good moments....November rain - Paradise city...etc.? Only for collectors.

Although I love Faith Hill, I certainly didn't buy a Country Strong CD to hear Faith Hill...Also, without SIlver Wings can this really be the soundtrack from CountryStrong... I wish I could get my money back or at least to hear those songs from the movie which is what I just believed  was buying!!  I have to hear them on Youtube which is stupid...I tried to buy it!  WHY are the stars of this movie not getting the publicity that THEY deserve...this should not be a cd to promote other artists... sorry! I love most of them but Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester & yes, Gwyneth Paltrow deserved more that this lousy soundtrack..I am so mad right now.  I didn't really mind the song with Tim...he should have sung in the movie anyway...stupid that they didn't have him perform with his screen wife Gwyneth...    People should listen up....Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester were FANTASTIC...I enjoyed them so much... I never watch movies let alone twice, I just happen to be a huge country fan and thought I would give it a try...  Right from the beginning... the sound of Silver wINGS HAD ME SOLD!  tOO BAD IT DIDN'T GET PUT ON THE SOUDNTRACK...HUH?  DUMB!
B0042RUMH8|5.0|After the brave 'Brave' & a 4 year gap with now a new record company then what can J.Lo produce? Opener 'On The Floor' with rapping from Pitbull, breaks out with its catchy chorus & simple but worthwhile lyrics plus interpolations of 'Lambada' ('Llorando Se Fue') & has most of the world either dancing or listening to it (9); 'Good Hit' is not very good...which was a first impression but after several more listens then the engineered auto-tune or phased filter vocal effect becomes less annoying & fits in within the beat & lyrical approach \\"got that New York swagger, Miami bass, got my California Loub's on, all up in your face\\" (8); 'I'm Into You' with a pretty melody & words \\"When I look into your eyes it's over\\" that seems to somehow evoke up the spirit of Selena - Lil Wayne also nicely raps out here (9); '(What Is) Love?' with J.Lo providing an emotional delivery (7); 'Run The World' has a fairly strange start but then grows & nice the way \\"run\\" is repeated with also a change in style (8); 'Papi' is a highlight with vibrant smart sounds \\"dance for your papi\\" & fine vocals (9); 'Until It Beats No More' has a Keane / Pretenders sort of style about it with a pretty vocal \\"and there aren't no doubt about it\\" (9); 'One Love' takes us down a gear but is still good...interesting vocals chanting along behind (8); 'Invading My Mind' is full on Euro dance & improves with listens (8); 'Villain' dark & beautiful reminding of Kylie's 'Impossible Princess' with some innovative response vocals (9); 'Starting Over' anthemic anguish \\"nobody wants to be the one breaking up\\" (9); 'Hypnotico' sounds like Lady Gaga which is fine & not surprising as it's co-written by LG (8). Noticeable are (a) where is her back room wizard Cory Rooney, (b) there's a slight sameness being mainly a supercharged affair lacking some of the beauty of her previous outings & (c) where is 'Louboutins'...but notwithstanding then this is still quite possibly J.Lo's most consistent release so far.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am always looking for books that bring me back to the time as a child when I first discovered the magic of reading a story that takes y into a different world.  A book that you can't put down because you are so invested in the characters, and when you finish y ar slightly disoriented as you wake back up to the real world.  This is one of them.  I love the twist of narrating thrgh a dog's point of view.  The book made me laugh and cry and all emotional in between.  It is even complete with antagonists that you love to hate, a protagonist that you love, and a narrator that you want to have in your own life.  I truly enjoyed reading this book, and look forward to more from the same author.

B001G8WXH8|2.0|Can't believe this book has so many good reviews. This is my first Baldacci book and I am very disappointed. The plot is okay at the beginning, but toward the end it's full of holes and overly dramatic it's laughable. There is no real personality and depth of the characters, everyone is overly simplified and whatever they say or do feel so scripted. The whole book feels like a script for a cheap Hollywood action movie. What a shame. I might read another earlier work by Baldacci and I sure hope it's not as disappointing otherwise I'll be done with his books.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|i was sent blu ray when i do not believe that was selected even by mistake.  i do not have a blu ray player and now will have to go out and buy this item just so i can watch this item? i am very displeased.  i will not buy \\"used\\" again from amazon.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is an AWESOME Collector's set. If you like the Godfather's Movies as much as I do, you must purchase this complete set of all three movies.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works very well on my Droid X.  I just wish it didn't have to reload when I get interrupted by a phone call but the game itself runs smoothly.

0061537969|5.0|Never read a book so quickly in my life.  Left the world around me and got caught up in Enzo's world and his family life.  What a terrific story. Had to read it twice just to make sure I didn't miss a word.  Hopefully he will write a follow up book.
1579128149|5.0|I bought this because my son was studying the elements in sixth grade science a loved the poster version.  This book version of the element collection is full of information and great photography, its a fine coffee table style book that is a great conversation starter.
B000002MG1|5.0|I really scored with this one. I wanted Everybody Hurts, and I got more. It's a good album and the essence of R.E.M. A good buy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs well on Acer Iconia A500, not able purchase for the Iconia in the android market but able to purchase and download from Amazon. Once file downloaded installed from download location.     Fun game wish it was longer and had difficulty settings. Once you have finished the game there is the option for quick games which extends the fun factor.
B000002OMN|5.0|i don't care for the rest of the album but the song, \\"I'd do anything for love.\\" is what I wanted. and it's better than I ever imagined. I am very happy with my buy.

B000002GVO|5.0|I wanted hotel california and I got it. It's got other surprises sound wise, and deep lyrics. Good music group.
0767817664|4.0|I saw the trailer for the unnecessary remake of the classic mid-1980's flick and I am not impressed. I'm not putting it down just because it's a remake; a remake could be good, though I cannot really name one off the top of my head. The trailer just looked boring and Colin Farrell as Jerry Dandridge, the head-vampire, doesn't look the part. I'll give it a rental, but have no interest in seeing it in the theatre.    I saw this original there and got it on DVD for just $2 at a yard sale recently. The DVD's best 'special feature' is simply the movie, as there is nothing else. It has widescreen on one side and full-screen on the other, so that's good for those who have a preference. As well, this has subtitles in the most languages that I have on any DVD on I own. However, watching it with the English subtitles, it seemed that there were many points were there were no words for quite a while.    When Dandridge became the bat, I liked that a lot and, especially when he was destroyed, I thought it was awesome. It had a lot of old, practical effects and makeup that were really good for the time. I'll pick puppetry and classic effects over computerized, fake stuff any day. The remake will most-surely be filled with expensive CGI and that will make it lose appeal for me. However, I love magic and to have the Peter Vincent character be a stage magician instead of a horror-movie host is an interesting idea. Will Mr. Vincent use illusion to trick the vampire into his demise? I think that idea could be used well.    However, Mr. Vincent will not be played by and elderly man, so I think that won't be as interesting. Also, this will be in an over-populated place (Los Angeles, I believe) and that is not preferred. In the original, it took place in 'Anytown, USA'. That gave it a better atmosphere, thinking that it could happen in any common neighbourhood much like the one you're probably in. I hear that Chris Sarandon, who played Dandridge in the original, is supposed to have a cameo in the new flick and that would be cool (yet, most assuredly, it will be too small a part). I hope that the FRIGHT NIGHT theme from J. Geils Band plays a lil' bit somewhere, too...perhaps on a radio station in someone's car? Lastly, concerning the remake, I'm hoping that they re-release the original and the sequel with more features. Specifically FN2 as its cost is ridiculous.    Okay, so back to this flick: it's great.    I don't fully understand the dude who lived with Dandridge. He walked around in the daylight, obviously wasn't human because he was eventually shot multiple times and lived, but a wooden stake through his heart did kill him. His demise was more like a zombie's -- but dont they usually expire when they are shot in the head? When you saw Dandridge's coffin being discovered in the basement, I just noticed that there were two coffin's there. One contained Jerry and the other was open and, I assume, was for the roommate. So...what was that guy? A werewolf in human form? I imagine...and the bullets that Peter Vincent fired weren't silver bullets? Yet can a werewolf be killed with a stake? Whatever...it was still a cool death when he melted into goo and sand.     I was probably more scared as a kid when I watched this; now, it still has some spooky moments but I had 'fun' with it. There's a fair amount of blood, but it's the teeth of the ghouls...noises and sound effects...and eerie locations that add the most to it. It was a bit emotional, too, especially when 'Evil' is dying from being impaled in wolf-form by Peter Vincent and is in the process of converting back to a human. The half wolf/half human and then fully human 'Evil' reaching out to Vincent was something. Roddy McDowall appears honestly affected by this and must feel sad as well as simultaneously relieved that the monster didn't get him. Remember that everything he's seeing was for real and vampire movies were coming to life before his very eyes. He was a fine actor and will always be the genuine vampire killer.
0760703329|5.0|I wanted a book that had most or all of his plays, and poems in one book. I didn't want someone to help me figure out what he is saying, so no helpful author in intro for me. This book gives me exactly what I want. Only some of the letters are missing, as if the typing of the book has been on a typewriter and the ink had been running low. It's not every other word it's about every other page or so. It's good gives character, and a good feel for the book. It's a book where one reads the table of contents and begins to read from the title. I am on Romeo and Juliet. It's a read from cover to cover the layout is more adventurous than that, but one could read it cover to cover. It looks so fancy and wonderful. I am very intrigued with this book. But inside is what I wanted. And it's perfect for me one who is just discovering Shakespeare.
B004XZ99LO|1.0|I bought this movie because I love Cirque du Soleil and I just got a new 3D TV.  Aside from some bright colors this seems completely unrelated to the Cirque du Soleil stage show.  It's set underwater, in the woods, etc.  It is incredibly boring.  The 3D effects are not very good.  I think we got through at least half of it fast forwarding waiting for something good (which never came).  It's so bad I'm just going to throw it out.
B000002GYW|5.0|The album isn't what I wanted. I wanted the song desperado. Love that song. I have heard the album and it's good. They are so surprizing in their music. One really has to hear it to believe it. They are an American band that isn't afraid to try on different sounds, breaking in a culture different from their own. It's a soild ablum, and really fun to listen to. If your into surprises, and philosophy this album is for you. They go deep lyrically, and mix in a shocking, fun vibe of sound.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|I already have the blu-ray and I enjoyed it so much that I had to get the CD/DVD package, just to get the CD.       To my ears, in comparison to the DVD, the CD mix mainly amplifies and highlights Brandon Flowers' wonderful vocals.  The CD has some different sounding instruments and sound effects too.   The CD is mixed just different enough from the video to stand on it own merits.    As to the video, I wholeheartedly agree with all the other reviewers who rave on how great this concert is.   Being \\"live\\" really elevates this concert to another level.  The venue location, the production values and the song list are excellent.  The vocals, the musicians, and the fan enthusiasm really make this concert shine.    Specifically, Brandon Flowers really out-performs himself, to the point of exhaustion.  In addition, I must point out that Mr. Flowers is so polite and well-mannered.
B004H2ZFPW|3.0|I felt this album is a try at getting back at what she knows, but not in original state. She is more product like in the sound. She is unique as a people go. Only in this album it's nothing like her others. It's more sassy, and in your face. It's not that deep on any level. Still I love Avril and want to hear more which is why this album is in my life.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|\\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". That seems to have been the mentality of director Todd Phillips on set. The sequel for the surprise 2009 smash hit \\"The Hangover\\" was inevitable. How Phillips would tackle such a sequel, wasn't quite as clear. \\"The Hangover Part II\\" uses the same formula that brought the first film such success. The EXACT same formula. Here's the opening: It's wedding day, the bride is anxious, and an exasperated, beleaguered Bradley Cooper sputters from his cell phone: \\"We did it again\\". OOPS! This movie suffers from the \\"Sex and the City 2\\" conundrum, in which the screenwriters basically say, \\"Let's make the same exact movie.... somewhere else\\".    Part II takes place in Bangkok, as opposed to Las Vegas. Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married there, and he wants no issues, nothing that could even possibly recreate the horrifying events from the first \\"Hangover\\". All he wants is a \\"bachelor brunch\\" at ihop, but is eventually coerced into having just one beer down at the beach with the guys. Cue the timelapse, cut to the morning after, then to the emptying of the pockets, then to the ensuing hijinks. The biggest problem with \\"The Hangover Part II\\" is its inherent predictability. By following the same cookie-cutter formula, we as the audience aren't shocked by anything, no matter how much they try to raise the stakes (and they try constantly).    Everything is bigger, if not necessarily better, in \\"The Hangover Part II\\". Someone gets shot at one point, kidnappings and gun shootings are commonplace, drug deals, monkeys, transvestites, riots in the streets. They even have Stu strumming a guitar, singing a song about their absurd misfortunes, much like in the first Hangover! The first Hangover's charm was the insane but legitimate spontaneity of it all. We genuinely cared about what happened, how it happened, and where their friend Doug was. In this one, it's just distracting, and frankly embarrassing watching them go through the motions of the first film in a new city, as Ed Helms tries to contort his facial reactions in new, unique ways.    It probably sounds like I hate this movie, but that's not the case. I found myself laughing throughout, so it's definitely an effective film; the guy next to me certainly thought it was \\"way better\\" than the first one. \\"The Hangover Part II\\" will probably be very successful in the box office, but it will have no lasting imprint like the first one. Unfortunately, the project was doomed from the start; by following the same formula, they were setting themselves up for failure. I know I keep harping on the same point, but it's one that defines the whole movie. I truly would have liked to have seen these characters in a different scenario, but not the same scenario somewhere else! That's just absurd! \\"I can't believe this is happening again!\\" screams Stu at the top of his lungs. Neither can I Stu, neither can I.
B000002MY3|5.0|I heard this CD when I was a kid, and I wanted it for myself as an adult. It's hard to find, and once found I am very happy with it. Anyone can relate to it, but if your a girl who feels like their the Jesus Christ kid in life. This album is for you. She'll bring you right back down to earth, and let you know your not the only one. Ahhh balance and perfection.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw Pink Floyd in person back in 1988 and this DVD, which is wonderfully produced, brought back those memories when I watched it. Having rented it first on Netflix, the DVD was so good that I first bought the CD and then the DVD as both are a must for any Pink Floyd fan.<br /><br />The sound quality is great and plenty attention is placed on all participating musicians, especially on Gilmore when he plays his masterful leads.<br /><br />I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele. Her voice the first time I heard it...I had been so amazed. She is so good. What I like about this album is the consistancy in it. It's got a story within a story from how the tracks are running down the line. To every song on this album has such a feast for the senses. Her voice to the melody, and down into the instrumental sound. I can't get enough of her, and if you like soul, blues, r & b-Adele is seriously for you. She's got it made I can't wait until I get the next album.
B004VFYOA2|3.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD when I saw it for release. Well i got it today and am really sad to see how bad the video is. In some cases it looks like a bootleg VHS. It's still good to see this version of the band in a live setting but just wish the image was better. The audio sounds great though, David is in top form and the band is perfect as always. For the price it is worth it but I doubt it will get repeated viewings. Get the version with both the CD and DVD and I am sure you will enjoy listening many times.
0439023483|4.0|Like many of the reviews posted online, I found this to be a very exciting, engaging book - enough that I finished it in two days, staying up late both nights just wanting to see where the story took me.  But first, I just want to say that I really don't like present tense for fiction.  That is the main reason why this will not be getting five stars from me.  I don't mind first person at all, but present tense just annoys the heck out of me.  But yes, back to the book!<br /><br />The concept is nothing new at all(Battle Royale, The Long Walk, etc), but the author manages to put a new spin on it, making it seem fresh and exciting by putting it in a futuristic world hundreds of years in the future, adding in science fiction elements that are new for this limited genre, and making the characters come to life.  I wish it would have been more futuristic.  The book was very readable and kept me involved from the first few pages, but some of the characters seemed a little lacking to me, especially Peeta.  I didn't understand his actions at all, or his motivations.  Katniss is your typical girl in a way, but she was developed in a stronger sense.  Overall, though, there was one character I wanted to know more about - Rue.  Even though she dies halfway through, I wish the main character would have been her instead of Katniss.<br /><br />The world building seems very incomplete, but there is a second book for that reason, which I hope to read soon (plenty of other stuff I have to read first, though).  I also wish a map would have included, but that's just my opinion.  Anyway, the reason this book gets four stars from me is the way it keeps you involved and keeps the reader tied to it.  At the end of the day, I want to be engaged and want to keep reading, and this book did just that, even if it was mindless entertainment.  If I wanted to learn I would actually read my schoolwork.
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Some one actually said they didn't like this! Unbelievable! One of the greatest albums of the year. My favorite among Brad Mehldau Albums. Joshua Redman fits perfectly with this album and it tells a well rounded story throughout all the songs. Please listen to the entire album again if you think otherwise.
B004Y03LQ2|3.0|...I can't imagine many people lining up to buy this. Seeing how many of Maiden's fans complained about last year's tour setlist being heavy on their 21st century material - and the fact that a lot of casual fans probably won't recognize many of the songs here - I guess this one's aiming to attract the fans in the middle? Regardless, it's nice to see a companion piece to 2008's \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\" retrospective, though why did they suddenly become more generous this time out? (This one's got a second disc, and has at least 8 or 9 more songs than the other one).    The nice thing is that between this and \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\", the more casual of Maiden fans now have a deeper and more satisfying retrospective than 2002's single-disc \\"Edward the Great\\" (remember that?).
B00127RAJY|5.0|All I have to say is..you will sweat! Great purchase...I am a size 4, use to be a size 2 until I had my baby 8 months ago. I worked out, lifed weights up until the actual day I went into labor and I purchased th3 level 3 and I was sweating with in 10 minutes. As a mom I find it hard to go to the gym with my baby being so young, so I needed something I can do while he sleeps. This is a great buy, would highly recommend it!
B0017R5TUQ|5.0|\\"Carved in stone\\" is the 18th studio album by the German heavy/power metal band \\"Rage\\" originally released in 2008. \\"Carved in stone\\" is the first album to feature Andre Hilgers (ex \\"Silent Force\\") behind the drum kit, alongside founder bassist/vocalist Peavy Wagner and long serving guitarist Victor Smolski.  (Andre had collaborated with Victor on the \\"Nuclear Blast\\" anniversary album, 2007)<br /><br />The album is a considerable departure from its predecessor, the orchestral/symphonic \\"Speak of the dead\\". \\"Carved in stone\\" is \\"Rage\\" going back to their basic guitar/bass/drum sound of the mid 90s. Still with such an accomplished songwriter as Wagner, a guitar virtuoso and master composer as Victor and a young heavy hitter drummer you have every reason to hold high expectations for \\"Carved in Stone\\". Indeed the symphonic element is completely diminished on \\"Carved...\\" with the exception of the epic track \\"Lord of the flies\\" being a symphonic metal opus. From there onwards one gets a list of heavy/melodic highlights in \\"Gentle murder\\", \\"Lost in the void\\", \\"Drop dead\\" and \\"Long hard road\\".<br /><br />Regarding the lyrical concept,, the album deals directly with the dark, mystical and sci-fi subject of the previous albums only this time going a bit further integrating war and heroism to their list of topics. Overall \\"Rage\\" managed to deliver yet another memorable studio album full of substance once again balancing perfectly heaviness, speed and melody.
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|Is there an update on the way anytime soon? Loved the game but refuse to reinstall until it stops eating up so much ram that my phone crashes for minutes at a time.i hope you are reading these reviews. Most love it, but it needs work.
B003UESJEW|2.0|Here is a junky, TV-style version of the new millenium recession.  It has all the hypocrisy and schmaltzy platitudes of a Disney Newseum, person-of-week report.  There is Tommy Lee Jones as a saintly executive who is canned but starts his own business and saves all his old cronies from the poor house.  (Happens all the time!)  There is laid-off hotshot Ben Affleck, whose family loves him so much they even like living with the in-laws.  (Downsizing is great for family values!)  There is a really disturbing scene where Affleck chooses to work for his brother-in-law, Kevin Costner, instead of robbing a bank.  (Pathetic!)  There is one convincing character who manages to make it clear that suicide really is painless, but, in the end, it is just more pandering crap from the writer-director who gave us THE WEST WING.
B0000033K2|5.0|Coltrane's entire Atlantic catalogue - what more can you want? This is a cornerstone for everyone interested in modern jazz, and essential for the understanding of the development och Coltrane's music up to 1960. This 7-cd box is exemplary in presentation and in getting to understand the music and the man behind it. One wish that there is another box like this for his later Impulse recordings, from start to finish, and not just the quartet recordings that Impulse has released. The pace with which the music develops is even more rapid on the later recordings. But the Atlantic years is a superb release.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting.  I couldn't put it down.  I read all three (Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mocking Jay) back-to-back-to-back.  Go ahead and buy it.  You will not be disappointed.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Being a longtime Morbid Angel fan, and seeing the band several times with both lineups over the years (as well as Jared from Hate Eternal doing vocals RIP) I have always had a huge amount of respect musically and personally for Trey; hell, i've even played with the Sailor Scouts Quake clan for a while..)  I have enjoyed seeing the band evolve from each album and keeping things fresh, but undeniably Morbid Angel.  I always liked Steve Tucker and thought he did a great job filling a tough position, but when he left and Vincent stepped back in, I had high hopes like many.  Live they once again ravaged through a classic set of all old Morbid Angel and with good energy.  Well somewhere along the line, things went bad... very bad.  I know from chatting with Trey that he is into a lot of non-metal music, and I respect that, as I am as well, however what he put out here is such a diversion, such a step back,  I don't even know how they can slap the Morbid Angel name on it. I would have never expected Trey to let us down like this.  We only get about 4 real death metal songs on the thing, and really the only good one is Blades for Baal.  The rest of the album is not daring, new, innovative or exciting like they claim.. it's just AWFUL. Bad and dated electronic beats and horrendous lyrics make this album seem like a bad joke.  I maybe would have accepted this as some sort of side project or even an EP.. but 8 years in the making, return album?  Shocked at first.. then mad.. now I just think it's kind of funny...is what it is, but I refuse to buy into this.  I refuse to support this and it's a shame that the band is calling out their fans that have negative reactions to to this album, saying the real fans will understand this.. well.. I guess i'm not a real fan anymore, but I will never stop listening to A-H.
B003VBVQKS|4.0|This was a commercial failure when it was released in 1975, and it was not considered a \\"real\\" DP record by many fans. Blackmore was gone, and Bolin had a completely different style; they were night and day. Coverdale and Hughes had drawn the band away from their heavy, blues driven roots and towards funk and R&B. But this two-CD re-release is a true revelation. The star of the show is a jam between Bolin and drummer Ian Paice. It's a furious throw-down that shows how capable Bolin really was. It's unfortunate that this jam never evolved into a song and never gave Bolin the attention he deserved. Truth be told, he was probably the wrong choice to replace Blackmore, but 36 years on, this record stands up well. Trouble is that, as Jon Lord has stated, it really doesn't fit into the DP catalog very well. That doesn't make it a bad record; hardly ; it just makes it an odd DP direction. But if you love DP as I do, you need to own this remastered, expanded version with Kevin Shirley's remixes and two previously unreleased tracks that show Bolin at his best. It's not typical Purple, but it's damned good and it shows who Bolin could have been under different circumstances.
B004IK8Q86|3.0|Did I read the same book as other reviewers here? I was not so moved by this story or its characters. I must say Elliott Templeton, fop, elitist, esthete, snob with a good heart, dominated much of the book and was an interesting study of an out-of-step super rich man who was loyal to his sister and niece and friends. Ultimately, Elliott's rather puerile values and existence find some degree of redemption. But Larry's story, his spiritual quest, his drifting life, and his long pursuit of meaning became a long winded and tedious trip for me. I kept thinking too about Larry's ability to sustain himself. He somehow had enough money to ramble through the world without many worldly concerns. His smile and unflappable nature took him through every situation and relationship.<br />I don't know. He didn't seem real. The book seemed creaky and dated and the writing itself somewhat unreal and stilted. I did like Maugham using himself as a character and interacting with everyone else. I also liked how Maugham achieved the feel of the depression hitting suddenly, ending an incredible American decade of unbridled optimism. But in no way was this book a life changer for me. It was interesting in places, tedious in others. So this is a mixed review of what's considered a classic.
B0000931LJ|5.0|This is a very nice album, both the content and the sound quality of the recording. The album cover art is great. All in all this is an excellent product.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|So, I was strolling around Blockbuster's looking for a good movie, something light, romantic....maybe even a comedy thrown in somewhere. Well, I am a movie hound, and have seen pretty much all the great movies out and decided to settle on \\"Love & Other drugs.\\" Unfortunately, this movie has been made over and over again in different ways and different actors... HINT&lt; HINT, \\"Love Story, Sweet November, Dying Young,  and last but not least...Autumn in New York.\\"  LOVE STORY was one of the first, that I can recall, which was sweet and endearing... as for my own opinion, Love and other drugs is simply about the same typical guy character, who is a free-lovin, penial tossing womanizer,--who meets a very free-spirited, artiste, beautiful girl.... who.... is sick!<br /><br />Sad as it is-Parkinson's is probably the own real moments in this non-weeper of a movie-<br /><br />NOTE: Although the illness was a bit of twist on  diseases ending in [Coma} If you want to see another movie about a charming man,  who is a free-lovin, penial tossing womanizer and a very free-spirited, artiste, beautiful girl, watch \\"AUTUMN in New York, Sweet November and Dying Young.<br /><br />Save your money and just rent it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I like zombie stuff and I like 'tower defense' games. This has a little of both. The theme is whimsical and fun,  graphics are great, and the length of each level is perfect for casual gaming. Overall a very fun little game. 5 stars!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game will randomly delete your saved game file so you have to start over from the start. Worst bug ive ever seen in a game. Not acceptable!!!! Otherwise great game. Adventure mode could be longer.
0634022296|4.0|If you play guitar (or ukulele as I do) and know the songs, you will love this book. It has every song the Beatles have done, and it includes a discography at the end so you can see what album, LP or B-side the song is from. One of the things I HATED about my previous Beatles songbook is that it was not comprehensive. And some of my favorite Beatles songs are lesser known. Very annoying like having a lame mini-dictionary. What good is that when the words you want to look up are probably too trivial for a mini-version?<br /><br />It's a compact book of reasonable dimensions, so it travels well.  True, a spiral binding would make it more usable (stay open), but a binder clip or paperweight can effectively keep the book open.<br /><br />You definitely need to know the songs, though, because there are no \\"notes\\" like piano sheet music. But it does show you all the guitar chords you'll need to know for the song, and then the chord names appear above the lyrics where the chord changes take place. I play ukulele and know the chords by name, so this works just fine.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I was always resistant to watching BSG due to the timeline of Scifi network that it came out during.(Around the time RDA left SG-1) but my boyfriend persuaded me to watch it and it operates on a whole other tier of awesome. Really amazingly well done tv show. I want more shows to be like this one.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Most disapointing album ever. Terrible techno infused songs, and even the death metal tracks sound like domination d-sides. Avoid at all costs if you ever liked morbid angel in the past. If you love new Marilyn manson then go buy this right now.
B0049VQZUA|2.0|While I can't say the quaility of the streaming sucked I can say I really didn't care for the content.  I tried to watch this series because I was told how great it was.  I found it to be just your typical zombie junk and I didn't care for it at all.
B001AQT0OU|5.0|Before there was Peter Greenaway.   Before there were the Coen Brothers, there was Stanley Kubrick, the icy titan of cool cinema.    His heartless, pitiless, inhuman view of humanity was as perfectly matched to his material here as were the Coens with Cormac McCarthy.   And what came out in both cases: masterpieces.    Yes: he drove his crew to insanity in his search for perfection (I've heard the stories from the men themselves).   But perfection is on display here: perfection in the assemblage of a rogue's gallery of tableaux vivantes illustrating the folly of man.       Is it heart warming?  Hardly.   Is it boring?   Depends on you.   Are you boring?   Do you enjoy experiencing great paintings at, say, The Louvre?   How would an afternoon at a Palladian Villa in the Veneto strike you?   Or would you prefer playing Tron, the video game?  (Actually, there might be an overlap, but you get the point).      Was Ryan O'Neal a good actor?    Watch \\"Paper Moon\\" and you'll have to say he wasn't half bad.   Here, it doesn't matter.   Kubrick doesn't want actors.   He wants flesh he can xray.    And he gets it.  But these are X-rays by candlelight.    And that's magic.        The soundtrack was assembled by James Dean's mentor, Leonard Rosenman.   The two pieces everyone wants to find are the Sarabande by Handel and a Piano Trio by Schubert (I think, perhaps, #1).    You can get a fabulous DVD of that piece being played by the Beaux Arts Trio:  highly recommended.
B000TGJ8F8|2.0|Lee Tamahori's Next is one of those films that leaves one scratching one's head wondering what the point of the film was. If we had the ability to see into the future what would we do with that ability? Tamahori spends a brief ninety six minutes trying to answer this question.    Las Vegas showroom magician Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) has a secret which torments him: he can see two minutes into the future. Sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power, he lies low under an assumed name in Vegas, performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling \\"winnings.\\" But when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, government agent Callie Ferris Julianne Moore) must use all her skills to capture Cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm. Along for the ride is potential love interest and terrorist bait Liz Cooper (Jessica Biel).    This movie has a premise that would be incredibly interesting if explored more deftly. Instead what we get is a nonsensical chase movie that feels cobbled together. The screenplay by Gary Goldman is based on the Phillip K. Dick short story \\"The Golden Man.\\" The performances by Cage and Moore seem wooden and the dialogue feels turgid and contrived. As for the terrorist group's plotting: I can honestly say I have no clue who these people are or what they are trying to accomplish. The film simply provides a sketch of an idea and pits everyone against each other. There is plenty of action but none of it is really convincing. If the movie is anything it is loud.     The HD DVD that I viewed presented an adequate transfer of the film. David Tattersall's photography seems overly heavy and saturated at times. The sound mix is quite good though with clear separation between the channels in the HD True mode. The disc features several featurettes that to Paramount's credit are all in HD and a trailer.    If you must see this one itis definitely a rental. The most helpful thing I could say after seeing it was \\"Next.\\"
B004WCTLNY|1.0|This movie bored me in the first 10' which is hard to do because I love this genre of movie. The references to God and angels as the bureau was ridiculous (don't the writers know any of the precepts of the Judeo-Christian \\"God\\" ?). I wouldn't pay good money to watch this movie luckily I saw I it on the airplane.

0425242099|3.0|When I read a book and I LOVE it, I don't eat, sleep or do anything else but read. Case in point: Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, Richelle Mead.<br /><br />I feel asleep halfway- 3/4 way through this book!<br /><br />Now, I get the whole tension and chemistry building between Hawke and Sienna but it wasn't something that made me go next page, next page.I don't know why.<br /><br />It's been two days and I still haven't finished it. I have finished Larissa Ione's Eternal Rider though (great story!)<br /><br />Anyway, as it stands, this book is a 3 1/2.  I will come back and give it a higher grade if after I finish the book, it deserves such a grade.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just when I thought there couldn't be a better time-waster than Angry Birds, along comes Plants v. Zombies.  It's both fun and funny, and offers an amazing number of creative game options.  You are rewarded with a new \\"plant\\" after almost every round, which makes you want to keep playing and playing.  To spice things up a bit, the games has mini-games that appear every few rounds that require entirely different tactics.<br /><br />I got in on this on launch day when it was free, and while I don't usually review apps, I thought the developers deserved a positive review for releasing this at no cost and then at a reduced cost.  I would gladly have paid five dollars for the game, but even at full price it sells for less.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|This is a review for the Blu-Ray version of Evangelion 1.11 You Are Not Alone.  First off there is very little I can say that hasn't already been said.  Be that as it may I would offer a few cents of my own.    First the image quality looks awesome on my 1080P LCD tv.  Evangelion has never looked better.  Second while I only have a 2.1 sound system, the 6.1 HD audio track sounds impressive.  I am especially impressed at the work done on the US english dub.  The US audio engineer didn't lay the english voice track on top of the sound but blended all sound tracks together.  The end result is a sound track resembling a summer action block buster theatric release.  While the japanese audio emphasizes the dialog track over all other sounds as usual.    On the other hand this disc appears to be lacking in extras considering the storage capacity of a blu-ray disc.  The slick container and information booklet don't quite makeup for the lack of on disc extras.    As for the story itself, I consider this version to be an alternate universe.  While it appears to be the first six tv episodes, with better graphics, there are subtle differences from the very beginning.  Keep this in mind and you most likely won't have a fit.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I was pretty scared to buy these rattles because there were no review on it about how good it rattles. But i decided to try it and put it on my 6 week old wrist.

1851775722|3.0|I loved the photo's. The quality is exquisite. The detail offered in the commentary regarding background on the actual articles was a very nice surprise, and really made me feel connected to the pieces. However, I longed to see full shots of the articles themselves, and not just the close-ups of sleeves, trims, and selected tailoring. That was the only thing missing. The colors in the shots and the detail in the drawings certainly were worth the cost of the book. I would recommend it highly. I would also love to see a follow-up edition showing 360 degree photos of the articles themselves(and others)to complete the experience. Although, I know that would make for a very large, expensive volume. I would buy it. I did have to wait over 8 weeks for my book to arrive, but that is another review altogether.[[ASIN:1851775722 Nineteenth Century Fashion in Detail]]

014241543X|3.0|Mediocre, and a tad unrealistic. I didn't like Mia's character much, if at all. Although her relationship with music is explored beautifully, her life in all other areas is completely lackluster. Her relationships with her parents, brother, and boyfriend are sickly-sweet, and not a lot of teenagers would be able to relate.     I did like the topic of the book, which was quite imaginative. However, I think it could've been explored much more deeply.
0061245097|5.0|This was my most favorite book - walking into the wedding ceremony was hilarious, I don't think anything prepared me for that and I cracked up every time I read it and like all my favorite books I read it a lot!
0670022411|5.0|I could not put this book down.  And it is an epic book - covering centuries of details and history of Vampires, Witches and Daemons.  All trying to live with humans.  For me, a book that puts a new twist on the old myths about vampires and witches with new \\"facts\\" and a smart storyline, makes this one of the best books I've read in years.  I love that the characters are scientists, historians, brilliant characters in their own right, and then add the lore of the supernatural to everything.  It is a fresh storyline - not one I have ever seen before and that kept me intrigued from the first page.  It is told with such mastery that you begin to believe, THIS is the factual story of vampires and witches.  And everything else you have read was a myth made up by humans.  From the countryside of France, to the halls of Oxford in deep description,  I just loved this book and cannot wait for another from this author.  (If you are an avid reader, there is nothing \\"long\\" or \\"slow\\" about this book.  It's a total pageturner.)
B000JML7EC|5.0|I have just finished reading my first Kindle Android App classic, Treasure Island. It was a joy! I had first read the book at age nine without the least knowledge of seafaring or sailing terminology, and with no ear for the lilt of nineteenth century English narrative style or dialogue. From an adult reader's perspective, and with a familiarity with Victorian wordplay and pronunciation, the story sailed along like a schooner on the trade-winds. If you have a talent for a spectrum of British accents and dialects, or the ability to act, read this book aloud to your kids. It is rather gory in places so it is probably not recommended for very small children, but it will be loads of fun for most young adventure-seekers. The story has not lost any of its charm or suspense in over 100 years. As a fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, I noticed a thousand details in the book that had made their way fully intact from Robert Louis Stevenson's nineteenth century imagination into those recent and popular films. Thank you for the free download. I'm hoping to find Stevenson's Kidnapped among the free classics, as well.

1400052173|5.0|I read this book shortly after graduating with an undergrad degree in biology. I had seen black and white photos of Henrietta Lacks in different textbooks but no one ever mentioned she was an African American woman and the story behind the cells. We discussed hela cells and their immortality as if they came from no one. But back to the book. Rebecca Skloot has done an amazing jobs of presenting the scientific facts and showing the human side to this story.   Henrietta Lacks may be chuckling in her grave because apparantly these cells have contaminated other cell lines due to the rapid rate at which they divide. Anyhow, this is a great read for anyone and a must read for anyone studying cell biology.
0062060554|5.0|Christine wakes up every morning believing she is in her mid 20's and is shocked to see a middle aged woman when she looks in the mirror.  Her husband, Ben explains that she was in an accident and cannot make new memories.  Every day he must tell her who she is,  about their lives as husband and wife and answer all her questions again.  Any knowledge that she gains on a daily basis is lost once she goes to sleep.<br /><br />Today, after Ben leaves for work she receives a call from Dr. Nash, of whom she has no memory.  He has been treating her and when they have an appointment he calls to remind her and tells her where she can find the notes that she has written to confirm his role in her life.  Christine has been seeing Dr. Nash without Ben's knowledge and when they meet today, he hands her a journal that she has been keeping over the past few weeks.  He would call her every day to tell her where the journal is hidden so that she could continue to write in it and use it to remember past events.<br /><br />When the reader starts Part 2, we are reading Christine's journal and it is too detailed and well written for it to be believable that it was written while she was trying to keep it hidden from Ben. (\\"I am sitting here, in this unfamiliar bed, writing my story dressed in a silk nightie that the man downstairs ----- who tells me that he is my husband, that he is called Ben ---- apparently bought for me for my forty-sixth birthday.\\")  The entire journal is as descriptive as this, yet she is supposed to be writing it hurriedly and secretly while Ben is somewhere else in the house.  This is the novels ONLY flaw.<br /><br />This is an entertaining, gripping, thought provoking thriller and once read it is easy to understand why Ridley Scott bought the movie rights before the book was published.  It is hard to believe that this is the author's first novel, the plot and characters are believable, the writing is confident and straightforward.<br /><br />Many others have already left detailed plot line reviews and I would just be repeating their excellent reviews were I to continue.  While the plot is different from most of the thrillers out there, it would be unreasonable to say that categorize this book simply as a mystery.  I think that readers of both genres will find that this book holds their interest.<br /><br />WRITING:  5  stars<br />STORY:  3 1/4  starseviews and I would just be repeating their excellent reviews were I to continue.

B004WJRJUE|5.0|I first discovered Twisted Sister with 1983's You Can't Stop Rock & Roll when I was 13, and they quickly became one of my favorite bands. Shortly after I heard their debut- the original Secret Records version- and was blown away! Like most TS fans, I was dissapointed by the 1985 re-mix (and new track \\"I'll never grow up now\\")which took off a lot of the rough edges. In fact, i never even bothered to buy it on cd- ever! I was thinking about finaly biting the bullet recently, when to my amazment I read about this new release! And I was not dissapointed at all this time! While it may not have the rawness of the original- it still rocks hard. TS may get lumped in with other pop metal bands, but they were a whole different breed. They don't write constantly about girls & partying- and there is nothing poppy about this album. Heavy riffs drive every song, from the brutal \\"Destroyer\\", the speed metal track \\"Tear it Loose\\" and the slow then slamming \\"Run for your Life\\" Definitly recommended !    As for the extra's- this is actualy the first time I heard the Ruff Cuts demo. Very cool- but i still prefer the UTB versions. And the Reading concert was a real treat. The camera angles may be limited, but in the liner notes they explain that they didn't plan to originaly film the entire show- so you have to be happy with this. Dee shows that he was as good of a front man as any other 80's rock band. If you're a fan of TS, this edition is an absolute must!!
0061251321|5.0|what really spoke to me was the reality that you had to find the reason you were doing what you were doing. This resonated with me as core reason why i had chosen my line of work way back before i really knew why. back then, it was what interested me, it was what i had passion for. years later, it's so true that you HAVE to know why you're doing what you're doing. who you're serving, and that you can not lead if you are not serving.  If you watch the \\"experts\\" on leadership and businesses they will tell you that all great businesses are great because the work they do is based on their values, their purpose, their motivation, their \\"noble purpose\\" as tribal leadership talks about it.     this book was fantastic. i loved the way it was structured so you could read/listen to the chapter(s) or the level that you needed to hear. I listened to the entire version from front to back. it starts off with a bang and keeps the trajectory going and by the last few chapters you're in the stratosphere. you can listen to it again to get back on track, for expertise, motivation, inspiration or just to remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing and how important it is to work from your values and principles.     the other thing i loved about this book more than any other leadership book is that it was able to get at some basic human principles and truths to the point that it was almost kind of spiritual basis for human society and the motivation of individuals, cultures and businesses. Dave Logan was able to take this angle without borrowing \\"zen\\" language. The way he describes leadership and cultures and the process by which cultures grow and move forward, is the best tangible, action based approach to spirituality i've ever heard. Once you've found your truth and you try to do something with your truth, the best thing you can do, is to scale it to the size of a business, to build a community around the idea and understand how to continually re-focus on that core message. once the power of the human animal is unleashed in all it's creativity, intelligence and cooperative abilities, the sky is the limit.     it sounds radical, but when you think about it, there's a reason we are here, there's a purpose to it, there's such a thing as human culture and society that is an extension of whatever the reason there is life. and when you get right down to it, if this book wasn't able to take the principles of leadership to the level of a spiritual/value based truth, then that omission would have left the door wide open for someone else to make the connection.     Dave Logan and company found it.

1419551795|3.0|People studying for the GMAT need to know that they can't do it without buying the GMAC official guide. Just don't do it. The Kaplan questions are good but they're not the same as the official guide. The official guide is the prime source of good questions and practice. HOWEVER, the role of Kaplan books like this is to harvest the strategies from them and use them on the practice question from the official guide. Also, if you are breaking down a math skill, some of the simpler questions may be helpful. I honestly haven't used this book much since I have a Kaplan premier book, but I don't think there's tons of new stuff. Heck, I haven't really looked at it so I don't know. Read the other reviews. But my previous point stands.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|127 Hours (drama, biography, adventure)<br />Directed by Danny Boyle<br />Starring James Franco, Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy, Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2010   94 min   Rated R   Released Mar 01, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire won eight Oscars and many of his team return for 127 Hours. I'm always impressed at the variety of Boyle's subject matter. He's not afraid to tackle crime, drama, comedy, romance, horror or science fiction. This time he gives us a film based on a true story, dealing with events in the life of Aron Ralston.<br /><br />Ralston likes adventure. He's seen climbing and canyoneering in Utah and it's clear that he loves what he does. The events took place in 2003 and the title refers to the amount of time he was trapped in a canyon. Although that's a bit of a spoiler, it's the way he approaches the situation that makes this film a gripping story. Like Apollo 13, the drama depends on his actions rather than the known outcome.<br /><br />There's a scene near the start of the film in which Ralston reaches up into a cupboard. He touches a Swiss Army knife, but fails to retrieve it. That simple failure causes him a lot of trouble.<br /><br />We see Ralston reach the canyons and set off on his bike. When he crashes, we briefly consider the fact that he's out there alone, but he's able to continue. I think Boyle used the scene to prepare us for Ralston's eventual accident.<br /><br />Ralston meets two girls and we start to learn more about his true nature. He guides them to their destination, but by a route that isn't marked on the map. It leads to a scene in which the three deliberately drop into an underground pool of water. Boyle uses the scene as a contrast to those in which Ralston is trapped. Instead of being surrounded by water, he'll soon be relishing every single drop.<br /><br />The girls invite him to an upcoming party and eventually part ways. He travels on alone and soon suffers his accident. A loose boulder is dislodged when he steps on it and tumbles down a crevice after him, trapping his arm in the process. It's here that the film really starts. In fact, the title is displayed on the screen 17-minutes into the story to prove that point.<br /><br />What would you do if you were trapped, alone, and running out of food and water? Ralston tries anything he can think of. Brute force is his first thought, but he tries just about everything before considering his final options. Franco's acting is excellent throughout and he deserved his Oscar nomination.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like much of a visual feast, does it? A man trapped in a canyon. But Boyle uses all the tricks he can think of to make things interesting. We see a variety of unusual camera angles, such as a shot from the bottom of Ralston's flask while he's drinking. Boyle also zooms out to show the overall predicament and the surrounding terrain.<br /><br />Going 127 hours with hardly any food or water also means that Ralston is prone to dreaming or hallucinating. We also see flashbacks of his childhood and some more recent memories. He has a video camera with him and makes messages for his parents. Some are serious and others aren't.<br /><br />It's a brilliantly conceived way of telling the story.<br /><br />Can there be anyone who doesn't know Ralston's ultimate solution? I won't mention it in case it ruins the experience. A few of the scenes may be hard to watch for some viewers, but it would ruin the story if I mentioned which ones.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Boyleuses a variety of cameras and the picture quality depends on the source. When we first see the Utah scenery, the presentation is reference quality. Detail is strong and colors striking. But other scenes, shot with the cameras used in Slumdog Millionaire, are often dimly-lit. When Ralston uses his video camera, the image is deliberately grainy and washed-out. So this is a mixed bag, but the high rating is given because I think it's largely presented the way Boyle intended.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />Most of the film takes place when Ralston is alone and so quiet scenes dominate the film. But when there is noise, it's heightened. The clink of metal on rock, running water, or the movement of insects is all clearly defined in the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. I enjoyed A.R. Rahman's score and it matches the scenes well. There's a sense of adventure while Ralston is exploring, and more intense themes when he's trapped and trying to break free.<br /><br />Special Features 3.5/5<br /><br />The special features are all presented in high definition:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Danny Boyle, Producer Christian Colson and co-writer Simon Beaufoy.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (34:13)<br /><br />Search and Rescue (14:51) - Meeting some of the people involved in the rescue, as well as Ralston, his friends and family.<br /><br />127 Hours: An Extraordinary View (35:30) - Easily the best of the features. Boyle shows the set and explains how some of the scenes were shot. Franco gives his take on how Boyle approaches things.<br /><br />Short Film: God of Love (18:46) - An Oscar-winning short from the same studio, but not otherwise connected with 127 Hours.<br /><br />BD Live Exclusive (3:53)<br /><br />Sneak Peek<br /><br />Digital Copy<br /><br />I saw five of the Best Picture nominations in three days, including three in one day. The first of those three was 127 Hours and I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. But I was hooked within 15 minutes and it proved to be one of the best films of 2010. I would rank it in my Top 5.<br /><br />Franco has to carry the film in the way that Will Smith does in I Am Legend and Tom Hanks does in Cast Away. I like all three because it makes me feel like I'm sharing their predicament. Unless you are squeamish, 127 Hours is a great film with plenty of replay value. This was my fourth viewing and I'm very happy with this Blu-ray presentation.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5t with the cameras used in Slumdog Millionaire, are often dimly-lit.

Special Features 3.5/5    The special features are all presented in high definition:    Commentary by Director Danny Boyle, Producer Christian Colson and co-writer Simon Beaufoy.    Deleted Scenes (34:13)    Search and Rescue (14:51) - Meeting some of the people involved in the rescue, as well as Ralston, his friends and family.    127 Hours: An Extraordinary View (35:30) - Easily the best of the features. Boyle shows the set and explains how some of the scenes were shot. Franco gives his take on how Boyle approaches things.    Short Film: God of Love (18:46) - An Oscar-winning short from the same studio, but not otherwise connected with 127 Hours.    BD Live Exclusive (3:53)    Sneak Peek    Digital Copy    I saw five of the Best Picture nominations in three days, including three in one day. The first of those three was 127 Hours and I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. But I was hooked within 15 minutes and it proved to be one of the best films of 2010. I would rank it in my Top 5.     Franco has to carry the film in the way that Will Smith does in I Am Legend and Tom Hanks does in Cast Away. I like all three because it makes me feel like I'm sharing their predicament. Unless you are squeamish, 127 Hours is agreat film with plenty of replay value. This was my fourth viewing and I'm very happy with this Blu-ray presentation.    Overall score 4.5/5
0141040378|5.0|I think having classic books in your house is a great and important thing but when they come like this its a win win because they are a gorgeous addition to your bookshelves.  I have seen them in a lot of magazines lately and they are definitely making a statement.  The covers are a pretty, thin linen fabric.  The patterns appear to be stamped on.  I am working on collecting them all!
B003UESJEM|4.0|Timely and grim, this film reflects the cold hearted attitude of corporations today and their wretchedly overpaid CEO's. The gutted state of American manufacturing is also touched on. A distillation of the sad direction our values are headed. It would make a lizard weep.

B001UV4XI8|4.0|Yo soy un gran fan de Harry Potter por eso compre este combo pack la entrega fue a tiempo y el producto en excelente condiciones y del precio ni que hablar inigualable,el problema radica en que el Dvd no tiene extras y tampoco viene con audio en español solo subtitulado y decargar la copia digital es todo un lio ya que en mi caso soy de Ecuador y aqui no me permitio descargar la pelicula mediante itunes para el Ipod solo para formato windows media player adicional que no le puedes puedes poner subtitulos a ninguna de las dos versiones que te permite descargar una para una computadora fija y la otra para un dispositivo portatil asi que se descargaron las dos pero solo en ingles y aunque en la ayuda de la pagina de WB te dice como cambiarle el audio o ponerle subtitulos a la pelicula ya lo intente y no funciono,pero bueno la verdad es que todo esto se recompenza con toda la cantidad de extras(subtitulados en español/audio ingles) que hay en la pelicula en bluray que si viene con audio en español y que son increibles!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Ok, I would like to say that this is a very entertaining book with a well written plot and story to go along with it.  However, it was written for younger readers.  This is fine, but I did not realize this when I bought it.  However, despite that I was still greatly entertained and would recommend this book.
0375842209|5.0|When I received the book I ordered I was disappointed that I wouldn't be able to actually start reading.  The book smelled so horribly like smoke, I couldn't even keep the package open that it came in.  I'm not super nit-picky, but this was bad!  I emailed the seller, and within 4 business days I had a new copy in hand.  The associate that I dealt with was very professional and apologetic.  I am very pleased with how quickly the problem was fixed.  The best part is that they didn't even make me hassle with returning the other book.  It found it's way to my recycling bin at no cost.  Thank you Green Goddess Media!    Now for a book review...one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It's about a little girl's sad life experiences in Nazi Germany, and how she finds happiness in books.  The book is told from the perspective of \\"Death\\", making the style very unique to read.  You will smile a little and cry a lot!
0307595862|5.0|I heard it was terrifying and was a little nervous to read it...but even with almost 400 pages I read it in one weekend. I simply could not put it down. It was very well-paced and kept me really guessing who the killer was.
B003VIWO8Y|2.0|As with far too many autobiographies, I felt the book started strong, but sputtered out in later chapters. Mustaine is quite candid and brutally honest in discussing the distant past; avoiding excuses and revealing his shortcomings in bulk. However, as his story moves closer to the present, he begins glossing over issues, relying on scapegoats, and generally turns the memoir in to a redemption fluff piece. I don't want to say he cops out, as it is admirable that he apparently found peace in his life, but that is no excuse to suddenly pull back from critical examination. Again, a common problem with autobiographies is exemplified here; it's easy to openly discuss who you were, but much more difficult to fully reveal who you have become. Four stars for his frank memoir of the long gone self, one star for the lightweight examination of more current self

0240815807|5.0|This is easily one of the best books on audio I have ever read. From the moment I began reading about monitor choices, I was hooked. This guy really knows his stuff and communicates it clearly and in no uncertain terms.    Now, I am no major player in recording, but I have done my own home studio work since the halcyon days of the early cassette \\"portable studios\\" (late 70s early 80s - I still have my sweet Tascam 4 track Porta Studio, sigh...), so I do know a bit about the problems one encounters in small studios. I subscribed to most of the major recording magazines at the time (excluding the more engineering focused ones), and have several of the best-selling home recording books in my library, as well as some major professional standard texts on video/audio studio design and use (the Benson and Whittaker books).  This is the first book I have read which really addresses these issues from a hardcore professional stance for the small studio.    The first few chapters deal primarily with monitoring - a seriously under-appreciated and under-documented area in small studio recording. The author's discussion of speaker choices and placement, room acoustics, listening methods, hearing care, and so on, are first rate, and geared to small studio budgets and use, which I think is especially needed, given the explosion of computer based recording these days. The book is worth it for this section alone.    The only thing I would have added to all this was to suggest that anyone seriously interested in professional sound should get a good checkup from a professional audiologist to get a clear picture of their hearing. I recently had this done (for other reasons) and discovered that, although I have considerably better hearing than average for my age, I do have a decided notch at 4k - which explains why others find my mixes a bit too bright. Now I can adjust for that and get far better mixes. A good pilot knows when to trust his instruments over his senses.    Most of the book deals with using computers/software for the entire recording and mixing process, but much of the material is still valid for those retro types like me who still use dedicated outboard gear (no, I don't record on cassette any more, smarty pants - but I could...AND do a much better job than before. And don't knock tape - I once experimented with a DBX processor to master to the hifi audio tracks on VHS tape and got a similar signal to noise ratio to a CD, as well as a 2 hour record time per tape).    The discussions of EQ, compression, filtering, and other types of processing, as well as the recording process as a whole, are simply very, very good. You cannot go wrong in getting this book regardless of what and how you record. There is a tremendous amount of high quality information and advice here, much of it gleaned from seasoned pros with decades of experience. It is solid, practical advice you can use without having to have a multi-million dollar studio.    If this book does not improve your mixing capabilities and the quality of your work and experience in the process, then it is entirely your own fault. This is a great book. If you record and mix audio, get this book, period.
B002ZG997M|4.0|Some people say that this didn't really do anything new for the post-apocalyptic genre.  Well, what recent movie has?  Most movies are rehashed material old movies with slight twists.  This one plays on some great themes - traveling stranger, western shanty towns, etc.  Washington, Oldman and even Kunis all deliver as well as could be expected in this type of movie.  It has some really well filmed action sequences.  I agree that it does use that semi-sepia and tone a little much, but I imagine that's what the world will look like when we're nearly extinct anyway, so why nitpick?  If you like post-apocalyptic movies, this is definitely worth watching.  It won't change the world of movies, but presents a solid viewing.  The disc itself is a little disappointing in the special features, but for the right price is a good purchase.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a nice pocket sharpener that is also good for the toolbox. I have a number of knives I use for home repair, outdoors stuff, and around the house. they have gotten pretty dull over the years and this little puppy brought them back to life. A few of my knives has some deep nicks that will take some grinding and work with a stone to get into shape, but this sharpener at least got them useable again until I get around to that task.<br /><br />The serrated sharpener is easy to use and doesn't take much to take care of the curvy bits.

0743454537|5.0|So, here is my favorite author, Jodi Picoult. A story of a young girl who sues her parents for the right to her own body, deciding whether she should help her sister or not. Her case is taken up by a lawyer who is in court against her mother, who is an attorney.    An excellent story of love and sacrifice. Points of view and the hard choices we make in life. Better than the movie, they changed the ending. The ending in the book is much more poignant.    Love Picolt!

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This is Setterfield's first book. She was powerful and descriptive with emotions and stealth. It was exciting and relaxing at the same time. A good intrigue and suspense.    \\"There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.\\"    Powerful writing, powerful words in the hands of a wonderful manipulator of words. She captivated my heart with the way she writes not only what she writes. Big cheers!

3125737621|4.0|The book, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fiction story and it is a little boring. Someone has been stealing food from the farms and all the farmers joined together to get Mr. Fox and its family.I don't recommend this book because there are too many boring parts. Also there were many words that I did not understand. It has some interesting parts, but not enough to make the book a good one to read.
030746363X|5.0|This is for any skeptic out there. I was one until a coworker got this book and lost 30 pounds in 60 days. So I decided for 14 bucks I would give this a go. I started May 6th, today June 9th I have lost a total of 22 lbs (all fat). I've never liked dieting and haven't exercised regular in sometime but this book makes it so easy. When you read the first couple hundreds pages and start the diet you can't imagine its really this easy or could even work, but it does. Tim has done all the hard work, all you need to do is give him a small sum of money and he'll give you the tools to shave off pounds in the easiest possible way (I have ever experienced). I have more energy and feel better than I have in along time. I actually had to make a whole in my belt today so I knew it was time to leave a review. The proof is in the broccoli.
0099448599|2.0|\\"The Ninth Gate\\" is one of my favorite movies.  So I approached this book respectfully; I wanted to love this book.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid even if I'd picked up this book with no preconceptions, I wouldn't have liked it.  I can't believe I'm saying this about any book and movie combo, but the movie was better.  The book, by comparison, was boring and slow, and \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is hardly a film that rushes along at breakneck pace.  The characters were full of intrigue in the film, every one, but they all seemed dull to me here.  The movie was all plot and mystery, but the point of the book seemed to be to make as many literary references as possible with heavy discussion and debate of each.  Maybe it'd be more interesting to me if I were more familiar with the authors the characters endlessly discuss.  I'm bummed because I know people love this book, and I feel like I'm missing out on a classic.  Oh well.    Bottom line - if you're thinking about reading this book because you enjoyed \\"The Ninth Gate,\\" you may be disappointed.  They're very different animals.  I gave it two stars instead of one only because it inspired such a fascinating and compelling film.
B0041KKYEW|4.0|Approaching 400 reviews at Amazon, I don't think that I have a lot to add that hasn't already been said about Black Swan. But for what it's worth, my 2 cents is that it is a great movie. Well acted. Well scripted. And certainly well directed by the same guy that brought us [[ASIN:B001TOD9VI The Wrestler]]. Like The Wrestler, Black Swan is a dark drama that gets into the psyche of its main character. Natalie Portman is the Black Swan (as well as the White Swan), and she turns in a performance worthy of her Golden Globe and Oscar wins for Best Actress.<br /><br />In a nutshell, after Portman's character wins the lead in Swan Lake, she goes a bit cuckoo and essentially morphs into a living characterization of Odile, the Black Swan. But rest assured, if you've come looking for a movie solely about dance and ballet, you will either be pleasantly surprised or completely shocked. I was the former, although I did really know in advance that what lay ahead was a dark, foreboding movie about a gal that's not quite all there.<br /><br />Speaking of dark and foreboding, gotta hand it to the film's musical score team as well. They did an expert job at building tension where there was none and making the tense moments seem more normal...well, more normal perhaps for someone losing their mind (Portman, not me!).<br /><br />Mila Kunis costars, and she is as hot as her hot and heavy scenes with Portman are. I'm not sure that Kunis' performance warranted the Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but she should have won the MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss with Portman. Hubba hubba. Anyway....<br /><br />What I don't understand is all of the negative criticism that this movie received. I mean, even here at Amazon there are as many 1 and 2 star reviews combined as there are 5 star reviews. Makes me want to go all Odile on the 1 and 2 star reviewers and scream, \\"What were you expecting?!\\" Black Swan is an excellent movie and should not be missed by anyone into a good thriller.iller.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|I figured that for $10.99, I couldn't go wrong.  It appears I was right.  The photography was excellent and the 3D effects very good, over all, having only a very few areas that seemed a little flat.  I found it quite enjoyable and thought its message was pretty much on target.<br /><br />I'd like to address those one star reviews.  With the exception of the guy who didn't realized special equipment was needed to view the film in 3D, they all come from the political right.  Mention conservation or ecology to them and they immediately foam at the mouth.  They've bought the gospel of Exxon-Mobile, Chevron, et al, hook line and sinker.  There was even one guy who declared global warming defunct.  I wonder how he explains disappearing glaciers and melting polar ice caps.
159420229X|4.0|I loved reading this book. I found this book motivating myself to actually learn how to use my memory better. I am determined to memorize a deck of cards as a trick for my classroom and teach my students how to use memory(I need to learn how to first!).<br /><br />I found his journey very interesting. What I found so engaging was the whole premise that you don't have to have a gift or special skill through me for a loop. The author was able to actually be a top notch memory master and he is just as normal as the rest of us. The key to it is like anything else in life and that you have to train and prepare and practice.<br /><br />There were some parts that I did skim through. I was not that interested in the historical studies about brain and memory studies. I just wanted to know more about his journey and the tools and tricks he used to prepare.<br /><br />There are some references to education and how we(teachers) don't use memory properly. I would like to study and learn more to help my students. Reading this book from a teacher perspective I really want to take some of these skills and strategies mentioned in the book and apply them as a study set for my students during homeroom.<br /><br />I really liked a quote from the book that stated, \\"Our biggest failing may be that we forget how rarely we forget.\\" This quote just struck me as an important idea.<br /><br />I was very interested in the notion that photographic memory is a myth. This goes against everything I have ever heard or read. This idea I found to be very fascinating.<br /><br />I am curious to read more on Tony Buzan and learning about his techniques. The book addresses whether or not he has great ideas or if he is just trying to make money, but I would assume that anyone can take away something useful from all of his materials.<br /><br />This book if even not what I had intended to get out of the book is to learn some new brain strategies and skills and prove to students just how powerful their brains really are. Now it is time to apply some of the ideas mentioned in this book and make it happen.<br /><br />Come on deck of cards let us go down memory lane!s mentioned in this book and make it happen.    Come on deck of cards let us go down memory lane!
0525425578|5.0|I'm a good bit older than the suggested age range for this \\"juvenile reading\\" book.  However, it's as much of a page-turner as Grisham's adult thrillers.  Young Mr. Boone, middle school son of two lawyers, uses his smarts and legal knowledge to investigate a disappearance, the victim of which is a good friend.  With help from his friends, and his black-sheep uncle, will Theo find the missing friend?  It took only a few hours for me to find out, ripping through each page with great reading pleasure.

0440242401|5.0|Is it War and Peace?  No, it isn't but then it doesn't purport to be.  This book is a lovely escape into the kind of fantasy many of us dream about:  waking up to find yourself rich and beautiful beyond belief--and then going through the investigation of understanding how something like that could have happened.      I'm a big fan of Sophie Kinsella.  Her books are sheer entertainment.  In fact, I bought this book to take to our beach house last summer and it was the perfect read for lazing about the chaise lounge.  I highly recommend it for romance, as well as a bit of fantasy.

0316069353|4.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints always keeping his readers turning the pages and The Fifth Witness is no exception. Mickey Haller, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is back, expanding his practice and taking on a client whose home is being foreclosed on and who has just been charged with murder. In a case that could have been pulled from today's headlines, Mickey readies his defense of Lisa Trammel. As with any high profile murder-case, The Fifth Witness has its share of paparazzi, Hollywood moguls, mob types and of course the ex-wife prosecutor Maggie McFierce.<br />Fans of the movie \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" starring Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller will hopefully buy and read the book \\"The Fifth Witness\\" as it again brings Mickey into the courtroom in a David and Goliath type case. While the movie was enjoyable, in my opinion the books they are based on are always better.[[ASIN:0316069353 The Fifth Witness]]<br />Having read all of Mr Connelly's work from his very first mystery novel, the Edgar Award winner, \\"The Black Echo\\", I can tell you, \\"he just keeps getting better.\\"
0451169514|5.0|Any time I am asked what my favorite Stephen King novel is I always respond immediately that it is It.  Whenever I say this I get all kinds of responses from \\"Not The Stand?\\" to \\"It's too convoluted.\\" to \\"Too long!\\"  All of these responses just roll off of my back though because having read all of Stephen King's work I find that the one book that truly sums up the Stephen King experience is It.  For a lengthy novel it moves so quickly and reads so well and it is truly easy to lose yourself in its pages.  This book has every emotion known to man and I laughed and got teary-eyed and had the living daylights scared out of me all usually within a few pages of each other.  This book made me angry and happy and frustrated and sympathetic and I felt like I was one of the Losers' Club members (don't we all deep down inside?).  I found myself so wound up in this story that I found it difficult to leave it.
0316098329|5.0|This book is mesmerizing. I read a few of the one star reviews because I was really intrigued to find out why people would not love this book and to be fair, the first few pages are a little tiresome. It takes a while to adjust to Jack's voice and I did wonder whether it would flip to Ma's voice later in the novel but it doesn't. It's only when I finished the novel though that I realised how important those first few pages are in establishing what \\"Room\\" is really like. It's key to unveiling the impact of what happens later. The novel takes turns I didn't expect and the last 100 pages are compelling - I couldn't put it down. The conflict between Ma's needs and Jack's needs is insightful and I genuinely think this novel is unique.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Before purchasing this DVD, I was searching for a reliable seller with an acceptable price.  This DVD I bought, was in excellent state (new) and the price was reasonable.  The only (not significant) disadvantage, is that my DVD player cannot play it, so I can see it only on my laptop. This is probably because the shipping was for a different country (Hellas)than the country of origin (US) and I was aware about it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Great game overall. I like the progression, and they story line etc. I wish you could replay levels. It would be nice to earn extra monies if you best the high score for the level later. Eg. Your first play nets 250 coins, but your next play nets 300, your then earnings is 50 coins. I can't think of why this limitation exists. It seriously kills replay value.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|I recently viewed this movie during it's limited theater run, via Time Warner Cable. I'm a huge fan of horror and all off shoots, as well as cult cinema. I have to say that this picture was a breath of fresh air, compared to the commercial standard that's been burning the retina's for sometime. Stakeland is brought to you by the folks from Mulberry Street.(another fine film) Cast wise it's a virtual nobody list, although it does star the annoying little girl from the Halloween series. You know the one who couldn't talk, but could scream louder than all her cast members combined. Anyway, she's all grown up, and I must say she has come into her own, and is very attractive as the pregnant girl in this picture. The plot is a combination of the Road/28 Days Later/Mad Max/ and at least five other cult films from the last two decades. Now this may sound like old hat, but the screenwriting is fresh, and unpredictable. I wasn't quite sure what was going to happen next, because the twist coincide with different bit's of film from the past. It's not plagiarism by any means. The writers should be heralded for making this film, because I can go through my VHS and DVD collection and possibly down size. A wonderful film, it's horror, it's a cautionary tale, it's drama, it's suspense, there is action, A Little gore (maybe not enough for me, August Underground is in my top five)What more can you ask for. I look forward to this camp bank rolling this into another killer feature.

0847835073|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2INXJ48U8HXSY]]I've always been a huge fan of Monica Bellucci, and was hell-bent on getting this book when it first came out. Unfortunately, like many people, I wasn't fast enough to order it, as the book became unavailable seemingly days after it went up for sale on here. It was months before I was able to order a copy, but before the chance came, I kept trying to convince myself that I didn't want this book. After all, I'd only seen 4 or 5 scans of the photos contained within, and kept telling myself 'oh, it's probably just a bunch of the same style of black and white photos'. Boy I couldn't be more wrong. This book is worth every dollar, and I don't feel bad at all about paying the full retail price.<br /><br />It took a long time before I made it to the end of this book, as every photograph is a stunner, regardless of how simple some of them seem. The diversity in the photos is phenomenal- Monica in a busy dinner scene, her laying atop a stuffed lion, what looks like honey smeared all over her face as she licks it up, her in an obscenely tight corset, frolicking in the grass looking like she's genuinely having a good time...I could go on and on. My absolute favorite pictures are the 3 taken by Fabrizio Ferri of Monica when she was pregnant. I'd have included them in the attached video, but of course, like a good number of the photos, she's nude in them, and I can't exactly post that. And I love how the final pictures are of Monica with her child. It's a fitting end to everything. Regarding the photography, how many times can I repeat myself in saying that each photo is a keeper? This is the kind of thing that makes me want to get back into photography because of how inspiring it is.<br /><br />Hopefully the couple of images I got in the video portion of this review are helpful. I'm sorry that it jumps around- I had to cut segments together because I'd flip the page and get a nude photo (not that I'm complaining). But rest assured that what you see inthe video isn't even the tip of the iceberg: it's the mist around the tip of the iceberg. And if ordering the Italian version of the book is your only option, don't worry- there's not much text here aside from two pages of introductions in the very beginning and the last page of credits. The rest is big, beautiful photos. Any fan of Monica Bellucci needs to get a copy of this book, plain and simple.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Not bad for a first version. The gameplay is fun and addictive. With that said the graphics are definitely low res on the Asus Transformer tablet.  The game also runs a lot less smooth than it should on a dual core tegra.  It's obvious when running side by side with te ipad hd version. Hopefully updates will fix these issues.
B004ZZITEU|5.0|I have been a fan since alters. I have read the reviews. I have to say great job, Trey. Thanks for the continued experimentation and staying above the curve. Your guitar playing has astounded me since day one as well as your songwriting.  No this isnt Alters part 2.  I love that album also, but I cant stand it when the bands from this genre release the same album every year. This album may upset the diehards that cant see past 1990. However, I feel that the album is great because they continue to push the boundries of extreme music. The guitar work is mindblowing as usual and the drumming is killer. I am not saying that this is the best work Morbid Angel has ever put out, but I would rather have a band keep pushing forward rather than sit back and play the same old riffs and blastbeats. Most bands from this genre rehash the same old album time after time (you know who I mean). Cant wait to see them on tour.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I have listented to In Rainbows, the mix that I purchased on line from Radiohead many years ago, so much that I wore it out.  So I purchased this one.  This mix is disappointing.  It is 'way down in the mix.\\"  Those crisp, punchy percussive effects are lost in this one.  I'm glad to have it.  But I wish they'd release a mix that duplicates what I originally had.  I'd buy it!
0439023483|5.0|This is an excellent story set int a dystopian future based upon brutality. The story structure here follows the emotional and social struggles of our main character as she is brought into the Hunger Games to brutally murder not only fellow teenagers, but also a friend. As the story plays out we get to see the emotional struggles as this young adult has to try and deal with the stress and fallout of death, love, loss and success. It all comes to a great climax resulting a success that not only leaves our main character vulnerable, but also questioning who she is.     The only major complaint is the ending of the book does leave us hanging a bit with its abruptness. I have not read a book that brought me through so many emotions in a very long time.
B0030L0AOC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Even though I'm in my late twenties, this book recreated the anxiety and stress most people experience in junior high and high school. I had a hard time putting it down because I wanted to know what happened next -- why a healthy girl would kill herself and then send (almost) strangers the story of her life on cassette. It really made me think about how even inaction could harm someone's self-esteem. Junior high and high school are tough times to stand against the majority, but in hindsight, those are often the times you need to.
B003UESJEM|4.0|The Company Men explores the very contemporary issues of the effect of redundancy during a recession and its specific effect on the personal lives of the people at the receiving end of the dreaded layoff notice. There are several stages to the process. Firstly, from the corporate perspective the company, in this case a company in shipbuilding, is under enormous pressure to perform for its stockholders as the economic slump bites and orders fall off. The all too predictable response is to cut costs and since payroll is the biggest cost, this means cutting jobs.<br /><br />The axe cuts deep and the company is forced to make difficult decisions to terminate long serving and loyal staff. The film focuses on three of these people and explores the various personal issues involved. There is initial incredulity and some bitterness that they could have been treated in this way, but optimism about finding a new job. Then realisation that it is difficult in a harsh economic climate for someone of 37 to find employment, let alone someone nearing retirement. People react in different ways to both the emotional issues of being out of a job and the economic implications and most of the film focuses on these aspects.<br /><br />This an interesting and absorbing film, but in many ways depressing as the situation it describes is one which many people will be able to relate to or will have experienced at some stage in their lives. Ben Affleck plays a confident Sales Director, Chris Cooper is the older, senior executive, who has worked his way up from the shop floor and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the company's founders and a senior statesman. Affleck is particularly outstanding and his reaction to the economic reality of his new status is quite revealing as the trappings of his middle class life style are impacted. You may not feel a lot of sympathy for the plight of these guys as they are obviously well off, but expenditure grows to the level of income and when the income stops............<br /><br />So to summarise, a worthwhile film which explores important and real life issues, but certainly not a light hearted way to while away an hour or two.rise, a worthwhile film which explores important and real life issues, but certainly not a light hearted way to while away an hour or two.
0307593495|5.0|Although I have read other books by Henning Mankell, this is the first Kurt Wallander novel that I have read.  Although it is not necessary to have read the earlier Wallander books to follow the storyline of the The Troubled Man or to enjoy the characters, I believe that prior knowledge of Kurt Wallander and the other characters would have lent more depth to the characters and more meeting to some of the connections between the characters which are made.    The beginning of the book is very engrossing as the plot draws the reader right into the story.  Wallander is introduced by his daughter to Håkan, a former submarine captain for the Swedish Navy and father of Wallander's daughter's partner.  During a birthday party Håkan has a private moment with Wallander during which Håkan speaks about an incident from many years ago when Warsaw Pact submarines were found in Swedish territorial waters.  One of the submarines was cornered in a harbor and the Swedish Navy was preparing to lay depth charges to force the submarine to surface.  At the last minute, Håkan was ordered, much to his amazement and frustration to let the foreign submarine escape.  Despite the hesitation of his peers to get involved, Håkan searches for answers, but never solved the mystery of why the submarine was allowed to escape.  The incident is something that haunts Håkan and something for which he still wants answers.  A few days after the conversation at the party, Håkan goes missing.  A week later, Håkan's wife also disappears.  Although Wallander is not assigned the case, he begins his own investigation during his free time due to his connections with the family.  The investigation takes Wallander from Ystad to Copenhagen to Stockholm to Berlin as he tries to follow the loose strings of evidence that were left behind.      As Wallander begins his investigation, the book begins to take a different tone.  Wallander is getting old and his body and his life are not always as he would like.  Wesee his body crumbling and betraying him as his mind wanders into the regrets and failures of the past.  The tone of the book becomes melancholy.  For example, Wallander traces a lead to a former waitress at a private naval club.  Wallander goes to visit one of the now elderly waitresses form the club whose husband we learn was killed only two years after they were married.  She believed that she had found and then lost her true love and never sought love again.  She decided to live alone in a retirement community rather than to live near her son and his family.  The woman isn't expecting Wallander but he finds her made up and dressed nicely as if she was expecting a special guest.  Wallander realizes that she does this in the hope that someone, someday will visit her, but visitors, he is told are rare.    Wallander discovers another lead which turns out to be a woman who was born with severe mental impairments, no arms and blurred vision.  The only visitor that she ever received was her father who came to see her once a week.  The rest of her family either denied her existence or never knew of her existence.  And now that her father has disappeared, no one will visit her again.    And these are just two of the examples of what the author describes as the book nears its ending.  It is as if the author was expressing through his writing his own sadness at the upcoming conclusion of the book.      Although the conclusion of the mystery was a bit transparent, Wallander's inability to make the connections between clues quicker is yet another example of his mind failing him as he gets older.  There are loose ends which go unexplained, but I was willing to let them go and to accept the simplicity of the outcome.    I found this book to be really difficult to put down, but at the same time really depressing to read.  So much sadness is uncovered as the investigation proceeds.  The writing is excellent and the author most certainly conveys the character's feelings of fear and frustration as he gets older.  It is certainly a memorable book.
1439133948|1.0|I love the Vorkosigan Saga, but this is the weakest book in the series and it is hard not to think that her publishers have not pushed her  to meet the demands of her fans. The plot line is weak and not the suspenseful and clever reading that we have grown to love. Her main characters are drawn shallowly. The best writing is really the in the set of epilogues.     I feel that this has spoiled the series a little for me and am very disappointed.

B000002O3I|5.0|If someone told me I could only listen to one album out of my collection for the rest of my life, I'm pretty certain I would have to pick this one. I wasn't even a blues guy when I bought it. I was a hard core classic rock guy trying to get to the bottom of why those late 60's and early 70's guys were so awesome. Turns out they had some top notch role models. For me, Howlin' Wolf was the high point in the history of the blues and this album (actually two albums combined) contains the majority of his timeless classics. Wolf's voice and harmonica playing, combined with Hubert Sumlin's instantly recognizable guitar playing and surrounded always by an outstanding backing band, this music never sounds contrived or uninspired - always raw like you were hearing them play it directly to you. If you love the blues or classic rock or are just curious about the blues, you must get this album.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Not much that can be said about this knife that you will not read in the other 140+ reviews.  This is a solid knife which is apparent as soon as you pick it up.  The knife is heavy as it would need to be in order to perform many of the tasks people describe in their reviews.  The knife came sharp although not shaving sharp which was easily addressed in a few minutes.  I also agree with the many comments of being able to hand this knife down to my kids, it is American made and the quality is evident.  The grip is more suited for a medium to large hand.  The grip material itself seams OK to me and I don't quite see what all the complaints are about the grip material; is it the best grip ever? no but I also do not feel I need to spent $40 on new grips. Probably not the knife I would take backpacking but defiantly camping due to weight.
0679420266|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Along with Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Albert Camus's Monseiur Meursault in \\"The Stranger\\" (hereafter TS) is probably the most inscrutably and bafflingly passive character in all of literature. At least Melville suggests that Bartleby's obstinate refusal to work, to function, to even live may have resulted from the stifling seclusion of the impersonal corporate world. TS does not even attempt to explain Meursault's impassive, impersonal view of life (although, like Bartleby, he is a corporate clerk, if slightly more animated). Meursault reminded me of an android, or more fittingly, an alien (perhaps the novella should have been entitled \\"The Alien\\") or \\"pod person\\", who superficially resembles a human but is not quite familiar with most human emotions. He functions more like a beast that satisfies basic carnal needs (warmth, sex, a cigarette) and does what he has to do to survive.<br /><br />TS is a Hemingwayesque novel, with simple, unpretentious language, and a protagonist that may remind you of Hemingway's disillusioned ex-patriates. However, the ex-pats's behavior could at least be attributed to World War I. What is Meursault's excuse? Whatever it is, it is probably irrelevant. The novel is divided into roughly three parts 1) Meursault's attendance at his mother's funeral, 2) Meursault's daily \\"life\\" activities, and 3) Meursault's arrest, incarceration, and trial after his killing of an Arab. In the first third, to the shock and dismay of many, Meursault barely remembers to attend his mother's funeral. He does not want to see the body before the coffin closes, and he does not openly grieve for her. The clerics, mourners, and church authorities show more compassion than he. They also seem to condemn Meursault for his apparent lack of regard and knowledge about his mother, including the fact that he had her consigned to a nursing home. Meursault merely matter-of-fact states that he and his mother by common design had little to do with each other and that it really was more convenient and beneficial that she stay at a home. Tellingly, he also reveals that Mother was not exactly a religious person, and that he apparently inherited that trait.<br /><br />The second third of the novel details Meursault's unremarkable daily activities in Algiers, Algeria. He is not completely anti-social since he has a quasi-girlfriend Marie, another quasi-friend Raymond, and a crotchedy old neighbor Salmano with whom he interacts. But in those interactions, he is not spiritually there. He reacts robotically and doesn't really seem to care about their feelings. Even when he senses that he has offended someone (usually with brutal honesty), Meursault tries to make amends not because of solicitude  but because of vague annoyance with their behavior. Meursault eats, sleeps, swims, has sex with Marie, smokes, and walks, all without any ostensible purpose. Still, he claims his life \\"suits him\\" and he has no real incentive to change it.<br /><br />Meursault's dull, prison-like existence begins radically changing when he helps his \\"pal\\" Raymond, a pimp, discipline an \\"unruly\\" prostitute by composing a threatening letter. This incites the ire of the prostitute's brother, who is part of an Arab gang that starts to stalk Raymond. Meursault, Raymond, and a third party, Masson eventually meet and fight the gang on a beach. Raymond is wounded and Meursault and Masson escort Raymond back to Masson's bungalow by the shore. Meursault somehow acquires Raymond's gun and, under the apparent influence of scorching heat, goes back down the beach, faces a remaining gang member, and fatally pumps five bullets into him.<br /><br />Imprisoned, Meursault dispassionately awaits his homicide trial.  On the whole, he adjusts to prison life surprisingly well, probably because it doesn't differ greatly from the prison of the outside world.  He has merely traded the larger \\"cell\\" of the world for the smaller and somewhat more restrictive literal one.  The only thing he really seems to miss from his former life, such as it was, was the sun and wind on his face.  Meursault manages to frustrate his appointed lawyer and the magistrate with his phlegmatic personality and unemotional disinterest in his own fate and anything else.  Again, he is condemned for his \\"callous\\" attitude towards his mother, and, astonishingly, for his lack of belief in Christianity.  Here, Camus ironically belies the impartial, logical nature of the legal profession with the still relevant observation that even the most heinous suspects could \\"save themselves\\" if they demonstrate the proper remorse and  religious penance.  Meursault doesn't do that because he simply doesn't believe in it.<br /><br />During the trial, the prosecution continues the condemnation of Meursault as a monstrous, unfeeling mother abuser whose grotesquely inconsiderate and unrepentant nature would predispose him to murder.  Camus continues his assault on the legal profession by focusing on its ad hominem attack of Meursault rather than upon the crime's evidence.  Nonetheless, the prosecution's character assassination is shockingly effective and Meursault is consigned to the guillotine.<br /><br />Even this doom fails to rouse Meursault much.  Instead, he ponders some last-minute, deus-ex-machina act that will save his skin, or even a mad dash for freedom, or how he will behave at the hour of death.  The prison chaplain makes a last ditch effort to have Meursault repent before his execution.  Meursault furiously replies that that belief system was a nonsensical illusion, so to speak, and that only one's physical life and impending death, even in the face of an empty, uncaring universe, were real.  After his tirade, Meursault only wishes that hostile spectators witness his decapitation.<br /><br />Everyone seems to tout TS as an existential, hopeless novella with a reprehensibly godless and insubstantial \\"hero\\".  That assessment, in my opinion, doesn't penetrate far enough.  I believe that throughout TS, in his distorted, passive-aggressive way, Meursault seeks the meaning of existence.  Although he protests that he is content with his life, he really isn't.  Otherwise, why commit the murder? He wants a thrill; he wants to feel alive, he is daring God or some other supernatural force to show him the meaning of life.  However, TS suggests that passively waiting for God to do his thing is not the answer.  Humankind must make the effort to find meaning, purpose, and happiness in life.  Meursault does not realize this until nearly the end of the novel, after his outburst against the chaplain.  All along, paradoxically enough, his seemingly aimless life led against \\"the benign indifference of the universe\\" had meaning for him, even if for him it is the only true life.  And now his hopefully eventful death will cement that meaning.  Meursault has his answer, even if some of us may not like it.<br /><br />As the magistrate stated in TS, \\"...[A]ll men believe in God, even those who reject Him.\\"  Even professed \\"existentialists\\"..

B004LWZW42|5.0|What drew me to check out X-Men: First Class was not any particular love of comic books nor any particular fondness of the previous films. What drew me to this film was the presence of actor Michael Fassbender, whose increasingly eclectic work has continued to impress me more and more with each new film he appears in. I recall little about the first three X-Men films, besides that I found them enjoyable and I admit that I haven't even bothered to see X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I figured it was only a matter of time before Fox rebooted the X-Men series after the lackluster reception of the last two X-Men films. Bringing in director Matthew Vaughn, the director of 2010's cult hit Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class is a summer blockbuster that delivers on all fronts, while reinventing and re-energizing the series.     The film opens with the same scene that opened the first film, introducing us to Erik Lehnsherr as he's separated from his mother at a Nazi prison camp. These first scenes, particularly Erik meeting his mortal enemy Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), are surprisingly effective. Several years later, the film sets itself up against the backdrop of the 1960s Cuban Missile Crisis as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is recruited by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) to assemble a team of mutants for the purpose of stopping Shaw from triggering World War III. Charles forms a partnership with the vengeful Erik (Fassbender) to help him assemble the team, which already consists of Charles' adopted sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), and the film leads us through the events that culminate in Charles, Erik, and Raven becoming Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique, respectively.    The story and screenplay give credit to six people total and the key to the success of this movie may be that one of those six people is Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men films whose absence may have been what guided the last two films into mediocrity. His involvement, Vaughn as the director, and the changing of the time period all have significant impact on the film's success. The material seems much more at home in the 60s time period, while also helping to establish a different atmosphere and tone that separates it from the other films in the series.Vaughn emphasizes a steely, gray palette, an atmospheric visual aesthetic that gives the film a much bleaker tone than it's predecessors. He's assisted in establishing this effective atmosphere by the ominous musical score by Henry Jackman that lends to the atmosphere and builds the suspense.    There is some great talent in front of the camera. Lawrence, a recent Oscar nominee is a perfect fit for the young Mystique and Kevin Bacon gives a diabolical performance as the antagonist, but it is Michael Fassbender whom I believe will walk away from this film a star. It's sad that with so many great roles behind him in the last few years Fassbender has to play Magneto to finally get the recognition he deserves. With that said, Fassbender's performance as Magneto is fascinating to watch and brings a new level of depth to the character. His charismatic performance shows Erik as a tortured soul, but also a (forgive me for not being more eloquent, but no term I can think of is better) bada**. Furthermore, he shares remarkably strong chemistry with McAvoy and these two work well enough together to carry more films in this series.     What really elevates the material beyond it's predecessors and, for that matter, most superhero movies, is the level of drama and genuine humanity it contains. It's a complete success as a summer action film, but it's much more than that; it's a genuinely good, well-made film. In addition to that, it's almost unbearably entertaining. I found it riveting for it's entire 132-minute running time, while marveling at how it's so insanely entertaining without relying on contrived, repetitive, action sequences to guide its entertainment value. There are some negative elements; Mystique'smakeup looks much cheaper than it did in previous incarnations and there is the occasional cheesy line of dialogue, but none of this was substantial enough to negatively impact my view of the film.     X-Men: First Class is exactly what it's title implies; first class. Backed by a script that is both entertaining and intelligent, guided by great direction, and brought to life by a tremendous cast, I have no reservations calling this the best X-Men film yet. It has all the things you could want from a summer blockbuster; action, adventure, intelligence, soul, Magneto exacting revenge on Nazi's, great performances, and one of the funniest cameos I've seen in a long time. It's not a masterpiece, as it sticks a little too close to the summer-film template but, be that as it may, the heart must rule the head and I have no qualms admitting that I loved it.    GRADE: A-

B000OZ28IS|5.0|This is an underrated book. The story is exciting and with great purpose while Boyd's prose really brings to life two worlds at once. This is literary fiction mixed with suspense at its best.
0743201140|3.0|Much of the book hinges on the results of an online assessment. The access code to this is included with the book. If someone has already used it, you are out of luck. The only way to get one is to buy a new $18 book. Access codes can only be used once, no exceptions. My initial thought was to go ahead and buy a new one then I could just pass it along to someone else, but then they will be in the same mess. I'll give the first part of the book 5 stars, but very disappointed that I can't enjoy the second half. If anyone has a brilliant solution, please let me know!

How, for example, did a fisherman transform into a sword swinging warrior over-night?

B000JLSM00|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray disc of The Searchers.     Everyone already knows the movie is a classic. One of the finest westerns ever; it's number three on my list of the greatest westerns ever made:    Felix Cruz's List of the Greatest Westerns:    1. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly  2. The Wild Bunch  3. The Searchers  4. Once Upon a Time in the West  5. Stagecoach    John Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards is arguably his finest role, and if you haven't seen this film then do yourself a huge favor and order it now, but make sure you get the Blu-ray edition. Not only is it loaded with extras, including an introduction from Patrick Wayne (John's son), but the gorgeous cinematography is enhanced ten-fold by the picture quality of the Blu-ray. The memorable opening scene when the door is opened, leading the audience out to Monument Valley, is even more spectacular with the vibrant colors pulling us into the film. At times you will find yourself mesmerized by the enhanced wide shots of Monument Valley in the way that only John Ford could film it. Even some of the close-ups of a grizzled John Wayne seem to pack more of a punch on Blu-ray.    If you aren't familiar with the story, here's a brief synopsis: Ethan Edwards is a Civil War veteran who goes on a years-long journey, with his nephew, to track down and rescue his young niece after she was kidnapped by Comanches.     The Searchers was always a great film, but the Blu-ray edition manages to make it even better. Check it out.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My son started playing this and I couldn't get him away from his DS, then I downloaded a version for my Droid phone and started playing. Wow. It's hard to walk away from!     Who would think that there was so much satisfaction in annihilating zombies who walk slowly towards your house. Every level reached gives you another item in your armory to battle the zombies. But every new level adds another zombie type that has a better way of getting through your defenses.  Once you've completed all the levels, there are tons of things to do to keep the game going. You can play through again with a slight twist on each level, making it harder to complete.  Then there are quick plays and accomplishments that require you to play levels with great restrictions.    The value is great since there is so much to do after 'beating' the game the first time. The graphics are funny and the game can be really challenging at times.    Multiple players can have saved games and you can resume levels after pausing.  I'm running it on a Droid Incredible and have experienced a couple of glitches when you pause some of the Quick Play games and try to go back to them. When you resume or restart the level, it crashes. Sometimes a restart on the phone works but there are no two quick play levels that I can't get back too.    The graphics are great on the Droid, better graphics than the DS version!    A ton of unexpected and addictive fun!

And despite the 965 A.D. date scripted to the war of the Frost Giants, that story really does have Ice Age roots.  Maybe even 10,965 B.C. if one considers M'jolnir was reputedly a stone hammer.  And like other myths, it became 'forged' after the Iron Age re-telling and possibly before the birth of Norse written language.<br /><br />How admirably have the producers inducted a stone age myth into the 21st century?  I could have sworn that that New Mexico opening footage was about to insert theme music from the X-Files.  And the government security agency which moved in and surrounded Mjolnir could have been borrowed from Chis Carter's efforts as well.  It's refreshing to see the Marvel Comics adaptation of Cellular and WiFi technology and laptops in their film offerings here. (Devices which didn't exist back when I used to read Thor & Dr. Strange.)  I appreciated it just as much when they released an animated Dr. Strange.  It shows respect to the contemporary audience for their product.<br /><br />Considering that J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed his 'Middle Earth' (in the common tongue) from the Norse, 'Midgard', I see a glimpse of other dimensions of the Marvel multiverse emerging.  There's no Hobbits here, just a reckless immortal who suddenly learns the frailty of mortality, and it's nobility.  (This isn't the original Donald Blake alter ego of Thor from the comic series.)<br /><br />A sub plot of Loki scheming to destroy an entire race (the Frost Giants home world Jotunheim) is truly worthy of the Prince of Mischief.  Comic or not.  Thor is known as the 'friend of man', and for his strength and valor.  Likewise Loki, (blood brother to Odin himself) is known for his cunning and subtlety.  And these roles cast by the Marvel team are outstanding!<br /><br />I would have liked to see Fenris, wolfen offspring of Loki.would have liked to see Fenris, wolfen offspring of Loki.
B003UESJ9M|2.0|What do you think of a movie that has good actors, okay songs, a story to be listened to and comes out poor? The acting was good for the most part. The story could have been much better. I don't think this was based on any single true life story, but easily could have been (Cobain, Presley etc). Even though Beau was 'helping', he had his own reason for making sure the marriage didn't work. It made him look like the hero, but really he was just as much the problem dividing the marriage. To me the movie wasn't predictable. I thought 'alright, she's finally coming to her senses' nope! Perhaps it was her only way out.   Depressing! I like to see people brought out of their messes, lives changed. You'll have to look elsewhere for that. In the end what took place (after the death) was going to happen even before she took her life, except her husband was no longer her manager. So, what was the point, considering it's fiction? Change the last 5-10 minutes and you could've had a great film.  The movie ended with no redeemable value. Two good messages: drugs don't fix your problems and \\"Find what you love [passionate about] and do it.\\"

1594744769|4.0|The dreams of a six year old boy are nothing more than to be just like the grandfather he's loved and worshiped as long as he can remember. This very same grandfather who's told him of amazing children who can levitate or hold flame in their hands or of boys who are invisible or have bees living inside of them. But, he's also told of the monsters that hide in the shadows who want to kill those same people and himself. Our six year old, Jacob, loves this world of amazing and horror that his grandfather has told him of - all experienced by himself while living at an orphanage in Whales.    However, at the age of seven, our dear Jacob doesn't believe in these tales any longer and decides that it's a lighter side to the dark that was his grandfathers true life, growing up in Europe during World War II. Jacob still loves and worships the ground his grandfather walks on, but in the end, is it enough?    With a twisted plot that will surprise you at every turn, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a wondrously, deranged story of the peculiar things that are all around us. The amazing story of, now teenaged, Jacob and the list of trials he must get through to find the road through his grandfather's head, is nothing short of intriguing and fascinating. I feel that Ransom Riggs had me in mind when he went to work on this fabulous story about an abandoned orphanage and the many peculiar children that at, one point, inhibited such a place. With descriptions that make you feel like you've become a part of the landscaping, and the snarky replies of Jacob himself, we see past and present meld together in what could only be called a spectacular presentation of supernatural delight.    And throughout the book, the surprises never stop giving. With an original story that's never been told, Mr. Riggs grasps the mind of his readers, never to give them up until the very last page has turned. Every page giving something amazing to it's handler, whether it be words of delight orimages of wonder that are at time so deranged, you can't help but look at them and ponder if something so extreme is actually possible. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was so riveting and immensely entertaining, I never wanted to put it down. And while Mr. Riggs has undoubtedly created an intense, scary plot, he still is able to add to it with the funny narrations of Jacob and his grandfather and the heartache of what separation and time does to all, no matter who or what they are. With a well developed cast of characters, plot and location each moment feels like you were there, experiencing it firsthand, your heart beating along with Jacobs as he learns just what it is to be peculiar. (Rating: 4.5/5)
B0012HCASA|5.0|This is the beginning of a two season SiFi TV series that is now cancelled. This was a big disappointment. This was a great fist two seasons and was getting better each show. The directing, acting, production and casting is the equal of any great SiFi series you may know like BSG or Stargate Universe, IMHO.    Lena Headey playing Sarah Connors is adequate although I prefer Linda Hamilton. I think this is just a matter of taste on my part. Thomas Dekker playing John Conner I find more convincing with more screen presence than Edward Furlong in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. I find Furlong spends too much time screaming in a way I find very annoying in Judgement Day. This could be the fault of the directing I suppose. Nick Stahl as Connor in The Rise of the Machine was far better than either Furlong or Dekker. I thought Stahl was perfect for John's part . . . moody, introverted but with the ability to take on a commanding presence when needed which Dekker doesn't really seem to have.    Speaking of The Rise of the Machine, Clair Danes is a wonderful addition to the cast of The Rise of the Machines, IMO. And what about Arnold. Well . . . there is only one Arnold.    An interesting alternative supplied in The Sarah Conner Chronicles is Cameron Phillips playing the helpful Terminator. Summer Glau is a screen stealer in almost every episode. She is cold, calculating, lethal and everything a Terminator should be.    The excellent cast continues with the acting of Richard Jones as FBI agent James Ellison, and Brian Austin Green as Derik Reese, cousin to Kyle Reese, father of John Conner.    Everything considered this was looking like a winner for several more seasons. To bad the viewer ratings weren't high enough.

Glad it was free but like almost all games I don't think I'd pay money for it.
1439190275|5.0|I have most of the indicators of Metabolic Syndrome; as I have gotten older, the disease has progressed, so I continue to gain weight, despite various diets. However, Atkins works. When I am on the regime, I lose weight and my symptoms improve. When I go off the diet and just \\"eat sensibly\\", I gain weight and my BP soars.  As drastic as it seems, if I can convince myself that being overweight is an indicator of diabetes in the beginning stages, it will be easier to accept the LIFETIME changes that must occur. Individuals with chronic disease endure: kidney dialysis, carrying oxygen, taking harsh meds with strong side effects, insulin injections and so on. So compared to these folks, is sticking to a structured program really so difficult.  Also, thinking of myself as diabetic, will help me say \\"no\\" to sugar/carb rich foods, especially in social settings. I can just say: \\"No thank you, I am diabetic\\"; then most will understand. And for you brainwashed Atkins enemies, the plan has changed as the science has improved: now the emphasis is on glycemic load for carbs and \\"healthy\\" proteins, fats, and oil. It is NOT just eating bacon, ham, butter, and steak with sour cream every day. That is a myth and a lie.

B002WY64HA|1.0|Having recently 'discovered' vinyl I decided to buy this album without downloading any of the tracks first. Analog all the way, baby!    I have listened to the album twice and, while that may not sound like a lot, I am certain that I will have no interest in putting it on again. There is nothing here that I would call a good song. For sure, there are some catchy hooks here and there, but the lyrics are just dismal and completely at odds with the rather grandiose symphonic feeling of the music. If you're someone who doesn't care to listen to the words then I can kind of understand how you might like this (assuming that waily-croaky androgynous angst-ridden vocal style doesn't grate with you ...) But listening to these lyrics, words like 'silly', 'young' and 'precious' kept springing to mind. Honestly, it reads like a precocious grade 9's English project. I just cannot get behind such lightweight songwriting. Incidentally, while lyrics don't have to rhyme, I do appreciate it if there's some kind of metre. It is a song, after all, and not to bother getting the number of syllables roughly in the ballpark seems kind of lazy.    I debated whether or not to review this. Music is, after all, a matter of personal taste. I probably would not have bothered except for the fact that the overall level of raving about this group is off the scale and I expected to at least like, if not love it. And I really don't.

0062060554|4.0|What if each and every morning you awaken to a world that is new, with no leftover feeling of fear or dread or happiness or anticipation?  Because you have no memory of yesterday, or last week, or last year, each day is a blank slate, a new beginning.  That is the world Christine inhabits in Before I Go To Sleep, a novel that explores exactly how memory makes us who we are, and how it directs our skills, our relationships, our judgement, our survival.  It's a tantalizing yet harrowing thought; there are times we think we'd like to forget...but not really.  Because memory is what makes us human and whole and able.  Without it,  we are, as Christine notes, like animals, with no sense of the past or beyond today, the future.<br /><br />Christine's days begin in confusion followed by horror, as she awakes to find she is twenty years older than she thinks, that the stranger beside her is her husband, Ben, that she has been like this since an accident years ago that robbed her of memory, and that she forgets it all again each night when she sleeps.  Her life is, quite literally, a waking nightmare, until she hears from a doctor who is studying her case and learns of the journal he has suggested she keep.  Reading her daily entries grounds her, as she gradually begins to recall scattered bits of her former life.  But when her memories and her related past do not match up, when she learns facts that do not fit assurances, Christine begins to question everything, unsure who to trust or believe, including herself.<br /><br />As a victim of memory loss, Christine is a sympathetic but not wholly tragic character, unlike another fictional lost self, Paul Cole, in Donald E. Westlake's searing masterpiece of forgetting, the incomparable MEMORY.  Perhaps it is that Christine does not feel complete and fully knowable.  Or, perhaps, it is because Christine's struggles to remember, to learn the truth, to solve the mystery of herself is, rather than a study of character, just that:  a mystery we expect to be solved.  The suspense of whether it will or will not be is mostly skillfully maintained, although the middle of the novel sags somewhat, unfortunately, dragged down by lack of forward movement in an effort to prolong tension.  And the end, with its hint of deus ex machina, and incomplete denouement, is a bit of a let down.  But on the whole Before I Go To Sleep is a well written, entertaining suspense story with a well thought out treatise on what memory means.  It deserves its praise, especially for a debut novel, and a film option seems predictably certain.pect to be solved.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Stargate Universe Seasons 1 and 2, was an awesome show to watch every week. It was like Stargate mixed in with a little bit of Battlestar Galactica, and some Star Trek Voyager, and some other sci-fi, because the crew had low supples and were stranded lights years from earth on Destiny. Each weeks episode was just right and/or gripping, I personally never lost interest in any of the two seasons. It was the ONLY great show I'd watch on Cable. The rest was of the crap shows on SyFy were wrestling, Grade F+ SyFy movies, and stupid ghost/paranormal crap shows. Way to FAIL (SyFail) SyFy! Now there's nothing good to watch on Cable!<br /><br />So, Stargate Universe = AWESOME!<br /><br />SyFail = Stupid Network
B004SEUJKU|5.0|People complain about multiple releases.  I collect movies and most popular movies are released several times on the most popular media form.    Short of remastering the film frame by frame I doubt that you will ever get the picture or sound quality of let's say \\"Pirates of the Caribbean.\\"      Face it Orion (the distributor) was not a major distributor and the Terminator was not expected to be the cult hit that it became.    There are many movies on the market which picture quality falls short of our sophisicated expectations.  As our audio/visual technology advances most of the movies that you are purchasing now will look like trash.    If you like the movie and have the money to spare don't let a review dissuade you.  See for yourself.  Rent a copy from Netflix or Red Box then make your decision.
0756405890|1.0|Kvothe has super special unique hair and eyes that both change color with his mood. He can also do literally everything: Learn a language in a day or two? No problem. Take out a pack of demons who could kill a whole town? Sure!  If it sounds overbearingly cool, trust me, Kvothe can do it, and he'll do it without getting a single shining, exquisitely fire-red strand of hair out of place.    He has a silly name to the point where I was genuinely surprised that Rothfuss didn't manage to cram a few y's in there. He *narrates* how it's pronounced - aloud, to another character - just so that the reader can see how to say it.  \\"Kvothe, pronounced quoth\\" -- say that aloud.  Doesn't make much sense to tell someone the pronunciation of a word you've just said as opposed to spelling it out, does it?    Even if you can somehow overlook or accept Kvothe's saccharine I'M SUPER AWESOME SEXY COOL NO REALLY GUYS brand of Gary Stu, Rothfuss's writing is just not that great.  Most noticeably, he tends towards repetitive phrases and sentence structures that make the book feel even more predictable and awkward than it might otherwise.  That's a pretty big flaw in a book the length of this one with a character as tiresome as Kvothe is.    Frankly, if this series was anything but profic it would be derided as Mary Sue wish-fulfillment garbage.  I think it's escaping under the John Ringo clause, but I'm still really not sure why everyone seems to like it so unashamedly.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|Hollywood is spawning them these days faster than they used to the likes of Moses and Ben Hur in the past.     Super-intelligent alien Paul (Seth Rogen!

But... what a cosmic surprise... that concept is not new or original, it is in fact over 3000 years old, when ancient Reviewer wrote down the following: Fools say in their hearts, \\"There is no God.\\" Their deeds are loathsome and corrupt.     Don't look for signs of any intelligence in Hollywood, they don't believe in intelligent design and practice their religion full force.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|Okay, enough critical analysis people. It's Rory, and there is no bad Rory. The keyboards take me back to his earlier albums, and they were great. If he wasn't crazy about these versions, it's because his standards were always so high. If you had never heard Photo Finish, you'd be raving about every cut. I'm sitting here listening with a huge smile on my face because I've got more of my favorite guitar player to savor. I can still remember when my older brother, just home from Vietnam, put Tattoo'd Lady on the turntable for the first time. I knew that I had found the real deal. He still is, and always will be.
B004LWZWEC|4.0|Filmed in Paris in early December 1979 on the Highway To Hell tour, this is a perfect portrait of one of the greatest rock n roll bands of all time approaching the peak of their popularity. Most AC/DC fans are well aware of this concert film and hold it high as one of the coveted items in the bands catalogue. Of course the VHS version is the one everyone's had for so many years and fans have been dying for a restored DVD version. In the late 90's we had the Bonfire boxset, which contained the concert in it's entirety on CD. Not only that but the CD contained the full version of Walk All Over You which is cut short in the movie, and instead of actually seeing it, there is a strange music video type sequence of Phil Rudd in his car racing Cliff Williams in a plane in some kind of air field; as well as one of the bands encores TNT. However TNT was never included in the movie and no one seems to find it strange. Perhaps it was just never filmed, or maybe it was lost. But after all the griping the thing is finally out and it's pretty good. Awesome video and audio in all the right departments. But the extras are what's sorely lacking.    It's basically a few famous musicians like Scott Ian of Anthrax (when isnt he in something like this?!), Lemmy of Motorhead, Rick Allen of Def Leppard, The Donnas, Billy Corgan, the girl from NCIS (?!) a one off spot with a member of fellow Aussie hard rockers Rhino Bucket, metal/hard rock expert VH1 guy Eddie Trunk, and a few AC/DC afficienados. Of course they stammer on and on about how great the band is without really explaining anything and using the obvious tools of reference to describe the band (Chuck Berry riffs etc). The only ones who really say anything worth hearing is Billy Corgan and Trunk, they are real music fans here who understand the band's technique and explain it to you in a way thats interesting. Lemmy has a few cool comments but otherwise the rest are there to just rant on about how amazing rock n roll is and how great Bon was in a very uneducated way. Like they were asked to watch 5 min of the movie and then come up with something. They discuss everything from Angus' technique, Malcolm's importance to the rhythm section, Bon's death and what kinda guy he was etc. It gets slightly more interesting when they select a few songs and talk a little more indepth about them.    As a whole package its 4 stars, but the movie itself is definiatly 5. But overall, if you want the movie, if you love the concert its the package you'll wanna have. This show provides people who weren't there a glimpse of what it was like to see a band in the late 70's, before rock became corporate and acceptable, when it was still dangerous and kids who went to see them knew very little about the bands. They were just these strange magical guys who came up on stage and blew you away. That was the rebellious but slightly naive nature of going to shows in the 70's. Something that's very lost in todays times. Whether you're an AC/DC fan or just a fan of rock music, this is an essential concert movie and the short interview sections with the band provide a strange inlook without being corny. A great document of Bon Scott as one of rock's best front men. He died 2 months after it was filmed. It's a chestnut.
B0000041TD|5.0|This recording of Boheme is simply the unattainable term of reference for anybody who wants to try to sing or record it. The supercast put together here has (and will have) no equal. Mirella Freni is Mimi in every respect, her voice suits the character when a thread of singing is required or when a steel emission is needed. She is simply beyond comparison. When you hear Luciano Pavarotti at the very beginning, there you are! This is the Rodolfo you had in your mind, youthful, reckless but so captivating.His \\"Gelida manina\\" is not impeccable however (tired?) and the famous high C is started with some clear apprehension to grab it firmly immediately after. Panerai almost 50 at the time of the recording, was arriving to this Boheme after a long career where he almost squandered his magnificent voice with irresponsible repertoire choices. But surprise, surprise,(maybe Karajan had something to do with it?)here he is unbelievable, his instrument seems not to feel the wear and tear and he proves to be a perfect, ironic Marcello, his voice more beautiful than ever, and it was a privileged voice. His duets/fights with Musetta are delicious (follow the insinuating exchange \\"pittore da bottega! vipera! rospo! strega\\" the last word (strega / witch) at full volume to close the issue, not to mention the duets with Pav. Elizabeth Harwood, prematurely passsed away, leaves us the best Musetta on record, her Musetta Waltz is inimitable,managing extreme pianissimo never heard before. The rest of the cast is simply luxury for the supporting roles. Karajan had surely something to do with the singers widening their dynamic range instead of the usual forte or so. Perhaps he is not a Puccini conductor as someone says, but the thick orchestration of Puccini needs a firm hand to keep everything together and in order. Here no one beats him, his orchestra,no less than Vienna Philharmonic, \\"sings\\" together with the voices in perfect harmony. To understand this, listen to the other Boheme of those days Solti, Caballe' Domingo, leaving Caballe' Domingo aside (no match for Freni and Pav in Puccini) you will hear the orchestra more dramatic but not that polished and dynamic like the other one. Listen to the end of Musetta's Waltz where everybody goes for a fantastic choral high note. If you can help not to jump from your armchair and applaud, you will be able to listen to the dynamics Karajan manages to obtain from the orchestra full throttle, to idling for a second to full throttle again in a way that no one comes close. In conclusion without insulting other singers and serious professional who attempted to do Boheme, this is the term of reference from that time on.Period.

B002OEBMN4|2.0|For the last 25 years I've thought of myself as a Slayer fan. It's time I faced reality: what I actually am is a Reign In Blood fan.<br /><br />I've dutifully purchased everything Slayer has put out, and yet precious little of it has floated my boat. I know from reading interviews over the years that the guys in the band are genuinely puzzled and annoyed by people like me who think Reign was the pinnacle of their catalog. I suppose it's only natural... who would want to hear random strangers basically saying &#34;Hey, I think your career peaked ages ago.&#34; But they seem to honestly not understand why it stands out to us. To them it's simply an old album they did back in the '80s, nothing particularly special about it compared to the other records they put out. They've asked &#34;Why would we want to repeat it? We'd rather move forward.&#34; To which I would respond, &#34;OK, but you've basically released SIX freaking variations on Seasons In the Abyss over the last 20 years.&#34;<br /><br />I thought I was done with them after the extremely ho-hum Christ Illusion, and I was able to go almost two years without bothering with World Painted Blood. Something made me want to check it out last week (who am I kidding, it was because I was listening to Reign In Blood for the 500,000,000th time) and it's exactly what I was afraid it would be- completely indistinguishable from Christ Illusion or God Hates. Totally generic Slayer. I think I'm really done with them now. Seriously, I mean it this time. If I try to buy their next album, stop me. Don't let me do it!

030745455X|1.0|The first book of this series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very well written and had an amazing plot.  Its sequel was the complete opposite.<br /><br />First and foremost, the heroine Salander is only 4'11\\" yet manages to beat up bikers and even dig herself out of a grave AFTER BEING SHOT 3 TIMES!! If the author were to watch the video of the attempted assassination of Reagan, he would see multiple grown men incapicated by one or two .22 shots to the torso.  There is no way that this little girl could have dug herself out of a grave with three bullet wounds.  While her fighting expertise could be explained by years in a martial arts facility, it can't really be explained by working out in a gym once when she was a teenager.  This alone makes this book, which is written fairly normally, seem like a fantasy novel. Also, the author stacked way too many attributes on Salazar.  She is an expert in combat, yet gets raped by her guardian.  She somehow has the no how to steal billions from a corrupt billionaire?  Has the author ever tried to use a bank, with sums of money as large as those alleged in the book?  You would have to show ID.<br /><br />Secondly, the writing is very, very poor.  Everything is explained ad nauseum.  The laptop has a 17-inch screen, 2.2 GHZ processor, 200 GB hard drive and 1.00 mb of ram.  Wow, and the coffee, they have to drink coffee all the time.

B004VBAHG6|3.0|I'm a very long term Peter Murphy fan, but ever since Go Away White there has been a problem. Maybe its too much smoking, age, or both, but Murphy is losing the ability to hit or to hold a note. Its like hes straining and squeezing his throat all the time.    Theres creativity, and then theres musical innaccuracy. In Velocity Bird, for example, he is too high at the beginning of the slider notes.    The whole album suffers from wild straining vocal fluctuations in both tone and pitch, but the worst offender is certainly 'Never Fall Out.' This song had the writing and musical performance to be Murphy's best ballad ever. Instead, its ruined, with no beauty and smoothness to the singing at all. It burns your ears. The exact same problem plagues 'Secret Silk Society.' It could have been so atmospheric, instead its hideously crooning.    On the plus side though, I gave it 3 and not 2 stars On a few songs, despite having a couple of mistakes here and there, the performance is good enough to be able to temporarily forget the agony.     'Slowdown' is bland but relievingly well performed vocally, 'I Spit Roses' and 'Old Lady Shade' are catchy. The stand outs for me are 'Memory Go' and 'Uneven and Brittle.' There was a demo floating around of 'Uneven' about a year back, and since the demo the guitar has been tweaked and Murphy rather acceptable vocals turned up in the mix :) Some of the theatrics fit the grinding style. The lyrics almost seem about matrimonial problems, so quite personal.    For me, 'Seesaw Sway' is the only other listenable song, but in all, the album has enough good and re-listenable moments to salvage itself. So I rate it as 'OK'
B004SDSSFY|5.0|After trying several different office suites on my Samsung Galaxy Tab, I found Documents to Go to be the most straightforward and efficient to use, and the format support is by far the most accurate. Even complicated Excel sheets loaded quickly and looked exactly the same in Docs to Go as on my desktop. After deciding to purchase the full version, I uninstalled the copy I'd downloaded from the Android Market, then installed the main app + full version key *both* from the Amazon Appstore. It looks like this is where many people have problems, but for me it worked beautifully. Now I can edit docs with ease!
B004XIQDYW|5.0|To record Humbug, Arctic Monkeys headed to the California desert with a slew of incomplete song ideas and the mood to experiment a bit. This time around, the band prepared and tried to perfect their songs at home before traveling to Los Angeles to record. The result is a more immediate album, but also one that may take a few listens to fully appreciate.    The first two songs released off of the album (Brick By Brick and Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair) were quite a misdirection for fans since, besides those two and the jagged Library Pictures, the rest of Suck It And See contains very summer-friendly melodies and choruses. Some of the band's most successful previous singles were more joyful than rocky, and this time around Alex Turner and company seemed to make it a point to perfect that type of sound.    Black Treacle, Reckless Serenade, title track Suck It And See, and closer That's Where You're Wrong will likely hook you quicker than anything they've recorded since Flourescent Adolescent. The aforementioned \\"heavier\\" songs (though they still roll out at a pace much slower than the band's older material) work well on the album and provide necessary tempo changes.    Track-for-track, this is likely the Arctic Monkeys' best album to date, providing twelve songs that range from fun to spectacular, and absolutely no filler. The only complaint I have is the fact that I like the Submarine OST recording of Piledriver Waltz a bit more than this album version, but it's still very good in its own right. While listening to Suck It And See, you'll likely realize that this is a band that is fine-tuning its skill set and using all of the tricks they've learned so far to create some wonderful music. Can't wait to see where they go next.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|I have no problem with bands experimenting.  Many musicians have delved into styles of music that are far from their main projects.  However, when a band attempts to call a departure like this by their original brand, it's tantamount to bait & switch.    The problem with \\"I\\" isn't that the band decided to go off in a different direction, or that they might be tiring of playing the same kind of music they've always played.  No, the problem is that the experimentation itself is lackluster and generic, leaving precious little \\"meat\\" to carry the rest of the effort forward.  Worse yet, the remaining Death Metal songs on the album are standard fare, lacking in imagination.    Instead of a boundary-pushing album that sounds fresh and innovative, we're left with a slab of goo that goes nowhere and offers nothing of consequence:  nothing on either side of the equation that stands out as particularly creative or interesting.    The final insult to fans of Morbid Angel is that the band has chosen to market this effort under their original brand, fully knowing that their longtime fans were hoping for something different.    I'm sure Trey, David, and Company can buckle down and write a comeback slab of excellent Death Metal to at least partially recover from this.  One can only hope they do.  If not, then I suggest they announce the end of Morbid Angel.  Because I'm not sure what to call their new project -- I just know it shouldn't be called Morbid Angel.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|If you don't have this album, GET IT.  Not a bad song out of the bunch - though my favorite is Love for Sale - every song is a gem.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I really like this product and it has worked out great so far.  It does a good job of protecting the iphone from small drops.  As long as you dont drop it screen first it will do a good job of protecting your iphone.  The corners are really sturdy and protect the case better than the rubber cases that I have previously used and seen.  It is also a great price and I would highly recommend this case.  The only reason for four instead of five stars is that the case shows alot of fingerprints but other than that no real problems.
B00003CXIY|5.0|his film holds fond memories for me, as I saw it on the day I left college.     The film is still hilarious and has lost none of its edge, and I still think its a lot funnier than the american pie movies, which still leaves me wondering why they never made a sequel to road trip.     Make sure you watch the out takes during the end credits - they contain some moments that are funnier than those in the completed film.
1444710338|2.0|I found the book to be long and drawn out. I just want to get to the diet for Pete's sake! The book was very educational however, I just need to know what to do and the plan. One part says eat 1 slice of this and 1 of that. Next it says to eat all I want from that plan! I am so confused. I saw this on the Dr. Oz show and felt it was an easy diet so I wanted to try it. I feel like I have to read the whole book to even get started. I have very little time for that!
B0000A02TZ|3.0|Yes, they removed all the original, and classic, music from the film. When I looked it up on the internet - it happened for copyright reasons apparently.     Although the film is still great, the lack of hit music from that period really robs the movie of its charm. This was always a madcap comedy, but it is also a sweet and touching film. The characters are such great fun and it is still sad to see John Belushi at the height of his comedy powers when he was just making his big break.     A classic, that has been tragically mauled for the DVD release.
B004ZZITEU|1.0|I could not believe my ears upon hearing this, how could the mighty Morbid Angel veer so far off the course? I had heard of the industrial leanings, and was optimistic they could incorporate that element ala Anaal Nathrakh, Thorns, and maintain their identity, heaviness, and dark vibe, but they absolutely butchered it. Dumb, \\"frat-boy\\" lyrics (Radikult), and horrible techno-metal that sounds like bad Powerman 5000 (I've heard many others make the same comparison, but if you played Radikult or Are you Morbid? without telling me who it was, I would have said Powerman 5K). This just sound like a bad new nu-metal band, not one of the most legendary death metal bands in existence. Again, I have absolutely no problem with expanding your sound and introducing new elements, but this is just so poorly done and makes such an intense, technically proficient group of musicians sound like amateurs. I won't even delve into the lyrics, I just can't fathom or wrap my head around that one. I will continue to listen to the classics (Blessed, Domination), and hope one day the true Morbid Angel re-emerges and makes up for this abomination, but they have a monumental task ahead of them to redeem themselves for this travesty.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I was a little put off by the cover of the DVD, but once I started watching this film I was completely hooked.     This is one of the funniest comedies I have seen in a long time, and the actors are all brilliant in it - in terms of performances you cannot fault this film.     What I also liked is the fact that the characters are very well developed, and you really do care what happens to them. I was really worried when Kick Ass was captured.     This film is truly brilliant, you have to see it.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|This movie is one of the best and imaginative that has been made in years, very truthful about the environment in victorian England.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|Overall the book was a delightful and eye opening read into a world that seems to be discussed very little, even more interesting is the voice in which this story is spoken. Good book for anyone looking for an inspirational and realistic read about the variety of difficult decisions and experiences that seem to invade our lives.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game itself is great but it really needs an update to work better with Android tablets. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and the game has major slowdown issues. It is also not very stable. There are graphical glitches around text sometimes and it has crashed a few times. I had to force quit the game and restart it for it to work properly. The graphics are also not optimized for these higher resolution displays. It looks great on my phone but not very good on my tab. Hope Popcap issues an update with high-res graphics and a fix for the slowdown/glitches.
B003MX5P20|4.0|i think that amazon is  very helpful in finding the right music, and the quality of this cd is great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great book. Some others I love for comparison (although they are very different in terms of content): The Help, Kite Runner (after first 20 pages!), The Blue Bistro, Three Cups of Tea, A Thousand Splendid Suns, Room, all the silly Something Borrowed, etc books, some of the Shopaholic books, Memoirs of a Geisha.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|How many times can Dustin Hoffman turn in incredible performances and each totally unique and different from the other. While most actors do not stretch much beyond what they usually play (Sylvester Stallone), Dustin continually re-invents himself and each time give a world class performance. The movie is just great but even if it were not, seeing Dustin in yet another incredible performance is worth it. I put this on my list of 100 Greatest Movies You Have Never Seen.
159562015X|1.0|The idea and book are great except for the fact that they only way to take the online test is to buy a new book. This isn't mentioned anywhere on this site. The access code required to take the test is in the book can only be used once.    I bought a used copy and so far found that seem to have a natural talent for getting ripped off.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|Of course by now, everyone knows what a fantastic movie Iron Man is.  It's even more enjoyable on blu-ray where every scene jumps out at you.  I only wish the 5.1 would have sounded a little crisper on my home theatre system, but it's a small thing to comment about.  To me, it's still the best Marvel movie and I loved Thor and X-Men First Class.  Something unique about Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal - he is Tony Stark.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|We love this GAME and play it together daily.  It plays wonderful on my HTC THUNDERBOLT.  Was able to unlock the next level and this too.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Forget the labels that this album and band espouses.  I have heard those who would claim this to be metalcore, deathcore, death metal etc etc.  They all fail miserably to classify this band because they fail to understand what the bands intentions are.  They are clearly paying perpetual homage to Testament, Megadeth, Slayer and other various thrash bands in the guitar riffing department.  The guitar tone is not overprocessed, it is very clean, and is light on the distortion.  Very atonal and often very creative.  Those riffs in \\"11th Hour\\" are slick, they are precise, and they are not melodic.  The vocals are strained yet clear.  Blythe's vocal style is unique and refreshing.  He lacks power but has droves of commitment, and his intensity remains constant.  Devin Townsend was able to produce this album in such a way that it helped define the Lamb of God sound.  Their albums since have always sounded like this one, despite their varying qualities in the production department since.  \\"Vigil\\" is a particular highlight for it's doom-based riff and echo-y and introspective guitar lines sprinkled throughout.  The title track \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" is a quick and boot to the throat type of song.  Forget the people who claim this to be some sort of pop music sensation, forget the people who claim this is trendy garbage.  Those same weak fools likely harbor this album in their collection.
0312600844|5.0|It is funny to me how just a few days ago I was talking with a good friend about having a strong dislike of Patty but by the end of the book I was really hoping her and Walter would work things out. I actually sighed when he threw her manuscript in the file cabinet and smiled when he sees her on the front step. Though I am not a 'hollywood ending' type of person at all I felt the characters were well done and so that closure made sense in the overall tragic setting of the book. There is something about seeing things falls apart and drift away through time or to come together again through varying perspectives that made it seem more accurate to life.    The book obviously covers much more than their time together and apart but I think the illustration is apt regarding other plots of the book. Each main character has a major flaw in themselves but there is so much more to them that makes them agreeable to me as a reader.     Definitely one of those book you race through because you cannot put down but as soon as you are nearing the end you want to slow down to make it last and then once you finish are feeling nostalgic about when you started. I actually read the last ~140 pages tonight but had set it down with ~20 pages left to let it soak in and last.    Then again, I am from Minneapolis. So maybe it is just the kind bias towards a book with so many references to familiar locations...
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is hands down the greatest album ever made. There is nothing about this album I can write that hasn't already been written, so I won't try. Yet, I will write that Stevie was at his best when making this album and it's hard to have a favorite song when they are all so beautiful.    This is one album that should be in everyone's collection.
1400052181|2.0|The first half was an interesting and educational narrative on the one woman's unplanned involvement in some of the greatest scientific discoveries of the decade. The first half of Skloot's work was compelling and drew me in completely.  But about halfway through this book, the story drifted into a contrived and perhaps, irrelevant history of the Lacks family that created neither sympathy nor interest. While we were riveted and sympathetic to Henrietta's plight, I was not so to the family members stories.  What could have been condensed into a sharply writted magazine article seemed to meander into a story of family dysfunction that seems disassociated with the story of Henrietta. Not my cup of tea.
B000H305U0|5.0|If Prince still made great music (he doesn't, last good album was 20 years ago), he would have made this. This album from the song writing, to the production, to the vocals has Prince written all over it. This album is very mature and sexy and not what you would expect from a former Disney kid.<br /><br />The album has two main topics: Love and Sex. With one very good revenge song, ''What Goes Around'' which is hands down one of the best songs he's ever written and it's easy to tell that this was about a certain ex-girlfriend *cough Britney *cough who was wasn't doing so well after their break up. Other stand out tracks are Futuresex/Lovesounds, Sexy Ladies, and Damn Girl. None of which were singles but should have been<br /><br />Overall, this is a 5 star album and I hope one day he can top it
0307346617|4.0|This book was compared to the \\"War of the Worlds\\" radio broadcast. Brooks did not miss that mark. I enjoyed the Handbook for Survival, shared my copy with several people as well as bought additional copies for friends. All I shared it with found it an entertaining, humorous book.<br /><br />The manner in which WWZ unfolds makes it difficult to set it down. It is written from the position of one who interviews human survivors after a war against zombies. The survivors are interviewed from different regions of the world as well as from different positions in life. The various perspectives contributes greatly to the plot. The manner in which many survivors were able to ignore what became an eventual fight for the survival of our species was frightening. Some were more concerned about the details in their daily life while, at least one, saw this event as a means for capital gain.<br /><br />I enjoyed and strongly recommend this book. A sequel would be interesting.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I have to admit, I'm not a big Alicia Keys fan. Didn't get they hype about her or her first album. But that changed when she dropped this clssic. ''The Diary'' is hands down A.Keys best work to date and to be honest I doubt she'll ever top it.<br /><br />The Pros<br /><br />A.Keys is a great song writer and shines on tracks like ''So Simple'' and ''Karma''. I love the beats and there my favorite songs on the album. I also love ''Slow Down'', ''Diary'', and ''Nobody Not Really''. Those are some really nice love songs with soft beats. It's ''make-love'' type of music. Other fun tracks are ''Samsonite Man'', Wake-Up'', and ''Dragon Days'' and the interlude ''Feeling u, Feeling Me'' is pure soft sex.<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />A.Keys voice ruins some songs. She sings songs to big for her voice sometimes. Tracks like ''If I Ain't Got You'' and '' You Don't Know My Name'' are good songs but A.Keys was yelling and her voice was breaking at times. She just didn't pull those songs off well. I've seen covers on Youtube that sound better.<br /><br />Overall, A.Keys brought the fire on this album. I got this album on tape first but since no one even buys or sales tapes anymore, I spent the 13.99 and just got the damn cd and I'm happy I did
B004IQMXD4|5.0|There's something for everyone on this album, there's great variety.  From the haunting lyrics and melody of \\"For What It's Worth\\" to the rockin' \\"Ghosts are Gone\\" Stevie nails this one.  Dave Stewart did a fantastic job of putting this album together.  I love it's dramatic, sweeping style.  Great romantic album.  You can tell Stevie is back on top of her game, clean, and happy.  I personally love \\"Soldier's Angel\\" with Lindsey Buckingham.  His vocals add a raw edge to her song in a way that only he can do it.
B004LFO0FG|5.0|LOVE this CD.  One of Britney's best.  My 4 year old son and I listen to it in the car ALL the time :)
B000V07IVS|5.0|If you are considering getting this box set, consider no more--it's fantastic.  Nothing needs to be said about the quality of Mravinsky's musicianship--he is easily one of the 10 greatest conductors of the 20th century.  The Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky symphonies (which comprise nearly half of this set) are authoritative, exciting, and tremendously enjoyable.  While Mravinsky may have individual performances of these symphonies that are even better than what's here, the overall level is at a high quality and no apologies need be made for any of them (that said, I am extremely partial to Mravinsky's DG STEREO (not the earlier mono) recordings of the Tchaikovsky symphonies from 1960--those are unsurpassable and can only be considered THE definitive performances of Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies).  And the sound is fine--which is no small victory when it comes to Mravinsky live recordings, many of which were recorded by some of the most incompetent recording engineers known to mankind, a.k.a. Melodiya.<br /><br />The surprises are the Beethoven symphonies.  The performance of the 5th absolutely knocked my socks off--not only is it a GREAT performance, but I think it could possibly be a candidate for being the GREATEST performance that these ears have heard (my highest standards of comparison are Carlos Kleiber's VPO performance, Erich Kleiber's Concertgebouw performance, and a Furtwangler performance from EMI).  The 7th is an excellent, vigorous performance.  The first movement reminds me of Klemperer's approach to the symphony: grand, slow, monolithic.  The 2nd movement is grave and beautiful, and the last two movements take off as they should.  It's a fine performance.  I haven't listened to the 6th just yet.<br /><br />As for the Wagner...well, it's enjoyable because it's great music, and it's worth hearing, but no one will confuse these performances with being \\"traditional.\\"  There is definitely a \\"Russian character\\" to these performances (hard to describe in10 words or less, but easy to recognize when you hear it) that sounds....well, foreign--at times I wondered if Tchaikovsky did some ghost-writing for Wagner.  So because the Wagner selections are so different from what we're used to hearing, they are worth hearing.  But more than once?  Hmmm....I think I'll stick with Klemperer, Karajan, and Furtwangler.  It reminds me of a concert I heard in which Tchaikovsky's 6th was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi.  After the performance was over, I turned to my companion, and said, \\"Well, what did you think of that?\\"  And he gave the perfect response:  \\"That's why Germans shouldn't be conducting Russian music.\\"
0670022411|5.0|Be aware that this book is the FIRST in a series of THREE.  Don't be off-put by that because by the time you finish this tome you will be anxious for more.  Witches, Demons and Vampires - OH MY!!  I loved the title but the first bit of the book was \\"clinical and college reading\\" oriented.  I pushed through and BOY am I glad I did.  Dispel your \\"warm blood\\" ideas and go with the flow.  You will experience some Harry Potter, some Diana Gabaldon, a lot of magic and one great story that ends far too soon.  A great read, a better author and I am eager for the next book - sadly not until next year.  I'll wait.  Too good to miss.  Great job Ms. Harkness!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this game for the ipod and it seems to be a perfect port of the iphone/ipod version. It does run a little bit slower but it is a very fun game and this should cause you concern. Great game, must buy!
0793563836|4.0|First off, I have to say that I bought this because Ed Friedland wrote it.  I am like most bass players, mostly an ear player and also a guitar player, as well as other instruments.  I decided to get this method to bone up on my bass playing.  The music examples are realistic bass parts as opposed to archaic melodies provided by the Mel Bay version.  Let's face it, we're learning to play bass not a four-sting low register guitar.  It would be better if the music examples were from actual songs, but you can also buy the supplementary song books that go with it.
0452289963|2.0|This item arrived in the time frame alloted. However, after going through the book I noticed that there were several chapters missing while having several repeated. The book was defective. This is the second time I have ordered something from here and there was a problem with missing chaptrs and chapters being repeated. It is making me cautious in ordering from here in the future.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I don't know what to say. I would never have read any war story books if my brother inlaw hadnt suggested it. He had me look into it so I had the free sample delivered. It did seem at first, that it was going to be boring, but I just knew by some of the little remarks that it was going to get intense. This book had me laughing and crying (then really crying hard one day when my kindle froze up and wouldn't come on). Mostly though, it made me realize just how proud I am to live in America to have such men as Marcus and Mikey and Danny and Axel protecting me and my family. There are no words to describe how much you guys mean to me. This also goes out to your families as they had to be as brave as them to let them go. I couldn't deal with the thought of any of my children doing what these guys do. Great Book!!! It should be placed in every classroom in America!!!!!!
1603420398|5.0|I had never crocheted a motif before getting this book and I love it. There is every possible shape and pattern you might need in this book and relatively easy instructions...sometimes they get a bit confusing but it's easy to figure out once you try them. They are beautiful and it's inspiring since it doesn't take long to make a motif, and yet there is so much you can do with them. Wonderful book! Great to have as something to refer back to at any time.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. I read it as a fanfic as well. I loved it so much I downloaded it on my Kindle and read it again. I am in love with all the characters. I love the complexity of it. I hope E.L. James decides to continue to write about 50 for years to come!
0679805273|5.0|i ordered three of these books and got an excellent deal through the super saver shipping. they came fast and in perfect condition. have already used two for graduation gifts. i'm gonna stock up on these books!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|The one scene where Po and his Master fight over the dumpling -- by itself, this makes the movie worth the price of admission. I'm not a Jack Black fan, but I gotta admire his spot-on impression of a fanboy. (\\"Whoahhh!\\") His voice work is all the more amazing when you leave the room and listen to it from the kitchen, and you hear the sheer variety of grunts, screams, and sighs he had to come up with -- all without any idea of how the sparring scenes would look. In animated film production, the voices are recorded first, and the animators \\"draw\\" to match them. This means that Jack (and all the actors) had to work from pure imagination. One wonders how many takes he had to do, until the sound engineers got enough different exclamations from him that they could place them wherever needed. My daughter LOVES this movie. A brilliant send-up of the Chinese martial-arts genre, without in any way being condescending.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app shows graphs of the networks in my neighborhood, what channels they are on and even suggests alternate channels to increase my network's reliability, no more guessing.    You would think tools like this would be built into the router's software
0743277457|4.0|Really interesting book.  Fast-paced, intelligent.  The author tried to make the ideas widely applicable, but some of the book really only applies to competition.  Still, many of his ideas apply to everyone, and it gave me a lot of food for thought (It is one of those books you find yourself thinking about weeks and even months later).
B004GYY714|2.0|Doesn't integrate well with Android like competitors. For example, service rarely exits cleanly, doesn't mute when voice search activated (theres an intent for it), and no  media controls (bluetooth pause).
B003ELOQD4|1.0|That's how I feel about this Blu Ray Concert. I saw the concert live in YouTube and I enjoyed so much that when I saw it for purchase in blu ray I jump right away. What a waste! They change everything! Don't even open the concert with the right song. The filming is obscure and cameras jump like a kangaroo. Is very hard to watch. Also the sound is not great. I like the concert even when they do not sing most of their hits songs but the filming sincerly sucks!
B000F8O35U|3.0|It was a good price, but the dvds were loose inside the package and got scratched.  The dvd was closed and wrapped, but it rattled.  When I opened it up, both discs were loose.
B0054EZ6JM|5.0|My DVR blew me off on this on Saturday.  I made it all the way to Wednesday before I thought that $2.99 was an acceptable price and paid up.  I suppose I'd change that if I could.  Unbelievable ep.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for awhile now and have built high expectations in that time. Luckily, this movie meets those high expectations. This is one movie you should not miss. This movie will surely draw comparisons to ET and other movies but this movie can stand by itself. This movie is for a new generation so the thinking will be different. The acting in this movie is very good. The actors portray their characters perfectly and it looks as if all the actors are completely comfortable in their roles. I wish the acting from the children was a little better but it is passable. It is great to see how they view the world and comprehend all of the events. The directing from J.J. Abrams is great. He makes the movie flow nicely and doesn't rush any parts. Some scenes may be a little overplayed but it doesn't take away from the film. The story is not predictable with the exception of the ending. The story does include a few cliches. The story is, overall, well-written. The dialogue is also well-written. It does not feel like it was written by a 13 year old unlike some other movies. The action is great and well-directed. The action scenes are intense and the derailing train scene is great! The film has a nice pace to it so that it doesn't feel rushed or too slow. One problem I have with the movie is the ending. It is not very good and a little cheesy. Another thing is that I would love to know more about some characters. It would've helped the movie and I feel like we don't know enough about Alice's father. Overall, I recommend that you see this film and form your own opinion. Just make sure that you do not know too much before going in. Super 8 is a great summmer flick with a good story. The film has plenty of good moments that make this one you will not soon forget!
B0037QGS0A|2.0|OK, this apparently is an erotic thriller. Well, let's start with the eroticism part. Amanda Seyfried--very cute. Julianne Moore--uh, no. Liam Neeson--uh, double no.<br /><br />A thriller where Liam Neeson does not get angry and chase down bad guys. Remind me why he's in this.<br /><br />Also, the dialogue is beyond ridiculous. The scene where Seyfried (who is playing a prostitute) describes a sexual encounter with Neeson's character is beyond classic. It's as if the scriptwriter, Erin Cressida Wilson (because three names are better than two!) was afraid of actually saying any medical, let alone slang, terms for the actual body parts used to have sex. There's no need to bleep anything for any Christian market they want to reach with this movie, to put it mildly. It's about as erotic as shopping for chairs.<br /><br />The DVD \\"making of\\" extra is worth watching to see how pretentious the producers, director and scriptwriter are about this project and the Torontonianess just oozes out. Look, we get it, Torontonians think their city is important being the financial hub of Canada, but people like yourselves once you open your mouths make the rest of us Canadians laugh at your own inflated sense of self.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, the movie is mainly shot in the winter probably because of its \\"glacial\\" pace. The entire first hour makes watching yacht racing on TV look like the Stanley Cup playoffs. Of course, the epilogue (metaphor alert!) is in the bright sunshine of spring.<br /><br />Now SPOILER ALERT, only Atom (Ant?) Egoyan could actually think a movie where a woman hires a prostitute to seduce her husband only to have her end up doing the horizontal mambo with said pro instead...and then have the pro sleep with the mom's son in the parents' bed, fall through a window and die...and the dysfunctional family is all happy at movie's end would make for a plausible story. I kid you not. This is the story. It's hilariously over-the-top dumb.<br /><br />I'll also mention that Moore is a gynecologist (of course, she is as we're dealing with stunted adults who green-lit this script), Neeson a university prof and their confused (probably by this story) son a classical music prodigy.<br /><br />Even more hilarious is Seyfried, as a \\"high-priced\\" prostitute who frequents high-end hotels with her clients and yet rides a bicycle in the winter in Toronto...and not in any sort of winter cycling gear but in a dress and stockings with high heels on. Hey, everyone does in T.O. when it's 15 below, don't they?<br /><br />It's as if a bunch of Hollywood North types who like softcore porn but want to be \\"artistes\\" came up with their idea of what would make for an edgy and sexy thriller. Sorry, it didn't work. It comes across as complete pretentious nonsense.<br /><br />Oh, and Ivan \\"Ghostbusters\\" Reitman is part of the producing team. Your large set of teeth should be embarrassed to be seen in the DVD extras. Stick to comedy, Ivan.<br /><br />The only person who comes out of this mess intact is Amanda Seyfried whose lips are most definitely erotic and whose giant wide-open eyeballs seem like she's permanently on some thrill ride the rest of us are unaware of. I think mainly she was probably in shock she signed up for this mess.e dealing with stunted adults who green-lit this script), Neeson a university prof and their confused (probably by this story) son a classical music prodigy.

B004RQVVGU|5.0|Some years ago I ripped  this album fron a friend's borrowed CD and when i lintened this CD I will shocked because this CD sounded far better than the MP3 files.    And the live CD was good enough for its very own nature.I founded this bonus recording a good idea because it allow me to \\"know\\" a snapshot how was the previous Ozzy's CD tour (Blizzard of Ozz).    I'am from Chile and I very happy with tis buy. The last i want tosay is, please, Forgive me Englsih.    This 2-CD set earned the five stars of it's own.

B004VFYOA2|4.0|Kudos to David Coverdale for finally releasing an album that long-time fans have been requesting for years.  I'm surprised this was released in such close proximity to Forevermore, but I'm not complaining!<br /><br />As one previous reviewer wrote, the audio here is fantastic, and not surprisingly, the band's performance is strong.  How could it not be, with Steve Vai, Adrian Vandenburg, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge?<br /><br />I don't have a problem withe the \\"bootleg quality\\" of the video.  It's actually interesting to see something that's not HD, but I do have one complaint about the video here.  I don't like the fact that 99% of the shots are individual close-ups of each band member and very, very rarely do you see a wide shot of the whole stage.  So it's a close-up of Vai, then a close-up of Vandenburg, then Aldridge...but never the whole stage.<br /><br />But hey, I'm just glad to finally have a copy of this great show on cd and dvd.  At the end of the day, that's pretty cool.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This is a great book - insightful while being practical and directly usable.  Helpful in business, but not 50% fluff like most books.    It literally kept me up all night thinking after I read it (admittedly, I was on an overnight flight at the time).    The insight that really stuck with me was focusing on what's working, rather than what's not, when trying to change, and that big problems are seldom the right place to start when trying to bring about positive change.
B001HN6918|4.0|I was a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda so I was really looking forward to this. However, I did not like it as much as the first one. In Kung Fu Panda 2, we follow Poe as he and the furious five try to stop Lord Shen from taking over China. Not only do they have to stop Shen but they have to destroy a weapon that can destroy them no matter how talented they are with Kung Fu. The story was very predictable and included many cliches. There was not as many jokes and those that were there were not very funny. The Kung Fu and fighting was excellent but that cannot make a movie. I didn't really care about the characters. I only cared for Poe and the Big Rhino Guy with the hammer. I still recommend going to see this movie because you should form your own opinion. I think your younger kids will enjoy this movie but your older ones will not. The animations on this movie are just fantastic. The animations are just so smooth and crisip. It is amazing how far anamation has come. The voice acting is great and this movie has a lot of big name actors doing the voices. I dodn't want to spoil anything so all I will say is that they leave it open for a third installment. The next movie looks very interesting. Overall, I thought it was a decent movie that everyone should see and form their own opinion. I am looking forward to the third movie if they make one and I hope it is better than this one.

B00003CWOL|5.0|My husband is 65 years old and this low budget irreverent campy movie has been a longtime favorite of his. With stars like Matt Damon, Chris Rock and Silent Bob (my hubbys's fav) it proves that if you have a good cast you dont need to spend alot of money to put out a good film. The price was good and it arrived 2 days after I placed the order with Amazon Prime.
B001AQT11M|5.0|i grew up with this movie so it was only natural that I would want my kids to enjoy it as well.  I love the price I payed when everyone else was charging 30.00 I was able to find this gem for less than 15.00.  The video quality is great and as anything should last for years to come if treated right.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Maybe it's just a sign of the times or what,but I just don't find such a film even remotely acceptable. A bunch of soldiers go around horribly killing and torturing German soldiers and it's supposed to be mad-cap funny and still somehow \\"deeply profound\\"? Could such a film be made today in,say,Germany? A movie of a group of German soldiers going around hilariously killing and torturing American GI's? Would it have won awards? An Oscar? Or maybe a film of VietCong comics running around carving up American's foreheads with knives and splattering their skulls with baseball bats? Funny award winning stuff,for sure. And,before you trot out the old \\"It was War! They Did do that stuff! It's only right that we like doing it back to Them!\\" argument,yes-terrible things happen in wartime-I Know. But to make mockery of things like this is terrible regardless. No one would dream of making a film about the hilarity of living in Andersonville Prison or some other hellish prison during the Civil War. How about a righteous comedy about Auschwitz? This movie is beyond tact and taste. It's just Wrong.
1591841666|5.0|Seth Godin is telling you \\"things\\" you already know (or should), but he also calls you out for compromising on those \\"things\\" daily.

B004K4AVAG|1.0|What began as a failed military project, Weyland-Yutani Corporation's LGG (or \\"Lady GaGa\\" as it is called) \\"Scorched Earth\\" weapons platform became one of the company's big sellers at the 2011 International Cybernetics Convention (ICC) this past month.     How did Andrew Weyland turn this multi-billion dollar debacle into a hot seller? I had an opportunity to ask Mr. Weyland during the convention: \\"After the infamous 'meat-suit' disaster (The Mark 9 LGG malfunctioned during a routine systems test - deafening 10 technicians, killing three and covering itself with their remains), we thought that it was a total wash. But we had some very brilliant people work on a new, more powerful sound generating platform, a better targeting system and a more radical bio-covering. We then re-packaged the Mark 10, aiming at a younger, less sophisticated market and priced it to move.\\"    And \\"move\\" it did. Sales for the Mark 10 Ga-Ga have soared. Recent tests continue to be very promising. Ga-Ga's Nagouchi MX34 sound generation system combined with the standard auto-tune hardware can cut through a three inch block of steel in less than 3 seconds! Surprisingly, playback of the sound is almost as effective; causing small animals to literally explode. Also, the bio-covering alone is enough to break the morale of an attacking force, truly frightening.    Although some critics have called the Mark 10 LGG a \\"cheap, tawdry, pointless and lacking any real value\\" and \\"the ugliest sounding thing around\\", sales continue to be very good for this item. But Weyland-Yutani is not content to rest on their laurels. Their new press release indicates that the LGG Mark 11 will be debuting sometime next year. There seems to be no stopping this sales juggernaut.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  It was a fair read, but ultimately unsatisfying.  I found the first third a bit slow to get into, the middle was pretty good, then it started to drag again, and finally ended before it was done.  I can only assume/hope that a sequel is planned.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: some of my comments below give away aspects of the story!<br /><br />On the plus side, I was enchanted by the elements of magic and a house with a mind of its own!  The underlying themes of racial equality, the strong protecting the weak, and the underdog challenging an unjust authority all resonated with me.  While the idea of a romance between a vampire and a mortal holds no particular appeal for me, I do like idea of the robust history that a 1,500 y.o. being brings to a romantic relationship with a mortal.  Think of the stories he could tell and the things he has seen!<br /><br />The relationship between Matthew and Diana was less of an equal partnership than I would expect.  I fully appreciate the old-school chivalry that he shows her (that's how I was raised), but her allegedly powerful magic was built up the entire story, then never realized.  To me her magic is what makes her Matthew's equal and a true partner.  Because she never does realize her magical potential, the story fizzles.  At least for me.<br /><br />If there is a satisfying sequel that actually finishes the story, the two books could be a great story.  Satisfying for me will mean that Diana realizes her potential, becomes an incredibly powerful witch and, partnered with Matthew, changes the world for all the races.  Yes, a good, old-fashioned happy ending is what I hope for.  Didn't quite get there with this book.

B0000TG9E2|2.0|This is perhaps my least favorite of the classic Disney animation features... It's a cluttered muddle that simply does not capture the essence of the Lewis Carroll books, mainly because Carroll's subtle humor is buried under an avalanche of Disney kitsch, but also because Disney failed to capture the willful, prickly spirit of the Alice character... or indeed, to give her any personality at all.       The real problem isn't that this adaptation dilutes or distorts the original story, it's that it just isn't a very good film -- the script is disjointed and confusing and the animation follows suit.  Obviously, it being a Disney film, there are millions of people who love it, so take what I say with a grain of salt... just look at the hundreds of \\"five star\\" reviews that surround mine.  But I honestly can't recommend this one. I think it's a dud.  (Axton)
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I have seen all 8 seasons and wish a 9th. season will come soon, because the end of the 8th. left me on a limbo of what is going to happen to Jack Bauer or C.T.U.
B004NDVJJG|5.0|Pianist Marcin Wasiklewski and coconspirators bassist Slawomir Kurkiewicz and drummer Michal Miskiewicz show that the accolades flowing their way are deserved as they think and play fresh and nuanced jazz. The music flows as smoothly as water courses through well-worn stone channels, yet has enough mystery and magic to keep the listener anticipating and engaged.<br /><br />I cannot speak with any eloquence or knowledge about their technique or whether they are following with or breaking from any sort of tradition here. So I take the title \\"Faithful\\" to related to one's own inner compass and directions (\\"to thine own self be true\\"), and this trio does not waiver in seeking to forge its own identity among the multiple excellent piano-bass-drums trios out there not by pushing the boundaries of their instruments but rather by honing and coaxing them.<br /><br />As with most music, I find certain settings embellish the experience (or is it the other way around?), and \\"Faithful\\" works well as the soundtrack for an early summer evening spent reflecting and watching fireflies and I suspect will also serve the same purpose for the first fires of autumn.
B003EV6DBW|2.0|The discs in this set will not play right on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. The sound cuts out constantly and you have to keep hitting pause then play to hear a few more seconds of audio before it happens again. I sent back the set and got a replacement, but the new ones did the same thing. I took my Blu Ray player back and got a different model, but the problem was even worse! I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of Season 5 instead.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|While I enjoyed the video series \\"the pacific\\", it had good military action based on the marines 1st division,it did not include much from the book it was taken from.  As usual the book was much better, but that is usually the case.
B00417HV14|5.0|Who is this guy? I could not sleep one night in early April 011 flipping through the channels to Palladia. I could not turn the volume up much,my wife was sleeping.Seeing two drummers and this guy in sun glasses,dressed nice, playing a guitar and singing like I have not seen for a long time.I wrote his name down and in the next day or two went to Amazon and could not belive all of the 4-5 star ratings on all of the CD's and DVD's.I think then I ordered a couple of his older CD's first. Buy the time they came,I found his web site and of course some videos.Listened to CD's and buy that time I had ordered this DVD.I grew up in the 60's and was exposed to [of course] the Beatles at age 12.My oldest brother collected records from mid 50's and 60's. From the Beatles, the British Invasion,Black Sabbath,Led Zeppelin, Santana,Ozzy Osbourne and other super groups in the early 70's and beyond,and of course SRV, I have a wide musicial appetite for true talent.I will also throw in Hank Williams and Jr, Buddy Holly and several others of the late 50's.The first night my wife and I were going to watch the DVD,she says \\"I do not like that kind of music\\" {the blues}. Well, after she wanted to watch it the next night,she said \\"I have never seen anyone play a guitar like that\\".Now,after understanding more of the lyrics this is all she wants to listen to or watch on DVD. Joe Bonamassa is a true talent and I get excited listening to and telling other people about his music and DVD's.I guess I too have also been under a rock the past few years. Please note this DVD will spoil you because Joe's vocals and band are at the top,giving 125%.A lot of reveiws about the Joe's live performances being better that the stuido recordings? I may agree. Maybe, Joe is still being that 'LITTLE HAM' he refers to at his first performance with B.B.King.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I know that there are lots of people that really enjoyed this movie, and I am not knocking them for it.  Many will agree with me and many won't. I really looked forward to seeing this movie.  I was under the impression that it was about two girls competing for the same part and doing whatever it takes to get it. Actually, quite a few people I spoke to thought that. So I rented it.  Let me just say that for those of you that are considering watching it, be warned.  If you are into graphic sex scenes every five minutes, then this is your movie.  The main character Nina is a mentally ill ballerina that seems to completely loose it upon getting this role that in real life she would never even be considered for.  I found myself more confused more than anything. I do think that it had the making of a very good story, but then someone took it in a whole other direction.  Natalie Portman was good, but I found her character to be very annoying at times.  Mila Kunis was awesome and very likable.  I felt that the sex scenes were very over the top for this particular movie.  The scenes left nothing to the imagination and were unnecessary.  The part of Tomas, the instructor, although very well played, was creepy.  The way he talked to Nina, and his advances on her were out of line. But his telling her to go home and touch herself was ridiculous.  Then she does it, not realizing that her mother was in the room and had fallen asleep, while watching her sleep all night. Her mother seems aware of her mental illness, but doesn't seem to do anything about it except cut her nails so she doesn't scratch herself, paint creepy portraits of her and watch her sleep. It seems that the illness goes all the way back to her childhood, but her mother just hovers and watches her every move as if she is eight years old.  Not twenty eight.  It struck me as odd that no one around her noticed her odd behavior.  In the end I was left wondering what was real and what wasn't.  I like movies that make you think.  But this one left me asking \\"huh?\\"   I felt that they could have clarified a lot of things. I am not a prude.  But I felt that this movie should have gotten an NC-17 rating.  The reason being that many people have seen or are going to see this movie not expecting the scenes to be so explicit.  If this had been Sex And The City, it wouldn't have bothered me, because the movie is all about that.  Actually Sex and the City was pretty tame compared to this.

I haven't been able to find anything on the internet about this problem happening to anyone else, but since I tried replacements of the discs and the player I seriously doubt it's just me. If you buy these, don't just let them sit on the shelf for a while; try them out first.
0316098329|4.0|***SPOILERS***    I liked this book a lot, mainly because it was narrated by Jack, the five-year-old kid trapped with his Ma in a sound-proof cell. Many people seem to be disappointed by the choice of narrator, which leaves many questions open and is sometimes frustrating in terms of language. Not me, I think that Jack's innocence is refreshing considering the horrible context in which the story happens. Sure, the kid appears to be too developed sometimes, only to look too slow a moment later, but we shouldn't measure Jack against the average child standard. We have to keep in mind he hasn't had any human interactions besides Ma. I think the negative reviews are focusing too much on this. The truth is that we don't know how a child would develop under those circumstances and Jack is the author's guess, which is as valid as anyone else's. The same applies to Ma's motives and actions.    I didn't like the Great Escape in the middle of the book. It seemed to happen too sudden (though the author justifies this in some way with a foreclosure concern) and with a plan that appeared to rely on many assumptions that did occur one by one (Old Nick didn't look at the rug; granted Ma's wish regarding burial; had an open truck; Jack knew the sounds a truck does, etc.). I had to suspend disbelief there, but it was still acceptable.    After the escape, the book slows down quickly and never gains its flow back. I kept reading thinking that something big would happen, but it never does. The second part is not bad, it has what I consider good insights from Jack regarding life Outside, but I think it just drags for too long.
B00004R99J|5.0|Another Disney classic which delighted my granddaughter and me.  The story itself teaches important lessons about other cultures and is an overall delight.

I especially liked the \\"All Roads Lead to Rome\\" historical footers that are an option if one so chooses.    It's just a shame there was only two seasons of this show, IMO. I was left wanting more seasons.    Thanks, HBO!

B00005JN0T|5.0|I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies.  My favorite is Blade Runner - big, epic, beautiful.  It's rare that a movie is made which fully creates a believable world with the level of beauty and detail that you see here in I Robot.  I wasn't a huge fan at first - I mean, Will Smith?  (\\"Aw, hell no!\\") He's not the best for the role BUT - after having seen this numerous times (it's always on TV!) it has really grown on me.  It's a beautiful film - the robots, Sonny, the sets - I love looking at it all.  The plot - a little odd but - still believable.  Watching the main character robot, Sonny, is just awesome.  He's so well-done in this movie, it's just flawless CGI in a movie - for once!  Love it!  But yah - overall - this is one of my favorite Sci-fi movies out there, and much of that is on it's visual beauty.
B00004R99U|5.0|Another delightful movie that my granddaughter and I enjoy and one that I've added to her &#34;grandma's home&#34; collection.  The animation, color and presentation are of the typical excellent Disney quality and the story line is great as well.
0803732287|5.0|Good book for a 3-year-old.  Artwork is detailed with a vivid colored jungle theme.  The story is simple but interesting along the way.  It's about a little monkey that has lost his mother and a butterfly trys to help him find her.  Several other animals are introduced through the search for his mother.  Of coarse they find her at the end and the father too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I usually listen to music from the 60s and 70s and ignore today's charts. But when I heard some cuts from this album on Youtube, I decided to buy it. It far exceeded my expectations. I can listen to this album over and over again. It's so far from the autotune, popstar fake music of today. Often just her voice, piano, and strings, this album is full of raw emotion and music. You can connect to it. You can feel her pain about her breakup, and share that journey with her until she finally comes to terms with it in the end. Excellent album.
B00275EGX8|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies, war or not. if you have a particularly good audio/video setup, you will get that much more enjoyment out of this bluray.<br /><br />jeremy renner is great. the sound design and cinematography are top notch.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|I hate to pile on but this album was extremely disappointing. The others on here have articulated perfectly how I feel about this release. The only thing I can add is that David VIncent is bringing forth his work in Genitorturers and that is NOT a good thing. Please...go back to your roots.

B003L77G6A|3.0|I came into this show late and I had a lot of catching up to do, so I bought seasons 1 and 2 and watched season 3 on television. Then I went on and purchased season 3. I really think this is a great show, at one time it was the most original show on television and now I am noticing that it is steadily changing into a clone of everything else on television.  This is a real tragedy because now-a-days with everything being reality shows and boy/girl hook-ups and relationship dramas on television, The Big Bang Theory gave us something new. This show was a breath of fresh air and a necessary escape from the same old teen dramas, and sitcoms that were just teen dramas with laughter in the background. With Leonard, Sheldon, Rajesh (prob.spelled that wrong, sorry folks)Howard and Penny -the show was perfect. When they started adding the girlfriends -Bernadette, Amy, and now Pria, the show began to lose its originality and just became another show about a bunch dudes and thier chicks. However, I love Bernadette, she turned out to be a great character and I now think the show would suffer without her. I have said in other reviews that Amy is the worst, but I will admit her character has gotten a lot better in this season.  I think her lines are great, BUT!!! She needs to be separated from Sheldon.  These two characters are far too much alike to interact the way they do. Sheldon and Penny work off of each other much better and while at first I really disliked Amy's character I think that they could work with her in other ways, because (again) she did have some great lines this season.  Specifically when she called herself setting up boundaries for her and Penny's friendship and then shouted: \\"DONT TOUCH MY BREASTS\\", LMFAO!!! that was hilarious. Lately her calling Penny \\"BFF\\" is pretty funny too. Perhaps Penny and Amy can work off of each other and have the same success that Penny and Sheldon have. That just might work. PRIA HAS GOT TO GO! Her character serves no purpose. I really do not like this new thing with Leonard being the new hot ticket in town.  Leonard got Penny as a fluke and a twist of fate. Sheer luck and unlikely circumstance brought those two together and when he and Penny broke up, Leonard should have gone back to the nerd that no woman would look at twice. That would have been funny. I am also noticing that the friendships are disolving. It seems like they spend more time criticizing eachother and putting eachother down than hanging out and having Halo night. I am noticing that while Leonard is hanging with Pria and Howard is with Bernadette, Radjesh and Sheldon are always alone. Whats up with that? I will buy this, because although it is steadily being destroyed, it is still a good show with the possibility to return to the greatness it once was. They need to separate Amy and Sheldon, cancel out Pria and glue the geeks back together.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|Probably my review won't make sense, but Harry Potter just made me understand what the Jews felt when Jesus came to earth. I am waiting for the hero to unfold and I still don't understand why everyone wants to kill him, if he really seems to be weaker than everybody else. I know, he probably will do more for Part 2, but until then, I was like.. ok, so what make you special? really... the scar??
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|This album does deserve all the accolades it is receiving for the music in the other reviews.  But, I have a gripe about Susan singing every single song though.  Mike Mattison is too great a blues singer to be stuck as her backup singer.  Frankly, he's a better singer than she is.  He blew it out on Already Free and if this is going to be a trend with Derek and Susan, Mike needs to get a new band.

B0045U9WPU|4.0|Part Hunger Games, part Romeo & Juliet, this is hands down some of the deepest chick lit I've read in a long time. The story revolves around Lena, a teenager in a dystopian United States, awaiting to undergo a procedure that will cure her of love. The story is admittedly quite slow, and I was definitely guilty of skipping whole paragraphs, but the quality of the writing itself was much higher than other similar books, which made it slightly less painful. What really stood out to me was the revelations that the main character came to throughout the book; she really does grow before the readers' eyes. I also walked away from the book with a deeper appreciation for the story of Romeo & Juliet, which I had previously despised. I also really want to visit Portland now...so I encourage you to give it a try. I think I read that this hopes to become a trilogy. I am tempted to leave it as a standalone for myself.
0307887960|5.0|The Dukan Diet has been taking Europe by storm for a few years now, and I was glad to see the book finally available in the states. It is a great weight loss program when followed carefully with attention to proper hydration, given the high protein focus of the diet. The periods of consuming only protein are five days in length, and do provide immediate gratification in weight loss, but this is a book and diet for people who understand how the body works and the precautions necessary when only protein is consumed even for a short period.  The periods of heavy protein are broken up by periods where vegetables (and thank heavens, their fiber) are included. The maintenance portion of the program is very much like any good solid common-sense dietary program. This is a diet program than many urban warriors can fit into their busy-busy work/play lifestyle and enjoy the associated weight loss and its benefits.

B002ZG9968|3.0|There were things I loved and things I hated.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Alex O'Louglin's character is ridiculously adorable. He is sweet and funny and, unfortunately, a guy that we wish we could all catch but few could get. Even Jennifer Lopez is surprisingly amusing. I didn't have high hopes for her, but was was better than I expected.<br /><br />I hated the plot. There were several things that were just so out of the blue and ridiculous that I just rolled my eyes and stopped watching for a few minutes. There was a definite lack of realism here. Only once or twice did I laugh because of the actual plot. Everything seems  very much blown out of proportion.<br /><br />I was also rather disappointed with the ending. Terribly cliche and lame.<br /><br />The characters were the only thing that made the movie worth watching.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Let me begin by saying, I had some doubts about this album, mostly due to the ridiculous front cover. I mean, what were you thinking Kanye? But once you get past the front cover, and actually begin listening to the album, it's almost as if the world stops. The songs are amazingly crafted. Pieced together beautifully with amazing lyrics and orchestral backgrounds. To be honest, I didn't know that Kanye West had this in him. I've been a Kanye fan since before Graduation, and he's always had excellent lyrical skills to go with his producing talent, but this album represents an entirely different side of Kanye West. The blend of strings and rap in this album is just astounding. There are so many songs that I just love on this album: Blame Game, Dark Fantasy, Monster, All of the Lights, Gorgeous, Power, So Appalled, Runaway, and Lost in the World are all great. This album made me envision Kanye West as a mad scientist. He is a genius, slightly insane, but still a genius. Buy this album.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|[[ASIN:B004GHNHVW So Beautiful or So What (CD/DVD Deluxe)]]    I was delighted to see a new album by Paul Simon and ordered it straightaway when I heard it was on sale. \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" met my expectations, and I was gratified to see that Simon has continued his exploration of global sounds, incorporating them into his distinctive sound. It is a blending of style and philosophy that is missing in much contemporary music. For the established fan of Simon's work, or for new listeners who seek a new depth to their listening experience, this album will certainly satisfy. It is one that stimulates thought and totally involves the listener in the music for a rich musical experience.  I agree with Simon that such music is better enjoyed in the expansive atmosphere of a stereo system with speakers and not restricted to ear buds or headphones. It is music to share with others and perhaps a glass of wine of a relaxed summer evening.

0307887960|4.0|i picked up ths book because of the Dr. Oz show. The system seems pretty systematic, and i love meat, and with the all-you-can-eat anything in phase 3 and 4, i'd thought i give a try.    i never gone beyond phase 1, though. been back and forth from eating my chocolate chips cookies and the lean protein diet. however, during this time, i lost 3% of my weight, with my half-@$$ effort. i didn't do any of the walking per the Dukan prescription either.    eating out doesn't seem that difficult either. i eat out everyday, every meal, so that worked fine. just need to be a little more conscious when picking out the restaurant. i even went italian and i was fine. only difficult part is to find an explanation to people i eat with why i wasn't eating my favorite bread and desserts.
031261246X|4.0|As a techie by day and by night, I was looking forward to reading Zero Day. After hearing the glowing reviews of it from Steve Gibson on the Security Now podcast I decided to go ahead and buy myself a copy. I really debated on three or four stars and the remainder of my review should explain why.    Mr. Russinovich is well-known in technology circles and I was looking forward to an author who could actually write tech fiction and have it be accurate. In this regard I was not disappointed. While I would have liked it to delve even deeper into the tech side I realize that there are limits to what would be generally (as opposed to vertically) entertaining. He did an excellent job of appealing to the nerds of the world while keeping the story accessible to anyone with an interest in technology. That is a rare gift indeed. The story is engaging and paints a picture of a plausible, credible threat to our technology-laden society. It is eye-opening and frightening to think that this work of fiction could become non-fiction in the pages of tomorrow's newspaper. Mr. Russinovich's experience and contributions to the tech world serve to hammer that fact home.    But I titled this review \\"a good first start\\" for a reason. While the story and characters were engaging I thought that the character development could have been better for the majority of the major characters. The back story of Fajer is a good example of it being done right; I just wish it was done more consistently. Now, I should point out that I am generally a reader of authors like Neal Stephenson and I had just finished all four volumes of the \\"Book of the New Sun\\" by Gene Wolf before reading Zero Day, so it could be said that I am expecting far too much in the way of character development and scene-setting. But it wouldn't be an honest review if I didn't say that I'd like to see more in future novels from Mr. Russinovich. I thought the plot, while it had some twists, was fairly straight forward and basic. The solutions to problems were often a variation of the same theme (one all too often used in the tech industry.) There were a few points within the book where there were some contradictions in scene or action, sometimes on the same page - I found that distracting and the editors should have caught them because they didn't have to do with the tech aspects.    So I decided on four stars because it is so rare to find accurate tech in fiction, and Mr. Russinovich is a stellar person to ensure that it is indeed accurate. Zero Day is a fast read and it kept me engaged. I look forward to his next literary endeavor.

0345522478|5.0|I don't usually feel compelled to write reviews for the many books I read, but this one was a lot of fun. I've read a lot of urban fantasies by authors like Charlaine Harris, Patricia Briggs, Rob Thurman, etal; in which humour can be found in small doses. I've also read ones by Christopher Moore and A. Lee Martinez in which humour is found throughout; but until now I haven't read a book that blends humour with action and drama equally. Oberon the wolfhound's conversations with Atticus are hilarious. I can't wait to start reading book two and I look forward to book three next month. I really hope their story isn't gonna end in a trilogy, keep them coming Mr. Hearne!!
0140277447|2.0|I found this book unsatisfactory: it does not always substantiate its claims; it misrepresents certain facts, either deliberately or as a result of an excess of enthusiasm; and, in some instances, it relies on some evidence that has been shown to be fabricated. The saddest part about the emotionally-charged responses to this book is that so many people seem willing to insist on history AS THEY WISH IT TO BE, rather than as a fair reflection of verifiable facts.<br /><br />There is irrefutable evidence of large-scale Japanese atrocities in China, including in Nanjing. Their probable scale and the motivations for the actions of those involved are discussed in many reputable history books. Iris Chang's volume, however, does not contribute much to our understanding; its main effect has been to comfort existing prejudices, on both sides of the controversy, and fuel a lot of ugly and irrational commentary.
B00006CXSS|3.0|This is a great show, obviously.  Spielberg, Hanks, and HBO deserve high praise for delivering the story of Easy Company to the masses.  I echo just about every accolade written by the other reviewers (at least those I've read). And it comes in a lovely tin case to boot.<br /><br />But here comes the \\"but\\":  I cannot understand why the producers of the DVD did not include English subtitles.  It seems incredible to me that such an omission is even possible in enlightened times.  Reviewers with hearing impairments have already complained about this.  But even those of us whose hearing is fine have a legitimate beef.  My wife isn't exactly a war movie fan, so I watch films like this after she turns in for the night.  Consequently, I have to keep the volume low.  Which is why I always turn on the subtitles.  But B.o.B. has no English subtitles to turn on.  As a result, I missed about a third of the dialogue.  (Yes, I know there are remote headphones that I could buy, but why should I have to shell out $50 to encumber my ears when subtitles would do the trick?)<br /><br />Of all the DVDs I own, these are the very first to deny me the courtesy of English subtitles/closed captioning.  Unconscionable.  At the very least, there should be a prominently-placed caveat on the packaging (and at the top of Amazon's product description): \\"Warning: No English Subtitles.\\"  I thought of asking for a refund based on the near-fraudulent omission of captions, but I'll refrain.  Instead, I'll just plan to watch the series again -- when my wife goes on her next business trip and I can turn up the volume.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Lady GaGa has finally reached that lofty level where anything she releases is snapped up by everyone (I'm guilty too) - especially at 99 cents.  After listening to this I can tell she has lost her creative muse and is now just making noise for money.  It's comical to hear all the humming and \\"la la la dum de dum\\" gibberish,  excessive repetition, and abbreviated lyrics.  If you added all the lyrics up from all the songs I'd be surprised if you would end up with enough for a small paragraph.  Oh the music was unremarkable and under-whelming.  This marks the beginning of the end.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This is no longer .99!!! When I read Lady Gaga's album was only 99 cents on amazon I couldn't believe it. I thought to myself this can't be true, and rushed to the website, guess what? I was right, it's more like 9.99. Baiting customers is not a good strategy amazon. Shame on you.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This guy is one of the most promising American artists and this album is a great first proof of it.
1592402038|4.0|This review originally appeared on my blog.<br /><br />My major professor recommended I read this book when I began writing my dissertation. I stifled a groan and hoped the small smile on my face resembled a grin and not a grimace as I nodded my head in agreement. What was going through my mind was the nightmare recollection of reading Elements of Style for high school English class.<br /><br />In addition to this horrible memory, I also thought I was decent (better than most, dare I say) at grammar. I grew up doing the grammar and word quizzes in the Reader's Digest. I knew that I should use \\"couldn't care less\\" instead of \\"could care less\\" and that a semicolon separated two independent but related clauses. So why would I need to read a grammar book?  Needless to say, it took more than one prompting to actually check this book out of the library. But when I finally did, I was surprised to find, instead of the line after line of technical rules of how to properly punctuate and capitalize, funny anecdotal stories interspersed with easy to remember tenets of grammar.<br /><br />Lynne Truss does a wonderful job of keeping the book light and entertaining while dispensing valuable information of the history and proper use of punctuation and grammar. Though Truss is British, she notes where American English rules differ from British English rules. I highly recommend Eats, Shoots & Leaves to any writer (and if you are a high school English teacher have your students read this one as they will get so much more out of it).

B0041IU1H4|5.0|I am not going to talk about the music because I assume anyone looking to buy this disc already knows what a fantastic album this is (one of the best blues/rock debuts I've ever heard). This review is about the sound quality. In this case it equals the quality of the music. I have absolutely no idea what the One Star Reviewer is talking about, unless he is listening on a cheap boombox. I guess there are some people out there that like volume boosted, poorly mixed music. Mobile Fidelity has never let me down and this is no exception. They are very consistent in the quality of their releases, which is more than I can say about any other premium label (I liked the old DCC, but their successor (Audio Fidelity) is rather hit or miss). Even if you don't have an SACD compatible stereo system, the regular stereo layer of this CD easily surpasses any previous issue. Five Stars for both the material and the sound quality. Eagerly awaiting the release of the rest of the series, a couple are available now direct from MoFi's website for $30, but I usually wait until I can get them for 5 or 10 bucks cheaper here.
B00064WSNM|5.0|This review is for the Starless and Bible Black album in general. This is album has had several \\"re-issues\\", including the 30th, the box set live recordings of this tour called The Great Deceiver - (a must if you love this period), and The Night Watch (which is a concert recording that was used for the basis of much of this album, and part of the reason for my very favorable review.)    Lark Tongues In Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and Red (and the live album USA to be complete). Other periods of Crimson are great and wonderful as well (In the Court.., Islands, Discipline, Thrack - the great double trio! -The ConstruKction of Light), but I want to limit my review to this era of KC.    This trio of albums is really, in my opinion, one long work - a three part epic, a trilogy. If you want to taste this era of KC you must get all three.    Lark's Tongues is a masterpiece. Great songs, great concepts, great improves, and overall a masterful album of conceptions and executions. Bringing in Richard Palmer-James as lyricist was a stroke of genius, as Pete Sinfeld's concepts and wordplay would not have worked with this line-up. Richard Palmer-James's excellent english symbolism is perfect for this interplay of \\"impressionistic\\" progressive rock. Wetton, Bruford, Muir and Cross were the most perfect additions any band could ever hope to have. How Fripp managed to revive KC after the near-death experience of Earthbound is utterly amazing. Not that Islands was bad, in fact in my review I list it as a great album (in many ways it pointed to these next three albums), but the band and Fripp were not on the same page at all. Still, stealing Bruford from Yes, Wetton from Family and asking Muir to join, and that it actually happened - well how many bands make an all time classic record like \\"In The Court..\\" breakup a couple of times, and then come roaring back so hard that a third lineup is actually it's classic line-up. Amazing!    But chances are you already know about that part of the story. So, now about why Starless and Bible Black is the best of the three..    First of all, I don't really like saying one is better than another when I love them all equally. However, there are some differences that make Starless and Bible Black stand out. Lark's Tongues has perhaps the best songs of the three, but it suffers from two things - one, the band was new and they were (especially Wetton and Bruford - the two most important new members), holding back, dipping their feet in and finding their place, and you can hear it. Wetton's tone was great but reserved, as was Bruford's. Bruford sounded like he was still in Yes, and Muir had not quite yet rubbed off on him (as would be evident on the following album - Starless and Bible Black). Also, I believe Lark's Tongues was recorded at Air Studios (a fine studio indeed), but the production suffered a bit with a thin sound at times. Wetton's bass not quite booming and distorted enough. Fripp's guitar tone a little harsh. Bruford a little thin too. But despite these two faults, Lark's Tongues is a perfect album. (Edit: Perhaps the 30th or 40th Anniversary Editions have rectified this somewhat, but still they're playing wasn't as big as it would be on the next album).    Let me skip to Red for a moment. Another great record that was HEAVY, scary, beautiful, and sexy. Yes, it was certainly RED (Edit: See the 40th Anniversary Edition for jaw dropping heaviness, not to mention 5.1 mixes). However, I find a couple of faults here too. My main problem with Red is that it is too short. There are basically four really great songs and one misplaced improve, Providence, that would have been better placed on Starless and Bible Black (but actually not good enough for that album either). Red is sequenced as good as it could be, but imagine a couple of more songs on side B and Red would be the winner. But Red was recorded so loud that either they couldn't fit any more songs on the vinyl, and/or because they had broken up, they didn't have any more new material. I'm afraid both are the case. Red had moved on from Starless and Bible Black and they couldn't put older material on that album. Anything they were to put on that album had to be new. Side A represents that new sound well. The last track (oddly named Starless) was from the Starless and Bible Black touring period, but it made a great ending to this band's existence. Starless contained musical elements of both the current KC, and the original KC, complete with an appearance by Ian McDonald. How perfect is that? Fripp, McDonald, Wetton and Bruford (with Mel Collins and David Cross to boot!). A KC supergroup!    Now to my point. What Starless and Bible Black is the best. While maybe not quite conceptualized as well as Lark's Tongues (although it's equal really, it's just that Lark's Tongues' was planned out and arranged very strategically), and maybe not as heavy and accessible as Red, Starless and Bible Black had a couple of things going for it that the others did not. The production AND conceptualization are 100% perfect. The recording (at Command studios I believe, but I may have Lark's Tongues and Starless reversed), is massively huge. The ebbs and flows of energy and ambience are as perfect as could be. Great songs to start off the album in The Great Deceiver and Lament. Powerful and beautiful improves in We'll Let You Know, Trio, The Mincer, a beautiful ballad in The Night Watch, and then there is side two. Shear power. The title track Starless and Bible Black starts ominously quite but begins to build, ever stronger and stronger until it's a full out power jam with Wetton and Bruford in a total hypnotic fury, and then it settles down - like a storm brewing and the slamming you only to leave you and the destruction it caused. Stunning! As if that's not enough, then comes another storm, another masterpiece in Fracture. Again, quietly coming, building, changing, and then again slamming you hard, this time with Fripp in overdrive (with his Whole-tone Scale goodness), and Wetton and Bruford again in a total hypnotic fury! Brilliant.     Starless and Bible Black may or may not have a running time longer than Lark's Tongues, certainly more so than Red, but it feels longer because there is so much there. Part of all this magic is due to that band recording the tracks live and singing and doing overdubs in the studio (not the whole album, but parts of it), and it really brings out the power and sound of this band. Red captured it too, but too briefly.    Starless and Bible Black  is a prog masterpiece. Any aspiring band that wants to be a good live band must listen to this record. Buy all three. But let this middle album sink in. Put some studio quality headphones on and turn off the lights late at night. You WILL be taken to places that you may or may not wish to go.    Good luck!
0756951410|4.0|Book: The Lovely Bones    In \\"The Lovely Bones\\", the author presented the idea of value behind the death of a young girl, in a way that opened the deep thought of life and its meaning to me, and the impact of our life upon authors. I enjoyed the sequence of events in detail that showed hints of the different emotions that \\"Susie\\" experienced to show the impact simple things can have upon us, once we realize we will never experience the same. Although, the specific instances such as the affair of the mother had caused me to misjudge her character but later on when I had the chance to understand her failure to express her yearning to have \\"Susie\\" back, with the need to escape through sex with Len. I disliked that because it disproved the idea that behind the death of family member creates an even closer relationship and need among the relatives.  Yet, it was the connection between \\"Susie\\" and her father, as she remembered each instance she would help him build small ships inside bottles that reminded me of the little things we take for granted. In addition, having the memorial for \\"Susie\\" after a year of her death made Susie realize the lives she impacted such as her teachers; and how her death had spread to students she hardly knew but still felt the need to remember her existence.  Overall, I enjoyed it and I recommend it to any adolescent or adult that wishes to read it for fun. By reading this novel it will bring a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the little things we fail to notice in our lives, and often disregard. You will find it intriguing, sensitive, and mysterious while trying to solve the clues of the numerous murders under George Harvey's fake name.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney is back, and \\"Femme Fatale\\" might be her best album yet. It's a different sound for Brit, edgier and even more uptempo than all of her albums that came before. My favorite songs are \\"Till The World Ends\\", \\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"I Wanna Go\\", \\"Big Fat Bass\\", and \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\", which is the closest Britney has ever come to being a hard rocker.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I was reluctant at first to read this book -- let alone like it -- but I quickly found myself drawn in by Gaiman's apt style that led me, ever spiraling, through layers and layers of compelling and fascinating characters.  I've since picked up other pieces of his work and have found his writing is consistently to be admired.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Really entertaining and fun. The picture quality and sound are good also. PJ and Eddie never put out a disappointing product. My only gripe is that their newer bootlegs are CD-R's which I find to be a waste of money. But, over all they put out quality products.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|The problem with this album is Lady Gaga doesn't want to lose her pop music fans but she wants to be alternative and original at the same time. So everything gets messed up. She wants to give everything in one box. But the box doesn't carry as much as she wants so things drop out: techno, rock, dance, electronic music .. she wants to be perfect it seems, every track was worked with effort. Gaga wants everybody listens to her music, she tries to take attention of all music listeners. She wants to be a legend, you can understand it with this effort.<br /><br />But it doesn't work; There are so many \\"stolen\\" melodies from 80's and 90's. In some songs pop arrangements are very powerful but they are simple and ordinary, there's nothing new in it. The album makes you tired and full of hard techno ryhtms almost same in every song. You get excited with \\"marry the night\\" at the begining but you lose this excitement after; even if you don't want to. Gaga also wants to give social messages but this is not a concept album at the same time. It's like \\"i want to tell you this this this, do this this this\\",  with \\"born this way\\", \\"hair\\", \\"bad kids\\".. and when it's done; \\"well lets forget it and back to have fun again\\", with \\"government hooker\\", \\"heavy metal lover\\" etc.. every song is different from each other so you can not get what Gaga really wants to tell.<br /><br />Also, the album is too long when it doesn't need to be. Because there is no special instrumantation. Acoustic instruments lost their way in songs because of the hard techno, they cannot flow together.  Rock songs and electro guitar solo arrangements don't sound fresh. The guitar solo melodies are like they were written in 1980's. so where's the originality?<br /><br />her debut and then the fame monster were presenting more clear and certain sound and they had a concept. but btw does not have that clear presentation although it has more messages and although the changes she had through.<br /><br />I like Lady Gaga.She is a great artist. Born This Way is a very good pop album especially comparing with other pop albums of current time. But we need to be honest, this is not ground breaking album and definitely \\"not\\" the album of decade. The most successful albums in history are generally \\"concept\\" albums and the albums that have great instrumantation. But Born This Way is a product of scatter, confused mind.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|One of my old favorites.  I don't know what made me think about it, but I knew I needed a Bagdad Cafe fix.  Three adjectives?  Funny, touching, uplifting.

B0002HZHXG|2.0|This product is \\"made in China\\" and not \\"made in Germany\\" as stated.  At about $8, this thing is expensive.  This light and sound module should come with every Bruder vehicle.      Back to the unit iteself, it looks and feels cheap.  The plastic is different from the Bruder vehicle plastic.  The sound is loud enough and clear.  You press one of four red dots to turn on and you press it again to turn off.  I would still buy it to complement my son's expensive Bruder vehicles and to enhance the playbility.

0553384775|2.0|Like from the movie Tropic Thunder, \\"Never Go Full Retard....\\" And that is exactly what this author does.  What do I mean?  The author, Jordan B., loses all redeeming qualities in his story of his drug addicted, criminal activity to his rise to the top.  Everyone wants to root for the bad guy; however, his style of detailing his excesses over, over and over again in simple inner dialog make you skip pages and wonder out loud, \\"why am i reading this?\\"  This is a story of one, dare I say sociopath?      The sad part about this read, is that this could have been good.  What drives a young man to apply his god given talents to rip so many people off?  To what lengths will someone go to not get caught stealing millions of dollars?  How hard would you work if you knew you could make millions almost overnight?    These are questions that the book fails to answer, but maybe the movie will.  The story of the author reminds me of people that i know that were in the mortgage game.  Everyone was doing it, everyone was making money, and you could literally write your own check by your own work ethic (never mind your moral values and by everyone, I mean everyone in the building).    I was attracted to this book because of the movie Boiler Room, \\"Slanging the white mans crack rock.....\\", Youth today, or should i say smart, ambitious, predominately white kids, everyday enlist in legal forms of what the author is trying to describe. I feel he just got stuck on the attraction and excess of it all and not on the heart of the matter.  Mortgage backed securities, Enrons', Goldman Sachs, cannot happen unless you have the hustlers, the gamblers, and GREED.  Its just that those i just mentioned are ran by old rich white guys from the Ivy League and the author came from Long Island and wanted it for himself.    I appreciate the authors honesty but if he would have stuck to more substance of the how, what and why, this book could have been a voice of a generation - Very disappointing.  Readat your own caution.    - JSchulz City of Angles, CA
B0052VUNHC|5.0|WOW!!!! This book was so much netter than I thought it would be!!! I have already reread it since I finshed it!! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!!! Abby is a small town girl from Kansas that she tries to forget about when she goes away to college leaving all but her best friend America behind to start their freshmen year. There America falls in love with Shepley causing Abby to be around quite a bit, especially when his playboy roommate Travis Maddox lays eyes on her and realize his beautiful tattooed body and walking one night stand persona is not going to \\"bag\\" (as he refers to it in the book) Abby. Happy to except the challenge they two of them become inseperable and feelings blossom into something more.<br />What I love about this book is that each of the characters grow into even stronger characters and actually learn the heartaches of falling in love and that reality is not always peachy!!! I like how the relationship between Travis and Abby is followed all the way through to show how they grow into adults and learn that love is a changing factor for even the stubborn, hard headed and selfish!!!<br />I absolutely love this book. I love that for once the main character is a strong young women who doesnt just fall in love at first sight like in so many of the other YA novels I have read so far!! Feelings form and develop as the characters interact all throughout the book and change each others lives. I love how McGuire follows their relationship all the way through so you feel a sense of closure as to their future when you are done reading. I definately recommend this book to everyone, although YA should be warned that it refers to strong sexual content and violence.
0525422943|4.0|Let me start out by saying that after reading the first book, If I Stay, I wasn't really expected to start this one to find out that Mia and Adam weren't still together.  I was completely shocked to discover she had \\"left,\\" so to speak, and that had Adam had been living a separate life.  I guess I should have guess it though, considering that she stayed in If I Stay, but this book is called Where She Went.  Yeah, I'm tired.  Bear with me.<br /><br />That said, I found that I barely had time to be disappointed in this because the new story immediately sucked me in and got me invested.  May I say how much I really enjoy having this told from Adam's point of view?  At times, his internal dialogue is so heartbreaking as he struggles through what has become a not so happy life.  You can tell immediately that he still loves and misses Mia.<br /><br />When the two of them meet, I expected the author to drag on a back and forth \\"run and I'll chase you\\" game, but she surprised me again by doing no such thing.  She kept the two together as they just spent one evening going from place to place and talking.  I loved it!!<br /><br />I won't say more because I don't want to give anything else away.  But this book was really really worth the read.  I love the author's voice.  The book was sad, but joyful and pleasure to read.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|Really like all aspects of this album. Lyrics, Vocals, instrumental etc. Junior Gong and Nas gave us their perception of the world, a slightly deeper one that most musicians' today. Thanks for sharing guys!
B001VNB54A|4.0|I watched this series on HBO.  Although I think that \\"Band of Brothers\\" was much better, I purchased \\"Pacific\\" to complement my DVD of \\"Band\\".  Both are incredibly realistic with only the Normandy invasion in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" surpassing them.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I loved this movie as a teen, and love that my daughter enjoyed it too. As a teen I saw alot of my friends in these characters and I could relate to them . I saw the same recognition dawn in my daughters eyes.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a return to a more classical storyline that is geared towards both adults and children.  There are several parts where I laughed out loud startling even myself.  The movie moves along quickly, no time for yawning, and the story is just different enough to warrant watching this movie over and over again.  I would highly recommend Tangled to anyone that is looking for a permanent addition to their collection.
0312600844|1.0|Our book club selected \\"Freedom\\" for our most recent discussion. Everyone disliked the book. I read about 1/3 of the book and decided I wouldn't bother to finish it. There are so many great books available that it makes no sense to waste time with a lousy one. My summary of \\"Freedom\\": A book about unlikeable characters who make stupid choices that mess up their lives and then blame other people for the mess, written by an author who doesn't like people.
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|Great description of the outing of CIA spy, Valerie Plame-Wilson.  As with all movies, this one took some liberties.  But the main story was accurate.  Those of you who remember the whole affair can recall the incredible amount of wrong information that was disseminated about her actual role in the CIA.  This movie sets that straight.  Although never mentioned once in the movie, Plame-Wilson graduated from Pennsylvania State University, as was I.  \\"We are.....\\"!
0743289692|5.0|This book was a real eye-opener for me. Written by someone that has experienced Islam first hand, this Christian was appalled at the cruelty and violence that occurs in the \\"Religion of peace.\\" Sure, only one person's experience, but very enlightening nonetheless. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down, and I bore very easily.
0345529057|5.0|Apart from these books being fantastically written (for a mature read). The price is a bargain. Four sturdy books with nice thin pages which are great to hold are well worth the money. Shipping to Australia was fast with the books arriving within 2 weeks.     A must read for anyone who wants a good book with great plots.     I recommend that if you were brought to these books because you have seen some of the HBO series to refrain from watching nay more of the show until you have read the book. The book is so much better than the show.    Cheers,    Geoff
B004Y03LQ2|3.0|So it's quite obvious Maiden loves to issue a new compilation every couple of years in between albums, mainly for the tour. It's really only aiming at the newer fans or even some older fans coming back to the band and may have missed alot of the newer material. For the hardcore fans(myself included), there's really no reason to buy this other than for collection purposes, maybe a road-trip mix, or just cause the album art is really cool. I'll say that each album from this period is represented nicely, except for really strong songs like Judas Be My Guide, From Here to Eternity (the title of the album obviously rips of this song's title, so why wasn't it included is beyond me), Wasting Love,& The Fugitive from the Fear of the Dark record, Ghost of the Navigator, Dream of Mirrors(!), and The Thin Line Between Love and Hate from Brave New World, Wildest Dreams and Montsegur from Dance of Death, and The Talisman from the lastest album The Final Frontier. But wait, didn't we forget something? The Blaze year. Just like they did to the Paul Di'Anno material on Somewhere Back In Time, they've replaced the original studio recordings with live recordings featuring Bruce. Personally, I don't really have a problem with this on the Blaze material, because Bruce does a great job, but none the less, the new fans deserve to hear the different sides of Maiden to fully appreciate how great a band they are. They only gave us 3 songs of the Blaze material, Man on The Edge, Sign of the Cross, and The Clansman. All excellent songs, but deserve to be heard by Blaze for the fan to judge. Also, songs like Lord of The Flies, Blood On the World's Hands, and The Edge of Darkness (all these from The X Factor album) and Futureal(from Virtual XI) would have fit nicely on here. Overall, this is a pretty good representation of the band up till now for the new or casual fan. Let me say this, I've never met a casual Maiden fan, you usually love and live for them or don't get it. So if you're new and reading this, start buying the albums and you will not regret that investment in one of the best metal bands ever to grace the earth.reading this, start buying the albums and you will not regret that investment in one of the best metal bands ever to grace the earth.
0066620996|3.0|I recently changed positions and am no longer in a managerial role but was looking for a little inspiration.  I was hoping by the early pages in the book that this was the book for me.  Early on, the authors state that you do not have to be a manager to be a leader but the majority of the references within the book were made for those that have staff reporting directly to them.  However, it was an easy read and I still walked away with a few items that may be of reference later.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|I was pumped to see this when i first saw the trailer and although it didnt quite deliver on the extraordinarily high standard set for itself in the trailer i still enjoyed every minute of it and was genuinely riveted at times. First rate action and effects coupled with a  breath taking pace makes for great fun. A must for war and action buffs. If i had one complaint it would be a little lack of creativity in terms of the aliens themselves who you rarely get a good look at. Other than that pretty damn fun.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a good port from the pc. It doesn't have all of the features of the original but it still very good. The touch screen works well for the game.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|I usually don't do reviews but I really feel like I need to chime in here. As a long time Morbid Angel fan I was giddy with excitement when I heard the news that Dave Vincent had returned and coulden't wait to hear some new material. I saw MA a few times on the during the Formulas/Gateways era and Trey was one of coolest dudes I've ever met he invited me and my friends on to his bus and we all sat around and played Twisted Metal 2 in the back of the bus, who does that? As we all sat around in the bus gaming and smoking sombody asked Trey what Dave was up to and his reply was, \\"He's doing somthing with his wife's band, I don't know what it is but it's not Death Metal.\\" Now I must state hear and now that I do listen to a wide variety of music some rap, various forms of rock ie. classic, alternative, punk, and a whole lot of Metal, thrash, black, death, industrial, you get the point. When i listen to Metallica I want to hear Metallica not over produced Nirvana hence why Load was so awful but I won't go into all that. Let's just say if you cut out all the crap on this album it would make a decent Death Metal EP but as you look through the song titles you see names that don't really sound very \\"Morbid Angel\\" the less \\"Morbid\\" the title the less \\"Morbid\\" the song and these guys can't do much outside of the Death Metal they have pioneered.     Omni Potens- This is an instrumental, a build up a song that can be played live at the beginning of a set to get crowd amped up for what's about to come. But if those fans have heard this album and are rabid MA fans it may start a riot.    Too Extreme!- No your CD is not skipping, and no it's not a Vanilla Ice cover it's somehow worse. First off we all know how \\"extreme\\" Morbid Angel is but extreme metal bands don't go around bragging about how extreme they are they usually don't have to. But this song just sounds like something I would expect from Orgy or Static. Now lets tempt fate; can it get any worse?    Existo Vulgore- Now thatis some Morbid Angel it could be a little better but it erases the bad taste from track 2.    Blades for Baal- It's getting better another real Metal track with some blast beats, can't wait to hear what's next!!!    I am Morbid- I guess I got a little ahead of myself, not a bad song but not a good Morbid Angel song, sounds more like some early Soulfly. Lyrics are lame chest pumping cheesiness I would expect from 90's hip-hop.    10 More Dead- This one is decent, but it's still not very \\"Morbid Angel\\" and the chorus really kills it and more lame lyrics.    Destructos vs. The Earth/Attack- Ok i have to admit this is a bit catchy, I kinda like it but it is not Morbid Angel. If this were on a Rammstien album,or even Pain I would love it but I bought a Morbid Angel album and I want to hear some Death Metal.    Nevermore- Another true Morbid Angel track and arguablly the best song on this album. It was also pretty good 4 four years ago when it first started popping up on youtube.    Beauty Meets Beats- As unpredictable and un death Metal as this album has been so far from the title I would half expect a power ballad but there are some blast beats and somewhat reminiscent of \\"Where the Slime Live\\" but like \\"10 More Dead\\" the chorus really brings it down. Maybe this record is'nt so bad.    Radikult- Remember when we tempted fate? This is by far the absolute worst song ever recorded by any band claiming to be \\"Metal\\" everin the history of recorded music, take that statement however you please. Where do I start, the lyrics \\"Kill A Cop, Kill A Cop\\" or the opening riff that sounds (and I'm not exagerating this) like a George Michael riff with distortion, If \\"Master Evil D\\" isn't careful he's gonna get sued by George Micheal and Ice T as the same time.    Profundis Mea Culpa- Now at this point I'm just spent after the garbage that just transpired I don't have the energy to do this one let's just say it's nothing to write home about.    So there you go there's my two cents on the most anticipated Death Metal Album probably ever. If this is What Vincent brings to the mix than maybe Steve Tucker should come back. At least Pete Sandoval's resume hasen't been tarneshed by this.       Existo
B004EPYZOO|1.0|I've always been a Nicolas Cage fan but now I must reconsider if he continues to do flicks like this.  The acting is beyond hammy.  My husband loves shoot 'em up movies and everything in the movie's description.  However, after about 15 minutes of sheer agony, we turned the movie off and promptly returned it to Redbox.  My husband was laughing and kept commenting on how \\"stupid\\" the movie was and wanted to shut it off.  It fell very short of even being entertaining.  Laughable...yes.  Sad for Nicolas Cage to have his name associated with it....Definitely!    Don't waste your money!  After reading the other comments, I'm very glad we didn't get past the first 15 minutes.  Evidentally and unbelievably....it did get worse.
B00005QGAX|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite MJ album. MJ rocks and in my opinion this is better than Thriller or Off The Wall. Michael truly rocks out on this album on songs like Dirty Diana,Another Part Of Me, and all the others. Michael is truly Bad.
0062085743|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes.

0307887960|5.0|I could not be happier with this diet. Amazingly, I have not felt like I am being restricted by a diet like I have in the past with several others that I have been on. Although I only needed to lose 15 pounds when I began the diet last Wednesday (it's now Thursday, 8 days later), I have already lost 8 of it; so I have 7 to go. What felt MIRACULOUS to me was that on the third day of the diet, some friends of mine were in town and I needed to take them out to eat. Naturally I recommended my all-time favorite restaurant which is a Mexican restaurant. Now... whenever I visit this restaurant I always eat one thing and one thing only. In the 5 years that I have been a regular patron here, I have never tried anything else on their menu as I love this dish so much! On this day, bearing in mind that I was on Dukan's, I suggested the dish to one of my friends who was undecided about what to order (she loved it too btw)and I ordered two very lean grilled chicken breasts cooked with little to no grease but just the chef's choice of seasoning. To my amazement, I wasn't even tempted in the least bit to ask for a taste of my friends' dish. From reading other reviews before I invested in the book, I'd heard that within a matter of days cravings diminish greatly and I can confirm that for sure. I also always kept cake in the house from my favorite bakery for those mid night sugar cravings and in the last week I've just been passing by it, leaving it for my husband to indulge in. Well... the real test comes next week as I will be on vacation at an all inclusive resort in the islands. Wish me well!    Oh... I also have made it back to a size 4 from being a 6/8 in the last few years while needlessly trying to get back there for the last 3-4 years... all in a week's work. I'm so happy!!!    Not sure why I feel like adding this but here are some stats about me.    - I'm 5'2\\" (previously 138 pounds)  - I did the attack phase for 7 days and I'm on my 2nd day of the cruise phase. My plan was to alternate the 5 days of protein with the 5 days of protein and vegetables but since I'll be on vacation next week, I opted to start off with the 1 by 1 plan. I'll get to the 5 by 5 plan once I return home from my rendezvous hoping that I haven't fallen prey to cravings while gone.  - I'm not sure if my success story has anything to do with working out more than 20 minutes a day as the wise doctor recommends. In the last 7 days I have attended 2 high calorie burning spin classes at my gym. The other days, I have been alternating running and walking with every other song on my iPod so as not to burn myself out. This totaled a 3 mile distance and approximately 40-45 minutes whenever I did this.

B000EGF0NW|5.0|Lucky by Alice Sebold was published in 1999 and has hundreds of editorial and reader reviews. It is a seminal memoir on the subject of rape, giving permission to other victims to break their silence. The book is so important, it merits opinion eleven years later.<br /><br />The book begins with the terrifying experience of the author being raped. It's graphic, it's real, and it hurts to read. Alice was able to tell the events in a clear voice that could have gotten lost in the chaos of the long ordeal. A memoir about rape is a writing nightmare, yet Sebold creates enough connection between author and reader to generate compassion for the victim and rage at the perpetrator. Then, he apologized!<br /><br />Alice had few friends to run to, and relied on acquaintances and strangers to help her in the aftermath, which is ugly, painful, and infinite. Within the story, the reader will find exactly how a rape victims feels: \\"damaged goods, ruined.\\" Or from a different planet.<br /><br />Sebold examines her family dynamics as she tries to recover. It appears that each member of her family lives on a different planet, revolving around each other but never really making contact. Her mother has anxiety; her father is isolated; her sister is perfect. This sets Alice up for taking the journey alone while trying to maintain her sanity, a grade point average, and the court proceedings.<br /><br />The transcripts of the court proceedings are long and arduous. One can only imagine what it must have been like for Alice to be the witness in her rape trial, being put on the spot, with soiled underwear sworn into evidence. You'll find clever comments by Sebold that help the reader grasp intonations of sarcasm and scorn from the perpetrator's attorneys. Sebold was strong enough to survive when others would have folded.<br /><br />Alice admitted to a common result of sexual violence, which is using drugs to escape. She discovered that she has post-traumatic stress disorder. She does not sugar-coat the violence that is rape, the intimidation that is the criminal justice system, or the ironies of life that is stranger than any fiction.<br />[[ASIN:0465087302 Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence--from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror]]intimidation that is the criminal justice system, or the ironies of life that is stranger than any fiction.

So I got the album and I got to say[[ASIN:B004K7HMJ6 Who You Are]]  I love it!  It didn't disappoint and I love the first 2 songs of the album!  Some of the other songs weren't really my taste but overall it was worth the money!  But seriously listen to her live/ascoustic covers of her songs! No autotune folks!!!

B004EPYZU8|3.0|All of the elements were there: originality, metaphors, a talented cast, a great soundtrack and the crucial statements of self-sacrifice, the ability to create our own stories, abusive authority, reality versus our dreams, and the power of feminism. Somehow, even with so much material, Zack Snyder failed to deliver any of these concepts very strongly in Sucker Punch.  When Babydoll (Emily Browning) gets sent to a mental asylum by her wicked step-father after her mother's death, she has five days to escape the impending lobotomy that has been scheduled for her under his command. As Babydoll retreats into her imagination where reality blurs with fantasy, she becomes a dancer at a brothel along with four other patients that have been wrongly imprisoned. Babydoll teams up with Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jenna Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) in order to escape their captors. To escape the girls need to collect five items, and each time Babydoll dances, they are given the chance to get the next item as they are thrown into yet another reality.  The plot has many clear holes that are difficult to ignore: the audience never actually gets to see Babydoll's hypnotic dance, and the majority of the characters were removed in a rather rushed, uncreative way. Most criticism that the film has faced is along the lines of the power of women in an abusive environment, and it is easy to see how women with machine guns and short skirts twirling around can be seen as more objectifying then empowering.    Throughout the layers of realities one might mistake this film for Inception, however everything is so plainly spelt out that it lacks pretty much any intellectual concepts that one might hope to get from a reality bending movie. The movie would have been more enjoyable for me if it was just about the five girls in the asylum, because all the rawness that would be there has been covered up and polished by the fantasy worlds.    The most prevailing idea was presented at the end of the movie, are we living our own life or are we just a supporting character for someone else's? Sucker Punch dares us to live life for ourselves and to make the story we live, our own.

030746363X|5.0|Before I read this book I had never been a member of a gym and hadn't done any exercise for about 5 years.    After reading it I was inspired to join a gym and have been going three times a week for the last 3 months - and more importantly, really enjoying it.    There's absolutely loads of interesting ideas in this book, but the most important thing for me was the attitude it instills- a desire to take charge of your body in whichever way you want to, and a belief, through so many possible methods, that you actually can, and quickly.    I've recommended this book to nearly everyone I know, so now I recommend it to you too,
0312323859|5.0|i absolutely loved this book! i was not disappointed, i read something borrowed and had to read the second part. i could not put it down and finished it in four days. i must admit i did not want it to end. one of my all time faves, i highly recommend this series, i hope to see more from this author.
0441009425|5.0|I am a big fan of this series. The writing can be dense at times, but the ideas that are broadcasted in the story and those that are implied, or set in the background, are really cool.
0446619078|3.0|Maybe I was expecting too much based on the reviews I read.  This is isn't the first Michael Connelly novel I've read, I thought Echo Park was good.  The pace was just a bit slow for me. After more than 20 chapters I'm still waiting for the big bang.
B000Q8QH0I|2.0|If I were to tell you that I just saw a basic cops and robbers movie with not-all-that-hidden conspiracies, intertwining plot threads that aren't really brought together in a meaningful way, and a shootout that ends with all the good guys alive and all the bad guys dead, I don't think too many people would complain or vote this review down for an average movie.  But for LA Confidential, I'm sure that I'll get one or two percent helpful votes.      Having now seen this movie twice, I can honestly say that I just don't get what the appeal of this \\"classic\\" really is.      When I saw this movie back in 1997, I thought it took way too long to get interesting, and had far too many scenes just thrown in for the sole purpose of waking up the audience (see Guy Pearce sex scene, which came out of nowhere).  As I watch this movie again on Blu-Ray, trying vainly to figure out what it is that I missed, I can see a little bit of reason to like it, but not a whole lot.      In a film that is as star-studded as this was, it's easy to get lost in the fold if you're not up to par with the rest of the cast.  While Kevin Spacey's storyline is probably the most interesting of all the cops, his performance was too laid back, and I'd never imagine him as the cocky, starry-eyed consultant for the most popular TV show on the network which we're told he is.  Danny DeVito, who is usually phenomenal, plays the most light-hearted, happy-go-lucky scumbag reporter I've ever seen on screen.  And Kim Basinger won an award for this?  My memory is foggy, but 1997 must have been a severely down year for the ladies out there.      The plot is...simpler than it seems.  From the opening scene, we're basically taken hand-in-hand through a basic cops and robbers story with twists that are sometimes so convoluted that they have to be spelled out through long dialog lines before we get that they mesh.  Spacey's character pulls out a business card for a porn studio, and cannot get anyone on the line when hecalls them up.  Guy Pearce's character wins an award for solving a mass-murder and gets a tidbit that suggests that a rape victim was lying to him about timing.  One interview later where they learn very little, and that's really all it takes for these two characters to decide that their cases must be intertwined, and by the end of the movie, it's all about drugs and a conspiracy.      There's a lot going on in this movie, which is probably what led most people to think that it was complicated and intriguing.  I don't think that's the right word - convoluted and messy fit better for me.      It's interesting to watch certain elements come together (at least the ones that work), and the character development on the side of most of the cops is pretty good.  The final shootout is completely unbelievable, as Crowe and Pearce take about about 30 cops and make it out alive, but it is exciting.  I think Pearce and Crowe do a fantastic job in their roles, as does James Cromwell.  I would tend to think that David Strathairn does a good job of playing a millionaire covering up a dirty secret, but I think he might have been as oblivious as I am about what his role in the story was supposed to be.  For all that they did right in this film, I think this is a movie worth seeing, but to call it a \\"modern day classic\\" goes much to far.      This is, in my opinion, one of the more overrated movies of the 90's.
B00138GZ5W|5.0|I actually have had this whole album on my ipod for years but never listened to any track other than, \\"Atlantic City.\\" I let it all play, though, a few weeks ago and was mildly stunned at how amazing this entire album is. Atlantic City had always seemed like a great snapshot of the Reagan era. Trickle down economics which never quite trickled down to those at the lowest rungs of society. However, when I listened to the protagonist of Johnny 99 talking about the bank taking his house away, folks who turn to crime only after they can't find jobs, the piling up of debt, I realized that this album is timeless and as relevant as ever.  Highlights for me are the dark, Starkweather inspired title track Nebraska, Atlantic City, Johnny 99, State Trooper, and the blackly ironic Reason To Believe,  I cannot recommend this album highly enough. Stark with almost unimaginable power. The tracks just carry the listener along through all of the tales of despair. I went to work, more thankful than ever for my job and for the fact that, for now, I have little in common with the narrators of these songs. This is a must listen for anyone who likes Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash or Bob Dylan.
1400052181|4.0|The primary reason I enjoyed this book is for its honesty. The author documents her evolving relationship with the Lacks family without holding back or masking any elements of truth and it is precisely this kind of honest, true to life storytelling that like me, many readers appreciate and enjoy. A large portion of the book is dedicated to the scientific journey of HeLa cells, a fascinating story in itself whose scientific jargon is beautifully and comprehensively explained by the author. While the afterword follows up on the controversial issue of donors' rights that was discussed throughout the book, it tends to read like a dry article in a scientific journal or paper and I found it to be an issue I cared very little for. However, this is unlike the rest of the book that tells the actual story of the Lacks family and the cells.
1586487981|4.0|Practical insights into the thought processes of the chronically poor the world over.  You need to walk in their shoes to appreciate their problems and their solutions to those problems.   Policy makers need to incorporate the findings of the author and need patience to work the promising solutions that the author outlines in his research.  Everyone should put on a pair of the shoes of the poor and walk with the author -- you will have a new appreciation of the problems of the poor and the \\"logic\\" that dictates their behavior. With an open mind maybe we can hope to find realistic solutions to world poverty.
1593272839|5.0|One of my long withstanding goals as a developer has been to try and understand functional programming. I'm primarily a .NET developer and have been captivated by the growing influence of functional programming on the .NET framework since the introduction of generics and LINQ. After trudging through a couple of F# books and watching some of Erik Meijer's videos on Channel 9, I still found myself looking for something to help things click for me. So, I looked to Haskell. When searching for a good introduction to Haskell, I came across this book. Not only is this one of the best programming books I've read, it was perfect for getting me to that \\"a-ha\\" moment with functional programming. Terms that used to go in one ear and out the other, or remind me of my favorite Indian dish, finally started to make sense. It's good to work outside of the box and get those little gray cells fired up. The explanations are so concise and simple that even I could understand it. In previously futile attempts to understand Monads, I found myself reading and re-reading explanations by others to little avail. Not so with this book. And the chapter explaining types and type classes is pure gold. Kudos to the author for providing a clear, simple, and informative introduction to functional programming concepts via Haskell. For other .NET developers seeking to learn about functional programming, do yourself a favor and read this book first, before you try playing with F#.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|It is amazing how while watching the movie for the first time I didn't realised what it was about and how the plot actually worked out in it. At first I didn't really understand why Nina was so depressing and dramatic over a role nor the weird things that happened to her during the whole film. I was wondering if this movie had a science fiction kind of thing going on here and there or if Nina was actually trying drugs to deal with her reality. It was at the end then that I understood the whole thing. So, I won't give the ending away nor the most interesting parts of the film but I will say that Natalie's work in her character is AMAZING and BRILLIANT wheter people find the movie good or not. And I'm saying this because in the story she just won't let me peek on the reality that Nina was living until the end. When an actor/actress is able to hide that in such a sutile way in the work they do on films THAT'S what I call brilliant!<br /><br />The movie is dark indeed and is not suited for all kind of people. Even Natalie Portman's fans might find this movie weird and disturbing. I personally found it brilliant and real within the life and situations that a professional ballerina might face (not all of them, I must clarify). Now, before I wrap up this review I want to share with you a personal experience I lived with the movie. I watched it on a Saturday afternoon in my brothers' bedroom. By the time the movie was over (and I must point out that the very last scene remained tattoed on my mind not to mention Nina's life style as well) I stood up off my chair, went to my room and I sat down in front of my keyboard and two hours later a song was born. I came up with it and it's called \\"Of lights and shadows\\" that reflects Nina's life in the lyrics. A week later I recorded the song with my band and now I play it on my IPOD too often and everytime I listen to it it reminds me to Nina and that very last scene after all she went through. To me, the fact that Natalie's work here inspire me to compose that song was the best proof that this movie is brilliant.e me to compose that song was the best proof that this movie is brilliant.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|I read the Lincoln Lawyer and then Firth Witness, and thoroughly enjoyed both books.  They certainly were page-turners.  So, I figured I'd invest 8 bucks in the Bosch character.  Unfortunately, the book doesn't \\"grip you by the throat\\" in the first few chapters to encourage you to continue reading.  It was slow and full of details that didn't do much to support the story.  Checking my Kindle often it wasn't until I was well into 30% of the book before it became a good read.  I enjoyed the last 65% of the book.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I haven't seen the movie yet. I've only seen the trailer and it blew me away! I've seen other Zack Snyder movies and I believe he'd have some sort of reason to make this one. THAT reason, no matter how weak, is enough for me. I'll be enjoying my @$$ off watching this on Blu-ray and a 63\\" Plasma HDTV. I'm a SUCKER for this kind of movie. There, I said it.   ;-)

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|A wonderfully hysterical funny movie.  Highly recommend to anyone who loves comedy at its best.  I can guarantee you will not stop laughing from  beginning to end.  We've watched it 3 times since it arrived.  Our friends all love it too.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|Escapism now has a new meaning.  Sanctum, produced by James Cameron and his team of cave diving enthusiasts, is anything but.  While based on a real life, nearly fatal experience, Sanctum is marvelous.<br /><br />Like westerns filmed in Death Valley, the old Iverson Ranch, or up near Ranger Rock, Sanctum comes to life in the depths of the cave environment.  I did not see it in 3D, so I cannot judge the cinematography, but on a regular TV, it was amazing.  The sheer beauty, the sheer awesomeness of the caves, the close quarters, and the ugly side of deep sea diving is inspiring.<br /><br />Filmwise, I can certainly say that I would not want to be faced with the decisions that Josh and his father made.  Mind you, this is truly, a life or death situation.  Do you bring someone through the caves (who is certain to die), and will most certainly cause your death?  Whose life is important?<br /><br />This is a film that begs the question, a film that could easily be about a group of people starving on a island without food (except each other), or a shipful of people floating on an ocean waiting for rescue.<br /><br />This is not an action film, this is a film about life, death and how we deal with our decisions.<br /><br />I loved it.
0525422943|5.0|I love this book!! you can feel almost everything Adam is feeling just like when you read If i stay... someone ask me if you can read this one without reading If i stay... I think you could but you wont feel it. I think you wont understand Mia's actions. With If i stay i read all the book with a hole in my chest its soooo sad and the end dont stop that sadness. With the end of Where she went you finally have some peace. I just love it.

0553381695|5.0|A Clash of Kings is the follow-up to A Game of Thrones and the second of a projected seven books in the Song of Ice and Fire series (upon which HBO's Game of Thrones is based).  Following the events of the first book, as many as five different kings are vying for the iron throne.  Needless to say, the political situation dramatically changes again over the course of the book, and the series adds to the already impressive body count from A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Martin remains a master of suspense, and your ability to put the book down will dissolve little over half-way through..  In a change from the first book of the series, Martin begins to let major events happen off-screen (albeit at least once for plot purposes).  Martin also gives much more background about the world that he has created in this book (thankfully in a adept way that avoids the dreaded info dump).  Magic plays a larger role in A Clash of Kings than in A Game of Thrones, which may be expected, as it is hinted that the erosion of magic in Martin's world was linked to the apparent extinction of the dragons.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings sags a bit in comparison with its predecessor and successor, but it is still an extremely good book.
0060776757|4.0|I agree with all of the reviews I have read. The information in this book is amazing and brings an intimate knowledge of how the band came to be and continues to evolve. Their core values and friendship are what has kept them on the top for so long. However, the size of the book and the \\"edgy\\" layout makes it hard to read. Colored, shiny pages are difficult to read. Please remember that those of us that have been along for the ride since the beginning have older eyes!!  This would be an amazing book on tape in their own voices!!!
B002PDBA90|5.0|At the 8:19 mark of Phase 1, Steve takes off into this aura of guitar madness that is unequaled in my opinion.  And he keeps it up for a solid 2-1/2 minutes.  I have listened to that section over and over and I feel in some ways I have gone insane.  How is it possible that he could have penned this?    I was brought up in the world of classical music loving the likes of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and the likes.  When I got older I learned through my brother of a band called Pink Floyd.  Wow.  I was fortunate to listen to today's Mozart.  Then I accidentally came upon Porcupine Tree while listening to a progressive rock station.  Man, where in the world did this come from?  Again, I feel fortunate to listen to today's Beethoven.    I maybe over the top in my analysis, but Steve's music (all of his music) is in my opinion timeless, hence classical.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|From the moment I started reading til I finished in the early morning hours I was hooked.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!! There were times when I wanted to smack Abby in the head for being overly dramatic and oblivious but I couldn't put it down. This is my first story by Jamie McGuire but it won't be my last. I will highly recommend this to anyone looking for a funny, not your normal romance story.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|An excellent movie, strongly recommended.  Do not really understand those who criticize the action part of it - it is true that the second half is a full-blown action movie but it works really well in the context of everything preceding.  The movie was never going to be a cerebral sci-fi so what's the actual problem with it?    The story is a bit simple but is marvelously directed with numerous details ornamenting that simple scenario.  That said, although the story can be said in a couple of lines, various intrusions, such as the unruly `Nigerians', or the `commentators' make it all very entertaining.   The last half an hour is indeed a vicious battle with strong references to robocap or iron man but I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.  There is some sort of nervousness, unsettling, and fast pace all along the movie which is fantastically reflected in how the movie is shot and through the lead actor (Sharito Copley) - that guy's chattiness, jerking actions, and well-suited appearance carry the movie extremely well.   Sharito is `real good' in District 9.  As well as the aliens, altogether with their mothership that mystically hovers above Johannesburg.   Beautiful special effects, the aliens are totally real and shrewdly put among the humans.   I would also like to commend the `Nigerians boss', not much onscreen but quite an interesting role.  The use of accent excellent.  District 9 concept is another strong point of the movie.  Misery, crime, lawlessness, violence and desperation echo very well with what one perhaps really finds in some slums somewhere.  The key point is that that sour place is chosen to accommodate and (apparently) implicitly destroy the aliens which makes it all bizarrely entertaining and fits perfectly into the whole concept.  The key credit goes to the director (Neill Blomkamp) for certainly the best sci-fi, entertaining action in last several years.  A right movie for adults as opposed to the incessant flurry of commercial sci-fi (actions) serving general population with the sole purpose of burgeoning the producer's bank account (and promoting the technical know-how).
B00006AW2M|5.0|The album has its excesses and its silly moments but its consistently interesting and often rocks really hard.  One of my top three Stones albums.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I waited a while to review this - I've been using the shield for over a year now.  Initially I absolutely loved it.  Like other reviewers have stated, putting it on is a bit of a process (you have to use a wet spray), but unlike stick-on screen protectors you don't always have that one piece of dust that gets under there and ruins the thing forever.  With the spray, if you have any dust underneath you can squeegee it out and still have a 100% perfect initial application (which I never, ever managed with a stick-on protector, despite cleaning my office like a surgical suite)    It is stickier/tackier then other screen protectors.  More so at first, but it will always have a bit of give.  It's a softer plastic than other screen protectors - this is exactly what makes it scratch-proof.  You can dig a fingernail into it.    Scratch-proof!  Yes 100%.  No problem whatsoever with keys, change, drops, whatever.      BUT - it peels.  really badly.  It's tacky/sticky on the outside and will grab things like change and credit cards in your pocket and drop them on the floor when you get your phone out.  It also grabs the sides of your pocket/bag when you drop it in and, for me, this is where the peeling happens.  I'm on my third shield now.  Once a corner peels, it quickly grabs dirt and keeps peeling.      Also, ZAGG does have a lifetime warranty and WILL replace a shield for any reason - BUT you have to pay a $7 shipping fee for your replacement AND you have to send back the old shield at your own cost.  My two replacements have also both had obvious defects. It's a personal anecdote, but I do wonder if the replacements are the almost-quality-control-failures.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|The names Paulson, Greenspan and Bernanke are among the many that have been become household names over more recent years. Even if you have no interest in finance or world events you could not have escaped knowing something about these three. Most often associated with financial oversight and authority, these men have been at the helm during the most turbulent years. So it's not unusual that a documentary about the global financial crisis (GFC) should feature them.    \\"Inside Job\\" is not your ordinary DVD. Sure it's rated due to \\"sexual references\\", albeit in the context of the apparent behaviour that prevailed over the years. There's no murder, no need for a CSI type investigation but in itself \\"Inside Job\\" is a forensic investigation.    But back to the names, Paulson was the former US treasury secretary and also former CEO of Goldman Sachs, a huge US investment house. In early 2008 Paulson said \\"If you're growing, you're not in recession ... right?\\"  Months later the bubble burst and even today the world is recovering from the catastrophic fallout from the collapse of investment houses, banks and even the economies of several countries.    It is ironical that the film directed by Charles Ferguson is narrated by actor Matt Damon. Years earlier Damon starred as Frank Abagnale Jr in \\"Catch me if you can\\". Yet Damon calmly provides the narrative that is supported by numerous interviews, mainly of people who either sounded the warnings or who have the credibility to comment. It is not surprising that a number of the high profile key players in the GFC \\"declined to be interviewed\\".    Hindsight is great and when you see and hear the way the whole pack of cards tumbled you have to ask yourself why? This film is essential viewing and provides a permanent reminder of the events and the people involved. The lessons of Enron have not been learned. Whether there was corruption, complicity or outright fraud can be decided as the story unfolds. The trouble is many people havesuffered and it will take the world a long time to recover.    If you had any unanswered questions about the GFC before today, then by the end of the film hopefully they'll be answered. Clearly the 2011 Academy Award for Best Documentary is justified.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Right off the bat, I see all the accessories needed to clean and attach my screen protector are included and I'm happy. I generally prefer screen protectors like BestSkinsEver, but this one will do. And since the clear case comes around the edges more than most cases I've seen , it helps prevent the edges of the screen protector from coming up.<br /><br />I like that the case is clear enough to see the phone through it. It's a pretty basic case, but very decent-looking. Protection-wise, it's great. The plastic is flexible, but firm. I drop my phone about once a week, and these types of cases really save my butt. Since the case wraps around the front a little, too, it protects the front glass screens from drops as well. The fit is absolutely perfect, unlike some other cheaper cases I've bought on Amazon.com. It's a little bit of a struggle to get the case on (tight fit and firmer, but flexible plastic), but it's snug and I like that.<br /><br />I have noticed that when taking a pic at night, the clear case seems to interfere with the flash. Not a big deal since I almost never use the flash.<br /><br />I also don't like that the back of the case has an \\"Amazon basics\\" logo imprinted on it. I would have preferred the logo be embossed into the plastic instead of screen printed on. It looks kinda tacky.<br /><br />For the cost, this is a great case!

0618001905|5.0|This is a superlatively researched and written book. King Leopold II was a constitutional Monarch (more or less). He felt little Belgium needed colonies, and he deserved greater wealth. However, there was little available land for colonization. Most areas had beeen gobbled up by Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and The Netherlands. Still available was the vast, mostly unknown Congo Basin in the heart of Africa. So Leopold set out to acquire the land, eventually called Congo Free State. Now let us summarize some of the characters, good and bad, who played key roles in colonizing and running the state. First coming to mind is Henry Morton Stanley,born poor and a Welsh bastard. who clawed his way to power and wealth. Stanley was a cruel and ruthles task master who played a dominant role in founding the Congo Free State {a far cry from \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume!\\"}. Ivory and rubber (from a jungle vine} were the initial source of Leopold's wealth, with minerals and timber playining important later roles. Leaders of work crews often worked Congolese to death, and punishments included cutting off the hands, feet, and heads of the natives. One administrator placed human heads atop fences around his garden. Gradually these atrocities became known to outsiders. Rogen Casement, knighted and an Irish patriot was later accused of treason and hanged in London's Pentonville Prison. Emund Dene Morel, who also spent years trying to improve the lot of the Congoles, was jailed for antiwar activities. Outside pressure eventually forced Leopold to relinguish the Congo Free State, which became the Belgian Congo. Leopold, however, continued to extract further riches, that he spent building monuments and palaces--and on his tenage mistress, now ennobled. Germany invaded Belgium in WWI. Then for several decades, the Belgian Congo enjoyed relative tranquility. But the country sought and got independence. Unfortunately, the first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, was a leftist, inviting assassination approved by the Western Powers. A thug named Mobutu Sese Seko, who disliked Communism, then looted the country for a couple more decades. Beyond the scope of this book, the Hutu genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda spilled over into the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. This land of lakes, volcanoes, and mountain gorillas is one of the loveliest in Africa. I've been there twice. Some tourist dollars are now comong in, but murder, rapes, and looting once again are dominant throughout much of the country. King Leopold's ghost still hovers over the Congo!

0679745203|1.0|Just finished reading the English Patient. I looked forward to reading it, and maybe it was turned into a good movie, but the book sure didn't hold my interest. The story was uninteresting, depressing, and unnecessarily drawn out. I was not drawn in to identify or care about the characters. I wasn't sure who was speaking at times, and after 50 pages I didn't care. The flashbacks were confusing and seemingly disconnected. No plot. No tangible mystery, though there was some which in its revealing toward the end of the story didn't matter to me. The story could have been told in half the amount of pages without all the unnecessary descriptive passages. It was a cold and godless kind of story from beginning to end.        This book struck me as the kind of novel that was put into a certain kind of prose that only some readers appreciate, and its style is probably embraced in a way that those readers laud as unique while smugly declaring that other readers did not appreciate it, thereby allowing themselves to feel better than others. The book was boring and taught me nothing about life except that it can be inhabited by some characters that appear to be stumbling along learning nothing of value except how to be despondent and confused.
0316067938|3.0|Alright.  So I agree that it wasn't the...best in the series.  But I'm truly surprised by the lack of positive reviews.  Yeah, they're there.  But what's with all the reviews declaring this to be a horrible book?    I gave this book three stars because it means I take a very neutral stance.  There was a lot going on in this book and it was difficult to process it all.  I'm sure the author had the same dilemma.  There were a lot of things that I really liked about the book.  There were a lot of things I hated about the book.  But I didn't hate the book completely.    The whole pregnancy thing enhanced the book.  This was a huge controversy for many readers, a fact I find to be very amusing.  If this had been left out, fans would have been cramming for this type of drama.  It was also more than just satisfying the fans.  It helped to understand Bella, Edward and amazingly Rosalie.  It bonded characters, it caused satisfying conflicts.  In this aspect I say the author did well.    The part that I'm really disappointed about is Jacob's entire demeanor.  This is not the Jacob we know and love.  He completely represses his emotions and when he doesn't he's always angry.  One reason I've always liked Jacob is that he's understanding to any situation.  He's sensitive!  He has a lot to be mad about, but that's hardly an excuse for the way he acts.      The conclusion of the series was incredible.  She did a very good job ending the books.  It was sudden, but it was time.      To finish, I want to thank Miss Stephenie Meyer for such an incredible saga.
1594202710|5.0|I have decided to buy this book by Dr. Henry  Kissinger to whom, I believe, is a always a  friend of China. This is not a review but to state the truth  about China and the Chinese people! China today stands at the crossroad and is ready to make friends with everybody provided it is respected in turn. In the past, the West has not understood China and always treat it with disrespect and worst still with full hostility and animosity and still is...! China has a continuous historical civilization of more than four thousand years. Although the regime change is quite rapid but the Chinese themselves are confident in facing the world today. The Chinese in China and all over the world have collectively learn a painful lesson in the past by not knowing well  their origins, their history, their culture and their unique civilization. But these are going to change as more Chinese understand and  support China and even its present  government and political concept. Time will tell whether the present political system will survive. But one thing is for sure, we the Chinese people today stand proud and tall and ready to meet any challenge from within and  without! We are proud of our civilization and our culture which have even  been copied and adapted by other countries - notably its ancient system of government and military strategies, its martial arts systems, its written language, its poetry and art, food and drinks  and calligraphy and even its fantastic literature which have been translated into many foreign  languages. China and the Chinese people will continue to evolve socially, politically and militarily. The fact that China has reached the superpower status is due to the determination, innovativeness and going back to study its historical concepts to be ready to advance economically and militarily into the future. Chinese people have these following concepts handed down through history...loyalty, dedication, determination and defense of the nation. Never again will ournation be weak, divided nor allowed ways for it to be invaded. We are able and capable of defending our nation but we will not be a \\"threat\\" nor be a \\"hegemon\\"  to any other nations. We will treat each country as equal and all we ask is for them not to interfere in our internal affairs nor remain hostile nor gang up on us. We stand in solidarity to support our nation through thick and thin and through learning  from the past painful history of factionism and division. These negative factors will not happen again. Finally, the sun will never, never set on our our people, our nation called Zhong Kuo or Middle Kingdom (known in the West as China). We hope other people will respect us as we would respect them in return  and we have a long memory in remembering who are definitely our friends and who are our foes...! Hence, we regard Dr. Henry Kissinger and President Nixon as our dear friends for opening up China to the world. Need I, a proud Chinese, say more??? Thanks and this is my two-cent worth of personal opinion on my ancestral homeland of CHINA.....Cheers!
1423101499|5.0|Classic!    The book, like the previous, is witty, original and hilarious.  This book is quick and has a lot more twists and turns then the previous books have.  There wasn't one moment that I wasn't interested. It keeps you on your toes.    As for if there is anything wrong with the books, I have little to say.  The book lacked only a little elaboration in certain aspects.  A conflict would be resolved and there were a couple that I was a bit confused at.      In all this book is one of the best in the series.  Do not miss this one!
B000FBFN1U|2.0|I had to stop reading this book (and the series) because the author simply spends too much time describing Gregor's rape campaign.  Enough already, he's a bad dude ~ we get it ~ move on!  I mean in the entire Malazan series (10 000 pages and counting) there is just 1 incidence of rape and it's only mentioned obliquely moreto explain a change to her character.  Quite simply it's gross and very off putting.  I won't waste any more of my money.  Plus the books are too damn slow with too many storylines.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|This edition is the first i have ever read, im sure there are better ones out there. However i enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was a little hard to understand the text as im not used to way things were written back then, but overall it was a very good read.
0061537969|5.0|If you're a dog lover - and even if you're not - you'll find yourself on an emotional roller coaster when you read this book. I never thought I would enjoy a novel written from the point of view of an animal, but I must say this one drew me in and kept me interested until the very last page. Stock up on Kleenex before you start reading.
0385732554|5.0|I love books about a dysopian society, and this may be one of my favorite books next to Hunger Games.  This book is thought provoking and shows what can go wrong when a Society strives to make everything the same, without any hurt, loss, and tries to protect a human being from everything including the good and the bad experiences in life.  I truly LOVE this book. It's not long, but the words the author uses are so powerful and commanding.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially those who love books about the future.  It shows the importance of giving people the freedom to make their own choices, even if those choices sometimes cause pain or maybe the wrong choices.  At least they have freedom.
0316098329|3.0|After hearing from a friend how wonderful this book was, I couldn't wait to read it. Well, I guess my expectations were too high because I was not as thrilled with the book as other people seem to be. The author did do a good job of telling the story through the eyes of five-year-old Jack, however, I found the story itself lacking. Without giving away spoilers, I can just say that I lost interest in the book and put it down several times before finishing it. Obviously, I'm in the minority though, so if you don't need a lot of action or a thrilling plot to keep you interested, then give this book a try.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Downloaded this onto my Xoom.  It works great, runs as smooth as butter...except, strangely, when I pick up the new seed at the end of the level.  It slows down a tad(works fine when there are several dozen zombies on the screen).  I haven't loaded it on my DX yet.
B003ELOQCA|5.0|As my brittish firneds would say: bloddy brilliant!<br /><br />360 is a one of the most powerful concerts from what should be the best band in the world. The concert plays music from 5 decades of solid hits, is visually delicious and the music is superb. I especially liked the re-mix of I'll go Crazy Tonight with cuban rythms, its fantastic.<br /><br />Watching the video reminded me of the times I saw U2 live in concert. It is an experience. There is no other concert like this. A must have for any U2 fan and for anyone who appreciates good rock music.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|I hestitated buyinng ZBB's latest studio album because I was in love with \\"Pass the Jar\\" and it included several live versions of songs from this album.  My wife and I have fallen in love with ZBB after wearing out the live album but I didn't jump on this album's band wagon for some time because I'm just not a fan of studio albums. Now I'm regretting waiting so long. There isn't a song on this album that I skip over when driving down the road or listening in my office.  Each song has me singing at the top of my lungs (to the dismay of my coworkers.)      And if you haven't caught these guys in concert do it now.  We drove 2 hours to see them at the end of May and I would do it again at the drop of a hat. Their stage presence is AMAZING.
B00005JO20|2.0|With Jack Black, everything plays like a comedy, a parody. He is forever arching his eyebrows and bugging his eyes, foreshadowing the evil about to hit. I'm not sure that was the intention. It makes this third version of Kong the most hokey by far. Also, the movie is a real drag until Skull Island, and that's about 45 minutes in, way too long to wait for the action to start. Most of the movie looks like digital special effects. Was anything real at all? The end is agonizing, but not in a good way. This should have been cut to two hours or less.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This was the first Breaking Benjamin CD I bought, and I enjoyed it so much that I got all three of their other albums. I love all of the songs on this CD, and listen to them almost every day. I hope Breaking Benjamin continues to make great music in the future!
0142410322|4.0|Charlie Bucket, the new owner Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, is joined by Willy Wonka, his parents and his grandparents in an epic adventure through the stars on board a giant glass elevator.  Accidentally rocketed into space by the interference of his grandmother, Charlie and his companions get the chance to visit the first space hotel, fight off vermicious Knids and save the world!<br /><br />I am never ever disappointed by a Roald Dahl book.  Full of wonderfully imaginative language (\\"What in the nebuchadnezzar!\\") and interesting characters (like Vice President Tibbs, President Gillywater's old nanny), the books always remind me of an important fact, reiterated by Willy Wonka himself:  \\"A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.\\"  I certainly enjoyed this little bit of nonsense!

B004XIQDYW|5.0|Even though it doesn't reach the greatness of their debut album (not many albums do), it's still their best album since. It's certainly their most \\"poppy\\" album to date, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The people that complain about their change in sound, are probably the same nimrods that would have whined about Revolver or Led Zeppelin III. They have grown and matured, and it shows. Also, the title, Suck It and See, is a british expression which basically means give it a try.    Stand outs include, Black Treacle, The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala, That's Where You're Wrong, and my personal fave, Reckless Serenade (the bassline is killer). It has some solid rockers in All My Own Stunts and Brick by Brick, which gets a bad rap because it's repetitive, but hey so were early Beatles songs! It doesn't have any particularly poor tracks, though it's definitely not a perfect album, as Love Is a Laserquest and Piledriver Waltz (lyrically great though) drag just a bit, and Library Pictures is a bit chaotic. Overall it's a very strong album, which I would describe as a combination of the lighter Cornerstone and the darker rest of Humbug.    Since this is a review of the vinyl version, I should add that my vinyl was pressed well, with not many pops and cracks. Also, it is highly recommended that you buy the vinyl, since you get a free download code, which you can burn onto a CD.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|(Spoiler) The entire film takes place in the confines of a crude wooden coffin, so it takes remarkable direction and script-writing to keep an audience focused with such a  limited location.  It is pulled off very well.  The sign of any good movie is one that you cannot stop watching, and we were glued to our seats the whole time.  There's some who wont like it:  Those who are claustrophobic, and those with forward-sloping foreheads who need constant explosions and special effects to stay entertained.  Anyway, I think most will like it.
0356500535|3.0|I was prepared to love this story. A great story needs an imaginative world, memorable, well-defined characters, and an impactful ending. Unfortunately, The Windup Girl only scores 2 out of 3 here. The world of future Bangkok is vivid to the point of feeling the oppressive humidity on every page, while the characters are diverse and real. The story follows an imaginative trajectory, even if some situations became repetitive and predictable along the way. (Minor spoiler: one character cannot stick their head outside without bad things happening virtually every time). The failure I found in The Windup Girl, was in its ending, which seemed chaotic, haphazard, unjustified by what had come before, and just outright random - as though the author just threw in the kitchen sink at the end. The author does acknowledge in the Acknowledgements that he needed help in bringing his story to a conclusion. I think he needed rather more help than he received. But the first 90% is great Science Fiction.

0393338827|1.0|First of all I love all of Michael Lewis's books prior to this one but his decision to make Meredith Whitney some kind of hero when in reality everyone on Wall Street knows she is really a boob was something I could not stomach.  First of all a surprising number of analysts were making a very similar call as Meredith at the time.  Second Meredith is not a great thinker (see her recent muni default call which she is back tracking from as we speak) and people in the know know that anything innovative Meredith came up with was from her relationship with the arguably brilliant Steve eisman who used to work at her shop and left to join front point partners hedge fund and absolutely crushed it on the short side during the 2008 implosion.  Perhaps this is an unfair review but Lewis's ill-informed decision to select Whitney as the hero was frankly a joke and called into question the entire book for me.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Emma Thompson has got a lot to answer for, what with her first juking the world with her \\"Erm, I say, I may have the cure for cancer\\" revelation, except that her vaccine instead transforms most of the world's populace into savage zombie creatures. This makes it a rather monumental oopsie. Anyway, that's it for Emma Thompson, whose early cameo establishes the post-apocalyptic premise. She's never seen again in this film. But she's done enough.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is the third film adapting Richard Matheson's classic horror story, although, far as I'm concerned, no one yet's come close to doing justice to the novel. In terms of how it stacks up against the previous two adaptations, I prefer I AM LEGEND over THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston) but not over THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with a fantastic Vincent Price). Will Smith's performance is top notch. Respecting the bleak tone of the movie, Smith stays away from his trademark touches of humor. Instead, Smith delivers one of his strongest performances, plays up his terrific knack for garnering the movie audiences' sympathy. With expressions of despair and horror perpetually etched on his features, Smith humanizes the hell out of his character.<br /><br />Films like this underscore just how fragile and ephemeral society can be. You topple the infrastructure and break society's contract, and where are we? A palpable sense of desolation, this disquieting thing, shoots thru you as you take in scenes of a deserted New York City. The story picks up there three years after Emma Thompson's cataclysmic bungle. We meet virologist Dr. Robert Neville, the city's (and maybe the world's) last surviving human - as he and his dog Sam tool around the empty, weedy streets in a sports car. In the intervening years - or, as I'm wont to call it, the Post-Emma Thompson Age - Neville has grown strange and a bit mad. Loneliness will do that, and as well that nagging sense that you may be the last left of your kind. Neville, who is immune to the monster-making virus, has never stopped his efforts to unearth a cure, conducting experiments in his basement laboratory. Every day he wakes up and goes about his daily routine. H exercises. He frequents the local video store (in which he'll socialize with mannequins he'd clothed). When the sun reaches its zenith, he waits at the sea port hoping against hope to rendezvous with other survivors. He occasionally hunts for game (wild life, CG-rendered, now dot the cityscape). He's home before dark, barricading his sunlit house with heavy steel shutters. And, after dark, the monsters come out. Maybe the film's most harrowing moment, and the most heartbreaking, is when we glimpse Neville, weapon in hand, and his dog Sam cowering in the bathtub as terrible noises from the outside bombard their ears. The fear is palpable.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville has been in a rut, and it takes two game-changing events to flip the scenario. The first event shatters his spirits. The second one heralds the arrival of a woman named Anna (the gorgeous Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan, both of whom have listened to Neville's recorded daily radio brodasts and decided to take a chance. At this juncture, Will Smith's acting chops come into play again as his character demonstrates the jarring awkwardness and confusion one goes thru when introduced to company after having been alone for so long. Anna and Ethan serve to regalvanize the plot, toss it down a new direction.<br /><br />The zombies - or Dark Seekers - up the jeopardy by proving to have more game than just skittering around, biting human flesh. One particular zombie exhibits a measure of cunning and, in fact, turns the tables on Neville, and does this in a deliberately ironic way. The one knock against these zombies is that the CG rendering is just a hair off. The film's third act, in fact, is just a hair off as things degenerate into a series of garden variety action sets. Still, for what Will Smith brings to the table andfor several impactful scenes which really resonate, I AM LEGEND is worth your time.<br /><br />In the \\"Ain't Nepotism Grand?\\" Department, Will Smith's real life daughter, Willow, plays Neville's daughter in all those flashbacks.for several impactful scenes which really resonate, I AM LEGEND is worth your time.<br /><br />In the \\"Ain't Nepotism Grand?\\" Department, Will Smith's real life daughter, Willow, plays Neville's daughter in all those flashbacks.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|If you are looking for a good, basic case for your iPhone 4 - this is a good bet.  There is nothing flashy about it at all, but it does work well.  The included screen protector went on easily. I had no trouble following the directions or getting the little air bubbles out.      The case itself adds nice protection to the phone and adds a bit of grip to it.      Another plus for the case it that it comes off easily.  When I want to put my phone in a docking station its not much work at all to pop the phone out.   Only thing that would be better is if I could keep the case on - but I realize that's just not possible with any case that offers bump protection.      All and all its a good, basic protective cover.

B004P52NP6|3.0|This album is pleasant enough if you are a dedicated Whitesnake fan, and can get past the sound of Coverdale's voice now.  The real question to me is why buy this?  There is so much great music out there, and surely everyone has limited dollars to spend.  In that context I question if this album really delivers.  I doubt if I will be listening to it a year from now.  All it made me do was reach back into the Whitesnake catalog and listen to their early stuff, which was much stronger.  If you own the new remastered versions of Lovehunter, Come An' Get It, or Ready An' Willing, then go ahead and buy this.  If not, one of these albums will be a much more rewarding investment.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a movie you rent or see and think \\"eh\\" and then you watch it and go \\"oh I love this movie!\\"  It's a cool modern fairy tale that you enjoy even if you don't have children.  It's modern in that there is a cross dressing pirate, but then again, it's refreshing in the inclusion not forced.  The ghosts bring a comic element, making it suitable for younger children than you might think.  People knock each other off, but the ghost of the recently murdered hang around to see what's going on.  I didn't think I would like it, and heck after seeing it I love it.  I bought TWO copies, one copy for a friend that is in a long term care facility.  It's the kind of movie you can give someone to make them feel good.

6305079811|4.0|I give this 4 stars because of the laughs my family got from this unintentionally funny movie.  It must have been filmed with the lowest budget of most any other film.  The acting, scenery, dialog, etc. are so hilarious you won't be able to keep a straight face.  I recommend buying this if you want a darn good laugh, not if you're looking for drama.  It's best if watched with a group - the laughs will just keep on coming!
B004IFYMWK|3.0|Naomi Watts plays Valerie Plame and Sean Penn is starring next to her in a role of Joe Wilson, former Ambassador and Valerie's husband.  There is not a person that has not heard of Ms. Plame who was no ordinary ambassador's wife, working professional and a mother, but rather a CIA agent with very good looks.  Her story is unprescedented in a sense that her husband's outspoken nature caused the US high level officials to reveal her identity as a CIA covert agent and directly put in danger not only her family, but also the contacts she groomed in 18 years of her career as a CIA agent.<br /><br />I have not read the book, but I did follow the events regarding this political scandal.  In any case, I enjoyed the portrayal of Joe Wilson a man of strong convictions who is standing his ground and defending his ideals.  It is not often one seems a middle aged man, with family, standing his ground when it comes to his political ideas.  I do not believe that Joe Wilson ever believed that government officials would take their anger and disapproval of his conduct so harshly to destroy both of their careers and almost their marriage.  In a movie,  Penn portrays Wilson as a wise and rational man and I must admit I am less impresed with Plame's character (not Watt's performance though).  I found Plame to be naive and even silly at times and her take that her job \\"pays the bills\\" did not convince me of undying loyalty to either country, or her family for that matter.  After watching the movie both issues almost seem like a fallback after she lost it all.  Movie is an interesting observation of our society of today, marital loyalties and loyalties towards political beliefs and ambitions.
B003UESJEM|5.0|THE COMPANY MEN is very difficult to watch if you are among the millions of people who have been laid off by the current economic recession/meltdown in this country. Writer/Director John Wells understands the grave aspects of losing a job as corporations and businesses downsize in response to the current economic disaster - depression, humiliation, loss of self-worth and pride, fear of failure in finding new employment, the effects of job loss on marriages and families, loss of hope - it is all here in this very well made film. If the first part of the film causes a reactive tachycardia and an urge to simply stop watching the story, then the closing moments of the film bring at least a little redemption in the faith that man can actually survive and reassess and stop being a victim of a situation over which few of us have any control.<br /><br />GTX is a shipbuilding empire in Boston, the brainchild of Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) who brought a simple ship building business to a wealthy corporation now run by CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson): McClary is a billionaire with a wife  concerned with shopping sprees using the corporate jet and a lover Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello), the HR director of the corporation. The year is 2008 and the stock market and the economy in general have dipped to a new low and terrifying point. The result: downsizing and one of the first to go is sales manager Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) who is shocked and then hurt and then overcome with a feeling of failure and humiliation.  Bobby's wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) at first responds with desperation but adjusts by taking on work as an ER nurse, coaxing their son to not lose hope in Bobby.  Bobby tries to find work but is the victim of the joblessness of the country: he finally accepts Maggie's brother Jack's (Kevin Costner) offer to to work as a simple carpenter.  Meanwhile the downsizing includes Gene and longterm employee Phil (Chris Cooper) who is overcome with anger and humiliation at being unemployable because of his advanced age.  The manner in which each of these three men cope with the loss of job and income weaves a story that is complete with tragedy as well as  a demonstration of the indomitability of the human spirit.<br /><br />THE COMPANY MEN  contains many messages about coping with change, preparing for a realistic financial future, and the delicate line that separates each day's stance on the tightrope of existence.  While the story is difficult to watch, the performances by this exceptional cast are excellent, not only among the Oscar winning stars but by the finely wrought cameos by Anthony O'Leary as Bobby's son Drew, Cady Huffman, and Eamonn Walker (so well remembered from the TV series OZ), among many others.<br /><br />This is tough medicine but necessary views on contemporary society.

1591843790|5.0|I came across the name \\"Guy Kawasaki\\" for the first time in 1998 when I read the German version of his book \\"How to drive your competition crazy\\". I absolutely loved it! I was very eager to read his latest book release \\"Enchantment - The Art of changing hearts, minds and actions\\". Let me share with you the 7 things I loved in Guy Kawasaki's latest book release \\"Enchantment\\":     1.) The personal stories. People are very much interested in knowing other peoples' experiences. Something we can learn a lot from. It was a great idea to include these stories, without them this book would not have been the same. My 4 personal favourite stories were from Mike Stevens, Matt Maurer, Richard Fawal and Chris Anthony.      2.) The chapter \\"How to achieve likeability\\" and more thoughts on \\"swearing\\", a topic you usually don't read a lot about.    3.) How other people and companies approach certain things differently, eg. Zappos, Neile McQueen Toffel (Steve McQueen's first wife), Amazon etc.     4.) The results of many research projects and experiments that have been shared.     5.) The 20-question-quiz (at the end) to check how much you remember from reading his book. It reminded me of taking a course. I found it a great idea!     6.) The Coverphon as the very last story in his book. \\"Under the cover: How it took 260 people to make this cover.\\" It was highly interesting, again a real-life story! I thought more authors should include stories like this too when they are writing their own books.     7.) The great tips on how to enchant people online (via social media) and offline.  Just some things that you will learn (4 Qualities of a good positioning statement, how to draw a bright line between ethical and unethical activities, how to foster a heroic imagination, how to communicate in an easy manner, 3 reasons why a checklist is important, how to craft a story that does your cause justice, how to enable people to suspend disbelief, how to launch your cause, how to thrive in this new world, the 3 benefits from asking people to support you, how to illustrate the salient point, the importance of getting your first follower, tips on how to move people to action, methods to find a way to agree, 3 ways on how to handle competition, how to achieve trustworthiness and much more.....).
B004VFYPTW|4.0|I first just want to say that I am very excited that this show has finally been released.      I purchased the CD/DVD combo, and while the performance and audio quality are excellent, I'm not a huge fan of the video.  My problem is not with the video quality itself, since it's about what I expected given when it was shot and because it was not filmed for an official release.  The video does, however, look much better on my smaller 37\\" TV than it does on my 52\\" TV.  One thing that I do not like about the video is that it's comprised mostly of individual close-ups, with very few shots showing more than one band member at a time.  I'm guessing that this is because they had to use the video feeds that were displayed on the big screens during the actual concert, which are usually all close-up shots.  Some other annoying things about the video are that the video often changes from color to black & white, and there are several cheesy slo-mo effects used througout the video.    Even though I don't care much for the DVD, the CDs alone get 5 stars and make this is an excellent purchase for the price.  This concert will be getting a lot of play time in my CD player and on my iPod.
0061148512|4.0|Although I can't remember how long ago, I have read The Bell Jar before. Upon re-reading, I was surprised that I remembered absolutely nothing about it -- literally, not even the first thing. Anyway, it's good, although it's hard to separate the book on its own merits from the knowledge that it ultimately functions as a prologue to the tragedy of Plath's real life.  Plath was, at heart, more of a poet than a novelist, which is evident often enough in her prose. Her descriptions are lovely - and yes, at times, even poetic - and always minutely observed. She is also a sharp observer of human nature, the essence of which she can portray with a minimum of words.  Buddy Willard only requires a page or two before you understand just what he is, and the same can be said for many of the characters in the book. Buddy, with his conventional outlook, is part of the cause for the narrator's malaise, as she tries to figure out what she wants to be in the world, and opposes that to what the world wants her to be. Plath's book ends by offering us the chance to imagine a hopeful reconciliation for those possibilities. We take it, of course, and for a while in her life it appears that she did too, accomplishing what she wanted to be in the world, as well as a part of what the world wanted her to be. It didn't \\"stick\\" though, and if you don't know what happened next, you might want to pick up a biography when you put down The Bell Jar.

1400052181|4.0|This is easily the most enjoyable book I have read all year, and I won't be surprised if the year ends and I am still saying that. If you are disinclined to pick it up based on the arcane subject matter (it is, essentially, about the first line of human cells that was successfully kept alive in a laboratory), put those reservations aside. Skloot is writing not only about science, but also a riveting human interest narrative too. While detailing the science in a very clean and broadly accessible manner, she also looks into whose cells those originally were, which no one in the past had paid much attention to. In shades of Tuskegee, it turns out that the cells belonged to an African-American woman with a virulent version of cervical cancer, who never knew -- let alone gave consent -- what might be done with her cells. For many years, her descendents didn't know either, and the book talks about how they ultimately learned, and what has occurred in their lives before and since. Although the cells have become the basis of a billion dollar industry, the descendents have never earned the first cent from them, and in fact have spent much of their lives unable to even afford basic health insurance -- try writing about that without being righteously indignant. Yet Skloot does, astonishingly: to her immense credit, she writes what is often a hard and sad story without judgement or sentimentality. It is left to you, the reader, to be the judge, and I can't imagine how you would not deem this to be a completely riveting and deeply moving read.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I've been following The Walking Dead comic since its early days, and am very pleased to see that the television adaptation does justice to its source while finding its own voice and forging its own path.  The casting is strong, the creature effects are phenomenal, and the writing is tight.  I was thrilled by the first season and I'm very much looking forward to season 2 and beyond.<br /><br />Without dispute, cable is where the innovation in television is being done, especially in Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror.  Step up, network TV, or be left behind.

B001HN6918|5.0|It's not often that a sequel can outdo its predecessor, but in this case, it has occurred. This movie, however, is even more rare in its superiority over the first (which isn't by much, mind you), because the first was excellent, and it had a huge hurdle to overcome. Terminator was a movie that was exceptional in its own right. Along came Terminator 2, which literally blew the first out of the water. RARE.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't blow the first one out of the water, but, in my humble opinion, it was better. Why?<br /><br />1. The story was more involving, more captivating, more \\"root for the good guy\\" than the first.<br />2. The visual imagery was spectacular. Heads and tails better than the first.<br />3. The \\"cute and compassionate\\" factor that was prominent in the first was here again, but tenfold.<br />4. The voice acting in the first seemed a bit forced, like they (all but Jack Black), were trying to overcome some type of \\"uncomfortable\\" bug. The voice acting in 2 was spot-on. In the first, I found myself consciously listening to the actors doing voice-overs. In the second, I found myself listening to the characters and not paying any attention to the voice acting, as a whole, at all. It was as if everyone came to this movie knowing exactly what they wanted to do and what was expected of them in achieving their goals.<br /><br />Jack Black proves that he is an extremely talented voice actor. He hit all his marks and then some. Angelina Jolie as Tigress, who was terrible in the first movie, was at the top of her game in 2. Jackie Chan as Monkey was the only one who still seemed to be a bit out of place, but overall, he came out shining, as well.<br /><br />I'm not one for 3D movies either, but the only one showing at the time I had available was the 3D version, and it was phenomenal, perfectly executed.<br /><br />Five stars! *****

B0007DAZW8|5.0|I've been interested in electronic music for a little over a decade and have reviewed many different albums from many different acts. Recently I had a \\"hit review\\" with the Deadmau5 \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" CD. I was somewhat amazed, but it got a lot of votes and a ton of discussion. Amazon reviewer P. Harper remarked \\"Gary! Gotta go with Daft Punk!!\\" Well, OK. I'll try it. Daft Punk has been on my Amazon recommended list and this suggestion provided a little boost. I ended up buying four discs, the last of which is \\"Human After All.\\" The first CD, and the one that really sold me on Daft Punk was the \\"Alive 2007\\" album. It was just sensational, one of the best live albums I've ever heard from any genre of music.<br /><br />I just love listening to the \\"Alive 2007\\" disc. It's fun music and wonderfully melodic and the sound reproduction is marvelous. When I got the \\"Human After All\\" disc I immediately noticed that six of the contained songs were also on the \\"Alive 2007\\" CD. Hmmmmm. Maybe I should have paid more attention to the details. In any case. it was done and I put the CD on. I was very startled by the \\"Human After All\\" recording. The songs may have been somewhat similar to the \\"2007\\" versions, but the total atmospheric effect was drastically different and it took me a while to adjust. The \\"2007 Alive\\" versions were light and frolicking and joyous, and of course it had a large audience backup to add to the festivities. The \\"Human After All\\" versions were very stiff and robotic and repeated and repeated and repeated. The music sounded as if it might have been generated by some strange outer space aliens. Some of the lines were suitable for a large stadium concert and were repeated over and over. Marvelous lines, by the way. In any case, the music sounded not very human at all. But I liked it. I liked it a lot. It just had a totally different feel.<br /><br />So, if you like Daft Punk and enjoy these songs, which one do you pick. Well, I went with both and I've enjoyed both. But they have a drastically different feel. I'd have to give the nod to \\"Alive 2007,\\" perhaps because I like the live recording. In either case, it's excellent music!<br /><br />Gary PetersonBut they have a drastically different feel. I'd have to give the nod to \\"Alive 2007,\\" perhaps because I like the live recording.

0316056863|3.0|The last few years have given rise to a tremendous amount of female talent in comedy with no figure more prominent than Tina Fey. A graduate of Chicago's Second City comedy troupe, Fey became the first female head writer at Saturday Night Live and went on to create the critically adored show, 30 Rock. Long known to comedy nerds, it was with Fey's brief stint impersonating Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live during the 2008 election that Fey became the rarest breed in comedy: a household name. It's not surprising that the recognition and success came attached with the burden of being the poster child for the surge in female comedy heavy hitters and the go to example when unpacking the cultural and feminist subtexts of women in contemporary comedy. So it comes as little surprise that Fey would release a memoir as she cruises along her career's apogee.<br /><br />In concept, a Tina Fey memoir is extremely promising. She is, after all, a writer first and foremost, who's career has been built on increasingly witty and intelligent humor, so there's certainly promise for some interesting insights. Add to that the ceiling smashing trajectory of her career in what was (and probably still is) a major stronghold of idiotic machismo, and you've got yourself the makings of a really engaging read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Bossypants falls short of its potential. The fact that a fair amount of personal information and industry gossip is off limits is an admirable authorial decision, but there are Wikipedia entries more insightful than Fey's memoir. Burgeoning actors and comedians who will certainly buy, borrow, or steel a copy of Bossypants for insights into improv at Second City, or life as a SNL writer and cast member will be sorely disappointed. It's clear Fey looks back fondly on her lean years as a comedy novice, but it's unclear as to if these events truely carry little weight as their protrayal suggests, or if Ms. Fey's strengths as a writer don't extend to the narrative form.<br /><br />In all fairness, most readers picking up Bossypants are looking for a good laugh and, in that, respect Fey amply delivers. It's a light, fun, unfortunately innocuous read, but a welcome extention of Fey's comedic craft.airness, most readers picking up Bossypants are looking for a good laugh and, in that, respect Fey amply delivers.

B003ASLJKO|5.0|Have this in VHS , and now in DVD, One of their better movies, but then most of them are good.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|Forget about all the reviewers here who seem unable to set aside their politics long enough to provide an objective review of this movie. This film in IMAX 3D is absolutely gorgeous! The scenes have great depth to them and do an excellent job of drawing the viewer in and providing an immersive experience, which is what any good film is supposed to do...particularly a 3D film. Overall, I quite enjoyed this movie and the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because it is only 45 minutes long.     *I viewed this movie on my Samsung UN55D7000 LED TV.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Good movie.  Had a casual yet upbeat plot line.  Bradley Cooper  acts very well both in character and as the main character.  The  love story could have been explored a bit further, but the rest  of the movie was great.  It was kind of like a sequel to the movie  Wall Street along with a human touch.  Also there were nice creative  twists to keep the viewer glued to the movie.  The dialogue was   witty and well developed.  It also showed the human side of suffering  and relationships.  Also the lengths to which people will go to   succeed.  A movie worth seeing again.
B0043RSE2M|3.0|My review of this film is mostly based on the 3D quality of the movie. The movie itself is quite funny and can be appreciated by people of all ages. I viewed this movie on my Samsung UN55D7000 LED tv and was somewhat disappointed with the depth of most of the scenes in the film. There are far too few scenes where the images pop out of the screen as if they're going to smack you in the face. In my opinion, Megamind and Shrek 2 thru 4 have this movie beat hands down when it comes to the quality of the 3D visual effects.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I thought the movie was really good.  Also it was easy to understand,   not complicated and muddled like other movies.  The plot was well developed  and showed how even a married couple of lawyers can disagree fundamentally  on how the law should be applied and upon whom.  That way it was really  great.  The only flaw in the movie was when the criminal's mother is shown  also as a person willing to defend her son by doing criminal acts.  I thought  that was a bit far fetched that a rich upper class lady would be ready to get  into these kinds of activities herself.  That stretched the plot a bit too far.  And could have been handled differently.  The main actor played by Mathew  McCaunaghey was brilliantly acted and handled.  Which shows Mathews ability  to handle drama as well as romance movies.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|This product is for my '07 Scion tC. My iPhone 4 cannot be charged by Scion's iPod accessory kit. So, I tried several charging converters such as Scosche passPORT as well as dock extensions. Among them, the CableJive converter is best. In case of Scosche passPORT, it makes radio interference and sometimes error communication with car audio. In addition, its size is too long to fit Scion OEM cup holder organizer (without the converter, it fits perfectly). Dock extensions, gadget dock extension and another 6 ft dock extension ($30 at Amazon.com), also show error message whenever I turned on and off engine. However, this converter does not create radio interference, is the smallest part among them and is not easily fallen down.  So far, I do not have any problem.

0060179872|4.0|I was surprised about how the author bought off on the Kennedy  boiler plate on both RFK and JFK.   The author staked out the stink of the LAPD and FBI angles to his credit.

B0051QIGP4|2.0|after hearing born this way 10,000 times I thought it was pretty catchy and this cd might be worth checking out. I had a $1 credit to my amazon account and the cd was on sale for .99 and I figured it was a no-brainer. I was disappointed in the cd. I thought the only really good song was born this way and the rest were not ipod worthy. I guess I cant complain though since I actually didnt even pay for it.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Who ever said Gaga made good music is totally wrong! This album is just pure trash. Ever song is boring and really we all know she copied Britney Spears Femme Fatale album which a a brilliant album from Ms Spears. Gaga has copied the likes of Britney and Madonna in this album and to be honest all the songs sound the same and to me the songs are super boring and gaga this album is NOT the album of the Decade! If you want a good album then go and buy BRITNEY SPEARS: FEMME FATALE ALBUM.

031603441X|5.0|I am a huge music buff, and have started appreciating the Rolling Stones more and more as I get older. I always thought of Keith Richards as a drunken pirate, but this book changed that. Well, sort of. He tells a good tale. The book makes you feel like you're sitting around with Keith and he's telling you about his life over a few beers. He has a great memory. You soon learn that he is not as his persona makes him seem. He comes across as the most level headed and honest person in the group. He's got a great sense of humor. He even included cooking tips and a recipe for bangers and mash! This book was great. I highly recommend it.

Illud Divinum Insanus really is the St Anger of death metal, any of these respected death metal artists trying to \\"change\\" their sound needs to know this: we metalheads are not close minded, most of us listen to genres other than metal. But if you don't give us good riffs and you shove laughable lyrics into your songs, you are making crap music.

B004FOA84A|3.0|Got this app when it was free and was very pleased with it. Beautiful and a lot of fun since I'd been looking for a good mystery game for a while. But, like everyone else has been saying, it is a short game. The end does leave room for a possible follow-up, but alas, there has been nothing. I got so excited when I saw an update was available for it, promptly installed it, but nothing has changed. No new chapter, no part 2, no difference whatsoever except a tiny option change that now allows for FX volume adjustment in addition to music volume. I would love a real update to this game with more gameplay. Until then, only 3 stars.
0736083863|5.0|This book gives you the inside knowledge of what Pilates Exercises are accomplishing as per each muscle group. I believe it gives you more incentive to work out knowing this information. It doesn't mean that one needs to attain the knowledge of a physician in order to understand the general concepts. It helps you shape your workout to your needs, I believe. I have been doing Pilates for 3 months with a Personal Trainer and have seen the results but wanted to know more about the subject. I think one day I may become a personal trainer myself as I am very enthusiastic about Pilates. I have worked with weights all my life but I believe Pilates is easier on the joints and yet gives you very good results in muscle tone, balance, and that very famous 'core' strength. In summary, it you want to delve a little bit more into the philosophy of Pilates exercises and how they affect your muscles, and your muscle tone, this is an excellent book and easy to read, and has illustrations as well.

0394417887|5.0|For anyone who lived through the sixties, this should be in their personal library. Yes, it is about Vietnam, and yes, the language is often stunningly electric, but for time and place and for the character of that decade it is  indispensable. If you were a draft age male back then, caught on the wrong side of the deferment circus, Vietnam  aside, there is some one or some thing in this that touches on your own sense of identity as it was back then.  Of three prior paperback copies, I gave two away and the third fell apart.   If you can bear the unpleasantness it aims at you, read it. It's vulgar, rough, and always on the edge of losing  control. If you approach it anticipating some grand political oversight, forget it. In all their naked, vulgar, honorable misery, it reveres grunts. Those among us who can be counted upon when this world's dirty work needs doing.

B000000H3Z|5.0|Extracted almost purely from its riffs, Beneath the Remains focuses Sepultura's unforgiving sound into a clearer definition of speed metal in the extreme death-like style of Slayer. The structures have become more complex, featuring more involved instrumentation, yet the heads-down relentless aggression remains the result of unyielding explosive momentum. The unbridled sense of urgency makes little time for obscure forays into the foreboding doom of past efforts, those murky crawls of mysterious under-searching that seemingly arrested the speeding frenzy of violence in mid-song before the thrashing commenced to hammer the song to its conclusion; this time the sheer propulsion of an impulsive need to test the limits of an even more detailed and organized chaos in motion discharges an unstoppable surge of cataclysmic power.    \\"All Of Us Are Victims  Confined By Enigmas  Without Solution  Your Frozen Thoughts Don't Let You Evolve  A Prisoner Of Your Own Trap  Slaves Of An Infinite Pain  What Will Be The Limit?  What Will Be The End?\\"    Coming firmly into their own as master songwriters, Sepultura displays a distinct compositional framework of riff-defined development of theme through complex yet strikingly perceptive movements. The design is dictated by the shape of the riffs, with each riff a revelation of new knowledge or insight into a specific part of the conceptual observation. The riffs are the song, but the song as a whole manifests the unity of thought sourced in each riff, resulting in logical representations of ideas communicated in a most articulate yet deadly serious violence. This brilliant portrayal of structured turbulence defines each song in the band's most individually identifiable and mightiest collection.    Every song features a wealth of inventive riffing, powerful, unique, and crushingly rhythmic in pure ruthless motion, with amazingly fluid transitions, while bizarre solos consider the absurdity of a mad world with detail that further clarifies the raging creative chaos, at times mocking its own anger to expose the meaninglessness of human emotion to the universe. Vocals of a barking shout are rhythmically arranged according to riff, enhancing the music's forceful direction and expressive strength, an almost authoritative level of rage given a severe, commanding rhythmic platform by the fantastic drumming, which delivers inventive, frenzied beat-patterns in unrestrained speeding tempo, but also showing incredible skill in an almost intuitive sense of rhythmic anticipation and building towards eruptive acceleration.    \\"Walking These Dirty Streets  With Hate In My Mind  Feeling The Scorn Of The World  I Won't Follow Your Rules  Nonconformity In My Inner Self  Only I Guide My Inner Self\\"    This comprehensive expression of distress and desire, communicated in the voice of violent frustration, is awarded a clear, powerful sound of instrumental clarity and equal elemental representation, easily the best production job the band has enjoyed to this point. It is Sepultura's most essential and accomplished presentation of systematic power derived from universal entropy. Few metal albums have asserted with so much inspired conviction and consistency a path towards a dynamic style of living discovered within the suicidal jungle of personal animosity. Defiantly uncompromising in its character, Beneath the Remains is a thrilling and inspiring work that, despite the surface effects of its prophetic doom, lusts for life in its hopeless rage for change, a powerfully enduring and fierce confirmation of its own determination for personal freedom and independence.

0439023513|5.0|I don't understand the bad reviews here unless people were hoping for that perfect ending.  And to be honest, that was a perfect ending.  It was happy, it was sad and it was every emotion in between.  War is terrible and nothing turns out perfect. This story ended very human and gave no false illusions to how war TRULY affects the players involved.  It changes people, it changes everything.  This book was truly wonderful.  It took me on a ride and in the end I didn't know if I should be happy, sad, angry or mad.  You know a good book when your still thinking about it hours and even days after you have finished.      Kudo's to Suzanne Collins.  This was the best series I have read in a very long time.  The twists and turns, change in events and the way she brought shock to every chapter.  I could never put the book down.  Each time I tried she threw in a twist at the end of each chapter and made it where it was impossible to stop.
1400052181|4.0|I typically tend to gravitate toward fiction, but this book far exceeded my expectations. Both the human and the scientific elements are equally compelling, and the author's personal relationship with the family is artfully woven throughout the book. In a story about a family forgotten and a woman's contribution that has gone unrecognized, the author not only educates her reader but also pays tribute to the Lacks family.

B003INBNXO|4.0|Although I was ultimately disappointed to find out that much of what is displayed in this allegedly 'based on a true story' tale is not, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and emotions portrayed by the cast.     What I enjoyed most as I reflect on the film is that our hero is the best fighter out there and, unlike Rocky or Clint Eastwood or so many other superhero movies, we are not made to suffer through implausible scenes of our guy getting his butt kicked before he gets his. Donnie Yen as IP MAN is always the man and his being so takes nothing away from the drama or entertainment value of the film. This movie, I purchased just on the recommendations expressed here and I was very pleased. I would agree that it is one of the best martial arts movies that I have ever seen.    Those who see the sequel Ip Man 2 will see the filmmakers regretfully return to the tried and true format.

B0051QIGP4|2.0|I decided to download this album when it was on sale for $0.99.  I really don't purchase this kind of music too much because I am mainly into rock music.  However, I listen to the radio a lot and liked a few of her past singles (Just Dance, Bad Romance, Love Game).  I liked the song \\"Judas\\" when I first heard it and bought the single.  I decided to give the album a chance because hey it was only $0.99 so why not.  But if it weren't for that sale I wouldn't have purchased this.  I'm just a casual fan of some of her songs.  \\"Judas\\" and \\"Born This Way\\" are good tracks.  I also think \\"Edge of Glory\\" is one of her best and strongest songs.  However, I can't get into this album.  I listened to it a few times and there are no other tracks besides the three singles, \\"Marry The Night\\", and \\"Schiebe\\" that are really that good.  \\"Schiebe\\" being my favorite with the thumping beats, cool vocals, and catchy chorus.  For casual listeners to Gaga like myself I suggest you go with those 5 tracks.  Other than that you are going to get an album where a lot of the songs run into one another and don't really stand out.  It is much techno-y than her previous hits I can tell.  Anyways, just wanted to write my honest opinion.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Okay so, I was a skeptic. Really, I think I spent more than two months while I was pregnant doing research on mobile designs and asking friends. Given this was my 3rd child I wanted to make sure I did things right this time. You know, sticking to nursing, having more patience and actually writing in that baby book! Well, so far no luck with the baby books but this mobile is so sweet. As soon as I could find the batteries and attach it to the crib I put my 2month old son under it and the faces he was making were priceless. The leaves move up and down while the critters rotate. Adorable. Plus the music is soothing. I'd hang it over my bed too. The remote is a plus cause if he catches me going in to restart it he get to excited. Smart move Fisher Price.

B004H8GLXQ|4.0|From the back cover - Reclusive author Vida Winter, famous for her collection of twelve enchanting stories, has spent the past six decades penning a series of alternate lives for herself.  Now old and ailing, she is ready to reveal the truth about her extraordinary existence and the violent and tragic past she has kept secret for so long.  Calling on Margaret Lea, a young biographer troubled by her own painful history, Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good.  Margaret is mesmerized by the author's tale of gothic strangeness - featuring the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.  Together, Margaret and Vida confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.     My daughter-in-law loaned me this book and highly recommend it.  I have been reading it for probably 6 months!!! Strangely, I'll read a chapter, put it down and eventually go back to it.  But I have not had to go back and reread any parts to remind myself of what I already read.  It's that compelling & absorbing.  This is a novel, I guess it would be classified as literature/mystery - not the usual romance/mystery/women's fiction that we read and enjoy so much.       This is a very dark story - I guess gothic is the term.  The setting is the English countryside as the author is English.  it's a painful story involving murder, madness, ghosts, incest, the psychic connection between identical twins, you name it and it's there.  But in spite of that it is extremely well written and keeps drawing you back to finish the tale - even if it takes six months as I did.  Personally, I never read a romance until I was in my mid-fifties.  All my life had been reading biographies, the classics, general fiction etc.  then one day I decided I had read all the literature, politics, and moral dilemmas I could stand.  Now I read for pure pleasure and if a book depresses me out it goes.  This book was the exception.  It made me shiver but there was always the final ending that I just couldn't figure out so I kept after it.  Any romance in it is a twisted love between brother and sister.  And Ms. Setterfield hid the surprise from me until the very end.  Maybe if I hadn't taken so long to read it I would have figured it out sooner but I don't think so.  It is a very skillfully written book that I think will be considered a classic and a must read.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|And that's really saying something because I read a lot! This book has so much going for it. There's murder, mystery, dysfunctional family issues, medical misconduct, not to mention representations of several cultures, class struggles, and, of course, the bond of sisterhood and the pain of loss, grief. There is certainly something for everyone in this novel unless they're looking for humor. There's very little humor in this book. This is a very somber book, though there are some strokes of lightness and tenderness in it that keep it from being totally oppressive in tone.<br /><br />That the whole book is one very long letter is an unusual literary technique, and for this book, a good one. The book is highly compelling reading and at some points totally riveting. The writing is excellent and the mix of British English and American English is spot on and almost funny, though, as I mentioned earlier, there is little true humor in the book. One thing is for sure when you finish this book you know Bea far too well and Tess too. The landlord is lovable and the villians range from mild to truly evil, very richly drawn. I can honestly say that I did not want to put the book down.<br /><br />However, what kept this book from being a 5-star read for me is the ending. I can't decide if I feel cheated or if the author has done something completely unique and stellar. That I didn't see it coming is the greatest understatement ever. Foreshadowing told me something was coming, but what that something was caught me off guard completely. Usually, I would love this, but somehow that feeling that the ending was somewhat of a cheat on the author's part kept me from standing up and applauding.<br /><br />All that said, I liked the ending and am still scratching my head over whether it's brilliant or underhanded blindsiding by the writer. I will give it this: it was unique. Okay, I'll have to upgrade to 5-star because I love a good head-scratcher debate, so many books these days lack imagination when it comes to this sort of thing, but be warned, you personally may hate the ending and feel very conflicted yourself over it. The writing and story deserve 5 stars, though, so I've talked myself into the upgrade.<br /><br />I am very glad that I read this book. I know it is one that will stay with me and have me debating with myself for quite some time. I think everybody interested in it should read it and decide for themselves--then send me a quick note to help me decide lol--on their feelings about the ending of this novel. I believe it would make a terrific book club reading selection because it is sure to stir up a lively debate. Overall, great, compelling book.to this sort of thing, but be warned, you personally may hate the ending and feel very conflicted yourself over it.

0670022411|5.0|This is one of the best novels of it's genre that I have read. Not only is it entertaining, it's packed full of history. A very impressive first novel and thank-you, Deborah Harness, for writing it.
B003UESJHE|5.0|This really was the best movie of the year and worth all the hype it received.  Don't miss it!
0061998494|4.0|This is not only a funny book to read but it's very informative too. It shows how we can go from day to day not given a flip about others and selfishly do what we want not realizing that it we only apply ourselves how much further we could go in life.
0307266303|5.0|As a reader I found the story fascinating and a 'hard to put down' kind of story. As a runner I found it inspiring and it confirmed alot of what I suspected. I run with a group of 40-50 yr olds before dawn breaks 3 X a week and most days theres whooping and hollering and the sheer joy of movement as we set out down the road. This kind of joy we all had as kids and most of us have forgotten it. So my suggestion is to put or your shoes (or not) and head out the door. Afterwards read this book for added inspiration!
B004OBQDHK|5.0|I remember watching this on T.V years ago and loved it. Plus, if your into Patrick Swayze, and Keanu Reeves films. They show both film stars throughout the entire film. Keanu Reeves character plays a under cover cop who gets involved with the people who rob banks and learns how to serf to fit in. As part as his job. Patrick Swayze character is a leading bank robber of a small group of surfers.     Without adding detail and spoilers, I like to say this is a really great film. If you haven't seen it. It's a must see.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first about what studio creation would result from the husband and wife team. Mostly, I was afraid that the magic of the Derek Trucks Band would be lost. How much of the music would feature Derek? I must say, the greatest treat for a music fan is all of the great stuff on an album that take you by surprise. Especially coming to discover that the Tedeschi Trucks band is bringing out the best in the best guitar player in the world (Mr. Trucks of course).     Songwriting: This song is very lyrical. Lots of emotional content. Trucks' solos feed off of this -- i.e. Midnight in Harlem solo is a slow blues masterpiece. The songs on this album are way deeper than Already Free. Simple Things is an up tempo ballad that makes me think of loved ones right away (even though I'm not really sure what exactly the song is about, which I like). Many of these songs have an abstract element to them I've never heard from a Trucks project.     Musicianship: Top notch. Derek is getting better with every album he puts out -- by far, his solos in some of these songs have the tightest melody lines I have ever heard from him. Love the horn section. Makes for some great funk. Would like to hear a few more Kofi keys' solos.     Vocals: I had never listened to Susan much, but she is very talented. I love Mike Mattison's voice as well and would love to hear one song featuring him with some higher harmonies from Susan (at least give Mike a solo in Bound for Glory). This is their first album -- I suspect they will mix it up more in the future. Still, I like Susan as the vocal leader because her tones seem to add a perfect layer.     In conclusion, this album is my album of the year so far. I like it better than Warren Haynes new project (although I love that album too). It still amazes me how many people have yet to discover a talent like Derek Trucks. But I kinda like that when I go see he and his bands live, I can be up close without too much hassle. And tomorrow night, I am seeing them live. Can't wait to see this outfit for this first time. I am pumped!
0345528581|4.0|Great book, really helped me improve my fitness and health. Recomended to anyone who wants to be able to train at home with bodyweight even harder than at the gym. First chapters explain a lot about dieting and best exercising programs to weight loss. Plenty of pictures and variations to 150+ different exercises.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is one sturdy hunk of metal.  The knife arrived with a better edge than expected and is well balanced as a chopping tool.  The scabbard it came with is fair and will do the job for most until something better hits the market or a custom rig is purchased.  The handle scales are the only real weak point.  While comfortable, there is no grip surface to ensure positive control of the tool while wet.  Becker does offer micarta scales after market and adding a set of those to the knife helped remedy the wet grip concern.  All together this is an excellent all purpose outdoor knife.

B003YUC9JI|1.0|I was not feeling this film at all with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, this film made the original \\"Karate Kid\\" look oscar worthy.I do love the original \\"Karate Kid\\" but this remake with Jaden is another example. why you do not mess around with a classic, the story line is poor..but action scenes decent but can't carry the film, Jackie Chan is no Pat Morita for sure, sure Jackie is great at martial arts but a poor actor, i feel nothing for him..unlike Pat Morita who does a good job in acting.This new \\"Karate Kid\\" I did not like or will never buy a DVD/BluRay of this, luckily it was a $1 rental, even than that's more than I will ever spend on this new version,thumbs down!
B004GYY714|5.0|I was surprised at how many radio stations this app found.  I haven't listened to regular radio in a long time and this helped find stations that I didn't know were there.
B0000252YK|3.0|Ozzy Osbourne surely has released some other better albums, but this one still remains among my collection (personally having both the original vinyl LP and the 1995 Remaster CD).    What I love about this album is the direction Ozzy's music had turned when he had Jake E. Lee on board. Yes, I believe he deleted this one from his catalogue for obvious reasons, however it's these reasons that draws me into listening to it still to this day.    The tracks are legendary. From Ultimate Sin's dark yet comedic opener to the epic Killer Of Giants, this album does not in any way make the listener turn it off or skip too many tracks. And honestly I find myself liking most of the other tracks more than the one Ozzy retained through his live set in the years to follow, that being Shot In The Dark. It is an awesome track yes, however Never and Secret Loser may come up higher than it for me. Don't get me wrong, there is a weak track or two, but they aren't that bad that you would not want to hear them.    My only gripe as I said, it's definitely different from Ozzy's other releases, definitely glam metal in sound, and without a doubt not among his more popular albums. As I said that doesn't mean it's not a good listen however. I do wish now that Ozzy has re-released Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman for the 30th anniversary of their eipc releases and such, that some day he will find time to do something for the rest of his catalogue (including this, No Rest For The Wicked, No More Tears, Ozzmosis, Bark At The Moon and Down To Earth).    It really is ashame as well that this was prior to my generation (being born in 1989). Too many kids today do NOT know what real music is, especially those in favor of Jonas Brothers or Justin Beiber!    This album definitely deserves a 4-star rating, however I give it 3 because it really won't sit right with many, but to me it's a classic I will carry with me to my grave, among the rest of Ozzy's catalogue!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I didn't get this to read the Bible, but to be able to look things up.  It more than serves that purpose and the search is excellent.
B003ASLJS6|2.0|I first saw this film when it was initially released in the theaters, and I remember how disappointed I was at the time.  Thinking that perhaps I'd missed something, I chucked my expectations at the door and gave it another try, only to find I liked it even less the second time around.    Eastwood, as a mysterious stranger wearing a preacher's collar, arrives in a small mining community and decides to help out a group of pan miners resisting being run off their claims by the goons of a hydralic mining outfit.  Mixing and matching elements of both [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]] and [[ASIN:0783225725 High Plains Drifter]], the 'Preacher' trades in his collar for Colts and, when hired guns masquerading as the law comes to town, he not only gives the panners a chance to survive, but at the same time gets a chance to mete out divine justice.    The actors involved with the film - Eastwood, Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgrass, Chris Penn, etc - are competent in their roles; the film's problem is its script and dialog, and some sloppy choreography.    Taken literally, Eastwood's character can be assumed to have been a gunfighter at one time who was seriously wounded, and who thereafter gave up his guns for a bible.  And though it is never confirmed, it would seem that the same band of killers who are called in to run off the panners were responsible for nearly killing Eastwood's 'Preacher'.  Yet the film keeps hinting at a supernatural element - hinting at a lot of backstory that's never filled in - but instead of adding depth, it only leaves a nagging, incomplete feeling to the film.  This doesn't kill the movie - I do think it detracts from it - but coupled with a no-surprises resolution, it puts the entire effort firmly onto mediocre footing.    One scene I had enjoyed when watching this in the theater was Eastwood standing up for the miner Hull by taking on several of the hydraulic miners with a hickory ax handle, but on second viewing it looks about as convincing as an aging Steven Seagal fight scene.  I can even let that one pass - but what really sinks this movie is the utterly ridiculous interaction between Eastwood and the young girl from the mining camp who falls in love with him, as well as the scene between her mother and Eastwood when she comes to him in the middle of the night.    Eastwood fans will probably be able to overlook these and other flaws - his acting style remains fairly consistent from film to film, so if it is Clint you are looking for, it definitely is Clint you will get.  If, on the other hand, you are more interested in the film as a film rather than a vehicle for its actor, then I recommend against it, as it is lowest common denominator type filmmaking.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I love this bike seat. We purchased this for our 10 month old because we love to ride. This worked out great, its secure, easy to attach, and feels safe. Our little one gets to see everything we see instead of being behind us and not being able to see him. He can look back at mommy while he's riding and see his father and little brother when were all out on our bikes. This was a brilliant idea.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I purchased these headphones in the fall of 2010 and they worked absolutely flawlessly for about the first 6 months, then they started shutting off unexpectedly and eventually could not hold a charge so I replaced the battery, updated to the latest drivers (aug.2011) and they're still not working properly. Maybe I dropped them at some point--not sure what went wrong. I'm using these with windows vista.<br /><br />** update Nov. 2012 **<br />I purchased another pair from a large very well known electronics retailer when they were selling it at a significantly reduced price. When the kid at the checkout counter asked if I wanted to purchase the full warranty (as they always do) I actually said \\"yes\\" for a change. The final cost, including the warranty, came out to what you would pay for it online here. The warranty came in handy when I was using the headset one day and part of the plastic unexpectedly broke WHILE I was wearing it for no particular reason?! Anyway, this is clearly one of those products that has some issues... but when it is working, it works beautifully. I haven't had any problems with it in months so at the moment I'm happy with the product. We'll see what the future holds. I am also occasionally using the Sennheiser PC360s, but I love the \\"wirelessness\\" of the Logitech G930.

B004NDVJJG|5.0|Marcin Wasilewski piano, Slawomir Kurkiewicz bass, and Michal Miskiewicz drums are the Marcin Wasilewski Trio, sometimes called the Simple Acoustic Trio in the earlier days. This trio also has played closley with Tomasz Stanko as the Tomasz Stanko Quartet. All their music is very  good, some of it great. As a trio their three CDs are Trio, January, and Faithful. All three are excellent but my favorite CD by this group is the magnificent CD, January. The trio really clicked on January!    Faithful is a slower paced album than January. As such I found it slightly less engaging. The musicians are still the finest in the world but the material is just notch weaker than January. I'm a big fan of Michal Miskiewicz's drums. His technique is skillful and subtle. His cymbals never pierce but are rather understated. He has the finesse of a true master.    Marcin Wasilewski's flowing piano is smooth, sweet but precise. Wasilewski wrote some the original material on Faithful. He is quite an excellent composer. Again, I thought his material on January was just a bit better.    The recording of the material is at the usual extremely high quality that one has come to expect from ECM.    I highly recommend Faithful. But please, give January a listen.

B004I2K4DY|1.0|Les Miserables is one of the, if not, the greatest musicals of all time. However this ensemble of a cast was disappointing. Marketing was at play to gain a new audience. They did the same with Phantom of the Opera movie. Why in the world would they cast Nick Jonas? How do you go from Michael Balll to a Jonas Brother? His accent was more \\"English\\" than the British. I think little Gavourche would have put on a better Marius. This Valjean is no Colm Wilkinson. Wilksonson was the most convincing of Valjeans because you could feel a man and his struggles when he sings. This Javert commands no authority and Thenardier was difficult to watch. This cast is a dismal comparison to the Original London Cast, but this was also expected.     I do recommend that Les Mis fans rent this copy because of the nice little treats at the end of the DVD.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|She has a unique way of phrasing that gives her songs a great style and keeps them interesting.  There are some songs that I could pass on, but overall it's a solid album and worth the purchase.

B004VUP8WK|3.0|I agree that some of the songs on here are quite a stretch for Morbid Angel to attempt.  But overall there is some good material on here. \\"St. Anger\\" was way worse!  That was unlistenable.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Let me say I own this (old version) and the Pierce Brosnan (new) version. This one has just a much cooler feeling to it (thanks to McQueen). The plan and the plot is simple, the ending I thought fit the film.<br /><br />This film does not have as much action as the Brosnan version, but it is just filler if you ask me. Ditto on Russo's sex scenes, filler if you ask me.

0345529057|1.0|GRRM can write. However I bought a boxed set expecting something that was complete. The last book was written in 2005 and final volume did not come out until 2010. I did not find it in paperback yet. I feel like George got paid by the word. He must rival Barbara Cartland for formula writing. I think it could be diagrammed. However he showed originality consistently, but even that gets tiring. About 1/8 of each book is an Appendix. This was too commercialized for my tastes. He had good characterization and great underlying plots, but it just goes on and on and on and on. There are too many dream sequences which can nearly always be skipped. There is a lot of dead wood in there. I think only Janny Wurtz rivals him in this overabundance. I gave up on her and if there is a final book and resolution after her 9 or 10 books now I won't buy it. I love series. I have respect and love for Robin Hobb's 9 books of the Assassin series, the last 3 of that next series totaling to 12 are weaker than the 9. I like Bujold's Vorsigian series, and Feintuch with Midshipman series, and even O S Card. Their works have resolution and don't make me feel used, they have more depth.GRRM has potential to be great, but I'm still waiting.

0679805273|5.0|This book tells children that they can expect wonderful things out of life what ever \\"path\\" they choose.  It does not give the false idea though that everything will be rosy.  There will be times where things go wrong, but that's just the way life is and it's ok.  It is in typical Dr. Seuss style and a very enjoyable book telling children the truth at an early age.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Like a lot of Android users, my phone has a limited storage for data.  The game itself takes up almost no space - They were smart enough to move the bulk of it to the SD card.  That was fine... until I beat the adventure mode.    All of a sudden I had 15MB of space taken up from the data.  They couldn't store a file on the SD card?    Now I have to wait until I get a new phone to be able to play the game again, which is sad, but not everyone is going to have that option.    1 star for now until this gets resolved.  I have no idea what can be stored in the 15MB.  I beat the adventure mode.  I unlocked 2 or 3 items from the shop.  After that, what's the other 14.9MB of actual data?
B000WGWQG8|1.0|How did David McCullough allow this? I was shocked at the liberties taken with American history in the series that were completely absent in the book. Adams is shown showing up after the Boston Massacre to cradle the dying, then he's present at Lexington. NONE of this is true! There are far too many others to mention but the one that really put me over the edge is that they have Ben Franklin stating \\"After all, we have a Republic, if you can keep it,\\" to Jefferson and Adams in France, 1785 while this country was still being governed under the Articles of Confederation. Correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure that he stated this to an anonymous woman in Philadelphia, PA in September of 1787 after signing the new Constitution. If you love history skip this thing and read the book.
1607963183|5.0|Begin with the Conclusion:     The numerous 5-star reviews the book already earned are enough to convince a prospective reader.  So, my review opens with the conclusive remark:  This timeless classic answers the unasked question: How to keep life simple, purposeful, contended and happy.  And asks the unanswerable question: When the grown-ups actually grow-up? :)    The Plot:      Journey through this book is funny and philosophical.  The prince wanders through various planets.  He meets one man on each of the planets.  Through each of the characters, the author conveys a subtle message.      The Characters and their Messages:      Do not live authoritatively like a king who wants to exercise authority all the time and on all the subjects, have self-respect and dignity instead of expecting admiration from others like a conceited man does, do not get into the vicious circle of desires and miseries like a drunkard does, invest in the relationships with give and take approach unlike a business man who wants to be rich without enriching his life, know yourself before talking about others unlike a geographer who does not know about his own backyard but records what he hears from others (similar to what Socrates said: Know Thyself), be contended with what you have instead of pursuing something all the time at the speed of an express train, etc.  Assimilate such similes and take advantage of them.      Most Profound Message:      While almost all the human characters failed to live up to their reputation in conveying a meaningful message to the masses, the author chose an animal character to tell us of the most important thing in life.      A fox teaches us, through the little prince, that beauty of life is not in the numbers (that grown-ups focus on) but in the invisible things.   It took an animal (I'm glad it is not a goat :) to tell us to forge friendship and cultivate relationship.  And then, very importantly, be responsible by not forgetting the friends.  Be useful towhat we have just the way we derive some benefit from what we got.  Another subtle message it conveys at macro level is to establish connection with the planet Earth and preserve it.    The animal he chose is interesting.  It is not a loyal dog, not a perseverant camel, not a hardworking donkey, not an intelligent elephant, not a majestic tiger or a ferocious lion, not the unique giraffe but a fox that is known for cunningness.  I wondered about the author's reason for choosing fox!  I think he basically wanted to convey that if we keep our eyes and ears opened, we can learn from almost anyone.  Obviously, we do not need sacred water to dowse an inferno, even murky water will be useful.    Other Insights:     A flower tells to the prince that it will \\"endure the presence of two or three caterpillars\\" in order to be acquainted with beautiful butterflies.  The message it conveys is that to get long-term pleasure we need to persevere the short-term pain.      King tells to the prince that it is very \\"difficult to judge oneself than to judge others.\\"  The message is that examine yourself before you examine others.  It reminded of what Socrates said: \\"Life without self-examination is worthless.\\"    The author used the character of a lamplighter to symbolically lead us from darkness to light by telling us that we need to think about the welfare of society not just about ourselves.      The invisible values are the \\"roots\\" for mankind's life and growth.  Without roots, the mankind will suffer and perish, as the wind blows people-with-no-roots away.       The Review Ended... New Perspective Begin:      How many of us are naïve about cultivating friendship with neighbors, while unabashedly adding more \\"number\\" of online friends?     It's enough now. Let me go and shake hands with my neighbors. Are you?

For instance you may know all about how bad animals are treated, buy you probably don't know the solution your chicken is holding is made of a \\"blood bath\\"  of blood, feces, e-coli etc.  you have to read the book to fully understand what I am talking about, its amazingly sad.  I no longer eat chicken or pork at all.  I only eat whole foods 5 or 5+rated beef.  As for turkey, unless I can find a way to get it directly from \\"the last turkey rancher\\"  mentioned in the book I will never eat turkey agian either. I signed up for 2 vegan classes at whole foods also to start cooking vegan at least 5days a week.  Buy this book, you will love it!!
B003PPDBQ2|1.0|I got this based on an Amazon recommendation, I saw the rating was good but unfortunately at the time I didn't realise that only 45 people rated it, which probably all came from friends and family. Really,  don't bother getting this before the author goes back to writing school. It's boring, lengthy and the language is nausiating. Look at this: \\"Mum was silent as they put earth over your coffin. An explosion in space makes no sound at all.\\" I wish I had spent my time and money on something else
159420229X|5.0|This book provides the readers with detailed information about our brains, and why we think the way we do. The author wrote it in such a way that I never found myself getting bored of the content. He used real world examples mixed with scientific information. The information about the ancient techniques that I knew noting about captivated me.        There are also a few memory exercises that you can try out on yourself (worked for me). I wish I had known about this book a long time ago. I am planning to try and learn the techniques used in this book to help me remember more.
1604443499|1.0|I just returned this edition due to the remarkably poor typesetting and proofreading of this book. In the first 16 pages there are multiple misuses of hyphens and em-dashes, erroneous punctuation, and the omission of even a simple &ntilde; in the spanish word se&ntilde;or. It's really a shame that such a great text is being represented so poorly.
B002M9WW30|1.0|BUYERS BEWARE!!!<br /><br />ROCKY: THE UNDISPUTED COLLECTION on Blu-ray... Just a bad joke.<br /><br />When I buy a Blu-ray, of an old or new movie, I expect to see Blu-ray video quality... Restored, Remasterized, or maybe a well donde / good video transfer... But this is not the case.<br /><br />I know, they are an old movies, but I have older movies than this one with much better look.<br /><br />The video quality on this movies are so much grainy... Worst than an old dvd... There are not restored, there are not remasterized... Rocky, the undisputed collection is about how to make an awful work, just to sell and play with memories.<br /><br />I don`t return this item because I don`t live on USA, and return cost is higher than the product`s itself.<br /><br />If you are looking for the Rocky movies on Blu-ray... There are not exist yet. Keep your dvd edition. It looks better.<br /><br />Another fail besides Highlander and Crash on Blu-ray... The same problem.
B000NY17J6|4.0|If you like Linda Rondstadt and one album will do it it for you, this is the one.  From the early days thru the peak of her career.  If it had some songs from her more recent explorations back to her earlier roots I would give it 5 stars.  A lot of her hits were covers of other artists hits, but her strong voice makes you enjoy, not compare.  That was the reason they were hits for her in the first place.
B004R96TN2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Brian Froud's The Faeries' Oracle. When I heard he was creating a second oracle deck titled The Heart of Faerie Oracle, I had mixed emotions. I was excited. I couldn't wait to see a whole new set of cards with Froud's magical faerie touch. But I wondered, due to the name of the deck, if it would be a deck designed to work only with relationship issues. I hoped it wouldn't be that limiting, and I hoped the deck would be as enchanting as his first. I am thrilled to say that I was not disappointed on either count.<br /><br />The Heart of Faerie is about the heart of faerie, as in the center of what makes the fae tick. But it is also about relationships. Relationships between humans, between faeries, between humans and faeries. And relationships with anything you can have a relationship with in life, which encompasses just about anything and everything.<br /><br />The cards are every bit as magical and enchanting as the first deck. They have a different quality to them which is hard to describe. They feel more earthy than their cousins of the first deck.<br /><br />The set is comprised of a hardcover book and 68-card deck. The cards are the same size as The Faeries' Oracle (3\\" x 5\\"), which makes it easy to blend the decks if you want to have a Super Sized Froud Faerie Deck.<br /><br />My deck arrived with several damaged cards, due to unstable packaging. The cards are not shrink wrapped, and they came loose in the box. I returned the damaged cards to the publisher who graciously and promptly sent replacements.<br /><br />The beautiful backs of the cards (featuring winged hearts) are reversible, though the book mentions that they are not intended to be read reversed.<br /><br />The borders in this deck are awesome. I love that they vary slightly from card to card, though the colors and style of ragged markings are the same throughout the deck. They blend in well enough that you might not even notice they are different, but they are different enough so that they don't look like cookie cutter borders.<br /><br />The deck is divided into seven categories:<br /><br />*The Faerie Queens (the ruling, powerful feminine)<br />*The Queens' Consorts (the balancing male energies)<br />*The Archetypes (the ancient, everlasting energies of Faerie wisdom)<br />*Sprites (the young, joyful spirits)<br />*The Ladies (gifts of personal understanding)<br />*Tricksters (unexpected wisdom in a tricky package)<br />*The Journey (the sixteen stages in life's journey)... [Note: This presumably includes the three untitled cards, though they are not mentioned in the book, since it says \\"sixteen\\" cards, but only thirteen are accounted for.]<br /><br />After thumbing quickly through the deck for the first time, I was surprised and delighted to find that there were three cards which were unnamed, untitled, and absolutely unmentioned in the book. I know that this will be a source of anxiety to some people, but for me these three mysterious cards are a magical and enchanting inclusion. It almost makes me wish that all the cards were done this way, and that there was no accompanying book. I love pulling these cards in a reading because they are completely free to tell me what I need to know, unencumbered by a predefined \\"meaning\\".<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed when skimming through the deck was that there are cards named Tink and The Pan, which of course made me think of Tinkerbell and Peter Pan, though they are not mentioned in the book. The book does mention Peter Pan when discussing the card titled The Boy, which features a young lad with red hair wearing a pirate hat and coat, who reminds me of a cross between Peter Pan and Pippi Longstocking.<br /><br />I love so many of the cards in this deck, but my absolute favorite is the gorgeous and intriguing card titled The Question. It reminds me of the magical quality of movies like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth (both movies were Froud collaborations). There is another card, my second favorite, titled The Leaving, which features the same two characters as the ones in The Question, which I thought was really neat.<br /><br />For the tarot lovers, there's a shout out to tarot in this deck with The Magician, who stands amongst a flurry of wind-blown Marseilles tarot cards swirling thorough the air.<br /><br />These faeries are every bit as chatty and brilliant as the first deck. There was the time I asked if my son should open a birthday gift early, and The Gift card came up in answer. Then I pulled The Green Man on St. Patrick's Day.<br /><br />(Original review edited here for brevity. See my blog for the extended review.)<br /><br />The beautiful 137-page hardcover book is written by Wendy Froud, and includes commentary on each card. I personally preferred the book which accompanied the Faeries' Oracle (which was written by Jessica Macbeth.) The book for the Heart of Faerie is less involved in its interpretations of the cards, and almost clinical in comparison with the first book. Many of the explanations on the cards feel lacking and unfinished. I suppose this can be seen from a negative or positive point of view. On the bright side, it leaves the cards more open to personal interpretation.<br /><br />There are two very interesting spreads included in the book, The End is the Beginning (7 cards) which takes you along a journey, with an option of a shortcut (which may or may not be in your best interest). And the Three Wishes Reading (3 cards) which has you working with the faeries to make three different types of wishes.<br /><br />Also included in the book is an enjoyable interview with Brian and Wendy Froud, about the success of The Faeries' Oracle, and the inspiration behind the creation of the Heart of Faerie Oracle.<br /><br />I love this deck wholeheartedly. From the richly colored images to the black and white sketches, the serious to the silly, this deck has it all. If there was anything I could change about it, it would be the fact that there are a lot of human-esque beings in the cards, and I wish there had been a greater ratio of creature characters, as I enjoy them more. That being said, this deck is one which immediately became a favorite reading deck.<br /><br />While I have mentioned Froud's first deck, The Faeries' Oracle, several times in this review as a natural comparison, it is not necessary to own one before the other. The Heart of Faerie is not the sequel to the first deck. While they can be used together, they each stand alone perfectly well. (Though I do absolutely recommend them both.)<br /><br />If you are into faeries, or love Brian Froud's artwork, or loved the first deck and are curious about this new one, I have nothing but encouragement for you. The cards are gorgeous and engaging, and the faeries are brilliant.<br /><br />(See my blog for images of the cards and readings I've done with this deck.)<br /><br />~Kiki (TarotDame.com)thought was really neat.

B0041T7FS6|5.0|Chic was way ahead of its time, and hearing these classic jams all together confirms that Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards were brilliant song writers and musicians.  The rare 12\\" mixes are worth the price of the set alone.  A must buy!
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Having never read the book I wasn't sure what to expect but was delightfully surprised at the plot and was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.  Ayn's rather intense philosophy is readily apparent -- I'd love to see a new modern intrepretation of this classic.  The haters are almost assuredly more idealogically opposed than anything else.  Great movie, definately watch.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!  There is a nice selection of songs on this cd.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I am in my late 70's, so I remember King George.  He was much admired by his people and also by we Americans.<br /><br />The movie was phenomenal!  Performances outstanding!<br /><br />I rarely buy DVDs for myself but have purchased this one.<br /><br />The movie and Colin Firth deseerved all of the awards it received.<br /><br />I also bought this DVD for members of my family so  they could enjoy it too!
B0041TM5OU|5.0|If your looking to buy this classic on vinyl, you wont be disappointed.  You'll be blown away by the sound quality of this record. Ive bought many records that claim to be 180g vinyl but dont seem to be as thick . It's also quiet when it comes to surface noise. The record comes in a quality record inner sleeve.  I like how they went all original with this issue down to the original Columbia six eyed label!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The end of the book was good in theory, but the writing style defeated any excitement that could have been in it. The journey toward the end is very interesting and gripping with various twists and turns, but when it comes down to the moment we were all waiting for, the main character is knocked out by an explosion. At the end of a novel the heroine is not typically lying there weak and lifeless, but fighting with every ounce of strength left to make things right again. The death of her young sister at the end made me feel like the whole point of the series was defeated. Katniss entered herself into this risky lifestyle in an attempt to protect her sister... And she dies in the end.                   Though it may seem so, the content of the ending did not bother me as much as the way it was written, weakly with little excitement. Collins would have been better off ending the book with Katniss dying instead of the sister. If the sister had lived she could have represented Katniss' legacy with honor. The survival of Katniss at every turn also made the novel a bit less likable. We cannot all live forever and no one is that lucky. In this post-apocalyptic world full of hopelessness and despair the constant success of Katniss immortalized her in a way and put her above dying, as if were impossible for the main character in a book. I would have appreciated and been more emotionally attached to an ending with more of a bang surprise, not the subtlties of this one, if another book was coming, then the ending was great, but for the end of a series, a trilogy there needs to be a bang, not a slight and fading fizzle.
B004XIQIPQ|3.0|I realized the Arctic Monkeys have lost their kinetic raw energy, and like many other people I did not like their previous album Humbug, and though I appreciate the attempt nonetheless it felt like a sign of bad things to come, and now Suck it and See has come, and even though I was skeptical, nonetheless I shelled out the cash because I love this band even when it does me wrong (Humbug). The verdict? A mixed bag of songs that are really good and some really bland I love the marriage of vintage and modern rock and for the most part it works perfectly, some of the songs echo their previous work e.g. (Piledriver Waltz That's Where Your Wrong) but at the same time, some of the songs are just mediocre which is a shame, because I feel on the horizon they will find a focus that will work perfectly with their new sound, but as of now what we have is just a polarizing album that is struggling to find its identity.
1599218011|5.0|An excellent, informative, easy to understand read.  If you want to understand the inner workings of your body, you must read this book.
B003L77GGA|5.0|I am a huge superman fan. I am a huge smallville fan. I can't put into words how happy this season made me so if you liked the previous 9 you would have to be outside your mind to not watch this. watch it. do it. doooooo it. THANK YOU SMALLVILLE FOR 10 AMAZING SEASONS!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|All I have to say is: Colin WHO????  Well, I guess I have more to say than that... This is my favorite series/movie OF ALL TIME, and that's saying a lot since I am a movie fanatic.  How have I never heard of this until now??  Only found it by chance as a \\"you might also like\\" link from another DVD.  I am officially obsessed. I went back and read the book which helps flesh out the characters tremendously, too. And RICHARD ARMITAGE - OMG, where's he BEEN all this time?? Just a beautiful love story about two very different people learning to appreciate and value one another's good qualities and placing loyalty, devotion and shared ideals above concerns about money or the opinions of others. I wanted it to go on forever... That's all, just love, love, LOVE it!
030745455X|3.0|I did enjoy both books, and am looking forward to reading the third soon. The author definitely has a way of drawing you in and making you want to find out what happens.<br />However, the problem with both of the books so far is that there is too much information that you really do not need. The books would be so much more enjoyable if they were more concise! Keep it cut and dry, include what the reader needs to know and leave out what doesn't matter. I found myself skimming many pages that were full of background history on characters that were unimportant to the story line. I also understand why he would have opened the book with Lisbeth travelling, but the sheer amount of detail that was poured into what she was doing was interesting because it again played no part in the actual mystery.
B0015XHP3Q|3.0|When Sylvester Stallone started work on \\"Rambo 3\\" he was at the height of his career. He was coming off of \\"Rocky 4\\" and \\"Cobra.\\"   I believe Stallone wanted to make a Rambo film that deals with the Middle East, since the two previous films were set in either America or Vietnam.    \\"Rambo 3\\" begins with Col. Trautman searching for Rambo in Thailand. Trautman witnesses him stick fighting and follows him to where he works in a Buddhist Temple. The reason why Trautman is pursuing Rambo is because he is going into Afghanistan to help bring supplies and weapons to Afghan Rebels. Rambo decides not to go saying \\"It's got to end for me sometime.\\"  In Afghanistan, Russians capture Trautman's team. Word gets back to Rambo, and he decides to go on a rescue mission to save Trautman.    Overall, \\"Rambo 3\\" is better than the sequel, but still lacks the great story that \\"First Blood\\" had.
0345529057|5.0|It is true, that this edition is only a paper-back, but I'm very satisfied with it. Not to mention the story's quality, which won't let you put down the books for more than a minute. I'm totally hooked onto this. It arrived in 2 weeks, and the price was really low for 4 books this long. In Hungary I'd have to pay at least the double of this price.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|I don't know whats the problem with some of you.  Of course this difference in creativity might disorient some of you, its because you cannot accept experimentation. Some of you expect the same thing over and over again. As for me I have listened to this album and enjoy every bit of it.  Give it a chance!!!!!!
1401310400|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a fan of the CASTLE television series.  It is a cheeky, and sometimes cheesy bit of fluff that is pure entertainment.  The viewer is not supposed to examine the \\"facts\\" of each weekly offering too closely nor try to utilize logic.  This is just a show where you sit back and enjoy the silly banter of the cast and the sexual tension exuding from the two protagonists as they attempt to solve their latest case.<br /><br />HEAT WAVE capitalizes on the popularity of the television show and follows the same formula that made the show a success.  Unfortunately, what plays well on the small screen does not necessarily translate to the page with the same panache.<br /><br />While the book does have a couple of amusing exchanges between our two protagonists, I believe if one has never seen the show and has no point of reference, this story of the murdered real-estate tycoon and his trophy wife would have found its way to the \\"remainders\\" bin within a month of publication.<br /><br />My recommendation:  If you want to be entertained for an hour, sit back and watch the show, pass on this book and devote your time to more informative and interesting reading material.  If you feel compelled to read this offering, save your money and get it at the library.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Wonderful seller! great product! The best on the market in our book and we will buy more hen we need some. buy some and you also will be happy too!
0240815807|5.0|I must admit when I first considered ordering this book I was taken back a little by the sample audio clips posted here the before and afters. By boosting the gain even a little bit is perceived as an increase in sound quality by the way our ears work. So not only was the gain boosted but the distortion and noise to go along with it. I think some better examples would be nice. But anyhow when I received the book and I have been reading it I must say this book is dynamite.<br /><br />Everything is covered in a lot of detail. This is no mickey mouse treatise on how to record in your dorm room. For example he covers a subject as simple as speaker placement to monitor your mix and how important it is to have good quality monitors but he also covers how their position can affect your hearing the entire spectrum. He provides a link to his web site that has each of the notes that you can play through your system and they should all be the same perceived volume. If some of them are very weak and others strong you could have comb filtering which is an anomalie where reflected sound waves may arrive at your ears in a delayed fashion cancelling out the original sound like it was an out of phase signal. So how do you counter that? The temptation is to just increase the gain in that part of the spectrum. The only problem is that when you do that and then go and hear your mix on a different system that part of the song has been boosted providing you with an out of balance mix. So he provides suggestions on speaker positioning and how the room should be setup as well. For example he mentions that a bookshelf with all different size books positioned on the wall directly behind you is an ideal sound absorber eliminating reflective sound. I'm building a bedroom studio using high end gear and that would fit in with the room layout. In addition if you are into Pro Tools, or any one of the other professional mixing applications you know that you need books at the ready in order to learn the ongoing complexity of variations.<br /><br />Anyhow this is a highly recommended book if you are planning on recording anywhere from the pro studio to your bedroom. All in all a great read.<br /><br />Update: I wanted to add that this book covers the things that are lacking in most all books relating to your specific DAW. It goes beyond the tedium of how a slider works. Let me give you an analogy. In a car learning where the brake, turn signal, accelerator etc. is essential learning but it doesn't address the fine points on how to use them. You may know you have to step on the brake to make the car stop but learning just how much pressure to put on it, while keeping your heel on the mat and then letting up ever so slightly when you finally come to a stop so as not to jolt everyone in the car is all something you won't learn just by learning where all the buttons are. That is what this book covers; all the stuff you want to learn after you know were everything is. It goes beyond the small studio. It may be information that pro studio engineers already know but to the rest of us it is a breath of fresh air that will take your mixes to the next level.going complexity of variations.

0425242099|3.0|We have waited forever for these two to get together and then they get their book and they SHARE IT! What?! Really?! Hawke and Sienna don't even get an entire book? About 20% was devoted to Lara and Walker. Another 25% was war.     And then there were at least two scenes that we get a part of and they suddenly stop and we are stuck with their internal monologues several pages later which tells us what we missed!     It left me feeling cheated.     I love Nalini Singh and this was supposed to be the ultimate book. Hawke and Sienna. OMG. I have waited and waited for this book. I told people to not bother talking to me on 5/31 b/c I would be reading Kiss of Snow. So yeah, I had high expectations but I don't think wanting more scenes between the two characters is unreasonable.

B0044XV3R8|4.0|This movie is awesome. I like the Extended Edition parts of the film and feel like this is worth the extra money to get an extra 30minutes of film. The actual film in my opinion is awesome.<br /><br />However, something that I hate is the fact that it is 2 parts in the DVD. Although the point where it is divided is pretty okay, I just hate the fact that it is not one disc. I know there is so much that can fit into a DVD and the bluray disc can fit this, I hate this and wish they could have fit it all in one disc.<br /><br />My only complain is the format of the film's discs, but the overall movie was amazing and can see why this is the most grossed revenue movie in history.
1439181780|5.0|This book has helped me find peace and happiness. I was an angry person- angry with the driver in front of me, angry with the people slowing me down in line, angry and irritated more then not.<br /><br />This book has slowed me down enough to stop and smell the roses, I think simply by applying the techniques. I have found myself happier then I have ever been in my life, I have an imagination again. I appreciate everything so much more. My eyes had been closed. I had been bumbling around blind for too many years.<br /><br />As soon as I realized what this book had done for me, I went to the nearest bookstore and bought 4 copies of this book (that's all they had on the shelf), I gave the books to my family- I want them to feel as happy as I do. I will be ordering another to send to my brother who I think could really use it.<br /><br />I never read The Secret but watched the film after reading The Power. One of my first questions when looking at this book was \\"can I read The Power before The Secret?\\" Yes, you will understand The Power without first reading The Secret. It seemed to me like a more powerful book which is why I wanted to read it first.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B004H9TCH2|3.0|The vinyl sounds real nice. One problem with my copy is that it is a little warped. Won't return it as I am outside the US. Plus, it does plays perfectly. The packaging is awful. If you expect some packaging like, lets say Pearl Jam, you´ll be dissapointed. No creativity whatsoever. A lame b/w lyric sheet. Nothing else. So this vinyl edition is way way way overpriced. Its not 180 g so consider this before buying this one, or you might end up with an unplayable warped copy.    Now, the music on side one is absolutely fantastic. If side two were half as good as side one, this would be an epic album. But it will stand as a good album to me.

B004IFYMWK|1.0|I almost didn't watch all of it after the first 20 minutes. Whether it's propaganda, or just Hollywood's contribution to forgettable movies, I don't know. But, I do know that this is the most boring movie that I've ever watched. The write up and photos on the jacket are, in total, the best one-minute segments of the movie. (I did stay awake until the credits, hoping for something to happen. Nothing happened.)    Just plain BORING!

B000LZLOG8|5.0|Some people will argue about whether D & B's first few albums are better than this album & band. I guess if it depends if you're a fan of Derek & the Dominoes & Mad Dogs & Englishmen. Also, Exile on Main St. has the exact same horn section & they really made each of these projects. Carl Radle is my all time favorite bassists since his  Gary Lewis & the Playboys days. I love Home & To Bonnie From Delaney, etc., but this is the cream of the crop. Check out the complete box set of these shows for more fun.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I've seen a lot of the Jane Eyre adaptations (though not all 20+ of them) and so I wasn't sure what to expect going in to this film. I was happy to discover that this is by far my favorite of all the films, television series, etc. Mia Wasikowska's Jane Eyre is luminous - my favorite of all the Janes, and Michael Fassbender's Mr. Rochester has got to be the sexiest Rochester in the entire canon. The cinematography and music are beautiful and the use of natural light and candle light lend the appropriately gloomy gothic atmosphere.
B00139XTG4|4.0|Refreshing and a great read. Finally someone that realizes that the more we know the more we realize that we know nothing and that we are subject to randomness. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in working in the city.

0439796644|4.0|....any longtime horse lover is likely to enjoy even a little bit.  A bit of history to go with the story too, which is nice.  Knowing it is on (off?) Broadway and that Spielberg is considering a movie made it a must read too, to see how the story is executed in those media.
1592536913|5.0|I took a chance and pre-ordered this book. For the price, I expected to be at least mildly satisfied. Instead, I was stunned by the quality and content. As a long-time designer with a few awards under my belt and now a fine artist enjoying growing success in that as well, I have to say that this book would probably not disappoint even the most jaded. It contains way too much to take in at one sitting. The caliber of photography and designs of the objects themselves probably merit a much more expensive book. Even if \\"Steampunk\\" is not on your wavelength yet, just the explosion of modern ideas using Victorian sensibilities should be enough to please a creative mind.
0767817478|1.0|This is Godzilla in name only. The giant lizard is here, but his spirit is completely gone. The filmmakers are cashing in on the name.    Matthew Broderick is totally miscast. He's not exactly the first person you think of when you hear the term \\"action hero.\\"    Such a waste of film. It's amazing to me how an action/sci-fi flick can be so dull. All the explosions in the world can't make up for the lack of poor casting, bad acting, and an atrocious script.    Zzzzzzzz ... the film is so, so boring.
B0000D96NW|3.0|Machine Head launched onto the metal scene in 1994 with their hugely successful debut Burn My Eyes.  The album bowed before the altar of Pantera, and truth be told, it was more of a reflection of its time then an enduring piece of art.  That being said, this album has always been labeled Machine Head's return to form, and in many ways they are right.  If you liked Burn My Eyes, then this will likely satiate the hunger that their debut left behind.  That's right, if you had actually been waiting for nearly 10 years for Machine Head to release something like their debut then surprise, this album had been made just for you.  Reality check time now, this album suffers from the same problem the debut did.  Let's start with the positives, \\"Imperium\\" is Machine Head's new \\"Davidian\\" from their debut.  It is a detuned and groovy journey through the American and Swedish metal scenes, with it's catchy nature it succeeds as much as Machine Head ever could.  \\"Vim\\" is another catchy tune with great guitar and drum interplay.  Many of the other songs fail to stand out very far, indeed they do possess the catchy vocal patterns of Rob Flynn, yet most fail to inspire to much more then that.  I mean I will certainly concede that Rob Flynn knows how to write a catchy metal tune, he has proven that.  What he has yet to proven is that he can do it for an entire album and not make it sound overly contrived.  And this is really the issue, just like the debut, Through The Ashes Of Empire is nearly a picture perfect representation of overhyped mediocrity.  Now years later far removed from this album, one can clearly see Machine Head was on the precipice of releasing their one true worthwhile album, The Blackening.  The seeds were sewn here, with the tandem of Phil Demmel and Rob Flynn working out the kinks and getting comfortable with eachother and the direction they wanted to take the band.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have spent so much money trying to find the right earpieces for my iPod.  I found out that one of my ear holes is not as large as the other, and also if earpiece worn for too long, it starts to hurt.  I then bought headphones, but that doesn't look right, big headphones with a tiny iPod.  I read the reviews on this, and it sounded like these were for me.  Plus, they are a great price.  When I got them, I was so excited when I wore them for the first time, they fit well and the sound is great!  I bought another pair as back up.  These are perfect for me!
B004X0XA82|2.0|With Fleet Foxes previous work, they gave us a few perfect rhythmic neo-folk tunes along with a side helping of forgettable filler.  This album is just the filler.  There is not a single Mykonos, White Winter Hymnal, Blue Ridge Mountains, or the like on this album.  In fact, Helplessness Blues sounds like a bunch of rejected tracks from some failed 1960's power folk band. The lyrics, rather than poignant and relatable, have become unapproachably personal and lacking in poetic style.  The music is decent at times, but I waited the entire album for those crescendos and slick transitions for which I liked this band to start.  This material would have been better served whittled down to four-song EP, using only the actual good portions of these offerings.  Better luck next time, Fleet Foxes.

0062060554|5.0|Wow!! I loved this book! Before even opening to the first page, I admit to being a bit skeptical - so many books that receive so much pre-publication praise often don't live up to their hype, but after finishing it, I was shocked and pleased at how much the book exceeded the already high praise it has received. It was absolutely riveting! I read it in one sitting, totally absorbed in Christine's story from the very first page.<br />While the plot may not have been entirely unpredictable or completely new (Memento, some Oliver Sacks essays), the richly drawn characters and the stress of the narrator's, Christine's, situation kept me flipping one page after another. It felt more realistically accomplished than similar types of amnesia stories, and with the inclusion of the lushly written journals (always been a sucker for those in novels!) and in-the-moment action, it really felt like you were experiencing everything along with Christine. The building menace, with the balance of oh-so-logical rationalizations, kept you hoping that your darkest suspicions weren't true...<br />Impressively done, all in all. And Watson did a great job writing from a woman's P.O.V.! I will definitely be adding his name to the list of authors that I watch out for!
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I love this movie.  By far my favorite horror movie of all time.  I have seen many, I hate bad acting and fake props etc.  This had a plot I couldnt predict as well as good acting.  Halle Berry can cry on a whim.  It was able to have this without sex scenes and horrible gore (as most movies seem to have nowadays).  Few cuss words but it is about rape, so caution to the youngsters.  Ive seen it a million times! (doesnt mean i encourage rape in any way shape or form, this is a disclaimer).

0316069884|5.0|Wow, wow, wow... one of the best things I've read in a good long while! Foer is an outstanding writer, and I will now proceed to seek out everything else he's ever written... If you're *either* somewhat drawn towards a veggie diet, *or* if you're a committed omnivore who isn't yet aware of how much it matters where your food comes from: please read this book. It's a brilliant, fast read about the many reasons that factory farming of living things is a hideous idea, in terms of human health, environmental sustainability, and of course the conditions inflicted upon living things being (for want of a better term) 'farmed'. Whether or not you have any intention of ever going veg, don't pay these guys to do this stuff! Knowledge is power; and this book is a perfect introduction to all the reasons why-- no matter what type of diet you choose to follow-- 'no factory farmed animal anything!' is an excellent idea. A must-read, for anyone interested at all in the ethics of food, human health, vegetarianism, conscientious omnivorism, sustainability, animal welfare/ cruelty issues, philosophy, &/or good writing... 5 stars!
B004EPYZPS|3.0|Young friends in the late 70's witness a huge train wreck while filming a movie. What they soon realize is that something escaped from the train during the accident and the military will do anything to cover it up.<br />  Super 8 starts out exciting, becomes very slow in the middle and then is exciting again. So I never found the pacing to be too good, while the film also reminded me of way too many Spielberg movies, including E.T, War of Worlds, Close Encounters and Goonies \\"which he produced\\" among others. While the thing in it \\"and I won't give away what it is\\", isn't very original looking.<br />  I will say that the film at least works emotionally and that all of the young actors are very strong in their roles. The look of the film is also faithful to Spielberg which works since the film is basically a tribute to him. But they might as well have gave away more of the plot in the trailers since the movie really isn't too original.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I wasn't sure quite what to expect from this series when I started reading Beautiful Creatures, but I read it in one sitting as well as the sequel Beautiful Darkness. Let's just say I am anxiously awaiting the third book in this thrilling trilogy, Beautiful Chaos. What a ride these books were. Loved it. The relationship between Ethan and Lena has so many twits and turns that I was left hanging by the edge of my seat while reading this book. It is highly recommended. It's also nice to read a narrative from a boy's point of view. I came to care about Ethan and Lena and what fate had in store for them. You feel for Ethan and all he's had to go through with losing his mother and then the ups and downs of his feelings for Lena. His feelings are so sweet and you truly root for them to win and triumph over evil.

B004NSULHM|3.0|I won't go through a list of Radiohead credentials to justify my opinion, suffice it to say I'm fan enough to have enough ticket stubbs and b-sides to qualify. Though I've always loved Radiohead, I've always been aware of their ability to produce a fair amount crap with their genius (as anyone who's heard the On A Friday demos or Pablo Honey would know). If you really listen to their back catalogue, you'll find that The Bends is the only album in which every track stands by itself (unless you're one of those wierdos who actually sees the musical (underlined) value of Number 9 of the 90s knock-off Fitter Happier). A cynic would say the 'revolutionary' ways of issuing their last two albums (one free on the internet, the other in a newspaper) has been to make up for what the last decade had tought everyone to expect to be musically revolutionary. This, just like In Rainbows, is not Radiohead reinventing the wheel. Much of it just sounds like Radiohead, with a few more tricky time signatures every now and then to keep you guessing (as on Separator). Of course, sounding like Radiohead has been one of the greatest compliments to pay a musician since 1997, so it's hardly a complaint, but frankly the chaff is beginning to outweigh the inspired.     Little By Little has a sinister guitar riff, reminiscent of the earlier (and better) National Anthem and Go to Sleep. Codex is brilliant, haunting and absolutely bloody miserable Radiohead (\\"Jump off the edge/Into a clear lake/With no one around\\". You decide if it's suicide or a nice day out in nature with your significant other). It's the 'Nude' and 'Videotape' of this ablum and by far the best, if not the most commercial song. Separator starts off awkwardly thanks to its unusual time signiture, but Johnny Greenwood's laidback guitar noodling, which begins a little late for my tastes, saves it from being boring. The rest is middling to terrible Radiohead, which you'd be unsurprised to find on a Hail to the Thief B-Side, but fournote worthy songs out of what seems like a fairly lazily (though not badly) put together eight isn't bad, it's just not brilliant.     In the end none of these songs are likely to see out the next year or two in popular memory. Honestly when was the last time you sat down and listened to In Rainbows all the way through. Even if it was recently (and I doubt it), I'd wager you'd prefer to listen to an earlier Radiohead album anyway. The same can be said for this. It is 2011's distraction before we all go back to OK Computer, The Bends, Kid A and Amnesiac.
0061120073|5.0|This is a beautifully written book that invokes a world long forgotten.  I enjoyed the pace of the novel, which is much slower than many stories published later in the 20th Century.  I also enjoyed how Smith captures the critical time in a young person's life as one grows and changes.
B004HYGF18|3.0|Seems like every year someone is proclaimed in Q Magazine (my monthly purchase of note since 2000) to be the saviours/new darlings of indie rock. Sometimes they get it right (The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys), more often they get it wrong (Glassvegas a blaring example of expectations royally smashed). Last month (April, 2011) it was The Vaccines. Frankly, they're alright. This is not reinvention though. Much of it is what Arcade Fire playing Rooney (remember them?) with slightly racier lyrics would sound like. The lyrics themselves have (on the best songs) a consciousness reminiscent of Reverend and the Makers (indie saviours of late 07), but they seem to run out of ideas, trapped in what sounds like a rather middle class upbringing (as displayed in Somebody Else's Child). As a middle class guy of basically the same age I can hardly complain about this, but the confusion over relationships and illadvised sex is familiar enough to not need to be told about. I'd imagine this would appeal to the 'individual' indie teenager for whom the Arctic Monkeys are a little too jarring, Arcade Fire too monotonously pounding (i.e. boring) and for whom 'shagging their stoned family friend whilst everyone else is passed out downstairs' (I'm paraphrasing, but not much) and 'Post Break-Up Sex' are still unknown experiences. There are some catchy tunes, and some which positively scream their influcences (Wreckin' Bar could be a Ramones B-Side, whilst A Lack of Understanding has an unmistakable New Wave sound in Justin Young's voice which wouldn't be out of place in a Smiths cover band), but none of these are truely memorable. The problem is the likes of the Cure and the Smiths did this stuff twenty-five plus years ago and they did it better. It'll get some 16-18 year olds through the next summer of break ups and first concerts, but that's about it.

B004NDVJA0|4.0|Philharmonics is a delightful and charming album from someone with undeniable musical talent, but frankly one hasn't had to look far to find such albums in the last ten years. Even within the relatively small cross section of angelically voiced female singer songwriters, heavily influenced by decidedly aged music (English folk songs or pre-war jazz), with interesting names and from Nordic countries, the Icelandic Emilíana Torrini provides staunch competition. This album is full of piano work, but only at the end of many songs (such as the beautiful last few seconds of Just So) does the music truly flow and one become aware of Obel's skill. Some songs simply feel plodding with distinctly Chopin tinged flourishes added on as an after thought, which would be manageable if the lyrics were truly impressive, but they aren't. They're not bad, just not mind blowing, which is a bit of a shame for a heavily lyric driven genre. I know it's a lot to demand complex, poetic metaphors from someone who speaks English as a second language, but Emilíana Torrini manages it and English is her third. It's a fine album, and certinaly one to listen to again and again, particularly when doing something else, but few of the songs stand out, which makes the lack of variation from track to track all the more apparent.

B004G8QHKO|4.0|Reading the reviews of this album on amazon ('beyond music!' 'the sound of 2011!') you'd be forgiven for thinking that The Naked & Famous were some combination of John Lennon, Dubstep and Jesus. This is definately a brilliant, solid, highly enjoyable album and they're already proving to be the biggest (and best) thing to come out of New Zealand for years (OK, that's not hard when the main competition is The Flight of the Conchords, but still). I listened to little else for days when I bought this album it's still more than decent six months later. Their sound, though not unique, is certainly distinctive and ideal for festivals (this album has 'Glasto' written all over it). It's not musically complex, or even ridiculously catchy, but the thumping bass and combination of distorted guitars and crystal clear keyboards just make you want to move. The stand out songs include the singles Young Blood and Punching in a Dream, but also the less well known (but fantastic) Girls Like You, which is bound to feature of several upset teenager boys' mix-tapes this summer (though that's not a criticism in this case). The Sun (an all too familiar story of hangover ridden post-coital shame) also has a sinister, haunting quality to it which is just so cool. If I had a complaint about it, it would only be that the promised crechendo isn't impressive enough, but I'm nitpicking really. No Way also has a brilliant breakdown at its end which makes one lament that the rest of it isn't as good.   There are holes, people could find Alis Xayalith's voice trying (though I don't), Jilted Lovers tries (and fails) to cover its emptiness with shedloads of distortion and The Ends, with its annoyingly 80s guitar lick, is a needless interlude, but again, these are hardly massive complaints and at worst you can just click the 'next' button (you won't have to much). It's definately a contender for best album of 2011 and does deserve far more accolades than it has recieved, particularly given the competition from summer's sub-par festival bands. So this is one of the few times you can actually believe the hype.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|i remember people talking bout this album coming out. i heard some people really disliking it. but honestly i thought it was pretty  decent but alittle different. but atleast david vincent is back on vocals. i will say it probaly the most different you will see out of there career. but i really enjoyed it.
0307408833|2.0|I don't know why this cookbook claims to be \\"Mostly\\" gluten free, as it is loaded with recipes containing Spelt.  If your health concern is gluten, then you are better off spending your money on another cookbook.  Annalise Roberts' [[ASIN:1572840994 Gluten-Free Baking Classics]] is wonderful, and if you have food allergies too, such as dairy or egg, I highly recommend [[ASIN:1587613484 Allergen-Free Baker's Handbook]]  Pascal's recipes are quite similar to Roberts', but without the dairy, eggs, nuts, etc.  Checkout both of those authors' websites first; there are lots of recipes for free!

B004HEXSLI|5.0|Dr. Taylor's experience of a major brain hemorrhage and subsequent recovery is a remarkable chronicle of what goes through a person's mind as the event occurs.

0307454541|3.0|In the novel, A Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, the Swedish author creates a story centered around crime-solving with compelling characters that really suck you in. But as much as the hype led me to believe that this was going to be a mind-blowing book, I was disappointed. I as first introduced to this trilogy from watching the movies, which I found was pretty good if I avoided the cringe-worthy rape scene. I moved on to the books, expecting the same, but I felt the plot was lacking in various ways.<br /><br />The main heroine, Lisbeth Salander is a young woman with social problems, but has an extraordinary gift for hacking. I like that she defied stereotypes, even if she seems unrealistic. She's short, extremely skinny, has a rebellious streak and a sharp mouth. On the other side, the protagonist is Mikael Blomkvist, a middle-aged ladies man who works as a journalist. But after an incident, he was sued and he chose to leave his job, only to land another job from Vanger, a man looking for his missing daughter.<br /><br />One problem I didn't like about the novel are the abundance of tropes that show up often in these kind of crime-solving thriller novels. Rape and sexual abuse is prevalent throughout the novel. Although it is supposed to set up a way for Lisbeth to exact revenge on her own rapist, I found it in poor taste and honestly, it's been used many times before in comics, movies, and other novels. I do not condone rape-culture and Larsson repeated use of sexual assault towards women does not strike me as pro-feminist. More like misogynistic. Same thing with Blomkvist as well; he doesn't exactly hate women, as many of the men in the novel seem to be, but he doesn't exactly treat them as something other than a sexual object. Sure, Lisbeth makes sure that her rapist will never rape again, but it only emphasizes that the victim, the woman, must bring it into her own hands to fix the problem, thus taking the responsibility from the rapist.<br /><br />But what can I say? Sex sells. Consensual or not... The plot was sketchy at most. The beginning of the novel slogged onwards and at times, I would put the book down for another. The pacing was a bit slow in some parts, but the action scenes kept me going on. I can't help but like Lisbeth, although she has a strange obsession with her breasts, which she hates. At times, the dialogue and monologue seems to be repetitive and there is a lot of one-sided conversations between the two. In the end, the book was a bit of a disappointment, but perhaps it was my fault for watching the movie first. Definitely a good read for crime-novel-lovers. You might want to avoid it if you don't like rape being used as a trope in books, however. I certainly don't.sells. Consensual or not... The plot was sketchy at most.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fun game.  My main gripes are covered in other reviews, but here they are again:    - LONG start-up time EVERY time the app starts (including when switching between apps)  - Doesn't remember my sound settings so I have to turn off the sound every time I play  - Doesn't prevent the phone from sleeping, forcing the app to load all over again if it sleeps
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I was puzzled (and, I'll admit, annoyed) to find that so many of the lower-rated reviews of \\"THE HUNGER GAMES\\" were all concerned with the book's content rather than its quality because, in my opinion, there wasn't anything to complain about on that front. Suzanne Collins had an excellent idea here, and as a storyteller, she's got some amazing potential.<br /><br />I've had this book sitting on my shelf since it was released in 2008, long before the sudden explosion of popularity that \\"MOCKINGJAY\\" ushered in. So maybe it's all the recent hype that's paved the way for my disappointment. All I know is that by the end of this book, I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />Nothing about Collins's writing stands out to me. In fact, her voice ranks as a low C on my grade scale; there was something incredibly remote and lifeless about the description, something flat in her dialogue and the story's tone. Collins build herself a fantastic world here, yet it came across as totally uninteresting through the protagonist's eyes. And after looking forward to seeing for myself all the good things I'd heard about Katniss, her lack of depth really surprised me. There wasn't anything I particularly liked about her supporting cast, either; cool names were everywhere, but there was a startling lack of cool development.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing wrong with \\"THE HUNGER GAMES\\". Not really. It was just a boring novel, plain and simple, another brilliant concept executed poorly. I had a relatively good time reading this, but unlike my friends, my experience with this trilogy ends here.<br /><br />(Also, it would be awesome--AWESOME--if we could all stop comparing every YA dystopian/speculative fiction book to \\"THE HUNGER GAMES\\". Please. Please please please. It is absolutely killing me to see other novels bashed because, unlike the dozens of identical siblings in the paranormal genre, they've got so little in common with the \\"leader\\". Surprise, but dystopian fiction existed long before Suzanne Collins. )
B000JQUZCI|3.0|I read this story because I love reading the originals of classic stories we're used to hearing parodies of. This book is extremely different than the Frankenstein story we think about in America today. It is well worth the read if only to see those differences and marvel at how much the story has changed over the years. But if you're just looking for a good horror or fantasy/sci fi work I'd keep moving. The book itself is slow, and skips over almost all of what little action there is, choosing instead of spend time on the psychology of the monster and creator.
0316056863|1.0|I remember back about 10-15 years ago, every comedian who was ever interviewed on TV thought they should write a book.  I have wasted many an hour reading them and this is the sad continuation of that terrible time.  This book is snippy and just not funny.  I found it both completely self-conscious and also very shallow.  I can't say I found anything funny during the entire book.  This book is not worth your time or your money!
B004VUP8WK|3.0|My first review of Illud Divinum Insanus pertained more to the obvious new direction the band has taken. With more listens, the album has grown on me.<br /> In some ways the album seems like two different albums mixed together. About half the album consists of pounding death metal. The other half is peculiar, campy, and somewhat tongue in cheek. 'Radikult' does sound like a Marilyn Manson rip off from 'The Golden Age of Grotesque' with its bouncy rhythm and shout it out loud choruses. 'Destructos vs. The Earth' sounds comic book like in its taking over the world battle scenery.<br />  My favorites are 'Too Extreme!' and 'Profundis Mea Culpa'. The former has a pounding techno drum beat that is way loud in the mix and at times sounds like they forgot to edit the song to make it more concise, but this is what makes the song interesting- Are they deliberately trying to be annoying? The latter sounds the furthest from the Morbid Angel we love. 'Profundis' has a hyperactive rhythm that sounds like they bought some amphetamines off the street before they finalized the track, but I love this song!<br />  Its nice to see David Vincent back in the band. I dont know if most will appreciate their experimentation. This is not Morbid Angels 'St. Anger'. That album screamed of confusion and identity crisis. Illud Divinum Insanus sounds way more confident, if not arrogant in its presentation. Entertaining to say the least.
0061122416|2.0|How could so many others think this is a good book?  An explanation could provide another chapter for Charles Mackay's 19th Century classic [[ASIN:1461078369 Extraordinary Popular Delusions and The Madness of Crowds]], and is the primary reason I added an extra star to my review. Reading it to gain additional insight into your fellow man (or woman) is a recommending feature.<br /><br />With 1600 plus reviews posted, it is somewhat difficult to find something new to say. I do take some comfort in the 300 plus 1-star and 2-star review, some of which are excoriating. I try to judge a book by its genre: it makes no sense to critique a textbook on quantum mechanics for its lack of Faulknerian prose. Coelho's novel is a fable. The first 20 pages or so were plausible.  And there is the subtheme of cultural interactions between the Western and Islamic world. But that is as good as it gets, and it runs down a very steep slope thereafter. Others have denounced it for its \\"New Age pabulum\\"; comparisons with [[ASIN:0743278909 Jonathan Livingston Seagull]] abound.  Also, numerous reviewers have said this is no [[ASIN:0590129279 The Little Prince]]. And I agree. I have moved beyond the stage of having young children, but my advice to any such parent is to keep this book out of their hands; it seems to espouse all the wrong lessons for life.<br /><br />Like what? Well, there is nothing wrong with the innocuous and a bit inane: \\"follow your dreams,\\" but in this case that dream is the proverbial pot of gold at the end of, well, not the rainbow, but the trail, at the pyramids. Along the road you are assured of having \\"beginner's luck.\\" Others have said that the wisdom in this book is ankle deep, but surely the clich&eacute;s are up to your knees. There is: \\"the darkest hour is just before the dawn,\\" followed by God watching out for drunks and small children. One review speculates that surely Coelho is piling all this on to see when... finally... someone will catch on.<br /><br />The protagonist, the young shepherd, Santiago, meets a young girl from a completely different culture, and decides she will be his life-partner after about 10 minutes. Hum! Naturally she must wait patiently, drawing the water, and no doubt hewing the wood, for him to return from his heroic journey. A great message to place in your daughter's hands! \\"...because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man.\\" There is also that pseudo-wisdom from the East, encompassed in one word: \\"Maktub\\"; \\"it is written.\\" Predestination and fatalism. So, kids, it doesn't really matter what you do in school. And speaking of which, in an age where the advocates of \\"creationism\\" struggle to place its teaching on an equal footing with evolution in our schools, and a useful critique of that approach is: What next? Teach Alchemy on an equal footing with Chemistry, and Astrology on an equal footing with Astronomy?  Sadly, isn't that what this book also promotes: the mumbo-jumbo wisdom of the Alchemist...  \\"Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane.\\"  But don't get me started...<br /><br />What does not appear to have been covered in other reviews is that Coelho's desert depictions appear to be those of someone who has never been to one. The flooding of the Nile ruined the farmer's land, per the author, when in reality it was the flooding that maintained its fertility. Oasis were not sanctuaries during tribal warfare, but intensely fought over. The permanent residents of an oasis lived in mud houses, not tents. And for sure, when you are about to cross the Libyan desert, you don't abandon your camel, which might make it, for a horse, which will not. But don't get me started, redux...<br /><br />As of this posting, the book is selling in the top 100 at Amazon. Like reading the works of Glenn Beck, it is important to read what is popular, even if it is outside your normal \\"comfort-zone.\\" 2-stars.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Unless you have been living under a rock, you know what the movie is about. If you have been living under a rock, here's the short story - king dies, king abdicates, king learns something to enrich his and his country's lives. I was drawn to this movie for a few reasons, one is that I am interested in WWII and also my father was a stutterer.<br />Colin Firth plays  Prince Albert, commonly referred to as \\"Bertie\\". He has a stutter that prevents him from being able to give public speeches. He tries to avoid it as much as he can and tries to stay out of the spotlight. After all, he is the younger son, his brother, Prince David (Guy Pearce) will become king upon the death of their father, King George V.<br />Bertie's wife, Princess Elizabeth,d played by Helen Bonham Carter, has searched for speech therapists to help her husband. The traditional methods (marbles in the mouth for example) do not help. Each failure makes Bertie more miserable and also more prone to failure.<br />Now, we know that Prince David does ascend to the throne. We also know he abdicates so he can marry his twice divorced love Wallis Simpson. This is a real crisis for Bertie as he never intended and in fact, was never groomed to become king as his brother had been groomed.<br />But Princess Elizabeth manages to find a very intriguing speech therapist from Australia, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Lionel insists on Bertie coming to Lionel's office and does not show any special consideration because Bertie is a prince. He also expects Bertie to quit smoking, take some exercise and work on the process of learning how not to stutter.<br />Normally Bertie would have been given a pass as he would not have expected to become king. Lionel works on some of the psychological problems that contributed to the stutter - an abusive nanny seems to get the bulk of the blame for Bertie.<br />And finally, of course, according to history and real life, the big test comes. Bertie doesn't have to stand up in front of a classroom and make a speech for 10 minutes to about 30 minutes. He has to make his speech in front of a radio microphone in front of all of England. And he also has to deal with the beginning of WWI.<br />As history shows, King George VI (he took the name from his father) accomplished his goal. He managed to guide England through one of their darkest hours in history. It's very difficult to imagine that his brother or anyone else could have done this journey as well as he had managed to do.<br />All the actors are brilliant, Geoffrey Rush being a special delight. The continuity and the pacing of the movie is great. I would definitely recommend this movie.<br />So if you'd like to see a movie that is uplifting but not in the puppy dog way, if you willing to dip back in time, I highly recommend this movie. If the whole thought of royals and their problems leave you cold, don't bother with this movie.eech for 10 minutes to about 30 minutes.

B002QKZLZ6|2.0|The corner of the case broke while I was sitting. The case is kinda soft. I'm not sure but the front part of the case may be protected by cardboard or soft plastic. Well, a month after my case broke my Voyager Pro's earpiece broke while it was in the case.<br /><br />I clip it to my right side. I think my seat belt broke it or I might have broke it with my stomach while sitting or leaning to the right. But that's still not acceptable. My waist size is 34 so I hardly have a belly hanging over my pants.<br /><br />The Plantronics costumer service was very positive experience though. They sent me a new set within three days of making a report. I don't want another of these cases. I will look for something better.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have read vampire books over the years and found most of them laughable. In &#34;A Discovery of Witches&#34; I got caught up in the story and the relationship between the protagonists and forgot that I was reading a vampire book. The dialogue was natural and the love between Matthew and Diana undeniable. Never once did I stop cheering for the good guys. My only regret is that I bought it before the second book was finished. Like a great vacation, I didn't want it to end and now I'm wildly impatient for the next installment. If you love an intelligent plot with great characters and other-wordly intrigue, you will love &#34;A Discovery of Witches.&#34;
B003UESJH4|5.0|I loved the movie in the theatre, and love it even more with the special extras on a dvd.  Great acting, wonderful spoken English, and a great portrait of Edward and Wallace - gives one a good idea of why he was not fit to be king.  The whole thing was a delight.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is totally doable from day 1. I wouldn't reccomend to someone who is used to a HARD workout though. If you've been out of the circuit for a while, this is a good way to kick start a routine, but you'll tire of it quickly.
1439102724|1.0|I have loved every single novel Jodi Picoult has penned, and this is the first exception.    The thing Picoult does really well is that she presents both sides of controversial political and societal issues so that you can never really guess which way she leans, and leaves it up to the reader to make up their own mind. She is there to make the readers think, without any hidden agenda of her own. Hence there is never that predictable, two-dimensional \\"the good versus the baddies\\" characterisation going on as you see in children's cartoons and badly written adult fiction. Every major character is complex (as are all people) in Picoult's other novels and we see both their weaknesses and the inherent good in them.     Not so with this one.    My own political and religious beliefs aside, I found myself cringing at Picoult's characterisation of the Christian characters. Every single one of them was the worst stereotype of Christians imaginable. In SYH, Christian wives are meekly deferential to to their husbands. Libby is so sickeningly sweet and apparently has no opinions other than what is straight out of the Bible (she makes BIRTHDAY cakes for Jesus, for goodness sake). Wade Preston is an arrogant, narrow minded lawyer who annoyingly insists on calling embryos \\"pre-born children\\" (I have never heard this phrase used, even by most die hard pro-life advocates). He uses dubious trickery and manipulation to try to force a win in his case - he is the stereotypical Bible thumper who has no empathy for anyone who does not agree with his own zealous beliefs. Clyde the pastor doesn't even believe in treatment for psychological disorders. Max is a born-again Christian who hypocritically lusts after his brother's wife. Amongst the millions of Christians around the world there is a diversity of beliefs regarding gay marriages, children raised by gay parents, and IVF. Picoult basically presents a small fraction of such diverse beliefs, and chose to make her characters as hypocritical, dislikeable, annoying, and intolerant as possible.     I remain a fan of Picoult, but I doubt SYH would have received as much readership if it were written by a first-time novelist. It is too unrealistic in characterisation and predictable in plot to make it a good read. This one is a prime example of how a bad novel gets high sales volume because of the author, not for the content.

1594744769|4.0|by Laura Forsythe<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a box of chocolates. That's barely even a metaphor: the design of this book would be perfectly at home on a pack of truffles. The classy red outside with gold lettering (underneath the dust jacket -- which is not too shabby itself), the gorgeous monochromatic brown/black endpages and chapter transitions like those crinkly, shiny papers between the layers of sweet goodness. And bonus! -- each layer in this box (or chapter in this book) comes with several of the most wondrous photographs you ever did see, like vaudevillian trading cards of juvenile oddities. Before you even begin to taste the story, I guarantee you will be won over by this thing of beauty.<br /><br />I know. You don't judge books by their covers and/or interior design elements. Well, as you're probably getting a sense of, you are a better person than I am. I think it's important to admit right up front that I absolutely chose this book based on appearances. Which is not to say that the rest of this review is going to be about how disappointed I was in the actual text. But it is to say that if I had been paying more attention to Amazon's notes on themes and content, I would probably not be writing this review right now.<br /><br />Because I don't trust books about time travel. At least, not the kind of books about time travel that I feared this book was going to be when the timey-wimey stuff first started happening. Specifically, books where Protagonist X needs to learn a Lesson about The Past, so they shall be sent back in time for no apparent reason other than its narrative resonance in their life! At the outset, this book has all the trappings of being that kind of story: a somewhat clueless, exceedingly privileged young protagonist (16-year-old Jacob Portman, reluctant heir to a pharmaceutical fortune); cross-generational family drama intersecting with a defining moment in history (unanswered questions about Jacob's recently-deceased grandfather, a holocaust survivor); and a wise mentor-type character who nudges said protagonist to investigate said moment (the shrink Jacob's parents send him to when he insists that Grandpa Portman was killed by honest-to-god freaky fairy tale monsters). All of these elements are presented freshly, with grace and style, and absolutely had me hooked in spite of where I saw things heading -- but still, round about the actual \\"oopsy daisy looks like I'm in 1940 now\\" moment, I was acutely aware that if I hadn't committed to reviewing this book, I probably would have put it down and gone no further. Call it a blind spot in my suspension of disbelief; that stuff just does not process well for me.<br /><br />But blessedly, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children turns out to be the other kind of time travel book. The kind where time travel is not just a way for some slacker to research the past without cracking a book, but rather essential to the substance of the events being described. Jacob isn't just there to observe history for a little while before returning to the present, grateful and unscathed. He is there to participate in the future--albeit a future that takes place many years before his birth. And yes, there are Lessons. But not the trite ones I feared. This book is about the moments when your parents and their parents turn out to be real people, flawed and capable of doing things that make themselves and their loved ones miserable. It is also about how you turn out to be a real person, capable of understanding what makes those sad decisions seem necessary--but also capable of taking chances on your own equally perilous decisions. It is about how you choose the Right Thing out of several Not-Quite-Right possibilities, and how to be a decent person without wasting time on remorse. And it's about hanging out with secretly ancient kids with superpowers and amusing dialects in a land where the sun shines every day.<br /><br />So yeah. I'm glad I stuck this one out to the end, and I daresay you might like to do the same.ay you might like to do the same.
0307463745|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read, the way it is written is simple and easy to understand, I personally saw my own errors in my company reading this pages.    Nice work! I recommend this book to every entrepreneur or starter! ;)

B004Y03LQ2|4.0|Maiden have done a lot of things well with this release.    1. It contains a great selection of songs from thelr last 20 years (8 studio albums).    2. The song selection is fitting for their current Final Frontier tour.    3. They positioned this collection well for new fans, pricing a double CD as a single.    The one thing I can't stand about this, or any other Maiden compilation however; is that they always deprive us of a few studio versions of songs.  I can't stand how they have live version sprinkled in here.  There have been probably 4 or 5 compilations that all have Fear of the Dark on them, and every single one is a live version of the song.  Please, if you're going to release live music, make it a live album.  If other people are like me, they want to listen to either studio music, or live music; but rarely both at the same time.  Just my two cents, but I can't imagine I'm alone in this.    Either way, if you're new to Maiden and/or going to see them on this tour; this is a GREAT way to get ready for it!

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith's portrayal of Chris Gardener in \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is Chapter three of the unabashed book version of the trauma, pain and suffering of a young man's impoverished journey from his early childhood through his struggles in his commitment to be a single father. This is a true story of Chris Gardner, who in the 1980s experienced being homeless, while caring for his young son. Gardner seized the moment and created an opportunity, while Homeless, to make it as stockbroker after being selected into an internship program. The film depicted the last chapter in the book and stays true to Gardner's struggle and story. Chris Gardener was on set during the production and appears in the last scene. Chris Gardner is the successful man that passes Smith walking with his son. Smith glances back at the real Chris Gardener, the successful man that he would grow to be. If you haven't read the book, it is a must read. It would certainly make an excellent gift for any young man struggling with difficulties, self-esteem or doubts about creating the Best that one can Be - starting with nothing. Chris Gardner experienced the American Dream and helped many along the road to his success. Today, a self-made millionaire, he realized his dream to meet the former South African President, Nelson Mandela who welcomed Gardener into his home. Gardener says in the end of his book: \\"I am Blessed Among Men.\\" Be warned. It has X-rated language that certainly could not be in the film. ~ The Prosperity Doctor
6302470021|3.0|As long as you do not take this movie seriously,it is quite fun to watch.I think it is a fun date movie.My problem with this edition is that there were extras on the previous edition that are not included on this edition.Perhaps they will rerelease it on BLUE RAY and include ALL the EXTRAS.
1597771120|5.0|Roth's American Pastoral is perhaps my favorite of his many novels.  Through Swede Lvov we traverse the post-war American experience of first generation American-Jews in Newark as they strove for the American dream up through the urban riots and their aftermath that destroyed both cities and families.      The late, Ron Silver, was a fine American actor, who graced silver screen in Bashevis Singer's \\"Enemies: A Love Story\\"; the Broadway Stage in \\"Speed The Plow\\"; and in the acclaimed television series \\"Chicago Hope\\" and \\"The West Wing\\".  His narrations of \\"American Pastoral\\"; \\"Plot Against America\\"; \\"I Married A Communist\\" are little gems well worth adding to any audio library.  In my estimation, after listening to many an audio recording, Ron Silver, Jeremy Irons and Campbell Scott are simply the 3 best.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My sons have both loved this toy.  I bought it for my first son when he was 9 months old.  Shortly after that, he learned how to walk, so we didn't need it much anymore.  It then was used by two of my sister's kids, and now is currently being used by my 16 month old.  It is still in GREAT shape!  They all LOVE it, and are soon running with it more than they walk with it.  I would very much reccommend this toy.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|this movie is rocks. i love a good thriller and too many of today's horror films are based off of sex, blood and gore. shutter island is the complete opposite of that. it keeps your mind going and amplifies the shock factor to give you a good scare instead of simply adding an unnecessary amount of blood and guts. if you like a good late night thrill and horror films that actually shock you and don't just gross you out, i highly recommend seeing this!
B00280LYIC|5.0|a friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday. i hadn`t wanted to read it, but i did it anyway, just make her happy. and by athena, i adored it! i have always loved greek mythlogy, and i`ve read practically all i can get my hands on! i liked this book because i enjoyed the adventure, as well as the humor that comes along with it! perseus, son of poseidon, is my hero, from slaying the evil medusa to spraying the camp bullies, the book makes me smile. i can`t wait for the next one!  if you are looking for other good books for kids on greek mythology, try the pandora series or the goddessgirl books.

I may be incorrect about them needing to be synced to Double Twist on a computer tho.

B00005JMJG|5.0|'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' is an intelligent, smartly written dark comedy exploring the inner recesses of the mind and the essential role our memories play in defining who we are. It's one of those films that you don't want to miss a word of dialogue, or a single frame of the visuals. Every comment, every gesture and every background setting is imbued with meaning and emotional context. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet are at their very best as the two mismatched lovers Joel and Clementine and the rest of the supporting cast shine as well.<br /><br />Watch this one with a group of friends who like to dissect a film after viewing, you'll have alot to talk about afterwards!

B003405MF6|4.0|I was a fairly loyal fan of Jeff Beck back during the heyday of his productivity spanning the decade from the mid-60s to the mid-70s. Since then, I have been listening to a lot of other styles of music and so he receded for a time in my mind into musical oblivion. But fairly recently, I chanced to hear some of what he is currently doing and liked it. So when Emotion and Commotion was issued, I ordered it immediately. And though Jeff Beck here shows flashes of his old fire, the album also shows us a Beck most of us never knew.  Here's what I like: Hammerhead and Never Alone hark back to the Beck of old. His take on I Put A Spell On You is spellbinding. Serene and Nessun Dorma show a new side to his massive talent. Then there is There's No Other Me featuring the soulful vocals of Joss Stone that ends abruptly just when it threatens to explode.  What didn't I like? Well, I didn't care much for Lilac Wine and Over the Rainbow just sounds out of place. Despite those two, it seems that with the release of Emotion and Commotion that Jeff Beck is back on the scene in a big way.  The CD is housed in a standard jewel box casing and comes with a very attractive multi-page insert containing pictures, lyrics and pertinent album info. Judging by the number of positive reviews, this chapter in Jeff Beck's career has been very well received. I was certainly pleased. Come to this with an open mind and open ears, it's likely to impress you as well.
