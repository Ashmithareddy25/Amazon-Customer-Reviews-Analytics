B008HK3XYK|5.0|I bought a Fire for each of my sons.  One case's grip on the Kindle has loosened over time so it can fall out easily.  This one is still holding strong and has been great.
006198969X|5.0|This book is great! I would get it! I also bought her beauty book also! This book has alot of great tips for women to use!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great family movie especially if you have boys.  It's a movie you can watch again and not get bored with it.  It has some good laughs as well.
0765316978|5.0|The action was fast paced, the touch of  humor, characteristic of Scalzi, excellent and not overpowering, just integral to the appropriate characters.  I cared what happened to these people.
B008602KQI|5.0|These books are great for teens and adults.  My husband, son, and father-in-law tore through this trilogy in a matter of days.  We couldn't put them down.  Luckily all three were out by the time we read them.  I highly recommend these.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I really enjoyed this whole program. The inclusion of a variety of situational pregancies, age groups, and cultural backgrounds made it seem like a bunch of the friends I grew up with were going through pregnancy together. What a hoot!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|If you liked Twilight and Harry Potter you will like these books.  They have some romance aspects to it and content that is better for teens vs kids.  My son and I tore through this series.  Many have said they're a rip off of HP and/or Twilight which I can see but they're still very entertaining.
0143120530|5.0|There is no way to describe this book.  It's a must read for those willing to put in the work to master the techniques.
B001NLL93W|5.0|If you liked Twilight and Harry Potter you will like these books.  They have some romance aspects to it and content that is better for teens vs kids.  My son and I tore through this series.  Many have said they're a rip off of HP and/or Twilight which I can see but they're still very entertaining.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Well I gave it a shot but after it force closed 5 times, startling me back at the beginning each time, I still hadn't even gotten through the tutorial. I have a brand new Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;, there's no excuse for this.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Its so easy to find a movie that's all fluff and pretty with a happy ending, but every now and then you come across one that's totally shocking and honest. I recommend this movie but it is not for the timed viewer.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|if you want a movie to show you excactly what not to do in a survivor experience then this is it.  the Action is slow and predictable and the Drama is weak, it missed at both.
B003AKLFAG|2.0|bad premise. so he was put 15 years in prison for spreading the truth. don't think anyone woulld have done that. also the bad guy himself, let the girl go in the water, justnot a believable idea
B0055SWM08|4.0|It's fun and challenging.  I plan to buy another one of these.  I worry about running out of hints though.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Great Listening, lots or awesome  songs. I listen to this album overtime I work out. If you like Thirty Seconds to Mars you will love this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|The clues are some times too elusive and when you can't figure it out, you are stuck.  I've never played anything so difficult.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It's a decent free game. Nothing spectacular, I actually expected more because of the high rating. I don't understand all the 5 star's on this one. I'm rambling because there is a word count limit.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I'm jus not sure why this book is so loved by so many people. In my opinion. The writing is very disjointed, the cultural references are wrong ( I obviously lived in a different 90's decade that Chbosky) and the characters are dreadful . I hated how Charlie was treated by e erroneous but he is us h a miserable little person it was hard to feel sorry for him.
B009DH379C|4.0|There are several songs from this concert I have not heard in a while.<br />The performance was good.<br />Great voice.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Large choice of game rooms to choose from.  Prizes that can be won or traded between the players. Friendly players if you want to interact. You can form teams to better the odds of getting a prize, coins, power ups etc. Fun gamme...
B00CW665VI|5.0|Excellent! This book is so well written. It is funny, clever,and a joy to read. I want more, more, more from this author. I will be watching for any new books from her, and will purchase them in a heart beat. I love how the story is written from the man's point of view. He is hilarious!
B00A0ABQLM|1.0|The thing worked right out of the box.  When I read the manual, the red LED light should blink if the device is working in USB 3.0 mode - this part is not working.  My tablet only comes with USB 3.0 ports.  I e-mailed technical support during Anker's business hours, but no response.  This thing is going back.<br />---------------------------<br />Update June 11, 2013:  The Company contacts me regarding my issue.  I am impressed that they do care and that is a good thing.  My review for the product stands though.  I would give five stars for customer service, but unfortunately, I already returned the product.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|IS FUN TO PLAY BUT YOUR REALLY NEED THE CASH OPTIONS TO GET AHEAD. PLAN ACCORDINGLY. DON'T GET CORNERED WHEN FIGHTING.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice to grab when your on a long ride or before bed. Solitare has always been a good game for me as I am not really a game person.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I love the message of the book. It's great to be witty and smart, don't be superficial and don't marry a bum! Also, the illustrations are great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it so much that I couldn't wait to get back to reading it on my breaks at work and on my lunch. I'm going to rent the movie this weekend and order more of his books.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|A must see for all families. Beautiful story - 1st I'm crying and then I'm laughing. Very moving and funny.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|This version of Spiderman is just awful. Charging more than what I paid, .99 cents is just a total rip off. The dark knight rises however was phenomenal(also by Gameloft) and is worth whatever you pay. Check it out.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Amazing how le Carré manages to adapt his stories to the world's realities which seem to be changing faster every year.<br />A brilliant read, as usual.
B000WCDI64|5.0|I loved this DVD of Amy Winehouse's performance. During this performance, her father and husband are in the audience.  I like how she gazes up at her husband during some of the songs.  A must have for all Amy Winehouse fans!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I love the SSTB series and was anxiously awaiting the last book.  Unfortunately this did not live up to the rest.  The storyline was flat and unexciting.  It did not have any of the action that the other books did.  Sad that this is how it ended.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I loved it!  I must have for any Amy Winehouse fan!  This recording captures her soul and raw power.  I also liked her back up band.  I'm not sure if guys that she always tours with.  It is just so sad that she was taken so young :(
B002GIBVWA|5.0|if you love Keanu reeves, this is the movie for you.  nice drama and reeves does an excellent job too
B00797MB0O|4.0|Loved the believability of Theron.  I have to tell you I can't remember how it ended therefore the story made an impression up till the ending.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|This book is very fun and crazy! I liked the book a lot and I recommend it to kids 8 or 9 and higher
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie had a great premise. I felt the story plot got weakened when all of sudden the civilization has now changed it's thinking about the star struck youths. The movie led one to believe that society now acts with the hunger games mentality because it works for them. Over all the years the hunger games has existed no ounce of humanity has crept in to make the games barbaric and now all of a sudden here it is. So bottom line I thought it entertaining but hard to believe.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish it was a bit faster when starting but other than that it's fabulous. This game is great and anyone can play it.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|it was a constant surprise!  it kept me sitting on the edge of my chair... the acting was phenomenal and the finale was brilliant!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It just keeps getting more interesting. Continues to keep the reader enthralled & begging for more. Can't wait for the next one!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Deborah Harkness and I loved it! I bought the second book in the series before I even finished the first. Great read. The author has a wonderful sense of adventure and an abundance of imagination.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the accuracy that it provides and the unique display it offers.<br />But it is not very accurate with the time remaining which often annoys me.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|What else can be said about these masters of their craft! They have made an disc of songs that ranks up there, with their best!
B008R6MI8G|3.0|The storyline is about a little known historical individual and for that the movie was worthwhile for me to watch.  However, the movie lacked a cohesiveness and wandered aimlessly at times.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it almost daily.  I can keep information synced between my iPhone, iPad and home computer.  I can pull up information that I use regularly anywhere, including lists and books I want to purchase.
0988262592|4.0|This novel provided only a glimpse into one IT shop's journey to align with the business - but it was a good tour.  I think the story will help IT learn to work closer with the business and in particular help DevOps gain a spotlight.  I could not put it down once I got to chapter 3.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A fun book to read. My only complaint is that it's way too short. Can't wait for the movie. Hopefully it won't be too much of a let down from the book.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I saw this in the theater and I was entertained. I thought it was a cool movie. It's obviously not Shakespeare and admittedly I like sci-fi stuff but I think if you don't set your expectations too high, you won't be disappointed. I recommend renting it or if you are a die-hard sci-fi fan, buy it for the extra content (if it comes with any of course, which I'm sure it will).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app ha  literally changed my life, as a modern day plumber this helps me to lay my pipe efficiently and effectively
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My fianc&eacute; introduced me to Dr. Who earlier this year and it has been such fun to get to watch all the episodes. Love that Amazon has them included in Prime!
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Had a big name company picked this up and had a different director, this could have been bigger than twilight. I loved the book series and this movie was a botched attempt of the first book. Characters were not as they were in the books, important things were left out or not explained. Disgrace to the writers of the series.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|Helps me get alll my stuff at one placr. There no need to download all my pic in other devices I hv. I can get them from here n is easy to get it
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again!  I enjoyed this book like a 5 course meal...taking time between servings to let the flavors sink in and enjoy.  I could have simply gobbled it down in one serving it was so delicious, but because of his past work...I knew I would regret rushing through the meal.  I marked about 20 different pages in the book where Hosseini's sentences simply took my breath away...and sometimes caused instant tears. I only wish Hosseini had become a writer earlier in life....so I'd have more than three books on my top shelf!
B00820N2JG|2.0|Boy what a surprise this movie was, if you have kids don't let them watch it. At first I thought that using puppets to make a movie might prove interesting. In the beginning it was interesting to see how they moved the puppets around but it went downhill from there. I don't mind cussing and swearing in most action films but this one got carried away with it. Then the huge surprise a sex scene that was over the top at least in my eyes. It might as well have been a porn film. In the end it was typical the world was saved and the population was none the wiser for the plot they stopped.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Steve Wilson is genius. I love the first track's approach. and check out the watch maker, the lyrics is so intelegently written...I took my daughter to see Steve Wilson at the best buy theater in NYC last May...can't wait to see a dvd or bluray release on this tour I hope...I recommend it...
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|...but this felt more like homework. You will probably need to watch it twice or bring a notepad and take notes.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Its really good except that i really hate games that take like 2 hours build stuff. Other than that it has AMAZING  graphics and it's not hard to earn cash. It does require internet but thats ok. Wouls recommend this to anyone has time to kill and can only play a bit or alot a day.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I'm sure kids will like it, but the pace of the movie was glacial in the middle and Reilly and Silverman didn't have enough funny lines to keep it lively. Too bad, it had a lot of potential!
B008JB9NOG|5.0|I also went to great lengths to buy this album on Vinyl.  The forgotten album by The Smashing Pumpkins that is very underrated.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Ok so the production is loaded with autotune. In the long and short of things I couldn't just say I like it. That wouldn't be true. I love it because it contains memories from a great concert in a fantastic year from my favorite band. So sue me!
B000002KDO|5.0|This album is for anyone that has any affiliate with music in general.  You can't like music unless you like Black Sabbath.
B000001ELR|5.0|i love this cd very much i am very pleased with this cd thank you so much for haveing this
B00C70FH7M|5.0|Every aspect of this transaction could not have gone any better.  There really isn't anything else to say about it.
B00BU987C8|5.0|cant want to have this cd delivered to my house cant wait for it to be here thanks so much
B004JST27Q|5.0|This album is so great. So great, that I have 2 copies.  Only reason really is because one wouldn't burn.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Little slow to start but good story line.  The American people have no idea how long it takes to accomplish covert missions or to find someone that is that well hidden.
B00138F080|5.0|I am now listening to this album and are very pleased with what I bought for the amount that I paid.
B004J64QSI|5.0|None of the movies do the book justice, but this is a horse of another colour.<br />Broadway at its best, right in your living room.
B009YU62H2|3.0|Glad to see these guys still putting out music.  Recently saw them at Rock on The Range in Columbus, OH.
B00005IC2H|3.0|The cd skips, I like it for what it is not the condition it arrived in I  will not be recommending this seller to a single person.
B000WQW988|5.0|I think I missed the original broadcast of this in 1993, but I do remember frequently seeing clips of different songs aired as music videos.  Nirvana's Unplugged is not only the best edition of Unplugged, but one of the true great live performances.  As many other reviews have noted, the majority of the songs performed by Nirvana weren't particularly well-known songs by the band except for \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Polly\\", and several of the songs are actually covers of other artists' songs.  In fact, for years I thought \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" was a Nirvana song.  Some of the best songs are covers of Meat Puppets songs, \\"Plateau\\" and \\"Lake of Fire\\".  This DVD is great, since it includes both the broadcast version and the original unaired version with all 14 songs.  Highly recommended for any Nirvana fan (or any fan of good music, really).
B00846F1YW|1.0|I love hidden object games on facebook, but this is just too small to see.  Even with glasses I am unable to play on my kindle fire.
B00947N6UG|5.0|My daughter is 3 and LOVES this movie!  We rented it several weeks ago, and she had to own it!  My husband and I like it too!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I agree with the other disappointed readers.<br /><br />This book felt like a cheap placebo, both to make money for the author and publisher, and to appease the eager fans who wanted closure in this third issue of the trilogy.  It's a failure on all levels.  Not only was there no closure, but what there was isn't well-written.  Eva and Gideon screwing like rabbits with no real romance or heat, no resolution to ANY of the issues that made them an interesting couple and finally giving Cary's storyline more depth only to be left hanging.<br /><br />The secret marriage is a pacifier to string the suckers along and I hope it backfires.  The next (and hopefully final) installment should be free to make up for the insult of \\"Entwined with You\\".
B00CM96A60|5.0|Very solid release by AVB.  Good balance of vocal and melodic, showy mainstream tunes and tracks that are composed more for self-listening. Really a little something for everyone.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I liked this game but would not play it too often it kind of hypes me up and that is not always a good thing
1878424319|4.0|I am an aspiring Social Worker that someday hopes to counsel people in times of a crisis. But before that happens I hope to do a little self discovery and engage in a little counseling and self reflection of my own. This book is an excellent start. It is very simple in terms of language and stories featured. It presents 4 concepts and all are pretty obvious and familiar but they remind you why you have NOT engaged in these agreements in a powerful and soul-searching kind of way. Very short book as I was able to finish it in one afternoon. Highly recommend it if you are wanting to learn more about yourself or if you wish to give it as a graduation gift.
B00A757EFW|4.0|reminds me of when my children were young and I would watch them play Pac-Man they just loved the game.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We really enjoyed the movie.  Any movie, with Tom Cruise in it, is going to be great.  Nice to see it in the comfort of our home.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I could spend hours playing this game it also keeps me thinking and helps with memory and quick movements it is fun
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Megadeth is by far one of my favorite bands. One of the things I like is their constant willingness to keep albums coming out in a short time span. This is how it was in the past with bands. Metallica, tool , they take six years or more. Not megadeth. Having said that I will say not all of megadeth's albums have been great. Risk was rather dreadful. United Abominations, and The System has Failed equally horrid. Endgame was awesome, 13 not so much...but I will say Super Collider is by far the best megadeth album bar none. I've never had a megadeth album where I liked every song. Countdown to Extinction came close, but their latest romp is amazing from start to finish. The songs fit nice. They rock hard and go heavy.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|The music and lyrics stay with you and are unforgettable.  His intrumental skill and musicality and wonderful.  Could listen to his music all day.
0156034026|4.0|Told as a one-sided conversation, it conveys the subtle ironic tone of the narrator and made me wonder what would motivate the listener to hang in there through almost 200 pages of a rambling story. Nevertheless, the importance of its core topic is undeniable.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|If you're interested in exploring human emotions surrounding death and funerals, then go no further.<br />However, I liked exploring a world where humans analyse their behaviour and thinking towards alien species.<br />Ender is a likeable character, but I would have preferred it if it had been harder for him to get along with the new community that he moved into.  He had it too easy.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was awesome! I think she is in every different  chapter moving closer and farther reproach of them! WHO IS SHE GONNA PICK!!!!  O_O<br />  - Bianca
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great story.  Great writer.  Well planned and no unnecessary romance.<br />It reminded me of Ender's Game; I empathised with the boy who realises that the world isn't all as he is taught.
0805047905|5.0|My 2 year old granddaughter never seems to tire of this book. She has me read it to her everyday sometimes 6 or 7 times! She really loves it and I love watching her eyes get big as I read and show her the animals. I would like to see more books like this. It also holds up to a lot of play and page turning.
B00C7GY8Y4|5.0|This is a great CD. Jessie Ware is now one of my favorite artists. I love every song on the album.
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|I liked this documentary very much. It contains excellent information about the foods we eat. It is eye-opening to see how our meat is handled.
B0044IABFS|5.0|the whole series is great...worth watching.  Highly recommend.  Some episodes are not appropriate for kids.  All seasons are worth watching.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I have my wonderful 8 cores of happiness. Haven't done much in the way of OC yet, but that's for after I get liquid cooling for it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my bro has a sanding tablet and I have a kf but he got the update and I didn't yet.  If they get the update for kindle then it would be five stars
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Beautifully written, I felt like I was there on the farm, there in the orphanage, there in the hotel. Equally funny & heartbreaking. An all around good read. Thank you.
B00A4AHZZO|3.0|I love Otto Klemperer's conducting and looked forward to this set, but I find it an awkwardly organized collection poorly laid out across the 8 discs. Those performances previously available on CD have not been remastered freshly here, and the sound quality within each disc is variable. The symphonies have also been irregularly separated with overtures and serenades here and there throughout. Frankly, I don't want to listen to the &#34;Cosi Fan Tutte&#34; overture when I want to hear Symphony #25, have the &#34;Adagio and Fugue K546&#34; come in between Symphony #25 and #29, or have &#34;Eine keline Nachtmusik&#34; shoved in before I hear #39! I am frustrated by this collection. Unless you're a music student who wants a collection of random Mozart laid out in no particular order and are willing to click within discs every time you want to hear a particular piece, I don't recommend this set.  A much more enjoyable collection is the earlier, better organized and still available &#34;Great Recordings of the Century&#34; 2-disc packaging of the better versions of Klemperer's #29, #35, #38, #39, #40, and #41. These are the same masterings of these symphonies used in the current box set. #36 is missing in the earlier collection, but I've always thought it one of Klemperer's misses as a performance. It sounds as if he had a bad day when it was recorded -the performance is over-driven and inorganic in the relationship of its parts. I do highly recommend the 2-disc package.  It's Klemperer at his best throughout, and you'll be glad to listen to the whole set repeatedly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dear, Amazon I don&quot;t quit understand why Apple and Android has the update before us it's not fair we payed just as much money we should have it by now. I love minecraft and I would like to play with my friends again. It won't let me connect because it says my device is OUTDATED. I hope you read this and realize that this is quite unfair that we don't have UPDATE. Please fix this update soon.<br /><br />  - Anonymous
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|its good but if you don't have any gems it is not that fun because you cant upgrade anything or get a new iron man
B006Y5H74W|3.0|There is not now nor will there ever be anyone convincing enough or good enough to play Marilyn.  The singing and dancing was great, and entertaining but, No Marilyn in this group.  Nice try though!
B0094K1QR8|3.0|I feel this movie was given more hype than it should have received.  It was uneven and very slow paced.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|So disappointed with ending. I love this story line, the characters, etc however,<br />I'm glad I checked this book out at the public library instead of spending ten dollars.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I would recommend Carlos' latest CD to all his music-starved fans.....it's fresh, happy, upbeat music....he's definitely back! Keep it coming, Mr. Vives!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101 in 1 games offers so many different games that there is something that will surely appeal to everyone in the household.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Brilliant  production featururing talented actors is absolutely transporting.  Few variances from from original storyline make for a spell-binding story. Glorious.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a very handy app. It really works well given the power of the camera flash. It's not good for distance, but provides adequate light in a close situation.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great read.  Real page turner with lots of twist and turns, you think you know all the answers and then a twist or a turn.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Doesn't have the best selection!! You need to tell amazon that they need updates. It also needs wolves,redstone minable , rollercoaster. And most of all UPDATES
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Once you start you cannot stop watching this show, it's amazing! I cannot wait until the next season, it seems so far away.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Another interpretation of the Holmes storyline but this time set in 21st Century London. A great job with excellent acting.  I'm guessing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have approved... (-:
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A fabulous movie my grandson has been watching this movie since he was 2 and he is 13 now!!! We had to replace the DVD finally!!!
1881273873|4.0|Great book with lots of pertinent examples to show how to apply the languages in our day to day life.
B006O6EOII|5.0|My daughter had been bugging me for this doll and I saw the price drop and picked it up right away.  She saw the movie with this doll and had been asking for it ever since.  It doesn't come with accessories like some of the other MH dolls, but it does come with what you see already on her.  The helmet is even shaped like a brain!  A great buy for any MH fan!
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|Loved season 1-6, but now it's making a turn for &#34;Guiding Light&#34; or something similar. I wish it would go back to being about a vigilante serial killer and not a love story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|try it people it is asome! I am 7 years old and get to play with horses every day. I play for hours and don't get bored
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It was alright as a game.  I played it several times and do not any longer.  There are other games that I find more challenging.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was suppose to be a trilogy. I wanted a happily ever after. The storyline is great. But come on where is the ending.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The cards are large.  I would recommend this game.  Its a real fun game.  The way I remember solitiare to be
B005R32L66|4.0|It is not as easy to get people on the list as the pc version but still a good app for traveling.
B009X01C64|4.0|This case protects my Kindle fire HD.  The stand works out very well.  No problem charging my kindle.  All ports available.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|i loved this series its so good  ....i love series so this one is a winner ..awesome series i loved it
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Can't say anything but it's a bond movie and it's yet another good one.  The retro throwback in the movie was one of the best parts.  Would watch it again.
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|This movie is not along the story line that many other zombie movies and television shows are. I do give the movie credit for going away from what everyone else is doing right now it's just so unbelievable that it makes the movie hard to really get into. There isn't enough action to keep your mind from thinking about all the things that are just so unreal :-( I wish I could get my time back, it would have been so much better spent sleeping than a date night with my husband :-( Don't bother with this flick!
B00CL68NOG|2.0|expected this to be funnier and instead it was a predictable movie with only one or two laughs.  Not what i was expecting.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If I could have just one game on my KINDLE it would be Quell. I recommend this game to everybody.<br />The graphics are great, music is relaxing, and the difficulty makes you think while not<br />Being impossibly difficult.
B000P12LWY|3.0|England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.<br /><br />However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen - the Emperor's aunt - apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce. When he falls in love with the beautiful Anne Boleyn, this matter becomes pressing and threatens a breakdown of relations with Rome.<br /><br />The Tudors is a television drama produced by the Showtime network and based on the life on Henry VIII, focusing on his relationships with his six wives and the political and religious turmoil that resulted. The first season covers a period of roughly eleven years, running from the accession of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor (in 1519) to the death of Cardinal Wolsey (in 1530). However, real historical events are compressed, combined or moved around in the timeline to read better as part of the drama. The contentious marriage of Charles Brandon to Henry's sister Mary Tudor (slightly confusingly changed to Margaret in the TV series) happened in 1515, but is moved to later on to create an interesting mid-season subplot, for example.<br /><br />The Tudors plays fast-and-loose with the details of real history, but like HBO's Rome before it, the show does succeed in getting across the events and complications of the period. The complexities of Henry's relationships with fellow European rulers and the Pope are recounted well, as is the seething tensionwithin the English court. As a very rough introduction to the history of the period, The Tudors works, though those interested in the real events are referred to the many history books about the time.<br /><br />As drama and narrative, The Tudors is something of a mixed bag. The script is inclined towards the expositionary, with surprisingly little incidental flavour, and what there is is often questionable: a scene showing Henry VIII composing 'Greensleeves' is amusing but also cheesy and highly inaccurate (Henry VIII definitely did not write the music to the song and his authorship of the lyrics is questionable, at best). One of the strongest episodes in the season is the one where England is ravaged by disease, as it shows how Tudor England coped with such disasters and features more incidental scenes of life amongst the common folk than other episodes.<br /><br />The acting is mostly good, with the likes of Nick Dunning (Sir Thomas Boleyn) and Henzy Czerny (the Duke of Norfolk) providing able support. Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon and, more recently, the latest actor to play Superman) is good as one of Henry's few true friends, though he arguably may have made a better Henry VIII himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Catherine of Aragorn, mixing palpable fear and worry over not being able to give the king an heir with pride and anger at the thought of being set aside. Natalie Dormer is given the hard job of portraying Anne Boleyn, the woman a king plunged a nation into anarchy for, and almost pulls it off. She is hamstrung by the indifferent script, especially as the story skips large chunks of their courtship and the precise reasons for the king's fascination with her are left somewhat ambiguous: in the TV show she simply appears to play hard to get, fascinating the king who normally just has to nod his head to get a woman into bed with him. Given their seven-year courtship and the intensity of Henry's feelings towards her, this feels rather inadequate as an explanation.<br /><br />Central to this first season is Sam Neill, who plays Cardinal Wolsey with just the right mix of intelligence, political scheming and ruthless anger. Wolsey is presented as something of an antagonistic figure, but he is also shown to be a caring family man (Wolsey had a wife and two children) and to be utterly devoted to the king. As Wolsey repeatedly fails to get the annulment Henry wants, he becomes more desperate and Neill portrays Wolsey's descent with passion and intensity. Neill is possibly the highlight of the first season. Jeremy Northam also gives an excellent performance as Sir Thomas More, highlighting both More's well-known piety, intelligence and integrity but also his darker side, such as his commitment to burning heretics and Protestants at the stake.<br /><br />Where the series falters - and it's quite a big misstep - is the casting of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in the central role of Henry VIII. Eight years prior to The Tudors, Rhys-Meyers had played the coldly cunning role of Steerpike in the BBC's adaptation of Gormenghast, and bizarrely he seems to be playing Henry VIII in much the same manner. The real Henry VIII is noted for his charisma and vivaciousness, his force of personality sweeping up those around him. Whilst Rhys-Meyers certainly nails the king's intelligence, confidence and raging temper when thwarted, his performance is also often cold, desperate and occasionally whiny. I can understand the idea of subverting the traditional image of the fat, middle-aged Henry VIII by showing him as a young man in the prime of life, but Rhys-Meyers simply fails to get across the complexities of the real historical figure.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is not quite as disastrous as it might be supposed: The Tudors may be about Henry VIII, but the series follows those around him more than the monarch himself, and the emphasis is on the court and period as a whole rather than on the one man by himself.<br /><br />From a technical viewpoint, the series is well-directed. The use of CGI to flesh out the castles and stately homes of England is interesting and rather ahead of its time (and makes up for the fact that the show was filmed in Ireland, with limited or no access to some of the real locations portrayed in the series), though also sometimes distracting. Early in the season we have relatively brief camera shots of locations that try not to dwell on their computer-generated nature. Later in the season we have rather distracting rapid camera movements and broad shots of locations which are clearly CGI and artificial (and whilst the CGI is good for 2007 and the show's limited budget, it's still not great), creating a bit of a dissonance once we switch to the live-action scenes.<br /><br />The first season of The Tudors (***) is flashy, fun and enjoyable but also lightweight. The lack of historical accuracy is not a major problem - the show at least portrays the real events, if not always in the right order or with the correct details - though the uncharismatic performance of the lead actor and a sometimes indifferent and flavourless script certainly are. Luckily, most of the other actors are excellent and as a rough introduction to the time period and events, the show does work.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Compared to other war movies, this one gives viewers more sense of the depths of what people -- soldiers and their families -- went through.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is a wonderful cartoon for kids as well as adults.  The humor is very clever, there's no need to understand the language becuase none of the characters talk anyway!  My favorite is Shaun himself, although Blitzer is funny too!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Basic but helps you gauge your usage.  Was worth it as a free app, but I would have paid for it.
0812983459|5.0|This book is deceptively simple because it's messages are so profound -- and communicated so subtly. Everyone I've recommended it to has also loved it, and our book club has now chosen it. Reading it was a real treat! I'm trying to cull my library so I don't buy many books anymore -- I have way too many! -- but this one definitely is a keeper.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is definately worth a try, you can use different vehicles and all the levels are unique and fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is very amazingly awesome and very addictive but still very fun and entertaining. I Garrentty you will love this game.

B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Although Arnold has aged, he can still act.  He plays a sheriff with a good humor.  He takes a stand against intruders to his small town and it is great.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Was never a Star Trek fan until I saw this. Not only did it start from the beginning (as most new reboots do) but also made me want to go watch the old originals. Great movie and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel (Into Darkness) is even better. Enjoy
B007N8RULO|5.0|i love this game. I can play for hours. try it and you'll be hooked. I give it 5 stars.

1451683405|5.0|It's an interesting way to look at free will. I mean, this shouldn't be taken as the end all answer.  But I like Sam Harris's idea about it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I think that flow is a great logic game. It stimulates your mind to figure out how to complete the board. I hope you get this game. It will be addicting! Good luck on completing all of the packs!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the beginning to end. Adam Brown, the hero of this story, loved others more than himself and his selfless life was not only unusual but very inspirational.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I read the synopsis and looked at the previews.  I was hoping to see this in the theater when it was out but didn't get around to it.  I'm glad I didn't spend the money.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and I think he did a good job of illustrating his character.  But, the story lacked the depth I expected and was disjointed.  It just wasn't what I expected.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Pretty bad acting and directing all the way through. Cruise is so full of himself, it makes the thing unwatchable. 2 hours of my life i will never get back.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It challenges you to think ahead before making connections. I just started playing it and got stuck playing for an hour.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes scifi. All characters were great. The Tatiana Maslany made the series.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I think this is great so addictive,reminds me of the late 80's with the space invaders. Even my grand kids love it.Its awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, so I am 12 years old and I am a girl. This game is made for anyone and everyone. The game is great and tons of fun with survival and creative! There are lots of great features now that it updated. Buckets, spawn eggs (in creative), etc. Even though the game costs 7.00$ it's worth it! I totally recommend this game for everyone no matter your age or gender! Enjoy!
B008QTUA5W|1.0|Frankly, I am VERY disappointed in this show. The main actress  can't say 3 words w/o using the f word, the s word, or JC. She is a foul mouthed creature & her acting is poor. About every 4th scene is T & A-boobs flopping around, etc. BORING!  And...childish. Incredibly, there is even a masterbation scene in season 1! It is so bad that the f word is actually used 3 times in the opening credits! A very crass, tasteless & snoozer of a show.  A poor director usually sticks in nudity to sell a poor show just to sell it. This is exactly the situation here. The plot is so phoney & flawed that it is nearly absurd. A Marine is captured, tortured & then becomes a muslim & a terrorist. Riiiiiiight! Other than the fact that this has never happened & never would the plot is just fine. Name one Marine that would see his fellow grunts killed & then turn muslim & terrorist. It ain't a gonna happen. Then, to add to this foul brew, it turns out that the CIA chick is psychotic! Now I could see this if they were the prez or a politician...but the CIA? For crying out loud, they would find this out, even if they couldn't pick up 911 or the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lewis is quite wooden & so brittle as an actor in this film that if he fell down he would break. His co-star is even worse. Frankly, she is a worse actor ran Demi Moore, if possible. This is just about the most unrealistic show in this genre that I've ever seen. For example, the CIA building has HUGE windows so enemy spies can hear conversations via electronic devices. Then Lewis is show yelling at his captain about \\"fighting his bulls...war\\" as if this would really happen in the military. If so, he'd be on KP for the rest of his known life. Predictably, the Marine's best friend is shanking his wife & the gal's CIA bosses let her get away w/ murder w/o any consequences. RIIIIIGHT! I want my money back.  Frankly, there is no motive for Lewis to be a turncoat & this show defines the worst of Hollywood. Please, go see something else! This show isn't worth the paper the script is written on.
0156027321|5.0|for $1.99 - shipping, if this book was used, it was only read once.<br />that it came from a non-profit  that helps adults with developmental disabilities was icing on the cake.<br />not only did i get exactly what i wanted, it seems i did a good deed!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Excellent movie.  Really got it right taking a book to the big screen!!  Never quite sure who dun it until the end.  Too bad Tom Cruise was in it. . .but we managed to move passed that only flaw.
0345444051|5.0|having never bought a &#34;used&#34; book on-line, i wasn't sure what to expect (having been in used bookstores before, i wasn't sure if it would 5, 10, or 20 years old.<br />i could've gone to a bookstore and bought one in the same condition.  that i didn't have to leave the house to do so was a bonus.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Good plot, interesting and well written, but clogged with fillers and slow moving. I felt like I was trapped in a Cirque Du Soliel show and couldn't get out.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Lots of puzzles, so there is a good variety of fun. Have only played about six different puzzles but can't wait to play more.<br /><br />Great graphics are good too.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I thought I was knowledgeable about nutrition and quality of food, but I was wrong. This book was an absolute eye-opener about the role of Big Food in the current obesity epidemics. Coincidentally, I had just started a slow carb diet (no processed food, no starches, no sugars), and I could feel myself getting healthier (and slimmer), validating many of the points of this book. Well researched and written, with the right balance between facts and anecdotes. Highly recommended.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Fantastic scenery, elaborate sets,faboulous & spot on actors, true to the era, best of all &#34;Great story line!&#34;. Can not stop waatching!!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Don't believe some people who say, that you need more powerful or newer cpu for heavy apps like games for example. This unit easily works with any demanding game (Crysis 3 e.g.) If smth. goes wrong, upgrade your video card and ram. That is it.

B006YTTVHO|4.0|informative book,, has some good tips on how to approach situations and communicate with people, well worth reading this book
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Holy mother of god this is amazing. I haven't read any comic better than this. So good probably as good as the show maybe even better. Happy I bought the second also.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I devoured the first two Crossfire novels, I mean devoured them, I couldn't put them down until I was finished reading them.  I waited impatiently for this 3rd book to be released, then I saw the ridiculous  price, I decided that I would wait, but curiosity got the best of me.  I downloaded the book on Tuesday, and when I was 11% into the story, I was soon wanting the bedroom scene to just be over.  I was so bored that I didn't bother picking up the book until Thursday and not finishing it until Friday.  I'm not against erotica, but it was tiresome to see the sex scenes repeated over and over.  For any reader that has read the first 2 books, we already know that Gideon is well-endowed, we don't need the same descriptions of how thick it is, or that it spurts a lot. We get that, we've known that since Book 1, what we didn't know was how the Nathan incident was going to pan out, and apparently it wasn't important enough to resolve in this book. There are so many sex scenes and so few scenes with other characters.  Her father's visit was over very quickly, and the outcome of an incident that occurred during his visit was pushed aside.<br /><br />Bottom line, the sex scenes are fillers for this book so that the issues and plots from the first two books can be dragged out to complete the next two Crossfire books.  Other than Eva feeling more secure in her relationship with Gideon, very little has changed.  Cary is still dating both Trey and Tatiana, Corinne still mourning for Gideon, Eva's mom still trying to track her, and Brett is still harboring feelings for Eva.<br /><br />I hope that the publishers are happy with my $10 for this book, because it is the last dollar that I will spend on this series.  The book being just mediocre isn't what angers me, it's the greediness.  I also think that the book was filled with sex scenes so that there would be enough material to finish the next two books. Most readers wanted to see the how the twists and plots from Book 2 would end, they were barely addressed. This series went from being one of my favorite to being a series of sell-out and greed.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app so easy to use and way faster then texting awesome job on this app......i will definitely recommended
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Leaves you with the challenge of &#34;what is of value&#34; for each of us!  What makes life worth living......and what defines  who we are and where we are headed.  Should we be able to make these decisions?

B000FCK65W|5.0|This is an account of immigrant life which can be applied to any immigrant group in the modern era. Although somewhat dated, this book still tells the story of any immigrant group in America. There is some algeresque romanticizing, but the overall story holds true.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The entire story is incredibly bittersweet. Amazing to remember that this is a story of children not allowed a childhood and forced into greatness nonetheless. I am so curious to see how the movie turns out.
0316223239|5.0|At first, delving into Room was difficult. The narrative is told from the perspective of a 5 year old boy. As with all small children, Jack, the story's main character, has scattered thoughts and an innocent perspective on life. The storyline is revealed early in Jack's story that he and his mother are living in a tiny room equipped with a wardrobe, stove and tiny kitchen area. They are being held captive, but since Jack has never lived anywhere other than in 'Room', he doesn't know that anything out of the ordinary is taking place. This book is moving and insightful. I'm sure Ms. Donoghue did extensive research on childhood behavior/thought processes as well as what kidnapped and/or persons being held captive go through physically and psychologically. She really nails the emotions and innocence of young Jack and the survival instincts and protective nature of his mother. This is not a happy, feel-good type of book. But it will definitely get you thinking and remind you to appreciate the little things in life
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|It is fun to play and has good graphics that make my eyes go all squiggy and bonk bonk. Twenty
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I use it to learn how to repair things around the house. If I have any technical questions it is the first place I go.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like this RPG ALOT. I used to play World of Warcraft, but don't have a regular computer set up right now. This game has come the closest to WoW for me. I really enjoy playing this one.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|I really don't get the visceral reaction to this film by so many - precisely *because* it's a standard sci-fi apocalypse pic.  I hear no such groans over the studio-produced tropes of the SyFy Channel, yet somehow this particular film \\"fails\\" for following the same trajectory. It's a potboiler plot with the standard clique of characters in a survivalist struggle of the quickest. The special effects were interesting, if not of blockbuster quality.  The \\"unseen alien\\" is an old low-budget gimmick, but as they go this one *was* creative. There are certain Russian touches: the urban partisans holding out a la Stalingrad, fighting for the Motherland, etc. I suspect one reason the film is \\"offensive\\" is precisely due to this, while the ability to film a standard sci-fi in a world urban center with such cooperation made a convincing stage normally lacking in Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />One reviewer took its producers to task because at one point the aliens could crack glass, while at another they were blinded by it. This all depends on the force of the electromagnetic wave, hence the ability of Sergei's Farraday cage to deflect individual alien predators.  All in all not bad for the buck. Its unique  features in an English-speaking production - the Muscovite landscape and characterization - seem to have made it \\"truly alien\\" for some viewers in their over-reaction to this one.
B00BQLSB3A|5.0|The Christine Blu-ray has no new special features, just an HD transfer. Pop your dvd copy in to your blu ray player on your HD tv and it will look almost as good as a blu ray. Save your money until a mass produced blu ray edition is released.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Super entertaining with tons of comic relief. Yes old schoolers its not the same but then it was never meant to be just like the original so get over it and buy this. You won't be disappointed.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Although this novel is confusing in places because it moves among different times, places, and points of view, it is beautifully written and thought provoking: the quality of life in North Korea, life in the concentration camps, the formation of a conscience, the power of evil and the power of love.  It brought out so many emotions: horror, fear, fascination, sorrow,and empathy.  I couldn't stop reading it,and I can't stop thinking about it.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I've always liked playing Shadow of the Colossus, and was interested in playing ICO, this combination of games is a great way for me to play both.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A dark story about a relationship that has fallen apart. But who is the saint and who is the sinner? Gillian Flynn is an accomplished wordsmith who has crafted this mystery and suspense story with an admirable attention to plot and to detail. Having said that, if you like every aspect of a mystery to stand up to critical analysis, you may need to suspend your analytical tendencies as regards the robustness of some parts of the resolution of the story.<br />I stayed up for five hours last night to finish it, so it qualifies as a page turner on my scale. You know from the outset that Flynn is playing with your expectations, yet she still surprises you at (almost) every turn.<br />The story is told in alternating chapters from the POV of Nick, the husband, and Amy, the wife. A golden couple that have fallen, it seems, on hard times. The focus of the story is Amy's sudden and unexplained disappearance, with signs of foul play that point unerringly at Nick. But is Amy dead, and is Nick really a killer?<br />I loved the book; my only suggestion to Mrs Flynn would be that she draws out the denouement. The book could, and in my opinion should, have ended earlier and more dramatically. Maybe she has a sequel in mind...
B002UZCJP2|5.0|I bought this because I lost my original DVD copy.  It's a great movie, a little scary thinking how people could act like the people in the movie, but still a great movie.

B008FYZIVY|1.0|So pissed that these set are missing scenes. It stated the complete season 1 & 2 but they are not complete. Missing crucial scenes like the death of the Turkish ambassador; how he died and the concealing of his body. All of it is missing. I will NEVER, EVER buy a DVD on Amazon again!!!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I liked the classic story of the underdog being misunderstood.  This movie brought out the strict and rigid caste rules of the 50's and how one couple's love for each other broke that down.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I like this game but it is pretty hard to complete a puzzle.  I have only completed about three different puzzle since I've been playing this.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Loved the movie and loved the music.  I purchased the 25th anniversary edition of the CD with the book.  This CD makes you feel good.

B004ADH1RI|4.0|My son loved this movie and watched it over and over.  It has a good moral story and a lot of humor.  My son always picked up favorite phrases and sayings from movies he liked and in this one, it was &#34;rocky road&#34;.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a really fun game but it needs some redstone and rails and stuff like that it also needs flint and steel on creative if they had those on creative and survival it would be even better
B0000542DJ|5.0|Even though Oliver Stone took some liberties with the facts, I still like this movie.  I lived through those times and I am a history buff.  I have seen every documentary every made on the JFK assassination and I have always felt it was a conspiracy.  To hear Robert Blakey echo my thoughts on the Mafia (and having lived in Louisiana my entire life), this movie fascinates me.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The world almost as if in a dream, with clear contrast to the reality of difficult everyday existence. A completely engaging first work.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Obviously, this movie is a classic and I wanted to own it.  I was a teenager when it came out and Steve McQueen was one of my favorite actors.  There are very few movies being made now that I even go see but I will watch a classici like this over and over.
B00C1N9JWO|2.0|Many of Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling novels--those from the start of this series--are exemplary of the best we can hope for from PNR (paranormal romance, the genre into which Ms Singh's work falls). Indeed, even though Heart of Obsidian is a terrible book, Singh's prose remains far and away better than every other writer in the genre, and possibly in romance today.<br /><br />Good prose aside, this novel has so many problems that it is only possible to go through them in list format.<br /><br />1. Boring. Oh God, so boring.<br />The pacing of this behemoth will leave you panting. That is, you'll be panting for something new to happen to way someone lost in a featureless wasteland pants for water as he crawls along on all fours. Singh has always struggled a bit with the creation of suspense--she likes to draw things out, and that can be all right, but not in Heart of Obsidian, in which big \\"events\\" take place often, but only in the most predictable manner possible. Oh, is there a catastrophic world event taking place again? And the impossibly powerful hero is once again shrugging his shoulders as he remains motionless, solving all problems with his brain? Oh, yes, that was exciting. Let's do that again two pages from now.<br /><br />2. Emotionless hero<br />I love a good gamma hero, or even just a total jerk hero who seems to lack emotions but reveals them enticingly now and then. Sadly, Kaleb is mostly a robot. It's not that he doesn't emote--it's that he hardly seems to feel at all. Even when Singh describes him admitting that he would \\"rage\\" and \\"destroy the world\\" if Sahara had died, the reader finds it very difficult to believe this slab-faced automaton could manage such an excess of feeling.<br /><br />3. Two all-powerful main characters = dull<br />Without giving anything away, I'll just say this: the power differential between main characters in a romance novel is part of what gives the story its enjoyable tension. If both characters are all-powerful godlikecreatures, then the tension comes down to one of them trying to convince the other one--mainly through the batting of eyelashes and some earnest pleading--not to use the aforementioned powers to wipe out everyone. And then even that tension is diminished when one realizes that the character doing the eyelash batting could just zap her own mental solution to the problem anyway.<br /><br />4. Villains torn right from the pages of a Batman comic book<br />Do you like villains in novels to twirl their moustaches, rub their palms together, hunch their hunchbacks, squint their eyes, and hiss, \\"Yessss, yesss, my evil plan is coming together--muhaha!\\" Then you'll enjoy the bad guys in Singh's novel, since they conform to the same villain schematics as do any of Batman's opponents. A bad guy who thinks killing off lots of innocent people is the way to win the hearts and minds of the ones he's killing off? Are we talking about Bane or Singh's villain? Bane actually has a more interesting backstory than any character in Singh's novel.<br /><br />5. Nothing exciting happens<br />There are plenty of moments in Singh's novel that are ripe for the kind of romantic tension that romance readers enjoy. The fact that the almost never generate that tension speaks to Singh's failure to imagine an interesting hero/heroine combination. The best part of the book is very early on, before Sahara really remembers who she is, when there's still some mystery to the interactions between these characters. After that, it's all downhill.<br /><br />I am a Singh fan. I've been very disappointed in most of her recent work. I think she ought to try to imagine a new world for her mind to play in. Neither Psy/Changeling nor Angel-land seem to be productive for her the way they used to be. But I have faith and I will keep coming back to read her again, hoping for the old magic to reappear...
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killer is a fast- paced read that is written in a simplistic style, but with tons of energy and intensity.  The premise of the book is awesome – complete with a thrilling plot that includes a serial killer, an ardent imagination, and hard-hitting dialogue.  The writer crafted his words to help build tension and intensity into the story which helped to support the expressive storyline.<br /><br />Max and Jesse were great characters that were very well-developed.  Todd Thiede did an excellent job with the dialogue.  This helped me get to know the characters – not just through descriptive language – but with personality and tone as well.<br /><br />Todd Thiede did a masterful job in putting this great book together.  If you like crime scenes, grisly murders, and top-notch detective work, this book is for you.  Highly recommended!
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I bought this for my wife, she likes it a lot. Case came in one piece as is not always the case for CD's.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Love love love this soundtrack. Cindy Lauper & Harvey Fierstein have created magic from this very special movie, and created the best musical of 2013.<br /><br />The soundtrack stands up well on its own. Great music and some very catchy hooks. Every song is well done and performed. Billy Porter is a stunning Lola...This needs to win best soundtrack Grammy and original score Tony.
B004U52VPS|1.0|I ordered this item, thought it would be fun to play with my wife as we are kids at heart. But when I opened it up, it was missing pieces so I had to return it.
B00C16NWUG|5.0|Price was not better as a gift set than buying the DVD and the CD as separate purchases. But still a nice package.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is a really fun game I really like creating cool makeup styles and it is just a really fun game
B00C4YZ12C|2.0|So I got this on the app of day day and I'm thinking it's gonna be an awesome game. No I was entertain for about 20 minutes and got board. The classic game glactiea ( I have no idea how to spell it) was much better. Try it if you must though but I don't recommend it. The reasons I didn't like it because of the down grading ranks over time and you got to powerful to fast an  if you didn't main tane it your screwed.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Whenever I put my kindle on standby or turn off. Or take Facebook out of the carousel it deletes itself and I have to 'download it again. It's annoying.
B00CNB31U0|5.0|Best series to come out of the UK in years (except perhaps Downtown Abbey) ... ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.. CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 5  ....
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|quite disappointing. lots of scenes shot in Budapest instead of Moscow. I find the collateral damage in this kind of movies too big.<br />where is this son coming from????
1569382603|2.0|I watched the video series via Youtube, and I loved to see the prehistoric monuments, and certainly there is great mystery in their individual creations, but Hancock doesn't seem to have a scientific bone in his body, and offers speculation built on speculation built on speculation built on looking what he wants to find - an desire to find evidence of advanced prehistoric advanced store-age culture during the period of the glacial melting 10000-12000 years ago. I'd like to trust his sincerity, with regular statements \\"I believe...\\", and spending thousands of dollars to explore an ancient momument site, he has a vested interest in \\"Accentuating the Positives\\" and relies on the possibility if he piles it deep enough, credulous believers won't notice his alternative prehistory case is a house of cards. So enjoy the view and gloss over what Hancock believes. Maybe someday better evidence will arise, and Hancock will be vindicated, but we'll have to wait.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Doesn't always start correctly on the kindle fire. Once going out works quite well. Levels are consistent through the game.
B0061S073A|5.0|Lets me allow my children to play on my Kindle Fire without any worries of them getting on the Internet or losing my place in my books, etc. The feature I like the best is the timer. There isn't any arguing when the app locks them out - time's up! Very useful app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game it's just that it takes forever to get the updates my sisters ipad is 0.7.1. And the kindle fire is 0.6.1
B005P4PAVK|5.0|There is nothing better to take your mind off of everyday stresses than a good dose of The Big Bang Theory! I can watch episodes numerous times and not get bored with them. I don't get the channel that this series air on, so I have to watch reruns on other channels. I found it was easier to wait and just buy the whole season!  Definitely worth the money.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|The author brings you under the illusionists power quickly and you find yourself accepting the implausible as commonplace. Great fun.
B00BTABOCS|5.0|I was raised a fan of Maiden, and I have been really loving them more and more as I get older. I have Live After Death, Donnington, and Rock in Rio. I always enjoy listening to them, and often make a playlist of them in Chronological order and listen to them all straight through (they are good enough I don't mind hearing a few songs 3 times in a row).<br /><br />I heard about the Maiden England tour and had resolved to move heaven and earth to travel to see it, because I had yet to see them live, but to my surprise they had Salt Lake City on the tour, the first stop here in over 20 years! So August 1 2012 I went to the show and was blown away by how good it was, and how great the set list was.<br /><br />So then I heard that this album was being remastered so since it is a good chance to get some Seventh Son songs live versions (among others) and relive the great concert I was lucky enough to see last year. Needless to say I really loved this album. This album, just like the other live ones, seems to have its own personality, and I had no problem adding it to my playlist and listening to Live after Death, this one, Donnington, and Rock in Rio. They are all unique and each is a time-capsule from it's respective era.<br /><br />The sound is really crisp, and it is probably my second favorite (Live after Death is still top dog) of the live albums that I have heard.<br /><br />The Price seemed a bit steep at nearly 20 bucks (been a long time since I paid that much for an album) but it is worth every penny.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm disappointed it didn't wrap things up but excited it will continue.  I hope we don't have to wait to long for the next book.  The wait for this book was killer! I'm looking forward to seeing how their story continues.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Finding Pride is the first book in a series about a small town where everyone knows everyone and even new folk are welcome to be part of the townsfolk.<br /><br />This is Megan and Todd's story. They have both been left heartbroken following deaths of their loved ones, both have had a rough time and when Todd first sets eyes on the broken and bruised Megan he vows to protect her and love her for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Megan since her father and husband have left her broken and not trusting any man who comes into her life, she battles with her feelings for the gorgeous man next door whom her deceased brother trusted more than any other person in his business and as his best friend.<br /><br />When danger threatens to come after Megan and try to kill her she has to overcome her fears and pull all her strength to defeat her demons and possibly for once try to have the happy life she has always longed for.<br /><br />This is an endearing and pleasant read. There are many characters in this book who have their own story to tell. Both Megan and Todd are likeable characters and I found myself caring for both wishing they would find happiness that they both deserved.<br /><br />This is a good start to a series, the writing style is non complicated and this makes the story an easy and quick read. I will definitely like to see more from this series and I hope Ms. Sanders develops the characters more through each book continuing their stories as the small town develops and reveals hidden depths.
B0002BO05S|5.0|i like this movie because of the character, all them are great encore entertainers.This movie is great for the holiday family moments.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book in this series didn't disappoint. Loved Reflected in You and I can't wait to see where Gideon and Eva's story will take us.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Am so enthralled with the 7 kingdoms and the development of all of the characters.<br />Will delightfully read on and on.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was time for it to end.The last few books have been leading up to the end result, therefore I was not disappointed. I found that I wasn't surprised at all. Thanks Charlaine Harris for all the years of entertainment.  Now I look forward to a new season of True Blood!!
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is very fun. It is better than the pc version I had as a kid. I would recommend to my friends.
B000SEI230|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  Wonderful story, teaching the rest of us just how we should live our lives.<br />If only that happened, what a wonderful world we would live in.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|Over-produced - nothing new these days - with Rod's voice largely buried in the max.  Rod: Get a band,get rid of the studio guys.  Best cut, COLD WATER, available on Target Bonus tracks only.  Love ya, Rod, keep trying.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I was a little surprised to find after the game was downloaded, that you had to be on Facebook. I don't use FB and prefer not to, so I uninstalled the game. It looked like it was going to be fun,sorry I missed it ...
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|It's always refreshing when a band mixes things up a bit for a new album instead of going by the numbers.  Dave & Co. have done just that with &#34;Super Collider&#34;.  No, this is not the Megadeth of the 1980's, everybody in the band is older and wiser and there are some signs of aging.  On the other hand, the boyz still know how to have some fun and that is on full display here.  The title track is catchy as hell and if rock radio still played new music, this would be in heavy rotation.  The production is top notch as well.  Just a great sounding album...plenty of low end which is killer in a decent car audio system.<br /><br />Kudos to Mustaine for keeping the spirit of metal alive & well in 2013.<br /><br />A must buy for any hard rock/metal head.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This book was a disappointment to read.  It was all over the place,  It took awhile to get into it and read it.  Not up to par with the other books Sophie Kinsella has written.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|As someone that doesn't like gore or you know...seeing organs outside of the  body...  I've been addicted to the show since I saw the first episode.  The graphic stuff isn't over the top or anything to the point where I feel like I should turn it off.  Not much of a review. Just wanted to leave it some positive feedback.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Best PDF reader I used. It can read almost every kind of PDF files. Majority of people use Adobe as their PDF reader.
0688101364|5.0|I re-ordered this book after losing mine in a move. There is such a variety of cookies to choose from.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is used by more and more churches these days. It makes looking up a verse simple. I like being able to still highlite and underline and this app saves all your notes too. I also have enjoyed a few 30-day daily devotions with friends and their are many to choose from... It will send you reminders if you fall behind. You can choose from many many translations and switch between them all too.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Friends of mine who are hikers, just loved this book.  I really enjoyed it but not quite as much as some other memoires I've read recently like The Glass Castle.  Interestingly enough, I found it very comforting to have a glimpse into what happened to Cheryl  after her hiking adventure.  It's always good to know when people land on their feet.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This book was action-packed and highly descriptive. Unfortunately I am not a video game enthusiast. I know practically nothing about gaming systems, their history, nor their strategies. This book was meant for someone younger than myself.
1439107955|4.0|Fascinating history of cancer and modern medicine for that matter. Writes in a style that is easy and enjoyable to read
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This battery app is very sleek ans very simple. The app tells you how much time you have left and what you been using your battery on. It tells you the exact apps you been using. Also it gives you tips how to save your battery. I love this battery app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game and if u like games that u get lost in and can't stop playing this is the game for its so much. So much fun:D
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does it again.  She spins a very good story.  Was able to figure out who done it pretty early but was still very enjoyable to read.  She never lets us down on a good murder mystery.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|This movie really does hit a point of diminishing returns.<br /><br />Its starts fairly promising, with a very clever plot and dialogue, and a great performance by Christoph Waltz (I can see why he won the Oscar!) But its a long movie and it gets tiring. Leonardo DiCaprio really seems to enjoy his diabolical turn (is there anything he can't do?) but it is just around his best part that the movie finally tanks into silliness. The blood soaked finale isn't shocking or artistic.<br /><br />Its boring. And the movie is too long. QT is pretty a darn good writer, but he needs an equally good editor. In the end time its not well wasted.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Great theme and story line. You got a sense of being of there and the thrill and stress these men faced while in time of War.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Different zombie movie. The music is greate. There very few movies that I would buy, I would consider purchasing this one.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|great app...very helpful in keeping up with the life of your battery. I had a different one at first but like this one better.
B00B5A9FLY|2.0|I was extremely disappointed with the ending of this series! We've watched it for 5yrs now expecting some spectacular ending not a sad one!! :0 Lousy writing on this one guys!
B00BI73CVI|1.0|When Russel Crowe started singing all the people in the room started laughing. stick to your day job Russ, More great action movies.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I LIKED when Aggie got a new puppy. I didn't like when Aggie lost his hearing aids.<br />It was great
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have to say this was the best trilogy I have ever read.  Mouth watering, intense, and mind boggling book.  U MUST READ IT!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I can't wait for catching fire. The books are always better, but the movie was great. All the hunger games cast<br />were fabulous. I hope the same crew plus will do the next movie.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes Sci-fi. It's action packed, humorous, and interesting. Never a dull moment.
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|I liked the Broadway play a lot better. The play was fantastic.<br />thte movie was okay. Slow start, drama in finding her love, now<br />the ending was beautiful.
0060245867|2.0|Unfortunately I had to return it.  The seller said it was in great condition but didn't say that the previous owner had written their name inside the front cover.  I was planning to give it to a grandchild as a gift and couldn't give them a book with some other persons name in it.
B000001FS6|5.0|After the monstrous success of The Joshua Tree U2 embarked on a massive tour, including many stops in the United States. In the process they continued to discover American roots music and this excitement was captured in the film Rattle and Hum, as well on the album. It is perhaps one of the most misunderstood collections in history and the backlash that the critics piled on this project left the band at a crossroads. We all know that the brilliant and game-changing Achtung Baby was the result but it's easy to overlook Rattle and Hum or to write it off completely. To do so is a major mistake.<br /><br />This record is so unique because it finds a balance between new studio cuts and live songs. While the record would probably have been better received as a strict studio album or live record, I love the interplay between these extremes. New songs like \\"Love Rescue Me\\", \\"Heartland\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"Angel of Harlem\\", and \\"All I Want Is You\\" are beautiful and firmly capture the vast expanse of the American landscape, both in terms of lyrics and music. The live cuts further demonstrate the band's energy when on stage, from the gospel choir version of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" to the passionate drive of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" and \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\". There's very little that doesn't jump out and keep you enthralled.<br /><br />Many felt that U2 were placing themselves on a pedestal with the greats, yet interviews with the band and much of the film footage show quite the opposite. They were excited about American music and wanted to pay tribute to it, a feat which I believe they accomplished. It's this push for growth that makes them such a vital force and keeps them relevant. They wanted to share that enthusiasm with us and the result is an overlooked project that demands serious reconsideration. It's the perfect companion on a long road trip and one of the band's most ambitious works to date. Give it a fair shot for what it is and chances are you'll become immersed in this beautiful journey through the American heartland too.become immersed in this beautiful journey through the American heartland too.
B007X0ZLLI|5.0|Yanni is a freaking genius!<br />I loved this album!<br /><br />I will definitely be getting more of this man's music in the future!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I feel like I'm playing on a jumbo size DS or gameboy. It is really cute and really fun! You should definitely get it
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Excellent album. Can listen through the whole thing (aka not a singles album). Fits right in with their other albums without being boring.
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked it, but then again I liked \\"50 shades of grey\\" and the \\"Anything he wants\\" books by Sara Fawkes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome try it you won't be disappointed u craft and mine have fun try some seeds and other apps will be awesome
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked the second novel by Sylvia Day even better than the first!<br />If you like her books, you might try Kyra  Davis.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|So many good songs, beautiful melodies, thoughtful lyrics.  I'm listening to it over and over in my car as I run my errands..makes for a happy day!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Installed, boots up, will let me write items but not create them.  Game is nonfunctional without that feature, hence the low rating.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I wouldn't pay for this app but I do like it and thankfully this one was free. I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate but if it is I really like it.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Since just watching season one, we couldn't wait and so had to get season 2. The series is so enjoyable and seeing all the little details makes it even better.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good fluff book. It is a fast read and hard to put down. Day writes well and  I will read anything else  that she puts out in this series. I liked that this one didn't give me anxiety reading it like the others had (which is a good thing).Gideon says \\"umm\\" a lot in this book which gets annoying,
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I decided to try this based on liking the colors of the battery itself,ended up liking how well it keeps track of my battery usage. Handy little app
6305903182|5.0|I just watched this movie in it's entirety and this would have been a great ending to the trilogy. Not too interested in seeing Scream 4.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love how kalinda and Alicia work together. Always a great turn at the last minute. Lots of lust and sexual tension.
B004P7CNUY|3.0|I bought this to complete my daughters' Halloween movie collection... she thought it was 'alright' and I thought it was pretty much on the same level as the other movies.
B0011ZVKVG|5.0|Welp, this is a good heavy metal album. Better lyrics than most other bands. Listening to this album I have grown to accept my problems with athletes foot more.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Great sandal, protects your toes and feet yet keeps your feet cool.  You can wade in them, ride a bicycle, hike in the mountains, its all good, can't say enough good things about them.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I loved the movie in the theatre and love it even more the more I watch it.  The casting is perfect, and in my opinion, Russell Crowe as Javert was an inspired choice.  Although he doesn't sing in the more operatic style like we are used to hearing with Les Mis, his smooth baritone I feel reflects the other side of Javert--the side that struggles with whether the world is really as black and white as he always believed, or is there is room in the world for mercy and forgiveness.  The rest of the cast was amazing as well, and the production was outstanding!
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|Great music reminds me of the old days....it was easy to download to my iPOD.  I really like being able to buy music this way.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Notice I didn't say &#34;I love it&#34;.  Don't want to say more that might spoil it for others.  Debra just needs to get over it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|best game ever if you like shooting stuff I'd recommend this game it's so fun get it know matter what.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|I read the book and thought it was awesome but I can't believe they allowed the movie to be made so badly. 99% of the book wasn't in the movie and the other 1% was totally a different story line. Big waste of time and money. Just read the books and forget this pitiful excuse of a movie. It is NOTHING like the book --so very disappointing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|in my opinion of this game is very much in the game creator's favor as i think that this game is very very good
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter loves this game and I enjoy it as well. I had a problem with fancy mode on my Kindle (I had to delete the game and reload it to get it to work again in regular mode); but fancy mode is working great on daughter's Kindle.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Loved the series. Romance and action all in one which made for a perfect movie! Didn't know completely what to expect and was surprised a few times by a few scenes in the movie which made it that much better.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Wow, what do I say...<br /><br />First of all, let me say that I love Gideon.  I have a soft spot for the alpha male type and Gideon is definitely a domineering, controlling, protective man.  The thing I love about men like Gideon is deep down they are big teddy bears just looking to be loved.  I also love Eva.  She is strong and intelligent.  I have always liked that she is just as damaged as Gideon.  She is not the weak innocent heroine that many similar novels have.  She brings just as much passion, lust, and desire to the relationship as Gideon.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching their story unfold after hearing that Nathan is no longer a concern.  Unfortunately, I felt that the storyline was slightly predictable.  As soon as the Mark and Steven's relationship took the turn it did it was obvious where Eva and Gideon would find themselves.  I thought Gideon's approach to the subject was sweet and romantic.  Swoon....<br /><br />The only negative I have for this novel was the ending.  I can't help but feel disappointed that the author decided to drag out Eva and Gideon's story over additional novels.  It makes me question her intent and leaves me slightly resentful.  To have waited months and months to final purchase this novel only to have it end as it did leaves me upset.  Perhaps I need some time to let it sink in, but right now I am debating whether I will invest more time and money to see the conclusion of the characters journey.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Another great book in the Crossfire series. Can't wait for the next! I wish men like Gideon Cross truly existed!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is super awesome and I love it  but I really would like to know how to get the update 7 1 I have built lots of cool houses I am a beginner I have only had this game for a few months other than that one question the game is awesome and you should get it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun and easy to play game. Extremely addicting, and I can't help, but play for hours. Runs very well on the kindle. Great game, worth a try.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The people complaining don't understand this series. This book ended on a day, just as the last two did. She didn't toss everything in the book because she wants to explore more with all the characters. Eva and Gideon have so much more to get over and let's all please remember this is all from Eva's perspective. We know she sometimes struggles with her feeling towards an old flame but we aren't in Gideon's head. We know he feels guilty over what has happened between him and Corinne but we don't know if he ever has the \\"what if moments\\" I'm so excited to read the next two and Sylvia has promised not to draw it out. If you enjoyed the first 2 books you will want more after this one!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I t think this game is cool but I wish you could interact with people and objects. And there needs to be more vehicles
B0063M22QO|5.0|love it and play it for hours at a time. I love the way it makes me think to<br />solve the puzzles.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I never watch TV and if I do, I knit or do other work to keep myself from being bored.  No knitting during Game of Thrones!!  Best thing I've seen in years--engaging, mesmerizing--nearly hypnotic!  I'm hooked!
B000W93CXQ|5.0|So good. One of the best books I've ever read. Sad, but totally worth the read. also very inspirational. Great overall
B001BR5NN0|5.0|My 21 year old daughter amazingly had never seen the movie so we had a father-daughter night in and watched it.  Every bit as good as I remembered with great performances and storytelling.  This was the first movie I remember as a kid that &#34;everyone was talking about&#34;, but wasn't some gradeose, bit scope story like Jaws or Rocky or Star Wars.<br /><br />Only disappointment was that the sound quality of the movie was not good.  Might have been my sound setup, but the audio was so low that I had to turn way up to hear the dialog. That was a shame because the ability to buy and stream to the Xbox is awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is very fun. this is a perfect game if you like building things or you are creative. enjoy it.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|I like Super Collider for the fact it has a diversity of sounds. Some leads and riffs are pretty good. I would expect more from a guitar duo of Mustaine/Broderick. To me I love the in your face fight anthem Built for War. Another stand out for me is the shedding light on the darkness song Beginning of Sorrow...poor Ward. That kind of s*** happens all the time. Off the Edge pretty much sums up society. I think for the most part Megadeth did a pretty good job. Not a Great job. I know I don't want to keep hearing the same record put out just with a different title. The lyrics aren't as deep as you would expect. But I have it now and I will have it in 20 years.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a pure awesome game, P.S the amazon page thing is out dated. Its wayy past 5.0 now. Theres new pets, slinky, ( Dog ) Persueus ( Cat )<br />A Pet spider, a pet dragon, a pet alien dog! Forgotten skylands, Atlantis, Moria, etc. Theres so many awesome things. Anyone who calls this a scam off of minecraft is too biased. This a beautiful, labor of love, not a copy of minecraft!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Great book - deep, richly interesting characters that interweave over time and circumstance. However, it seems the author just didn't know what to do with them. While the two main characters \\"close\\" in a longwinded predictable way, the others just seem to fade away, and I was curious about their finish because they were so interesting to get to know. Disappointed. Would have waited for the next draft had such a thing been possible!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ummm.... When is new update out my friends have it ,but there on ios so ,Anyways its a great app!!!<br />Worth buying
B00BF11STU|3.0|I don't know what all the hype was about.  It was OK but not riveting.  None of the characters were fully developed enough for me to love.  The people with the most spark, the Seals, were on the least amount of time.  OK for a rainy day.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|Will not even work on the kindle. Waste of time and space. I recommend buying<br /> another app that is better.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Loved the idea, but the plot was quite confusing.  Don't get me started on the make-up.  It ranged from good to horrible to almost frightening when trying to portray people of one race into another.  I rented it for free so the price was right.  All of those amazing actors just couldn't pull this together.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|the app is a wast of money a wast of space and a wast for time. DO NOT GET THIS STOOPED APP
B009UX2YAC|4.0|FANTASTIC GAME!!!!!!! i just wish it was a little easier to collect coins or the prices were lower it gets boring sometimes.
B002P79KAC|5.0|It is impossible not to laugh watching this sit com. Everything is scientifically explained. Enter the brilliant mind nerd world.<br />100% recommended .
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game.  Would give it 5 stars if it didn't freeze up so much & lag so often.  Would actually pay for the Elite account if they'd only fix those 2 things. Great way to kill time!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. The writing is excellent and the story is really good. I really enjoyed it. Thank you!!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Sound like Dirt which is the way that it should be and I might go as far as to see them in concert this time around since they seeming have gone back to the old formula and too bad Layne Staley's gone but it sounds fine.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am not normally a big Woody Allen fan, but this is a great movie.  For all those romantics and idealistic dreamers this movie just feeds the soul.  I never would have thought Owen Wilson could have pulled off such a charming role.  The characters that portrayed Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Scott Fitzgerald and the others were delightful.  This movie tickles your funny bone while at the same time makes you want to go live in Paris and pursue your dreams.  I love this movie.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Of the Nostradamus record that Rob Halford said that he was going to produce and release to the public, I read about this in a magazine article. We are waiting. Is this the same project or is there a separate entity in the making?<br /><br />AND I WAS VERY FORTUNEATE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SHOW WHEN THEY DID THE NOSTRADAMUS SHOW IN COSTA MESA CA BACK IN AUGUST OF 2011 AND I BELIEVE THAT IT<br />WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I HAD EVER SEEN THEM LIVE SO I AM STOKED TO SAY THE LEAST. THE LASERS AT THE END OF THE SHOW WERE FANTASTIC WHEN THEY DID<br />'RIDING ON THE WIND' AND THEY BROUGHT THE MOTORCYCLE OUT.<br /><br /> I STILL WISH I COULD GET WORD ON THAT PROJECT THAT ROB HALFORD SAID THAT HE WANTED TO DO WITH A 2 DISC DVD SET OF THE ENTIRE NOSTRADAMUS ALBUM ON DVD.<br /> BUT PERHAPS OF LACK OF INTEREST HE MIGHT HAVE DROPPED THE IDEA?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Hard to put down. I thought that I had known all of the Jobs stories through articles. This book is primarily in his words, without any of his editing. I will read again many times, and probably have my high school age son read over the summer.
B001JV5B12|5.0|What can I say. It's my kind of movie.  It almost walked out of here in the hands of a family member,<br />but I caught her and advised her to get her own!<br /><br />Dorothy R.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Going back as far as Billy Eckstine, the world of jazz has been blessed with a number of strong male baritone voices like Johnny Hartman, Kevin Mahogany, and others. Now we have one of the best, Gregory Porter. This album features a number of Mr. Porter's own compositions, works that are prematurely ready to join the galaxy of jazz standards, performed here with firm assurance by the singer and his first-rate accompanists. My introduction came with \\"Painted on Canvas,\\" cutting through the usual on cable jazz. After the third time I heard it, I was in front of the TV to catch this singer's name & immediately ordered it on amazon. The thrill of hearing that opening cut on a good system was surpassed by the experience of getting to know some of the other cuts which are quite complex and memorable. This album deserves many, many repeat playings.  Welcome to the great tradition, Mr. Porter.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Supposed to be a trilogy.... Scam to buy another book.... Author should be embarrassed.... Do not see the point of this at all
B008LG6SXS|4.0|I had excellent booking experience however a month later I was notified by my Visa card company that fraudulent charges were being attempted on my number.  Either one of the Irish hotels or booking.com had someone using my number.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Must see...eapecially if u like disney & fairytales. There r many different perspectives of the classic tales.  Great show & character development.
B001IF277K|5.0|came super fast and works great for xperia play i love it and would bye it again in the next two years and i also recommend to everyone else please buy this for your xperia play it so cheap and works great
B0010T0OCY|2.0|I am not given to much drink, so it is difficult to enjoy this movie. Its merely too dark. Yes.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|This book is brilliant as it can hit all of your emotions and can make you cry. It is also beautifully descriptive! Ten out of ten.
1416596097|1.0|This book is populated by the most unlikely and least sympathetic characters imaginable. By the end I was hoping that the lot of them would come to no good, and most of them did! Also, the relationships were most unlikely, if not impossible. Who could believe that a well educated woman, the German lawyer character, could form such a relationship with a low life like the Chechen character. The whole book did not pass the plausibility test.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I love this movie and wanted to test my home theatre system sounded great.  My daughter and I watch the movie every once in a while.
B0091WD4ZQ|3.0|If you're into action movies, this is not the movie for you. It's all dialog and slow at times, but overall it was okay.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Have not had the app on my kindle fire long enough to know much about it. The rate us box popped up and it was now or never. I give 3 stars at this point.
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King has many outlets for the work he produces.  If the latest project is one of his patented 600+ page behemoths that contains a supernatural element people want to call \\"horror\\" because it's the genre he's most commonly associated with, he's got his primary publisher, Scribner.  If it's a shorter work, novella length or so, he's published several of these with Amazon (UR and MILE 81 for example).  He's got a musical he wrote with John Mellencamp, THE GHOST BROTHERS OF DARKLAND COUNTY.  Marvel Comics publishes comic books with King's name attached to them.  Cemetery Dance produces limited editions of his works.  And his latest novel, JOYLAND, is published by Hard Case Crime.<br /><br />This is King's second novel with Hard Case Crime and at first I wasn't sure why he would choose to go the HCC route instead of the usual Scribner hardcover, when this book is certainly long enough (I'm still on the fence as to why his first Hard Case novel THE COLORADO KID was considered a \\"crime\\" novel at all when there was no real evidence a crime had even been committed), but having finished the novel, it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Yes, there is a supernatural element, but it's not THE story.  JOYLAND is a crime novel, plain and simple.<br /><br />The story takes place in North Carolina in 1973 when Devin Jones decides to spend his summer away from college working at a carnival several hundred miles away from his home in New Hampshire.  Located in Heaven's Bay, Joyland is a long-time attraction for tourists and locals alike, a summer hotspot that hires college students during the busy season.<br /><br />This particular summer, Devin is getting over having been dumped by his first love, Wendy, and not doing a great job of putting her out of his mind.  One of the few things he finds at Joyland that does seem to occupy his thoughts aside from Wendy is the Horror House, the park's infamous \\"dark ride\\" where, a few years earlier, a woman, Linda Gray, had been found murdered.<br /><br />Police had pictures of the killer, taken by Joyland's own \\"Hollywood Girls\\", those women who walk around the park taking pictures of visitors, then trying to get them to buy copies of the prints, but they were never able to find the killer.  And while the murder was brutal and grisly for sure, the thing that really gets Devin's attention isn't the murder, but the fact people claim the Horror House is now haunted.  Not everyone who goes in see Linda Gray's ghost, but enough have to give the ride a reputation and pique Devin's interest.<br /><br />The summer of 1973 turns out to be an important time for Devin not just because of his work at Joyland, not just because it was when he lost his first love, but also because of the lasting connections he makes with the people who come into his life thanks to Joyland and Heaven's Bay.  First there are Tom and Erin, two Joyland workers who share space in the boarding house where Devin is staying.  Tom and Erin remain lifelong friends with Devin, while another couple, the mother and son duo of Annie and Michael, while a part of Devin's life for a much shorter amount of time, become even more important to him.<br /><br />He meets Annie and Michael, the wheelchair-bound ten-year-old with muscular dystrophy, along the beach on his walks to and from work after Tom and Erin have gone back to school--Devin has decided to stay on and work through until the park closes for the year.  Devin's connection with Annie and Michael is immediate and seems to fill the holes left in him by Wendy, allowing him to finally begin the process of moving on.<br /><br />But all of this really seems secondary to Devin's true goal.<br /><br />He wants to see the ghost of Linda Gray.  And he wants to solve the mystery of who killed her.  And while King spends a lot of time on the relationships Devin builds with those around him, the heart of the novel, and Devin's motivation, is the mystery surrounding the murder.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel a lot more than I expected to.  After THE COLORADO KID and how much I thoroughly disliked that book, my hopes weren't high for this one, but King has certainly redeemed himself--at least in terms of his Hard Case Crime novels.  After this one, I'm more apt to be excited about another one.  JOYLAND is great in every way that THE COLORADO KID is not.  The writing is precise and energetic, it's got a rhythm and a beauty that feels like an evolution in terms of King's narrative skills.  The prose doesn't feel bloated, the descriptions--with one exception near the end of the book--don't feel gratuitous or overblown, and those typical King asides that, honestly, could and should have been edited out, are nowhere to be found.  Even at 283 pages of story, there's a brevity here not often seen in King's work.<br /><br />The plot was well-constructed, contained the requisite red herrings in a murder mystery, and the final reveal was well-done.  Of course, this could be because even King himself admits to not knowing who the killer was until he got to that part in the novel, and I think that always helps to keep a novel from being predictable, if even the author isn't sure what's going to happen next.<br /><br />The characters don't feel particularly original in a King novel (King's written enough precognitive children to start a basketball team and later in life Devin becomes a writer--shocker--which, I have to admit, felt overdone even before I started this book) but I think these aspects are handled well enough, and the writing itself is strong enough, they don't detract too much from the enjoyment.  Overall, I liked this book a lot more than I thought I might (I must have; I read it in 2 days).  That doesn't mean I'm ready for King to hang up his horror hat and write crime novels full time, of course.  I'm a horror junkie all the way.  But as long as his Hard Case Crime novels are this well-written, I'll gladly go along for the ride.  Joyland is aptly titled.vel a lot more than I expected to.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Could not stop watching once we started, had to watch the entire season. Can not wait for the next one.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Saw these guys on Conan this past week and was instantly hooked! They performed Safe and Sound and it reminded me of 80s dance/pop music. I went ahead and downloaded the MP3 and glad I did. Great electronic sounds, great vocals, great beats. You can't go wrong with this one. Well done Capital Cities! I'm a new fan.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It's truly an adventure, and the characters in the book become real.  It seemed I was inside the book, experiencing the journey myself.  I thought about the book when I wasn't reading it, and looked forward to when I could sit and read it. Immediately ordered Dragonfly in Amber when I finished Voyager (Outlander).
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|but the stories themselves were pretty cool - I wiki'd the original book and was able to get more info about particular characters I definitely loved
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider uses a bit of brain power, but it is also very relaxing.  I must admit that I am addicted to this game!  Highly recommend it for a simple little escape from reality for a bit each day.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good graphics, sound and quality of play time. There seems to be an fair amount of play time with the story line as I am only 5th level at this time. Can not wait to continue playing...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved these books. Gideon I put on a high standard. But it saddens me to say this book was not at all like the others. It just ended. Stopped. And I believe a off hanger even would have given you more information. I do love this story, love the urine BUT I AM EXTREMELY disappointed.... I will read the next book only hoping it gives Gideon and Eva the conclusion they deserve. What happen to this book???  Was it suppose to be longer and publishing decided we can make another book out of it? Because it literally just ended... boom. Done. I am sad.
0345525558|5.0|Loved the author's style of writing--flipping between the now and the past.<br />Enjoyed learning about the language of flowers.  The back glossary with the meaning of different flowers was very informative.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Maggie is always wonderful!  The youngster's acceptance and respect for her is lovely to see and his empathy for the ghosts speaks to his essential ethics
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|I wouldn't waste my money on this film. The acting was sub-par ----which I'm very disappointed abt because I was really looking forward to seeing Famke Janssen (from Nip/Tuck). The plot itself was riddled with holes: the beginning was relatively incomplete in explaining how \\"Hansel&Gretel\\" came to be. Positively, the special effects were pretty nice, as was the location in which the film was shot. If you have hours (and money) to kill, by all means, kill a few brain cells with this film. Otherwise, move on to something more fulfilling.
B0077PBPJ6|3.0|Purchased this for my granddaughter who loves Eddie Redmayne.  I did not expect as much sexual content based on the description on-line.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I am a huge Eagles fan and this was an interesting story to tell. Loved the interviews with current and former members.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is fun can be hard at time but it's fun hard. And the competition brings out the competitive side of everybody who plays it
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My favorite TV show of all time and I have been watching TV since the 1950's. The acting is perfect and the writing is so smart and funny. I wish I lived in a town like that. The characters are wonderfully written. I could go on and on but you catch my drift.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love the series<br />It's a great book if you read the previous books. Greg Heffley is a very funny character.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Not as exciting as his earlier books but more thought-provoking. As always, Le Carre give you new insight into the issues underlying the world as it is today. Worth a re-read.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This series sucked me in from the very first episode. While watching it, I forget about the cares of the day, and let it take me back to another place and time. A wonderful treat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing app! I reccomend this app for anyone who likes the PC version or the X Box 360 version. It's kind of expensive for an app but every penny is worth it....... But i do have a question when does the update for the kindle fire? Oh well i hope this helped u!  -Dr. Richtofen out  PEACE!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. I think the wedding addition is really cool. I wish the gems and bits were easier to earn though. and some of the ponies are so expensive! but I still like the game and you should too.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|I have listen to many songs that I have not heard in years, so I like their selection of songs. The only complaint I have is that they play the short versions of the songs. I do not see any really reason why they cannot play the extended version of the songs, since there are no commercials to go to.
B003L77GRO|5.0|SORRY HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET. BUT IF ITS ANY THING LIKE THE OTHER SEASONS, IT WILL BE GREAT. THE BESTI KNOW IT WILL BE.<br /><br />  DEXTER THE FITH SEASON
B008XKSW7M|4.0|A perfect mindless Chick Flick!  If your brain is sawdust by Friday night and all you want to do is curl up and watch a mindless but cute movie, this is the one!
B00A8307BG|5.0|The new offering by the guitar great is a modern reminder of why we loved Trower so much in the 70's.<br />The power of his talent lies in his subtle and slightly restrained playing rather than a loud center stage performance.<br />He crafts each song in a manner that satisfies yet leaves you craving just a little more.<br />The vocals on this album harken back to the strong and haunting singing on Bridge of Sighs and are the single component that I believe held back many of his other offering from garnering much favor.<br />This all resonates on this back to basics style of song choice and production.<br />If you like older Robin Trower, Eric Claptin, Joe Bonnamassa, Mark Knoffler and Hendrix you will be right at home with this release.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Steve Buscemi is genius in this. I love Michael Pitt. The historical quality and styling are right on. Watch the second season for more depth and drama.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Les Miserables is one of our favorite movies so we love being able to take this in the car or listen to the soundtrack whenever we like.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Professor Don Tillman is looking for a wife - but for some reason women don't warm to his unique outlook on life. On paper, he is every woman's dream - smart, good job, fit, organised - but he has always had trouble connecting with the opposite sex - as well as his own.  He decides to tackle his problem with his typically obsessive and analytic approach to life and embarks upon The Wife Project: a questionnaire design to rule out time wasters and focus on those attributes he deems essential to a good relationship.  But his quest for the perfect partner takes second place when he stumbles across quirky, disorganised, off-beat Rosie who is obsessed with her own personal project - to discover the real identity of her father.  Don summons his own unique talents and launches the Father Project to try to help this totally unsuitable woman who has stumbled into his life...<br /><br />Don is the most unlikely of heroes.  He clearly displays many of the attributes of Asperger's Syndrome but remains stubbornly ignorant of his own condition despite many obvious hints through the book and yet despite, or perhaps because of that - the reader finds themselves sucked into his world and even falling for him a little.  The book is face-paced, absorbing and when you put it down, despite the pat ending, leaves you with a content smile and that feel-good feeling inside.
B00006JSS8|4.0|I haven't heard some of these songs in ages.  Not to mention, I didn't realize how many Stevie Wonder songs I knew.  This is a great CD to listen to.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|If you are a fan of Downton Abby, this is a wonderful addition to your collection of Favorites.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Downton Abby yet, I suggest you watch Seasons one and two, and then purchase this season.  Anyone who enjoys British Period pieces will love this!
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Horror and mystery.  Great combo for this film.  You might want to hide your eyes every once in a while.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|All of the reviews are correct; it's just not my favorite movie. It has a good ending, but it's a long way to go to get to it.
B004G8Y0D0|4.0|Movie is a good as the original series.  The energy on screen among the actors was great casting.  Let's not forget the non-stop action scenes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's great and all but I heard that there is an update  but how do you update minecraft on the kindle? Can someone help? THANKS AND TRUST ME I WANT TO KNOW!!!!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|I liked how the movie unfolded and the potential possibilities of what is out in space.  What is in space and how many times have space travelers visited earth?  One never knows.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Books like this are a must for the public to really appreciate our armed service men and to see the situation objectively. We cannot count on mainstream media with its highly politicized postures and sound bite format to portray a picture that is helpful. In Chris' book you are able to appreciate the struggle and get a glimpse into the mind and constant dilemmas of the combat soldier trying to his best for this comrades and country. I found myself far more appreciative (than I already was) of not just special operations troops, but all our folks in uniform. Christ did a great job of showing the specialness of the SEALS but at the same time not making them into &#34;supermen.&#34; He did a great job really casting a complimentary light on all the branches of military, their courage and sacrifice. Finally, I picked up the book because I was interested in understanding the military sniper more. I wish that he had dealt with some more the craft itself, though he does to some degree. But the book does what it claims. It is his story and a very entertaining one. Chris' prose and tone is readable and funny. His untimely death is tragic. Prayers are with his family. Thanks for your sacrifice Chris.
B003L20IJM|5.0|Seeing the first film I was impressed as it was a great family film and the second film was just as captivating.
B000B589JI|5.0|This carries enough lighter fluid to fill my zippo I carry on me. The black piece you see in the picture holds an extra flint, and the zippo branded flat tag under that acts as a screwdriver so you can replace your flint. The only thing its missing now is some way to carry a wick. If you love zippos this is a must have.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This would help fix the world - even just around mine!!<br />Life is hard and this helps me with my emtional side.  Consider it, please.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the app, very convenient. It gives a lot of very helpful information that wouldn't be available to me otherwise.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I am a new amazon video user.  I was suprized at how easy it was to set up and view the movies on my Roku device.<br />The Life of Pi was beautifuly filmed and had a great story.  I would recommend this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw someone else playing this and became intrigued. It's challenging and addictive.  The early levels were easy enough to get me hooked. Some of the higher levels had me tearing my hair out. Good mental workout.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|There was no challenge to this.  I'm glad this game was free. I would have hated myself if I had paid for this.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I have a galaxy s 3 with moophie batterypack that lasts 10 to 12 hours and it said I had 1 hr and 30 min and 16 seconds left.  when the actual phone said I have 24 hrs left.  this app is a waste of time and space.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I never was able to get this to open.  Crashed every single time and after persistent and patient efforts, I deleted this without ever seeing what it was designed to do.  Disappointment.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I've been a long time pumpkins fan and while i haven't loved every single thing Billy Corgan has put out over the past 20 years, i really love this album.  During their last tour, they played the entire album and it sounded so great live.  I'm one of those rare fans left who appreciates Billy's creativity and the variety of what he has put out over the years.  I don't care if everything sounds like it did in the 90's. If it did, the music from the 90's wouldn't be so special, it would just be the same old thing, and then people would complain about that too. What i find is, most people can't be satisfied no matter what, but i try to look at the bright side of things. And again, this is a beautiful album.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|It is a great movie that the whole family can watch. It takes place back in the WWII era. This movie is a musical for the most part.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|THIS PRODUCT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS, IS ENTERTAINING FROM BOTH A VISUAL AND INTERACTIVE PERSPECTIVE.  MY GRANDSON LOVES PLAYING IT AS MUCH AS OTHER GAMES
B000007T1M|5.0|This is an awesome album, and the ordering and delivery from Amazon was quick and easy like always. I would definitely recommend this album to a friend.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|This is one of our family's favorite movies. We are a family of 7 and this is one of the rare movies that everyone likes. It brings back memories from my childhood. I must have seen it hundreds of times!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr potrays the character Tony Stark perfectly. This movie is fun and action packed, if you like RDJr then you'll love this movie.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I was so stoked to grab The Heist as soon as it released. Although the lyrical content is lighter fare and social satire at times (White Walls, Thrift Shop, Gold, etc.) he still adds to his catalogue of philosophically- and life purpose-driven writing (Ten Thousand Hours, Wings, A Wake, etc). I'm glad he included Wings and Make the Money (previous indie releases) so more people could be exposed to his meaningful, quality lyricism that sets him apart from the rest.
B002B0FLOM|4.0|bought this cd because of the country feel.<br />i have had &#34;harvest&#34;, for a long time, and it is awesome.  i was not disappointed with &#34;comes a time&#34;, neil young's incredible style, totally unique to him, is at it's best.  even better than i hoped for.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Love the thick 80s synth and sassy sister duets. T&S have grown leaps and bounds with more pop appeal, but still hanging onto their alternative edge.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|i am not really in  into but falling skies is a awesome show  cant wait to see new show on sunday
B003KVNV4S|5.0|I've listened to it dozens and dozens of times, but it's still compelling. Fine work, The National. Looking forward to more.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app for finding the current weather and weather forecasts.  I was able to input several locations, so now I know what weather my brother living in Australia and my dad living in Phoenix, AZ are experiencing each day as well.
B00CRW2066|4.0|High Violet is one of my favorite albums, so I've been excited to get my hands on Trouble Will Find Me. It does a fine job of delivering the quintessential emotive melodies over well-orchestrated alt rock we've all come to know and love from The National.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app..I love it. it is awesome. very fun games for all ages. wonderful wonderful wonderful great fantastic
B002QE3CTY|5.0|An amazing story. I am so wrapped up in the story I can't wait to start book two. I have to go get it now!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Sup everyone else is his first time in the world besides that lives of a random picture of pudding the kindle fire application of pudding to get the United States that I know who i am and everyone should be awesome
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love mahjong games. This one is fun that u can see the ones available. I've been trying to teach my grandchildren. This makes it much easier for them to see. I also like the various shapes. It adds variety
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I am not very experienced playing these games. I love the graphics, but I wish something would change visually one level to the next. Color, shapes, challenge. I also find that sometime there is a delay which eliminates important playing time. Once you have completed a number of levels the game (and not just this game) becomes boring.
B00170KA0C|4.0|This is a great movie with an unexpected ending. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but I will say it doesn't end the way you think it will.  And Julia Roberts is great...as usual.  :)
B00CJ32S74|5.0|If for no other reason, get this for the Florence and the Machine song (plus sign's broken, sorry). Unlike other soundtracks, this music runs the gauntlet from indie (XX) to mainstream rap (Kanye West) to dance (Nero). Definitely worth the money. But if you've seen the movie, you'll notice a few songs in it aren't included on the soundtrack- even the deluxe edition. So if you want the song where Nick and Tom party in his mistress' apartment (Jay Z \\"Who Gon Stop Me\\") you'll have to buy it separately.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire HD and it's the first thing I check every morning.  I used to turn on the Weather Channel on my TV every morning, but sometimes I don't feel like waiting for &#34;Weather on the 8s&#34; to find out today's weather! LOL.  This app gives me what I need quickly and briefly.  Thanks Weather Channel!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|What else needs to be said, TNG was, is, and always will be awesome. The restoration and visual effects are bloody amazing. Absolutely cool menu screen.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|This is my 2nd movie on Amazon rental and I love how easy it is to rent a movie! I'm probably going to rent the rest of the HP movies on here :)
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I knew it was a musical but didn't know all of it is sung. This was a disappointment to me. I would not recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I remember reading this book in high school but now as a college student I reread the book and enjoyed how easy it was to find it on Amazon for my Kindle. Definitely read it in less than 2 days and enjoyed reliving Ender's adventures.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. Wonderful acting by all. This movie brings to life the REAL experiences of slaves and how the British government was won to the side of abolitionists. I wish we had those kind of dedicated people in this country to move our government to change.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|After listening to the HP audio books, I decided to watch all the movies. Amazon rental was perfect because it gives me a 48 hour window to watch my rental. Love it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I LOVE EVERNOTE. IT DOES EVERYTHING I NEED. IT IS AN EXTENSION TO MY OWN BRAIN. IT CAN COPY WEB SITES AND RECORDS AND TAKES PICS. IT'S GREAT AND I USE EVERNOTE DAILY.
B00425S1H8|4.0|I plugged it in to a windows 7 computer and it was instantly recognized and in use today. Very transparent and exactly what I needed.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|I will always be a treky till the day I die. Nothing compares to the original STAR Trek. Firefly came very close in its short life.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am the rare one who has never seen True Blood, so I only know this series. It is sad for it to end, but there comes a time when everything must wrap up. I feel Harris did that with her final installment. I liked this book very much and am surprised at all the negative reviews. It gave me closure but it makes me imagine that Sookie is still out there living her life.  :)
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset works great, battery lasts, The mic and speakers have nice clarity. I would recomend this headset to any one.
193700788X|1.0|I feel like I ordered the wrong book. This was so below par --- and by that I mean in tone, continuity and especially character assassination. I don't feel that any character walked away better off than they were at the beginning of the series. The entire series could have been wrapped up in three books and I would have been a little miffed, maybe...but I wouldn't have been invested at the level that a THIRTEEN book series creates. Plus, I would've had a lot more spending money for things that have greater personal satisfaction....like shoes. I say read it...because you came this far in the series....but borrow it from the library so you can return it as soon as you're done. Then go buy yourself a sexy pair of heels.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Ai first I thought this was going to be one of those thriller-adventure movies that runs on pure adrenaline. However, there are some interesting issues that come up where ethical values are not black or white. And to have a black actor play the part of the main character who is at the center of these issues, takes it one step further as far as what's right and what's wrong. Although Denzel has played many interesting characters, not all of his movies are hits. This movie, however, really illustrates his tremendous talent as an actor as well as is a great story portrayed realistically as a movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|watch from the beginning, every episode.  Great sci-fi.<br />Love Tom and his sons.  Can't wait for season 3, writing and characters are top notch.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I never knew I could love a game so much! Not only is the quality ridiculously well done, but the tactic and mystery makes this game hard to put down. It makes you think and work with what  you have.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Wonderful remixes.  And with the sonic integrity of Sir George Martin!<br />The center channel and rear channels (if you have proper surround sound) makes for a massive stereo separation effect.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Unfortunately, I downloaded this to my Kindle HD but never had the oppurtunity to use it inasmuch as it really never worked.<br />Is it possible that the complete download was NOT completed.  I thought it would be a great ap to have;<br />sorry Amazon, it just didn't do anything.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have waited a LONG time for book 3 and like everyone else, I was left  hanging!! I even had to reread books one and two, wanting to be completely refreshed when book 3 was released only to be left hanging with another book or books to come out, therefore causing another LONG delay!  I cry FOUL!!! I have never written a book review but I am soooooo disappointed that I just had to way in!! Book 1 was good, Book 2 was great....Book 3, a disaster!  I am a perfectionist so not reading the next book is going to really mess with my &#34;closure&#34; personality but I am so mad, I am going to just pass!! What could have been BETTER than 50 Shades, clearly is NOT!!
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS IT ALL (caps emphasizing, not hollering)  Was removed from device/cloud entirely with the help of Luis, a tech I spoke with a half hour ago.  He assisted in selecting a new app
B005PK57IK|5.0|My wife and I have watched every episode from Series One, Two, and now we're into episode 14 of Series 3.<br />After this, there's Series 4 and then.........?  Withdrawal?<br />Great Show!!!!<br />Michael & Pat K.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this app I'm playing this all day long it's like a book that you can't stop reading but your in class so you have to stop reading it but anyway I love this game
B005GVW05Q|5.0|I was always mildly entertained and somewhat bored when hearing Adams' songs on the radio.  Seemed like the band you would hear when stumbling into a bar in Austin or in Manhattan on a weeknight.  But after I heard a few of the stunning singles from Ashes and Fire on WFUV, over and over, I broke down and bought the album.<br /><br />This is not loosy goosy alt-country with a few references to NYC streets and angst, steel guitar twanging in the background.<br /><br />This is a polished set of powerful, sensitive songs of haunting beauty.  One gets the sense of being in hands of a master--- dare I say?  Maybe that's why you see so many of the Greats collaborating with Ryan Adams.<br /><br />The key here is not only the presence of the legendary Glyn Johns, but the subtle, slightly jazzy piano groove laid down by Norah Jones on almost all of the songs.  It lends the kind of sophistication that Elton John's piano work always did to keep his most poppy of pop songs from sweating cheese.<br /><br />This album made me a believer.  It is the one that will be talked about 50 years from now.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Get this app it will help tell you your battery level and all you have to do is touch the app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I definitely would recommend this book to others.  But be prepared for very graphic descriptions of sexual encounters.  The second book is actually better than the first, but you have to read the first one to understand the second one.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Love this movie one of my top ten of all time. Tons of action. Can watch this movie over and over.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This game is really fun and I have no problems paying the 99&cent; for the upgrade. I think it's well worth it.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Not sure how it works because I didn't get a chance to use this yet. I'm sure  it  Will work fine.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I first played it on a pre-dos computer &amp; have had some version on every computer I have owned. This is one of the best. I am on my second trip through the games.
B00BOLE7X0|2.0|Guess I should have rented it in stead of purchasing it. Guess it would be a good time waster uh.
B00992CF6W|5.0|First, the game is awesome, usually the haters Don't know how to play. 2nd, the update will come! Just Be Patient because originally it was made 4 Apple and you have to wait 4 the moaning or team to format it. JUST BE PATIENT!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is a game if you are board or a fan of bakery story or club story this a game for you but there are better graphics
B0085YOD1A|5.0|LOVE that it shows how many hours, minutes you have left on battery. Definitely in my favorites folder.  Try it, you'll like it!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I usually only purchase movies that our family really loves and will watch over and over again. This is in the top 10. Cheerful and heart warming. This movie makes me happy. Everyone needs more happy.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An honor to call him a brother in arms. My deepest sympathy to his family and friends. Rest in peace brother.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|...is why I love this app. It says, out loud, that your battery has reached a certain level you set. I set mine at 50% and 25%, so my phone is never dead. It's not good to let your battery drain completely.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|its slow and freezes up your device and also has a lot of annoying pop up adds and my cousin loves it but she cant play it because it freezes
B0000X61VE|5.0|I've bought lots of home exercise videos over the years and I still go back to this one. I love the work out routine. Great video!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Holds up all by its self and brushes in bits and pieces of the original , in my opinion this is a really good remake of SAMs , and I totally can't edit for the fun all the evil dead fans are about to see in the future of this franchise . Watch after the credits ..!!!!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I was worried about ordering movies online because I heard of some problems with it, like the DVD being scratch or it being damaged. But I took the chance anyways and it was totally worth it! I placed my order on Wednesday night and in the same week I got it on Friday. I watched the movie and it was clear, bright, and the sound was perfect. I would definitely recommend buying from this seller (:
B008BDZP3K|4.0|One of his best ever albums with outstanding guitar work that was groudbreaking and never to be repeated as a start for his more orshestral era.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a nice figure out how to make it work puzzle. Much like cut the rope. It really didn't take me long to figure out a solution to all the levels. It would take a lot longer to figure out every solution to each level. It did seem to drain my battery a lot faster than similar games. But over all it was a nice game. Because of the battery drain I really wouldn't recommend it as far as waiting room type games.
B000OIZSVY|4.0|Once I built up some immunity against the author's relentless snobbery, I thoroughly enjoyed Eats, Shoots & Leaves. I've always been somewhat suspicious of the person who makes a habit of publicly shaming any individual unlucky enough to use poor grammar and punctuation in her presence - a habit she justifies with the rather transparent and eye-roll-inducing excuse, \\"I just love the English language too much to let the errors slide!\\" It seems there is always an ulterior motive at play: like Mom always said, \\"The bully who puts others down might just feel insecure about himself.\\" If Mom's words are true, this author has one major inferiority complex.<br /><br />But, although she is a bit of a curmudgeon (beware of the preface), she's quite funny; I found myself appreciating her sense of humor when it wasn't being used at the expense of the poor chap with bad punctuation. And it's true that we seem to have reached an all-time low when it comes to our knowledge of punctuation's proper usage. Who can disagree with her when she argues that it is in our best interest to refresh our memory for the sake of the clarity and style of our writing? There were definitely a few places where she clarified some usage rules for me.<br /><br />In addition to being an engaging and fascinating read for anyone who is interested in English, this book is an amazing resource for writing teachers. It's full of examples of what happens when punctuation goes bad, examples that my students actually enjoyed. (I'm not kidding; they even laughed out loud at a few!) Here's just a small sampling of what she offers the writing instructor in the way of helpful illustrations:<br /><br />After explaining some rules for the much-abused apostrophe, she writes:<br /><br />I apologise if you know all this, but the point is many, many people do not. Why else would they open a large play area for children, hang up a sign saying \\"Giant Kid's Playground\\", and then wonder why everyone stays away from it? (Answer: everyone is scared of the Giant Kid.) - page 41<br /><br />When discussing the comma, she writes:<br /><br />...readers grow so accustomed to the dwindling incidence of commas in public places that when signs go up saying \\"No dogs please\\", only one person in a thousand bothers to point out that actually, as a statement, \\"no dogs please\\" is an indefensible generalisation, since many dogs do please, as a matter of fact; they rather make a point of it. - page 81<br /><br />Another aspect of the book that I found really rewarding is her discussion of how punctuation influences style. It's true that much of her stylistic rules may seem rather arbitrary (for example, when she argues that dashes warmly welcome an aside while a pair parentheses treat the aside like more of an intruder). Even still, I found it interesting to think about how punctuation can subtly and not-so-subtly influence the tone and message of my writing. And pretty much of all of her arguments are persuasive, even if they are somewhat subjective.<br /><br />So, in closing, if you have a high tolerance for elitism and even a remote interest in writing, I heartily recommend this book. English teachers, especially, should get their hands on this one.: everyone is scared of the Giant Kid.) - page 41<br /><br />When discussing the comma, she writes:<br /><br />...readers grow so accustomed to the dwindling incidence of commas in public places that when signs go up saying \\"No dogs please\\", only one person in a thousand bothers to point out that actually, as a statement, \\"no dogs please\\" is an indefensible generalisation, since many dogs do please, as a matter of fact; they rather make a point of it. - page 81<br /><br />Another aspect of the book that I found really rewarding is her discussion of how punctuation influences style.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have no idea if I like it or not. I tried for days to get it to load and no luck....stupid game.
1451695195|5.0|Great book with many correlations to other people's experiences of the same kind.<br />Love the Blue Morpho symbolism. Tried to contact Dr. Alexander but to no avail.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This was an excellent investment of 20 dollars and 7+ hours.  High quality acting, great story line, can't wait for season 2 in 2014!!
B00C061I3K|4.0|Heavy mothra prog-rock rollerball disco. Heavy on the vocoder. Enough jangly guitar to make you forget the sappier slow ones. The Queen and David Bowie-like numbers are even lesser still. I'm glad they pointed out the genius of Giorgio Moroder. My wife hates this album and that's unfortunate cause I like her taste. However, I think she's wrong, but I also think maybe they should keep it on the dance floor: \\"We're up all night to get lucky.\\" The better longer ones have an effective repetitive drone to them; and the poppier sung ones sound like Steely Dan at their best: \\"Fragments of Time.\\" As the album progresses things get deeper. \\"Contact,\\" is mind-bending. Kraftwerk can suck on the autobahn.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I love Green Day, so I may be biased, but they never get old. The three new albums was quite an undertaking, and each one is a little different from the rest. Love them!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This story is so heartfelt and truthful!  You can really feel the characters loss, and heartache. An amazing journey to recovery.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|You would think the concept would get old, but it doesn't. The storylines are so good, and Michael C hall is perfect in this role. I look forward to season 8!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a solid book for awesome series. I can't wait to see the movie. Suck on that president Snow!
B008G59IBI|5.0|Of the three new albums Green Day put out this time, I like this one the best. The first and last song especially are really good, I believe the last song is from one of the Twilight movies. Enjoy!
B001XV09UG|2.0|This is not his best work by far. Perhaps if he had not cast then husband and wife Cruise and Kidman it would have been better.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It really quite shocking that this guy can guy any of them!  I have come up with some really bizarre and obscure ones - and he still guesses them!!  My challenge is to find one he doesn't get.  Well done!!
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I enjoyed the game a lot.<br />Great to keep me entertained while travelling.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I am really enjoying this!  It's nice to  window shop. I love  going to my &quot;P&quot;<br />I wish other people get the same enjoin net out of it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Saw this first in the theater and couldn't wait to own the dvd.  Am now able to watch more closely the scenes and enjoy some of the things that were happening in the total scene.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is cool and all but they need to add on to it with bikers redstone and much more<br />Also they have to add servers
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|i didnt have the highest hopes going into this movie, but it delivered. It took a tired zombie movie plot and breathed life into it. Fun to watch and all the characters are perfect. Great movie, I wish I bought the dvd instead of an online rental.
1422188612|5.0|Watkins' STARS Modal of five situations in which leadership occurs actually follows the Life Cycle of an organization. This is a brilliant contribution as it demonstrates that one size does not fit all in leadership. There are five situations to which leadership needs to be targeted. I've used his original book and found it delivers. It's great that he has updated it and there are many changes in leadership approaches since we've hit this century. His material on Turnarounds and Realignments in particular are exceptional.<br /><br />Alan Gordon
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Pretty good action and plot. I enjoyed the evolution on Tom Cruise as he ages. Another one to add to decent movie portfolio.
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|My 3 year old son loves playing this - he likes &#34;helping&#34; the fruit and veggies grow by digging, watering, harvesting, etc.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This latest installment was by far much more engrossing to me then the previous two books in the trilogy.  I feel like my questions were answered, finally.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app does exactly what is advertised. I love being told how much time I have left on my battery. Of course, it all depends on the different applications you are currently using.  FYI  I only originally downloaded this as a free app of the day..
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Life of Pi is a story of Pi Patel, the son of a zookeeper, who is the sole human survivor of a  violent shipwreck. We see his struggle for survival aboard a 26 foot boat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker who is initially a threat to Pi's life, but ultimately saves his life.<br /><br />This movie certainly did the book justice for me. A visual feast for the eyes, the film lives up to the imagery described in the novel. I did not see the movie when it came out in the theatres, but I can imagine how even more beautiful it must have been. It was as if someone took the color on my TV screen and turned it up to number 12.<br /><br />One such beautiful scene is when suddenly at night, Pi is surrounded by glowing jellyfish which light up the night; meanwhile, a whale rises and soars out from underneath the water. It is one of the most visually impressive scenes I have ever seen and Ang Lee's visual effects team is deserving of the Oscar.<br /><br />Many scenes I was looking forward to being in the movie were actually in the film. One is the scene where Pi writes his name on the board at the start of each class to best make his name memorable to his classmates and teachers. Also true to the novel, we also see the alternate ending Pi gives to the detectives.<br /><br />In terms of differences, while the movie is very close to the storyline novel, the book is much more in depth. The scenes with Pi's religious contemplation is much more involved as well as his survival on the boat. On the contrary, the scene when the boat is caught up in the storm and about to sink is actually more intense than that scene in the book itself.<br /><br />Another difference to note is that the movie is not as graphic as some scenes in the book. With scenes of some of the animals attacking and killing each other on the boat, as well as the \\"interesting\\" food choices Pi is forced to make trying to survive, I expected a little more gore...although I cannot say I am disappointed to be spared seeing such moments, especially since I watched it with my four year old son! I suppose in order to appeal to children and maintain a PG-13 rating, these graphic elements could not be included.<br /><br />My verdict is to see watch this movie! I would have enjoyed Lee's Life of Pi even more had I experienced the visual effects on the big screen. This is definitely an enjoyable film, even to those who adore the book.
6301247485|1.0|The visuals in this film were wonderful and lush. Redford's Gatsby was so flat and unemotional he could never have pulled off the tea scene where Gatsby bolts from the room then gathers himself up and returns. That's probably why they left it out. (see DiCaprio's version--perfection). So much dead time during scenes I wanted to shout 'just say something!' Mia Farrow seemed always on the verge of hysterics or tears. How exhausting to be married to her.<br />All Redford did was pose for the camera.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|when I bought this game there was no video. I thought it was like a free roam game. you know wreck havoc if you wanted or blow up buildings. plus those drones were from iron man 2
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|The movie is stellar - unforgettable images, great acting and a gripping story. But after I watched the movie I looked up several articles about Oskar Schindler and learned he first wanted to exploit the cheap Jewish labor and only later grew a conscience. Maybe I need to watch the movie again, but if this was touched upon it wasn't obvious. I would not have thought less of the man for this, and it would have given his character more depth.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books.This book is lacking a story line and filled space with meaningless sex scenes. So disappointed.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the customization options in this app. Very soothing, and has been a great aid in getting soundly to sleep in the past few weeks I've using it. Very highly recommended!
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|Unique and fun.  Seems to stay away from the conventional Viking themes.  I've enjoyed it a great deal.  Highly recommended.
0671027344|5.0|This is a really great book about high school life and just being a misfit.  Enjoyed it in HS and enjoyed seeing the movie and re-reading it later on.  =)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the trilogy.  I couldn't put the book down, As soon as I finished one, I ordered the next and started it.<br />This trilogy was not a typical romance, but a real honest book about two people finding love.  I mostly read James Patterson novels.  I stopped reading romance novels years ago, the story lines were all the same.  With Fifty Shades, the story was fresh, new and very modern.  I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the sexual content.  Very mature readers. The book is very explicit, so anyone who does not approve of explicit sexual content should not read it.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book brings alive every character and you become attached to each one.  It shows the evolvement of each person and especially Lin, who is the primary soul of the book.  You feel and care deeply for Prubaker.  Even when not reading it, you ponder each scenerio and discuss it within yourself.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love playing minecraft on my kindle fire . My friends were telling me 7.0 was out I as so excited. But they had Apple iPods. I can't play with them because it isn't updated yet!!!!!!

B008IJT0CE|4.0|Lots of choices for sound combinations. Easy to navigate. Has a custom timer you can set so it turns off when you want it to.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Pretty decent game....keeps you interested with the different tracks and let's you upgrade your car as you progress....Although the prices are a wee bit on the rich side. Overall I think you'll like this game :-)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved this book. However,I was expecting everything to wrap up. Now I have wait another year? I was under the impression that this was a trilogy.
B0090O07RS|5.0|an awesome documentary and concert, it was a gift for a family member and it turn out to be a great gift has an amazing resolution
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I really enjoyed hunger games.  I couldn't quite give it 5 stars because there was a few times I thought the movie probably could have been a little bit shorter, which is usually a sign that I wasn't as engrossed in the story line as I should have been, but overall the rest of it pulled me in and I was entertained.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|With all that's going on in these 2 people's life, how in the world is it going to ever end? I have really enjoyed these books, and cannot wait to see what's in store for the future. Please don't leave us hanging to long Sylvia. I had to reread the ending chapters of the first 2 books to remember what was going on. Do we know when we will be able to pre order the next??
1603427244|3.0|Pages are 5.5&#34;x7&#34;. a small format and even smaller pictures makes this an impractical reference book.  Directions for casting on and binding off methods are too sparse, leaving out steps and details.  This is an interesting book to tuck inside your project bag or airline carry on, but it is not a helpful how-to instructional manual.
B001R10BMS|5.0|It's no small secret that I have a thing for 'bad movies.'<br /><br />Yes, I'm aficionado of highbrow cinema like the later works of Pier Paolo Pasolini and the entire filmography of Japan's master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, but I have a huge soft spot for movies that other people would just call terrible, like pretty much anything from the Troma library and the hundreds, maybe thousands of the post-Leone &#34;Spaghetti Westerns&#34; which featured Italians pretending to be cowboys in movies made by people who had never even been to the area once known as 'the Old West,' let alone knew anything about what happened there, which is why those movies often featured cowboys fighting ninjas or something absurd like that. I digress.<br /><br />&#34;Never Say Never Again&#34; falls somewhere in between those two types of movies. On the one hand, it's a James Bond movie, you can't expect it to be very realistic or ground by rules like &#34;there's no such thing as lasers!&#34; However, it's not a movie that you would think is going to be super serious, it's not &#34;The Godfather,&#34; it's not about the politics of international espionage, it's, like I said-- a James Bond movie.<br /><br />From what I understand, this movie was produced by a guy who worked on &#34;Thunderball,&#34; a previous &#34;Bond&#34; film, he somehow obtained the rights to remake &#34;Thunderball&#34; and did so out of spite against Cubby Broccoli, whose production company, I believe it's called EON Films, has produced every &#34;official&#34; James Bond movie to date. Anyway, this vindictive producer got the rights and despite the movie being made solely with the intention of upsetting Cubby Broccoli, it's a fairly good movie. Sean Connery reprises his role as James Bond for the first time in twelve years and as he always was as Bond in the past, he remains darned good at it. The movie is directed by Irvin Kershner, who also directed hits like &#34;The Empire Strikes Back&#34; and a personal favorite of mine, the highly underrated &#34;RoboCop 2.&#34;<br /><br />The movie is, as stated, pretty much a rehash of &#34;Thunderball,&#34; however with an aging Bond who is no longer in his prime. He goes to a health center to get back in shape where he discovers a madman's plot to-- you know the rest. If you haven't seen it, it's not going to do any good for me to write out the entire plot. I will say, it's full of memorable scenes, the opening scene with Bond infiltrating a tropic stronghold was very memorable and kept me interested the rest of the movie, but my favorite scene had to be when James Bond plays a deadly video game against the maniacal Maximilian Largo, brilliant played by Klaus Maria Brandauer who I remember watching in Disney's &#34;White Fang&#34; as a kid.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fun movie and it's very much worth watching if you can find a copy of it!of mine, the highly underrated &#34;RoboCop 2.&#34;<br /><br />The movie is, as stated, pretty much a rehash of &#34;Thunderball,&#34; however with an aging Bond who is no longer in his prime.

B00ACP3OOM|2.0|October 25th. Plugged it in to recharge - dies on me. Also only a bunch of 50+ songs play. Sending it back yet again<br /><br />August 23rd. 2nd unit I got also just leaked water. Dead. Nice product but need to work out this issues<br /><br />Well it worked great 2x and is now totally dead. Return for replacement and will see how it works. Stay tuned.<br /><br />After returning some cheaper products i decided to buy the best. This one is awesome. Swam over an hour today - no issues.<br /><br />+Instructions very easy to follow.<br />+Product easy to use, even a MP3 rookie can get it working.<br />+Sound obvioulsy not concert quality but very good for purpose. I suggest weary ear plugs, which makes sould even better<br />-I could only drag about 6 songs at a time but concede I may not be doing it right<br /><br />It would be nice if it had a FM radio.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by a great AMERICAN! Chris Kyle was truly the best of the best. Godspeed Chris! Buy this book!
B0055UPG22|5.0|This is one of Pit's greatest, I love most of the songs and it was definitely worth paying for the whole album.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|Sorry, I am a lover of Police proceedurals but thought this to be very ordinary. Can't understand the fuss over it
B009JZSFUY|4.0|OK so not Kirk but ok.  I am not a fan of the new generation as much as the old group or the new kids that play the original crew.
B009POCG2C|5.0|This is a very watchable movie, just love Eastwood and Amy Adams and other stars.  The story is great, too!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This movie has everything that someone might desire out of a movie, great storytelling, action, amazing acting, great directing.  Truly a movie worth watching, the only downfall is the run time really.  Also like most Quentin Tarantino movies be prepared to feel some sort of uncomfort, but hey the guy is pretty truthful to the history of the time for the most part.  You really find yourself rooting for Jamie Foxx's character, and on the edge of your seat through most of the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|&#34;Rating this book was extremely difficult for me and I had to take some time before writing a review..<br />After reading book one and two and falling in love with Gideon and Eva, I counted down the days for their story to continue. Well, let me begin by saying how completely DISAPPOINTED I am!! I felt that this book was rushed.. The first two of the series flowed throughout chapters and their story thoroughly.. In book 3 I felt like I was missing half the story..there was nothing drawing me in like the others did.<br />And then... BAM... The book is OVER!!! With a little note from the author saying &#34;Dear Reader, you're right. This can't possibly be the end&#34; Seriously???? 6 months of waiting and the book end basically MID-CHAPTER???!!!!!???? Completely disappointed... I whole heatedly feel that the author could have continued and completed the series with the third and final book like we were originally promised.. I am seriously doubting that i will wait and read the forth (maybe fifth,if rumors are true) book of the series. I don't understand why she had to drag it out.. Why she would end the story mid chapter with out even so much as a big cliff hanger to draw in her readers into actually wanting to continue Gideon and Eva's story..<br /><br />Raising 3.5 only because of my previous love for these characters.. Very disappointed in this one...&#34;
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a cute and fun app by the makers of Cut The Rope.  The game is very clever and it gets challenging quickly.  There are often multiple ways to win a round, but also many ways to fail, so it takes some thought.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great way to keep up with battery life easy. Nice look of battery. Easy access to know when to power up device.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved it. It's hard to say much without giving away spoilers but the plot moved swiftly along and the characters were fantastic. I was worried that all of the buildup would lead me to be disappointed and I wasn't at all.  I loved both the heroine and the hero. I enjoyed how so much of their background was provided. So many questions were finally answered. This is either my favorite book in the series or it's tied w/Kiss of Snow and Caressed by Ice.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|loved \\"Heart of Obsidian\\" this is the best and all i would recommend that all of read this book.... Ms Singh has hit just the right notes and now i wonder who will be next in the series...need Aden and Vasic's stories next...pretty pls :-)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you like dystopian genre, you will love Wool Omnibus.  I was intrigued after reading other's reviews.  After opening the first edition, I was hooked.  I'm already reading the Shift series, which comes after Wool 1-5 and is a type of prequel to let you know how it all came about.  Hugh Howey, where have you been?  You're quite a writer!
0425252868|5.0|I purchased this book for a relative's 92nd birthday.  He was a bomber pilot who flew 30 missions over Germany during WWII (including this one)  and he said he enjoyed the book very much.  Nothing I can add to that except a big thank you to all the wonderful Americans who helped us win that war.  Their sacrifices should never be taken for granted.  I purchased another copy for myself.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I don't normally enjoy action films like this because I always feel like the story lines tend to be woven around glorified action sequences. This film, however, is amazing. It's not just given the &#34;action&#34; title for the sake of blowing stuff up; It's an actual thriller.<br />Liam Neeson went above and beyond in this role. It makes you never want anyone to mess with him. And while I'm not a parent myself, I can see how the premise of this film could potentially terrify a parent; No one wants their child taken hostage. God forbid my future children get taken hostage, but if that ever happens, I'd legitimately want someone like Liam Neeson to be there to get them back.<br />All of that being said, I highly recommend this film. I enjoyed it so much that I inevitably made everyone around me watch it for themselves. (They all enjoyed it. And I'm sure you will, too.)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|There are plenty of reviews here that give the potential reader the plot etc.  I just want to say this is one terrific book, beautifully written, of a family in crises.  The book presents many surprises, and demonstrates how a family can fool itself into believing they have the \\"perfect\\" family, who can withstand anything.  And, how important it is for a family to talk with each other, and take nothing for granted.  This is one of the best books I've read in years.
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|THe only reason this movie can exist is because of the title and the lead actor. Otherwise, it is pathetic production, awful directing, and sad acting.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Absolutely disgusting about the worst in people. Why in the world would Tom Hanks wast his time and talent on such garbage. He must have developed a low option of life.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is fantastic. Every little detail is a pleasure to experience. I'm looking forward to more games from this app developer, because I'll be buying every last one!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Let’s have a sober assessment of our gifts and not try to do things we’re not called or equipped to do – but let’s not go overboard and write off our potential in God’s service.
B00BEYYEE4|5.0|Great movie the cops are just like that in Boston, i liked the acting from Wahlberg damn good actor I've seen almost all his films.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well done.  Seems right on costumes for the period. Story lines are put together with the ability to make you want to keep watching.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Jack is great in this film saw it two or three times, and still enjoy it great acting from Jack Here's Johnny.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great Nice Apps Come In Handy For Reading Your E Book On Your Android Device Or Any Android Nice Apps
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|Saw this film years ago OK for a Eastwood someone else need not play him in a remake it wouldn't be the same without Clint.
B0038TWHP6|3.0|What you'd expect from this genre and movie release era, complete w a non value add random love story (time which could have been better spent in enriching the story) Nelson is always great, good supporting cast.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought G35, i really enjoyed it, till it broke like a year later. Looking for a good replacement at a local megastore for tech stuff, i decided to settle for AVATAR z100. Completely regretted it and decided to fork out the cash and get this. I have yet to find problems with it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Again this 3rd season didn't disappoint me either.  The writing is so amazing that you want to keep watching over and over and now with the DVD's I can!
B007KQI1NA|5.0|BU-353-S4 Weather-proof USB GPS Receiver worked better with Windows 8 and Streets and Trips than expected on a HP laptop. They are a great match up.<br />***<br />I have had a lot of people asking me about how the trip had gone since I used a HP Laptop with Windows 8, Microsoft's Streets and Trips. Well the drive there and driving (2,967 Miles) was though some of the worst storms that I have ever drove though, if I didn't have the BU-353-S4 Weather-proof USB GPS Receiver  connected to the HP Laptop most likely I would have got lost and still driving around in circles. I have to Thank the Amazon Reviews that I read most likely I wouldn't have known about how GREAT the BU-353-S4 Weather-proof USB GPS Receiver really worked out. The other Plus was that the wife never fell asleep during the trip, she made a GREAT Co-Pilot. Thanks Amazon for the hard work your people do in helping us out by sending everything we ordered in two days. Along with keeping the wife awake. :-)<br /><br />PS: I suggest to get a short piece of hose to protect the wire when you power up the window that the lead from getting damaged when you put it on top of your car or truck. The BU-353-S4 Weather-proof USB GPS Receiver has a magnet base btw!! It held tight during all the strong winds from the storms. Yes, I would suggest to anyone to purchase this this GPS Receiver.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just loved the 2nd season as well as the 1st. Can't wait for the 3rd season to start .  I heard several people also comment on how much they like it too!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Its a really fun game!! I love playing it! Its pretty hard at times but either way I really enjoy playing it.
1594484805|3.0|The biggest faulty example would be that the author compares Microsoft's encyclopedia to wikipedia. He claims that because the authors of Wikipedia were driven intrinsically, they put Microsoft's encyclopedia out of business. As we all know, wikipedia is filled with errors  and the reason people use it so much is that it's free. And as a result of lost in demand, microsoft's version of encyclopedia was put out of business. This doesn't compare quality of work. This example lays the core of the book, so i have trouble believing in it.<br /><br />It does , however, have a nice and handy dandy glossary and summary.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Its makes it easy to tell how my battery is while charging and I don't have to leave my app to go to settings (:
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited months until the release of this book, only to be left in a fury. And now to find out there are two more books in this story, is just plain betrayal to all readers. It seemed that Day is definitely out for the money and not the passion of writing. I thought this book was filled with pointless drama, and dreadful conversations. The focus of other characters lives, seemed irrelevant. This should had def been the end of this story. Why drag it out to the point of losing the readers interest?<br /><br />I, like the rest of the readers, will be in line for a refund!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. Make easier to know whats needed to make new products from factories. Lower monetary requirements for upgrades
B00AEBB97S|5.0|The movie was great I really enjoy having my own movie to be able to see it anytime I want to
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Visually stunning and mind bending. You need to look at everything and then look again.  Hours of fun mental challenges.<br /><br />I eagerly await the next room.
B000FA675C|5.0|Very intrigueing!! Made me want to go out and look for hidden codes!! Is it possible, is it real? These are questions you will ask?
0385343248|5.0|James Clavell based this sweeping novel on an Englishman (William Adams) who went to Japan in 1600 and wound up becoming a Samurai.  Other writers had already tackled this story premise.  But, it was Clavell who had the talent to put you smack in the middle of palace intrigue, cultural misunderstandings, ambition, lust, and the difficulties of staying in power.  In other words, this is a contemporary tale set in uncharted, almost incomprehensible medieval Japan.  This is quite a task for any writer; but, it was brilliantly executed by Clavell--a master story teller.  His use of conflict and suspense keeps you turning pages until the story ends after 1152 pages.  Ask yourself, could YOU do it?
B005MMY5RK|4.0|It was no doubt an excellent movie. I am not quite sure if I'd call it the best movie ever like everyone else. It had a somewhat depressing vibe to it. I thought the actors all did a great job.
B005K17RU0|5.0|After using so many web sites and other apps for weather,  I am amazed with this one.  It is now my one stop shop.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Works great and fun to play. Battles are fun, can play with or without really money with I like . Only down side with is wish I ha  more time to play and a few more workers
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie Sam Jackson was great as Stephen there was some humor as Panass.as<br />Panache by Stephen. Decaprio didn't take it seriously. Walz looked like he enjoyed his role.jamie was great, this was not a will smith<br />Movie.
B0000DC14V|5.0|Brando at his best!...not your everyday run-of-the-mill ride off into the sunset western. If you love old western movies,or westerns period,you will not be disappointed if you purchase this movie.
B00BESM14U|2.0|This is a coming of age movie which in reality does a decent job of addressing the subject of bullying.  For a PG-13 rating the language, drug, sexual content was a bit over the top.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When will 0.7.0 come out please respond mojang!!!!!!!!also very addictive and fun.add more items that are in pc so not people will buy
B009JBZH54|5.0|For the fans of the new batman movies is a great addition it has the trilogy and special features. The movies came in great condition and fast.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Clare Danes does a great job portraying Temple Grandin. Grandin has autism but that has not stopped her from revolutionizing the way stock animals are handled. There is a great quote that I suspect is authentic: &#34;Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.&#34;<br /><br />The director also did a great job of portraying Grandin's unique visual approach to the world.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|A collaboration by three masters in their area; Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins. A timeless story - a rewrite of Romeo and Juliet - with genre changing music and dancing. As a musician, I am in awe of how Bernstein demanded the most of his orchestra and singers. A few singers are not great but it does not detract. Still, the intonation when Maria and Anita sing in octaves in 'I Had A Love' is wonderful.
0316228540|5.0|It was a great read and different from her other books.  It is all about life in a small British community but could be anywhere in the United States.  I read it because it was a book club selection, but it was one of those books you couldn't put down.  The characters were vivid and I am sure other readers will recognize how similar the people in the small town were like people that you know in your church or neighborhood.  The book that I ordered was used but was in excellent condition and was shipped very quickly.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|LEGO Batman is a typical comic book hero type of animated movie.  Boys love it  and this is nice because it is all the super heroes.

B007SPPANM|5.0|Classic film.  We love it every time we watch it.  The sound track is wonderful on surround sound. The detail in the costuming and set are awesome.
1423489349|5.0|My young, 5-7 year old students lap this up. It starts out slow enough that they can play along with the cd on the first day. That gets their confidence up for &#34;playing with the band.&#34;  Many of the tunes are familiar folk songs and the made-up ones are also appealing. There is a certain amount of time spent commenting on the drawings... they're pretty goofy.<br />This is not the only beginner book I use but this, along with John Thompson's Teaching Little Fingers to Play, are my most often beginner books for learning to read notes on the staff.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|epic fail on galaxy note 2. Tried the free version spent the 5 bucks for the full version still no go.  Cannot capture a picture and convert it to a PDF. Contacted customer support 7 times (emails with zero replies) in 4 weeks wish I could get my money back but it's $5 down range.<br /><br />I have seen it function well on other phones but the new galaxys seem to not agree with this app....NOT FRICKIN HAPPY
1250006341|5.0|I originally took this out of the library and found myself renewing it too many times, plus putting so many postit notes for things to come back to, that I realized I'd better buy a copy. As an American, I knew very little about English history and watching the series made me aware of things I'd never considered before.  this book gives a great overview to the beginning of the 20th century not from a political standpoint but from a social one. It is a broad look at a multitude of aspects of life at that time. I can't recommend it highly enough. And the quality is top notch; the photos are the best.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|loved the lord of the rings.. this is part of the cherry on top...ending suggest another...watching for the second one
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Outstanding with many twists and turns to the plot.  With a surprising ending. One learns a lot of facts during the read
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is - by far - Fallen Tree's best effort!  The only problem is ..... it needs more levels!  I could play this game forever!  If you've played the previous two Quell's, you'll love this one even more!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|here's the thing, its an open world game on a plaform that never was able to create open world games ... it is a great game by all standards, however, once I get about level 20, the game gets the great idea to erase all my save data. just something to keep in mind while purchasing... could be fixed in a patch though

B000T433L0|2.0|Interesting to see a young Di Nero and Foster, but the movie moved along at a snail's pace even for a '76 film. The action at the end of the movie was pretty poorly done, parts of which made no sense. Not sure why anyone would give it such a favorable rating.
0425263924|3.0|The plot was: sex/ insight into every single thing Eva does on a daily basis/ sex/ that's it.<br />The reason that drove me to read this book as soon as it came out was that I remembered this story being a lot better than FSoG, but I kind of regret my decision now.<br /><br />It started with Eva's peculiar chest pain/ tightening at the sight of Gideon.<br /><br />I cannot believe Gideon killed the stepbrother from hell, I'm still thinking Eva's mom did it. Speaking of which; that weird, weird lady gives me the creeps with her stalker tendencies and whorish ways. But nothing compares to the creepiness of Gideon's sex drive, excessive amounts of cum and fetish for licking fingers with... Period no less. Eew<br />Their sex marathons were completely surreal and to add insult to injury Gideon becomes a multilingual out of this world super human being speaking Japanese, magically getting hard instantly, I don't even want to go on. Complete absurdity.<br /><br />So many loose ends. Cary and his f**** ups, Eva's mother and father and stepfather. Corinne and her cuckold husband, Megumi's disappearance, Mark's wedding, the reporter, Magdalene's HEA. Gideon's mom, and brother. The rock star.<br /><br />I mean, nothing substantial happened in this book except for the improvised wedding, which we should have gotten a lot more insight into in my opinion.<br />Oh, and, okay, what's up with Gideon is he bisexual or not? I was aghast while reading the airplane scene. Is he going to need that kind of stimulation to feel 100% satisfied? Can someone write fanfic of Gideon and another dude? Because honestly Eva is not that irresistible.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|The Toy Story series was a genius movie series.  You and your family can watch this movie over and over laughing every time.  Many very big stars voiced these characters.  And you meet a few new toys in this part of the adventure.  An all around great movie.

B00BEXB18M|5.0|If this album came out after rust in peace i'd understand all the hate reviews its garnering but its in the twilight of their career.Dave is more mature and wants to slow it down and experiment a little and still keep it megadeth and totally succeeds this time around.I love the new album.Great addition to their catalogue!

B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|After Earth was a decent Sci-fy. I loved the main message 'Take a Knee' take a moment , calm down and focus. This is a good Family 'Father-Son' movie.  I don't quite understand the 1-2 star ratings. This movie was much better some of the most recent SciFy's. Jaden and Will did a good job in their roles as Commander and trainee.  I loved this movie. It's worth a visit to the theater.
B005FFW46S|4.0|I don't know what some other people are talking about.  It isn't his very best work -- but what series writer does her best work after writing 20 books in a series?  It is a long way from being the first time that Pratchett has sent a character off to far off places, without the entire cast of characters along.  I found it a fine and worthy addition to the series (of which I have read every one).  Plot development, characters, etc. are all exactly what you would expect from a Discworld book.  My recommendation is: if you never heard of Discworld, go back and start with The Color of Money. If you are a regular reader in the series, this book is a must.
193700788X|5.0|Excellent condition. Great book. Good job. Not too pricey. Couldn't ask for a better deal. It didn't take too long to get here or anything, which was also nice.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is an easy game, but hard to put down.  It moves fast and  creates a lot of noise. Just wish I had  a faster eye for spotting the right gems for double  score.
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|This is exactley what I wanted to hear when I bought the cd last Thursday.  Its got a little bit of everything on it, I would not say country, maybe some hard blues, some good old fashion rock etc etc.  Very few artist are making this type of music and frankly, what has come out over the last ten - fifteen years or so from new bands is so bad and lame.  Tom Keifer has it down.  I saw Cinderella in San Antonio in 2012 and the entire band rocked.  I wish I would have seen Tom solo last month but could not make the show.  Anyways, this cd is very good and it is being played.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I wasn't to excited about this book...the story would have been better if she didn't so much time on the sex scenes
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I thought this movie was cute and scary at the right times. It was worth watching. I would watch it again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The alarm clock worked as advertised. I was cautious because I was worried that it would not be loud enough to wake us up. It is sufficiently loud, easy to set and does not overly drain the battery. I would recommend this product to others.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|5 star is what it should get! don't trust those negative reviews! but out of it all you will love this game &amp; play for hours = )
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is my favorite by far. My friend got the 0.7.1 update and it is so awesome.<br />There's water lava milk and regular buckets. There's realm playing. There's eggs AND CAKE!!!! I couldn't believe what I saw when there were spawned a in creative mode. It was rad. Highly recommend this app for kindle fire. No lag whatsoever. 5 stars :D
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game  has very good graphics. The animation  is excellent. The  hidden-object-mini puzzles were easier because the objects were not one big blob of whatchamacallits. This game did not make me dizzy or drunk from getting lost, interacting with the heroine, during her battle with an unseen evil. Sometimes it was scary, a bit, enough to keep me on my toes. The excellent animation made this a very enjoyable game.
1609613937|5.0|This simple solution saved my life. I had tried vegan but was missing two critical elements which were driven home to me by this book. What McDougall calls a starchivore, I now understand is a Low Fat, No Oil, Vegan.<br /><br />As much as I fought this, it is the only thing that has worked to stop my symptoms of coronary artery disease. And when I regress even a little by allowing the higher fat foods and oils into my vegan diet, I suffer the consequences.<br /><br />This diet is maintainable and sustainable. It satisfies. It is easy. It is inexpensive.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I liked this movie much better than the other Oscar winners. Very interesting and powerful movie. The actors are amazing.  The end seems a little bit exaggerated.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I really hate when people complain about how there is now good music left nowadays. The problem isn't the lack of good music; you're just listening to the wrong stuff. And this, my friends, is the right stuff. I've been a fan of QOTSA for a while now, so, in anticipation of a long awaited album--featuring Dave Grohl, Sir Elton John, and Trent Reznor, nonetheless--I pre-ordered it. It showed up right on time and I put it on immediately. And I was riveted. They have kept their strange sorta discordant sound, and still jam. My favorite song on the album is \\"Smooth Sailing.\\" I would strongly recommend this to any fan of QOTSA, or just grunge and rock in general. Exceptional work!
B0011Z330C|5.0|I can listen to this album every day and never tire of it. This album defines my childhood. Classic must have for every punk/rock fan.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|If you like sci-fi this is a good series to watch. Fringe sciences deals in all kind of &#34;weird stuff&#34; almost as if it were a realistic case of X-men come to life. It also helps a bit if you have a strong stomach.
B006NFKUF6|1.0|It was horrible on free version you play the first level and then if you want to contenue you have to purchase it
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's been a while so I thought I'd re-visit Star Trek. I forgot how much I love this show! And now that its been updated and I have a better tv set, the picture looks fantastic.
B002CNOA6S|4.0|I've seen this for the third time and still enjoyed every moment.  I would think this role would be very difficult to pull off but Hoffman is very convincing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an addictive and fun game.The graphics change every month with new challenges and character upgrades. It is a game for all ages.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|What can I say?  This movie was slow.  It pokes along like a snail.  If they cut everything out between the first ten minutes and the last you would understand the movie and save a lot of time.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I am a Ghost Whisperer fun.  I am very sad that there is not more seasons available.  I love the story.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Wow...absolutely fantastic drama and Denzel never ceases to impress!  Strong depiction of an alcoholic lifestyle and problems that come from not facing the facts.  Super movie!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It is a great free game and I love minecraft so I got it for free I love venturean!!!from YouTube!
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I liked the format. How it was written.  Learned  to handle people. Question and answer was a unique way of writing a story.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|SPOILER WARNINGS:<br /><br />Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman steal the television screen in BBC's &#34;Sherlock&#34;. Opening from the end of the first season, we find our unlikely heroes in a face-off against Jim Moriarty, a psychopath who's engagement of Sherlock is out of boredom more than anything. When he is distracted and leaves the boys be, it's a surprise. But before too long, we're off on a new adventure, this time with a member of the Royal Family being blackmailed by the intoxicating 'dominatrix', Irene Adler, and Sherlock's brother bringing him in to get the information away from her.<br /><br />The second episode again brings in a tale we all remember, the Hounds of Baskerville. This updated edition has the hound being the result of a hallucinegenic developed at the Baskerville military base. Interestingly, an assumption many fans of Sherlock had is all but confirmed by Watson and Lestrade, as they imply Sherlock has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism (which, coincidentally, is no longer recognized in the United States but is still recognized in other parts of the world). Many, including myself, thought this was the case and it was gratifying to see it make it into the show.<br /><br />Of course, the third episode is one we all wondered how they were going to handle, and I must say, they pulled it off masterfully. Martin Freeman delivers a remarkably emotional performance of a grieving Dr. Watson as he tries to move past his best friend's death (for we know Sherlock is his best friend, despite Sherlock wanting to say otherwise).<br /><br />Some people say Benedict Cumberpatch doesn't live up to the performance Robert Downey Jr. gave. I disagree. I think Benedict's variation combines not only to the nature of Downey's Sherlock, but the technological prowess of Downey's other big screen persona (though admittedly on a lesser scale).<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this season, and the first, and any seasons that follow, to my family and friends, and anyone who loves a good sarcastic remark. One remark that still sends me into laughter is &#34;I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath, Anderson! Do the research!&#34;
0765325950|5.0|This finally puts to bed a series that I have been reading for over twenty years and two authors.  If you have read the series - this brings it to completion.  If you have not, then you will be lost.  This series is way too complex to pick it up with the last book(maybe).
B007G92QGO|4.0|Had my interest from the start and kept it there to the end.  One of the more enjoyable reads I've had for a while
1250007208|5.0|I loved this book! I borrowed it from my cousin who raved about it. I loved the modern (future?) take on Cinderella. She is everything I love in a heroine, vulnerable, broken (literally), tough, genuine, and kind. I love her interactions with the prince and their romance is so sweet I was rooting for them the whole time. I was surprised by that fairytale twist ^^ I wasn't expecting that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really good game u get caught but then u get the hang of it and sometimes u unlock the toys on it and its for android iPad and ipod
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|this movie was awesome even though its now the fifth installment it makes no compromises on action or story line, its interesting as his kids are grown up now and we saw his daughter grown up in the last movie but yeah this dynamic is pretty new its definitely worth the watch i for sure wish i hadn't of listened to all the bad press and critics when it came out in theaters as they don't know what they are talking about, if your a fan you'll love it no matter what but truly it was awesome :)
0131103628|4.0|This is probably one of the most helpful C books I have come across. I recommend it for anyone learning C or wanting to get better at it
B002LVUKJ2|5.0|I selected the slowest delivery option but the product was delivered very, very quickly. All five games come on one double sided disk.<br /><br />I installed all the games on Win 7, they all run great and provide me hours of fun. Having played the games earlier it is more fun because I get to compare how I am playing now vs. how I played years earlier.<br /><br />If you love the Commandos series, this is the collection for you. And it comes at a great price.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I found this app very useful. I create edits on Tumblr, and this is perfect! Definitely worth the 5.00 spent. I've had this for a while now, and have never experienced any bugs or mess ups. Highly recommended.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The best English Drama I have ever seen on TV. I really hope they continue with this series, I have never seen so many people hooked, my English family and friends and Americans alike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great for passing time. I personally think it's better than temple run.... but that's just me. As I said it is a very much enjoyable experience to play
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Really well written and engaging this book tells a tale that will be interesting to anyone.  It will also open your eyes to the mind boggling distances that ultra runners - or nutcases as they are also known - can cover.  Amazing!<br /><br />For a runner it does a bit more.  The author explores and challenges some long held beliefs about the &#34;right&#34; way to run.  At worst it will be a good read - at best it could really make you think about how and why you run.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The more you play this game, the more addictive it becomes. I would like to see a little change in the way it is scored, but I do love the game. Wish more people would play it.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie was wonderful. I always love the feel that Christopher Nolan adds to his movies, but this movie did a wonderful job at capturing Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. I also especially loved the hallucinogenic scenes. Very well done!!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Ok, I don't mean to be all negative here, but lets face it...if you've played one Fruit Ninja you've pretty much played them all.<br /><br />It's got good graphics, lots of unlockables, and the Fun Fruit Facts are actually kind of interesting. But in the end, it's still just Fruit Ninja.<br /><br />Good game but nothing new. Get it if you've been living in a cave and haven't tried any of the previous FN apps, otherwise don't clutter up memory space.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is different but I love the creativity that went into making it. It was worth the little money that I paid for it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I'm sure that by now other reviewers have been raving about the graphics and gameplay of PM, and they aren't wrong, so I won't even waste your time with more of the same.<br /><br />All I will say is.....GET THIS NOW WHILE ITS FREE!!!!! What a deal! It's rare that you can pick up a quality game like this for a song.<br /><br />If you're into Mario-style platformers this is the game you've been looking for, don't wait!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always been a Mahjong fan, so this was a great game for me. Simple to use and easy to navigate. I love it!
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|We liked knocked up and were expecting something along those lines. This was not funny and actually kind of depressing.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|This was an excellent children's movie. Even though I'm not a child, I loved it all the same. It made me laugh and captured my attention the whole way.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|After reading this book I felt more comfortable in my own skin. It reminded me that the desire to stay home and read a book is a perfectly valid and healthy way to spend a weekend, and the fact I like to perform as well is not a contradiction, but just another facet of my personality.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone of any age!  You will definitely not be disappointed with this one!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the reviews ahead of time so i knew that people were angry and disappointed that this wasnt the last book.  So I was a little nervous about how this book was going to turn out.  Im relieved to say that the book was wonderful!  Eva and Gideons story needed more and this was it!  I know its going to be a long wait for the next one...but ill be one of the first in line to buy it when it comes out.  I love this story and i love all the characters!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is just a simple fun way to play and pass idle time!<br />This can be fun for all ages!
B004SIP8BG|5.0|This film is visually stunning & the choreography is amazing!  There IS nothing else to say, except for... Just buy it!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond dash is great fun for all ages!  The adults like the relaxation of no real skill needed the children learn to pay attention.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I HATE THIS GAME sorry I messed up the title I am a girl but I hate girlie stuff. I only like bugs animals and learning about minerals I also like minecraft also my name is Isabella and I am 7
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is one of the very best apps I've even played. It's like a jigsaw puzzle using your brain and the smartly planned out clues. It will have your mind twisting up and down as you play this perfectly designed app.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A very different and unique read, at least from my perspective.  Highly interesting and informative and I suspect the crux is close to the truth as far as young, and vulnerable Wunderkinds.  Not being a highly intelligent and enlightened right ended bell curv type.  i could not readily identify with the protaganist and even some of the very human and competitive (green eyed beasts) antagonists, but I really enjoyed the strory line and reality of game playing that military defense uses to enhance expertise in military ofensive and defensive tactics and strategies and most import to develop and build the killer instinct to win.  I did see or was able to relate the characteristics of Captain Kirk's early devlopment from the Star Trek series where James T. Kirk won his game by ignoring the limiting so called fair play and good sportsmanship tenents of society and won by doing whatever was needed to overcome a game stacked against him.  Ender did it on a regular basis just to survive and ultimately triumph.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|What's better to play by yourself or with a friend? Yup! You may play with friends. I love this game so much and can connect with my friends over the summer.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was that there are only four colors. But, I bought the full version so I got more. It is strongly recommended.
B006Y5H74W|3.0|This show had so much promise, but it got buried in a soapy plot with too many extraneous characters. Not a surprise that it got canceled after the 2nd season; they just couldn't make up their mind what they wanted the show to be. Too bad, as the music and dance performances were fun. Even with the persistent problems, I found Smash a fun watch. It's just hard not to think of what could have been.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|I love this movie people can learn a lot of things from it. This can really happen in our life time.
B000W1W9EW|5.0|Nick Drake was a tortured soul but sometimes it seems the most beautiful works come from angst. This album's greatness lies in the simplicity: Nick Drake and a guitar (and a tad of piano). Saturday mornings with some coffee and this CD make me feel so relaxed. \\"From the Morning\\" is probably my favorite, but that can vary as well. The entire CD is only about 28 minutes, probably the most melancholy 28 minutes ever recorded.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE minecraft pe!!!! It's the best app I've bought in my life :) worth every cent that you pay acutely l think a little more!!! GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)))))) :)))))))))
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great read by sparks,per usual! A page turner that doesn't disappoint. Hope to see a movie made soon.<br />Makes stimulating discussion!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The characters are still great, as is the writing. This however is 1/4 of a book. I get books written in a series, but each book should have it's own subplot within a larger plot. This just introduced new conflicts, but didn't wrap up any old ones. Perhaps the Sylvia Day has too many projects in the fire and this is as far as she could get when the publishing time came due. I'll read reviews of the next book before I purchase. So disappointing...
B001AXNGNO|5.0|Every song on this album sells itself. Set aside Erotomania, every song on this album had radio potential. Long enough for progressive fans short enough and catchy enough for casual rock fans. A perfect blend of mainstream and technical musicianship. Well worth the buy.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|The fact that I don't have much to say about this other than that it is excellent is PROOF that I'm spending more time playing it than writing reviews about it. 'Nuff said!
B00499NHLC|5.0|This modern adaptation is clever and engaging. All the characters are delightful. I really enjoyed the references to original stories all while making new cases.
0670014893|4.0|from a long-time fan:<br /><br />subtlety is no longer a prime quality to be found in le Carre's works.  He seems to be sensing that his time is running out, he has things to say, and he wants to sure he gets his point across to even the most dimwitted observer.  I cannot remember a le Carre character more cardboard than the American miss maisie, or one more reminiscent of the winner of Monty Python's Upper Class Twit of the Year Competition than Kit Probyn.  okay he's not a complete loser, but unbelievably stupid and naïve.  And once again, le Carre launches a version of the \\"innocents abroad\\" concept we saw in Our Kind of Traitor, that Helen MacInness was so fond of.<br /><br />So the book has its faults.  But let not the few rotting limbs obscure the view of the forest or the many grand redwoods therein.  The prose itself is, in so many cases, spellbinding.  The kind that makes you wish you wrote that way.  The descriptions of place are cinematic.  True, the occasional political stemwinder interrupts one's gaze.  But Le Carre's true target here is not America, or even the \\"war on terrorism,\\" it is the war on liberty.  His description of the hole of state-shrouded secrecy into which a perceived miscreant can be tossed is Kafka a century on.  His description of the state-private enterprise quasi-military security alliance shows a system that maintains the veneer of freedom above an increasingly fascist reality.<br /><br />I was thinking that Le Carre's books have recently depended too much on exposition and backstory and less on unfolding action, and this one is no exception, but then I remembered that even Smiley's investigations proceeded much the same way, and certainly A Perfect Spy was almost entirely rendered in that fashion.  And that book, while too long, has perhaps the highest quantity of unforgettable passages of any of Le Carre's novel.  And here, as in Our Kind of Traitor, once the exposition is done, the plot snowballs downhill with increasing momentum, the kind that forbids you to put the book down until you have reached the end.  And that end is remarkably like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, imo.<br /><br />world weariness, cynicism, bitterness, convictions of betrayal, moral ambivalence and equivalence used to be the attributes of his characters.  now they belong mainly to the author.<br /><br />still, for no other author do I go to my local bookstore to buy his newest work on the day it comes out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND DECEIT. GOOD READ. ENTIRE SERIES IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME! WILL SHARE WITH EVERYONE I KNOW WHO LIKES TO READ!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow treatment of the super-vigilante story aptly balances adult perspective with no compromise action. Characters are developed in depth and supported by an excellent level of acting. Finally the story arcs are well distilled through the episode so as the viewer looks forward to the next episode, not only for a fresh story of crime fighting, but also for the pleasure to discover how the characters will navigate their relationships and deal with their past.<br /><br />This show is some of the best thing that ever happened to television.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND DECEIT. GOOD READ. ENTIRE SERIES IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME! WILL SHARE WITH EVERYONE I KNOW WHO LIKES TO READ!
B009HNDSL4|5.0|This is such a well written and inventive show, with characters that far surpass what they could be, on paper, with other execution.  It's got physical, intelligent, and WFT humor in a single show. Seriiously -- in any other writers', directors', and actors' hands, characters like Jay and Gloria, Mitch and Cam, and the rest, would be cardboard and offensive.  In Modern Family, they are totally sympathetic and very, very funny.
B003O86FMW|5.0|UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND DECEIT. GOOD READ. ENTIRE SERIES IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE TIME! WILL SHARE WITH EVERYONE I KNOW WHO LIKES TO READ!
B00COMLLX2|4.0|It is still a new game for me, and I haven't had time to play as much with it as I'd like, but the graphics are neat.  I am still having trouble going from screen to screen....but I'll hopefully get the hang of it soon.  I think this game would be easier on the computer!<br />I had an old pinball game on the computer in the 80's and almost wore it OUT, and was devastated that they never made another one.....What is the matter with all these software companies that they don't realize that Pinball is a GREAT computer game?
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|GREAT! LOVE WATCHING THEM BACK TO BACK! GET TO FOLLOW ALL THE BACK STORIES OF THE CHARACTERS. RERUNS JUST AREN'T THE SAME!
193700788X|4.0|This book started out slow, but got better quite quickly.  I enjoyed reading the middle of the book, but I felt that ending was rushed to get it done.  I think she tied everything and everyone together to end it and satisfy all curiosities, but I'm sad this is the last of this series.  I do feel that the ending she chose is not one I would have picked.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|love it its so fun sometimes a little boggy wish it didn't ask to share on facebook automatically the extra menus that try to pop up slow down the game
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is really fun but how do you update it on a kindle but its still really fun!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!:D:D
B001ANYDAO|3.0|the book is interesting to a point  however it is easy to dispute some of his theories  he looks at one side and does not  delve further
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Best small tool kit ever. I haven't found a screw or job around the house that this tool can't fix. Of course it is only for small fixing jobs not big ones. If you're into electronics the is a must-have in your desk.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|All my kids enjoy this game. We see who can achieve the best score. My youngest found game and now my oldest is playing it day and night.
1595825045|5.0|First off, I just wanted to let you know that I am a character designer with an emphasis on Animation. So, my reviews will basically be based off from a Character Designer stand point, and a huge fan of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series.<br />This book will not disappoint you, as an artist. Not as a character designer, but as a concept artist, environment artist, story board artist, etc. If you are interested in working in the animation industry, this book is a great reference point on figuring out how the production process was in creating this awesome series. This book is a keeper for any artist. Highly recommend this book for artists to learn out of it.<br />If you're not an artist but just a huge fan of the show, you won't be disappointed either. You get to read about the backstories on how the characters were created. Why the animals were hybrid, or even how the creator's thought up the story!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Man, this book was so good! What a page turner!!! I loved the characters, and the sudden turns in the story! I loved everything about the trilogy. Suzanne Collins is a great author!
1781162646|5.0|Best Stephen King in recent years. A newer style. As a babyboomer, I enjoyed the flashback to the 1970s. Book is funny, a mystery, interesting characters, and great descriptive details. Happy to read a different kind of King genre.<br />Enjoy the read!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This bird crazy game requires minimal skill, however it can can quickly  draw you in and make you eggdicted to it!
B00BC24NT4|1.0|A truly unsatisfying book and a monumental waste of time. What should have been an intriguing story dissolved into nonsense. What has happened to le Carre?
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased it for a birthday present for my child's friend.<br />He has one elder sister, so they can play with it together.<br />(My children has more easier one.)
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|This movie has the depth of a puddle. So since they destroyed the entire world in Revelation and such, they decide that it all actually didn't happen, and it was all just a giant simulator, which makes no sense at all because...*sigh* I am not even going to get worked up over this.<br /><br />The plot is so simple, predictable, and flat that you feel like you are watching a cheesy video game rather than an actual movie.<br /><br />Worth watching? For free, that's about it.
B002L5GFTM|5.0|...For general excellence.<br /><br />What can I say? This is a great family film with a spiritual message. There's no sex in it at all, so you don't have to worry about that. Kids can learn all about culture- music, black people, and painting, like Picasso. It's a good film about moral values. Just two brothers on a mission from God.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It was easy to install and I am enjoying it. There isn't much more I can say. Give it a try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great best horse game I ever played also I love the comp. and the activities you can do and all the different types. of hores
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I chose this inflatable pool because out of the several I looked at this one had the best customer reviews. They were right. This is a very nice pool for the price. It was easy and fast to inflate and has lasted through weekends of play including a birthday party with 6 other kids playing in it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I would not mind paying for an &#34;without the ads&#34; version, then it would be great<br />Thank you very much
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I am super in love with this game! I just got it and I can't stop playing! I highly recommend it to someone who is looking for something free and fun to play. :)
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock and Watson make a great team. I certainly found it worth the time.  Looking forward to the next season.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book! It was easy for me to like and care about many of the characters. There were several dramatic revelations that had me on the edge of my seat with suspense and the need to know more. There's also the fact that this book contains several scorching moments that are pretty much guaranteed to have many readers fanning flushed faces with gusto! I've already purchased the second book in the series and plan to start reading it immediately after I finish this review! Sylvia Day is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors in this genre!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's free you have nothing to lose just try it, you won't be sorry.  Fun, addicting, challenging, what more could you want.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I had never heard of Halestorm before watching the Golden God Awards. But they absolutely stole the show with their performance! I immediately bought both of their CD's from Amazon and to me, it's some of the best pure rock and roll I've heard in a while.<br /><br />Here you won't find anything fancy, experimental, or revolutionary. It's straight up, in your face ROCK. And that is a great thing. Everything on this album is produced perfectly and exemplifies the nature and FEELING of what rock should be.<br /><br />I hadn't heard of them before, but now I consider myself a fan. Lizzy's vocals are dead on and the drums.......oh the drums! As an older rock dude I appreciate Halestorm. Long may they rock!
B000069CWE|5.0|Just added to my collection. I recommend it for any Linkin Park fan. Arrived quickly and on time. You can download the music while you wait for your shipment to arrive.
B0010SEMP0|1.0|I found both the of the main characters to be obnoxious and poor rip offs of other well know characters(except without the charm of those characters). One thing that happens a lot in all of these books(I read 2.5 before finally giving up) is that the frequently kill other characters in the book for doing things that they themselves do..so they are extremely hypocritical.<br /><br />All in all I could not find much at all to like about this book. I recommend any of Patricia Brigg or Ilona Andrews books...I have read them all and easily gave every one of them 5 stars..they don't disappoint.  J.R. Wards Dark Brotherhood books are also good and I enjoyed many of Sherilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books as well.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I only post books that I rate very high but this is truly the best book that I ever read .... and I am probably averaging 100 books per year.  Oddly, her other books are ok to good but this one just hits me right in the gut.  It is so visual and pure.  Having read it over a week ago, I still am reliving some of the paragraphs in such a fun loving positive way.  I suspect being a guy influences my love for this book versus her other books.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a good little app. It is easy use and not a memory hog. Get it and use it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Doesn't always follow the book but its very accurate. Movie is very good on its own I would recommend this movie.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Waiting two hrs to heal really? Its kinda pointless and aggravating u grind and grind then when u need them uve gotta wait
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|This film is a historical reference which illustrates President Lincoln's path to abolishing slavery.  I liked the stories the President used as analogies to get his point across which was portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis immaculately.  You do have to pay attention because you can miss out on something if you get distracted.  I believe it's a very good film and I understand why Daniel Day-Lewis was rewarded the honors he achieved from this role.  I believe historians/history buffs will enjoy this film completely.
1452101248|5.0|I love cookbooks and have found Ottolenghi to be totally amazing. Sharing this book has been a pleasure. Cooking with it very satisfying .
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|I realize why Mel Gibson won honors and accolades with this film.  Excellent depiction on how our Lord and Saviour died for our sins and transgressions.  The film was extremely graphic but point definitely get across.  Nothing negative about this film,  I think it exceeds expectations and I believe many christians will enjoy this film.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett rules! If you are a Follett fan, you know what to expect. he grabs you and won't let go
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've ever read! Can't wait to read the next two books! You must read it!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a very engaging game with great visual graphics that appeal to everyone. The puzzles gradually get harder making it hard to put down.
B000GCFO08|5.0|This movie is scary scary scary.  A must watch for those nights you want to cuddle close and chow on a bowl of popcorn.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a tender, touching book.  So scary that these sorts of situations actually happened.  But it's part of our American history and I'm grateful, to learn about it.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|This has it all, action, adventure, romance.  While it is cheesy at times, for the most part, it is a pretty good movie.
B000H305U0|2.0|I saw Justin on television recently and he was tewrrific. I bought several of his C.D.'s to play in my car as I drive. Sadly, the music was not pleasing and seemed like alot of noise. I think Justin performs better in person than on a C.D. I ended up giving the C.D.'s  to a teenager I know. The teen likes noise and rap music.
B00094ARZ0|4.0|So rediculous, such bad acting, but fun as heck to watch, and of course all the eye candy for both sexes is always a plus.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Sorry to say, this C.D. was hard to listen to. It was alot of noise and not pleasing lyrics. I saw Justin on television, so bought this C.D.  I think it is better when you have a visual of his performance.
B000J103PC|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  Streep and Hathaway's scenes together are the best, just wish there were more of that dynamo in the movie.
B009NP6ID6|3.0|The Hummer vehicle chase scene, at the end of the film, has been cut out of the movie.  Raw and uncut?! I think not.  Very Disappointing.  The movie's ending suffered at the loss of this scene.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but all my freinds have 0.7.0 and I cant wait for the update so update plea&szlig;ssssssssss ok
B005LCECU6|5.0|if your a Rush fan as hardcore as I am you will love it. it shows how developed they already were and how John Rutsey ( the original drummer before Peart) could have never hung with the other two. (Diabetes issue aside) It also shows the development process of later songs after they were refined. great!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|What she does works, it's that simple. She had variety, creativity, and the music is catchy. Can't stop listening.  Highly recommended.  Also check out her other stuff on YouTube,  she cosplays and does ballet in her music videos
B00377V6J2|5.0|As a big SRV fan it was refreshing to see him playing rythm  as Albert plays the leads.  Very  nice relaxed session! l loved it!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|These Mahjong games are fun, but not so easy. Very challenging. Only wish the tiles could be a little bigger.  Playing Mahjong keeps the mind sharp.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The best season yet!  Finale had me on the edge of my seat!  This series never fails to impress.  Can't wait to watch season 5.  Huge fan.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Played through the &#34;tournament&#34;. Had fun with the pigs - not violent, just fun.Good game for children for hand/eye  coordination.
0425263924|1.0|The book was so disappointing.  I returned entwined and will not be buying the last two books. I fell in love with Eva and Gideon. They deserved a happy ending. Entwined was all sex and no plot.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Don't get addicted and it is free. Play once a day or once a week as it kills a little time when nothing else works without wifi or you don't want to think. (lost this game with a broken Kindle)  Update Jan 2116: Started playing again on new Kindle a while back and got about 60 levels in with 1 or 2 star bonus on all prizes and the game just came up with level 1 and all progress gone. I will not restart since it is too broken to trust it with my effort.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|Altered State is easily one of the best albums of 2013.  Tesseracts new singer is excellent, and the band continues to write passionate and interesting songs.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a simpler game than some of the others.  grandson likes it a lot. it  takes a little practice to get really good at it,  but<br />it is a fun game.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Delivery was as scheduled and quick.  The product is perfect for my needs as I travel extensively, far and wide.  It's great for watching movies on the plane as much as it's great for reading in bed.  It feels and IS sturdy and I love the look of it... simple.  I definitely recommend it!
B001ILFUD2|5.0|This is a favorite movie for my daughter and I. The story and music are wonderful. The dogs and cat have lively personalities and you really connect with all the characters in the film.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I waited to Friday to start season three because I didn’t want to be distracted by things like work. They stayed true to the storyline and pulled it off. Walter was in rare forum. If you don’t like needles this season might be a little too much for you.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved how the movie brought the book to life for me. I really enjoyed seeing the characters in the flesh and not just in my mind's eye.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movies is a little too language-ey for my tastes (includes the F-word). Still, I give it 5 stars because it had a great theme that didn't come across too preachy or cheesey, well, maybe a little cheesy. Guys, this is a zombie movie you can get your wife to watch with you. Ladies, think of it as a chic flick with something that is ACTUALLY interesting to your guy besides the fact that he's watching it with you. Some reviewers have said it moves a little slow, and that's true, still I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I enjoyed the wide range of options available to customize the sound I wanted.  I wish there was an easy way to save it as a favorite.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Didn't care for it in the beginning but it grew on me and I really liked the later episodes...<br />Guess it takes a bit of time to get used to the British humor...
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I've never tried Space Monkeys but I know that this game is loads funnier. In this version you need the abilities that come with new levels.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I cannot begin to express how delighted i am with this Dvd collection. I'm so happy to have all the extras and the blue ray quality to watch this great series on. I can even put these on my ipod now since I have the digital copies :)
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really liked this book it was fun to read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to hike and be in the wilderness. It gave me the incentive to try to hike my canyon.
B007N85POS|5.0|My kids love anything angry birds and since this was free on the kindle inbought it for them. Great app no complaints
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was different than I imagined but I really did like it. I would recommend it to any one.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Its an okay app.  It basically tells me the same thing my kindle tells me without pressing so many buttons. Not worth  99 cent but i got for free app of the day so no harm done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a really good and engaging bingo game.  The different countries and games keep you interested.  The quest to complete collections is addictive.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Charlaine Harris had written a book, where I as a reader, get closure. True to Sookies down to earth upbringing, she chooses herself and her own happiness in the end. The choises are not easy, but she does it whith an almost quiet dignity. I will miss Sookie, but is ok with the series ending
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|According to rave reviews this story is beautiful and uniquely human.  In fact, everything a person does is human, dontcha know, and I don't understand the need to attach \\"beautiful\\" to every story of personal hardship and tragedy.  We seem to be the culture that needs to experience *everything* vicariously, but The Sessions isn't much of an experience.  I didn't like it, didn't hate it, but I'm sure I should have felt something and I didn't do that either.<br /><br />Part of the problem, I think, is that this movie shows us way too much.  The sex scenes come off as clinical, because they are-- both in the sense that they're a \\"treatment\\" for the main character and in that they're about as interesting for the viewer as a medical brochure.  Tab A goes here and so on.  Why not less of that and more insight into Mark?  I think that's what the priest character was for, but then, he's distracting because his opinions make no sense for a man of the church.  Mark asks him outright if he should have sex outside of marriage, and the priest replies that, due to Mark's condition, he thinks God would understand.  That might by what your average layperson would say, but I'm pretty sure the official line of Christianity is you don't break major rules just because you feel like it.  If there was such a priest in the real Mark's life (can't find a yes or no) then I take back everything I said.  If not, the character's just plain out of place.<br /><br />Even though we all do it, watching someone try to get laid doesn't scream \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" because whether a person is getting sex is usually only really important to that person.  When I think about it, I'd have been much more interested in a movie about how Mark got that degree he was seen receiving at the beginning, since college is a real achievement whether you can breathe on your own or not.  (And what are the logistics of that?  How do you type with your mouth fast enough to take notes?  Can he see the board?  etc.) I know a person who can't have sex is going to think about it a lot, maybe even feel incomplete for not having it, but at the end the movie literally measures Mark's worth in the number of beautiful women he's been able to attract.  We don't even see anything of his life with the woman who stays with him.<br /><br />I suppose for people out there who didn't know disabled people can have sex lives, this may have been a real eye opener.  Maybe it would appeal more to someone who does watch a lot of movies about people trying to get laid, and has now decided to include a disabled person's quest for diversity's sake.  And maybe this movie really inspired some people.  That's nice.  But to me it just felt like an underdeveloped story that wasn't entirely film-worthy in the first place.  At least its boldness stands out against sappy \\"cancer road-trip\\" movies and the like, but it still is kind of \\"so okay it's average\\".
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Yes this was the typical Arnold movie. Gave it 3 stars for the action but hard to see him as the kick A$% type of person anymore. The story line is ok .  Put it this way if you have nothing else to watch that when it would be worth watching this movie.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Just when you think you know what's going to happen you find out you're not even close. Now I know after reading Best Kept Secret that there has to be a new book in the making. I just wish it could be completed faster. Does amazon know when Jeffrey Archer has the next cliff hanger coming out? I hope I don't have to wait too long!
B005SHTXN0|4.0|Great characters and believable acting. The portrayal of autism is done respectfully and while it might be misunderstood by some characters, eventually it brings everyone together.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|so worth purchasing. Daughter does not disappoint. This album tugs at my heartstrings and soothes my soul. check it out.
1616202416|5.0|Memorable, believable characters are just one reason to love this novel. The other is Adichie's writing which transcends race, culture and tradition. The author is a natural story teller and her world becomes yours as you find yourself utterly absorbed in this fine first novel.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a awsome game till the end of the game<br />I love this game<br />I rate this game 5 star
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I think this book is a sweet romance. I recommend this book for people that like romance that believable and not dripping with sex.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm not sure where to start. It really does seem like either the author was bored and pumped this out just to get it out or perhaps doesn't manage her time well and procrastinated up to the point where the publishing house said \\"get it done now\\". It just seemed like she didn't care very much about this book. I knew right away that it was my least favorite book of the three. I'm glad I read it but I did return it for a refund citing 'quality issue' for the reason. I don't like feeling like I'm being taken advantage of and that is how I feel. Will I read the next one if there is one? Probably, but I'll return it just as quickly if the quality is the same as this one. I'm very happy to have that option.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|This game looks fun but save your money every time I try to open it up it takes me to the Catalans sometimes it just says internal problem or something
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Our first impression of anything or anyone that we come across is not always right. We should sometimes step<br />back and take a harder look, consider the circumstances and then pass judgement. Malcolm Gladwell is a great<br />researcher and writer and Blink is a good insight into our fast and first impressions.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great, great great read. Until the end. I'm left wondering if Gillian Flynn suddenly became bored with her writing project and decided to wrap it up, real quick like. The entire book deserves five stars... Until the final few chapters: Which deserve none. Utterly anti climatic.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It won't let me update it to Miami and Im getting passed off and I wish they would fix it pretty please.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Josh Whedon crafted an interesting adventure story that seems to be a combination of old-style western and a space opera. It has interesting spread of characters with excellent character development along the way. Even after missing the &#34;Serenity&#34; movie (a synopsis of the entire season), I really miss the chance for more stories.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Good movie, full of action Sean Penn and Josh Brolin were great a must see if you are into the whole Mafioso underground world
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Not seen this movie for a while sought of remembered the ending but still found it very entertaining. One of my favorites.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first got this game, I wasn't very good at it but now I have a high score in the three millions because it is so addicting. I was able to get all of the versions. Everyone should play this game!P.S. When my friend came over, we switched devices. She played this awesome game and I tried to get her three ducks on where`s my water on her I pod touch.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|The sequel to the Yossi and Jagger storyline meets all expectations I had. It portrayed the struggle of an individual unable to come to term with his loss and thereby leading a miserable life. A chance encounter with someone makes him aware of what he had been missing, allowing him to to embrace life and love and live in the moment
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed reading all three, great books. Even though it did consist of a lot of sex, which did giver ideas to use in my bedroom
B008220BLG|5.0|Never came near enough to our town. A fun love story, had a wee bit of cursing, some violence (well, zombies eat people, so it's to be expected).
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I will admit that I am not reasonable about this book.  I have read a crazy number of books in my life, but no book has merited as many re-reads as \\"Dune.\\"  It is brilliant, profound, provacative, and the type of reading experience that is all too rare: one where you want to know more about every detail that the author mentions, even in passing.  This is such a rich world that no review can possibly do it justice, but the world-building is so complete, and so deep, that it almost seems bizarre that this is not an alternative future.  Simply amazing.  Oh, and don't give up during those first 70 pages - Herbert throws you into the middle of the story without any warning, but it all makes sense.  trust me.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I am enjoying &#34;Golden&#34; as I enjoy Lady Antebellum's past offerings!  I encourage any of their fans to buy this latest recording!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Slow start and then everything started to fall into place. This is a great plot and Follett worked it all together.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wasn't really sure about getting this boom but am really glad I did!  Thoroughly enjoyed it and intend to get the next one!!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I personally own all the others in the series and consider the one before this to be the best of the series. This one on the other hand is all action, no story. Mind you, I'm all for the action flick, I enjoy a mindless action film. This one doesn't even attempt to build a story, just goes from one action scene to another. This is minor attempts at character building, and I mean minor. Further, a pet peeve of mine is when scenes from the trailer aren't actually in the movie. The scene where he says \\"We aren't a hugging family\\" is in there, but in the trailer Willis says damn straight, in the movie he says \\" You got that right\\". I know minor, but still don't put scenes in the trailers if they aren't in the movie.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has penned his first hard crime novel in Joyland, the tale of a serial killer in a amusement park. College student Devin Jones takes a job at a amusement park one summer. It will be a summer he won't forget as he recovers from a broken heart, learns what life is like as a \\"carny\\" and tries to solve a murder.<br /><br />I'm a big mystery reader. I have a whole bookcase dedicated to the greats and the more recent releases. So when I heard Stephen King was writing a mystery I was intrigued. I have loved everything King has written and I was really interested in seeing if he could pull off a mystery, without it turning into a horror \\"slash-em\\" novel. Well let me reassure die hard King fans - he can!!<br /><br />For me Joyland was more than just a murder mystery. It was a cold case murder mystery combined with a coming-of-age story that was possibly the sweetest coming-of-age story I've ever read. Well if you take away the creepy-serial killer-at-a-amusement-park thing!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story from Devin's point of view. He is young, in love, and later nurses a broken heart. His year at Joyland was the year that he grew up and learnt so much, and this comes across so clearly in both King's writing and Michael Kelly's narration. It's a story of heartbreak, sorrow and death. It was a story that I am so glad I read, and one I will never forget.<br /><br />Joyland is a intriguing mystery and a coming-of-age story all rolled into one. I highly recommend it to both King fans and mystery fans alike. Michael Kelly's narration was fantastic, as he tells of the highs and lows of the summer.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed the relationships in this book. No major upsets. I am so disappointed in the abrupt ending that came from no where...
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love all flow games. I love all the puzzles . I wonder what flow will be next. Hope it will awesome
B005LHOKFS|4.0|The Trip Advisor is fun and easy to use.  It gives me easy access to travel information.  We use it to check out hotels and activities in the areas we plan to visit.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Like the game idea but it gets a little boring sometimes. Maybe add a feature to make it more interesting.
B00AQ30IRG|5.0|Plot/Scripting perfect; better than the original by light years.<br /><br /> Acting, particularly Ferrell's dramatic (even his over-the-top trademark  moments) believable;verbal and non-verbal, body language,everything.<br /> All other actors, extraordinary! Especially their fight gymnastics.<br /><br /> Directing/editing, complex but understandable/vivid,<br /> delivering a constant shot of adrenalin.<br /><br /> Production values: Computer Generated Images are spectacular. Sharp,vivid,  real-er than real. Who needs reality anyway, these days?<br /><br />(( BUT, an example of reality rising above computer effects(by light years),<br />3 IDIOTS[[ASIN:B004XYF612 3 Idiots (English subtitled)]] It shows how good 'real'<br />can be. Yes, it's subtitled, but only brief comments and insertions of english  designed to make 'listening' easy... ))<br /><br />Back to TOTAL RECALL: I bought the Extended Cut (it extended the movie maybeeee  three minutes(!)) EH?.<br />It offers 'both theatrical and extended cuts' and promised four disks, which<br />turned out to be two disks, both BluRay, which has me discussing promises with Amazon product description folk - (I need DVD versions vs a BluRay for viewings away from my media room...) A-typical over-promises by Amazon product page and the Amazon MarketPlace seller's representations have me  severely irked...<br /><br />If I didn't REALLY like the film as much as I do, I'd ding down a few stars; but really, the  film's really fine. Just consider carefully the disk count, bonus disk, value paid-for, but consider what is value... etc.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Each Eytan Fox movie I have watched has been worth the time spent. Some more so than others. I found this continuation of Yossi's life interesting because he does not seem the dominant, powerful character he was in Yossi & Jagger. His character is well developed and progresses in an understandable and reasonable way, although not always as expected. Eytan Fox seems to usually leave just a little mystery and room for interpretation, which I enjoy. His movies are usually rich in human warmth and visual beauty. In Yossi I would have enjoyed a little more intimacy/sensuality, but it was still great without it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Still loving Dexter and the excitement the story line provides. What will they think of next? Great show that I will keep watching.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Love the game. It is like d and d on the kindle. Not a money sucker. I highly recommend you try this game.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|So glad to have found this totally enjoyable game.  It took me a bit to get it figured out, but what a great way to relax.  So far all the puzzles have been very bright and colorful.  The hot air balloons are my favorite so far.  Can't wait for more puzzles from HexLogic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is really fun and creative I get on almost every day with new ideas I've made towns and single houses and all sorts of things. In survival you have to lean to survive and find food and supplies on your own but in creative you have everything that you need right there at your finger tips.
B00821OX98|5.0|Just started watching it and its awesome!!! Can't wait to move on to season 2 and catch season 3 !!!
1451695195|4.0|whether you believe in God or not, this is a very interesting read. It's the right mix of faith and science that leaves you wondering what really happens in a near death experience. This account is very different from anything I've read. Quick read that's worth the time.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is a pretty intense show for &#34;regular&#34; television. NBC should be applauded for going out on a limb with this one.<br />Great, slow burn storytelling, with some seriously crazy kills to keep everyone a little off balance. Genuinely creepy!<br />Mads Mikkelsen is a perfect Hannibal Lecter.<br />One of 2013's best shows.
0307477479|3.0|Kept hearing great reviews, but I found it a little choppy. Some of the chapters were great and I didn't want them to end. Then some just seemed like they didn't fit.
B00003CXPD|5.0|The story takes place during the 1984 strike in England protesting the closure of some British coal mines. Billy's macho father and older brother are both miners, but father wants to cross the picket line and his son is violently union and even gets arrest during one of the union protests, so there's that interplay. Billy is supposed to be taking boxing lessons, but he hates the violence and is not very good at it. He discovers a ballet class held in the same building at the same time and becomes fascinated with it. The ballet teacher agrees to him joining the class, finds that he has talent, and gives him private lessons for nothing. When Billy's father and brother find out about the ballet, things get pretty heated. Eventually, after the ballet teacher lays it on the line, telling Billy's father that Billy should try out for the Royal Ballet audition, father reluctantly gives in and the older son goes along with it. Father accompanies Billy to the audition and the interview, at which time he seems to realize how lucrative a dance career could be for Billy and that it would save him from having to toil in the mines. Although it was not alluded to in the movie, It was rather obvious that Billy received a scholarship to the Royal Ballet school because otherwise there is no way his family could afford to pay. However, there are two omissions that bother me a little. After Billy passes the audition, the next thing we see of him is as an adult going on stage as the lead male dancer in a ballet, with his father and brother in the audience, so is this the first time they've seen Billy dance or just the first time they saw him dance the lead? Also, where has Billy been all this time? Has he lived in London in a dorm for students of the Royal Ballet, has he commuted back and forth from London to his home? I know they're both small things and some of you reading this interview may think I'm nitpicking, but I'm the kind of person who doesn't like anything left hanging. It hasn't diminished my love for movie, however - I'd just like to know! By the way, that final scene, when Billy goes on stage, is magnificent. Every time I watch this movie I rewind to the beginning of that scene and watch it a couple of more times. It's a rather short scene, but OMG - what a magnificent dancer and perfect use of slow-mo!!!n't diminished my love for movie, however - I'd just like to know!

B00992CF6W|4.0|my son loves this because his older brother was making a whole world, and well he needed to try and make one and it was easy for him, so i downloaded it for him and he just loves working on it, a great pastime. very similar to the one on the computer game on the internet. wish it was easy to download to the kindle fire, that was not so easy, but with patience i got it.
1612680011|4.0|I love this book and it is the fundamentals of why you need additional streams of income and a mind renewal from the traditional thinking of education and careers.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My baby loves this game , it is simple and doesn't need any gimmicks, it is easy and fun! He just moves the characters with the slingshot and let's go its that simple
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Nuff' said really! This game is spectacular, the artwork is incredibly cute, and totally draws inspiration from my favorite platformers including Little Big Planet, and Super Mario Brothers - wonderful game for all ages, and it should be a crime that this is even FREE!!
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|Just not great according to the eight year old viewer and LEGO afficiando. Some parts were a little weird according to him. Yet he never took his eyes off the screen or moved while watching. Really good in a four star way for someone at the top of the age appropriate group.

B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I love it!! Keeps me entertain. Works good on my Findle Fire HD. Just got it today and I love it. You need to have your own music to mix. That's fine with me :D good app for free. Thank you!!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I mentioned in another review that in the past year or so, I have become hooked on bingo. I play with several different apps and honesty, there are things about each one that either bug me,or outright annoy me. Bingo Blitz is my favorite, and the only bingo game that I play on a daily basis.<br />Blitz offers a free, five round, tournament daily. Daily ticket awards are sufficient for a daily player, and you are given the option of using your FB account to hook-up with friends that also play. You can send and receive tickets, power ups, and  keys. Room collections can be shared with friends, some can be requested. Like most apps, you can purchase through the game, but one can easily play without spending a dime. Five stars for Bingo Blitz!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love this program. DVR it every time. Don't know how this got in here. I must of hit the wrong button.<br /><br />The show is kind of slow at first. Not like the movie that was soooo good. And it's more like rich people that sit around and eat stupid people and don't know it.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I didn't find it that funny just so-so. I would have given just 2 1/2 stars if I could have.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Who doesn't like to be able to find out what the weather is like when you know you're going out, or you've been stuck in some place with no windows and have no clue what you're going to be walking out in to.<br /><br />This is a good thing for everyone to have.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is not an original lifeproof. It was a knock off and a piece of junk. Don't buy!! Fell apart and lifeproof told me it was a fake.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Our hero's keep dropping like fly`s and the intrigue continues to grow. Great stuff. On to the next one, can't wait!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Being a fan of Taylor swift for years, I really like that country voice but I don't think it's bad she's changing a little. Besides, is it really her fault? She's working with Max Martin -- best known for his collaborations with Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Typical Sanderson... a slow start setting the stage for what was a truly engrossing book.  Once I got passed the foundational scenes, the story moves along nicely and the flashbacks/forwards weren't so confusing.  Great interaction of the characters and a really original story line... can't wait for book 2!
B009NY43NY|4.0|A fun read.  Good for the beach.  A very entertaining summer book to put on your list. Is it really the last on?
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Its the freaking Hobbit!!! If you can watch this without reliving your childhood, you weren't raised right.  I saw the dwarves of my childhood as I'd always imagined them.. only they were better looking!! A great rendition of the original story and I'm definitely looking forward to the second and third!!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Weird but great theme/plot. Wish it would continue. The characters are quite unique. Sometimes a bit confusing if you don't watch each episode in order as there is a lot of switching back and forth from the two universes. Love the names that were given to the other universe characters like Fauxlivia and Walternate (Olivia and Walter on the other side)
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|don't bother with this app was totally stoopid and they want u to pay more for stuff..... not what i was looking for
B000MDJH9A|4.0|I don't really like \\"gangsta\\" type movies, but this one was decent. I liked how they showed the 2 main charaters friendship as children.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|This show is Awesome! Not like the campy, cheezy SG-1 or Atlantis at all. Much more dramatic and character driven. Characters are amazing, and it is well worth it to get both seasons.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Good book, lots of twists and turns. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast page turner.
B00402FGE4|5.0|This show is Awesome! Not like the campy, cheezy SG-1 or Atlantis at all. Much more dramatic and character driven. Characters are amazing, and it is well worth it to get both seasons.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the actor who performed the movie, but don't like the story. I feel like it is inhuman, too much killing.
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|My three year olds love everything Tim Burton.  This is no exception.  The characters are memorable and funny.  The story is great.  While the subject is morbid I suppose, it is not a dark movie.  It is funny and full of hope and a lot of joy.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|This is a great movie. I JUST finished it. I know I will watch it again very soon. I am confused, yet intrigued and hopeful. I believe it might take 3-4 viewings before I really, really get this movie. Definitely one of my top 20 movies of all time. I don't see how anyone could possibly give this less than 4 stars!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|For a while, I didn't have the full version. I got this and I loved it. It's way behind on updates, but it's still worth it.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I am a huge fan of google but the kindle version of feedly leaves much to be desired.  It crashes nearly I every time I use it. I frequently don't get to finish the article i was on.  I'm not sure if it's the kindle but videos rarely work as well.  I love the concept but I'm annoyed that is product is so unstable.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great story and cinematography.  Ang Lee at his finest.  This is a keeper and will watch again.  High recommend this movie.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|This book was gifted to me by my brother and I find it a great edition of Louisa M. Alcott's stories. The e-book has a proper formatting and an easy-to-use layout which made the reading enjoyable.<br />I can only recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great, theres only one problem. 0.7.0 is out but the kindles are not getting it. if you could do anything to fix this it would be great. ;)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My videos are not the real thing<br />I love it this games for kids and are not the world is great for kindle a new one of .
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Just an awesome move, great action, but he WS to be more powerful then Lokey  ......can't wait for Thor 2
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you haven't watched Downton, START NOW! Best show on TV! Humor, drama, incredible acting and beautiful scenery--it all draws you in.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Rec'd this on 6/3/13 and by 6/7/13 I have already watched series 1-6 of the 1st season. Love, Sex Murder and Vampires!!  What more could you ask for!!  With the way TV sucks lately with all the talent and reality shows, I will definitely be purchasing seasons 2-8!!!
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I love Chriss Cornell.However,there are some pusuits that should never be shared.This was one of them.Hate to dis the man,but he clearly is a way better artist than what this album represents.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I wish everyone would understand that we are all not cut out to be Tony Robbins nor do we want to be. Yet, leaders and inspirational people come in many forms and types. We put an awful lot of pressure, especially on young people, to be something that they are not!! No wonder we're a society of substance abusers!!!!
B005SZNZAY|4.0|We saw him do a acoustic set when he was in Audoslave during one of theur shows in Columbus OH.He is fantastic acoustic.own this.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|WOW! Couldn't put it own!! Incredible...can't wait to read her other books. Fantastic writer! A must read for absolutely  everyone!
B00APKIN1I|4.0|Really puts the artists in a different light.Most of these musicians have had carreers come &go&come again,so it was a bit odd hearing them sing songs on this album,maby not in their style or form.good album nontheless.The Paul McCartney composition is to me the best song on the album.Really gets your rock senses tingling.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Kate Morton is an extraordinary writer. She pulls you in with her enthralling characters and doesn't let you go even after you've finished......love this book! Thank you Kate for writing with such intelligence!  :-)
B002NXPTDK|5.0|Great tracks...cannot wait for new album love the make her say, marijuana, and heart of a lion tracks especially.  Good times.
B008L5G4I8|4.0|It has taken me awhile to actually read anything by Agatha Christie (except for Murder on the Orient Express).  I had always heard good things and now I can understand why.  While this is a classic mystery her writing is remarkable, especially since this is her first novel.<br /><br />Hastings is visiting some old friends when suddenly the mother of his friend dies (very dramatically).  An inquest begins and Hastings calls on his Belgian friend Poirot who happens to be in town to come and investigate.  Poirot looks into every possibility (even though her children and the other members in the household all point their fingers at her new husband, which nobody seems to like.)  Poirot flies from one thing to the next and Hastings has trouble keeping up with him.  In true murder mystery fashion the murderer was found out at the very end of the book (although there were points where I though the killer had been caught).<br /><br />I loved this book from beginning to end and found it delightfully entertaining.  Not only that but I didn't even try to guess the outcome.  (Most of the time I can usually see how a book is going to end and this time I was right on some accounts, but there were some surprises.)<br /><br />Now that I have finished the first in Christie's series involving Hercule Poirot I need to find the next one.  It was too engaging not to find what other mysteries Poirot will uncover next.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|What can you say?  It's the app for e-bay--you have to love it! It's quick and also easy to use.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I read many books in a year and have never written a review until now. James Altucher will entrance you , infuriate, you, make you laugh and make you examine your life in turns.  &#34;Choose Yourself&#34; has changed some of the ways I do things and some of the ways I think about things. I can think of no higher praise than that.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Can not stop playing this game.  Lots of fun and lots of challenges.  Downloaded it for my niece and now is one of my favorites.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This music is awesome! Like really the best. I went out with this Russian girl and I put this music in the car the next thing I know was we got a feeling.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Walt and his crew, especially his best friend Henry make for a great read. They are three dimensional characters whose interaction is some times laugh-out-loud funny and other times very touching.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is very fun. As other people have said, Paper Monsters does remind you of the PS3 game Little Big Planet. For me, it reminds me of LBP and a hint of Mario.<br /><br />The little paper guy makes a sound whenever you jump that sort of sounds like Mario. There are also areas in the game that make you remind of classic Mario block set ups.<br /><br />The graphics are very crisp and vibrant. The only complaint I have, and it's minor, is that the controls are a tad bit stiff. Other than that I would greatly recommend the game for any age!
B000I62JBE|5.0|This is a must watch for any one who enjoys suspense and thrillers. I mean Its different from other predictable movies. You smell something but you don't see it coming till the end. Lovely lovely lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed Norton's portrayal of the handicapped fellow. Acting at its best. Great movie.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Harmless scary movie.  The kind that jolts you upright..  A hoot to watch.  Some of the story line doesn't make sense, but overall worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think that Facebook is really neat and creative. It lets people meet new people and post pictures and text each other.<br /><br />I love Facebook it is my favourite app
B0063M22QO|5.0|I always enjoy this game and like the good feeling I have free playing a few rounds on my new kindle fire.  Thanks for the opportunity.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I like fantasy movies and over-the-top CG and explosions.  If you like fantasy movies and over-the-top CG and explosions, you'll like Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Have you read the books?  Are you looking for a faithful adaptation a la The Lord of the Rings?  Don't watch Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief.  The movie starts out pretty strongly following the books, then the director (Chris Columbus, the same guy who butchered the first few Harry Potter movies) starts chopping huge chunks of rather important or interesting plotlines out.  In the books, Percy had a &#34;whodunnit&#34; mini-mystery about who his father is.  In the movie, heck, it's right there on the back cover.  Where's the fun in that?<br /><br />Now, I understand that movies can't use all the plotlines from the book, but Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief drops the ball pretty hard and ruins plotlines that are in subsequent books.  I want to know how the heck future directors will be able to handle some of the major characters that were just completely left out of this movie who are pretty crucial to the sequel books.  Good luck to you folks...<br /><br />That being said, if you can ignore the books and just want a decent fantasy movie, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief will fit the bill.  The CG is well-done, even if it's a lot of Airbender-esque over-the-top elemental control, and the acting is superb.  I laughed my butt off when I saw Sean Bean was Zeus (hey, at least you know HE's not going to die, saving poor Sean from yet another tallymark in the &#34;Sean Bean Always Dies&#34; movie trope) and loved Pierce Brosnan as Chiron.  The witty actor playing Grover threw me for a loop, but then I just threw out my mental book-version of a pathetic, useless Grover and the comic relief was a lot better.  Uma Thurman as Medusa, however, she took the cake.  Flawless acting, perfect modern-day outfit, and just the right amount of creepy.<br /><br />Definitely a good movie if you can ignore the books.  I'm looking forward to The Sea of Monsters whenever it gets released!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I received my copy of Jungle Book right on time, and my granddaughter loves it. I keep lots of Disney movies at my house for her, and she has watched the Jungle Book multiple times already. The music is great and the story lots of fun for kids!
B0041D843M|5.0|I wish everyone would read this book.  I have decided to go Vegan and so far it is great.  I have so much more energy and feel so much better.  Great work!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Nice to see a movie that deals with reality as oppesed to &#34;Hey I'm Bi-Polar...I'll deal with it!&#34; Great movie!
B0053O89RY|4.0|I haven't watched the DVDs yet but the packaging inside was not good. One of the plastic brackets that hold one of the DVDs was broken. I could hear it rattling around before I even opened the DVD package. I'm sure the rest is great since i watch the show every week.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books and thought I was going to get more answers out of the third book...again, it left me hanging.  And  now we have to wait 7 months or more???  I am not a fan of waiting...and now I see you can buy all 3 books for $29.99 -  I am so glad other people can purchase the three books for a penny discount!  What a deal!
B008NABUU8|5.0|This game does a wonderful job of integrating geometry and fun by giving you the ability to use different angles and shapes to build a bridge. I enjoy the challenge it presents and the real world application. Great game
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|.. not historically accurate, but action-filled, etc., kinda' reminded me of 'Sons Of Anarchy' of the 8th century..not for kids...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have only the free version at this point. I have been using this app for over 3 months. The best features are: battery health checker, tests you're able to run, and the fact the time estimates are quite accurate.<br />I might upgrade to the paid version but for now I see no need. Thanks to the app designers that give free apps that are fully functional!
0679805273|5.0|This is a excellent book for any age group. We are going to pass down this<br />book down from generations to generations. Thank you dr suess for writing a great book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I don't play easy games.  But, I don't want a game that gives me a headache either....LOL This game was VERY intriguing and kept my interest to the very end.  Can't wait for their next game!!!!
B003CHGV74|5.0|I love this show and it's characters.  The writing is so well done and so clever, that I find myself on the edge of my seat, heart pounding during serveral of the episodes.  This is a must watch drama series.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book! Got a good flow to it.....gonna watch the movie this week-end....hope it comes up to the standard of the novel.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns. I expected there would be a fourth book considering so much was happening at the end. Very anxious to see what happens next.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have never, in my life, read a more beautiful book about the vulnerability of life, the transience we rarely see coming, and the ties that bind. This novel should be required reading for everyone, no matter who you are. Hosseini has surpassed the radiant truth emanating from his last two novels...my heart is both broken and renewed in this masterpiece.... words in general will never justify his messages. Thank you for this life-changing piece of art. My life, and my outlook in general, will never be the same. Khaled, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good book. I enjoyed the story line and the romance between the two. I recomend to every one who loves romance.
B00846REIS|5.0|At first  glance this book just sounds like every other one in its genre. Girl meets handsome, rich man and they begin a torrid affair. However there is substance to this book, the writing is really, really good, evocative and descriptive, rich with emotion and Authoress Day has the rare, deft touch that very few select author possessed to capture the subtle nuances of intimacy and turmoil in a relationship.<br /><br />I liked Eva and I liked Gideon, it takes a special touch for me to feel the intensity but I felt it with these two. They where intense and Day capture that out of control feeling that comes when you meet a person that makes you feel irrational at all levels. Really, this is some of the best I've read in the genre.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good book. I enjoyed the story line and the romance between the two. I recomend to every one who loves romance.
0425263924|5.0|I loved this book for more information. The twists on the characters is wonderful. Can't wait to learn more about Gideon in the next 2 books!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love it. I don't have to leave my seat to go to my computer if I want an answer to something. I wish I had downloaded it way before now!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The twists in this story had you rooting for the characters to get their acts together so they could be together.
B00049QQHI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and I caught this movie by accident on TV, but had to have the DVD as they cut so much out on TV. A very compelling story, based as it was on a real person. Something like this could happen to any one of us - inner city or not.
0670014893|3.0|I have always regarded Le Carre as the king of spy novelists. But is it me or is it him? I find his writing style over the years has changed--sometimes he seems to adopt a condescending tone towards his reader--as if he is up there in the top echelons of Britain's establishment and 'this is how it bloody well works, mate--and this is how we speak to one another in the upper classes and the top ranks of government'......His writing is also agonizingly elliptical in stark contrast to say, Len deighton, the prince of spy novelists..Now I have let off steam I have to say that in the final analysis I liked the book: I had to read it twice because I didn't get the plot the first time round. The reasons I think are that the chap in Chapter One whom I assumed was to be the main protagonist turned out to be an auxiliary, so to speak. The main character was much younger and appeared in the second chapter...though both of course had what in theater-land one would call 'leading parts.' The story revolved around an incident in Gibraltar orchestrated by corporate mercenaries on behalf of British intelligence. There was, as the British say, a complete cock-up and the mission ended in fiasco and disaster. But a tragic byproduct of the operation was the death of an Arab woman [a would-be refugee] and her small daughter. Thus the whole episode was covered up by the politicians of the day [New Labor's boss Blair among others] and our two protagonists [see above] found the facts too burdensome to carry and their consciences triumphed--hence the [delicate] truth will out. At the end of my second reading I was yearning to read 'The Honorable Schoolboy' or 'Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy'  once again!.
B007SPPANM|5.0|What's not to love about the greatest movie made about the Titanic?? Of course, the personal stories were fictionalized, but with Leonardo Di Caprio - wow!! The most impressive and realistic was the actual sinking and the Carpathia looking for survivors.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Wish It went a little further with the characters.  I love Sookie books but need more. She says its the last book but I hope not
B000N3SS80|5.0|This is a great album by one of the greatest artists in both film and music. This is the second Spanish speaking album I have bought. A good friend of mine who is Spanish, turned me on to this lovely form of music.  Thanks Rubi! Highly recommend!
0786891416|5.0|Gee, this Nikki Heat story reminds of a wonderful television series ;-) The chemistry between Nikki Heat and Mr. Rook is hot!
B000W91RUG|5.0|It's such a funny show!! Most people wouldn't just be straightforward with honesty, like the way Sheldon is.  I'd highly recommend it to others!!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very fun and addictive, easy to understand yet tough to master. A must buy for any tablet game fan. Works perfectly on my nexus 7
B00CL50KDY|4.0|This was quite the twist on the Romeo & Juliet story! I mean, seriously, who knew that 'romantic', 'zombie' & 'comedy' could all describe the same film? Overall it was a pretty good movie that was definitely entertaining. Once I realized it was an R&J style story, that kind of killed some of the uniqueness for me, but it still gets 4 stars.
B008469DGY|5.0|good and fun game if you are a golf fan. good graphics and worked great on my kindle fire. worth getting to help pass the time
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|While this did revolve around a love story, it was not overbearing to the point of being too much. It reminded me in some ways of the Twilight story, but I could actually stand to watch this more than once, so I give it 5 stars for being a good entertaining movie that didn't annoy!
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Would have been good to go into more depth on how they came up with the Navajo code program but heck this is a movie not a documentary.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Not too many things are really free -- I have enjoyed checking out the free books for my Kindle and meeting some new authors.
B00005V1B1|5.0|This is one of the best Progressive Rock Albums of the early 70's. The writing is very Melodic and Crisp. The Musicianship is awsome. In my circle during that time, we listened to this album often, very often.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Hmm mmm!  Wow, I'm speechless!  I'm emotionally spent after finishing this book. It was raw, hard, and open. How two people can love one another so openly deep. My crush on Gideon grew.  What's next for Eva and Gideon?  What happens next weekend?  I hope we don't have  to wait as long for book 4. Fantastically written!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is full of insight into the mismanagement of wheat as a product.  It is amazing to understand the biology behind the struggle for weight loss.  I recommend it to everyone, regardless of your health.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this story very disturbing. It was more so because it was so well written and the characters were so well developed. I sometimes felt sorry for Nick and other times angry at him. And his &#34;perfect&#34; wife&#34;' amazing Amy, was deranged, self-centered, intelligent, manipulative. She became more loathsome with each day. You got to know the parents with all their faults, Nick's girlfriend, so clingy, the cops who sometimes believed Nick and sometimes did not. Nick's lawyer was a colorful character too. &#34;Gone Girl&#34; was definitely suspenseful. It was hard to guess the ending. But when I got there, I couldn't believe it.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|One of my all time favorite shows.Never a dull moment. Worth watching over and over. Love all of the characters.
6305090564|1.0|Remember when \\"Alien\\" and \\"The Abyss\\" spawned a bunch of cheap knockoffs, where monstrous creatures would come from deep below the sea?<br /><br />Well, \\"Deep Rising\\" is perhaps the most insidiously wretched of that breed -- a witless, worthless puddle of bilgewater that snatches the worst traits of \\"Alien,\\" \\"Anaconda\\" and \\"Tremors.\\" To cover up its grotesque deficiencies, Stephen Sommers pelts the audience with guns and gore aplenty, but it's not enough to make you ignore the paper-thin characters and massive plot holes.<br /><br />Captain John Finnegan (Treat Williams) and his boat have been hired to transport mercenaries and torpedoes to an unknown location. Apparently he asks no questions, even if his engineer Joey (Kevin J. O'Connor) is almost beaten to death by the mercs, and then they hijack his boat. Great approach.<br /><br />The mercenaries' target: the brand-new luxury cruise liner Argonautica. But when they arrive at the ship, they find it deserted -- everything has been trashed and the people are mysteriously missing. The only ones who have survived are the ship's owner Simon Canton (Anthony Heald), Captain Atherton (Derrick O'Connor) and a professional thief, Trillian (Famke Jansson).<br /><br />It takes several scenes for the survivors to actually reveal what happened: almost everyone was devoured by vast tentacle-worms that have, for no explained reason, decided to come to the surface and attack a random cruise liner. And even though they've devoured almost everybody on the ship, they are still hanging around to devour the small number of remaining people.<br /><br />\\"Deep Rising\\" is one of those movies that responds to EVERYTHING with guns -- when they aren't blasting away at random with guns (oh no! A roulette wheel! SHOOT IT!), the characters are sticking guns in each other's faces for no real reason. It's as though Sommers is desperately hoping that nobody will notice how stupid his movie is, as long as he pelts viewers with graphic gore and gunfire.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is a moronic mishmash of much better movies. You have the implausible serpentine kills of \\"Anaconda,\\" the claustrophobic ship environment of \\"Alien,\\" and the sound-sensitive worm monsters that tunnel straight through solid objects from \\"Tremors.\\" Sadly, it has none of the logic or suspense of any of those movies, and mostly consists of idiots bumbling around in a half-flooded ship, doing absurd things in the name of the plot. For instance, even though the worms are unable to locate anyone or anything that isn't making noise... nobody ever stays quiet. They run around shooting and screaming, rather than hiding in complete silence.<br /><br />And there are massive plot holes generated by unanswered questions. For instance: why are these worms even ON the surface? How did they manage to squeeze into the plumbing? And how do giant tentacle-worms with NO EYES manage to navigate nimbly and silently, rather than banging into things?<br /><br />The characters don't help much, since they are so two-dimensional that they could be used as playing cards. Finnegan is a mercenary idiot who is shocked that never asking questions of a gang of nasty violent men MIGHT be a bad idea, O'Connor is obnoxiously annoying (even his voice is irritating), and all the mercs -- including Wes Studi and Djimon Hounsou -- are cartoonishly villainous and stupid. Only Famke Jansson's no-nonsense lady-thief is actually likable, and she STILL doesn't have any depth.<br /><br />\\"Deep Rising\\" almost evokes feelings of nostalgia for movies like \\"DeepStar Six\\" and \\"Leviathan\\" -- a painfully obnoxious, lifeless movie that fails to even be hilariously bad. Sink this one into the sea.ire.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is a moronic mishmash of much better movies.

B0058YPILY|5.0|One of the absolute best shows of all time. Love the action,sensitivity,drama, oh just everything about this show is wonderful.
0425263991|5.0|There has been more than one favorite author I have abandoned mid series because the 4th, 5th and 6th book tasted like  watered down martinis. A lot of good story arcs lose strength in many an author's hands no matter how talented or strong they start out.  Even Karen Marie Moning's equally strong Fever series only went for 5 books and did contain a bit of duplication.<br /><br />The Psy/Changeling Series is, hands down, one of the strongest series I have ever read.  The control Nalini Singh maintains over 12 books is amazing - plot, world building, continuity, characters, her ability to bring each book to a satisfying end yet keep us hyperventilating for the next one. Those writers who churn out ridiculous cliffhanger trilogies could learn a lot from her about how to please their readers and how to build suspense to a SATISFYING conclusion. And Singh cares for her characters. Every single one of them (and over 12 books you know there are many) are fully fleshed out - motivation, personality, character.  No duplicates, no cardboard cutouts. Well, okay Indigo and Mercy were similar. But they were both so interesting I didn't care, and they demanded respect from their future mates.<br /><br />Who is Kaleb Krychek? For the entire series I have been dying to see more of him, to know what makes this chimera tick. From the reviews I read, he turned off a lot of readers. But me? Serious fangirl here. Every miserly glimpse just tantalized me more.  I am okay with mentioning Kaleb since the first two chapters were excerpted on Singh's website and his name is the first word of Chapter one. Plus if you read Tangle of Need, you knew.<br /><br />You won't find out the name of the heroine until Chapter 5. Prepublication I had to go several times to a very good fan site that lists bios of all the characters to see who it COULD be. Singh hides her by keeping our eyes off her. My clue was the meager amount of info in her bio. In preparation for HoO I re-read almost the entire Psy/Changeling backlist to get a more cohesive view of the glimpses of Kaleb that appear in almost every book. Only once maybe twice is her name mentioned in 11 books.<br /><br />HoO answered every question about Kaleb I've been chomping at the bit to know:<br /><br />What was the major flaw in Kaleb's Silence?<br />What could possibly have happened to him at 7 years of age, to motivate him so strongly to become a Councilor?<br />What were those training gaps in his history?<br />How could a double Cardinal Psy be the progeny of 2 mid-level Psys?<br />Who has Kaleb been searching for ceaselessly, night and day, for 7 years and why?<br />Why did Santano Enrique choose Kaleb as his protege?<br />How would a Psy so pure in Silence, so cold, powerful, and dangerous, ever make himself vulnerable or mentally available to love?<br />And what woman could possibly be up to his weight?<br /><br />I've seen too many books where the character of dark, dangerous hero or the mad, bad rake changes when they fall in love. All of a sudden, hmm...they're not so bad. In Kaleb, Nalini Singh does not lie to us or change Kaleb in order for the heroine to love him.  He's still dangerous, cold in many ways, extremely powerful, still a killer, has an extremely weak moral compass.  But some emotions, especially those that get seeded in childhood, are stronger than all of that. Psys understand the value of loyalty and connection.<br /><br />The woman who matches him doesn't initially remember him, her mind too fractured after 7 years of imprisonment. She has no reason to trust him. Yet inexplicably, knowing what he is, she feels safe with him and attracted to him. He understands this and intends to use it to his advantage. But his strategy boomerangs back on him. And the bulletproof shields built to protect Kaleb's hidden fracture of Silence begin to fall.<br /><br />The backdrop to HoO are some of the most dangerous and volatile events in the Psy, Changeling and Human world, where terrorists causeunspeakably violent global events that kill thousands. Where there is a deadly virus in the Psynet that could take it down. Where The NetMind and DarkMind are still split and a broken Silence could kill millions of Psy. But where bastions of hope exist in the DarkRiver changelings' private Net, the defected Psys' Web of Stars and the Forgottens' Shadownet, perhaps, just perhaps, there are alternatives. The Psynet although over 100 years old is still neo-sentient and maturing.<br /><br />There are still lots of unanswered questions, but thankfully not about Kaleb. Thank you Nalini Singh for putting me out of my misery and leaving some nails on my fingers. Two more books to come, and I hope we see more Psys evolving, like Vasic and Aden, changelings like Kit (future alpha), and Forgottens like Jon and Noor.<br /><br />The psy/changeling series defies genre boundaries. You could shelve this series in Science Fiction as easily as Romance. And let's not forget the mystery! Nalini Singh simply has mad skills as a writer. She has given us an astoundingly good, absolutely riveting series.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Story lines are fabulous.Jared and Jensen have fantastic chemistry and you can really feel like they are brothers. Wonderful show.
B003KRJNBW|2.0|I enjoy movies and books about the end of the world/civilization and looked forward to watching this movie.  I ended up renting it from Amazon, paying about what the film was worth.  My overall impression was that the film was having a hard time deciding the optimal mix of ripping off \\"The Road,\\" \\"The Road Warrior,\\" Clint Eastwood westerns and various superhero films. Alert: spoilers below!<br /><br />Pluses:<br /><br />Good if somewhat stoic performance by Denzel.  Fairly realistic depiction of post-apocalypse cities, deserts and coastal areas.  I enjoyed the stylized action piece under the bridge early in the film, along with cat ambush at the beginning. The scene with the cannibal couple (prior to the arrival of the thugs) was well done.  The central theme of the power of the Bible, Christianity and faith was handled well.<br /><br />Minuses:<br /><br />Poor exposition.  What happened 31 years ago?  Why are so many people blind?  Where did Eli's extensive scars come from?  How is he so good a shooting, fighting and knifing people?<br /><br />Lack of realism.  Eli would need much more water than he apparently carried to cross the distances he did.  He is not going to get too far on that one cat, either.  The big disaster happened 31 years ago and there is no electrical grid, yet there are lots of vehicles are still running around with plenty of gas.  Gas goes bad within months, so there would need to be some refining going on the keep all of them running.  No shortage of ammunition, either.  The bad guys are running around with full-auto weapons with little regard for conserving ammo (or hitting the target).  Not much discipline with fires at night, either.  When they camped in the ruined cooling tower, a poor choice for several reasons, Denzel builds this giant fire that would have been visible through the gaps in the tower for miles.  As for Mila Kunis, she is too pretty for the apocalypse.  Her tight jeans and platform boots were interesting choices for going on road.  And who taught her how to drive?  Oh, and how is that the bad guys don't have enough gas to pursue, but Mila and Denzel can drive their armored Suburban all the way to San Francisco?  Then there is the rowing to Alcatraz.  Uh, not that easy.  The list goes on.  Even in a fantasy there needs to be some ability to suspend disbelief and stay the world being presented.  Not so much in this film.<br /><br />Who should see this film? Denzel fans and those really interested in seeing depictions of an apocalyptic world.
B001N3ELTO|5.0|This movie was compelling to say the least even though it was made in the early 80s. It kept me on the edge of my seat. If you are one that loves nostalgia for the 70s and early 80s then this movie would be right up your alley as it takes place in the beautiful New York City.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've been reading this trilogy (apparently the author was just kidding about that) since the first one came out. I always loved it and pre-ordered the books, so I wouldn't forget. But I was incredibly disappointed with this book. The ending is bulls*** and the rest doesn't feel true to the characters from the previous books. A lot of the book was kind of boring and dragged its way through. Even with the setup of Corinne and Megumi stories, the book could have easily and comfortable concluded within 100 pages. I see the setup in the next two books, but you can easily predict the story line. I've read a lot of Sandra Day's books, and can't help but feel she made a terrible decision about this series, which will end up costing her a lot of readers.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Thought-provoking and sincere. I've watched it ten times, and keep coming back to it. I'm very excited for the next sequel!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I downloaded the battery pro app I love that it tells you how much time you have before you need to charge the battery and it tells you the condition of the battery too it is a great app to have
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I've watched this movie SOOOOO many times and I still laugh every time I see it :) I love the characters and the storyline and I usually hate musical type movies but I love the music in this movie. This movie is a lot of fun!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited so long for this book to come out and was very let down... the first two book I loved was waiting for their happy ever after. Now I'm waiting for Giddion to run!!!! Eva sucks in this one. I would have never started this trilogy if I knew it was gonna turn into a series. Most the book is about hiding from everyone else. Then when they can be together n public  again its all drama. Very disappointed in the ending...
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I was kinda worried how this movie would be because I wasn't impressed with Nicholas Sparks' last book/movie The Lucky One. This movie was even better than I could've imagined though! I loved it! The actors did great with the characters and the story kept moving and was just overall a great movie! The movie was also very clean, no sex scenes and don't remember any swearing which was nice... hard to find movies anymore that don't drop the f*. It's a great movie and definitely worth your time to see it :)
0694003611|5.0|Most people probably know this classic book, so what's there to say? One drawback of the hardback edition is I'm worried how well the glue will hold up. Seemed like the backing could come apart after a kid spent some time with it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|May it run FOREVER.  Even on second viewing, which this was, it's still as good as the first time.<br />Now it's time to revisit season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is all about horrid g and if you like tenple run you'll love subway surfurers.. on the sub ways!!!!
0920668364|1.0|This book shows the mother creeping (literally, crawling across the floor) into her son's room at night at varying ages in his life and rocking him in his sleep. Cute when the kid is a baby, but creepy when he's a grown man and she climbs through the window with a ladder. The book ends with her being old and sick and dying. WHY on earth would anyone read this to a young child? Children are afraid of their parents dying. A young child doesn't understand the bittersweet nature of the circle of life, and I don't see any reason to frighten a toddler with thoughts of their mom growing old and sick and dying. This book has a sweet message for adults, who are able to read it figuratively (ignoring the bizarre imagery of the old lady creeping through the window at night), but is totally inappropriate for children, who read picture books quite literally.
B00A6RP8Z4|4.0|I really love the EP as a whole. The only thing about this edition is the remixes, which fall a little flat for me. The Penguin Prison Remix is alright, but the Lindstrom Remix is pretty bad. Unlike the other remixes of hers, such as those included in the box set of the Paradise Edition, these remixes fail to keep the song as a part of them and simply use one or two words sporadically with a club beat. So overall, it just didn't fulfill my expectations for some remixes. I think remixes of a different song might have worked better. EP Good, bonus tracks not really worth the extra money.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|excellent movie I really enjoyed it and I have watched it 3 times I was looking for the series as I would like to see more really liked this one
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I LOVE MY 3D SAMSUM 50 INCH FLAT SCREEN AND I LOVE THIS FLIM FOR THE 3D EFFECTS<br />NOT ALL FILMS ARE<br /> MADE TO GIVE THAT STUNNING EFFECT BUT THIS FILM HAS SOME REALLY<br />SCENES..  PRICE JUST RIGHT
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|I will have to watch it again as I didn't get it the first time a lot to follow many story lines intertwined
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was so looking forward to this book. There were some great sex scenes and the characters of Gideon and Ava grew as a couple but some of the minor characters I really didn't care for and really didn't care about. And then it was the ending. The book just literally stopped in mid sentence. Smh
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Kept getting message that my &#34;new&#34; Kindle Fire was running out space.  I tried everything but couldn't delete anything in the &#34;other&#34; file which contain almost 12 g of info.  This wonderful app cleared it all up in seconds and it is free!!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Twists and turns all over the place. It kept me page turning into the night. I could read it again.
B009EE4YWI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is not very faithful to the book, but it was still very well done and stands on its own. Recommend for parents with kids 10 and up. Some scary images such as Hades and the Hydra. The plot may necessitate &#34;the birds and the bees talk&#34; in order to explain the origins of demi-gods... But anyways, it was enjoyable, especially in HD and surround audio.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a game that our grandchildren just had to put on our Kindle. They enjoy it, so I lest them keep it on, so they could enjoy it once in a while while visiting us.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Basic history of Tesla's accomplishments and failures..... and the price was right! Quick read of a very interesting man who changed history.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|I liked it but it was not the best and I wouldn't want to watch it again but am glad to have watched it - other folks did like it and rated it better than I.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like the several views and the ability to choose several locations.  The i formation given is just what I am looking for.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I'm updating my review and dropping one star because the 'free' ap somehow morphed into a 99 cent ap after I purchased it. I wouldn't have even noticed it if it hadn't popped up as a free ap. I like it on my older Kindle Fire because it tells me which aps are using battery power and what percentage. You do have to select advanced and then usage. On my 8.9\\" Kindle Fire HD the usage just takes you to the device page. I'm uninstalling it on the Fire HD. The AP doesn't do a lot. One reviewer complained about the BAT/AC/USB that is under the battery on the page when you open the ap and says that the AC and USB don't work. If you plug the kindle in to AC, the AC lights up. So I guess that tells you that it's connected to AC. Barely worth the time to install. It does seem from other reviews and putting it on 2 devices that the features don't work the same on all devices. I don't think it's worth 99 cents.
B009PJ1Q82|4.0|When I watched this film I kept thinking, \\"How real this is as far as relationships go!\\" The story may be ordinary (drug addicted lover can't give up the drugs and realize the real prize of his life), but this story tells it with a twist. I truly loved the movie. The people who say that nothing happens in this movie must not have stayed with it to the end. Thure Lindhart plays a convincing role as a young gay male, Eric, looking for sex and unexpectedly finding romance. He falls in love, but his lover has a secret: an addiction to crack. At first they share the drug together as an overture to love making, but eventually Paul, the addicted lover, cannot move on, much less realize that the most important thing in is life is actually his lover, Eric, and not the drugs he uses. Their decade-long relationship is a veritable roller-coaster (as most are in real life) and Eric goes above and beyond trying to save their relationship, trying to help Paul kick the habit and realize how much Eric loves him. There are scenes that clearly show how much both men love each other, and their lovemaking is erotic and touching (though there is no full-frontal nudity per se). There are also some unexpected scenes that add a twist to this not-so-uncommon tale of jinxed love -- such as the scene where Eric is compelled to watch while his lover Paul is screwed by a male prostitute while he, Eric, sits on the bed next to them during the act. I found the acting to be quite believable, and overall, the movie definitely drew me into their unfortunate love affair. When Eric finally realizes he cannot continue down this path, he  cuts the cord to the one man he has truly loved for the past 10 years. And just when it seems that Paul may finally have gotten his life back on track, Eric realizes he cannot accept the terms that Paul has demanded of him for them to stay together. When the movie ended, I felt like I had been witness to an emotionally wrenching depiction of a ill-fated love affair, andalthough I longed to see Eric and Paul finally get the love they both deserved, I was not disappointed with the ending, which was not a \\"they lived happily every after\\" affair. To me this movie depicted the emotional trauma that so many modern relationships go through, only this time it was a tale of two gay men at once ok with their sexuality (so many gay films focus on the one character who can't quite come out or admit he is gay) and probing the limits of trust between two individuals traveling down different paths of life. I did not feel I had wasted my time watching this film. I have watched a LOT of gay-themed movies, and I would rate this as one of the better ones by far.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I sat on the edge of my seat. It was funny, exciting, a real must -see!  It was just as good the second time.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very good characters, well developed and likable. Pace moved quickly and good twists and turns, a great summer read. Looking forward to the next one.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Questing games  If your a person who likes games with a -lot of quests,  then you'll like Epic. Its great for yong ones that are 8 and up.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I had no idea what to expect out of this movie, knew nothing about it when I rented it. I was constantly thinking \\"Oh my God, this movie is crazy & weird\\", throu out the whole movie. Even when it ended, I liked how it ended but was still thinking to myself \\"that movie was crazy weird\\", & not sure if I liked it or not. And this is the strangest thing about this movie... It IS crazy and weird, nothing like anything I have ever seen (althou when I thought about it - it's kinda like \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" - that kinda vibe). Then I found myself constantly thinking about the movie, & the characters...& kinda \\"missing them\\"! I have a whole new respect & love for Bradley Cooper, & Jennifer Laurence (who I really don't know). This movie ends up making you wish you knew these people in real life (as CRAZY as they were), & could continue being a part of their lives.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I had been eagerly awaiting this \\"final\\" book in the trilogy since I finished the first one almost a year ago.  As much as I enjoyed FSOG, I preferred the Crossfire series by a mile.  I was extremely disappointed when the publication date kept getting further and further out (though the author claims this wasn't her decision, per her FB page), but I preordered it and then stayed up refreshing my Kindle every five minutes after midnight on June 4th because I couldn't wait to read it.  I was even more disappointed to find out we weren't going to get our ending as anticipated because Ms. Day has decided to turn this into a five book series.  I would almost be okay with that if I felt that Entwined was substantial and as fantastic as the first two books, but I felt that Entwined was ultimately lacking.  I still haven't quite put my finger on what changed, but something about it was inadequate compared to the first two books.  New characters were introduced that seemed unnecessary and inconsequential to the series, while our main characters (Eva and Gideon) couldn't even have a moment of happiness or bliss in the open.  Considering how long it took to get this book out, it shouldn't have been lacking anything.<br /><br />I'm undecided if I'll keep reading the series.  Supposedly, again per the author's FB page, the remaining two books will not take as long to be published - though that makes little difference to me at this point.  I'm pissed that it seems greed is taking over by pushing this to five books.  Mostly, I'm very sad that a series that was some of my most favorite reading ever, has left me wishing I hadn't ruined it by reading Entwined.<br /><br />Disappointing.  So very disappointing.
B008220D5K|4.0|I just turned 40, have 5 kids, & have been married for 19 years. This is EXACTLY what being 40, & married with kids, is like - spot on!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has great game play and is easy to navigate. That coupled with the multiple ways of obtaining armor, weapons, and power-ups makes this game magnificent.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Seemed to have very little content with Jack in it. It was an ok read, but I had to force myself to finish it.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The app works fine for small pdf files but lacks flexability when used for large service manuals. App wount let me jump to a page or allow indexing of manual content like ezpdf reader app does.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great app! , it does exactly what they claims, nothing less ,  it may even cite some types of cancer and baldness. But for REAL IT WORKS !
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was gripping, until the end. The ending was really blah. The rest was compelling enough that it was still worth the read but kind of a waste in the end, huh? It's like the author just got tired of writing, or got tired of thinking through the complicated plot as she identified with her characters. I wish someone had just told me to read to a certain page, close the book, and write the ending in my own head. I think a &#34;and they lived happily ever after&#34;, or &#34;no they didn't&#34; would have been just as good.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Nice concept, good idea! addictive ! Like it - it's worth the money. What else should i write... this is nonsense!
B000HZD168|2.0|I watched this after my girlfriend got so excited about the Star Trek movie that came out this year (2013). Certainly the graphics and special effects are dated in this movie. So is the acting and storyline. I wasn't made to care about anyone but the main characters. A better backstory would have made the characters' actions more believable. I suppose there's no reason to complain about something that can't change, so I'll summarize with I wouldn't recommend this movie, especially considering the many better alternatives such as the newest Star Trek movie.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this game can be fun. For me, its the fact that you can't really do much to progress in the game unless you spend real money to get in-game money. This really kinda rubs me the wrong way because as fun as it is,you're constantly spending about $10-$25 at a clip to get anywhere in the game. I would've gotten more had the next money pack not been $50. Can be fun, but you'll definately be wasting money of your own on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When iPod 's have the upgrade, it doesn't say upgrade on kindle fire. Also it is a good game because you can use your imagination.z
1451695195|5.0|As a practicing Christian, I found this book soothingly confirmatory about what I've always believed.  There's no doubt that belief is only augmented by a book of this caliber, where the author is a distinguished neurosurgeon and was himself a skeptic of the after-life before his own personal near-death experience.  Dr. Alexander's story is simply stunning, one that you'll have difficulty putting down once you've started.  Be sure to read through all the way to the last chapter.
0738737909|4.0|I would easily give this deck 5+ stars if possible because the cards themselves are wonderful. I don't know what's not to like about this deck, actually. My only negative comment is that my copy was clearly damaged somehow. Is it a huge deal? No, not really, but the left corner has been \\"bruised\\" or dropped or something. I had to take each card and gently reshape the corner to lay flat, but some of the cards have a crease that cannot be repaired. I guess some would find this trivial, but it was quite noticeable and now I do have a few cards with this small crease in the corner. I think I will just use this copy of the deck, order another, and hope it is better. Had I purchased it as \\"used,\\" I would have been more than pleased, but not as a brand new purchase. Otherwise, I LOVE Erik's beautiful work!
B000U6BT40|5.0|We don' t have cable so a real treat to find thru Amazon.  Already into season 2. This is a great show.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Cruise is unconvincing as a vigilante. I wasn't expecting much except for perhaps the action/fight scenes to redeem the otherwise predictably tepid plot. No luck there, this movie drags on like cold molasses for two unbearable hours.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This may not appeal to horror fans- it isn't scary. It's cerebral, and therefore best for people who can sit still and listen, not so much for people who need gunfights and chase scenes in their movies. Listening is well worth it- R's dialogue is both understated and funny and this is the best written comedy I've seen in a long time. I liked it so much that I went back to the theater and watched it again full price the next day. I don't know when I did that last- maybe never. I have Netflix and never buy movies anymore, but I'm getting this one. It's that good. Beautifully cast and acted too. Robert Levine was the perfect choice to play R. I can't imagine anyone doing this part better.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|This new remastered BluRay comes with amazing packaging and slip-sleeve.  I purchased it brand new from Amazon and it arrived in perfect condition, along with THE DARK CRYSTAL (also from Amazon).  The perfect double-feature for anybody who is looking to add 80s classics to their BluRay collection.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe this is how an entire series ended that started off so great. I was truly disappointed. I can't even believe Ms. Harris wrote this book. It seem lazy and just stupid.
B007ATNHLI|4.0|I ordered this used BluRay to add to my growing collection and was a bit disappointed when it arrived without the slip-sleeve.  Other than that, the disc plays great and the price was hard to beat.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|It was just that bad. The previews made it look so interesting, but with the constant cussing and throwing a man off a building It just was not my taste. I was sadly dissapointed in this tom hanks movie.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I forgot how amazingly bad these movies are, and I LOVE IT.  The collection itself is beautifully conceived and the restored quality of all of these films was so much fun.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon.  I purchased this brand new box set on sale at least 60% off the suggested retail price, and it arrived in perfect condition.  I highly recommend this BluRay collection.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's perfect, when the computer at home is being used... I can check my email on my Kindle... I love it.  Plus, I get notifications that I received an email...and that is great too.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has yahoo mail.
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a give up.  Anything else would have been better then this. Lets hop HBO doesn't take any ideas from this book.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is unpredictable and full of suspense and unexpected situations.  I read this book twice as quickly as the first book.  The characters are more developed, and although many outcomes to the various conflicts within the book are unsavory, and rather unsettling to the \\"fairytale-minded\\", you develop a strong love/hate relationship with the storyline, and it is difficult to stop reading no matter how infuriating the turn of event!<br /><br />I recommend this series if you don't mind seeing the antagonist gain the upper hand for faith that eventually good will prevail... although in all honesty, I think the author enjoys toying with the readers' emotions, and I wonder if good will indeed prevail.  None the less, I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it to those with a tough stomach for violence, and injustice.<br /><br />I will be reading book three to see where the story goes!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The language behind different flowers and how those meanings were applied was as interesting as the story involving  the girl, Victoria. It's a &#34;feel good&#34; plot and we all love happy endings or at least the promise of one.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Performance has been sketchy for me.  Playback sometimes ends mid-play.  I've stopped using it because it's just too much trouble.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|it has a very layered textured sound. If Pink Floyd, ZZ top, and Fu Manchu had a three way their love child would sound like this
0205313426|5.0|An industry standard for writers, publishers and editors. Not a light hearted read, but rather a book to have nearby to remind you of how to write. Rules, of course, are meant to be broken. We shouldn't, however, break the rules without realising that we have done so. This is the book that will tell you whether you are maintaining or corrupting the English language. It is patently clear that the vast majority of todays newspaper journalists have never read it.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Don't want to be a spoiler, so no plot discussion here...good movie, good action...some good twists and Liam does his &#34;thing&#34; very well
B008GFI418|5.0|I loved this documentary. George Martin is the quintessential music producer. How could he not be? He's the man they call the fifth Beatle, and he earned that title over and over during the stellar career of the Fab Four. Having said that, this DVD delves much more deeply onto the career of an immensely talented man, who has given us so much more than just The Beatles [as if that wasn't enough].<br />I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough to fans of the Beatles, music production, and the 60s music and culture generally.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was not a huge fan of this series when I started it.  Book one made me uncomfortable because Gideon and Eva are so messed up, book two didn't do much to help me like Eva very much because she is a bit whiney and Gideon playing games was irritating.  Corrine made me want to kill her and quite frankly Cary is a bit too easy in my opinion.<br /><br />However, this one was significantly better.  I liked that Gideon was so protective of Eva that he did what he had to do in order to protect her.  He sets everything up and it feels like a game of chess.  I kept waiting for the checkmate moment that hasn't yet come.  I still see the bottom falling out of this before all is said and done.  A lot of tears and heartbreak is coming, I just feel it.<br /><br />Corrine is the devil, I really dislike her.  I dislike Deanna and quite frankly I am not that impressed with Eva's mother Monica.  Deanna and Corrine have reasons to be angry and hurt by Gideon.  So I can understand and accept them.  Monica, however, is a pain in the ass.  Why in the world is everything about money and always about her and her feelings.  I found myself losing it when she would have chats with Eva.  If she were my mother, I would have cut her out of my life instantly.<br /><br />The supporting characters are as charming as always and Cary makes me adore him more and more every book.  He makes no apologies for being who he is and I can appreciate that.  He is about the only person who seems to be honest and upfront about anything in this series.<br /><br />I love that Gideon and Eva are married.  Hate that they are keeping it a secret.  Sigh....I'm conflicted on this series, I want to love it.  At least this book is the best of the three so far...to me anyway.  And apparently we aren't done yet....I have watched so many people lose it over there being more story to tell...how weird is that?<br /><br />I give this 4 lipsticks...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. Once you start it hard to put it down. Look forward to reading other books by this author.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have loved reading the Dead series and will really miss Sookie.  She was a great read.  That said, this was not one of Ms. Harris's better books.  It was clear throughout the story that it was written not from any desire to explore Sookie's world, but from the greater desire to never have to go there again. Ms. Harris is done with these characters and it showed.  The character conclusions were uninspired, occasionally forced and often unsatisfying.<br /><br />If you've followed the series from the beginning you'll definitely want to read this book. If you've never read the series, please don't make this book your first experience with it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book. Didn't end like I thought but still good. I hate to see the series end but look forward to the authors new books.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My class watched this after reading Romeo and Juliet. It helped me to get the point across to them that the theme of forbidden love is timeless! It was funny and not explicit whatsoever and the soundtrack quite appealing to this 40 something teacher.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the third to come out!  I love this type of fantasy but usually even the best books have an occasional lull.  This has not been the case with The Kingkiller Chronicles.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|i can understand wanting to keep your marital vows but sometimes things happen beyond our control,this was a excellent love story that went all the way around the ben but came back to square one,it's like your mother told you,anything worth fighting for wont come easy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My kids love Nemo so I thought I'd get this and they love to play it!  I enjoy it too.
B005LAII12|5.0|i wanted to see this for mark but ted stole the show,im a sucker for men in fur what can i say:)
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I can see what the big fuss was about this show! If you like Starz's Spartacus, you'll love this show. Warning for nudity and language.
B005LAII8A|5.0|i went into this without doing any reviews im just a bruce willis fan who wanted to see another one of his movies and i loved it,well worth watching over and over again,try not to read to much into it just enjoy the movie.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Again a great book! I have been reading Danielle Steel books since high school and loved every one!! I can't wait to read the next one!!,
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Awesome game I have played it for a long time for the very few times it skips to being its still a lot of fun. Definitely worth downloading
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use it with my Alzheimer's patient to relax her.it has so many options and was just thinking how great it is yesterday...it's priceless...I'd have paid more..
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Good book.  Good insights into things.  She supports her insights with data/facts.  Good suggestions for both work and home life.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie I seen it previously when I was  teen but wanted to see it again. I totally forgot Brad Pitt was in it as well.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny book.  I found myself smiling and laughing out loud as I read it.  She has good insights to things, but with humor. I recommend it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am a 26 year-old with 2 children, I would totally recommend this to all ages. I even play it,even though it's hard to believe. Thank you for reading this!!:)
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Read this book in two days. Quick and interesting read. Drama , college, and drinking. So of course I finished it quickly.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|The topic was important then and continues to be.  We women who have shared this horrible experience need to have a place to discuss their feelings, too.
0345803507|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line.  Aside from the education I got on sex.I have read all three books and enjoyed them.<br />at 85 I'm still learning.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Coin Dozer is just like the quarter machines in Laughlin casinos, except they don't have prizes in the real game. Entertaining, but don't plan on winning. You can only play a few coins at a time, so your money lasts a lot longer then most slot machine games. This app. was free, so even though chances of winning are slim, you still enjoy playing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Just niot my favorite app. for this game. Play it on my pc and sooooooo much better. To easy. the end
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I enjoy the app...it's pretty cool and handy. I would recommend it to others glad the Amazon store finally has an app for it
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Patterns choices are really nice. Very challenging . Really like the scoring and ranking for timed games around the world. My go game when not playing it on my pc. This is my brain exercise game and offers the best challenges. Have tried several different apps for this game. So far so good;
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|One off the few games I have ever become addicted. Throughout the day I kept playing until I had beaten. good times!
0783114893|5.0|Absolutely love Rutger Haier in this movie he's the bad guy but you feel like you sort of root for him. Excellent movie better than the new version.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is a very inspiring book and a great value for 99cents.  After I read the article on decluttering the closet, I put the book down, went straight to my closet and purged 2 bags of clothes that I no longer wear because they don't fit!  If I'm ever a size 6 again I'll just buy new clothes! :)  Thanks Francine!
B005K17RU0|1.0|It rarely gets the weather correct and never agrees with other weather report, I quit looking at it. Not to y liking.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Oh my gosh. I am such a huge fan of Jason Mraz. Be it his songs of passion, social commentary or wordplay I simply cannot stop rocking out to his catchy tunes. It was my great pleasure to know Luc and the Lovingtons. They are a Seattle based band whose lead singer Luc Reynaud co-wrote one of the first tracks on this album covered by Mraz. \\"Freedom Song\\" sounds like sunshine set to melody. \\"Livin' in the Moment,\\" \\"Woman I Love\\" and the rest of the songs on this brilliant love letter to the world do not fail to disappoint.<br /><br />There is something of a \\"throw back\\" feel to this piece. Mraz is old school romantic and an unstoppable optimist. Praise the Lord for this great man!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's pretty awesome and Clayton on the hunt for herobrine minecraft you watch the hunt for herobrine and Aaron on this site and rain forest in the hunt for a sexy lingerie the best possible freelance workers in this blog post on this blog was it fun land of the best thing that would have been a sexy in the first place for mincemeat herobrine minecraft you
B0064MGU98|5.0|this show has gripping drama, both personal and legal convolutions, and the endings are always a surprise, kinda like modern agatha christie
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love this app. I'm always at war with the battery and charging it. It's nice to see exactly what's happening.
B00846REIS|4.0|Reminded me a lot of 50 shades but with a better story line! Can't wait to read the next 2 :)
B00BX8653O|5.0|The soft neoclassical piano sounds are both exciting and calming.  Olafur Arnalds' music takes you to the epic highs reminiscent to the chilling winds at the peaks of mountains and and the soft breezes of misty valleys.  Added to that, the high toned vocals complete this work and make it a soothing and easy album for all occasions.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app it's awesome you guys should totally get it and it's free that's awesome too. I love that they added new places and vehicles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun for kid  an  some adults too so yeah it is a game about when a girl o  a boy draws on a train then the guard trying to catch you so that is all what the game about.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game its both fun and awesome to play I enjoy it, tho I will say getting investment points is diffult but that's okay
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Great movie.  One of Clint Eastwood's best.  Take or leave my comments as short or as long as they get.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|Too much profanity and nudity . Good idea for a series but too much other stuff as is the case with many shows these days.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like most reviewers, I loved the first 2 books.  Read them in one day, this book was slow and I had to force myself to finish it.  I thought this book would be from Gideon's POV since the cover originally say Gideon's story...  No such luck.  I don't mind that there will be 5 books instead of three, but I do mind not getting a good book 3 to make me stay around to book 5.  There are a LOT of secondary stories, too many and they take away from Eva and Gideon.  I am really starting to dislike Eva too.  OMG, in book 1 she was a strong women who knew she had issues and was working on them, now she is an insecure wining brat.  Lying to her best friend Cary, having a date with the ex-boyfriend Brett, but confessing that she loves Gideon... really, I don't think so.  Brett used her for sex, then created a music video from their time together in explicit detail and she talks about how sexy his voice is, instead of telling him to get lost!  There is also too much fluff, the long taxi ride in chapter one, too many lunches with Will, the new guy in the office.  The stories about her mother and father. Too much drama with Cary, who I loved in the other books and now he is really a drama queen in the book with two romances.<br /><br />Gideon continues to have secrets and his story is definitely not told in this book.  SPOILER:  Unless you consider the short paragraph about Ann Lucas's brother committing suicide and leaving a son behind.  What about Gideon and his family especially his mother.  Elizabeth shows up in the last chapter for two seconds sees Eva then walks away.  Also what is the deal with Dr. Lucas's wife Ann who also shows up in the last chapter.  What about the brother, Christopher, who was at the video launch, then nothing.  What happen to Ireland and building a relationship with Gideon.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  Why create the stupid Russian mob murder story, Nathan is dead, let that story go and move on to something else.  Why have Gideon bring Corrine's husband toNew York, if they are not going to get a HEA and go back to France, the miscarriage was unecessary, it only served to cause Gideon pain.  Even Magdalene got a new man and appears to be happy.  Gideon and Eva got marry, so what, nothing changed.  She is still insecure and he is still keeping secrets.  What happen to couple's therapy, what happen to just talking to each other instead of at each other.  They need to build a relationship outside of actively having sex as Eva said in book 1!!  That doesn't happen in this book, every time they are in the same space the clothes fall off.<br /><br />As for all the lose end, there just isn't enough Gideon and Eva story.  I am happy Mark and Steve are engaged.  Too bad Will can't eat pasta at home.  Cary having a baby!!  The other girl whose name I can remember, at the front desk, she got sick and disappeared.  None of that drive anything related to Eva and Gideon and that is really the reason most people were ready the books.<br /><br />Ms. Day is clearly creating plots for the remaining books, but I won't be around to read them.  The SNIPPETS and SNAPSHOTS told a better story than the book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fast paced and thought-provoking. Strong characters who you can connect with - good and bad. I was put through a rollercoaster of feelings and thoughts much like Jacob's parents must have gone through. I will have to read other novels by this author.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Note: Amazon combines ALL reviews of a film together whether it be the theatrical version, the streaming version, the DVD or the BD. So it's always advisable to sort reviews by date and note which version is being reviewed. THIS review is of the DVD.<br /><br />I saw this wonderful film last year at the Philadelphia Film Festival and immediately told all my friends to catch it when it hit national release. As you can see by the reviews posted here already, those who have seen and loved it have sometimes seen it more than once. If you have only seen it once, I urge you to get the DVD when it is released later this month. Not only will you get to savor some of the wonderful dialogue and acting again but the bonuses will make your experience even better.<br /><br />Both the DVD and BD contain two \\"bonuses\\". The first is a series of \\"making of\\" featurettes covering the directing, casting, music and script. There are seven of them that can be played separately or as \\"all\\". They are really short and total just 14 minutes, but worth watching. The other bonus is the full length commentary track by Director Dustin Hoffman.  I don't always have time to listen to these but, in this case, I'm glad I did. It is probably one of the best commentaries I've heard. Hoffman provides insight into many scenes and lets us know the many times the \\"dream cast\\" of actors for this \\"independent\\" film (thankfully picked up by the Weinstein brothers) are adlibbing their lines. There is just enough dialogue included to blend in with Hoffman's discussions to job your memory but not fill it with too much. The 98 minutes went by quickly and I felt I knew the film better after hearing Hoffman explain the casting and the need to some scenes.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to tell you about the plot - though I think you'll do best to discover it yourself.<br /><br />With the great lines - and the great music - all filmed \\"live\\"!;no lipsynching here -by real musicians and singers - this is a film you can watch again and find something new each time.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"ou can watch again and find something new each time.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|Need the new update for the kindle fire! I love this app, and would recommend it to any minecraft lovers.
B00BN4U6VA|1.0|Couldn't watch it for more than twenty minutes: so slow an action, so fake an acting.  Spent two enjoyable hours on &#34;In Search of Beethoven&#34;, instead.  Recommend that, not this.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|For the first five minutes or so I though this was going to be a JB of note.  Then, nothing.  No worthy women, poor special effects, a lot of talk and an attempt to make Judith Denning an action hero.  Really!!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Excellent presentation of history.  The acting, the costumes, the dialogue, and other important historical facts get put into perspective...you are introduced to impt historical figures very early on in their lives.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I must say that if it weren't for Jennifer Laurence I would not have been nearly as attentive.  In my mind, she carried the whole thing.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Not an easy story to read at times, yet beautifully written. A perspective of the holocaust of which I was not familiar.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This was a really gripping story done with sensitivity and feeling.  I think Helen Hunt deserved more consideration for an Oscar.  This was far and above her best effort.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|Everything they do is just a little different with a twist that makes them just a little better than any other group.  The music is wonderful, the singers are wonderful.  I saw them perform with The NY POPS and started getting their albums. The Holiday album is especially fabulous.<br />ENJOY
B00BF11STU|3.0|Too much emphasis on  picturing water boarding.  Otherwise pretty dull except for the last 20 minutes showing the  helicopter attack.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Not sure if its because I knew it was the last one but I didn't enjoy this as much as the others. The ending was disappointing and the rest a bit, well, dull.
B004EF65QA|5.0|If you like downton abbey you will like this. The characters are well done and the plot keeps you watching
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Had some high expectations for this app. once opened it just took me to my email to send them an email. Garbage; not worth free.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There are a lot of twists and turns as the characters live thru the war. You grow to love them more and more as the war makes them real people
B0050ACXBE|4.0|Interesting movie, I've seen it before, wanted my own copy to rewatch some scenes, and to compare to &#34;Gound Hog Day&#34;, which many have suggested is the basis for &#34;source code&#34;.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|This book was recommended because I read Escape From Camp 14. It's unbelievable the hardship that exists in North Korea. However I feel that the book sometimes repeated itself when bouncing from character to character. Overall if you are interested in North Korea this book does a wonderful job.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Addictive and beautiful. I wish it let me use a higher graphic settong than &quot;low&quot; because on smartphones this game SHINES! Controls are a bit glitchy time to time but it doesn't hinder gameplay enough for me to be annoyed. Overall I can't put this game down!
B0038TWHP6|4.0|Liam is perfect for the role, you can't go wrong with this if you are interested in the history of the troubles
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like to drive so I liked it but I kept like flipping the car over so not good lol
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have an FX-8530 processor<br />Was running 65+ C when under load with heavy video editing without any overclocking using the stock cooling fan<br />Replaced with Coolmaster and dropped temperatures by around 10 C when under load<br />Almost silent unlike the stock cooling fan<br /><br />Good option if you don't want to go with water cooling.<br /><br />Of note: The heat sink / fan combo is big and takes up as far as height almost the entire width of the case.<br />Not sure if my original case would have been wide enough for the heat sink / cooling fan.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Sorry del Toro, your leap into Hollywood has made you another cgi victim. While the story of Mama is interesting, the more you see \\"mama\\" the less you want to see, simply because cgi monsters/ghosts do not work.<br />Please del Toro, get back to your \\"Devil's Backbone\\" and \\"Pan's Labrinth\\" filmmaking style and spare us the overblown, empty Hollywood effects laden tripe.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|For a long time, I had been looking for Enya's music videos on DVD<br />Bought them long ago on VHS but don't really watch VHS anymore<br />If you love Enya's music videos, this is a great choice.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I have been a le Carre fan for many years.  Indeed I am of the same age as the author and hail from the same country.  I recognise whereof he writes.<br />In &#34;A Delicate Truth&#34;  there are sparks of his former tart and sharp perspective, but I found the narrative disappointing.<br />To me it wandered, lacking the sharp focus that defined previous works . Even the characters seemed to lack the  &#34;'strong frailty&#34; that  were the hall marks of previous works. The ending, unless he breaks with his tradition and writes a sequel, was truly a let down.<br />Overall, I came from the book a saddened reader.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a relatively easy game to play. I got it when it was free and I I've been happy with it ever since.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great app I love to play it! Definatly a must have. So much fun!I would tell all of y'all to get it. Great way to relax.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Have not had time to download books yet and give it a good test drive but its a neat idea.
B009EHDU7U|2.0|This is a story that beggars belief. The main character meets and influences every political leader of the twentieth century, as a kind of modern Candide, but certainly without Voltaire's subtlety. It just goes on and on, with innumerable and unbelievable twists of the plot. It might be bearable if it was funny, but it's not!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great game trust me. I know it might seem a little expensive,but it's worth the money. You will not regret buying it! You can build anything at all with these blocks and other tools. Fun for any age. You can make furniture and break trees and other really cool stuff. It also has the best multiplayer games where you can join friend's worlds. I give it a huge thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!
B001QJUX24|5.0|One of the best westerns John Wayne has ever made.  The photograpy is outstanding.  I would recommend to all my friends and family.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty remade some of his top hits with artists...Theres some slight differences in the music, but I love this CD..I hope he comes out with more....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just download this on my Kendal I have not had much time to look at it yet, but the small amount of time that I have view it I can see this is a wonderful Bible.This is very easy to read and under stand what you just read.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|The data base they have created for this app is quite amazing.  Akinator has guessed almost every character I have given him, and some of them are pretty obscure. It's really fun to play with other people, too.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Similar to what you can get on a regular computer-just a lot smaller<br />can be difficult to read at times.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is a great book! I love it! I finished it in 3 nights!!!! It's actually everything that I do enjoy reading about, which for me is hard to find ...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting months for book 3 and now we have another one to wait for....Such a disappointment!! I would love a refund.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't used this a lot so far, but I can see where,ot os going to very useful in the future.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is what Android Gaming should be.  It's the best sidescrolling platformer game to come out since the original Cordy.  Levels are multi-layered, characters are adorable, graphics are beautiful, and gameplay is solid.  I recommend this game to anyone who wants a 'real' game for their devices.  Plays great on my HTC One X, NookColor, Acer A700, and Asus Slider SL101.  I purchased this on Google (hence no Amazon Verified thing).
B00CXN2JNS|1.0|This isn't the same DM from the 80's, 90's or even the early part of the last decade...and I don't mean he's gotten better. I went into this with an open mind and ears and I'm just shocked by how lackluster his writing has become. Musically it's a good effort but lyrically he has lost his way. Perhaps his revelation over the last few years conflicts with his prior headspace as a writer.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So far it is wonderful.  Except sometimes it jumps back some pages, but all in all great for reading on the go!
B00011CZRE|5.0|A true thriller. I liked this movie when it was originally released in the 90's, because the plot line is taut with tension. the dialogue  comes across as genuine. Freeman, Pitt and Spacey are an awesome collaboration of talent
B003B02O7I|5.0|The Testament is anther great book by John Grisham.<br />A little different in its theme, but a book one cannot put down.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  My husband thinks I'm crazy, but I do!  Maybe it's the nerd in me, but I have small goals and love the strategy behind deciding how and were to spend my &#34;money&#34;.  I haven't used any money to purchase food or dragoncash, it's all been through patiently collecting through play.  That is either a good thing (&#34;I earned it!&#34;) or a bad thing (my park is way too cool to have not spent a dime on it....that means I play way too much!&#34;).
B00BHMETKC|5.0|As with just about every movie out there today, I could have done without all the curse words, but the movie itself was great! I was on the edge of my seat until the end!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Didn't get to see this in the theaters, should have, it was fantastic.  I loved this movie.  Western genre at its best with a Tarantino twist!  A must see for adult movie goers!
B008XK69S6|4.0|I like it so far but I purchased the unlocker for the full version and have yet to receive it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good easy to play game. kids of all ages will enjoy caring for and competing with their own horse. its a great way to spend an hour.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read the book before I saw the movie. The book has delightful moments, which may sound strange, but mental illness doesn't run in a straight line. I loved that the characters go a long way toward showing the individuality of people with mental illness. We have to talk about m.i., and write about it, and make movies about it to work towards a time of less stigma. I loved this book and recommend it highly.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Enjoy using it. My husband and I enjoy using this app.  I would recommend it to anyone.  But only if you want to keep your eyes moving.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|An okay diversion. Not bad, not great. Since I live near here, I wanted to see how Southport looked in the film. Not much suspense was built-- Hitchcock would have done it better, but that's just me grousing. For what it is, the movie is a couple of hours of escape.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is great movie it was shipped quickly. One two movies that I liked by Quintin Tarentino. Not a big fan of the others.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Breath taking armor detail and fun temple run feel. Can't say I've played better mobile movie based games on any tablet or phone
B00BB22GQM|5.0|My favorite album will always be their self-titled one. Modern Vampires of the City however is still a wonderful piece of work. For me, it took two listens-through to really appreciate it but I definitely think it is worth your time. It's different than their other albums, yet also similar. It's just something new that I think everyone ought to just listen to, twice, themselves before deciding what they think of it. As a Vampire Weekend fan, I definitely love this.
B00821OX98|5.0|Rewatched Season 1 & 2 getting ready for season 3 premere<br />Can't wait for Sunday night. Skitters beware !! Why watch neywork TV<br />anymore
1469220717|4.0|Entwined With You appears to be more the love/obsession story between Eva and Gideon than anything else this time.  Not that it wasn't in the first two installments - just more so this time. I am intrigued with how it went.<br /><br />Sylvia Day is an accomplished writer so the book is well written, as expected.  (Maybe a tad too much microscopically graphic sex  :-) but what the heck.)  That said...what intrigued me is encompassed in two old adages:  \\"A leopard doesn't change his spots.\\" And \\"Old habits die hard.\\"  Or...maybe I've known a Gideon type of man or two and suspect things aren't quite as wonderful as they seem.<br /><br />So... just what is Gideon Cross really up to?  God knows all of us readers know Gideon is a coldblooded, domineering,seriously psychologically/emotionally damaged, power driven, control freak of an S.O.B. character.  Now he's a quivering, hopeless mess over Eva? Practically a saint?<br /><br />I know there are other characters brought in to add some annoyingly distracting little crawly critters to the beach party - like the receptionist missing work for a week and out of contact, the old flames - both Gideon's and Eva's, the Russian mafia, the roommate with his crisis, Eva's mom and dad, the suspicious police detective, and so forth - but where is all this leading?<br /><br />Guess we will have to wait to find out, but I am thinking that Eva's character's hesitancy about things, and her gut feeling that things were moving too fast was/is right and there is going to be some major disaster coming right around the corner.<br /><br />Noticed a bunch of complaining about expecting this installment to be the last in a \\"trilogy\\".  Well, I hated to see the really big ones - like the Twilight Saga - end, so as far as I am concerned ten more of these installments is fine with me.  LOL!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next installment.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This was such a tragic event, but thankfully, even though many years went by, Jaycee was still alive.  I can not imagine what she went through.  The book tells of such courage and unimaginable accounts of what went on in those years of capitivity.  Jaycee was able to convey these accounts in clear detail.  I admire her for her courage and the ability to write this book especially since having to go over every detail.  This book gives us all hope and to never give up.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This is definitely a new direction for the robotic duo, but still has their iconic sound at it's mechanical heart. Daft Punk stepped away from synthesizers and toward live instruments, so the sound is definitely more &#34;organic&#34; but the layering and complexity that has always been present in all of Daft Punk's music is still there.<br /><br />Anyone who liked Daft Punk simply because it was good EDM will ultimately be disappointed by this new direction. However, those who appriciate the musical complexity, layering and &#34;feel&#34; will find many more things to love than they can complain about. My only complain is the step away from EDM, but in the face of this amazing album, it's easily overlooked.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I missed out watching it in the Cinema in 3D but now its coming out on Blu-ray \\" WHY \\" is the 3D Version not included and\\" WHY \\"is it a two Disc Set if I really only need the Blu-ray Disc...? 31.00$ without the 3D....? You Guys are funny....? Ill Wait till its for 19.90$...
B003FSTN6Q|4.0|This was another good season for Ghosts Whisperers.  I was very disappointed to hear that they were canceling this show.  I especially liked the two games at the end.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What a disappointment...I have been waiting so long for this book to come out....I agree with the other reviews about her trying to draw out the story line to much. She opened all these doors during this book and left you hanging with all of them.  I loved the first two books so much....but this was the worst book I have read all yer.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|My girlfriend went to the see the new one and told me it was good.  So I watched this so I would be up to speed for the second!
B007SOQBCM|1.0|I was very disappointed with this app. There is no search function, and when browsing a game, you only have access to about 20 streams. I'd like to view streamers that are not Voyboy or athene... this app needs major work.
B001XUNOSQ|5.0|Always makes me happy when I watch this movie.  I just bought a new hd tv and the color and depth was amazing!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone starting out in the IT Field. So much so that I am going to attempt for it to become part of the IT program at my school.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I have always loved QOTSA for the sheer sonic complexities of their songs. This album doesn't let me down. For anyone hoping for Songs for the Deaf, you'll likely be disappointed. But if you want elements of all of their albums, some of the fuzzed out guitars from &#34;R&#34;, some of the piercing sonic clarity of &#34;Lullabies to Paralyze&#34;, some of the manic driving rhythm of SFTD, some of the jagged pieces from &#34;Era Vulgaris&#34;, you'll find it here.<br /><br />I recommend listening to it straight through, it just all fits. But is you want individual songs, you should listen to &#34;I sat by the Ocean&#34;, &#34;My God is the Sun&#34;, &#34;Smooth Sailing&#34; (which is a hell of a lot of fun), and &#34;I appear missing&#34;.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The characters drew you in to the story line and into each home. The actors are seen in other shows which makes it all the more appealing.  The postmistress weakness were endearing .  Sad to see it end.  But if you loved this you should watch Call to Midwife.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Liked the original better. ..the whole energy thing and voucher things are annoying but lots of options for building stuff
0385536828|5.0|I expected this Ian McEwan novel to be wonderful and was not disappointed.  Towards the beginning i started to feel that the words were a little uneven.  Not quite as spectacular as I was prepared for.  Still very good, just not flowing the way i was expecting.  Guess what?  There's a reason!  A PERFECT reason!  That I won't tell you because it might ruin the experience.  The end explains it all.  I was starting to doubt my understanding of McEwan's abilities and now am shaking my head at his skill.  Money well spent on this book.
B009PLKCEE|5.0|I recommend to all this software, very helpful and affordable you're gonna love it! Once you try it you'll stick to this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a very interesting and fun series!  I cannot wait for this movie to come out.  I am totally excited!
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This game is very enjoyable and addictive. I can't seem to put it down. You have to eliminate rows of demons, but you have to complete it in the right order or all the demons will not disappear. You have to think about your moves before you begin to eliminate. I love this game, it gives your brain a workout.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|TThis book was very easy to read, entertaining, and very hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a life ruiner. I don't think I stopped crying throughout the whole book. Definitely a good read.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet because I bought it for my granddaughter.. She won't receive it till the end of June, because she will be coming to visit at that time, but the packaging looks beautiful. I'm sure she's going to love it.. I just wish it would have arrived when she was here. She had to leave before it arrived after I originally ordered it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|love all the flow games and this does not disappoint - you will enjoy the new lights and colors and sounds!
B0094K1QR8|3.0|I chose a three star rating because the movie was just a good way to pass the time.  I did like the way they showed different time periods in their lives...a nice touch.  Other than that it was just your usual angst over romance.
