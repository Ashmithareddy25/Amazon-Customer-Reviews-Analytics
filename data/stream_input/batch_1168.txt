B0015DROBO|2.0|Be aware this book is DRM. I bought it..I should be able to read it on the device that I choose.
B00000269J|4.0|I really did not like this album too much when it came out and at the time, had pretty much given up on new progressive music.  As I recall, my objections to A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) centered on the lousy 1980s production choices: a \\"big\\", heavily echoed snare drum; some electronic drums; and \\"wishy-washy\\" digital synthesizer tone colors.  Although I still do not like the production choices, this album has gotten a little better with the passage of time.<br /><br />The music is generally pretty good.  My favorite track is the moody, keyboard-heavy instrumental that opens the album.  My least favorite track on the album (and of their entire recorded output) is Dogs of War.  This track just does not work very well and its corporate rock textures do not mesh well with the other material.<br /><br />Dave Gilmour is in great form and his singing and playing is impressive throughout - then again, he was always the \\"music\\" guy, whereas Roger Waters was the \\"concept\\" guy.  Speaking of which, the absence of Roger on this album is noticeable.  Then again, although the \\"heavy\\" concepts are absent, this was 1987 after all, and deep thinking had pretty much been thrown out the window.  We also get to hear a lot of supporting musicians, including bassist Tony Levin, drummer Carmine Appice, and a few others including original member and keyboardist Rick Wright.  Regrettably, the music had been written before Rick came on board, so his presence is not particularly noticeable.<br /><br />This version of the album, while not remastered, features a nice color booklet and good sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, this can be viewed as a Dave Gilmour solo album.  While not a favorite, I still listen to A Momentary Lapse of Reason on occasion and I certainly like it a lot more now than I did in 1987.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great replacement for the Samsung Gmail interface. Excellent widget options (size and variety). No unnecessary battery drain to speak of. Great calendar replacement app!
B000EXZH5G|5.0|I like this album as much as - or better than - the first three (with Lou and Murph), with the possible exception of \\"You're Living All Over Me.\\"  The raw sound of the first two albums has its merits and I love those (\\"Bug\\" not so much), but I also appreciate the production quality of \\"Where You Been.\\"     Moreover, a lot of the songs J played acoustically in \\"Martin & Me\\" come from this album- \\"What Else is New,\\" Keeblin',\\" \\"Get Me,\\" and \\"Drawerings\\" (Kurt Fedora- best acoustic solo ever!) are awesome jams on that album and I dig the originals found here.    I don't find a lot of deep meaning in the lyrics, but the way they're delivered is unique, and the guitar is just perfect. Great album, definitely J's best and maybe Dino Jr's best. Call me heretic!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Symphony X is back with Iconoclast.  Another masterpiece worth the wait.  This album is a continuation of the \\"Paradise Lost\\" sound.  If you liked the previous album you should like this one.  Album kicks off with the title track that is epic from the beginning.  The musicianship is incredible on every level.  The first song (Iconoclast) is 10 minutes long.  This band is so good it flew by for me.  Not boring for one second.  MUST PAY ATTENTION.  The tradeoffs between the keyboard soloing and the guitar soloing is fantastic.  At times the music runs into speed metal.  This album is all over the place with tempo.  Well done Symphony X.  Soloing is as we all know worth listening to.  Romeo is a genius, there I said it.  Well he is.  This band is in their own world.  Exciting riffing with flash transitions.  Russell Allen's voice is top notch on this album.  A pure singer.  His power brings this album alive and compliments the music.  His voice soars in waves of emotions.  Choruses are great.  Some of them are like three words long.  They made it work though.  I love bands that take their sound and keep coming out with quality albums with no rushing material.  Every track sounds like they took their time to hash it out.  Favorite songs are Iconoclast, End of Innocence, Children of a Faceless God, When All is Lost, The lord of chaos, and Reign In Madness which is mind blowing.  This album is a keeper for us all.  Did not disappoint me at all.  A gift to metal heads out there.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|Though the science is a bit unconvincing, and the underlying premises are not fleshed out I loved this book.  The characters and the cultures were really impressive and surprising.  Very convincing and drew me in completely.  The plot has a varying pace that really kept me interested.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Majority of the songs are are great! She has grown lyrically and sonically. She sang her ass off on each song . The album would have just been perfect with the exception of 3-4 filler songs. It's all great though overall :]
B0020BUWX2|5.0|If I Stay was a truly beautiful book. Seriously one of my favorites. This book changed the way  looked at my life. My heart ached for Mia at times and was warmed by others. And Im not a big crybaby, but this book was an exception. I also love the sequel Where She Went. Gayle Forman is a true artist.
B002VECM4A|5.0|What was so precious about Precious was that this \\"ugly as black grease\\" and ignoraant obese bear was literally transformed in my eyes to real and authentic womanly beauty. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and is a manifestation of the spirit.  She loved her children, even though they were children concieved in incest and brutal abuse.  I actually saw her as chocolate gorgeous and mona lisa lovely in the scene where she breast fed her newborn. I thought it was also beautiful when she claimed her first child, even though she was mongoloid, and concieved in incest.  Her mother taunted her with; \\"I should have aborted you\\" I'll bet there are many children taunted with that horrible statement; illustrating the horendous social, spiritual and pychological effects  of  abortion on womanly culture. But Precious didn't give up on herself, even if she had to fantasize her self worth. And she managed with a little help and encouragement to snatch a true essence of womanhood and beauty to radiate from within herself and run for her life.  Precious is a heroine who runs for all of us.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|five stars for the films Robocop 1 and Robocop 2 blu rays. yes, it's not improved quality on blu ray like we deserve, but it's still technically the best version of the films available. Robocop 3 doesn't exist, so no comment there. My main reason for posting this though is, where are the extra's???? I loved the deleted scenes on the first Robocop, but what about Robocop 2? I've seen pictures of deleted scenes when Robocop goes to the cematary, so why in God's name do we not have these scenes on the Blu Ray ?
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Cant say much but that it does what it suppose to do. Gives me an extra oomph in bass and volume. Considering the price and the size its quite awesome. Great colour lights, volume control and bass boost helps. One thing though is that all rechargeable batteries one day die eventualy but hey nothing lasts forever right ?!!
0762439009|5.0|Great product. Bought it for a friend who loves the movie and he is very happy with it. I love the rug mouse pad that ties the room together.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Good movie, entertaining. The look of the movie is impressive. Not a deep drama but what do you expect in a fantasy movie.
B004XANKVO|4.0|This Thule backpack screams quality.  They truly thought of everything.  The exterior is tough and attractive.  The zippers are high quality, with large zipper pulls for grabbing.  There are compartments and pockets everywhere, and they are well thought out.<br /><br />My husband has a 17 inch laptop that is not a Macbook Pro.  It fits in the laptop compartment, but not in the specially designed elevated pocket.  That's quite all right.  There's also some lined pockets in that compartment for an iPad or phones and other devices with screens.  The lining is soft, so no worries about scratching the screen.<br /><br />Some other functional features:<br /><br />+ There is another compartment large enough for a change of clothing or books.<br />+ There is a stuff pocket with straps to adjust the size.  I think this is very handy for just throwing supplies in without the need to unzip.  Newspapers fit well there.<br />+ There is a hard protective case that is easily opened on the back.  This is good for things that might easily be crushed, like eyeglasses.<br />+ Add to all that: one smaller compartment on the back, two nice and deep side pockets,  and a place just for power supplies and cables.<br />+ The backpack straps are easily adjustable.  The chest straps has some elastic for comfort and it can be moved up and down.<br /><br />My only problem with the design is having the laptop in the compartment closest to my back is uncomfortable.  It keeps the backpack from hugging my back and I get a stiff board there.  It would have been more comfortable to have it farther from my back or maybe the mega padding like one backpack I have from the Swiss brand line.  Of course, the Macbook Pro is a little smaller than my husband's 17 inch laptop, so maybe it doesn't feel as bad with the Macbook Pro inside.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice backpack.  Although designed for a laptop, it can be used for many other things.  Carrying a large laptop in it can be uncomfortable.  Smaller laptops and netbooks should be fine.
1423389387|5.0|When I got this Audio Book to review, I realized it was actually the second novel in the series, as a die hard sci-fi/fantasy reader, I couldn't just jump into the series like that. So I ordered the first set of audio cds as well and am very glad I did as I really enjoy the reading by Nick Podehl. His voice and range of characters fit the story very well.  I enjoyed his reading enough that I am likely to look for other books read by him just to see if I enjoy them as much.    As a long time reader of this genre, there are very few plots that I find unique, so for me to really enjoy (and give 5 stars to a book) there must be something different about it.  The approach that this book uses, as sort of biography, along with the richness of the characters and writing are just that extras that I look for to make a book more enjoyable.  There are other stories that I have read that have similar themes and story elements, but I don't feel they have been put together in quite the same way and that makes the experience of listening to (and likely reading) this story well worth the time.      I look forward to the next book in the series. I hope the wait is not as long for the next book as it was for this one.  Though if that extra time is what it took to put out a book of such quality, the wait will be worth it.
B004VQFQ2Q|2.0|Overall, horrible sound quality just like several other Black Sabbath deluxe versions including Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules. All sound like muffled crap and not worth the money! If you want the best possible version of Born Again on CD, at this time, try and find the 1996 Castle Remastered series version! This Born Again Deluxe Remaster is a true Zero The Hero!
1439153663|5.0|A riveting story about the South during the days of slavery.  It depicted the difference between the slaves who served the plantation owner and the ones who worked in the fields and the way both sets of slaves were treated.
B004NIFSRA|1.0|It pains me to think that anyone with any sort of brain, sex on it or otherwise, would pay any money to purchase this \\"book.\\" It is a waste of paper. I understand, some of you are crying, \\"but its a great conversation starter!\\" Well, so is pulling your c*ck out at a party. But you don't see people doing it, right? (Well, maybe...) But that's my point. Why would any kind of person spend 10-15 dollars on a BLANK book for a conversation piece? I'll stick with my own witty personality to break the ice, thanks.   Oh, and the kindle version was an even bigger waste of time.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Really? This album has a 4.8 average score from the nearly 200 reviewers. I decided to pick this up, since I'm barely getting into my prog rock phase right now, and I have to say that Jethro Tull surely put out an amazing masterpiece. Such technicality, precision, lunacy, flamboyance, self-indulgence (things that define prog rock)... It's not wonder why 90% of these reviews have given the album such high praise and why prog rock websites call this one of the prog rock masterpieces of the 1970s.<br /><br />If you're getting into prog rock, this album/song is a must. A prog rock collection is incomplete without this. And if you're not into prog rock, I still think that this album deserves a listening.<br /><br />Can't say anything else that anyone here hasn't already said. Good album. Does a lot, and it does it very well. No... it does it unbelievably well.
030746363X|5.0|Book is very in depth about weight loss, throwing out the window all the old cliches.  Is much bigger than I thought it would be for the price.  Very happy with my purchase and the speed of delivery.
B0012EF0WQ|5.0|I was recently discharged from the Navy it was 1970. I was taking a trip thru the southland. One day my girl and I were walking thru the old town section of St Augustine, which is kinda like a Spanish style Williamsburg. I heard this music wafting thru the narrow streets. It was coming from an incense clouded head shop.(we were both a little...you know) It was the beginning..\\"what are their names\\". I asked the guy \\"what is that music?\\" I lost all of my stuff albuns etc back in the 80s when I had to vacate my apt in a hurry.haha. EVERYTHING. I re found this album and have it on my iphones etc now. All I have to do is play this music and it has the ability to transport me thru time and space. I am 20 yrs old again, I smell patchouli, weed, and I am walking lazily thru the ancient streets of ST Augustine circa 1600s. Magical stuff. Very few albums can do this. I really cant think of any that come close to it. IT is like an opiate of sound.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This controller is amazing. Everything i expected and more.<br /><br />It has the look and feel of an xbox controller plus more. Its rubbery feel and grip add that extra something to it that gamers need.<br /><br />If you are looking to step up your gaming experience in highly recommend this controller and investing in it. Superb.
0007179731|5.0|Its one of my collection. Just love it, a great guru and mantra to lead a more balance and meaningful life.  It helped me recover through a tough time in my life and move on in a more balanced way.  I do recommend this for people who appreciate the thought that life has more to offer than just what is external and visible.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|Yes, this album is very 'synthesized' in nature compared to his previous albums. There is not as much instrumental music but as I have listened to the album more and more I have grown to enjoy it more and more. I highly recommend it to any Yanni fan and forewarn them to keep an open mind.
B004WESFZW|5.0|\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas - a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself - the men of The Adjustment Bureau - who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path... or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her.    The cast led by Matt Damon (as David) & Emily Blunt (as Elise) is great. The directing and screenplay (based on the short story \\"Adjustment Team\\" by Philip K. Dick) by George Nolfi (who also produced) is great.    The music by Thomas Newman is great. The cinematography by John Toll is great. The film editing by Jay Rabinowitz is great. The casting by Amanda Mackey & Cathy Sandrich Gelfond is great. The production design by Kevin Thompson is great. The art direction by Stephen H. Carter is great. The set decoration by Susan Bode Tyson is great. The costume design by Kasia Walicka-Maimone is great.    This is an excellent movie that keeps you thinking, your heart racing while being on the edge of your seat, entertained. This is a mind-opening film that is well-made and well-crafted. This is one of the best movies of the year, so far.
0743270754|5.0|This really is three books in one. It's a description of the make up of Lincoln's cabinet, it's a biographical depiction of Lincoln himself, and it's a narrative about the civil war. Incredibly well written, this book takes you from Lincoln's youth through his assassination and beyond.<br />Goodwin does a great job painting the different characters that made up the cabinet. Each of the cabinet members is described with just enough detail for the reader to get a sense of what made them tick and why they were a complement to the cabinet puzzle Lincoln put together. Besides Lincoln, Seward, Chase and Stanton were described in great detail. Those relationships were really the center piece of the cabinet machinations and deserved Goodwin's attention.<br /><br />While she pays much attention to the other individuals, the book's core is Lincoln. His magnanimous, honest, sincere character is detailed through out the book. At times you wonder if a man can really be that great. The books satisfies this question with a simple answer - yes.
030746363X|2.0|This book was simply an overall dissapointment.    Now, I found his premise very interesting; like he challenged the norms of corporate America, he would challenge the world of anatomy and physiology.    I'll keep this truncated. Very interesting and entertaining to read, but I didn't get that much out of it that I could apply:    - The slow carb diet is basically atkins.  - His muscle building concepts had very different programs and nothing concise or seeming like there's a program to it. Though, I'll consider kettlebell swings next time I need some good cardio.  - Did, in fact try applying his Geek 2 Freak program, and in turn gained 5 lbs in 4 weeks. Yes, I had SOME success, and I do agree with the concept of using High Intensity Training, first introduced by Arthur Jones, but the problem was that Ferris dove into long dead experiments that could not be easily replicated, like the Colorado Experiment featuring Casey Viator. I've found the most success using HIT by following a protocol designed by 4X Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates. Considering Yates has the most credibility out of all of Jones' HIT disciples (Viator never won the Olympia, and Mentzer only won once), you would think Ferris would dig more into his exploits for research.  - Overall, however, the muscle building tips are a huge letdown. While I did gain 5 lbs, only half of it was lean muscle. That's 2.5 lbs muscle, and 2.5 lbs fat. The problem, in retrospect was that the frequency WAS, as I suspected, too little. 2 total body workouts per week, sometimes one, is not enough to stimulate growth, except for super skinny begginers, and I've been lifting for nearly 10 years.  - The whole sex section REALLY felt out of place from the rest of the book. For a person who advocated hunting niche markets in 4 Hour Workweek, it seemed like he tried broadening his market for THIS book. Either that, or he didn't specify what his exact market is. Because of the sex section, as well as many of the other sections in this book, I think the demographic targeted was the 'Men's Health' audience. Women might even find this book offensive.  - The section about sleep is the prime example of the many parts of this book not applicable for a normal class person. many chapters in this book require very close supervision of scientists and specialists, or just a lot of time you may not have to spare. I don't see myself using 2 weeks of vacation time just to fight my sleep rythims.  - The strength chapters seemed the most useful and practical overall. Mainly powerlifting protocols, they're far easier to replicate than anything else in the book.  - the chapters on the NFL combine are interesting reads, yet not very easy to replicate without the close supervision of a speed and athletic coach. It's the equivalent of learning to play piano by reading a book. Not easily done.    I'm sure there was more chapters, but this review isn't as truncated as I initially set out to write. Overall impression: interesting to read, not easy (nearly impossible in some situations) to apply. Being part of this book's demographic, I found the book entertaining, but I can easily see (by the book alone, much less some of the past reviews) how this book can be terribly offensive.
B003R0MEZ4|3.0|First of all, I love this show. I've never missed an episode and re-watch all five previous seasons on a regular basis. That being said, season 6 was a bit lackluster. This is due to the major casting changes that took place during the summer. Both AJ Cook and Paget Brewster's contracts were cut, and during season 6 both were written off the show. While the writing in those episodes were top notch, the rest of the season left a bitter taste in your mouth. After episode 2 (appropriately titled JJ), JJ's absense left a gaping hole in the fabric of the BAU. It was almost as if the heart of the show had been ripped away, leaving writers, cast and fans scrambling. Just when we began to settle into the new JJ-less reality, in comes Agent Seaver, played by Rachel Nichols. This was a horrific decision. This is nothing against Ms. Nichols, who did the best she could with what she was given. However, fan response was not positive, as Ms. Nichols bears a striking resemblance to AJ Cook, who we had just lost. Also, the writers and producers truly did Ms Nichols little justice with weak storylines and weaker impact to the team dynamic. Finally, Prentiss' \\"death\\" was long and drawn out. It was compelling to watch, but it was with a sense of dread, knowing that she, too, was about to leave us. \\"Lauren\\" (the episode where Prentiss left) was the highlight of the season. It was full of drama, angst and action- a fitting tribute to an actress who had entertained us all for years. Finally, the finale was just simply \\"eh\\". There was a decent case, but none of the cliffhanger endings that CM is known for. This could be in part that at the time of filming, producers and writers were not sure who would be returning, as Paget Brewster was in negotiations to come back, as was Shemar Moore (Morgan), and Thomas Gibson (Hotch). As of June 22, all three will be returning, as will AJ Cook, who returned briefly in the finale. Here's to hoping that with the cast back intact, Season 7 will be the kind of quality show we have come to expect.
0802473156|5.0|LOVE this book. I highly recommend it - whether or not you're in a relationship. EVERYONE can find something useful/helpful with this book. I've purchased it as gifts for couples and friends and they all love. Excellent book.
B000SEVVLK|5.0|Please don't be fooled by these other reviews. This book is smart, funny, and an excellent addition to the chic-lit genre. Please take my word for it or better yet give it a go. I swear you'll be hooked on chapter one. Don't dismiss this gem!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|While I am not a science fiction or fantasy reader this book struck me and will probably stay with me for quite awhile.  Unlike any book I have read it truly is a cross between X-Men and Narnia - I would highly recommend to anyone.  The photos give the story even more plausibility!  While at times \\"scary\\" the way it is written did not disturb my dreams in the least (and I am a whimp).  Take a chance on this book, it is well worth it!
1416550550|5.0|I am so happy that I've discovered Kate Morton, and I can't wait to read her other books!  I just finished this one, and I didn't want it to end.  It is one of my top ten favorites of all time!
0060594896|5.0|As a child I read various Chicken Soup for the Soul books and when I saw this book by Jack Canfield I had to buy it immediately.  I came across this book at a difficult time in my life after I lost my best friend of 24 years to a sudden illness.  I felt like my life had fallen apart in the year that followed and this book came at the perfect time and gave me hope again.<br /><br />I love that this book addresses many areas of life:<br />Relationships<br />Money<br />Success<br />Self Esteem<br />Building A Success Team<br /><br />He gives powerful tools and exercises to implement real change whether you are struggling with money or self esteem, this book is a true gem!
0670022411|3.0|enjoyed the book and the history of witches and vampires BUT....  after 579 pages, it left me hanging.  got all worked up for a war or something and it didn't happen.    do hope you are going to write a second book to take over where you left off.  want to know if Sarah and Yasbeau get along or will that be war as well.  and what happens when Diana gets her hands on the original Ashmole 782.  agree with all that was written about this book.  the good and bad things said.  so please get to working on the second book.  thanks
0060763280|5.0|I read this book years ago and reread it earlier this year.  This book focuses on an important overlooked component of a wealthy mindset.  Harv makes the point that while two people can have the same education and information and one will become successful while the other does not.  What makes the biggest difference is the MINDSET.<br /><br />He gives you declarations to create \\"wealth files\\" in your mind as well as contrasts \\"poor\\" ways of thinking vs. \\"rich\\" ways of thinking.<br />We often have self defeating thoughts and habits and this book addresses those issues with wonderful anecdotes.  Harv has walked the walk. Not only is he a self made millionaire, but he has also taught others to do the same through his books and courses.<br /><br />He includes a free ticket to The Millionaire Mind Intensive weekend in the book which I was able to attend in February.  It was well worth the time.  I highly recommend this book and the course to anyone who would like to create a wealthy mindset to create a wealthy life (and as you'l learn in this book, true wealth involves more than just money).
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout, and very challenging. The 18-minute format is very convenient. One warning - I did it every day, advancing to the more difficult levels after a reasonable amount of time and doing all of the warmup and cool down (plus more of my own) and I still ended up with a pulled hamstring. It's been almost 12 weeks now and I'm still not totally healed. I don't want to spend the money and time on physical therapy, which is why it's been a slow heal, but the massage therapist I've seen who has been a big help said my quads got too strong and too tight and caused my hamstring muscles to get really overstretched. And looking back, this workout (as well as Jillian's cardio workout) put almost all the emphasis on the quad muscles, which is why I wouldn't do it every day but work it in 1-2 times a week.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I think the creators of this series really accomplished the impossible by not only converting George R.R. Martin's epic novel into a series but making it so damn good in the process.  In some ways, the characters shine better on the screen than on the page.  Tyrion is a prime example.  He's an excellent character in the books, but Peter Dinklage and the script writers somehow manage to improve upon an already solid foundation.  Most critics seem to heap the most acting praise upon Dinklage, but the entire cast is great.  The story is taken seriously and it shows.  This is not some campy swords-and-sorcery fantasy.  You should come into the series expecting loads of blood, nudity, and sex.  Do I have any complaints?  Yes, a few, but that aren't the sorts of things that would turn this into anything less than a five-star review.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I got an iPhone 4 (Verizon) just before being given the opportunity to review this case. If I had got the case first, I probably would have got the white iPhone. (-: I have another black case that the phone can fall out of. I also have a black juice pack so I  want to sometimes take off the case. So for that reason, I like this case. It doesn't offer as much protection as I would like, but it is easy to take it off and the phone does not fall out of it. I like the back design. The openings on the bumper for the controls are all sized nicely, but since they are openings, there is less protection. The slim size is great and it doesn't hide the iPhone. Since I do take the case off sometimes, I didn't want to use the front protection screen. I have used one on an iPod Touch and it has lasted for years.
B004XE0P5E|3.0|I really COULD NOT WAIT to hear this album.  Since For Emma, Forever Ago + Blood Bank Ep I have been nothing short of OBSESSED with Bon Iver.  I've must have listened to both releases like a dogma and bought both several times to gift to friends who claimed there is,\\"no good modern folk.\\"  Not to mention I've been endlessly reading interviews  he has given on the anticipation of this album.  I waited around my local music store until midnight to pick this up(only one there too!).  I raced home to listen to this record in a proper audio system; I wanted to enjoy this album intimately alone in my room rather than on my ride home on an inadequate system.  I get to my house, put into my player, grab my headphones and put them on.  I sit myself put my hands together then reach my right hand out to adjust the volume.  Then savoring the moment slowly moving my index finger to the play button to start what I have with in every inch of me have been restraining to hear on my way home.<br /><br />The lofty notion of this being a Folk Epic was quickly dispelled after listening to the record. The results end up being perplexing(although alluring) instead of being sweeping and intimate, the latter I was expecting.  I can understand Vernon's sentiment that he wants to extend outside the quiet cabin folk he explored on his last effort.  On here though it kind of feels like Vernon is trying to slam the door on his past while trying to please his fans.  It's an odd balance he tries to achieve, but ends up being driven into the ground.  Which is surprising considering the professionalism he was able to display previously.<br /><br />On this outing there are quite a bit of guest musicians filling up the majority of the tracks.  There is nothing wrong with that when you know how to arrange them to play off each other correctly.  Instead of that, they seem to be competing for space to stand out, even Vernon's vocals seem to be muted at times.  The starting track, \\"Perth,\\" is a perfect example of this;  The martial-like drums that come in and out making the vocals sound like there trying to cut through the wall of sound.  This problem arises quite a few times with different instruments throughout the record.  So even though it tries to come off with a sweeping folk epic feel (like Sufjan Steven's Illinoise or Badly Drawn Boy's The Hour of Bewilderbeast) it ends up sounding like a world music record from all the oddly picked and organized instruments.<br /><br />That isn't to say there aren't good moments to be found here: There are.  \\"Holocene,\\" \\"Towers,\\" and,\\"Michicant\\" all have a very warm intimate feel that Bon Iver was always an impeccable expert at.  Although these tracks do have a little bit of the distracting instrumentation afformentioned, I couldn't help but smile with a warm glee.  The mood slowly dissipates when, \\"Hinnom, TX,\\" arrives with the way too cheesy synths (\\"He's going chillwave\\").  They would work of course if they were planted with a little more subtle care.  Yes this is meant to be an epic, but that doesn't mean every instrument needs to be in the limelight to be effective.  An epic has it's quite moments too.<br /><br />The ending though is probably one of the most confusing musical instances I've listened to this year.  \\"Beth/Rest,\\" the weirdest arranged of all with the guitar and sax solos that are supposed to play off each other to create a feeling of a warm closure end up sounding like something from a cheesy 80's movie.  It's kind of like the Mountain Goats song \\"Song for Tura Santana\\", but rather than being warm, quirky, and mysterious it's downright weird.  Down to it's production and it's dated instrumentation(again way too cheesy synths).<br /><br />The album ends up being half-baked overkill instead of a mysterious epic that Vernon was shooting for.  I thought Vernon at this point could do no wrong especially with the maturity on display in the last album; a good artist/songwriter doesn't make for a good producer.It would be cruel to suggest that Iver should have made a Pt.2 for For Emma seeing as Vernon wants to set himself apart from it.  Bon Iver is a noble and honest attempt at expanding his sonic palette, but ultimately falls prey to it's detractors too much to make a long lasting impression.<br /><br />Even then, seeing myself as a huge fan, it has a small element of allure to keep me playing it; I'm glad I bought it.  The album as overblown as it is, is still recommended by me, but only to the most loyal listeners.<br />In short, it's worth a listen for the casual listener, but not an entry into benchmark folk albums.should have made a Pt.2 for For Emma seeing as Vernon wants to set himself apart from it.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|Very well put together; unlike the last 2 episodes of the series, which i would recommend never to watch unless you like taking a few Advil after, I was actually mad after the seeing the last 2 episodes which were aired just to finish the series, thanks to some corporate man finding some content controversial. this has a much clearer plot that still gives you a curve ball every once in a while. This definitely is in my favorite anime movie that I've had the pleasure of seeing. I would recommend it whether renting it or buying it it's well worth it.

B00503BN1M|4.0|It may be a lot of cliche and predictability, but so what...  it was still a cute movie and totally hit the spot.  Good job to all the actors and other folks because it was fun.
B003ZHR6SY|4.0|I purchased Toy Story 3 (Spanish Edition) to show it to my students who are learning Spanish.  The DVD is set up so that there is an English or Spanish choice at the beginning.  When you select Spanish, everything (including the menu) is written and spoken in Spanish.  It was difficult to find the English subtitles, but otherwise it was excellent quality and the students enjoyed watching the familiar movie in Spanish.<br />The quality of the DVD itself was pretty standard.  The dubbing was well done too.  Usually the actors' voices for dubbed movies are not particularly well done, but they seemed to have put in more of an effort on this particular movie.<br />Toy Story 3 as a movie itself is excellent and that holds up to the quality of the other two.<br />If you're interested in watching a movie with both Spanish and English options, this is the one for you!
B0055EAJ7A|1.0|I regretted paying even the discounted ticket price to see this movie. It disappointed me in every aspect. The action was weak and nearly non-existent. The acting was garbage. The settings were stupid. Asgard? As if. Anyone who worships the elder gods and all-father Odin, as I do, would be ashamed and disgraced by this weak display of film making.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Thanks John for sharing this information for all of us wannabes. You've tapped into my main concept for my first book--it is ok to be good enough if good enough works. You just can't suck. I smiled when I read that. You've given me great ideas to move forward and have inspired. Those reading this should understand that what worked for John may not work for us all, but his concepts presented are sound and make logical sense. I too wasted money promoting my first book. I should have done some of these things instead.<br /><br />Another thing readers should remember is that John is way smarter than many of us. He was a successful sales and marketing professional first, then he started writing books. What do you do when you come across someone who knows more than you about a topic. You soak up their knowledge like a sponge and move on. He didn't have to put out this info, but he did. It will help us writers and he'll make some bucks as well. Win win.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Seen this movie on Netflix and I wanted to have a copy for myself. Never knew what a worm ring  was until I watched this movie. Cant walk away from watching this movie ... kinda wakes u up too. Makes you wonder!!! Glad I got it
B001JAFYFG|5.0|The movie is a classic and needs no review, so I'll review the Blu-Ray portion of this purchase.  Not much effort was put into restoring this classic.  I'm glad to have it on Blu-Ray, but this is a dirty print.  It's scratchy and grainy, but you get what you pay for.  I would have paid more for it if it was a full restoration, but at least I have it.    The Blu-Ray version is so revealing that the DVD version almost looks cleaner because it can't reveal all this grain.  Sound i nothing special either.  Again, it's acceptable, but only for the cheap price on Amazon.
B002YVAT72|4.0|Easy, Easy.  Software downloaded flawlessly, and turntable hooked up with laptop or desktop, no problems.  Took some old albums that were given to me and digitized them.  For the price, you can't beat it.  It was delivered ahead of time but the cover was cracked.  I did not mind the crack as it did not interfere with the performance of the turntable.  Great value.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I laughed out loud, I had tears at times.  I loved this book.  I\\"m a NR fan but something about this book just got to me.  I think it's absolutely one of her best.

0307272702|5.0|After years of living on a low fat vegetarian whole grain 'healthy' diet,  I weighed in at over 200 pounds.  I applied the research that is presented in this book and lost 30 pounds in a few months.  I feel great.  I have more energy than I have had in years. My 'numbers' are great.  I will continue following a diet supported by  the research presented in this book instead of what the medical establishment prescribes - on which I was always hungry and gained weight. It is sad that the medical system in this country is so blind.  Dr Oz on his TV show (that I will never watch again)  asked why we should believe Gary Taubs   stating that he (Gary) is not a doctor.   That is the exact reason why we SHOULD believe him. He shows the  research about weight loss - what works and what does not. He leaves out the political and biased views and weightloss strategies promoted by big agribusiness and the pharmaceutical companies. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to be healthier and lose weight, and who is interested in the science behind why we get fat.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|easy at first, becomes increasingly difficult.  good for passing time.  the quick play is fun, i enjoyed getting the achievements.
0740785508|5.0|This book is exactly what I had been looking for!  Author doesn't just tell you how to do it his way; he helps the reader to find their own way.  I love this book, and have been sharing it with friends, who have vowed to get their own copy of the book!  Excellent book for creative people who have been frustrated by not being able to produce what is inside them.

0312323867|4.0|The only thing I really didn't like about this book was the really unrealistic transformation that Darcy goes through. A complete personality overhaul--only with Darcy it seems more like a lobotomy. In the first book, Something Borrowed, she is callous and brash, even at one point telling her \\"best friend\\" Rachel that she wasn't going to do much better than some guy that Rachel didn't have any feelings for. Telling someone they're not good enough for options squarely lands you not just in the category of a bad friend, but a bad person. Her personality flaws ran deep and were shocking. Not only does she move to the most expensive city in the world (London is actually proven to be the most expensive, even down to parking, no joke) and spends nearly every penny she has on designer clothes even though she's pregnant, despite the fact that she doesn't realize she needs not only a work visa, but connections just like anywhere else, especially during a recession (apparently she didn't realize that recession isn't only relegated to America). Not to mention the fact that she cheated on her fiance (Dex) and then acted as if she was the only one that mattered in the situation when she found out that he was doing the same to her.<br /><br />I think Darcy's literal overnight transformation belongs in the magical kingdom variety of storytelling, not in a novel about real people, but it's a good story and I end up liking the ending. I kind of saw the ending coming, but actually reading it was like a breath of fresh air, for both Darcy and Rachel. I read a review before reading this book and someone said something about Rachel still being a pushover for Darcy, but I didn't see it that way. I just saw Rachel as \\"nice\\" in this book and I was glad that she'd gotten what she believed she wanted and needed at the end of Something Borrowed. Which was obviously something true at the end of Something Blue. I didn't like Rachel though. She was just too spineless. And Darcy's transformation was just too far fetched. She went from a completely self-centered a-hole to a giving, wonderful wife and mother at the end. I want to see someone change so intrinsically in their lives just because someone makes a list for them and says \\"here's what you do wrong as a person\\" and it forever changes their entire personality. Gnomes and fairies are more believable.<br /><br />But it is a page turner. And lighthearted. And a good ending for chick lit standards.too far fetched.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|I recently lost this movie. I wanted to watch it so often that I had to buy another copy. That is how much I Love this movie. I was willing to pay for it twice and not feel cheated at all.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This was one of those shows I didn't really intend to see, but it was on at a family party.  The kids loved it.  My husband and I don't buy very many dvds but this one hit the must-buy list for all of us.  It was hilarious.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0805047905|5.0|My grandson is to begin kindergarten and this book was on the list of reading for the summer. He loves this book and we read it over and over again.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins knows how to write a gripping story.   Buy all three of this series together so you won't have to wait between books.  This final book in the series wraps it all up.  There are no loose ends.  The plot continues to move in a quick pace with a lot of surprises.  Collins has it all well thought out and keeps you in her grip until the end page.  An excellent story, original in content.  You won't forget this story and its wonderful characters.  The story will haunt you long after you finish reading the last chapter.  It is an intelligent, well devised plot with believeable well drawn characters.  It is aimed for young adult audiences. As an adult, I was fascinated with it. It ranks with the best of the epics.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My daughter bought this for her son and I thought I had lost it so I repurchased it to replace the lost copy. Months later I found the original and thought I would give the new one to someone else but we are hanging on to it. My grandson loves this movie.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an artist.  She is truly a wordsmith.  I always want an author to be smarter than I am.  Ms. Collins is definitely smarter than most everyone.  The plot is complicated, but easy to follow.  The plot is timely in regards to current sociological events.  Without seeming too, the plot has you thinking about our society's choices and the place government holds in our every day lives.  The character development is well done.  You know these people.  You have met them.  This story is believable.  The story is violent, but not gratuitously so.  Once you pick it up, I hope you have undisturbed time so you can read as you will not want to put it down until you are done.
1599218011|5.0|I was on a Christian Yoga website and it recommended I read this book. I thought I was very informed when it comes to health, but I have to say this was a great read.
B003L77GRO|5.0|To those of you who read these reviews to find out if this product is worth your money and time... let's just say it's one of the best investments you will ever come across. Must see series of our generation, honestly.
0805017593|3.0|My grandson is scheduled to go to kindergarten next fall. The teacher gave us a list of books to read thru the summer for him to get used to \\"reading\\" actually memorizing words. This book was on the list. It was okay but he really likes Brown Bear, Brown Bear What do You See? best and so do I. My girlfriend said the next book I should purchase in the same series is the Ladybug. She said it is a fun read.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This review is based on the fact that I have only watch the first three episodes.  Main character is likable and believable.  The story, so far, has kept my interest.  The zombies act like half the people driving on the freeways -- like they have no brains.  The sets and makeup are good and the supporting undead cast works well together.  Not sure how they are going to keep the story line going, but its good enough to make me happy I bought the DVD and am looking forward to seeing the remainder of the first season.
B004YJZ5GM|5.0|One of my favorite bands has released one of my favorite records and I'm thrilled with what I'm hearing again after so many years.  I believe Grateful Dead's, \\"Blues For Allah\\" is available on CD, but I wanted a complete reminisce and that meant to experience the 12\\" vinyl ritual - seated on the floor, dropping the needle on the record, turning over the record and not just reading the lyrics, but \\"snuggling\\" with the record jacket.   This re-mastered version is a gigantic step-up from my totally worn original copy for not only is it a 180g vinyl  pressing it is contained in a beautiful gatefold jacket (this is my second favorite Dead album cover and it deserves to be viewed in all twelve inches). I long ago lost the original lyric sheet that was included with the old album, but this copy has all the lyrics written on both sides of the inside jacket.  Well, all that is just the frosting on the cake for the real treat is the quality of the sound of the record.  I'm hearing things I never heard before in the sound of the vocals and the band's performances. This is a studio album and the new remaster has brought-out the richness of every instrument. I think I've just officially transitioned from record collector to audiophile. This is the way I want to hear recorded music henceforth - I never knew what I was missing.  The company that put out this record has a web site I visited and their catalog lists so many of the classic records and artists I love, so it's fair to say Audio Fidelity has a new customer for life. I'm certain I'll begin my spending spree on \\"Shakedown Street,\\" another Dead album they released...let me see how quickly Amazon can get this in my grateful hands (and arms).  Five stars for the recording, the package and the entire listening experience (as well as the little medieval Dead musician colorfully pictured on \\"The Other Side\\").
0062060554|5.0|I ordered this book on a whim because I like mysteries, drama and surprises.  The title beckoned me to find out what happens \\"before I go to sleep\\".  I haven't quite finished it yet, but it is a real page turner.  Hard to tell who is good and who is bad.  Dr. Nash?  Ben?  Christine?  The words \\"Don't trust Ben\\"--where did they come from, why were they on first page of journal?    I have to keep reading till I find out.  Wish I hadn't had to come to work today!

B004GUSG4M|5.0|I bought this book on Thursday, 16 June because it seemed interesting. I finished it yesterday, though it would have been much earlier, had I had my way. I was HOOKED. I could not put it down. From wanting to figure out why things were happening to seeing if she had remembered a memory before, this book was perfect. I very much enjoyed it and had no idea about the twists coming at the end. I would highly recommend this book. I am even planning to go back and re-read it, just so I can see what I may have missed now that I am in the \\"know\\".
0385342039|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's female protagonists, who are the narrators in all her books, have similar characteristics - bubbly, a bit crazy, but all of them have a good heart.  The novel's story line and general feel may be viewed as the same as her other works  - girl in a dire situation in her job and love life, concerned parents, \\"nasty' relatives - but the one thing that's different is quite welcome:  a dead great grandaunt's hovering spirit.  It may be predictable, but it was entertaining just the same, and not to forget - heartwarming.  It may be chick-lit, but it's chick-lit with a heart.
0393338827|5.0|This is the first Michael Lewis book I have read and was delighted with \\"The Big Short.\\"  This non-fiction narrative of the major players in the subprime mortgage industry - which ultimately lead to the most significant economic recession since 1929 - was fast-paced, interesting, well researched, and very entertaining.  Mr. Lewis effortlessly guides the lay-reader (me) through the highly complex world of financial instruments (think \\"Collateralized Debt Obligations,\\" or \\"Credit Default Swamps\\") that very few people on Wall Street really understood during the economic boom.  His first hand accounts of Michael Burry, Greg Lippman, and others, provide a colorful (and sobering) backdrop to how our financial system nearly collapsed.    If you are looking for an informative anatomy of how a group of 10 - 20 individuals made billions off of the financial meltdown, \\"The Big Short\\" will not disappoint. This is the most interesting book I have read in 2011.
1400052181|5.0|This true story is fascinating.  It helped an unscientific reader like me understand the world of cell research going on during my lifetime.  More importantly, though, it is a study of human nature, with MANY persons in the \\"play.\\"  Very well written.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|I'm not the biggest Symphony X fan, although after this one, I'm going to go back and give their earlier stuff a more in depth listen.  I know a couple songs off each of their albums and like those songs, but this is the first one I've given it's proper listen, and part of that is based on how much I liked it on the first listen.    Thanks to Dream Theater, who I do like, and they're one of my all time favorite bands, I've developed a sort of stigma with songs over or approaching 10 minutes.  I just think, \\"Oh God another song that would work as a 6 minute song, but they're going to drag it out with a pointless jam session.  Well I can say that these guys should give the folks in Dream Theater a few lessons, because the title track, while approaching 11 minutes, doesn't feel like it.      My only 2 complainst are that the album, as a whole the 2 disc version, kind of drags, a very little, but not too much.  I don't know why they didn't just make this a double album, and not have a single disc version, because the single disc version keeps the 2 weekest, in my opinion, songs instead of beter ones.  Also the entire album will fit on 1 cd, except for 1 song, so it kind of feels like a bit of a rip off, in that sense.      But, overall it's a really good album, and with all the crap out there, this is definitely worth getting.  The production is solid.  The musicianship is excellent.  Someone mentioned the shifting in tempos, which I love.  Seriously I've had it with bands who have 1 fast tempo, most power metal bands in fact, and 1 slow tempo, and they just use those 2.  I'd have liked a little more cleaner vocals, but overall the melodies are good, and I do like this guy's rougher style.    If I get the urge to, and after I get to know the album a little better, I'll put a track by track listing up, but right now I don't know the songs well enough.    I do know it's my favorite album on 2011 already.      Oh, also the 2 disc version is a MUST.  Seriously, you'll be missing out on some really good songs if you don't get it.    Favorite songs so far; Iconoclast,The End Of Innocence, Children Of A Faceless God, Electric Messiah, and Light Up The Night, but as I get to know more songs, I'm sure I'll have more to add to that.    Also check out the new albums from , Hammerfall, Divinefire, Pagan's Mind, In Flames, and Stratovarius.  They're all pretty solid.    Oh and I'm only critical of Dream Theater, because I know they're still capable of being great.
B000V7O0GW|2.0|and neither did i. it was boring from begining to end. i think it was a good deal but is not an original so for that it shouded cost only 1 dollar
B0018S6YO4|4.0|Rihanna has come a long way from here S.O.S. pop days.  These songs are great and leave her as a force to be reckoned with.  I don't think there is one bad song on the album.  I actually purchased the original addition of this and found this one laying on my sidewalk and was thinking why would anyone toss this.  I love this version as Adam Levine is on it too.

B004SB60OC|5.0|For one, I love that she sings alto, which is the lower range of the female voice.  It makes it easy for me to sing along.<br />Most people are most familiar with Jar of Hearts.  Following that bare all lineage, she bares her soul on most of these songs.  All are fairly strong lyrically.  Songs flow and tell a story.  And the tone of the music is mainly constant.  No upbeat to a ballad kind of thing.  Most of the songs have surprisingly good base.<br />Well worth the money.
1932100660|3.0|Great book with lots of research but not for the average reader. It's more about the research and doesn't recommend how to change your lifestyle. But he does refer Dr. Esselstyne which you can buy that book to read to help with the change of your lifestyle.
B0046MVVOW|3.0|Thought I was going to love this because most of her music is mixed pop of some sort.  There are too many s-l-o-w songs on here for my liking. I did but the two disc set because there was more to offer.  I would move the up-beat songs to one album and call it good.<br />I would purchase on sale.
0061726826|4.0|The HarperCollins Children's Audio website plugs this book as \\"Romeo and Juliet meets 1984.\\" What a perfect description of this story in only five words.  Lauren Oliver's latest book definitely shows large glimpses of George Orwell's classic dystopia.  Clearly Oliver was familiar with Orwell's famous work before writing Delirium as evidenced by this saying from the book:    Liberty in acceptance  Peace in enclosure  Happiness in renunciation    which mimics Orwell's famous motto from 1984:  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery  Ignorance is Strength.    Since the popularity of The Hunger Games, the dystopian genre has been so over-saturated that, at first glance, this book might just get dismissed as just another author trying to cash in on a trend. However, what sustains this book and sets it apart from all the other dystopian novels is in the beauty of Oliver's simple, no-nonsense prose.  And yet, despite its simplicity, it is also lyrical and poetic. Even further to Oliver's credit is her ability to subtly  weave a developing and evolving protagonist through a suspenseful, page-turning plot.  Lena's character begins the novel having accepted the previously stated Orwell-esque mantra. However, as the story progresses, you slowly but surely see that lie begin to unravel as everything she thought she once believed comes crashing down around her.     In regards to the audio presentation, Sarah Drew did a phenomenal job at interpreting this story.  Her emotions were perfectly on point and they were so believable that I almost felt like SHE was feeling those emotions as she was reading the story.  When Lena cried, I could almost see the tears running down the narrator's face. I highly recommend the audiobook if you're a fan of listening to books, but, like me, get frustrated with indifferent, apathetic, or just plain ill-suited narrators.    Without revealing any spoilers, I will say that upon first reading, I was perplexed, almost angered by the ending.  But the second time around, I understood why the book had to end the way it did.  I would love to say more, but I don't want to give anything away.  All I can say is that if you're a fan of dystopia and you haven't read this book yet... what are you waiting for?
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Zac Brown has a way with words.  Colder Weather is such a heart breaker, it probably holds true for so many people.  There are still the up-beat songs, even one featuring Jimmy Buffet.  My favorite song on this album is Quiet your Mind.<br />It always seems whenever I listen to any of the ZBB music I wish I was on an island somewhere.  Which is odd that he is a country musician but I love it the way it is.

B0056BMK6K|2.0|i was disappointed. There were a couple of nuggets that were interesting, but this book is short  in page number and long in unnecessary content. It really is all about social media marketing and gaming the Kindle ranking system. Throw in some solid customer service tips (for working with your readers) and that's about it. I feel like 40% of the book wasn't necessary because he's telling you what a great system he has, if he just told us the principles and why they were valuable the book would be much shorter. I would recommend this book for $1, but not for $5. Then again, if you know nothing about social media marketing or how items get on the Kindle best seller list you'll probably learn a handful of things.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've had the G13 for a few months now and am thoroughly pleased with it. This is my first gamepad so I can't compare it to others.  Far as improvements and being VERY picky, next generation models could add some sort of adjustment to move the wrist away from the keys, but imagine that'll add to the cost.  It would have been nice if there was a way to copy the M1 to M2 or M3 settings, but that setup takes a few minutes at most.  I initially picked this up for moving in raids and pvp'ing, it's way more comfortable and have more options at your fingertips for extended gameplay. If you put more than 10hrs a week into gaming this pad is a must.    Already recommended this to several friends- great model from a great company.
076792603X|2.0|The story has the potential to be good, but in the end, Dan Brown's lack of skill as a writer makes this a disappointing read.
0307593495|4.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed this series. I couldn't wait for the next installment. The ending though was disappointing. Wallander is a different man at the end (naturally since a character has to change in some way) and a little less likable - life has done him in a bit and he's not too optimistic about the future. I though, thoroughly enjoy stories that are unrelentingly sad and get to the heart of real human suffering.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the historical aspects featuring the Cold War - it supported the plot well, even pushed it along.<br /><br />Henning Mankell is a fine writer, and well worth investing your time in his work.<br /><br />BTW, if you haven't seen the TV version of the series staring Kenneth Branagh, you've been saved. Stick with the books.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|What hasn't been said about this album? It's brilliant, beautiful, intensely emotionally evoking, fascinating to listen to, and it's played recorded and mixed masterfully. It deserves 5 stars without a doubt for about half of the tracks that just floor you, and any lesser tracks here would be incredible on any other album but fall short only in comparison on this album. If you liked For Emma, Forever Ago, chances are you'll like this--it's still wonderfully accessible and enjoyable. There's added production and many more layers of sound, but it's done so well that it blends to create a sound that perfectly evokes a feeling. It adds, not detracts--as it should.    What Justin Vernon has created here is an album which, from start to finish, uses an incredible variety of sounds and instruments and layers and styles all at once, but somehow manages to stay coherent  the entire time. At each point, the message is clear, the sound is clear, and it all works together. He's like a master chef who puts together twelve crazy ingredients in one dish, and you think \\"there's no way that would work together,\\" but then you taste it and it's the most amazing flavor you've ever experienced. This album is like a 10-course meal of that caliber; each track is a different flavor, but most of them (especially the first half of the album) are just really, really good.    Another thing I want to add is that the recording and mastering quality on this disc is superb. There was a moment when I realized just how good it was--in Perth (first track) toward the end, there's a section where distorted guitars are going on with organs layered on top, with drums in the background, and then all the sudden a trumpet slowly fades in, at once subtle and clear, and then builds to a chiming trumpet chorus, still layered on top of everything else. Creating this kind of sound is an art, and they've hit a masterpiece here. Just gorgeous.    I have to add--this record has been so overhyped that any opinion onit is bound to be met with discontent (I'm looking at you, \\"unhelpful\\" voters). Give it a listen and see for yourself, put the opinions of others out of your mind. This is one of the few follow-up albums I've heard where the artist did just that: ignored the hype and just went with it. All I ask is you give him the same respect.
B004L03B3S|5.0|The world of From Beginning to End resembles a fairy tale's:  a rich world, like a castle's, and therefore, in some ways, free for those who belong to it; a beautiful world and beautiful people, full of grace and gifts; a world in which nature and the elements, especially water, are part of what people take joy in almost as much as they do in one another;  and it is a world of step-siblings.  But unlike, say, the step sisters in Cinderella, or the dark fairy tale-like world of the step brothers in King Lear, the brothers are not rivals or cruel to one another.  They are, instead, lovers.  Though Francisco's father dies and the two boys' mother dies much too young as well, though death and even doubts momentarily intrude upon the boys' lives, most of this movie takes place in light.  Even many of the more dimly lit scenes, as of the brothers making love in bed or dancing, have a radiance, an inner light to them.         There is something of the spirit of Latin American magic realism to this film, more so, perhaps, than there may seem to be at first viewing.  When the brothers do make and declare their love, seemingly for the first time, after their mother's death, the moment is filmed in a way that is in no sense \\"naturalistic.\\"  It is carefully styled and artful.  The sensuality, the eroticism is thereby heightened and intensified.   Like much in magic realism, perhaps an overused term which I am borrowing for convenience's sake, the \\"magic\\" lies in the way its excesses, its transcendence of realism's commonsense, reveal a profounder real than realism, with its reliance on surfaces and materialism, can.  This is true of many other scenes in the movie that might look realistic at first,  though others, as when their mother joins her sons after her death as they swim or when the two brothers dance naked, bathed in a filtered amber light, clearly mean to expand the movie's world beyond naturalistic limits.  It is, after all, a film much about sight, about what Thomàssaw in his brother's eyes when the younger brother opened his own late, the shift from black and white to color mimicking in a way what the unseeing baby boy sees until his brother enters his world.  And what he sees, what color means, the movie says, is love, from beginning to the end.  In every sense, this is its vision, how it sees one with what it sees.       Perhaps it is the genius of some comedies to make seem possible a world otherwise believed to be impossible.  I mean those comedies which are free from irony and the critical, skeptical side of the comic spirit.   It is a comedy at its greatest in music, rare in words, in part because it is so audacious.  How can one imagine a world in which love begins at the beginning and ends only at the end, at death, if then?  Narrative demands drama and drama demands conflict.  But From Beginning to End mostly lacks it, save in the troubles that ensue when Thomàs leaves for Russian to train for the Olympics.         Before Thomàs goes, partly prodded by Francisco-a motif of love as self-surrender is introduced here-and before Francisco offers Thomàs a wedding ring (on the right hand rather than on the left, since this is another beginning as yet), Francisco reads from a book, largely in praise of men loving men, though it does speak, not kindly,  of women, too.   That passage predicts how Francisco will react to Thomàs's absence and their separation.  In a way, by reading it aloud, he is letting them both know.  It speaks of the love of male love but also of danger.  He goes out, he parties, he invites a woman he meets back to the brothers' home, he kisses her, too forcefully, in a way that hurts her some-not a passionate kiss, but a self-conscious one, it would seem.  (Perhaps it is a woman and not a man he would seduce precisely because a man would be too dangerous, too close to his own desires.)  But she sees the ring and stops their petting, obviously to Francisco's relief.  This episode is the realization ofthe occasional, but insistent talk about 'jealous' and 'jealousy' that Francisco usually initiates that is his serpent in the garden.  This is the \\"conflict\\" or threat, and Francisco must experience it, must make it overt, not just use its words.  Thomàs senses that.  It is his worry, too.  He knows, or fears, that the words Francisco has used may be becoming real.  And, yes, we do see some of that still lingering on his face in the last scene in the movie.  But he has just been listening, smiling broadly, to Francisco's reciting Shakespeare's \\"Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments,\\" in Portuguese of course, and then opens the door to find Francisco there, in Russia.  The last shot of all is Thomàs's smile, close to elation or, anyway, close enough to suggest that the love between them is the love of which Shakespeare's sonnet 116 speaks:  \\"an ever fixèd mark.\\"        The brothers' elation at that \\"fixèd mark\\" seems to me much the abiding spirit of this profound film.  Even their parents come to share in it, whatever doubts they may have had at first that their intimacy might become \\"sexualized.\\"  As has been noted elsewhere, when the two brothers are telling each other why they love each other, Thomàs, the film's \\"narrator\\" at times, says, \\"I love you because to understand our love they'd have to turn the world upside down.\\"  He's speaking of the double taboo, in many minds, of gay incest, of course.  But he's also at least intimating that their permanent love, one that endures throughout two lives for good, an intimacy so complete it is  incomprehensible, one they share throughout their lives, would also make others have to turn their world upside down.  What would the world be like if such love were real, more real than any of the stories of love told before, whether in fairy tales or novels or movies?  That is the deeper taboo no  \\"realism\\" could speak of it, depict, tell its story.  And even history, even art would seem to be over thecenturies against it.   A love so complete, both have claimed, must notoriously end in separation or death.  Realism dictates it cannot last.        What From Beginning to End dares to offer is the comedy of a permanent and complete love that breaks all the rules, that is, in effect, magical-that lives beyond the way the world is supposed to be.  The film understands the need for it to be tried, to be brought into question, and then restored.  This is, after all, the structure of comedy.  But this comedy, just as Thomàs says, requires those who affirm it to turn their world upside down, to erase their previous sense of love, founded in realism, say, and bring to it a new vision.  For From Beginning to End is in many ways a visionary film.  It may resemble fairy tales in many respects.  But it is not finally limited by their dictates and their archetypes.  It expands beyond them.  It is a movie in love with a vision of an enduring love that revisions the world.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|This is the best of the Fast and Furious movies in my opinion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning and never gets boring. Saw this in theaters and will definitely be buying it when it comes out! Make sure you keep watching until a couple minutes into the credits or you'll miss a very important part of the movie!
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Great movie.  I have never seen the original so I didn't quite know what to expect.  This movie blew my doors off.  Oustanding special effects and the visual enhancement of Blue Ray technology make this a must buy.  I have watched it three or four times since I purchased it and I never get tired of it.  There are some twists and irony in the plot that keep you glued to the movie. In a word, buy it.

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Paul McCartney was the last of the Beatles to release a solo album. Lennon had already released three \\"experimental\\" albums, Harrison had released two \\"experimental\\" albums, and even Ringo had released Sentimental Journey which was, for him, experimental. There was never any expectation that any of those albums would be taken seriously. McCartney was McCartney's \\"experimental\\" album, with McCartney playing every instrument, but it was actually taken very seriously. For several months, McCartney had been barraged with questions regarding whether or not the Beatles were breaking up. Despite the fact that John Lennon had actually left the band in the fall of 1969, the breakup was intended to be kept secret until after a new record deal could be signed. In addition, the other three Beatles had hired Allen Klein to manage the Beatles over the strenuous objections of McCartney. Hiring Klein was the first real decision the Beatles had ever made that wasn't unanimous. Fed up with the secrecy, hippocracy, and the in-fighting, McCartny announced the breakup of the Beatles in conjuction with the release of McCartney.<br /><br />Many critics slammed the announcement as a publicity stunt and many blamed McCartney for breaking up the Beatles. The result of all this craziness was very mixed, often openly biased, critical reviews of the album. The fact that it topped the American charts (and reached #2 in the UK) only added fuel to the fire for its emotional detractors.<br /><br />The album itself actually sounds like a nice winter evening with the family relaxing in front of the fireplace. \\"The Lovely Linda\\" is a beautiful little snippet devoted to his then new wife; \\"That Would Be Something\\" - a cool little hummable mini-existentialism; \\"Valentine Day\\" - a nice, laid-back instrumental rocker; \\"Every Night\\" - a classic McCartney ballad; \\"Hot as Sun/Glasses\\" - another light rocker; \\"Junk\\" - an existential love song; and \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" - a peppy light blues/love song. Overall, \\"Side 1\\" flows along beautifully with consistently great melodies, even if few major statements. \\"Oo You\\" is the hardest rocker on the album, more joyful than nasty; \\"Momma Miss America\\" - a great uptempo march with fine guitar and keyboard work (and my favorite album track other than MIA); \\"Teddy Boy\\" - ballad style story of a tough kid's relationship to his mother (a version was included on promotional copies of the Beatles' unreleased Get Back album and on the Anthology); \\"Singalong Junk\\" - an instrumental version of \\"Junk\\", possibly unnecessary, but maintains the album flow; \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" - a great ballad, comparable to some of the Beatles best; \\"Kreen-Akrore\\" - basically an unsensational drum solo with heavy breathing and odd sound effects, but almost redeemed by a nice ending guitar solo. \\"Side 2\\" is noticeably more uneven than the first side, but still has a nice overall flow and has \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".<br /><br />As for the second disc, it's pretty obvious why the three bonus tracks were never released before. They aren't very good. \\"Suicide\\", a sort of cabaret number, is decent, but disposable; \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" is an unnecessary instrumental version of \\"Oo You\\"; and \\"Women Kind\\" borders on anoying. The three live recordings are all exceptional, but, unfortunately, preclude the likelihood of that unique concert ever being released as an album. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is comparable to, but maybe not quite as good as, the hit live version. \\"Hot As Sun\\" comes off as more roudy, and perhaps more fun, than the album version. \\"Every Night\\" features a wonderful Laurence Juber guitar solo. And, if you need three versions of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" on a single album, the \\"One Hand Clapping\\" version is excellent. I'm not sure who's responsible for the oddly incongruent track sequencing of the bonus discs for this remastered series, but the live tracks are worthwhile on their own.<br /><br />The packaging is superb with lyrics, credits, and nice pics.<br /><br />Overall, avery enjoyable album and well worth the price of a single CD.price of a single CD.
0385333846|1.0|This is the first Vonnegut book I've read, and it could very well be the last.  The humor wasn't very effective for me, and in general the book irritated me.    Characters    The book is told from the perspective of the author of the book, and the book is well aware that it is a book.  The central character of the book is Billy Pilgrim, a man who lived through WW2 and the book tracks his life before and after the war.  The book also talks about several other characters that Billy meets throughout the book, none of the characters are terribly deep.    Setting    The book takes place during WW2 in Germany, on the alien planet Tralfamadore, where the aliens see all of time at once, it's weird sounding, and it's even weirder in the book.    Plot    When Billy is abducted by the aliens of Tralfamadore, he learns to go through time and experience the events of his life out of order.  The book talks a lot about war, and how horrible it can be.    Enjoyment    I guess I just didn't get it.  This book is regarded as a great antiwar book, and I can see that it pokes fun at war, but it just didn't work for me.  The humor in the book was there the whole time, but it just wasn't all that funny to me.  There was also sometime in the book that drove me crazy as I kept reading it.  It seemed like every other page (if not more often) Vonnegut would punctuate a scene by typing the sentence \\"So it goes.\\"  We've all been in classes where you have to give presentations to the rest of the class.  Many times, people would say \\"um\\" constantly throughout their presentations.  I was originally an education major, and I was told to watch my speech to avoid saying \\"um\\" as it becomes distracting.  \\"So it goes.\\" became distracting to me in this book.  My paperback copy of the book was 215 pages long, I would be that Vonnegut wrote \\"So it goes.\\" at least 100 times in this book, probably more.    Overall Grade    I can't recommend this book to anyone, the humor didn't work for me all that well, and the book irritated me by the end of it.  So it goes.    2/10    This and all of my reviews are available on my blog, check out my profile for the link to my blog.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|As a huge Foo Fighter fan my opinion will probably sound biased but after a recent few decent but not spectacular albums Dave Grohl has killed yet another one. Not very often where every single song on an album is great but this is the case with Wasting Light. Pat Smear is back, just adds to this albums greatness. From Bridge Burning to Walk (my two favorite songs on the album) every song just hits home. If you're a Foo Fighter fan or just enjoy their music this is a must own album.

B0050XFY4O|1.0|This incest love story about two half brothers in Brazil is a small disaster .    12 year old Francisco and 6 year old Thomas are as lovingly protective of each other as siblings can be . Various family members do take notice of this and while midly worried about it taking a wrong turn , they quickly accept it as a possible scenario for the two kids . Fast forward fifteen years and they both have become absolutely gorgeous and are now crazy in love with each other . Not an eyebrow is raised throughout the film by any remaining family members or friends . The drama only comes into the equation when Thomas gets an offer to prepare to swim for the olympic team of his country in Russia . Now , for the first time , the two men will have to eventually spend some time away from each other .    Despite it's controversial theme , this is not a challenging film ...it's the quitte opposite really . There's no real character development what so ever and it's difficult to sympathise with a relationship the viewer knows nothing about . Were there struggles the men had to face in order to undertand or accept their love ? Have they been single up until this point ? Are they gay or just in love with each other ? ( in a curious twist , Francisco starts flirting with a girl once Thomas is away ) . The zero chemistry between actors Vasconcellos and Cardoso also doesn't help either.     I dont know if director Abranches wants to say  that he considers his two heroes' relationship the most natural choice when there's so much true love involved , and that's why he places it in such a tolerant , open-minded social scenery or if he didn't have a script to work with in the first place . The movie is dedicated to his parents, but i enden up not giving a damn about any of the two men or what might happen between them . The film is indeed schocking . It's schocking how indifferent it really is .

1439163154|3.0|Lockheed left me with a strong feeling of pity for Marissa, a feeling I prefer not to feel, and which can be hard for me to feel.  This begs the question of how James Franco got me there.  This is how ...    From the opening paragraph we learn that Marissa's situation is that of an adolescent girl who is not free to pursue her independently chosen values, and growing incapable of identifying them.  Though she excels at mathematics, it is a chore, which she pursues at the insistence of her father who \\"does math all day\\".  We learn that she is not popular in high school and has a very limited social life so that her only friend is her gay cousin, Jamie.  In the opening we also learn that she doesn't announce her mathematical excellence to peers, and therefore, it may not be the case that her social life suffers because she is great at math, and it does win her a prestigious summer internship at Lockheed Martin.  Her overbearing father seems to have good intentions with the unfair ascetic life he imposes on his blossoming teenage daughter:  to work together one day with her.  The oppression by her father, however, is the key to her low psychological state.    Her job at Lockheed consisted of watching film of a seldom dynamic subject, the moon, in a cold room without a view, looking for rare mistakes, for 40 hours a week.  The boredom leads her to begin to draw prolifically but mostly violent and sex related subjects.  Her overall assessment of this activity:  \\"I drew hundreds of pictures and they were all bad.  I wasn't good at drawing.  It was also a little sad to draw so much because I could see everything that was inside me.  I had drawn everything I could think of.  All that was inside me was a bunch of toys, and TV shows, and my family.  My life was boring.  I only had one kiss, and it was my gay cousin Jamie.\\"      Marissa is a girl utterly lacking excitement in life at an age that should be centered on exploration, curiosity, the adventure of self-discovery, andthe glory of learning according to her interests and talents.  Yet she is a girl who has become very reluctant to look inside herself, and therefore, in danger of atrophy.  This is reinforced by an oppressive father who condemns her to a regime of almost monkish asceticism in the epitome of the ivory tower which is Mathematics.  She seems to be a girl floating further and further away from the glories of reality.  The saving grace of her reality seems to be her talent and genuine interest in drawing; this seems to be the clue to her future happiness.  Yet she suffers from low self-esteem and judges herself a weak artist.  Typically, with the right encouragement, she could become an excellent artist, as she is still young enough, and she exhibits a budding passion.    However, to add to her torment, her boss at Lockheed, Jan, crushes her artistic passion with his own cynicism which consists of the premise that an artist is doomed to failure and frustration, as he shows her his own drawings from youth, which are but futile, faint echoes of a roaring passion that was silenced too long ago.  \\"I did these when I was at school.  I wanted to be artist.  But it was no good.  It is no good to be artist.  I practiced every day, eight hours a day.  Then I could draw like Michelangelo.  Then what?  There is already Michelangelo.  I realized there was nothing more to do.  In science, there is always more to learn.  Always more.\\"  These are the words of a man who never deserved to be an artist because he never learned the sacred and personal life-giving fuel that an artistic soul gives to itself in the process of bringing his vision into reality for his own eyes to see.    She is transformed into a girl whose only conscious longing is to gain social acceptance, one of the hallmarks of pseudo-self-esteem.  The next reminiscence that Marissa shares with us is at a Fourth of July Party at Katie Hesher's house, Marissa's first high school party.  Marissa is still innocent; beer forher still tastes like \\"thick, frothy urine\\".  At the party she gets acquainted with a handsome, rebellious boy, Ronny Feldman.  Ronny got kicked out of a couple of schools and is now condemned to go to a special education school, due to fighting and reckless behaviour.  \\"He was wearing a white T-shirt that was thin from being washed so many times.  The neck was wasting away.  His arms were thin but muscular.  They had all these old scars and bruises on them.  He had short, straight blond hair and a cherubic face, with a perfect nose.  He was so handsome, but also like a little boy and dangerous.\\"  She is innocent and falls for him too easily.  Given her development up to that point and the circumstances of her boring existence, it is easy to understand her attraction to this bad ass, as he represents danger, adventure, and excitement, not to mention, he would surely be the type of boy her father would disapprove of.      But more than this, he seems to appreciate that she is intelligent, a virtue that she is ashamed of.  And just as he names this fact, which is the point at which she falls in love with him, he is taken away from her abruptly.  He is taunted to get into a fight with a Latino guy with whom he has history.  It is a big spectacle and it is sprinkled with eroticism for Marissa: Ronny, true to his nature, exhibits his virility in his fighting efficacy, and takes off his shirt, as do his partners in this fight, and it also rains, which adds to the beauty of these young impassioned boys.  To reinforce this, Ronny and his friends win the fight and chase the Latino crew away, Ronny for the fleeting moment a hero in Marissa's restricted universe.      And then it happens.      Ronny is returned to the party on the hood of an SUV and is dropped on the street outside, badly beaten.  The truck drives away but soon returns to run over and kill Ronny.  Marissa is left screaming in torment.  When questioned by the Police she is still fixated over Ronny's identification of her intelligence.  It is clear that she will be scarred by this tragedy for a long time.  And to make the effect just a touch more pity-inspiring James Franco adds that she was not invited to the funeral because no one knew that she was the last person Ronny spoke to.  In conclusion James Franco summarizes the rest of her summer and her psychological state in compelling and poetic prose:    \\"I worked at Lockheed for the rest of the summer.  I didn't draw anymore.  My parents could tell I was sad, but I couldn't tell them why.  I couldn't even tell Jamie.  I didn't do much but watch the moon.  It floated there, on the films, reverberant.  I began picturing Ronny's face in the moon.  My face was there too and he was kissing me.  Whenever there was a scratch on the film it would pull me out of the daydream, and I would mark it down.\\"    Undeniably touching.

0962477060|3.0|As a more advanced player, I found most of this book quite obvious and dull. The way the book presents itself is a bit deceptive, in that it proposes to explain that the tuning system of the guitar is somehow special. There are many different ways of tuning the guitar (DADGAD, Open C, Open G, etc.) that all have their special advantages and downfalls. For example, it is impossible to play a 6 note chord whose notes were all a half step apart (why would you want to?) given the standard tuning of the guitar but that type of chord and similar chords whose intervallic relationships were relatively small would be easy given a tuning system where the strings were tuned to half steps of eachother. Another thing about tuning is that, whatever system you choose to use, each will have fingering forms whose shapes and relationships to similar chords will be constant and still becomes a matter of decoding the chord relationships based on the way the scales are fingered. That's true with most tunings. I suspect that the guitar's tuning system arose partly by the long history the instrument has had with adding (as in the vihuela) or subtracting strings (the lute - who knows how many strings?!) and what became \\"standard\\" tuning was partly an accident and partly tradition. This book really shines as a good introduction for beginners looking to become familiar with the way chords, scales and arpeggios are tightly related to each other and how to learn them without getting overwhelmed by something like a scale book or a chord encyclopaedia. As for advanced players wanting to know more about the fretboard, nothing beats the Guitar Grimoire Scales and Modes. As for total musicianship, nothing will ever replace learning to sight read proficiently, practicing a lot, playing with other people and learning new music all of the time. Those are really the most important things I can think for a lifetime of continuous improvement on any instrument. There you are!

B003405MF6|4.0|...then this is a Jeff Beck album you might appreciate.  In places it has hooks into mainstream blues-rock in lieu of hard blues, techno, or fusion but to me the center of this collection of songs is thoughtful and deep expression.  I'm a punter on guitar but instead of making me feel like I should just put my axe in the case forever, I find it inspirational - it makes me say to myself, \\"See what you can do??\\"    A spiritual cousin to E&C might be my favorite Weather Report album, NIGHT PASSAGE.    I had \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" playing in the car one afternoon last weekend when I was running errands with my family and my ear caught something I hadn't noticed.  I stepped the CD player back a bit to hear it again, saying \\"Did he just do what I think...\\"  Beck had played the melody for the line \\"Some - wheeeeere...\\" normally but followed it with a single plucked natural harmonic and played the rest of the line (\\"...oooover the rain - boooow\\") using only the whammy bar, in perfect pitch.  Holy crap, that's nice.
0880794968|5.0|I've had these cards for almost a year now, and aside from some dirt that got stuck to them, they are just as good quality as they were when i got them. They all look beautiful as well. The small box they came in is starting to fall apart, but that's not really that bad if you think about it. Although i'm not sure what i'll do with them once i don't have a box for them. I would definitely recommend these.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|I have had a love/not love relationship with Murphy's solo releases over the years, (never \\"hate\\" mind you...just an occasional \\"not love\\"). His solo work ranges from brilliant to good-but-a-little-too-precious. Some longtime fans will catch my meaning; others will vehemently disagree, but we all have our unique tastes, don't we? On this disc, however, PM nails it. Every note is in place and nothing is there that shouldn't be there. The thing about Murphy is not just his great voice but his unique way of using it: Velocity Bird, the opening cut, demonstrates this beautifully. To the non-Murphy connoisseur, it can almost sound like he's \\"scooping\\" the notes, unable to land on the pitch properly. But oh no...a closer listen will show this to be no mistake: it's there on purpose and it's perfect. A lesser singer could never pull this off. And his lyrics here are pitch-perfect too: he hits the beauty and the darkness, often in the same phrase. \\"I spit roses\\" conjures up some great poetic imagery in three little words.<br /><br />On a semi-related note: to anyone who is reading this and has yet to pick up the newest and final Bauhaus CD \\"Go Away White\\", you should know that it too is an amazing recording. They got it right; bringing back the old magic while not becoming parodies of their 1980s selves. Buy both. You will thank yourself.
B000L53D4O|5.0|My 14-month-old kid was pulling up, standing, furniture-walking and everything, but REFUSED TO PRACTICE WALKING. We'd try to set him down on his feet or pull him up, and he'd kinda flip out. Finally, we ordered this thing, and he immediately set off pushing it, with a great big grin on his face. Once he got the confidence and a little muscle practice, it was cake from there. He started walking on his own just three weeks later. Yay baby!    We'd considered buying the superexpensive Haba walker, or maybe the Radio Flyer one, and boy I'm so glad we saved our money and bought this great value of a walker instead. This thing exactly what's needed for the job of coaxing your kid to walk, it's simple, easy to set up, and the kiddo loves playing with the toys on the front.

B004XD03RK|5.0|The 2011 Reissue of Death's magnum opus 'Human' is defiantely something not to miss out on. Especially for fans who still have the original pressing of the album, myself included, the guys at Relapse have done a phenominal job remixing this album. And when I say remix, I want to make clear: I use that term loosely, as the album has not be drastically altered to upset old fans(cough cough Dave Mustaine). So far listening to the original album, the only difference is that you can finally hear the amazing Steve DiGiorgio's magnificent bass work in the album, especially on the beginning of Lack of Comprehension. One major thing I did discover is that on See Through Dreams, where on the original album it segued into Cosmic Sea, it does not on this remixed version, instead fading out slightly before going to Cosmic Sea. The bonus tracks are especially nice, with the first official state-side release of the B-side KISS cover God of Thunder, and what a great cover it is! Great version! The bonus Demo's and instrumental takes on discs 2 and 3(depending on which version you get, I only got the 2-disc version) are very cool and very sentimental to the Death fans. You can hear Chuck and the band progressing this far for the first time and it is absolutely amazing to be able to hear these sessions. Many thanks to Relapse Records and Eric Greif for overseeing these fantastic reissues, and hopes for the continued excellence in the rest of the back catalog reissueing and the legacy of Chuck Schuldiner.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|I bought this item for my neice. There were alot of little pieces that I believe will be easily lost. But she was very excited to get this toy which she had asked for and seemed to have a lot of fun playing with it.
0307454541|3.0|It took me almost a week just to get through the first couple chapters. It's slow and boring , but it does give you that extra background that the rest of the story needs. Growing up with strong Scandinavian heritage, I didn't have a problem with pronoucing names or places; but I understand it is diffcult to interprete. The overall story is excellent! If I had to explain it; it would be a mystery of family secrets.(bookmark the family tree. Your going to need to go back.)Sex and Rape is apart of the family story but I did feel there was a lot of sex that really didn't have a place. Like Mikael being a horn dog and Lisbeth and her guardian. However, I think that the disappearance storyline makes up for it. It was figured it out about 2/3 through(I was right) but it still had a twist.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|First: Why in the heck would you rate this low? The quality is going to be great. The only low ratings are from people who didn't like the season.    Guess what???? IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T BUY IT.    Now, for those who love LOST and loved this season, BUY THIS NOW :D  it's amazing. Definitely worth the money and half the price through here than in stores. 5/5
0553381695|5.0|[This review contains no major spoilers for A Clash of Kings, but it does outline the basic premise of a few characters' storylines, and there are major spoilers for A Game of Thrones as well.]<br /><br />At the end of A Game of Thrones, a red comet appeared in the sky.  Its presence dominates the opening chapters of A Clash of Kings, as every faction in the conflict rippling across the continent of Westeros interprets the comet as a portent of its own victory.  At most one of these interpretations is correct, of course, and the book is silent on what the comet actually means, if it has any significance apart from the astronomical.  That's the way of magic in this series; it's vague, difficult to explain, nothing if not equivocal.<br /><br />Mysterious and strange though magic may be, its power is on the rise in A Clash of Kings.  Whether, as is suggested at one point, its resurgence has to do with the birth of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons is another open question.  What's certain is that magic casts its ominous shadow over the events of this novel, creating at intervals an atmosphere of uncanny threat uncommon in epic fantasy, more reminiscent of classic tales of horror, the supernatural, and the weird.  The locations in which A Game of Thrones took place were largely based on medieval precedents, basically familiar to readers of epic fantasy, though reinvigorated by Martin's use of gritty historical detail.  New settings in A Clash of Kings are less familiar, and more disturbing.<br /><br />The book's gem of a prologue introduces readers to Stannis, brother of the late king Robert and a major player in the titular conflict.  Stannis' home, the island fortress of Dragonstone, is a dark, eerie place, made all the more so by the arrival of a priestess from a distant religion.  As an elderly adviser who raised Stannis after the death of his parents tries to curtail the priestess' rising influence, the reader learns of the sad history, grim architecture and melancholy inhabitants of the fortress.  Full of world-building, character development, and hints of the impossible, this thirty-page chapter is a model of fantasy storytelling.  Further chapters in this narrative strand, with a new point-of-view character, are less dazzling, but still excellent, and never without ambiguous aspects.<br /><br />The second new point-of-view character introduces the reader to the Iron Islands, a harsh environment whose inhabitants live a harsh lifestyle not dissimilar to that of the Vikings.  The bare, stony, sea-swept islands have their own religion, less comforting than that of the mainland; almost Lovecraftian, in fact.  And then there's the city visited by Daenerys, an ornate mecca full of vast buildings, strange beasts, and warlocks.  These chapters have about them something of Jack Vance, whom George R. R. Martin regards as the greatest living fantasist.  Unlike some writers of epic fantasy, whose influences begin and end with Tolkien, Martin has read widely in fantasy, science fiction, and horror, and the vast world he creates reflects all of that reading.<br /><br />But these new characters and situations are balanced by old ones, by the same mix of courtly intrigue and violent action that characterized A Game of Thrones.  As the book opens, Tyrion Lannister arrives in King's Landing to act in his father's place as Hand of the King.  But enemies and potential enemies are everywhere, from the eunuch spymaster Varys to the calculating treasurer Littlefinger to his own sister, Queen Regent Cersei, and her spoiled, unstable son, King Joffrey.  Tyrion will need his sharp wit to survive, and indeed, he puts it to good use in some of the most entertaining chapters in the entire series.  Although many of the protagonists of A Song of Ice and Fire fancy themselves to be master manipulators, Tyrion is the only point-of-view character who has a real genius for such things, and his fierce sense of humor lends his arc a particular edge.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Arya Stark, daughter of the executed Eddard, is in disguise as a boy, being led north toward home.  That course takes her through the lands devastated by the conflict the nobles of various houses have so blithely started, and gives her a rapid education in the cruelties of war.  Death and disease are rampant, and only strength, intelligence, and bloody-minded cruelty of one's own offer a chance of survival.  Despite being a young girl, Arya quickly demonstrates her growing mastery of all three.  Like many characters in the series, she's on a dark road, and things seem likely to get much worse before they get better.<br /><br />These are only some of the protagonists and situations of the novel, and I've barely hinted at the growing moral ambiguity of the series, created by the widening range of point-of-view characters, each with his or her own plans, flaws, histories, and justifications.  A Song of Ice and Fire is truly a mammoth story, combining the best of epic fantasy, historical fiction, sword-and-sorcery, and horror.  The author has described his childhood reading as \\"all sorts of weird stuff,\\" and that's also a good description for this series: all sorts of weird, wonderful stuff.nwhile, Arya Stark, daughter of the executed Eddard, is in disguise as a boy, being led north toward home.

B000002UHG|3.0|Rick Wright dedicated his 1996 album, \\"Broken China,\\" to all those brave enough to face their past.  With an introduction like that, one might get the impression that the songs on this CD are a downer, the type that get weighed under by their own heavy issues.  True, some tracks are meditative, but the music is often upbeat and interesting.  A big part of this is because of the musicians involved.  Manu Katche, Pino Palladino, and Tim Renwick add flesh to the subtle space-age keyboards Wright became famous for during his stay in Pink Floyd.  While the presence of Sinead O'Connor, who lends vocals to two tracks, may initially sound out of place here, her voice suits the material quite nicely.    This 16-song cycle, written by Wright and Anthony Moore, was released shortly after Pink Floyd's last studio album, \\"The Division Bell,\\" and illustrates that Wright was a more prolific composer than most Floyd albums would lead us to believe.  Moreover, the melodies are tight and smartly arranged.    In regard to packaging, the CD booklet is designed by long-time Floyd collaborator, Storm Thorgerson, and includes the lyrics, as well as front and back cover artwork reminiscent of \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"    The comparisons between the themes of both \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Broken China\\" can't be overlooked.  Conceptually, both albums mirror each other.  Consider this lyric from \\"Breakthrough,\\" the final track on the Wright CD.  \\"You hide somewhere / you die somewhere / and then this senseless thought, / by hating more / you're feeling more / and that's how you get caught.\\"    Yet, \\"Broken China\\" has an identity all its own.  The strength of the material is a testament that Rick Wright was a skillful composer and a talented solo artist.  I give the CD three stars for everything stated above.  Recommended for the Pink Floyd completist.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Holds my Plantronics Voyager Pro+ snugly.  Very convenient.  I broke my last Voyager Pro by taking it out of my pocket too much and too forcibly.  The case is handy and inexpensive.
0439023521|5.0|The author writes in a way that makes you feel a part of Panem.  You're both outraged and fascinated by the levels of need/greed in the different districts.  There's definitely a lesson to be learned.  It made me think of reality television and how some folks find it entertaining, while others realize it's often a portrayal of mental illness.  The brutality is shocking, but you find yourself rooting for Katniss and completely sympathetic to the triangle she finds herself a part of.

0465043577|4.0|I met Benoit Mandelbrot at a conference at Columbia University back in early 2001.  It was a conference on the use of fractals in a wide number of subject areas, very few of which dealt with economics.  Mandelbrot was on of the few panelists to include anything on economics, though a few of the biologists gave me some ideas.<br /><br />As far as I could tell there were only two economists at the conference, and we went out for Indian food together at lunch.  I met Dr. Mandelbrot at the wine reception where we discussed the state of the markets.  He and his friend, George Soros, both feared that Wall Street was mishedged, and that a crisis was coming.<br /><br />Bright guy, though the eventual crisis was a liquidity crisis, and not a hedging crisis.  But the diversity of people in terms of field of study at the conference helps to explain what drove Mandelbrot intellectually.  He saw analogies across a wide number of phenomena, connected by one main idea -- similar power laws.<br /><br />The book points out the now-well-known fact that price changes are more volatile than the normal distribution will allow.  That has impacts on option pricing and portfolio management.<br /><br />The book's criticism of Modern Portfolio Theory, another idealistic creation of economists that neglects real world data is excellent.  From a misdefinition of risk as being equivalent to volatility springs the monstrosity of MPT.<br /><br />The book shoes many ways where the received orthodoxy of MPT and the efficient markets hypothesis fails.  The only reason these idea hang around is that they are accepted uncritically, almost like a cult.  The chapter on the \\"Heresies of Finance\\" is particularly good, and poses problems for much of academic finance.<br /><br />I liked the book a lot, and think that most academics and practitioners should read it.  It will broaden your horizons, even if you disagree after you have read it.<br /><br />Quibbles<br /><br />The main difficulty is this: just because A follows a similar power law to B, does not mean that A & B have something in common.  There are often spurious correlations.<br /><br />Who would benefit from this book:<br /><br />Most serious investors and academics could benefit from the book.  It will challenge your preconceptions.  That doesn't mean that everything Mandelbrot writes is correct, but most of his criticisms of MPT are correct.  The question becomes what to replace MPT with?B have something in common.  There are often spurious correlations.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|This was an okay film, definitely worth seeing but I'm glad I rented it rather than paying big bucks to see it on screen. I think the acting is well done, and the even tho the story is a bit predictable, it was enjoyable to watch. Liev Schreiber is just so darn good, I could watch anything he was in. It was a little too violent for me in places, but I'm sure others would disagree.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I thought The Lincoln Lawyer to be Connely's best work to date. The Fifth Witness while not quite up to par with The Lincoln Lawyer was still a fun read. Any book with Mickey Haller deserves a try as he is one of the most original characters in modern American fiction. Fast paced and enjoyable, unlike the miserable Gods Of Ruin, Haller gets in his shots at the LAPD while still admiring Harry Bosch, another of Connely's wonderful characters. Not his best work but worth the price.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I love the Roller Coaster Tycoon series but this one is so much fun.  There is a lot to do and it will keep you entertained for hours and hours.  More 3-D than the first two and so many levels it will be a while before I finish the thing!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|For action packed thrillers, unlike the amazingly boring Gods Of Ruin, you can't beat Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. In this day of political correctness, men trying to breast feed their babies etc. it's refreshing to see a no nonsense character like Reacher. If you enjoyed any of the other Reacher books you won't be disappointed with Bad Luck and Trouble.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|If you are a classic movie lover, you will love Mildred Pierce.  It is full of suspense and keeps you guessing.  Joan Crawford is great in this movie, it is one that you could watch periodically and still enjoy.
B00136Q2KW|5.0|I first bought Listen Without Prejudice on cassette when it was first released, and I think I wore it out. George Michael's voice is like honey, coating your soul and filling in the cracks left from the times when your heart broke. There are also some amazing, expressive lyrics to go along with stellar arrangements. This record is not surface fluff by any means, instead inspiring feeling and provoking thought about the fact that we are all in this thing together. If I were trapped on a desert island, I would want to have this record; it's that good.
B001POX73C|4.0|I had not read this author before. My first reaction was, \\"What is this\\"? All those run-on sentences and the British slang that I couldn't understand and yet in the context of the conversations I sort of did understand. The story line was simplistic while still in a way convoluted and yet entertaining. I didn't see how the title related to the story at all because I hardly think there was a cotillion mentioned in the whole book.   For those of you who thought that in the beginning Jack was just that, he turned out to be just that. So no surprise turn around for him. Also, for a romance novel there was very little romance. The so-called romance portions were not very romantic. The focus of the book was more on a different look into British social conventions and how the characters strived to get around them. The ending was a bit of a surprise and not at all conventional. All in all I am torn between a 3 and 4 star rating on this but thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt. I think I will have to read another of this author's works as a comparison.

0307474275|1.0|After hearing all the hype about this book, I finally decided to try it for myself. And now I really don't understand why this book got (and continues to get) so much attention.<br /><br />I never knew that I could actually get sick of cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter...until I read this book. The chapters are very, very short. And there are lots of them. The writing style is that of an eighth-grader. It is simplistic and tells more than shows. It does all those things you were taught to avoid doing in order to write well. I've read many, many outstanding books that have never gotten the kind of hype \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has, which is sad.<br /><br />This is clear evidence of the adage that \\"best-selling\\" does not necessarily equate to \\"best written.\\"
0345529057|1.0|I love my kindle very much, but amazon has done something nearly unforgivable in my mind. The organization of this book does not work properly and without knowing this the table of contents brought me to the fourth book instead of the first, where it immediately gave away the deaths of 5 characters previously unknown to me. Now I have to suffer this knowledge through the rest of the series. This has enraged me to no end, I cannot believe amazon has allowed this to happen. Do not buy the four pack, something like this may happen to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is the first book in one of the most engaging trilogies I've ever read. I bought the book based on some recommendations from friends and once I started it I couldn't put it down! The story draws you in and refuses to let you go. Even at the points where it gets so gruesome and brutal that you want nothing more than to set it down and walk away, the book latches on and forces you to continue. Your heart will ache, you will feel angry, you will feel confused and it will all be worth it.     The story is told from the point of view of Katniss Everdeen (a 16-year-old girl from a poor and hungry District) and follows her brutal journey from her starvation in the poorest of the oppressed districts to the Hunger Games, which take place in the oppressive state of the Capital. She is forced to kill or be killed. The children in the Hunger Games are reduced to animals while audiences watch with bated breath and place bets on the participants. The concept is disturbing and gruesome and at times resembles both the gladiator battles of ancient Rome and \\"Battle Royale\\". But this story is so much more.     It is a story of friendship, bravery, politics and - most of all - survival. And it's only the beginning. After you finish \\"The Hunger Games\\" you will feel obliged to read the following stories. Throughout all three books, Suzanne Collins will take you on an emotional roller coaster and you will be more than grateful.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|This watch looks, feels, and keeps time well if you wear it all the time.  If  I place this watch down during the evening then put it on the next morning it may or may not run all night so the time and day date will not change.  I'm not sure if it's me or the watch but of course I'll need to return it to Seiko warranty not Amazon as I cut off the tab before knowing the problem.    The crown is impossible to screw down after setting the time.  I'm not sure if this allows water to creep in or what, this is a bad design feature.    It's a shame because this watch looks and feels to be exactly what I wanted at a good price.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|This publisher's greed is beyond acceptable!!  I have read this series years ago, and to have these kindle versions be more than double the writers cut is plain ugly!

B003QNXPUK|5.0|I can understand how some people may not be fond of this product but I love it and am glad I got it. Two points:   1) Installation- if you don't have patience or think you are too good to spend some time with it, then this product is not for you. I figured it would take some time since this kit protects the entire phone. I sat down in front of the Tv with my table, the kit, and a roll of paper towlels. I spent an hour total but it was worth it. Like tinting your windows the product uses a wet sealent so you have to be patient. First I did the back of the phone since it is the easiest and any flaws in my installation won't be as noticable. It probably took 3 times of retrying to settle the film perfectly but after I got it where I wanted, I just held the center down with my finger, wiped outwards with the tool, dabbed  up any extra liquid with the paper towel and let it sit for 20 min under the lamp. Since it is wet for a litle bit trying to do all sides of the phone at once will just lead to trouble cause you will accidently move one fild while trying to do another side.  Then I did the side films, they were very easy, just take the time to make sure it is lined up well and there is no overhang so you dont snag it. I did the the small pieces first and the big piece last, wait about 5-10 min for each side again so you dont accidently move the film while wet.  Lastly I did the front film, very easy and I got it on the second try, wipe out the bubbles, dab up extra fluid and let it sit. I put the phone under a lamp for the night and didn't touch it till the next morning. by then it was all dry and perfect.    2) since it is a more durable, high quality protector it is not a crystal clear invisible screen. It has a texture (just slightly) which I like cause the factory screen is almost slippery i had a difficult time texting. The screen does NOT cover up the camera which is also a plus. It cleans very easily and does not hold finger prints or oils. Now I take my phone to the beach or whereever and I have no worries about scratching it     Great product!
B0006GVJEE|1.0|The main movie would not play on any of my DVD players While the extras disc played on all of them. In all fairness I must admit that the main disc appeared to be in perfect condition I don't see how this problem could have been anticipated. I do feel that the item should have been replaced instead of having to wait 10 days for my account to be credited. I feel Amazon should change this policy
B0052VUNHC|5.0|My first book review ever, but I felt I needed to write one.  Someone reccommended this book on the discussion board and I'm sooo grateful she did.  It was truly and awesome read for me.  I felt all the ups and downs of Travis and Abby aka Pigeon. Not a lot of books have taken me on that relationship roller coaster.  Who wouldn't love Travis, he's the ultimate bad boy who finally finds \\"THE ONE\\" and who wouldn't want to be the one who tames him.  Not Abby...at first.  This is one of those books you won't regret buying and would've paid more for it.  Make sure you have some time just sit and read because you won't be able to do anything else until you finish it...then you'll wish you took your time because you didn't want it to end.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|The album feels like it's using a slightly different style of music than the previous albums (I just can't figure out how to explain it) but it's still awesome.<br /><br />It took a while for some of the songs to grow on me, but I love all the songs on this album. I know it's obvious, but if you like Within Temptation, you'll like this album.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|IMO, these first five releases from Queen represent their best work.  It's possible to listen to how the signature Queen sound was created, and how the members individully developed. I have the original lp's, in addition to the 20th Anniversary releases.  Thanks to technology, the sound has been cleaned up and enchanced.  This is particularly noticable on the first two albums, Queen and Queen II.  One needs to remember that even though original masters were used, back in the day, multiple tracks were layered, meaning you can't change one thing without changing everything on the track, however things may have progressed in cleaning and enchancing the sound.  I especially loved hearing how Freddie's voice grew with age and experience.  The extras included on the extra disc's were a great treat. Since I don't especially want to hear them each time I listen, I appreciate that they were seperate.  Well worth the mon3ey.  Long live Queen!
031603441X|5.0|Heard LIFE (Hachette Audio), Keith Richards' memoir written with James Fox.<br /><br />It contains everything you wanted to know about both Richards and the Rolling Stones--and then some . . . 576 pages in length, including 32 pages of pictures that were fortunately included in a bonus PDF, I would have preferred had it been about half as long.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I loved the first third of the book, in which he described his childhood and the formation of the band . . . the middle third of the book was just too much about drugs, though I did find it interesting to read about his split with Mick Jagger and their respective solo careers . . . the final third seemed to rush through his present life, and it seemed to be little more than a collection of tales that might be told on THE TONIGHT SHOW.<br /><br />LIFE did include many memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* [on figuring out the system by his teens] There's bigger bullies than just bullies. There's \\"them,\\" the authorities.<br /><br />* [on his \\"criminal mind\\" as a kid] \\"He has maintained a low standard\\" was the six-word summary of my 1959 school record, suggesting, correctly, that I had put some into the enterprise.\\"<br /><br />* Music was a far bigger drug than smack. I could kick smack. I couldn't quit music. One note leads to another, and you never know what's going to come next, and you don't want to. It's like walking on a beautiful tightrope.<br /><br />* [on the bond between him and Jagger when they listened to Chicago blues as kids] We both knew we were in a process of learning, and it was something you wanted to learn and it was ten times better than school.<br /><br />* I used to set the riffs and titles and the hook, and Mick would fill in. We didn't think much or analyze. . . . Take it away, Mick. Your job now. I've given you the riff, baby.<br /><br />* For many years, I slept, on average, twice a week.<br /><br />The book was narrated by Johnny Depp and Joe Hurley, and it also featured Richards at times . . . I actually found the back-and-forth somewhat disconcerting.erting.
B001TODO54|1.0|I love stories/epic tales with strong female leads. When I read the reviews and premise of Graceling, I thought it was the perfect book for me--fantasy genre, strong female lead and a tale of self-discovery.     Boy, was I mislead...     The history behind the magic in this book is not very well explained, leaving readers with no back story or explanation. Further, there was barely any history provided for the different kingdoms, so I found myself having to constantly go back to the one spot of the book that provided a little information.     The \\"strong female lead\\" in this book was actually quiet boring and only strong in terms of physical attributes. I did not like how she gave herself into Po so quickly, without much thought or protest. This left little for romance for the rest of the book, as readers had nothing to look forward to.     The writing was also very drawn out. I wound up skipping many pages in order to get to some action.     I would not recommend this book, which is unfortunate. The author could have gone way more in depth with the great list of characters, but readers were instead provided with little background and no character development.

In addition to the police, she's pursued by her dad, the aforementioned Svenson, and some Bond movie henchman who is her half brother.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I've owned this DVD for a little over a year and have never used it as it was intended until recently. I would do a workout here and there if I didn't have a lot of time that day to work out longer. With one failed attempt to complete a full 30-Day Shred cycle last year, I tried to prove to myself that I could do a whole cycle.    I did two weeks of 5-days-a-week on each level, stretching it out to a 6-week cycle. Again, not how it was intended but that was the closest I was going to get. I completed it and I feel I can accurately review it.     Overall, this is an excellent DVD. The workouts are tough but the real beauty of them is they last 25 minutes and it's over like that. I am obsessed with the 3-2-1 system, which breaks up the workout nicely and gives you a sense of accomplishment with each circuit you complete. Jillian Michaels, who can sometimes be a little too much, is the right amount of motivational and tough. I cannot sing its praises enough. I noticed good muscle tone at the end of it but lost no weight. I credit this to a lack of a proper \\"I'm losing weight\\" diet.    The reason I give it a 4 is simply for what I feel to be a lack of repeatability. The program does get repetitious and I get sick of it easily. I am not sure of the long-term effects of doing this program over and over again but I feel like my mind would scream in boredom. However, as a person who consistently seeks novelty in every area of my life, you may take this one little criticism with a grain of salt.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|The great energy and depth of the love between the brothers is joyous and a true insight into a one of kind bond that will never end. Beautiful! A love so perfect the lovers can never be separated because they only exist as one impossible to separate entity. It was right and natural and prefect when they were together. It was unbearable when they were apart. They hurt no one. I don't see this kind of perfect happiness happening often between bothers but if it exists for some unique people then the only thing that would be wrong would be to forbid a love so deep and so joyful.
068981528X|5.0|Very clever and charming!  The modern references were a funny surprise; I didn't expect to see Plexiglas and video intercoms mentioned in here!  My six-year-old daughter and I laughed at several parts throughout...great for today's kids.  The illustrations were wonderful as well.  We were enthralled from beginning to end and could not wait to see how it ended.  This book is excellent for it's creativity and originality.  Most of the time, reading is a chore for my daughter, but she did not complain ONCE while she read this one to me.  I would love to find more books like this.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I was willing to forgive the outrageous price for the four-book Kindle bundle due to the convenience of not having to cart an enormous paperback with me ... but there's no convenience at all in trying to read the Kindle edition of the bundle. To start, the maps are tiny. More importantly, the menu does not work. When I've tried to bring up the contents, it takes me to the Book 4 contents. \\"Beginning\\" takes me to the beginning of Book 4. And then, of course, it's almost impossible to find the \\"location\\" I was reading because my \\"last page read\\" is wrong. Finally, since all four books are in one file, it's impossible to loan them one at a time. And who could read the whole 4,000-page file in the two-week loan period? I'm really tempted to return this and just borrow the books from a friend--the price is right and I know the \\"technology\\" will work!
1451626657|5.0|Catch-22 remains one of my favorite books for many reasons, but most of all for the perfected black humor. I also appreciate the witticism amid serious themes of war -- I can imagine it's very difficult to create an uproariously funny novel while keeping the heartbreaking absurdity of war at the heart of it.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Each and every song on this two disc set is incredible. A nice variety of older and current (at least current when this was recorded) songs which displayed each of the band members enormous talent. A must have collection for any Alison Krauss + Union Station fan.

0525422943|4.0|It's been three years since Mia Hall was in the devasting and tragic accident found in If I Stay. Mia went on to Julliard and is living in New York City while Adam's band has done remarkably well and he is an official \\"rock star\\" with all the less-than-desirable encumbrances. Adam isn't handling them very well, in fact he hasn't handled life well at all since Mia left. Where She Went tells the story of Adam finding Mia by chance in New York while he is there with his band, of them haltingly reconnecting and then finding understanding.    What I liked about the book: I liked the symmetry of the two novels, that the first is in Mia's voice, the second in Adam's, that what happened to break them apart and how Adam handled things in the ensuing years is told little by little just as Mia's story was, that each becomes the other's savior in a way. I think that the author is really good at letting us get inside their heads so that they feel like real people even when they act in a way I would never act. I think that their emotions are very real.  I enjoyed reading the books within a week or two of each other.  If there had been a lot of time between I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.    What I didn't like:  I really really didn't like Adam at all through much of the book.  I thought that he had many of the worst characteristics that seem to be somewhat common to celebrities, such as his whiny and petulant behavior, his extreme absorption with himself, his violent outbursts, his pill-popping, his inability to get along with his bandmates, and even his cigarette smoking, all of which seemed to portray someone with disdain for others.  He seemed so angry and angsty and just didn't seem to care about anyone, most especially himself.  It wasn't until at least 2/3's of the way through the book that I started to like him again, when I understood why he was so angry, that he had given so much to Mia only to have her turn her back on him for what seemed to him to be noreason.  He had needed to grieve for the loss of Mia's family, and then for the loss of Mia, without anyone to help him through it and then was thrust into the spotlight with his band's meteoric rise.  Being recognized and mobbed by fans and paparazzi, being misaligned in the gossip magazines, hounded by the media, and having jealous bandmates, was all too much for someone who had yet to heal from tragic loss.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|The story content is a bit esoteric and underlying vision development requires patience on the part of the viewer but the performances are unworldly.  The 3D cinematography was spot on as you would expect from Cirque.  I'd give it 5 stars except for the short length.  I did have trouble, as did other reviewers, with getting it to work on any of my DVD players - 2D or 3D.  Even the third copy sent only works on my 3D player though Sony proclaims it can be played in 2D.  Perhaps, they meant it can be played in 2D mode on a 3D player.  Anyway, If I could give 10 stars to Amazon Customer Service I would.  They replaced the first two defective discs by overnight delivery no questions asked.  Kudos to the best customer service department of any out there.  I usually place my orders with Amazon direct even though their price may be a little higher than that offered by other sites.  The experience with this affirms that choice.  Thank you Amazon!
B002SF9YYI|5.0|I lived through Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music's heyday from the seventies onwards. Some of the songs show their age, as do the videos, but the great majority show how inventive, original and bold an artist Ferry was and is. The video for Limbo quite literally still knocks my socks off (Australian expression). The video for Let's Stick Together is a classic. A pity the video does not appear to have been digitally remastered in some instances. However the collection of songs are outstanding. Whoever directed the videos such as Limbo and Don't Stop the Dance, for example, also deserves a gong. The women featuring, despite the 80s clothes, hairstyles and dance moves, are stunning. It certainly got my heart started. A reminder of what remarkable artists Ferry and his colaborators including Brian Eno were and are, when artists lived up to the title and were innovative, imaginative and truly original rather than resorting to off-screen and off-mike outrageous and appalling behaviour to maintain public interest. Ferry reminds us what it truly takes to 'make it' and be a genuine star. Sorry about the epistle but I like to compare what we have now to what we had then - perhaps I'm just getting old....
0894803123|3.0|The short history of Ben & Jerry's at the start of the book is fun to read.  The recipe selection leaves something to be desired.  The vanilla ice cream recipe is easy to make but not nearly as good as a custard-based recipe.  There's no discussion at all (in fact, the book sort of contemptuously dismisses) of low-cal substitutes for cane sugar such as Splenda, agave, stevia, etc.  So if you don't mind blimping up, the recipe selection is fine.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|I love this album regardless of what you think of Eminem Its the perfect mesh of Old and New style Eminem Rapping and Hes joined by the very talented Royce Da 5'9.

0439023513|4.0|Katniss Everdeen has had more to do with the uprising then she ever expected. A chess piece in one giant game where someone else is moving the piece for her, making the move without her even knowing.   Her home is gone, everything she had has been completely destroyed after she was pulled from the  Quarter Quell. Gale is safe, back at district 13, that does in fact exist and is, interestingly enough, thriving. Even if there's strict rules and rations; its better then the piles of ash and stink of decay back at 12.   Her family is safe; Prim and her mother are working at the hospital at 13. The only one she's unsure about is Peeta. The capital took him, but there's no telling if he's even alive anymore.   Until he's broadcast on TV, telling everyone to cease fire. Telling Katniss she needs to think about what she is doing and why. More confused then ever, she must decide whom to trust and if shes willing to be the rebels pawn.   13 gets Peeta back... but something's wrong, he isn't who he used to be. Hijacked. Its up to the Mocking Jay to finally step forward and take the role she accidentally cast upon herself.  Thousands will be killed in the process, homes destroyed, all in an attempt to win control over the people who have destroyed lives for generations...  Will Katniss finally have to choose between Gale and Peeta? Or will the cause she's fighting for get her, or one of them, killed in the process?     I felt like this one was a bit rushed. Like going from point A to C, and don't know what happened to get there. I did enjoy it though, just thought it would be better, and that it would be more descriptive.... Instead of being half a book of fighting, then bam, your done with the book and 467324 different things have happened and you don't know how you got there! that's how I felt anyways...

0439023521|5.0|Katniss, is a young girl with a fierce attitude and a deviance of the strict laws of her world. She lives in the poor community of District 12, a district of Panem; a community of coal miners where fatalities and starvation are normal life.  Her mothers of no help since the death of her father, so feeding the family is left to Katniss. Her father used to take her to the woods, beyond the chained link fence that kept predators out of the city or the people chained in, where he would teach her to hunt with a bow and arrow to bring home supper every night.She learned To set up traps and find wild herbs for her mothers medicine and remedies for the poor community. And while she knows shes doing what she has to to keep her family alive, she always knows it highly illegal. While out in the woods she meets Gale, a boy a few years older whom is quite like Katniss. Out in the woods, defying the capitol and the Peacemakers rules of staying on the other side of the fence, all to feed his family. They become friends over the course of a few months and begin trading their knowledge of the forest their kills to trade at the Hob.  Worse then the gnawing hunger that never seems to subdue in her stomach, is the knowledge of the Hunger Games. The games all began when the rebellion started years ago and the people of District 13 tried to fight back against the Capitol. Of course the Capitol won, with their money and high tech killing machines and mutated animals to fight back the rebels. So the Capitol devised a game in which, starting at the age of twelve till eighteen, every child most put his or her name in the drawing. All twelve districts had to do this to ensure no one forgot the rebellion. A boy and a girl are chosen from each district, to all be thrown into some horrible arena to fight till the death while everyone in Panem is forced to watch. Only one person can remain standing to win The Hunger Games. That is, until Katniss plays the game.

0439023491|5.0|Katniss and Peeta have returned to District 12 after winning the  Hunger Games and get the pleasure of living in Victor's Village. They, along with Hamish, get to live in luxury homes, with all the food they can imagine; something Katniss dreamed about her whole life. But, as Katniss quickly realizes, its not all as wonderful as she thought. She's lost Gale and Peeta as friends, and finds she doesn't know what to do with herself now that she no longer has to provide for her family. So she begins to travel into the woods again to hunt for food for Gales familyand Even do some trading at the hob. But even that has to come to an end when a new lead Peacekeeper is in town. It seems like he's doing everything to try to catch her doing something wrong; like turning on the electric fence while she's in the woods, but clever Katniss dodges that one.<br />An unexpected, never heard of, visit from President Snow, sets her life right back into turmoil. She's causing an uproar in the other districts, and has to prove to the President that she loves Peeta, and stop the havoc in the surrounding districts.<br />After all she has suffered, is still suffering from the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself in an even worse predicament. The 75th annual Quell Hunger Games is about to begin.... All remaining previous winners must compete again, amongst each other. So this time she has a plan; without a doubt, keep Peeta alive till the end. Sacrificing herself this time and allowing Peeta the chance to do something amazing. Use his voice and clever words, to start an uprising in every district and over run the capitol when the games are over.<br /><br />When its down to the final few, shes pulled from the arena.......<br />Something monumental is about to happen...<br /><br />Once again, Suzanne Collins will captivate you in her fight or flight Hunger Games series.
B001BW02B8|5.0|Was a fan of Songs About Jane and got this after hearing If \\"I Never See Your Face Again\\" on the radio. Put it away shortly thereafter. A few good songs, but it didn't connect with me.    Recently rediscovered it and it is now my favorite Maroon 5 album. I think it's held up better than Songs About Jane. A lot more depth than I originally gave it credit for. Nice ballads, like Infatuation, but also some great rock songs. Love that this version has the version of \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" with Rhianna, which I think is excellent.
B004IH0TS4|4.0|Plunge into Rick Riordan's fantastic world filled with Greek Mythology, scary monsters, and some crazy adventures!    Percy Jackson, typical teenage boy....that is, until he finds out he's a Demi-God. In the course of a day Percys whole world is thrown upside down. This story blends mythology with the troubles of a young boy trying to find his way in the world. (Or at least trying not to get kicked out of another school!) You see, something bad happens at every school Percy has attended, and its not like its his fault (what with all the monsters trying to kill him).Weird situations start happening to Percy, (like his teacher turning into a flying monster and trying to kill him!) Then he finds out who he truly is, who his father is, and that Greek Mythology really does exist in the real world. (Well the world hes about to be thrown into anyway!)He makes some pretty spectacular friends throughout his journey, and some scary enemies.  His best friends a Satyr, whos there to protect Percy and help him along his journey. His teacher is a centaur, and his dads Poseidon. This series has it all ladies and gents! Great action and fighting, love and friendship, the bound of family, and a fantasy world.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was wonderful! The cinematography was beautiful. I especially loved the shots filmed through the pipeline as she surfed and the scenes shot looking up through the surface of the water. I scuba dive and love to look up through the water. It adds dimension and energy to the scenes. The special effects were just awesome. The actress really looks like her arm is missing. Just incredible. The acting was top-notch. It is everything I am looking for in a good movie. Drama, warmth, realism, up-lifting. This young girl is a real inspiration. There are those who might not want to watch because the message is overtly Christian, but I would ask the question, \\"Have you seen the movie, Ghandi? Or Seven Years in Tibet?\\" Did you avoid them because they were overtly about their religious beliefs? Watch with an open mind and be inspired by this young girl and the God who gave Bethany such courage and perseverance.
1416550550|4.0|Nell had a great life, an adoring father, younger sisters who watched her every move, and an overall great up bringing.   But everything goes down hill on her 21st birthday when her father comes to talk to her....about where she really came from. Her father found her on the docks, fresh off a boat from across the sea. Being the whorf master, it's his responsibility to attend to lost luggage and the like. So he is startled to find a 4 year old little girl all by herself, her only items being a few nick knacks in a white suit case she carries with her. Hugh tries to get the little girls information, name, where she's from, where are her parents. But to his disbelief, she claims to not know her own name, but that she is supposed to meet her parents here. Hugh has no other choice, he must look after this young child, and his wife agrees. So while the years fall by, this lost child is given a new name, Nell, and quickly adapts to her new life with her loving parents.  But when her father breaks this news to her she stops speaking to her family and breaks off her previous upcoming marriage.   Because of the news that destroyed her life, Nell becomes pretty anti social, lost in her own thought of the mystery of her life. Later on she remarries and has a child of her own, Lesley. Their relationship is pretty rocky and they don't get along much. So after Lesley leaves, Nell decides its time to find out who she really is.  Just when Nell is getting close to the truth, theirs an unexpected visit from Lesley and her child, Cassandra. Lesley needs her mom to look after Cassandra. So Nell's life is put on hold while she raises another child. After Nell passes, Cassandra is left with  all of her possessions. Including a mystery cottage in England. Now the puzzle of who \\"Nell\\" really is, rest on Cassandra's shoulders.     This book caught my eye because the title reminded me so much of The Secret Garden.   The book changes from different points of views and different time periods with every chapter.  From the 1900's to 2005, The forgotten garden is about the mystery of a young girls origins.  This book will make you want to find out everything you can about your own family history!   I found I liked reading from the points of view and time period in the 1900's a lot better then when it was in Cassandra's point of view in the 2000's.  If you like older time periods, mystery, love, hope, family history, this is a great read for you.  It was hard to get into at the first few chapters, but after that I was hooked and just had to find out who Nell was! Throughout the book you'll be trying to figure out the mystery, but, more then likely, you still wont solve it right! I know I was completely shocked when I finished it!   Its 549 pages of a family's dark secrets, and a mystery that will break your heart.
0517543052|5.0|I remember in the early 70s when I bought my first copy of Be Here Now.I was overwhelmed.Here at last was an actual account of spirituality that made perfect sense,that was not based on antiquated superstitions and contradictions.I had searched most religious denominations in my youth, but never felt they realy had what I wanted. The real truth about life. Not a bunch of people madly in love with their own egos, accompanied by services that relied on superstition so nobody would have to look at themselves and which frequently had degenerated into a social gathering and nothing more.Be Here Now by Ram Das changed my life.Through Ram Das I was able to find my beloved Guru Paramahansa Yogananda.This book is for those who are not satisfied with antiquated superstitions, and want the truth, even though it may require a good look at oneself.This book is designed for both the novice, serious student, and accomplished yogi. This book is a must, if you want God to become part of your daily life.Om Tat Sat.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout for 20 minutes but I haven't lost any weight from it. It is pretty intense until you get used to it, my soccer playing husband even says it's hard! I have definitely gained muscle and have more definition from it but being 5'2'' and 115lbs I was hoping that between this, walking regularly, and eating 1200 calories that I would be down a couple lbs by now (I'm on day 20) and thats not the case. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend the workout to anyone but don't buy it solely to lose the 20 lbs as suggested on the cover. You will have to do far more than this DVD to do that.
0307405095|5.0|For those of you who like big bold beautiful pictures and amazing tasting pies, this is a must. Others have already described the book in detail, so i'll say make the Sour Cherry pie... I haven't had one in so long and this one comes out looking beautiful and tasting delicious. Homemade is always best. The Cherry almond galette is really nice also and the chocolate espresso tart is for those with a little extra cash and a more sophisticated palate. The Frangipane Apricot tart is also a must. Instead of vanilla I used almond extract and it made this dessert extra extrodinary. It is creamy, delicate and very flavorful. Martha says to serve it right away, but I refrigerated it over night and the flavors came together even more so. The blueberry pie and apricot hand pies are also really nice. And for the Pate Brisee and Pate Sucree in this book, you can not go wrong. The brisee is really flakey when done right. Took me several trys but i've got it.     There's something for everyone (time to get more pie plates) :D. And the ingredients are so easy to combine. So far these are what i've tried and my family has enjoyed them, highly. This book is not the same as her first pie book. There is more of a variety of filling, unlike her first which is mostly fruit.. A great book from a great teacher. I'm ready to bake more pies...    Note: The instructions for the Frangipane Apricot Tart are not totally complete and the cooking time is a bit off. When you get to the cream part, the instructions are: beat the confect. sugar and vanilla til soft peaks form. They forgot to mention the heavy cream. Add it and all will be well, I promise. Then fold in the creme fraiche or sour cream, which worked wonderfully for me. And the tart needed more time to bake and set. You will love this tart.    ENJOY!
0767903862|5.0|I've both read the book and listened to the audio-book (the audio multiple times), and was so intrigued I went to Sydney the year after. Still every time I see the book or hear the audio, I feel like going back. Superb writing, very informative, and perfectly entertaining.
0515149489|5.0|I'm a great fan of all of Nora Robert's books the latest I've read has been The Search.  Nora has such a wonderful way of bringing the reader into the story and fulfilling h er promise for a \\"good read\\".<br />The Search is no exception. Fiona Bristol is a wonderful character who comes across as a strong and capable woman who is being terrorized by a serial killer who trained a surrogate killer to kill for  him while he is in prison servicing a life sentence. It's chilling and yet on the other hand it's a love story, Fiona meets Simon who has a cute puppy named Jaws that has a case of puppy shinnaigins such as eating Simon's socks etc. Fiona has a rescue service and teaches animal rescue techniques as well as training a rescue team for search and rescue. It's action packed and I read it almost in one sitting. I hope my novel \\"Without Consent\\" by Virginia Degner, coming out in 2011, will be as much fun for readers as this one was.
1400052181|5.0|This book is mesmerizing and difficult to put down....what a rare combination of scientific, very technical information combined with a personal glimpse into the life of the subject and her family. It takes the reader all the way through a time of remarkable change and scientific discovery secondary to the non authorized use of an unempowered patient's cells. The social justice issues alone make it worth the read. The personal story connects it to the humanity in a way that becomes part of who you are...or want to be.
B004WKI204|4.0|Pure Tina Fey gold. Loved it, can't remember laughing so hard reading a book. It's worth noting that the book is oddly structured, which I think was done deliberately. It is not your conventional memoir: It comprises of sketches of Fey's childhood memories, accounts of her professional success, admissions of parenting dilemmas and hilarious self help tips. The authorial voice is the one Fey carries throughout SNL and 30 Rock; witty, caring, snappy &<br /> self-depreciating most of the times. Love her in-your-face comments on gender equity at work and brutal honesty on motherhood (and breastfeeding). Finally, Tina Fey is a feminist AND funny as hell, but who would have thought that makes a hit-selling combo? Well Tina Fey is here to show you the way. I should add that the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would have liked for it to be much longer!
1439153663|3.0|Reading this book as a writer really taught me quite a bit.  The book is substantial - many words, but the language is such that it should be told to you.  If I were reading this book, I would have gotten caught up on the *show don't tell* aspect of the writing, but because I was being told, a difference was made in my perception. So if you didn't enjoy it after reading it, give the audiobook a try.  Im not saying you'd give it 5 stars, just that maybe you'd increase the rating by a star or two.  As for the book itself - the balance was a bit difficult.  There was a great deal of interesting story - white indentured servant has a black slave family, but the plots took their time, and I must say, that this was the first book I got tired of listening to.  At a little more than half the book, I started to dislike Lavinia.  Can you really have no common sense whatsoever when it comes to your abusive husband?  Why is it someone else's job to get you out of the mess you made yourself.  I suppose we can chalk the whining and poor decisions up to the foolishness of a teenager, but I tell you, I was very ready for her to grow up and get some sense.  I have disliked books before, but Ive never gotten tired of the protagonist, that was new.    I enjoyed the characters of Mama Mae, Papa George and Will Stevens.  Even though they were 2 dimensional, I liked them enough to be able to imagine what that 3rd dimension might be. All of the other characters - even Belle, was just boring and flat - we don't even get to know anything about Lavinia's daughter.  She just may as well have not been there.    There was a lot of death in this book, but because we have so little invested in the characters - it was *ok* for lack of a better term.  I just couldn't wait for it to be over.  The ending was also something of a let down, it just didn't really make any sense to me, but I guess the decision on the ending is your own opinion.  That's what's so wonderful about books.    I would recommendthis for winter reading. It definitely isn't a light and airy read or listen!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|If you have not heard of Pink Martini you are missing out on a cultural, musical phenomenal experience! I now own all 5 of their CDs. They sing in French, Italian, English, Spanish - I think. They are FABULOUS!
B0046ECFRM|4.0|First of all, the Kindle version of this book is a bit annoying---mostly just because there are never any quotation marks around a quote that introduces a chapter.    Also, there were some grammar issues in here, and I don't think it's simply because it was a Kindle version. It's more like Stephanie Perkins would write, \\"____ and me\\" when it was supposed to be \\"_____ and I.\\" Not only that, but you should never write, \\"____ and me,\\" but rather \\"me and _____,\\" which she also didn't do. I'm not sure if that was done on purpose so as to make the narrator seem more like a teenager who doesn't use correct grammar all of the time (although most intelligent teenagers---and I can tell that Perkins wants Anna to be one of these said intelligent teenagers----do use correct grammar) or if Perkins just can't write very well.       The story was cute and charming, albiet very predictable (***SPOILER ALERT: I mean, the whole Bridgette and Toph thing? Yeah, I knew that would happen from the moment when Toph asked if Bridgette could be in his band. Or maybe even before that...). I did, however, enjoy the characters, and found the conversations between Anna and St. Claire to be very sincere, although I wish I could've gotten to know Mer more. I thought she would be a very important character because she was the first person who Anna met at the beginning of the book, but she ended up being flat.     Overall, though, I did like it because, as aforementioned, the story is charming and sincere. It's a cute read---something good if you're looking for a very light read or beach read.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|To say the truth, I had no idea of who she is on the cover of the CD and what kind of songs she sings. The reason I bought it just because of adding the amount of money required by Free two day delivering. But as soon as I listen to it, I am absorbed into its melody. How beautiful those songs are, especially Rolling in the Deep, Don't You Remember, Set Fire to the Rain and Someone Like You! How unique the sound is, but how appropriate it is to those love blue songs. I quickly search the web for any information about the pop singer Adele Adkins. For me, the day I received the CD is worthy of remembering. I highly recommend this CD.
B001TOD92C|3.0|My husband enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was cheezy and fell asleep during it. Definitely more a a guy's flick.
0439023521|2.0|I find myself at a loss to explain why so many people like this book so much. The premise sounds interesting enough, but it has been done before, is practically cliche in Japanese media, and Collins has not done it well.    The book is boring. Most of the first third is made of infodumps. They're not even well-executed infodumps. The writing style is simple and straightforward. Such a style can be fantastic when done right, but in this case it (with the exception of a few nonetheless forgettable passages) has no elegance or flavor; it's just plain boring, and it is incapable of rendering the infodumps anything more than snooze-inducing.    The plot is very predictable, and the author throws in a couple of plot twists that, rather than ramping up the tension, excitement, character development, or any of that, slaughter what little tension the plot possessed. They are deus ex machinas that save the main character from having to make the tough decisions one would expect from a book with this premise.    And the main character never has to make any truly tough decisions. She is never conflicted by anything except the book's contrived love triangle. Even when she is forced to kill, she feels little to no remorse. She just spends a sentence or two thinking about it with no particular emotion, and then forgets about it for the rest of the book. The author never lets her kill preemptively, only allowing her to act in self-defense, and her opponents are so poorly developed that the reader has no real reason to care about them.    The main character does not act consistently her age. At the beginning of the book, she acts in a reasonable manner for a sixteen year old subjected to poverty. But later in the book she seems more like a ten year old, both in the way she acts and in the way she is described (she apparently looks like a \\"little girl\\" in one particular dress, which is quite a feat considering her age). At almost the same time, she acts like some sort of hardened veteran in her utter unflappability.    All the characters are unflappable. For goodness sake, even the twelve-year old is unflappable. Where is all the emotional distress that should result from the threat of death and the necessity of killing innocents? From being suddenly and forcefully separated from family and friends? From being constantly monitored, starved, and injured?    Despite the book's unbelievability, predictability, and general terribleness, the second and third thirds of the book are admittedly somewhat entertaining. But still, I found myself skipping over large chunks of boring text even in the middle of the best of the action scenes. And the very best part of the book, the only part in which we are shown a relationship that feels relatively real, is all too brief. The mockingjays are cool, though.    I notice that many of the bafflingly few other low reviews cite the book's disturbingness as a reason for their low rating of it. I disagree with these people; this book needs to be more disturbing, not less. There's violence, but it is hardly graphic, and it happens to people the reader knows little to nothing about. This premise has so much potential for emotional turmoil, horror, and difficult decisions, but the book completely fails to deal with any of that and is presented in a sparkling clean and bloodless (and lifeless) manner. I actually find is disturbing how the book glosses over what should be a horrific situation.    In short, I have no bloody idea why people like this book so much. It's derivative, predictable, poorly written rubbish.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I only bought this movie because I love Rachael McAdams.  I would say this is not one of her best movies, but I still liked it and will probably watch it again.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Wow. Just wow.  The ending combined cast songs of Bring Him Home and One Day More are worth the price in and of themselves.    Then again the quality of the performance itself, the video quality, and DTS-HD MA sound makes this one of the most priceless masterworks ever.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Wow this movie sure gets your \\"thinkers\\" into motion.  I still sometimes think about certain scenes from this movie.  Definitely not a good first-date movie and not a good choice for people who don't like dark backgrounds.  I think there was only one brief scene outdoors and the rest is in dimly lit buildings.      I definitely recommend watching this movie twice.  The first time I was borderline completely lost.  The second time made a lot more sense.
0060558121|5.0|American Gods by Neil by Gaiman is a strange mix of reality and fantasy that twist together to tell the tale of a man named Shadow.  On leaving prison he is confronted with events that constantly coil loyalty with betrayal, old with new and good with evil as he travels among the ancient gods and is drawn into their conflict with the new techno gods of America.  It is a strange tale without being a dark one, mainly because the character of Shadow is so uniquely honest.  The unpredictability of the gods creates an edgy balance between curiosity and suspense and never fails to surprise. The narrative is smooth and the descriptive backgrounds, splendid.  A wonderful read, intelligent, informative and entertaining.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever!  Rachael McAdams is absolutely wonderful in this.  This is the first movie I saw her in and immediately fell in love with her.  I usually don't like love stories, but this one I totally do! I've watched this movie over 5 times and will watch it again for sure.
B0039UTDA6|4.0|I couldn't think of a better title for these series. It provides not only amazing footage of all sorts of animal species but also about the interaction between all forms of Life.  For me, \\"insects\\" as well as \\"plants\\" were among the best and most interesting ones.
0765356139|4.0|After the spectacular [[ASIN:0765350386 book 1]] of the Mistborn trilogy, I was expecting a lot from this one.  While parts of this second book met those expectations, I was frustratingly disappointed during much of it.  The almost-pointless political squabbles, the lack of real-feeling danger, the absence of Kelsier, and the slow pace, meant that the first 400 pages of this book fall way short of the mark set by its predecessor.  The complete absence of a strong and central antagonist left much of the book feeling unimportant, and unexplained but frequent appearances by some mysterious mist creature eventually became just annoying.  If Sanderson could have found a way to condense the first three quarters of this book into one quarter, the whole would have benefited.  Still, the writing quality continues to be excellent, the characters are still good, and the story as a whole kept my attention.<br /><br />One of the things I had thought so great about the Mistborn series was the originality and very strict limitations to the magic system of Allomancy.  This was a well defined and structured system where things made sense in an almost scientific way, not some all-powerful magic system that the hero just had to master to save the world.  Unfortunately, in book 2, Vin's allomantic powers almost take on that level.  First, with the discovery of duralumin, she is able to vastly expand her allomantic powers, making her seriously unstoppable.  Then, later in the book, she discovers that somehow allomancy can be used to control various unnatural creatures in the world.  Unfortunately, Sanderson didn't make the same effort to explain and limit this new power, allowing allomancy to become something less by becoming something more.  Maybe I'm being too critical here, and maybe Sanderson had good reasons for going this route, but I couldn't help being irritated at the unneeded expansion and exaggeration of such a creatively well-defined system of magic.<br /><br />All that being said, however, this continues to be a great series, and even this second book had its moments.  The last 200 pages were fantastic, bringing the pace back up to book 1 levels, and a couple of late surprises keep the reader guessing about the final outcome.  This book also does a fine job of fleshing out some great characters from book 1, most notably Sazed and Breeze, but also Cett, Straff, and Spook.  The continuing story of Eland and Vin's growing love and maturity is well done here, and the set up for the [[ASIN:0765356147 next book]] makes me want to go out and buy it immediately.  Also, Sanderson took the time to more fully define the uses and limitations of Feruchemy.  As Sazed becomes more central to the story, his abilities are really shown off here.  Really part of the same great magic system as Allomancy, Feruchemy has amazing potential, seems strictly defined, and helps earn the Mistborn series top marks for originality.  Also like the first book, this one was careful to keep the mythology and context of the story in focus.  Each chapter starts with an excerpt from an ancient prophetic text, giving tantalizing clues about where the book is going and what it will all add up to.<br /><br />In short, I couldn't help feeling disappointed with this book, but that is largely due to my extremely high expectations of Brandon Sanderson.  Still highly recommended.this continues to be a great series, and even this second book had its moments.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Great adaptation of the Gaskell novel. Very interesting romantic leads and a great window into the class differences of the time. Margaret Hale is a wonderful protagonist. Wonderful production value, acting, and scoring.  This Masterpiece Classic is right up there with Pride and Prejudice, Bleak House, and Cranford for me.
B004RBYJVO|4.0|Chris' story is both interesting and inspirational.  Krakauer's writing is journalistic in it's approach, making the experience of reading the book even more real.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I've been a fan of John Locke's for a long, long, time and I've never bought a single book of his until now. John came onto my radar long before the buzz about him and his success started showing up in articles. You see I watch the Amazon Top 100 like a hawk. I've been impressed with how self-published authors have been doing something that few traditionally published authors can accomplish - that is make a living wage through writing. I love authors...no other group of people struggle so hard doing something they love...usually for so little other than disappointment and degradation. The fact that my husband is an author, and largely through efforts of my own, became a success has led me to do what I can to give back to the writing community by sharing what I've learned both through my blog and free seminars I give on the business side of writing.    When I first noticed John, Amanda Hocking was \\"all the buzz\\" but I was watching him...closely...as I saw him getting book after book not only in the top 100 but in the top 20, then top 10. I knew he would be the first indie published author to hit #1. And of course he did.    When I bought this book, I expected to be disappointed.  After all, I knew the secret to John's success. He wrote a lot of \\"good books\\" very quickly, priced them at $0.99 and rode the ebook publishing wave that occurred in October/November 2010. I experienced firsthand a similar explosion in sales as my husband's The Riyria Revelations ([[ASIN:0979621135 The Crown Conspiracy: The Riyria Revelations]]) went from 1,000 books sold a month to over 10,000. So I went into this book expecting to see what I already knew...boy was I wrong.    I want to personally thank John for expressing in such a succinct way, something that will truly help a demographic of people I love. This book will be a top seller, even though its market is very small. It will do so because it is filled with gems, insights, and no nonsense recommendations that is a true \\"Pay it Forward\\" for all struggling authors.  In conclusion, I'd just like to say that my husband Michael has been writing blog posts like those John discusses, without realizing what they were, or why they were important.  If you are reading this John, and I know you are.  Here are two blogs that I particularly liked that he wrote.   Ad them to your collection of meaningful blogs. They can be found on Michael's Riyria Blog:    - 1/15/2009: In the beginning  - 4/18/2011: Song of bias and prejudice     If you are an author, looking to do the impossible...writing what you love and making a living buy this book. Read it. Do what it says. There is wisdom here beyond measure and I cannot recommend it enough.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I found myself completely immersed in Jane Austen's Persuasion. It was a book that I could not put down for I did not want to leave the fascinating world that Ms. Austen has created.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|It pains me to have a negative review when it comes to Harry Potter, but this is over the disc and not the movie.  I love the series and would love to be able to watch it again!  Here is the problem.  When I first received this movie, I was able to watch the BlueRay a total of two times before it would stop after the intro.  The third watching attempt was a few days past 30 days and it would stick with no option to get to the movie.  The DVD version plays just fine.  After a little struggle, Amazon made a one time exception and replaced it.  Now, after receiving it and deciding to watch it again I am encountering the same thing.  This time I am SOL. I have a top of the line Sony BlueRay and have never had any other issue, so I know it is not my player.  Maybe they were given a bad batch from WB?  Did anyone else have this issue too?
0307272702|5.0|Summary: Written by a professional writer, it reads like a novel packed with many interesting details and historical data. Not a dry tome on a boring subject. Well worth the purchase if you are interested in why people (or you) are fat and what can be done about it successfully.  ----  Seems like I've gotten lucky on books the last month or two. This book could easily have been a dry boring work on what makes you fat or not fat but it was, instead, an interesting and well written book that stayed with laymen language almost entirely.  To be clear, it reads very much like an interesting novel. You're considering it since you're reading the reviews about it so let me put your mind at ease. This is not a clinical tome written by one scientist for other scientists nor is it multi-page infomercial peddling the latest fad.  You'll find some extraordinary information throughout the book. You'll be amazed and, frankly, probably angry within a short time.  This book absolutely refutes the common dogma today that passes for weight control science. As the author freely admits, what he is showing you is not new information, indeed, it has been around for hundreds of years!  I titled this review as a vindication for Dr. Atkins because his approach suffered an all out assault by the 'experts'. They were/are wrong. He was/is correct.  You'll hate this book if you are someone that cannot get your head around being mislead by the experts and by the united front that they present for facts - dietary or otherwise. Although Mr. Taubes has carefully footnoted his work if you cannot crack the cover with an open mind then you should spend your money elsewhere.  My personal experience - about 15 years ago I tried the Atkins diet. Wow! I dropped about 20 pounds before you could blink. It was amazing. I was never hungry. Not being very overweight in the first place I strayed from the diet. Now a days I find I've gained quite a bit and unlike yesteryear it is much harder not gaining weight. I've been wrestling with this problem for the past couple of years - I'd forgotten about the experience I had with Atkins.  Now I am recharged. I've been steadily eating up all the high carb stuff and not buying stuff like that at the store. If the economy wasn't in the crapper I'd just toss that junk so I could get started losing weight. But, heh, money is tight at the moment and I know I will be loosing weight soon enough.  In short, this is a well documented, eye opening book that will change your life forever. I bet you've never heard about most of the information covered. Moderate your carbs in an informed way and, with few exceptions, you can be whatever weight you want to be.  ----edit December 4th 2011 -----  So. I had started LowCarb (LC) and then had some family crisis that knocked me off course. I officially (re)started following a low-carb lifestyle on Aug 13th 2011. I weighed 265.4 pounds. Today I weigh 227.6 pounds. I plan on dropping another 30 to 35 pounds before I start maintaining my weight instead of loosing weight. According to the site where I do my food log and weight logs I should be under 200 by the first week in March of 2012.  Man. I like the skinnier and getting skinnier all the time me.  ---end edit ------
B004YKB52O|5.0|Having released only one proper full length studio album between 2004 and 2011 (that being 2008's so-so self-titled album), Simple Plan is not exactly the most prolific band out there. But they have returned in 2011 with \\"Get Your Heart On\\" and it is their best album yet.<br /><br />Quite simply put, the album's ballads (most notably \\"Astronaut\\") are fantastic, and the rockers are more focused, falling back on effortlessly catchy three-chord power pop and pop punk hooks. This album would have been the perfect follow-up to 2004's \\"Still Not Getting Any\\" because it improves and slightly expands on that album. Pierre Bouvier's vocals never sounded better, and they are boosted even more by excellent guest spots by Alex Gaskarth (All Time Low), Rivers Cuomo (Weezer), and Natasha Bedingfield.<br /><br />Part of the reason for this improvement, I think, is the fact that the band appears to be coming to terms with their sound. Their attempts to \\"expand\\" artistically on their 2008 release resulted in a mixed bag, because the professional songwriters that Simple Plan hired back then made them sound like a totally different band at times. So as a fan of their 2002 debut and also their 2004 album, I was not sure which direction they would go here. But as pop punk-tinged rocker and album opener \\"You Suck At Love\\" proves, they have returned to (and perfected) their form here.<br /><br />In closing, it is hard to believe that Simple Plan has been around for a decade already. In that sense, they are aging quite gracefully, and actually a release like this could prolong the band's shelf life for years. Not only will these songs sound great in their live sets, they will be perhaps the best material in their live shows. A natural progression in albums is expected from a band, but the amount of improvement from the previous album to this one is not only refreshing, but it is stunning and totally unexpected. This album is packed with more potential singles than a Florida night club.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I absolutly Love this Album and this band!!!! It was incredible to hear all the songs on the album!

This album is definately something all MCR fans should have.

In the fight scene I thought that knife looked familiar.  I have the exact same knife.  $3.00 on sale at Big 5!  LOL!

0316056863|3.0|This was a book which I just picked up because I saw it on a few bestseller lists. I'm not a huge Tina Fey fan (I loved her on SNL but don't watch 30 Rock) and didn't think she had some amazing story to tell which would make me feel like I connected with her on a deeper level. I just wanted an easy read and something that was semi-lighthearted. On all those fronts, I wasn't disappointed.    She definitely shows her writing prowess with all of the anecdotes that are present in the book. I found myself smiling and laughing throughout the entire time (with the exception of The Mother's Prayer for Its Daughter chapter, which seemed more like filler). And her personality easily shines through.    But with that said, I also picked up Kathy Griffin's memoir with the same intent and was completely blown away with the depth and honestly she wrote with (and of course, it was hilarious on top of that). And Jerry Weintraub's memoirs weren't as funny but he definitely gave you a larger sense of who he is as a person with the amount of detail that he went into. Compared to those two, I felt like this book was a little hollow.    So, it's not too deep, too preachy or too insightful but I guess that wasn't supposed to be the premise. I just wish that it had ended up being a little more than what it was.
B004WJRJUE|5.0|This is THE reissue of the year. Finally, someone got it right. I'm so damn tired of great albums being ruined by lousy remastering. No overly compressed brickwalled crap here, this is the real deal. This is the best this album has ever sounded. I've owned the original UK Secret Records release on vinyl for thirty years, and this sounds even better than that. All of the original elements have been restored and mixed to perfection. Gone are those wimpy electronic drums that replaced the original drum tracks on the mid-80's Atlantic reissue. The bass level is back where it belongs. That thin, tinny production has been replaced with a full, beefy sound, but it hasn't been overdone. It's just right.    The bonus extras are great too. This rates a 10/10. :headbang:    Even if you think you're not a Twisted Sister fan, you owe it to yourself to check this out.
B00394A4UK|5.0|If you get easily spooked like I do, it's probably a good idea to read the book, when possible, rather than to see the movie. I enjoyed this book on so many levels. Each time a plot turned many possibilities of what was happening and what would happen unfolded in my mind, making it a mystery at the turn of so many pages; engrossing, suspenseful, funny. You can't easily takes  clues from the moment and see how they might unfold.
B004XJ7HSM|2.0|Matt Damon should stick with action/thriller movies.  I'm trying to figure out what this movie is.  What it is not is action/thriller, science fiction, magical/hokus-pokus, or interesting.  Even the recruitment of Emily Blunt can't save this movie.  The story is way out-of-whack.  We're supposed to believe that \\"Elise\\", Emily Blunt's character would take back \\"David Norris\\", Matt Damon's character three times after being left in the lurch by him-the latest being on the verge of marrying her boyfriend.  Even in fiction, this is not good story telling.  This story makes one believe that David Norris is so selfish that he would sacrifice Elise's future life/career path to be with her.  This is where a real gentleman would bow out and leave things alone.  But not Norris.  Even after he is told that there are greater things awaiting him, and that it matters to his future and the future of the country that he leaves Elise alone, he still insists on pursuing her.  The ending of the movie is a disaster of its own.  I am being very generous by giving this movie two stars.  Maybe one would be better.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Help! I can't stop watching this movie! It's fun, incredibly sexy, the actresses are so beautiful  . . . and the chemistry between them feels real and powerful. It also has some pretty memorable dialogue, as in this scene where Peyton's friend Wave is cautioning her about the obvious attraction building between Peyton and Elena:    Wave: I think it's getting a little bit out of control, no? The unbuttoning of the shirt... What about all the eye blazing that goes on between you? I mean, come on. Who does that?   Peyton: Eye blazing? Seriously?   Wave: You're the writer, call it what you want.     I love it!     Seriously hot, funny at times and kind of addicting, this is the lesbian film I have been waiting for.

0811874192|5.0|This is a short review, but in a word, it was PERFECT. I bought three of these books, sight unseen, because of the other reviews. I was not disappointed. The first one I gave to my Mom who was in a particularly difficult stage of chemotherapy. She loves flowers and plants, but hadn't the energy to care for them. So these flowers are on display on the dining room table, and my 81 year old father takes particular delight in changing the display for her every day. I gave another book to my incredibly creative and talented sister-in-law who I felt deserved something just lovely and frivolous. She loved it! She said, \\"It's something I love, but would never buy for myself.\\" The last book will go to my friend in Colorado who has two grandchildren whom she dotes upon. She will love pulling out this book on special occasions to show them the intricacy of the designs. Fabulous, marvelous. Thank you!

B004OKFIYU|5.0|This limited edition of the classic Billy Joel album is not to be missed, even by a casual fan.  Mobile Fidelity has taken the original analog master tapes and reconstructed the sound quality that rivals the best vinyl (note that this album is also available in 180 gram vinyl now).  Always speaking to the middle-class heroes, Joel's 1973 release was an instant hit and the start of an amazing career.  How many people memorized the lyrics to \\"Piano Man\\" or the hilariously, bittersweet song that is \\"Captain Jack\\".  In fact the latter song makes a rousing anthemic closing song.  Nearly all the songs on this album are pop classics.    Note that this SACD is not multi-channel, but stereo.  Oh but what a great, clean, crisp, well-rounded sound it has.  SACD releases like this do not last and end up in the hundreds of dollars when out of print.  But this version is a real keeper.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I received this product extremely quickly and disk one had a slight defect on it and i informed them as soon as i found it and they responded and fixed the problem very quickly this is probably the best service I've had on amazon so far.(also the product itself is awesome)
0374290024|5.0|Sweeping grand unified theory of history. Plausible, will undoubtedly be torn apart by many, but incredibly ambitious and importantly, highly informative and insightful. Also, the author is a lively writer with an eye for a good story.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|First of all, what this book is NOT: it's not a \\"Get Rich In Three Days Whithout Doing Anything\\" or a \\"Publish An Ebook Without Writing A Single Line\\" type of book. This book is NOT about writing a good book or a great book. In fact, it states, right at the start, that the first thing you need is to have written a good book.<br /><br />So, what's it's all about?<br /><br />More than a book about marketing, this book is about the relationship between the writer and the reader, what the writer can do to find the readers who would want to read his or her books. Selling ebooks is important but selling them to the right people is far more important: a reader who has bought a book because it was a bestseller but didn't like it won't buy another book by the same author. And a satisfied reader will want to buy all the books by the same author (or, at last, have a look at them).<br /><br />This book is well written, well constructed, and explains in detail everything a self-published author should do to help his or her book get the success it deserves (if it's worthless, it won't sell, that's all!). And it makes a wonderful reading, too.<br /><br />At the end of August 2012, there's this awful revelation: John Locke bought false reviews for his books. Reviewers could give less than five stars but were paid less. I was not one of these reviewers, I bought the ebook in good faith. Most of my review is still true but, of course, I had to change the title and the number of stars: some of John Locke's advice is good but not enough, even for the author!

1906694176|1.0|This is not about the CONTENT of the book -- I can't wait to read the third of Stieg Larson's Trilogy - it's about the format  . I did not want to read the hardback as it's a somewhat heavy book.<br /><br />So I found a paperback edition.  The acrid smell when I unwrapped the package was overwhelming; I had to leave the book air out outside for a few days.  The print is too small and light.<br /><br />The book too square(7x4x2)  and 746 squat pages -  which makes it impossible to read.  I am sending it back and hope I'll get a refund!

0312383320|5.0|This has got to be the funniest Stephanie Plum adventure I've read so far (and I've read most of them).  I laughed SO MANY TIMES in SO MANY PLACES in the book.  This was pure mind entertainment for me.  A real fun (and funny) book, if you like non-fiction.  Diesel, Carl the Monkey, the Fire Farter and all the other regular characters were such a hoot. I wanted Carl, especially, to come back in her future books.  For escapism, this is Janet Evanovich at her best in my opinion.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fun game (I also own the PC version), but when I was in the middle of a level the second time through adventure mode, I got a calendar alert. When I dismissed that and returned to the game  all it knew was my name. All progress in the game was lost.
B004RLPTT0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to this at work.  I didn't realize they were a bunch of remakes, but it is a very moody soundtrack. I often find myself humming to those at work \\"and if you complain once more....\\" It definitely captures the mood of the movie!

B000HIVOFU|2.0|This SACD is a nice little ditty.  Nice.  Ditty.  Two words that should not apply to any SACD recording.  It's chill.  But not so much for me.  I'm really astounded by the positive reviews here; I got this based on those reviews, seemed like a track list that would be nice and chill, but in reality, it turned out to be an hour filled with nightmare for me.  The performances are very lackluster, very.  Very few on the performers stay on key, and badly enough that it grates.  The high quality of the recording only serves to  highlight these botches all the more.  You could claim it's ad lib, but if it's ad lib, it's ad lib, ad nauseum.  I love 'fever', and when I heard this version I cringed.  The Peggy Lee version leaves this in the dust.  Peggy Lee makes you feel the chills with the singing and the pace.  This version is too slow, and very flat.  Honestly, these reviews make me believe it all the more when I hear that SACD is a format adopted more by people who want to show off than appreciate music, no one with any taste could laud these performances.

159514188X|5.0|I have read many books that deal with tough subjects. They have come in all shapes and sizes, various formats and all dealing with a range of issues. Thirteen Reasons Why, however, is the first one that has left me seriously disturbed... in the best possible way. I have heard all of my life that my actions, words and everything I do have an effect on those around me whether I realize it or not. Honestly, I have never put too much stock into that until I started teaching. When I had a direct, visible impact on those around me- it hit, hard. Seeing that my students valued what I had to say (not only educationally speaking, but also with the advice- big and small- that they asked for) and took it to heart. I learned to be careful quickly.<br /><br />This book has me reevaluating that again. Which is a great thing.<br /><br />Hannah represents so many young people and to know that even her teachers overlooked her makes me reflect hard on this past year. It is no secret that this past school year was a tough year for me. Did I do everything that I needed to do to let my students know that I loved and respected them? Did I show them that in my actions or did I roll my eyes and blow them off? Kinda scary! I loved the double point of view in this novel and how we experienced it just how Clay and the others did. Clay is such a profound character and I completely fell in love with him throughout this novel.<br /><br />Jay Asher has done an amazing job with this novel and I am just so sorry that it has taken me so long to read this. If you haven't read it RUN to your local bookstore and buy it. Then set aside time to read it because you are not going to want to put it down. I hope and pray that it has the same impact on you that it has had on me.

B001OQCV2O|4.0|The programming of this disc seems to be very advanced - you could say it is too advanced. The film plays fine, but the audio commentary track is not compatible with my player, an OPPO BDP-83 SE. I've never seen anything like that before.

B000RHKARO|4.0|Nobody gave me a recording contract to prattle on about my vacation in L.A., but before I go too far--I really like this collection of aural photographs. Sometimes I don't rightly know why. Mayall's voice grates on me somewhat. The songs are kind of limited in that non-progressive way, but the whole thing hangs together in a manner not uncharming. To me the electric guitar of Mick Taylor makes it all worthwhile. Any fires on the program are his. Nice piano, organ, harmonica, tabla, and bass and drums vary the pictures. The first two tracks are very distinctive--the plane, Taylor ripping in, Mayall, and the organ straight into Walking On Sunset--draw one in. This might be the secret to the record--you just stay for the rest of the show. Laurel Canyon Home is a slow blues and 2041 is as rockin' as this album gets. The single version in the bonus cuts is a pounding bit. Ready to Ride, Medicine Man, and The Bear are ones I like also. Miss James lifts off some--nice organ, not much singing--the album could have done with more of this pace. Right place in the sequence too. First Time Alone is kind of a dreamy drone. Thank God they got a really big name to noodle somnambulantly in the background. This may be the most \\"sensitive\\" thing Mayall ever wrote, but it's also the place where some may check out. Long Gone Midnight wakes us up for Fly Tomorrow. Another jam-style platform saved by Taylor's impeccable playing. He lifts it way up before it fades and drifts on out. Stoners forgot to get up and change the record. These aren't Idol or Glee tunes. Mayall wrote some real mood music here and the size and scope of the instrumentation is appropriate. A band like this would keep anybody happy maybe for a while, but everybody was up and out and doing other big things before they could think about doing more together. Oh, well. I've played this and the Blues Alone album more than any of Mayall's other work. Bonus tracks are the aforementioned 2041 and Wish You Were Here. The last one live in Sweden. If I had to travel that far I might have waited 43 years to hear it at the end of this disc.one live in Sweden.

B004XE0P5E|4.0|2nd release from critically hailed Wisconsin singer/songwriter is filled with quietly epic, powerfully<br />  permeating, thoughtful paeans of hope rising from a bleak, desolate existential soundscape<br />  tundra.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|The Review:<br /><br />Green Lantern is Warner Bros' latest attempt to climb back on top of the superhero movie genre (with a character other than Batman).  Their last non-Dark Knight attempt was Superman Returns, and that effort met with mixed results and mixed reviews.  Now comes Green Lantern, guardian of sector 2814.  Does he fair any better than the man of Steel?  Yes, but not nearly so well as Batman or Watchmen.  There are now enough big budget superhero movies that they can be placed in tiers.  In the first tier, we have the best of the best: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Ironman, X-Men: First Class, Thor and Watchmen.  In the second tier there are good movies that fall a little short of greatness, as well as critical acclaim: The Incredible Hulk (Ed Norton Reboot), Blade, Wolverine, and Superman Returns.  Finally, we have failed efforts that are fundamentally poor movies: Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and The Fantastic Four.  Green Lantern fits firmly into that second tier.  It's entertaining, but it will have neither the universal audience appeal of Batman Begins nor its critical acclaim.<br /><br />Green Lantern brings to the silver screen one of the heavy hitters of the DC universe. Hal Jordan is part of a group of galactic peace keepers, each in charge of a sector of space the size of several galaxies.  It's a very big precinct with cosmic threats.  When Jimmy Olsen needs help, he calls Superman.  When Superman needs help, he calls Green Lantern.  The movie's introduction does a splendid job giving the background on the intricacies of the Green Lantern Corps. Notwithstanding the crash course in Green Lantern lore, much of it will be lost on those not at least a little familiar with Green Lantern comics.  This is one of the potential downsides of the film.  On the one hand, those with substantial familiarity with the source material will get the most from the film.  On the other hand those people most familiar with Green Lantern are apt to be critical of the film makers concessions to the medium of film, e.g. there's a lot of nerd rage surrounding Green Lantern's costume.<br /><br />Some fans of the comic have said Green Lantern takes on too much for a single film.  It is not just the origin story of Hal Jordan, played very well by the criminally underrated Ryan Reynolds. It's also about how he has to vanquish two bad guys, while struggling with his green lantern training.  Trying to do so much short changes other aspects of Green Lantern's origin, such as his complex relationship with Sinestro, played by the versatile Mark Strong, who is destined to become Hal's greatest nemesis.  The villains we get in this movie are poor substitutes.  The first, Hector Hammond, while a well developed character, is about as much threat to a Green Lantern as a paper cut. C'mon, he doesn't even rate a cool supervillain code name.  Only Lex Luthor rolls that hard.  The main villain, Parallax, is certainly a galactic threat, but incredibly underdeveloped.  A superhero movie is generally only as good as its supervillain.  Two subpar villains don't make up for the lack of one great villain.<br /><br />Now I didn't think Green Lantern tried to do too much, and I didn't have any trouble following the movie.  But please bare in mind that my head is swimming with such useless facts as the various differences among red, blue, green and gold kryptonite, and how fast Superman would lose his powers under a red sun.  For those of you who didn't dedicate your childhood to the nerdcore equivalent of pondering how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, Green Lantern might seem a little convoluted.<br /><br />But fear not, Green Lantern does do many things right.  Ryan Reynolds is a great Hal Jordan, despite the rantings of innumerable Internet fanboys.  Hal Jordan is a very Marvel-like superhero for DC-at least in his current incarnation.  He's deeply flawed.  A hot headed womanizer who begins as the most irresponsible of squared jawed heroes.  Heis an arrogant fighter jock and he does not play well with others.  Hal has a lot of potential and much of the film revolves around whether he will live up to that potential and overcome his fears and self doubt to become the hero he needs to be. Also, the movie looks fantastic.  The CG aliens are in many cases as expressive as their human costars and I mean that to compliment the FX crew, not knock the actors.<br /><br />In the end, Green Lantern is a fun movie.  It is impossible to take it too seriously and I don't think it's possible to make a Green Lantern Begins along the lines of Batman Begins.  Green Lantern is fundamentally about a guy with a magic ring that can do anything so long as its wearer believes strongly enough.  There's a worthwhile, and largely successful attempt to give Hal Jordan gravitas, but you won't find the social themes of Marvel's X-Men nor the epic struggle of Bruce Wayne to become more than a man.  What you will find is an enjoyable romp, heavy on special FX.  In short, a very watchable second tier superhero movie.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.not play well with others.

0515141429|4.0|Lee Child introduces us to his new he-man hero, Jack Reacher.  Jack is savvy, street smart and tough as nails.  If violence and gore are your thing, here it is!  If a macho hero, able to one-up bad guys at every turn is your thing, here it is.    Child is an excellent writer, able to convey moods, pressures, doubts with well chosen smooth-flowing prose.  The gore, to me, was over the top but I still plan to read the next one in the Reacher series.

1400031524|3.0|I love the Wallander series. As a whole, it is definitely worth reading. This particular book is probably the weakest in the series. It is more like a globe-trotting spy novel than a slow-paced Wallander mystery. The biggest fault of this particular book is the poor translation to english. There are at least a dozen significant translation errors in this edition. At one point in the book, the phrase \\"much muchness\\" occurs ... I still can't figure out Mankell originally wrote there! In short, I encourage all interested readers to read Mankell's mysteries. They are well written and full of complex characters; however, this particular book is not the author's best work, and furthermore, it is poorly translated.

B0034G4ORC|2.0|*minor spoilers, if you could call them that. You'll see 100% of this coming as it unfolds in your living room*<br /><br />First of all, I don't care what critics say prior to watching a movie. I do check them out occasionally after I see one and I can't quite figure out how to articulate all of my thoughts. What I care about is what the users say about movies before I see them. I hope this helps:<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />Long, boring intro to one dimensonal characters who are contrived stereotypes. The kid , possibly too young to serve, certainly too young to die. The grizzled vet , haunted by the demons of his past failures, the young officer who is also a new father...blah, blah, blah. Not only are these people cartoons, you are never given the chance to care about them , even though a fair amount of screen time is dedicated to their introduction.<br /><br />The cliches continue as the film rolls...it's quiet here, too quiet. Oh no, what's that sudden noise? Oh good , it's just a dog. Oh no, we walked single file down the middle of the street with tall buildings on both sides and now we're getting ambushed! (Who could have guessed that creatures advanced enough to have interstellar flight , with superior weapons and vehicles, would also have mastered basic tactics? )<br /><br />This whole movie rolls like a video game, complete with levels, a boss or two and a final push toward the alien stronghold (?) ,which was curiously unguarded for the ultimate value of the target. Guess those aliens worked out tactics but not strategy?<br /><br />Wooden acting. Mostly because the dialogue is weak. I think. It is sometimes hard to tell if these actors are also just not as good as I thought , in the case of Rodriguez and Eckhart .<br /><br />One of the pros, the look of the thing, is also a con in that you always felt that a little more money in the budget would have yielded better looking aliens and allowed for a few more close ups instead of quick panning past the real stars, the aliens.<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />The combat scenes are COOL and fairly intense.I may watch it a second time for those alone. It has that shakey Saving Private Ryan camera work going on at times, and it sorta works. As mentioned above, occasionally I felt like the camera work was more of a \\"we don't have the budget for close, extended scenes showing these aliens, work around it!\\"<br /><br />There are a few scenes showing the aliens behaving liked a trained military force. And you will realize at that time that usually the aliens in movies employ a shoot-everything-that-moves , lay waste to all, while moving freely in the open, unconcerned about opposition. These cats take cover, lay suppressing fire , etc. Again , like a video game.<br /><br />The decision to make the aliens more advanced but not to hopelessly outmatch us, was great and added a lot to the combat sequences.<br /><br />All in all , it's really a 2 1/2 star movie. I think it's just not quite good enough to enjoy on a visual level solely nor is there enough story to easily propel the the movie along between action sequences. Redbox it for a dollar and you're stoked. Borrow from a neighbor/friend and you're happier. 5 bucks at Blockbuster and/or $15 to buy it and I think you're on here tomorrow, writing your own review warning people.are COOL and fairly intense.I may watch it a second time for those alone.

B0018QOIXU|5.0|I listened and fell in love with Adele's latest CD \\"21\\" after, like most people, hearing Rolling In The Deep EVERYWHERE! The CD proved to produce even better songs and I grew more fond with each listen. Because I was such a big fan of \\"21\\" I decided to finally take it out of my car's CD player (after about 2 straight weeks) and put in Adele's debut album, \\"19\\".    I AM SO GLAD I DID! I am a sucker for debut albums and Adele does not disappoint. She displays passion and so much talent singing these simple and timeless pieces. She may not receive 5 star reviews for her lyrics but, to me, this album felt personal, honest and alive. Each song told a story of that love, loss, and heart-ache that everyone has experienced. I hear a voice so strong and honest that the songs cannot contain it. The sound of her voice against 2 or even at times 1 instrument is when she really shines. Songs like Daydreamer, Crazy For You, and Hometown Glory are all soft yet haunting at the same time, I feel like I'm living inside a mood, a moment in time that is totally captivating. Elsewhere she does upbeat, light, and fun just as well on tracks like Cold Shoulder, Tired, Right as Rain and My Same. I am constantly moving my feet and singing along to these songs. Melt My Heart to Stone is emotionally equivalent in power to Someone Like You and leaves me just as convinced that this is the real deal. Adele is it.    I remember hearing Chasing Pavements years back and not thinking much of it. Rolling in The Deep came on twice as strong and I'm thankful it did. In a way I like \\"19\\" even better than \\"21\\". It is like a raw and honest diamond in the rough. These two albums together have not left cd player for the past 2 months. I was excited for Lady Gaga's release of \\"Born This Way\\" last month and I've only listened to it a couple times. Adele grabs you and doesn't let go. The songs never get old and you can't help but like them more and more upon each listen. 5 Stars, indefinitely!
B003BVK36Q|1.0|The book started off well, but quickly got lost in useless tangents and characters ranting on about things that didn't matter to the story.  I quickly started skimming the book to get to the good parts, but as other reviews have stated there is no enjoyment in forcing yourself to trudge through so I gave up.  This is probably the last Le Carre book I will ever read.  I don't get the admiration for him, he is no where near a Daniel Silva or other spy thriller authors.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|It is unfair to expect a return to the band's earlier, more progressive work, as it would be impossible for Symphony X to recreate the charm and magic of masterpieces like [[ASIN:B00012BD0S The Divine Wings of Tragedy]] or [[ASIN:B00004YR6K V: The New Mythology Suite]]. They explored all the parameters of that field to the max on those albums, and any attempt would fall short off the mark. It was time to move on.<br /><br />They are a different band now. After their transition into heavier territory with [[ASIN:B00006L83M The Odyssey]], the band released [[ASIN:B000I8ON6Q Paradise Lost]], replete with groove-inflected riffs, gritty vocals, subdued keyboards, onslaughts of metallic fury, and a more straightforward vibe. In many ways, Iconoclast expands on the aesthetics of the previous album. Having partly removed himself from neoclassic influences, Michael Romeo's playing has taken on tenacious, corrosive riffing. Most of the songs are imbued with rapid-fire riffs and his guitars besiege the mix in pretty much every track. His use of taking a main riff and then doing interesting permutations off of it has reached a new level, as he shifts from straightforward metallic riffery to Middle Eastern themes visiting neoclassical domains in between.<br /><br />Russell Allen still delivers gritty vocals, at times backed by dark choir-like chants in the background. His aggressive vocals have become the trademark for the new Symphony X sound, given these songs cannot be sung otherwise. That's not to say he does not make use of his clean vocals. Actually when listened carefully, the shift between vocal styles is done for a reason. Allen employs the grit for dynamic expression and in order to portray a wider range of emotions. That is the reason why tracks like \\"The End of Innocence\\" and \\"Children of a Faceless God\\" achieve their full potential, particularly when complemented by the dexterous guitar work.<br /><br />Also, the band hasn't abandoned their roots completely. \\"When All Is Lost\\" is rife with nuance, boasting majectic synth work, hook-laden melodic vocals, and wonderful harmonies. Michael Pinnella is present in the mix throughout, adding a rich sound to the piece. Mike LePond's bass is loud and central to the composition as well. Notice how he accentuates the piece beneath Romeo's restrained solo before everything cuts out for Pinella to lay down his signature keyboard line.<br /><br />The 2-disc version of the album is essential, as some of the songs are actually so good it would be a shame to miss them. Fans of older material may enjoy \\"Prometheus (I Am Alive)\\" for its layered guitar riffs, crystal clear vocals, and concise drumming.<br /><br />Overall, this album surpasses Paradise Lost for me, but I still gravitate towards The Odyssey for achieving a finer balance between their more prominent progressive leanings and heaviness. That said, judjed on its own, it doesn't get better than this. This album is staggering in scope and mindblowing in its delivery.<br /><br />On another note, the artwork, at first glance, reminded me of Evergrey's second album, [[ASIN:B0001I2C7K Solitude Dominance Tragedy]], which is a good thing, of course.th nuance, boasting majectic synth work, hook-laden melodic vocals, and wonderful harmonies.

B001GKJ2FM|5.0|My purchase of Mama Mia, in full screen format on DVD was the best purchase I have made all year. The picture quality is perfect, and the sound is amazing. I enjoyed it tremendously, right up until my 11 year old Granddaughter came to visit and watched it with me. When she left two days later it went with her. Her Mother has informed me she watches it every day and is driving her insane with it. Thanks to the feature showing the words to the songs, when my Granddaughter is not watching the DVD, she is singing the songs. All in all justifying it as the best purchase I have made all year. Thanks Amazon!!!!!

B000MV8ABS|4.0|\\"I am fascinated and frightened by the American way of death...how a corpse is spirited away by the mortician to some place we are not allowed to go, refabricated by the embalmer, and grandly interred. I knew the subject would make a great horror movie.\\" - Don Coscarelli<br /><br />Directed, written (in an isolated mountain cabin in an intense three weeks), photographed and edited on a modest $300,000 budget by Don Coscarelli, who was only 24 at the time, and starring Michael Baldwin, Bill Thornbury, Reggie Bannister, and Angus Scrimm, \\"Phantasm\\" ranks high on my list of camp classic horror films.<br /><br />Jody Pearson (Thornbury) is 24 and doing his best to raise his 13-year-old brother Mike (Baldwin) in their small hometown after the deaths of their parents. As a result, Mike exhibits separation anxiety issues, and follows his older brother practically everywhere he goes, including a funeral. After the funeral Mike sees the mortician, a creepy-looking old tall man (Scrimm) easily pick up the coffin under one arm and steal it, including its contents.<br /><br />This of course triggers his already active curiousity, and along with his brother and their ice-cream vendor and musician friend Reggie (Bannister) he becomes involved in trying to stop the Tall Man, who in addition to his superhuman strength shows a talent for flinging whizzing lethal silver spiked spheres at people's heads. The Tall Man ploddingly pursues Mike while darkly calling out to him, \\"BOYYYY!\\" (the most-quoted line in the film, and with good reason).<br /><br />The bodies pile up (and disappear) as the Tall Man reanimates them to be dwarf slaves in some alternate world...still with me? As ridiculous as this all sounds (and is), combined with the great soundtrack, sometimes unintentionally hilarious dialogue and visuals, and bizarre scenes that don't have any relevance whatsoever to the already convoluted storyline (such as Reggie suddenly whipping out his guitar for an impromptu jam with Jody), and some truly campy and gory special effects (the film was originally rated X for the sphere scenes), it somehow all works, because all this and more make \\"Phantasm\\" a prime example of the Camp Horror Classic genre.

B004GUSG4M|1.0|I read a very favorable early review and anticipated an engrossing read, but this novel was a dud.  The main character is simply boring, and the other characters are poorly drawn out and boring. It almost bordered on a parody of Ian McEwan's novel On Chesil Beach's doom-crossed couple mixed with Bill Murray's Groundhog Day, except this novel is far from amusing.  It's implausible from start to finish, and reads like a very lame Harlequin Romance/Agatha Christie mystery as if written by a hack version of Stieg Larsson. Silly and a waste of my time.

B003Y74AZ2|4.0|Right after I bought my Verizon-based iPhone I immediately started looking into buying a case.  I always carry my phone with me in my pocket so I wanted something that wrapped around the device but wasn't too bulky.  I don't like the hard cases as I worry they'll scratch the phone and most I've seen get completely covered in scratches themselves.  I also balked at the prices retail stores charged for cases (usually $30 to $50 and up!!).<br /><br />After doing some searching on Amazon I found this AmazonBasics case.  It's cheap, has a nice design, and was made specifically for the Verizon iPhone.  Once it arrived in the mail I quickly slipped it on and was pleased with my purchase.  It offers good protection, fits perfectly, and doesn't add very much bulk.  You'll have easy access to the buttons and the USB connector.  The camera, flash, speaker, and microphones are all completely unblocked and you'll even see your Apple logo.  It also helps with the signal attenuation (AKA the deathgrip) that was made famous with the AT&T-based iPhone.  If I'm not thinking about it when browsing on 3G I'll almost always hold the phone in a way that drops the signal strength down to 1 or 2 bars.  With the case on my signal never drops below 3 bars no matter how I'm holding the phone.<br /><br />Something this case does better than many slip-ons I've seen is keep the screen from touching whatever surface you set it on.  There isn't much gap, but it does raise it up enough to help prevent scratches to the glass.  The ribbed circular design on the back serves to help you grip the phone and will help keep it from sliding around tables surfaces and whatnot.  The phone can stand up on end or on its side to watch movies but it will still fall down easily.  If movie watching from your night stand or airplane tray is important you'll want to get a case with a kick stand.<br /><br />If you're really rough on your phone or have a habit of dropping it on the ground you'll want to look at a more heavy-duty case.  But if you're like me, and are very careful with your electronic devices, then this case should serve you well.  My only complaint and the reason for knocking off a star is that the fit of the case is kind of loose around the sides on top.  The area around the USB connector is particularly loose.  I don't worry the case will come off but hopefully the edges won't catch on anything either.<br /><br />So to summarize, this is a very good (and affordable) case that offers good protection against scratches while presenting a simple and attractive design.  Recommended!you're like me, and are very careful with your electronic devices, then this case should serve you well.

0307454541|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this book, but I thought I'd never finish.  I'm not in the habit of doing bad reviews, thinking that the ones I dislike are just not \\"my kind of read\\", but sometimes I just have to put my 2cents worth in.  I'm not even sure what the actual story line was, since there were so many things going on at once.  There's a mystery buried in all the \\"stuff\\", and I simply kept going, in the hopes of finding the answer to that.  It held my interest so badly, that I read 4 other books while I struggled through this one.  Sorry.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|The last Pearl Jam album I bought was Vitalogy, and although I loved several of the songs, I eventually chased the next fad band: this was a period where Everclear became my favorite band and forgot about Vedder and Pearl Jam as they moved from pop rock band to cult jam band status.  In my memory, Vedder IS what I call \\"Rockstar Voice\\".  It's hard to explain, but listen to \\"Daughter\\" once and you'll understand -- listen to anything by Creed and you'll hear a bad imitation.  This persists in many of the rock bands that still crack top 40 radio.  In short, I saw him not as an artist, but as a joke shorthand for what is bad with current \\"rock\\" music even if he isn't directly responsible.<br /><br />So, in this mindset, when my wife told me not only was there an Eddie Vedder album where he plays the Ukulele and sings original songs with little accompaniment, I thought it was a novel lark.  It wasn't too much money (I am old enough and dedicated to the arts enough I still buy and rip the CDs) to be prohibitive, so I thought \\"Why Not?\\".<br /><br />And here's the thing.  Its good.  I'm not really a fan of the singer or the instrument, but I still find myself singing along and bobbing my head.  Not in the Katy Perry \\"Why am I singing along to 'I Kissed a Girl'?\\" singalong, but one where I am enjoying well-crafted songs by a talented artist/musician.  It is not Rockstar Voice with a Uke, but something both simple and wonderfully complex at the same time.  It's not quite Pearl Jam backing Neil Young for \\"Mirrorball,\\" but it is an incredible artifact to hold onto.
B0052U59F4|1.0|I only bought this on Kindle because I was curious to see whether a professional edit made it any better than the original fanfic (which was mediocre at best, and which I abandoned once I realized the plot wasn't original enough for me to suffer through the author's cut-rate writing).  Paging through this \\"published\\" version makes me more embarrassed for the author than I was when it was in the fanfic domain, and it DEFINITELY made me lose respect for The Writer's Coffee Shop.      Most distracting is the schizophrenic voice of the main character, Ana.  In one paragraph, Ana's words are so juvenile as to sound like they're coming from a quasi-literate teenager; in the next paragraph she uses uber-literate words like \\"gamine\\".  Are we supposed to believe that she's naive or sophisticated?  Un-self-aware or articulate?      Add in culture confusion: Ana is supposed to be American, but the author (who is from the U.K.) keeps having Ana use Britishisms!  Her roommate isn't \\"sick\\" like American people are, she's \\"ill\\"; Ana doesn't \\"grab her bag\\" before going out the door, she \\"gathers her satchel\\".  Ana's voice simply doesn't ring true for an American girl.    Yet, the worst literary crime is the outright misuse of language.  Says Ana at one point: \\"The elevator whisks me with terminal velocity to the twentieth floor.\\"  Um...terminal velocity occurs when the downward force of gravity equals the upward force of drag, and it can't be reached by a controlled-speed mechanism that draws an object upward (such as an elevator).  Even if the author didn't know this, the editor should have caught it.    The problems don't end there.  From cliches (without a lick of irony or humor, Ana is described as putting the \\"pedal to the metal\\" as she drives), to awkward sentences, to nonsensical metaphors, this work is amateurish at best.  There's nothing wrong with being an amateur, but there IS something wrong with trying to take the fast track to the top in the absence of any real mastery.  If this author wants to be taken seriously, she should take the time to learn about writing craft and align herself with real editors.

0425241505|5.0|Being an avid reader and having become a bit disenchanted with the paranormal romance genre; I almost did not purchase this book. But, the reviews intrigued me and so I gave a new author (for me) a try. I was more than pleasantly surprised as I became quickly hooked into the book. The authors style is smooth, she weaves her storyline expertly; no annoying mishaps or errors in her development of events. The characters evolve into the readers conscience with the right impact; we know them and form the proper understanding of their roles within the story and to each other. I liked the heroine, Pia; gutsy and prepared to do whatever it takes to survive. The relationship between herself and others; mother, dragon, potential friends / enemies etc. was well explained and progressed in a reasonably rational manner. (Hard to \\"love\\" an old as the Earth itself Dragon.) I enjoyed the action scenes as well as the love scenes and didnt think either was simply gratuitously inserted for a formulaic PNR type book. All-in-all my only complaint is the sequels are not ready for me...have to wait a bit and I am not so good at waiting. So hurry up please!

If nothing else, you get to see about a 3 second snippet of footage with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins and Eric Clapton on their guitars!!!!!
0316056863|4.0|I read this book over the course of a day and found it to be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.   Tina Fey offers a few anecdotes about growing up in Philadelphia, the difficulties of being a woman in comedy, and other stories about her husband and daughter. She's reflective, insightful and self-deprecating, so as never to come off as self-indulgent. She includes a chart of jobs and their relative levels of difficulty, wherein she illustrates how significantly more stressful creating 30 Rock was compared to SNL, then compares that to active military duty and being a Chilean miner. You never get the feeling like you want to slap her spoiled face, which for me, means she's tremendously likeable.   I'm not sure this book contains a great deal of literary value. A good percentage of the book contains no essays, but her responses to internet critics and a catalog of her favorite lines from the first season of 30 Rock. It does seem a bit rushed, and like she's trying to fill up space and meet a deadline, but although it's not perfect writing, it's a fun, worthwhile read.

Perhaps I was just ready for another Mickey Haller novel, but this one grabbed me fairly early on and kept my interest throughout.

0439023513|4.0|Book 3 of the Hunger Games trilogy cranks up the grimness and leaves readers despairing. Still you just have to read it. You're compelled. You won't be sorry you did; but don't expect to be happy you did.    Plot Summary:  To protect her boyfriend Peeta, imprisoned at the Capitol, Katniss agrees to become a Mockingjay symbol in the District 13 rebels' plan to take over the Capitol.    My Opinion:  If you read book 1 \\"Hunger Games\\" and book 2 \\"Catching Fire\\" you feel the momentum and are compelled to see what happens to these fabulous characters from this complicated world. If you're like me, you can't not read book 3. You may also be disappointed at how different this book is from the previous two.     They're all grim, but this book is grimmer. The setting is post-bombing wasteland or underground dark worlds, the costumes are grey, the people are all broken and demoralized or going crazy. The humor is non-existent. To say it's depressing is an understatement.     It's also a powerful read. The message of the evils of war are illustrated--relentlessly. The personal exchanges are far and few between, but when they occur, particularly between Peeta and Katniss, they are moving and heart wrenching (e.g. their first conversation left me in tears).    This is one of those books I don't really \\"like\\" but it's still an excellent book. I was only disappointed with the poor payout of the love triangle. We spent two books reading the build up and the resolution was boiled down to a paragraph and short epilogue that left me very unsatisfied. Relationships, not war tactics, are what make books interesting. This focused on action more than people to get its message across, and suffered for it, imho.    Not the best in the series, but still a must read if you've read the first two.
3836503050|5.0|This book is great tribute to Gil Elvgren and his work. It is really precious, from interesting text part in three languages (en, de, fr), through the drawings themselves (with drawing year and name attached) to drawing index sorted alphabetically with reference to the book page.  If it is must to find something negative, let's say some drawings are really tiny (some 3x3 in or 7x7 cm) - see sample images. Every single one deserves full size and I believe it was painful deciding which drawings keep and which ones shrink....  It is impossible to name my favorite drawings, easier task is select those several which are 'not as favorite as other ones'.    This book simply exceeded my expectations and the price is really nice. If you are wondering about it, grab it!
B003V63VNI|4.0|While anxiously waiting for the Incubus release coming soon, I saw that Brandon Boyd released a solo album. I was so pleased to hear that his voice is as strong as ever and with the creative musical support behind him, I wouldn't be surprised if he decides to pursue a solo career someday. For anyone who loves Incubus and the talent this singer possesses, I highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give the CD 5 stars, is I was expecting perfection. There were a few questionable mixes and one of the songs is a bit over produced. Other than that, the CD is worth acquiring.
0061134007|3.0|All in all this is a really good book.  But saying he is the next Stieg Larsson raised my expectations so much that I was disappointed in Redbreast and Nemesis too.   Jo Nesbo writes a good, thoughful thriller but it is really more like a 3.5 than a 5.

0374531269|5.0|This is one of the few memoirs that has truly touched my heart. The account that Ishmael gave is both terrifying and eye-opening. I have read several reviews that criticize the accuracy of his accounts. To those thinking about buying this book, DO NOT let that sway you. Whether certain aspects relate directly to him or not, the events take place in the lives of so many other child soldiers every day. Do not let petty criticism distract you from the larger picture, that our children, our future, are being recruited to fight adult wars with little to no gain to themselves except to secure food and shelter, which are considered basic human needs.<br /><br />The book is well written and meticulously describes the hardships faced by members of the Sierra Leone community. I urge everyone to give this book a chance.

B004VFYOA2|5.0|When I knew that this DVD was going to be released, of course I was expecting to buy it, but after reading some reviews in here, I changed my mind a little bit. Finally I saw the product at a local store here in Mexico City and I didn't think it a lot and I bought it.  Yes, it's not the best quality video out there, but it's not the worst!! We're lucky enough to see this performance after 20 years!! It's better to have this that don't have it. Period.  GREAT PERFORMANCE, GREAT MUSICIANS, GREAT LINEUP AND PROBABLY THE BEST WHITESNAKE MOMENT OF ALL TIME!!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I've always wanted a rangefinder and did my research for several months before I decided on the V2.  A few of my friends own the Bushnell Medalist, but I like the V2 better because it's smaller, easier to focus, the pin-seeker feature is excellent and yardages are spot on.  I would recommend this to anyone!!
B004O86JZ4|5.0|I didn't realize this record was recorded at Dave's house and mastered on 24 track tape until I watched the Back and Forth DVD (5 stars). It was a nice touch to include a little piece of mastering tape in the CD case. Analog rules! How many huge bands let you see them at home with their families? Not many. They just frickin' RIP every single track on this CD! The smoothness of the master tapes come through on the CD. If you are a new or old FF fan then you need this set. Definitely buy the LP version if you have a phono stage at home.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I had to see this movie to answer the obvious question: If you put Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in a movie together, do you get a really good movie or a really bad one? Evidently, you get a really bad one.<br /><br />The whole thing is about A.J.'s thickly-lacquered face with its over-inflated lips gliding along - either when she's ambulating down the street or floating by in a motorboat. Let's just say she doesn't show a lot of range. She never - not once - changes her expression. The entire part could have been portrayed by a life mask made of epoxy, and fitted with slowly batting eye-shadowed lids.<br /><br />If the woman were in some sense beautiful, this might all have worked, but she isn't beautiful in this movie. If the camera is framing her face, she looks artificial to other-worldly. If it zooms back a little, she looks skinny. If the camera zooms back a little more, she looks ridiculous, because she is so thin, her shoes look way too big. It's worth mentioning that A.J. shows no skin in this movie, probably because she is so emaciated that if she did, the only thing she would arouse would be concern.<br /><br />Once again, it IS very important to analyze how A.J. looks in this thing, because that's the only thing this movie is about. (Some actresses come out with lines of cosmetics. A.J. should come out with a line of Alkyd enamel.)<br /><br />No matter how good the actor, each has a default role he can do in his sleep and usually does. Johnny Depp has one - the one in this movie. That's all that need be said about him.<br /><br />The villains are all Russian - except for the lead villain. He is actually British but LOOKS Russian, and (so it is explained) hangs out with Russians. So why isn't he Russian? Dunno. Have to guess the actor couldn't do the accent. Why are the others Russian? Don't know that one either. Russian villains are clich&eacute; and so is the movie, so maybe they're just being decorous.<br /><br />All the Russians are ugly; the American is hapless; all the male Brits but the villain who couldn't do the accent are dashing; Jolie, who was raised in Britain, is supposed to be beautiful, but misses the mark.<br /><br />There have been some references to the predictable plot twist. I suppose you can call it a twist - albeit one that requires torque wrench. It was still predictable, but only because the movie was so bad that one could not possibly rule it out.<br /><br />As others have noted, _The Tourist_ could have been done differently in the forties or fifties, with a script built around leads that had personality and chemistry. It would still have been a trifling affair, and a clich&eacute;, but it would have been entertaining. This movie comes off like _Xanadu_'s attempt at a musical. The idea was there, the concept was straightforward, but the producing, directing, and acting skills to pull it off were lost in the intervening decades.<br /><br />This attempt is simply incompetent.ho couldn't do the accent are dashing; Jolie, who was raised in Britain, is supposed to be beautiful, but misses the mark.

B004W48QFG|5.0|This is the BEST Rdp app on the market. I have had it for well over a year and it always works flawlessly, well worth the price. Connects great to both x64 and x86
B000002V07|5.0|As a product of the 60s, born in the early 50s, when I first heard this CD of what seems a decade ago, I found it to be utterly addictive. The melancholy narcotic droning of Hope Sandoval's voice, is a hook that's impossible to quit. I'm not quite sure how to describe its lyrical qualities. Some of it reminds me of early Dylan in his wide belt and work shirt folk days of the early 60s, combined with a strong dose of Janis Ian and Lenord Cohen, and a dash of Janis Joplin. This, however, would be an incomplete comparison of the bands unique lyrics, sound, and tone. Mazzy Stars \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\", will continue to be listened to well into the future.
0439023491|3.0|I read it but found it very repetitive.  I felt like the entire book was written just so there could be a trilogy.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, was introduced to me by my daughter.  His artworks are being displayed at the Dixon Gallery and Gardens in Memphis Tennessee. True, it is a story about a young boy, Hugo and his hard life.  He is intrigued by automation, which his father found in an attic of the museum he worked at. The mystery begins to unfold after Hugo finds the automation after a museum fire. The novel is rich in both fact and fiction, along with the artworks of Brian Selznick.  I reread the novel several times and still enjoy its content. I dare the young and old to dip into this book. You wont be disappointed! Brian Selznick truly deserves the Caldecott Medal!
B004NSULHM|3.0|Despite the polarizing reviews here, let's be honest, this isn't the best album Radiohead has ever made, but it's not awful. It's still got some great music on it, if you are a Radiohead fan. And if you are a Radiohead fan, you should have gotten used to them being uncompromising and pushing boundaries by now. Anyone waiting for them to make another Ok Computer, has hopefully given up on that by now. It's important to look at their body of work as a whole, and this album just another piece of  a larger body of work. And if you don't like it, that's fine. But is this album some horrible, pretentious piece of modern art rock garbage? no. I'm not expecting them to keep making albums that are going to forever grace lists of the best albums of our generation which at the very least OK Computer and Kid A, should make with no problem. I've listened to this album now several times, and am ready to settle for what it is, another Radiohead album which is better than a lot of music out there, even if this isn't their best album. It's still a good record, nonetheless.
B0033TJATW|5.0|Wonderful copy!!  Had no problem playing it on my dvd - very clear.  As far as the movie itself goes, I love it!  Seen it as a child and watching it now brings back memories and make the movie more enjoyable - especially now that my son has seen it a million times and absolutely loves it as well!  I think for someone to actually enjoy this movie as an adult, you had to have watched it as a kid.    Glad I found it on dvd.  :)
0439023521|4.0|Given some of the reviews I was surprised to find myself liking the book.  I'm not a teenager either.  The subject matter was terrifying but not explicitly descriptive enough to put me off.  I hate violence for the sake of violence but this seems to have a purpose.  It is the kind of book that haunts the reader.  There are so many reviews I won't say more.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely adored this book.  It was chock full of bad-boy-turned-love-sick romance that is right up my alley!  It is slightly unbelieveable in that the Lucky Thirteeen aspect isn't the normal girl, but it was completely relateable.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|Awesome as F*** was great. I wished it would have had more concert clips from other venues but great just the same.
0743496736|4.0|I really liked this book. This is my first Jodi Picoult book and I wasn't sure what to expect. I was familiar with the ending to \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and wasn't too thrilled with it, but decided to give this book a chance without even knowing what it was about.    Even though Picoult chose to tell the story mainly from the points of view of Alex, Lacy and Josie (and sometimes Peter, but not enough Peter, I felt). I would have liked to see it from Matt's perspective too. The book focused a lot on Josie's back story and reaction, so you KNEW something was going to happen with her at the end, since Picoult is known for her patented twists at the end of the story.    Anyone who went to high school could picture kids from their time as characters from the book -- the homecoming queen, the popular jock, the in-between kids, the one that gets bullied. The dynamics of growing up will always stay the same; how far will kids go to fit in, not be bullied, or feel good about themselves?    Is it bad to say Josie was an annoying character? That I could sympathize with Peter and how is parents favored Joey over him? That I felt for Alex - the woman who could rule the professional world but not her home? That there are a thousand Matt's and Drew's in the world --- and nothing ever happens to shake their belief that they should be popular, that there should be an \\"us\\" and a \\"them\\"?
B003J27WFW|5.0|For me this one is a no-brainer, as obvious a 5-star rating as I'm ever going to give.  A solid, fun and warmly personal documentary about my long-time favorite band is about the greatest thing I can experience on a screen.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this film takes you from the band's humble beginnings in the early 1970s through their years of heavy prog-rock, to the peak of pop success in the early 1980s, finally leaving off with the band members as the elder statesman of rock n roll that they are now.  The story is engaging, sometimes very funny and always very revealing, making this band even more likeable than they already were (if that's possible).  It's a fan's dream.  I saw it in the theater with my best friend, who is the biggest Rush fan I have ever met, and the audience consisted of a bunch of guys (very few women in attendance) aged 30 and up.  The members of San Diego band Pinback were in attendance as well, and I got a chance to chat with them briefly at the end of the show as well (they were a local favorite of mine when I lived in San Diego).<br /><br />All that said, just because I am a huge Rush fan and had this sort of man-cave-ish experience with the film doesn't mean that you necessarily won't like it if you aren't: a) a huge Rush fan; or b) male and middle-aged.  The fact is, this is at its core just a great story about 3 good friends who managed to somehow defy all odds and their own expectations to become one of the world's biggest and most artistically honest rock n roll acts.  The events that took place follow them through decades of cultural change, from the 1960s to the present.  I can honestly say that even if I had not much in the way of prior knowledge about Rush there would still be enough here to hold my attention.  That is the mark of great documentary filmmaking.<br /><br />So whether or not you are a Rush fan, this might just be worth your time.  If you are even mildly interested in this band, the film is something you NEED to see.
B003TVMIDO|4.0|I love the Lennon Signature box and I appreciate the seller's prompt handling of my order. I received it within 3 days of the original order. So, my buying experience was great. I'll give the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the individual albums were packaged in a way that almost damaged the CDs. This was probably a manufacturing defect. There was glue on the CDs due to some problem with the packaging. The CDs were stuck at the bottom of the album sleeves. I had to clean up the glue on each CD. Thankfully, none of them were damaged.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am an avid fantasy and history reader, this book combined and melded the two. I literally couldn't put my Kindle down. I kept picking it up at red lights, in meetings, and while I was walking home from work. I just couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next! Well rounded characters, well thought out plot, lots of twists and turns. A must read for anyone who is watching the series on HBO! While the series is absolutely fabulous, the book has so much detail the series couldn't fit in. Read it today!
B001POX73C|3.0|** spoiler alert ** I did not like this book as much as I liked Heyer's other book, The Grand Sophy. I felt this book's plot was too contrived, and it was a lot more confusing. Also, the action didn't pick up until midway through, and by that time, I just wanted to know how the book ended. The ending was enjoyable, if predictable, I think it's Heyer's style to wrap up a bunch of storylines in 20 pages.    Uncle Matthew decides to name orphaned Kitty his heiress if she marries one of his great-nephews (whose mothers -- his sisters -- he doesn't like). Everyone expects Kitty will marry Jack Westruther, his favorite, as she's crushed on Jack since she was young. But Jack doesn't like to be forced into a decision, and wants to lead the bachelor life for a long as possible. So he doesn't propose to Kitty right away, and as a result, this story happens.    Instead, Kitty gets 2 awful proposals. One from Dolph, who is only proposing because his mother made him, and Reverend Hugh, who proposes because he feels sorry for her.    Kitty manages to convince another nephew, Freddy Standen to pretend to be engaged to her (since he doesn't want to marry anyway). Her stated plan is to go to London with Freddy to visit his family and then remain there, break their engagement and live a quiet life. Her secret plan is to make Jack jealous.    Uncle Matthew allows Kitty to go to London since he can see through the fake engagement to her real purpose (which he wants to happen anyway).    During the 1 month in London, a type of cotillion occurs (a dance for four couples), with Kitty playing matchmaker or becoming involved in several couples' love-lives.    The ending isn't a surprise, but it was still cute.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Worst product I have ever exprienced. It's too sticky, bubbles you will never get rid of. Do your self a favor guys. Get a $1.60 screen protector instead of paying $16 for this crap!
B004WPYNY8|5.0|ill start off by saying that i think this album is amazing and nothing short of what i expected from symphony x. its filled with great solos and hooks and not to mention some great drumming from Rullo. Allen sounds at the top of his game and all around  this album kicks the crap out of you from start to finish. theres not a weak part on the album and thats what i dont understand about some of the reviews ive read. on one end you have some of these so called fans of the band...but unless they write abums that sound like \\"V\\" over and over again their not happy. so what...they got heavier and polished their sound, its still great music and if you cant respect a band for changing then youre not really a fan of music or the band. and we have again \\"fans\\" that put the album on the side burner because its sounds too much like paradise lost. well what does symphony x have to do then? if it doesnt sound like the old it gets bashed, if it sounds too much like the new it gets bashed. this is a new album so its going to sound like new S-X. i know people are entitled to their opinion just like me so people will say what they want. now with all that being said i think the album is great and i hope they continue to make killer music. anyone who likes old and new S-X should find this album enjoyable, i sure did.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Many times you read a book and it's so well written you are on pins and needles waiting to read the sequel... only to be let down. Not so with this sequel! The saga continues, the plot thickens and if anything the characters personalities only grow and develop in this second installment! I again could not put the book down. I was losing sleep trying to finish it. I read it walking home from work and nearly got lost in traffic. Can't wait to start the third book, although I'm pacing myself, so I can finish the fourth book just as the fifth is released so I won't be left hanging too long! This is a must read series for ANY fantasy fan!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|wish would let u save page I'm on everytime open app starts me back at beginning don't like trying to remember exactly where I ended
0525423273|4.0|This is a hard book review to write because there were some things I just loved about this story and other things that drove me crazy!! To sum up what goes on in this story; Anna is forced to spend her senior year at a school in Paris for Americans.  She is not thrilled to leave behind her best friend or her possible boyfriend. She soon begins to love Paris though when she meets a couple of new friends and a hunky English American St.Clair.  Unfortunately he has a girlfriend though so she only idolizes him from a far!<br /><br />What I liked about Anna and the French Kiss; I liked the characters and the plot a lot!! Anna was a lovable character and so were all her friend she made in Paris. They reminded me of the group of friends I always hung out with in high school and we did everything together!  Very genuine and believable.<br /><br />The plot was pretty unique and I although I could guess the ending pretty much from the beginning I never knew what was going to happen next. It had a very satisfying ending which is always a make-or-break for me and this ending sold the book!<br /><br />What I didn't like about it; I did not like the annoying romantic tension. Usually that doesn't bother me but in this book it did.  I was getting a bit frustrated with the way things were progressing SO SLOWLY!!<br /><br />CONTENT ALERT: This is more of a PG-13 book for me!! There was no sex scenes but sometimes the language was pure filthy, for example there was a few cuss words and the word slut was used repeatedly! It didn't really bother me a whole lot but I definitely wouldn't want my young teenager reading it.<br /><br />I will be looking to see what else Stephanie Perkins wrote because even though I was annoyed at times, this really was one of a few contemporary books I actually enjoyed!
B003LL3LHO|4.0|A well written piece of fantasy, Ghosts of Ascalon left me impressed -- and wanting Guild Wars 2 even more. It serves at once as both a heroic tale of a motley \\"krewe\\" and as a bridge between the first and second Guild Wars. In all honesty, I could see the book being a hard read for someone who knows nothing of the Guild Wars universe (one of the most immersive story arcs I've come across in a video game). At times, the story may seem slow paced, and the conversations between characters in which most of the history is given seem heavily scripted and rigid, as if the author wasn't allowed to take too much liberty. The disdain with which the authors (possible spoilers ahead)readily kill off characters(/spoilers) left me feeling a little upset. While I understand that the play style of GW is typically to not worry about your party members a great amount (usually revive-able NPC's or guild mates), it would have been nice to venture into a little more emotion when dealing with the loss of team mates. Or perhaps just the use of a single \\"Resurrection Signet\\".     The book could have a used another day in editing; missing punctuation, minor grammatical errors, and weird spacing pepper the pages -- then again, nobody is perfect. Don't expect an ultra-deep fantasy novel -- at times, it seems a little young-adult-ish in writing style, and is never a hard read (I think the biggest word in the novel is Kralkatorrik). But it's a highly enjoyable casual book, a must for any GW enthusiast.
B004XE0P5E|3.0|How do you follow up one of the best albums ever made? You don't. You can't- just ask Bon Iver (aka Justin Vernon), creator of the 2008 masterpiece \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" and now his self-titled sophomore album, \\"Bon Iver.\\"<br /><br />The most important thing to remember when crafting an album (said the man who has never made an album before) is to start and finish with brilliance. What happens in between is forgivable should the listener feel betrayed by the promises made by the artist. The first track, if it's a good one, will get the listener through the rest of the album. If it sucks, the rest of the album will be fast forwarded through until all can be redeemed by the all important final track. If the last track sucks, the first impression of the entire album is jeopardized.<br /><br />\\"Bon Iver\\" starts off strong with \\"Perth,\\" very reminiscent of the first album, and is driven by a haunting guitar riff combined with this epic, Civil War-declaring drum rap. As is the case with the greatest Bon Iver tracks, \\"Perth\\" would do well to add emotional resonance to a funeral scene of any television drama. One of the best tracks on the record.<br /><br />The second track, \\"Minnesota, WI\\" is dismissible, but quickly redeemed by \\"Holocene,\\" another acoustic number recalling \\"Emma.\\" Highlights follow with \\"Wash\\" and \\"Calgary,\\" which co-exist with \\"B-\\" tracks at best.<br /><br />The album ends, unfortunately, on a sour note with \\"Beth/Rest,\\" a track that sounds as if it back dropped a lost scene in \\"Top Gun\\" where Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer made out. With all the synths, electric piano, and sax \\"Beth/Rest\\" brings the worst part of the 80's back to the 2000's.<br /><br />All in all, what we have here is the descendant of a successful predecessor. The budget was bigger, more instruments were infused, but in the orchestration of it all, a sound was lost that is very much missed this time around.<br /><br />GRADE: B-
B00003CXB4|2.0|most of the dvd plays well..but once u get about half way thru it doesnt play at all it skips a lot and is unreadable..i wont buy from this person again
B0000027RL|5.0|Someone said it in another review- I dont how they did it but they managed to create a masterpiece which has something special which I can't really put my finger on. All i can say is that this album hits me deep and sucks me in and does something to me that I cant explain.   I can still remember the very first time I heard Once. I was about 15/16 years old and was at a party. My one friend put in a cassette and this strange music played. My reaction was \\" was is this crap ! \\" . I subsequently heard from him that this band , Pearl Jam , were the latest craze in America. Coming from South Africa things used to take awhile longer to hit our shores, but a frined had been to the states and brought him with the treasure of all treasures - a Pearl Jam cassette. I hated it at first but for some reason my friend managed to play Once a few times that evening and by the end of listening to it a few times a was not only intruged but was longing for more. Vedder had bitten me. The rest is history......this is my no.1 album of all time not only because it is a masterpiece but also because it defined my musical tastes growing up as a teenager.  Ten displays Vedder at his absolute best. He has never quite managed to maintain the sound on Ten. The music blends amazingly with bluezzzy type riffs accompanied by gritty melodies. I would actually say that Nirvana exemplify grunge more than Pearl Jam due to the musical sounds. I love Eddie's passion and emotional honesty on this album. He is who he is and that honesty shines through. Black is one of the most moving songs in history ! It is now 2011 and I still love this album.....now thats saying something.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son. The blu ray quality makes it look fantastic on my tv. I would recommend you purchase the blu ray since it is cheaper than buying the dvd.

B0055OK2T0|2.0|This movie turned out to be nothing like I thought it was going to be.  I will not spoil anything but don't expect to get excited or in suspense during this movie.  Not worth money wait for it on cable.
1416511946|5.0|I would not consider myself a reader by any stretch of the imagination, but after reading Motley Crue: The Dirt (which I finished in just 4 days...loved it!), I found myself wanting more.  This is a GREAT follow-up to The Dirt.  Or even on its own, it's a GREAT book.    While I am not, nor have I ever had to battle a real addiction, I found this book truly amazing and eye-opening.  The way it's written makes it such an easy read and although graphic at times, I could not put it down (only to sleep - I picked it right back up the next morning and finished it).  You truly get the sense of his struggle and the impact on others around him during that time.  The commentary was great, not only from Nikki, but from dozens of others who contributed to his story, which helps to paint a very clear picture throughout the book.    Loved it!  Would highly recommend - great rainy day read!

B004YKB52O|5.0|I first became a fan of Simple Plan back in 2008 with the release of their self-titled album, which quickly became number one on my list of most-played CDs that year.  From there, I went back and picked up the two previous CDs I had missed; I was somewhat disappointed.  Rumors of this new album hinted that it would be a return to their previous style.  This left me a little disheartened.  (Don't get me wrong; I love the high-energy, pop-punk style of all of their music, but I didn't want another set of songs with lyrics sounding like a 12-year-old, whining about topics such as: My life sucks; My dad hates me; God hates me, Life's not fair -- because someone else is having more fun than me.  Boo-hoo!  Get over it.)  It turns out, my skepticism was completely unfounded.  \\"Get Your Heart On!\\" is not a step backward; it's a firm step forward.    The variety of songs deals with more universal topics including: infatuation, loss, longing, loneliness and love (\\"Can't Keep My Hands Off You\\", \\"Gone Too Soon\\", \\"Jet Lag\\", \\"Astronaut\\", \\"You Suck at Love\\").  The music style has continued to mature as well, incorporating guest artists, a wider variety of instrumentation and a proper amount of post-production work.  Even with the additional depth, Simple Plan has held to their roots: high-energy punk style with strong lead vocals blended with well-balanced harmonies.    If you like \\"Save Me\\" (from their previous album), you'll love \\"Gone Too Soon\\", \\"Astronaut\\" and \\"This Song Saved My Life\\".  If you are a fan of \\"Holding On\\" (my personal favorite SP song ever), you'll have a great time with \\"You Suck at Love\\" and \\"Freaking Me Out\\".  Other songs, such as \\"Summer Paradise\\" introduce new style elements that bring variety and add to the whole albums' appeal.    I am thoroughly pleased with this new addition from Simple Plan.  It continues to build along their long-running trajectory of greatness.  It's been three years since their last CD, but \\"Get Your Heart On!\\" was worth the wait.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Ridley Scott's Gladiator is by far one of my favorite movies. It is an absolute Classic. You couldnt ask for a better movie. Russell Crowe's performance is a masterpiece. The hero is easy to relate to and the villain you will love to hate. The picture and sounds make you feel right in the action and back in time. Hats off to the amazing work that the crew and visual effects people have done for this film.<br />Winner of Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costumes, Best Visual Effects, and Best Picture. You cant go wrong with this picture. And who could argue with the themes of the work. Fighting for family, love, honor. Trust in your friends, duty, and to top it all off with courage and the will to never give up. I rate this 5/5 stars and recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
0756655307|5.0|I would love to be able to afford the A-Z series by MARVEL, but it's just waaaay too many volumes and waaaay too expensive.  I've got my kids hooked on MARVEL and superheros in general.  This book gives them just enough info about each character in the MARVEL universe to answer questions and gives a visual rendering of each so they can identify them...  great purchase!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister tossed this book at me after she read it in one night...and wow did I find out why! What an engaging \\"1984\\" style futuristic story. Definitely recommend reading it. Just started #2! Can't wait to see how the story continues

B00138EVNA|4.0|To tell you the truth, there wasn't that much artistic growth or maturity. Just the same juvenile, fluffy, bubblegum pop like her previous releases. The only maturity I saw was her songs I'm A Slave 4 U and Boys. The songs on here are kinda off-based and inconsistent. One minute she's singing songs like she's an adult and the next she's singing songs that make her sound like a little girl trying to fill in a grown woman's shoes. There weren't that many amazing songs on here aside a few songs. In The Zone was really the one where we saw the complete change and maturity. 'Britney' was good, but In The Zone and the ones she released after sounded ALOT better than this one. If you're still a kid in high school, then maybe you will like this album. If you're 21 and up, then you will find her recent albums more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />1-I'm A Slave 4 U (4.5/5)- Sometimes I feel like i don't really get the appeal over this song, it's nothing to write home about. it's hot and a real tease but it is not all that stellar either in terms with the arrangement. It kinda grows on you.<br /><br />2-Overprotected (4/5)-it's ironic how she's singing about how she feels sheltered and is tired of people of controlling her life, yet she still has people controlling her life and her career. She sounds so confident, assured, and aggressive in this song.<br /><br />3-Lonely (4/5)-sounds like a rehash version of stronger but with an edge.<br /><br />4-I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (4/5)-definitely not a favorite. in terms of the lyrics, it sounds very weak and cheesy, but it's a very decent ballad with a nice melody. her other ballads from the bottom of my broken heart and don't let me be the last to know are FAR superior than<br />this.<br /><br />5-Boys (3/5)-the remix sounded way better than the original. It should have been replaced and reissued with the remix version. Back then, it was new to hear britney sing these type of songs...now it's just typical britney.<br /><br />6-Anticipating(5/5)-i actually like this song alot more than the rest..she sounds alot like kylie minogue. i was really amazed. i enoy the lyrics as well. my favorite would have to be \\"you got to make me feel sexy\\"<br /><br />7-I Love Rock 'n' Roll (1/5)-not nearly as good as the original...but it was ok. it sounded too karoake-ish<br /><br />8-Cinderella (5/5)-very cute song.<br /><br />9-Let Me Be (3/5)-has a nice attitude and theme like overprotected.<br /><br />10-Bombastic Love (4/5)-actually, she sounds really cute in this song..in a girly kinda way.<br /><br />11-That's Where You Take Me (2/5)-boring beat...boring lyrics.<br /><br />12-What It's Like To Be Me (4/5)-sounds similar to Lonely. it's a nice duet with her and justin.<br /><br />average rating: 3.625/5-Anticipating(5/5)-i actually like this song alot more than the rest..she sounds alot like kylie minogue. i was really amazed. i enoy the lyrics as well. my favorite would have to be \\"you got to make me feel sexy\\"<br /><br />7-I Love Rock 'n' Roll (1/5)-not nearly as good as the original...but it was ok. it sounded too karoake-ish<br /><br />8-Cinderella (5/5)-very cute song.<br /><br />9-Let Me Be (3/5)-has a nice attitude and theme like overprotected.<br /><br />10-Bombastic Love (4/5)-actually, she sounds really cute in this song..in a girly kinda way.<br /><br />11-That's Where You Take Me (2/5)-boring beat...boring lyrics.<br /><br />12-What It's Like To Be Me (4/5)-sounds similar to Lonely. it's a nice duet with her and justin.<br /><br />average rating: 3.625/5
0316019984|3.0|WOW!  I had no idea this pop-up was going to be twice as thick as 'Atlas Shrugged!'<br />It's thick...  i mean really THICK!!!  The pop-ups are AMAZING!  But they're also very fragile.<br />I don't recommend this for kids under the age of 10-12 years old.  There needs to be an appreciation for the art work and the art of pop-up.  The pages need to be turned VERY slowly and sometimes the pop-ups (very complex) get snagged and you can't turn the page.<br />The book is pretty amazing.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I'm 56 and retired military. Had no intention of seeing movie since I'm an old fuddy-duddy who thinks 95% of what Hollywood churns out is crap, but my 17 year-old said it was excellent. Based on his review, I watched it, and I totally agree that Battle Los Angeles is an extremely well made war movie (despite the sci-fi angle - bad guys are bad guys, shoot 'em before they shoot you). Yes, it is a great non-stop action firefight, but so much more. It has heart, wit and wisdom. Hey, it even mentions World War II and John Wayne, so it has a little educational history for today's youth who attend public school and/or don't read books (or who don't watch old classic Hollywood movies). RENT IT!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|UNKNOWN is. Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending.  Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a  seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet.<br /><br />American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada).  But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life.  Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva L&ouml;bau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be  Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband.  Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst J&uuml;rgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity.  But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger.  Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight.<br /><br />The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance.  The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence.  Yes, there are some fine car chases and pyrotechnics, all well captured by Flavio Labiano's cinematography.  The driving musical score is the work of John Ottman and Alexander Rudd.  Though is a bit over long at 2 hours, it does deliver some fine entertainment. Just leave the sense of logic on the shelf for this one.

B004Q7DQLS|4.0|I absolutely loved Dragon Bound (May 2011), the new novel by Thea Harrison.  Catching the Kindle edition, I enjoyed the layers of magic and realism.  New York, easily recognizable, played the riveting backdrop of chase, escape, and turmoil.  Unexpected enemies made for a fascinating plot.  Harrison's gift of character, however, are what will make her books shine.  Pia, half-wyr/half-human, has hidden her entire life and in fact, has chaches of money across the city to assist in fast get-aways.  Dragos, a true `alpha' male, is the dragon-wyr and leader of his demesne centered in New York City.  Through a series of bad choices and blackmail, Pia steals from Dragos' hoard.  This `world' is peopled by humans, witches, fairies, thunderbirds, gryphons, goblins, and of course, a very angry dragon.   There are endless future permutations possible here.      I do have a couple of criticisms--Harrison is great with names throughout the novel, creative without being unintelligible.  So I found Dragos' moniker annoying; I had a moment where I flashed to Harry Potter and Ron Weasley snickering over Draco's name.  My second criticism is related to plot, so the following is a plot spoiler: BEWARE *stop reading if you don't want to know* Pia learns she's pregnant and is nauseated within 5 days.  I am sure there is some magical explanation that would account for 6-8 week symptoms, but there's no explanation, other than Drago must have \\"power\\" sperm to have overcome her birth control methods.      Frankly, these criticisms were minor, barely felt irritants in my overall pleasure.  I look forward to the next installment available in August.    Read other reviews at:  [...]

0071762345|4.0|I just finished reading Likeable Social Media - How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (and other social networks), by Dave Kerpen, his first book on a topic that he lives and breathes.  And, yes, I am a little biased, as I credit Dave with getting me hooked on this thing called \\"social media\\" (and thank him for providing an advanced review copy).  But does that mean I loved the book?  Actually, no.  While I like it, I found that it was a restatement of a lot of information I had already heard countless times before:  Engage, Be Authentic, Be Transparent and Honest, Learn to say \\"I'm Sorry\\" when necessary, and give your followers great content.      The greatest strength of this book was the numerous anecdotes that were used to illustrate each point.  Dell's use of social media to increase sales.  Ann Taylor's Loft pants issues.  The Gap Logo fiasco.  Each story helped explain what Kerpen believed was the correct (or incorrect) way to be \\"likeable\\".      Would I recommend this book for everyone?  While I believe everyone can get something out of it, I believe this book is best suited for a social media beginner, as it will help them envision what can be accomplished through a purposeful social media strategy.

B001E75QGG|5.0|Oh boy, oh boy. It's finally time to put into words anything regarding the fourth Indiana Jones film!  Whoa, what a low rating!  Let me read on and find out why this could be.....hmmmmmm......Okay, I'm back and boned up on what everyone's beef with this film is, and.....and....well, I still don't get why everyone hates on this film so much.  Here's what I'll do folks, I'll state all the most comman complaints regarding this film, and then when I'm done proving why they're all wrong, shortsighted, nit-picky, and stupid, I'll list the ACTUAL problems with this movie and how the ACTUAL flaws don't make it a bad movie.  Okay?<br /><br />Number one, and oh boy is it a big one, WHY ARE ALIENS IN INDIANA JONES?  ALIENS CANT BE/DON'T BELONG IN AN INDY MOVIE!  This baffles my mind to no end.  Why the hell not?  I've heard because Indy movies are about religeous artifacts.  Well, the crystal skulls and some wild theories now and then about where they're from are religeous.  Sure, they're no Judeo-Christian myths, but neither were the stones in the second Indy film.  In the words of the much wiser than you, apparently, Indiana Jones, \\"It depends on who your God is\\", as he is referring to his son's disbelief in a mishapen skull.  On top of that there are crystal skulls in real life, they are mentioned in this film, and they are linked to the specific skull that plays the maguffin in this film.  Plus, Myans had God myths about them as well.  Now I went to a basic public school and a more basic college, but I knew the implications of the extra terrestrial and the crystal skulls from my studies.  Did no one else honestly know anything about that connection?  Also, the film is set in the 50's!  HELLO!  All the Indy films are modern retellings of old pulpy serials from the 20's, 30's and 40's.  They all reflect that, and what was the biggest genre of films in the 50's?  Alien invasion stories and sci-fi in general.  It's all in the title and in the synopsis.  Why someone can buy the power of god melting Nazi's, magical stones that grow crops and help cult leaders enslave people, and cups of Christ that grant everlasting life---and are guarded by an ancient and very much alive Knight of King Arthur's court, but not aliens blows my friggin' mind.  Really does.<br /><br />Secondly, the oft-quoted by those without a clever bone in their body, \\"Nuke the Fridge\\" scene.  True, it's silly, impossible and totally rediculous.  You know what else is silly, impossible, and totally rediculous?  Out-running a giant boulder(how'd they get it up there) on foot through a cave, hiding on the outside of a submarine while at sea, fall off of, being dragged under, and climbing under a moving vehicle while being chased and shot at.  Oh, Also, it's very silly to jump out of a plane on a rubber boat and simply land on a slope, survive, and continue down into a river.  It's also unlike to out run, on foot, a massive body of water tumbling towards you.  And I'm pretty sure you can't jump a mine cart 30 feet from one track to another without derailing or dying.  Oh, and lets not forget that Venice doesn't have sewers.  FIRE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  You can't outrun a plane, that's on fire, that is crashing and burning next to you while you're driving in a tunnel.  Oh, and you can't take out a tank by yourself on horseback.  Phew.....where did all those sill examples come from?  OH YEA, they came from the previous three Indy films!!!!  Spielberg and Lucas wanted these films to be outrageous, so they could reflect the adventures they grew up watching.  Yes, you can't survive a nuclear blast hiding in a fridge, BUT SO WHAT?!?!?!?!  It's Indiana Jones for cryng out loud.  That's the point.  It's fun.  The filmmakers were obviously having fun and up until the fourth movie most nit-pickers,apparently, were having fun too.  Apply this paragraph to the also oft-bitched about three waterfall sequence.<br /><br />Shia Lebeouf.  I don't get it.  He's not horrible.  He's got a natural screen presence and apparently Spielberg really likes him.  Does his looks resemble Harrison Ford or Karen Allen?  Hell to the no!  He looked like a sufficient enough greaser punk with smarts hidden under his visage.  I got it.  It played.  It was okay.  I don't know if some other young actor would've done better.  I do know what we got played well enough.<br /><br />Fourth, the vine swinging with the monkeys.  Yup, pretty silly and convenient for a plot point, but I saw it coming.  I mean, this whole sereis is a love letter to Matinee serials, and Tarzan was a BIG part of that, and they mention that they are going to an Amazon Jungle....nobody really saw this type of thing coming?  I know the average veg viewer doesn't know or really care much about film history, but this was a common thing to happen in jungle serials.  It looks silly,and it is, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a huge smile on my face when the scene appeared.  I'd be more concerned with how Shia managed to reach a moving vehicle while only swinging on vines.  That's impressive.<br /><br />THE GOPHER!!!!! The damn gopher!!!!!!  Really?  There's more than a small minority of people who actually care about this?  Do you guys get out much, I mean, when you're not constantly talking about something that you supposedly hate?  At the opening of every Indy film the Paramount log fades into something live on screen(a mountain Raiders, a gong in Temple of Doom, a cliff in Last Crusade).  This was a funny way to do this and make a self reference.  I thought it was clever and set up the scene for where the first bits of action take place.  It was fine.  Who cares?  You really do?  Oh well......<br /><br />TOO MUCH CGI!!!!  Here's what I think message boards would've looked like back in 1981, if the internet existed, after Raiders of the Lost Ark came out; TOO MUCH MATTE PAINTINGS!  WAY TOO MUCH SPLIT SCREEN BLENDING OF MODELS AND LIVE ACTION.  OH GOD, WAY TOO MANY RUBBER BODIES BLEEDING AND EXPLODING!  UGH, THOSE LIGHTENING FLASHES ARE SO OBVIOUSLY ANIMATED AFTER THE FACT!  Doesn't look real!!!!!  Yeah, CGI is a modern too.  This film didn't overuse it, and it certainly didn't employ it more than the original films employed the special effects tricks they needed to make their story work.  Whether or not the CGI was good or bad is another debate.  Some was great(love the saucer rising at the end), and other times it looked like what it was(some of the jungle action).  You could say the same about the effects in the original.  If Spielberg had access to CGI effects back in the 80's he would've employed them.  It's that simple.  Modern times, modern techniques.  Again, sounding like a broken record, WHO CARE, HONESTLY?<br /><br />Finally, we get to the dreaded quick sand.  Okay, yeah, it was silly.  I was under the impression that it was suppoed to be silly.  I swear that was the idea.  So, you're mad at the film for doing what it set out to do?  Ooookay.  It's no more silly of a comic relief or contrivance then smart monkeys that are smart enough to posion your dates but no smart enough to avoid eating them.  No more silly than spike traps, that are overly elaborate, in an underground cavern being accidentally activated, or an old-timer libraryian mistaking his stamps smack for a pole being smashed into the library floor.  You see?  Your nit-picks can be done to the whole series!!!!!<br /><br />Well, that's the best I can see as far as an overview of what the most common complaints are.  Now, lets get into what is ACTUALLY wrong with this film.  Okay, the Marion subplot was rushed and never fully developed in a meaningful  way. They did a much better job with the son plot.  The two characters argue and then the action moves in.  They never share a legitimate moment.  This is the only subplot in ANY Indy movie where one would HAVE to have seen the first film to enjoy or get a lot out of.  The powers and connection of the crystal skull to the real life Hedges skull.  This is done through loborious dialogue.  Indy films are lite on dialogue.  This one is not.  There's too many scenes of characters explaining the rules or the powers.  Indy being blacklisted doesn't go anywhere.  It's set up but it doesn't pay off.  It is just dropped.  John Williams score is very MEH.  In the three previous films he creates a theme for each film to go with the original Indy theme.  I'll be damned, but I can't find one in this film.  The best parts of the music are taken from Crusade or Raiders.  Kind of a bummer and a lazy effort on his part.  The double agent subplot is too shoehorned.  It's not subtle or truly surprising but kind of eye rolling.  If we had time to get to know the character played by Ray Winstone, Mac, better than maybe there could've been some genuine surprise or tragedy to it, but NOPE. When the aliens finally appear in the flesh the look really derivative.  They're your basic gray guys made famous on The X-Files.  Finally, the ending, and the main villain's demise is a little too similar to what happens at the end of Raiders. That's really about it for the film's REAL faults.<br /><br />This is a pretty good  action/fantasy film.  I love the whole 50's style sci-fi bent.  I'm glad the ship stayed in true 50's fashion and was a saucer.  The sets, as usual with an Indy film, are beautiful to behold.  I love this stuff, dark caverns, old crypts, booby-traps, etc.  Harrison Ford manages to look comfortable in action despite his 66 years of age, and wears the Indy persona like an old, but beloved glove.  His relationship with his son is fun.  He has one great scene with Marion right before he climbs the top of a truck to stop a convoy.  The action scenes are wild and funny just like the other Indy films.  I love the Amazon truck chase that leads to a fist fight amongst giant killer ants.  Spielberg had to revert to his old 80's style of filmmaking for this(nowadays he seems to prefer more washed out colors and grain) and the movie is awesomely photographed and fits in stylistically with the previous entries.  The plots and artifacts for the Indiana Jones franchise are always moot.  They're like James Bond films.  They're excuse for special effects, action, and exotic locations, real and unreal.  All the Indy films basically have the same plot one way or another.  I love this flick and it was great to see Indy again, and would love to see him once more.  If you're 'jonesing' too, check out the Mystery of the Blues episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(or as it is now called The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones).  Harriso Ford plays Indy in 1950 for an opening and ending bookend to this episode.  It's really a good ep plus a nice bonus to see Ford as a bearded Indy.<br /><br />Lighten up and enjoy people.  Obviously, you took these films more serious the the filmmakers intended.  I guess maybe most of you saw these films when you were really young and put too much emphasis on the maguffins or thought they were deep.  I assure you Spielberg and Lucas didn't.  Hell, Spielberg hated the Holy Grail idea, hence why he added the finding his father plot to that film.  He made Last Crusade about that and barely paused over some silly cup-o-Christ.  Maybe you should do the same.  The titles of every film in this series should make you smile at their blunt and silly nature.  Just say them out loud.  See, smiling.  If you're still a child at heart, and you are still in touch with the REAL reason these films are beloved enjoy Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.<br /><br />PS: Almost forgot about my favorite aspect of Crystal Skull bashing!!!!  The famous 'raped Indy' episode of South Park.  It amazes me that nerdy fanboys didn't get this one.  South Park was making fun of YOU!!!!  Not the movie.  It was making fun of the fact that there was such an over reaction to this film.  That was the joke of 'raped Indy'.  Did you not get that?

B0015DROBO|3.0|I'm going to make this very brief and in \\"talking point\\" style:<br /><br />1. Overall, a fairly decent read, but does not live up to the hype, and clearly many others agree.  I have no intention of continuing the series.<br />2. The exposition alone is several hundred pages, but the ending was a clich&eacute;, by-the-numbers letdown, not commensurate with the large build up.  The book is at least 100 pages too long.<br />3. The translation is very choppy in many paragraphs (or perhaps the author is to blame).<br />4. Following all the names, specifically the Vanger family, was somewhat frustrating, particularly during the first half.  Believe me, you'll want to bookmark the page with the Vanger family tree.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT - THE FOLLOWING IS FOR THOSE WHO FINISHED THE BOOK:<br />1. I'm amazed at how clich&eacute; the ending was: a serial killer in the family, a basement dungeon - are you kidding me?<br />2. The fact that Harriet Vanger was alive all along was quite predictable from the start.  The whole plot device of escaping one life and moving far away and beginning a new one is so unoriginal, especially with the huge, detailed exposition.  If you're going to build it up that much, the ending needs to be intense and captivating.

Her greatest voices are absent here and she sings in an uninspiring manner. I kept waiting for her to work those lungs or hear some electric guitars but nooooooo. I'm just rambling here because I really did want to dig this album like I've liked her previous albums (from Dry to Uh Huh Her but it's just boring. I suppose the lyrics can be found interesting at times but, regardless, spare yourself from the torturous listen. Watch the Please Leave Quietly DVD which is awesome live PJ and forget about this latest drag.
0811876373|5.0|Excellent book!  Purchased as a gift for a gal who made cake pops for me for my birthday party.  Well written with excellent pictures.  The designs may be intimidating for the person new to cake pops and will not look as polished as those depicted but practice makes perfect.  There are plenty of designs that will lead you to your own personal ideas.  Plenty of tips on how to achieve the perfect pop outcome.  Book is easy to use, lays flat and cleans up easily if there are any 'accidents'.  Would highly recommennd!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought his book yesterday - How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months! - and read the whole thing in an hour.    Part of what he is talking about I have used in setting up my website/blog. He has a system to take your books and make them huge. I don't know if what he does will work for everyone but it cant hurt to try.     Every self pubbed author should read this book. This is not a magic bullet solution, its a marketing strategy, one he has used successfully.    Why would he tell everyone what he has done? Why share this? Is he just trying to sell one more book, is this a gimmick?    These are all fair questions.     My answer: what he is selling is a strategy, its like learning how to sell. Some people do it well, make it look effortless, others  find it hard to master. The strategy he has will not stop his core audience from buying his books but reading this might help you find your core audience.    Why am I having such a rave about this? I had an Oprah aha moment reading this book.  I dont think that I will be alone in that. It sounds cheesy but do yourself a favour and have your aha moment.    Cheers  Nadine
B0012DZ356|2.0|This book was extremely boring. I forced myself to read the first half of the book and had to stop. If I have to force myself to read something then its not worth reading. Munro is a good writer but the stories are depressing and boring at best. I was trying to figure out what was going on most of the time. I would finish one story and tell myself to keep going and maybe the next one would be better but they didnt get much better and I finally gave up.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|Received the set in damaged condition.  It was obvious that the cases holding the DVD's were damaged BEFORE they were shrink wrapped, leading me to believe I was intentionally shipped damaged goods.  The DVD's themselves have all worked so far, so at least I have the series.  The shipper \\"Bookgrovemedia\\" gave me a $20 credit to keep the set.  My other option with them was to return the set for a refund, which would have left me without the set at all.  Overall, I would be careful about purshasing from this vendor.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I bought the mp3 album when it was a $0.99   and loved it. I also ordered the Born This Way Special Edition CD and couldn't be happier. There are so many great songs on this album. I love every single song on this album and the remixes... I love anything Lady Gaga.. Loved every single song and video of hers. Buy This album... So put your paws up because you were BORN THIS WAY BABY....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Extremely fun bourd game.  Its a little like monopoly, only better.  This game take strategy, patience, and a little luck.  Very, very   fun game, plus it has expansion packs to add new challenges and   experiences.
B004132HZS|5.0|I adored this show. Absolutely! I was just introduced to it by a friend from England and I am SO happy they did. Not only was it snarky, intelligent, but it kept the same tone that I had felt when reading the books as a child. I love anything and everything Sherlock Holmes and this show was a delight. I am very happy to hear that the show will be returning this upcoming year. I hope it has more than just 3 episodes as one never gets enough of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson, Detective Inspector Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Ann(John's lady friend), Molly(the mortician) with her quiet, mouse-y crush on Holmes, and yes, even Mycroft will be a sight for sore eyes in this next season. I loved this and if you love anything to do with Sherlock Holmes then this modern day rendition of a great character will draw you in. It's worth it.
B004I654WQ|4.0|Great movie and good combo disc but no Digital Copy.  As some mentioned, you can purchase a online viewing from Disney website for $5.99 but that's not like actually getting a digital copy on your iTunes to put it on iPhones, iPad, or iPod...etc (which doesn't require internet to watch movie).  If you have other Disney movies with Digital Copy you can register them and get the online viewing for free.  Unless you really need this movie now I recommend waiting for Cars 1 & 2 Combo package.  I'm sure digital copy will be included and movies will be 3D.
0345529057|1.0|I feel like i've been duped.  prices for ebooks have more than doubled since i bought my devise less than a year ago.  this is getting ridiculous.  I want to read these books though so i guess i will purchase a used paperback version so the publisher won't make any money off of me. i would have bought the kindle version but this is ridiculous.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Imagine a 3rd rate Men In Black movie starring Van Wilder with sub-par CGI! That's Green Lantern in a nutshell. This movie is the worst movie of 2011. Abysmal on all levels.
159102594X|1.0|I'll keep this brief: This book (The Blade Itself) is a fascinating, gripping read, with strong characters and difficult situations.  And on the strength of the first book I bought the rest of the series.  A mistake.  The second book (Before They Are Hanged) drug on like one of Glokta's questioning sessions.  And the third book (Last Argument of Kings) was a complete failure for me.  I'm regretting these books, and hope the used bookstore will kindly take them off my hands.
0385342055|4.0|Ok, I agree with the majority that at times Becky's shopping and the craziness she creates gets to be a bit much.  But at the same time, I think that is her charm.  It is the essence of who Becky is, and that craziness is why we fell in love with her in the first place.  It wouldn't be her if she wasn't doing all of the scheming, plotting, shopping, and making her 'People will call her The Girl Who............' statements.  I still find enjoyment in Becky's stories, and will keep reading them as long as Kinsella keeps writing them.
B002ZG9788|3.0|to be fair this movie is almost impossible to make in any way that won't strain your willing suspension of disbelief. so, let's get the absurdity of the movie's basic premise out of the way. the gods, the old ones, not the more spiritual new ones who know better, need mankind's belief and love in order to exist. okay, not that original, but an interesting idea except that there is no need for any kind of faith when these gods walk around visibly and destructively among us. even goldman sachs manages to stay somewhat hidden as it wields power and wreaks havoc. not so these gods, especially their pet kraken. there might have been a more workable storyline built on whether these gods deserved our trust. but no matter. these gods are just men with way too much power. and it's never quite clear just how much power the demigods, like perseus and io, have. more in the range of superstar athletes, i guess. but to enjoy the movie, which you can, you need to shove all this behind you. like satanic conspiracy movies like \\"damien\\" where you have to forget that there is also an all-mighty and righteous god logically somewhere in the background.     still, there is a lot to like about the movie. perseus is honorable and cool. andromeda is wonderful, both beautiful and compassionate, and seemingly to good to refuse on any grounds. the medusa is also beautiful, and deadly, with that great hairdo of tiny serpents. the giant scorpion creatures are also deadly and a nice setup for the later real-time monster in the kraken. on the good-guy side the pegasus is quite well done and its flight/fight abilities very effective.     the love story is so minimal you wonder why they bothered, and there is no real chemistry between perseus and io, which is nearly canceled by both the beauty and magnetism of andromeda. you'd think someone would figure out that even in these costume-epics they don't have to reduce women to cardboard cutouts.     with plenty of flaws that might distract you, i sayforget all that and enjoy the action and the good things that the movie offers, and forget the embarrassing absurdity of the gods, their pretentious mannered dialog and even more pretentious costuming. why does zeus need armor, anyway?
076781326X|1.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas and when she finally decided to watch it we discovered that only the 2nd half of the movie was on the DVD. Very disappointing. Unfortunately, because she hadn't tried to watch it before now it is too late to get a full refund and we would have to pay for the shipping.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|If you liked the Bee Gees, this 2 CD set will have you saying I forgot they did that song it was great!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game and it plays great on my Nexus 4g. But I've lost my saved progress twice now. So frustrating to have to start over in level one. Please fix. I love this game!
B004EC5IUW|4.0|As a fan of the original series, I find that there is a lot to this relaunch to enjoy.  The visuals are amazing and the story takes some different turns form the original.    However, if I had not already watched the original series, I think that I would find the story to be a bit lacking.  There is not much character development, and much of the content which made the original so interesting, is missing.  I assume that the constraints of getting the series out in only four parts is the reason, but this lack of content it is unfortunate.    As an aside, both this disc and the 1.1.1 disc have difficulties being recognized by my PS3.  I sometimes have to eject and put them back in 3-4 times before the PS3 reads them.  I have no issues like this with any other Blu-Ray discs that I own.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|This is one of those horror films that stand the test of time. I loved it when it first came out and had to have it in my home collection. By today's standards, this movie is cheesy but makes for good watching.
1400079276|4.0|I picked this book with the expectation of reading something different. I wasn't disappointed. Murakami's greatness is not in the prose or in the structure, but in the story itself. With simple language and lots of dialogs, he delivers a compelling novel, deep with meaning and interesting intersections. Like many readers, I was wondering what kind of novel this is while reading the book. And it's true that it's hard to define. At the end I had the feeling of looking at a painting and imagining a fairy tale from it. The end of the book hints in this direction, but you will find much more here.<br /><br />The one big complain I have is that the characters don't always come across as convincing as they should. This may be a translation issue (I read the French version), but it still subtract from an otherwise very convincing narrative. Great novels make you fall for its characters, love them, hate them, emphasize with them. There is greatness in this book, but some deficiencies still remain.
B004FOA84A|5.0|It was a fun game knew it would be short but felt it was definitely worth it.  Wish there was a sequal or more games like this one.  Would even be willing to pay more fore game like this with more game play time to it.
1439190275|5.0|I already had the previous book by Dr. Atkins, this is a good supplement with more information and views with more recent updates on the whole issue of carbs in our diets.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|If you want a great collection from a great band this is it. This is their songs that anyone who listens to rock radio will know everyone. I honestly am not a greatest hits type because there are so many good songs not ever to make it to the radio and are discovered on the original recording. What I wanted was to introduce the Foo Fighters to my kids and this collection is perfect for that.
B001F1YBP8|4.0|this is a very nice presentation of the Brandenburg Concertos, I just don't like the faster tempos. I like to hear each instrument. It is worth the money. Purchase the Blu-ray because the image quality is spectacular.thank you
B0032FPVKE|4.0|This is suitable for one really small camcorder and not much else.     It's nicely built, but I really recommend you measure your camcorder carefully and take into account other accessories like batteries, tapes/cards, charger that you might want to put into the bag. Chances are they won't all fit.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|Wonderful French Comedy!<br /><br />You don't have to understand French to enjoy this gem of a movie. The basic plot is based on a dinner game put on by a group of friends. Each person at the dinner must bring an idiot as a guest, the best idiot wins! Pierre is sure he has found the biggest idiot for the dinner, but there is only one problem. He has injured his back and is unable to go to the dinner. What follows is an enjoyable slapstick comedy of errors with perfect comedic timing. The rest you simply have to see for yourself!<br /><br />I enjoy watching foreign films, but there are only a few that I enjoy so much that I simply must own it to watch again and again... The Dinner Game is on the top of my list!
B003E8P9G0|1.0|i dont realy like this book  it also shows two very unmature siblings bickering and fighting  i also think the bok was too dramatic and i always had to go back and reread again before i understood what the author ment  if your the type of person that gets very umpatient and doesnt like to reread dont read this book

I've been doing it now for a few months and I am currently 24 weeks pregnant, and it still works well for me. She moves things along quickly and doesn't stay on one position too long. Perfect for the pregnant mom that wants to do more than stretch! :)

0439023513|5.0|Well, Suzanne Collins has just written one of the best series of books I've ever read. Not to mention my favorite. I hope I can write my review tomorrow because I need to voice my thoughts on this, everything's jumbled and, well, I'm trying to sort myself out right now. Dripping nose, puffy red eyes... I must be a wreck. I want to start now but anything I write might be a bunch of incoherent rambling due to my exhaustion. REVIEW TOMMOROW *crosses fingers tightly*     That was my initial reaction to Mockingjay, written sometime between three and four in the morning. After that, I  laid my head on my pillow, and just thought about all of the characters that I love so much. Katniss, her strength and compassion. Peeta, his way with words and kindness. Gale, his passion and straightforwardness. Finnick, his humor and AWESOMENESS. I could go on and on.... and on. Before I knew it, I was sobbing, again. I've never shed so many tears for a book, hell, for a book series! And there were seven Harry Potter books. I just felt it. I kept on laughing to myself that I was crazy for caring SO much about fictional characters, but then again, why would anyone read if you didn't love who the people were woven in the story. I came to the conclusion I am NOT crazy for caring, I would be crazy if I didn't care. So, there. This book is like riding the Knight Bus. You're going full speed, until a little old lady crosses the street and SCREEEEEECH. You stop dead, your face slams into the glass painfully, the seconds tick by, and then your off again, dodging traffic. One more thing before the spoilers begin, I've never been Team Peeta or Team Gale. I like both, equally. I didn't care who Katniss ended up with because she had good reason to choose either. I didn't even care if she chose to stay alone. I just wanted her to be happy, she deserved it more than anyone. I loved Mockingjay.
B004J4WQ46|2.0|With \\"Is This It?\\" the Strokes made one of the best records of the new century. Following albums were good but got gradually worse. After a long hiatus \\"Angles\\" came out and unfortunately it fits neatly into that line.  Opener `Machu Picchu' can only endear in the chorus, but the empty 80's pop sound is annoying. This hollow sound is continued in `Two Kinds of Happiness' and basically throughout the album    It's not all bad. The single `Under Cover of Darkness' makes up a lot. It's a vintage Strokes song with both strong verses and chorus and where every instrument sounds great. `Taken for a Fool' has a great chorus as well but these are sparse highlight on a disappointing album.
1400034205|5.0|The Razors Edge is a book I had read many years ago. I wanted to share it with my granddaughter, who is a great reader, so I ordered a copy for each of us.  The book did not disappoint the second time around. It is one of those \\"thinker\\" books.  Try it. It's a short read and I think you'll enjoy it.  Donna
0553386794|1.0|So, how to be different in the fantasy genre?  By killing off good people, making so-called good people almost on par with the evil ones.  To see the world as half empty instead of half full - and write that way.  To display mankind in all of its ugliness, and never let up.  To see the mole on a beautiful woman's face, and concentrate only on the mole.  If that is what you want to read in a series, this series, and this author is for you.<br /><br />In a way, it is like wanting to write a different kind of romance novel where the romance turns out to be an ugly divorce, from a crude, vulgar person you weren't even attracted to.  Yes, that is a different.  It is unique.  It is also a horrible read.<br /><br />George Martin has established that he can be different, and treat this genre differently - but that is about it.<br /><br />When I read 'fantasy', I like \\"fantasy.\\"  We all know what the real world is like, in all of its vulgarity.  We see it every day.  But when we read an entertaining story that takes us to a different world where good is good, and evil is evil, that escape from the grayness of our world is refreshing and enjoyable.  The Lord of the Rings was such a series - and an excellent one.<br /><br />If you are feeling particularly good about your life, and think you need a reminder that life is not always so nice, then plop down and read this series.  You should be thoroughly depressed by the time you are done.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|I'm a big fan of The Killers.  Honestly, I was very skeptical about this album but once I gave it a shot, I was impressed!  Not only does the album sounds very differently than The Killers' material, it is also fresh, amusing, and full of brilliant moments.  I took this album for a long trip and now it is stuck in head; full of memories of a great moments, accompanied by great music!  Cannot wait for the next Killers album,... followed by the second album of Mr Flowers.  Enjoy!
B004UHF51S|5.0|Oh, I`ve waited for this release so long. My expectations were extremely high, and (mind you) I`m by no means dissappointed. The music is none short of excellent (the solos are pure genius), the lyrics - brilliant, sensuous and witty at the same time. As always.   However, being a tune-oriented guy, I must admit, the only ones I can recall and whistle after repeated listening (at least 15-20 spins in the last week or so) are just \\"Now that the summer`s here\\" and \\"Charlie Chan in Egypt\\"... The remaining ones are simply not that memorable IMHO. That is the only let-down here.       Keeping that in mind, I would rate Michael`s previous release (somehow a lot of other reviewers tend to forget about it) - \\"Rendezvous in Rio\\" a lot higher, and consider it his another masterpiece - right up there with \\"Tiger in the rain\\".
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This is a great series!  Nice to have the dvd's so I can pause the show when getting phone calls.  I will watch them over and over.  Love Amazon's service!!! kgs
B004MOMT2M|5.0|I received this item so very quickly.  I guess since the title of the band is Rush, well the shipping carrier must have just known this is important and we need to get this to the buyer asap.  Whatever it was, I am happy.  How could I not be happy? -I have the new release of Rush Moving Pictures remastered, remixed, and whats not to like about that?
B0054JURZA|5.0|Um... Excellent.    Beautifully updated from the debut's simple sound, without compromising intimate feel.     Will be on repeat for some time.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS VIDEO AFTER I SAW THE MOVIE ON TELEVISION. I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE, WHICH IS A MUSICAL SET IN THE LATE 1960s. THE STORY IS VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER, AND THE MUSIC IS ALL YOUR FAVORITE BEATLES SONGS. I RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYED THE BEATLES. IT IS VERY EASY TO WATCH!
055357342X|5.0|Brief summary and review, spoiler warnings.<br /><br />By now I am assuming anyone reading these reviews has read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]] and [[ASIN:0553381695 A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)]].<br /><br />I don't have too much to add in terms of summarizing plot other than to say that the story continues with the various plots and intrigue of the various Houses in the land of Westeros and beyond. We further follow the Lannisters vs. Starks, as well as following Daenerys in her quest to return to Westeros and regain the Iron Throne. The Battle of Blackwater has taken place and it looks bad for the House of Stark and for Stannis Baratheon, but just you wait...<br /><br />What I did want to say and to add,  was that this was my favorite book of the series so far - because of what so many people refer to as the OMG moment. I will not give any spoilers - but suffice it to say that there is a shocking development in this book, and it literally had me gasp. I hadn't felt this way since Ned's and Drago's death in book one. For those of you who may have found yourself struggling a bit through book 2 (not me but many of my friends), I urge you to hang in there. Sword of Storms, in my opinion, is less battle scenes (like book 2) and more a focus on the characters and their scheming.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0470876417|5.0|This is a great book! I came across Osterwalder's work back when it was still an article/report in 2007 and it was already very insightful and useful then, but this book just takes his high quality work to a whole different level. I am so happy to have this book at just the right time. It's an excellent way to visualize the composition of the business and to put each department's and employee's contribution into context. This is especially beneficial for our company since it's distributed and it's harder to get a sense of oneness and individual purpose without a very well designed tool like the business model canvas.
0553582038|4.0|Brief summary and spoiler warnings.<br /><br />I am assuming this review is for those who have already read the previous books in the series -[[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]],  [[ASIN:0553381695 A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)]], and [[ASIN:055357342X A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)]]<br /><br />Before I had read this book, I had heard it was the weakest of the series. In some ways that's true, but for different reasons. It's not that the story has gone astray as much as Martin has admittedly left out a big chunk of the tale - in particular the story from the POV's of Daenerys,  Jon and Tyrion (my favorite character.) Also we don't hear from Davos or really from Stannis as well. Instead the book branches off and tells more about the Ironmen  and the House Greyjoy and their attempts at dominion and conquest. We also learn a lot more about Dorne and the House Martell, and find out about the families there and their own inner conflicts about who is to rule, and how to get revenge for their Prince, the Red Viper, who died at the hands of Ser Gregor Clegane at the end of the last book.  We also follow Sansa and the ingenious and ambitious Littlefinger, as they deal with the fallout of Lysa's death at the Eerie. And we learn about the Sparrows - the religious followers of the Seven Gods who's religious fervor are a little too reminiscent of a certain Spanish Inquisition...<br /><br />We do get plenty of story from Jaime, Cercei and Brienne. Whereas Jaime becomes a more sympathetic character, Cercei seems to gone off the rails into either madness and paranoia or both. We also follow Ayra, and although it appears her story has stalled a bit, there is a shocking twist that happens to her - whether permanent or not we'll just have to see.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book a lot, although as Martin admits it's obvious it's really just part of a longer book because he's left out some main players. Still, it's very enjoyable, and as with the other books in this series I was sucked into the story and into the world and I am REALLY looking forward to [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] I am so glad I just read these books because I think I would be helplessly lost if there had been much of a gap between my reading of the books.as with the other books in this series I was sucked into the story and into the world and I am REALLY looking forward to [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] I am so glad I just read these books because I think I would be helplessly lost if there had been much of a gap between my reading of the books.

B000002AZ8|4.0|Another good album by Pearl Jam. Its an album i recommend all the grunge fans to have. Its not so good as their first 2 but its a good one to have.
B00544L9EI|4.0|Royce da 5'9\\" and Eminem just released their new EP Hell the Sequel. Its pretty much horrorcore all the way through, but it does have some good songs for the pop rap fans as well.   1. Welcome 2 Hell: 4/5 This is a fantastic song but the reason it gets deducted a point is because it lacks a hook which is kind of disappointing.  2. Fast Lane: 5/5 Simply amazing. Royce KILLS this song. Absolutely fantastic.   3. The Reunion: 3/5 Its a decent song with a lackluster hook. The beat is good, but I've heard better.  4. Above the Law: 5/5 The hook isn't that great, but its still a fantastic song that you should defiantly listen to.  5. I'm on Everything: 3/5 The biggest problem with this song is that it just seems lazy. The beat is kind of lame, the lyrics are stupid. But its not terrible. There is a lot better out there.  6. A Kiss: 3/5 I love the beat but the hook absolutely destroys the song. Its awful. They could have done a lot better.  7. Lighters: 5/5 Bruno Mars + Eminem should equal epic failure, but this is one of the 3 best songs on the album.   8. Take From Me: 4/5 Another lame hook. Great beat makes up for it though.  9. Loud Noises: 3/5 The definition of horrorcore. But the repetitive beat wear it down a lot.  10. Living Proof: 5/5 Awesome. Best beat on the album put this up there with Lighters and Fast Lane.  11. Echo: 4/5 Why can't they make a good hook? just wondering. Other than that, its a good song.    This is an album of awesome beats with for the most part terrible hooks. They could have done better especially after 10 or more years. Oh well, its worth listening to. Final Score: 6/10 (Not an average score)
B0000028UK|4.0|THis album is one of their best (Well not like Ten but close enough).Its a good place to start also if you are new to Pearl Jam. Its a very good album for relaxing and i prefer listening this album in my car when i travel. If you like grunge music then this is amust album that i highly recommend. Very good work.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|I saw this toy in a magazine. It was recommended for tummy time. Since my baby hates being on her tummy, I thought this might encourage more tummy time; which she needs for development. I can say this, it is very durable! I put it on her high chair tray and she knocked it off on the floor. I just knew it was broken. It was perfectly fine. It isn't one of her favorite toys, but it is somewhat entertaining, but not for long periods of time.
067960085X|4.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's - an American icon film. But before it was a film, Capote created Holly Golightly on the page with Marilyn Monroe on his mind. If you've seen the film, Monroe in the role may seem a bit off, but when you read the novella, it is DEAD ON!<br /><br />Holly Golightly is a woman of the world who lives by her own rules, if she even knows what they are. She represents the beginning of a cultural sexual revolution, and Capote develops her in a caring way. While we may not always agree with her lifestyle choices (including some of her dialogue), we as readers respect them because they come from an icon.<br /><br />Unless you love to read classics or you're already a Capote fan, I would say skip this novella.

They can be worn not only sockless, but also with a heavy sock in the winter! We purchased the Navy/Gargoyle color this time because Amazon had that color on sale! There are many imitations of the 'real thing' but none as comfortable and as good a value!
B004289ZW0|1.0|I strongly recommend against purchasing this unit from Amazon or its resellers. It had a known defect in the on/off capacitance switch that was supposedly fixed with a software upgrade on all units shipped since February 2011.    However, the unit that I received had this defect out of the box.     I am especially angry at Amazon and its reseller because I paid extra money for fast shipping only to receive a defective unit, and now I not only have to spend my time returning the unit, I have to rush around to find an alternative before I leave on a trip.    I strongly recommend against purchasing this unit from Amazon, and there is nothing to recommend it over alternatives.     Overall, a miserable experience.

0446563048|4.0|This book is an enjoyable read full of lessons, if you can excuse the author's sophmoric philosophy towards team building and the ridiculous blend of fonts which made reading this book more of a chore than it should have been.<br /><br />I found two themes interesting. First, Zappos breaks many of the traditional rules about supply chain management. Zappos treats their vendors as partners. They share sales forecast information, collaborate on merchandising strategies and negotiate fair pricing which enables them to continue to innovate. Early on they tried outsourcing fulfillment and learned the valuable lesson to never outsource your core competency. As an e-commerce company they should have considered warehousing to be a core competency and trusting a third party to care about their customers as much as they would have was one of their first big mistakes, which they quickly corrected.<br /><br />The second theme I found interesting related to marketing. Tony explains how excellent customer service can be the key to great publicity. Happy customers will build brand awareness through word-of-mouth marketing.<br /><br />Zappos became a billion-dollar business in less than 10 years by putting the customer first. They did it by delivering WOW to customers, in the form of service that exceeds expectations by providing an experience people are eager to tell others about. By \\"delivering happiness,\\" Zappos ensures many millions of dollars in repeat and referral business every year.<br /><br />Zappos has been built around 3 key areas and what they believe is their competitive advantage:<br />1. Customer service, (which would build their brand)<br /><br />They consider a call center to be an untapped opportunity and the âaetelephone one of the best branding devises out there.â They run their call center very differently than most. They donâ(tm)t measureâcall timesâ and they never up-sell or use scripts. They just care about whether a rep goes above and beyond for every customer. It's a testament to Zappos that they acknowledge sometimes the best way of delighting a customer is by talking to them. People never forget how you make them feel - WOWed customers will visit again and buy more.<br /><br />2. Culture, (which would lead to formulating core values)<br /><br />They did an interesting and in my mind, a risky thing; they asked all their employees to e-mail 100-500 words about what the Zappos culture meant to them (What is the Zappo's culture? Whatâ(tm)s different about it from other places you have worked? What do you like about it? What does it mean to you?) and compiled it into a mini book which was distributed to all new hires and employees. They censored none of the entries, except for typos and included the good and the bad.<br /><br />They not only list their 10 Core Values but they list questions each employee should ask themselves about each value. They go on to recommend specific books to employees that address each core value. (All books are stocked in the Zappos library and are free to guests and employees and their family with the only requirement being: if you take a book, you must read it.)<br /><br />3. Employee development (which led to the creation of their Pipeline Team)<br /><br />Rather than focus on individuals as assets, they focus on building as their asset, a pipeline of people in every single department with varying levels of skills and experience. They hire at the entry level and over the course of seven years, employees are required to take set courses in order to be promoted regardless of which department he or she is in. The pipeline is then filled in every department and when an individual leaves there will always be someone right behind him to take over his responsibilities.<br /><br />As Tony writes, everything else can be replicated but if you have âaecommitted employees, passionately serving customers and constantly developing themselves, you have a competitive advantage in your market.â<br/><br />They have built an in-depth selection process around hiring the right candidates using behavioral interviewing methodology and their list of 10 Tips to Make Sure Your Next New Hire Is a Culture Fit is a list that many organizations could edit and re-use.<br />Here are three takeaways OF THE BOOK:<br /><br />1. Advertise less. Retain and resell more<br />Early on, Zappos chose to spend more on getting current customers to buy again and more frequently, than on convincing strangers to buy. They did this by making customer service the focus of the company.<br /><br />2. Deliver WOW<br />Hsieh believes that people remember experiences longer and more fondly than things. So Zappos delivers an experience, from the moment you hit the web site or call their customer service number, to the confirmation emails you get and the box that arrives on your doorstep (often faster than you expected.)<br /><br />3. Money is not enough<br />Great companies have a purpose and a vision beyond just making money.ioral interviewing methodology and their list of 10 Tips to Make Sure Your Next New Hire Is a Culture Fit is a list that many organizations could edit and re-use.

B000PMLFRA|2.0|This is straight from the PR folks at Lucasfilm:      The Blu-ray discs will feature the 1997, 2000, and 2003 versions of the film, with additional edits made by the filmmaker. There is now one definitive version of the films thanks to technological advances, which have made it possible to achieve the visual effects the filmmaker originally intended. This will be the version released on Blu-ray.      So I hope this answers some questions.

0240815807|5.0|\\"Mixing Secrets for the small studio\\" by Mike Senior is a must read for anyone who wants to venture into the world of home recording and mixing or for anyone already on their journey that needs a helping hand and a better understanding of the tools at their disposal as well as their proper use.<br /><br /> The opening section of this book is the worth the price of admission itself and is something I wish I would've read before investing into my own home studio gear.  Principally, the section addresses near field monitors and includes explanations on style, construction, placement, room acoustics and features as well as marketing features to steer clear of.  I better understand my own setup after reading the opening chapters and know immediately how to remedy a few acoustic problems I've been having, but was unaware of their source.<br /><br /> Beyond setup and the basics, many topics are covered that are essential to mixing such as compression, EQ, panning, effects, dynamics, stereo vs. mono, automation and mix down. Beyond the core skills and tools mentioned above are insider tips and industry tricks of the trade to achieve certain sounds or styles as well as specific song and album references to hear how certain things were accomplished by established industry mixing engineers on famous albums from Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" to Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\".<br /><br /> This book is excellent as both a first read for beginners as well as a good reference manual or \\"continuing education\\" approach to the novice and experienced alike. I found the book straight forward and written in plain English as much as is possible when discussing some fairly complicated matters of acoustic science and technological subject matter. I found the end of chapter summaries of key points helpful and I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't consider themselves an expert on the subject matter.
0439023521|3.0|I am taken aback by the number of people who have given this book a 5 star.  This book is average at best.  I can understand how this book can get you excited if you are 16 or younger and don't do much reading past High School English class assignments, or haven't watched enough movies, but if you are a person who reads and has lived and you still give this book a 5 star than I am shocked.    The book, from beginning to end, feels like the writer had actually written a movie script but turned it into a novel at the last minute.  The scene where Katniss begs Thresh for her life, movie cliche.  The scene where where Clove is trying to kill Katniss, gosh that was sooooo cliche.  I could go on and on but I don't want to give the book away.  All this movie lacked was for Cato to be impelled after falling from something high or a few car explosions Michael bay style from 5 angles and we would have a complete cliche set.  This book will make a horrible movie unless they can deviate from the book a lot and take the cliches out.  On screen you can't hide them.    This book is just a poor rehashing of better books.  Battle Royale comes to mind. The writer was a bit lazy with her writing and it shows on almost every page. When your reader, at least I could, can anticipate everything that is coming in your book chapters ahead, you are doing something wrong.     Hopefully there is less cliches in the other books. But this books is not 5 star material. Not in this world. I give it a 3 because it's average and the writer is a good writer, but just got lazy.

I was just blown away at how many layers he creates within his music.  He finds the perfect singers to create a mood and sound that are just hypnotic.    I've read reviews stating his newest effort \\"Destroyed\\" is boring.  While there is a definite chill mood to the CD, it is without a doubt a brilliant sonic landscape of sound.  I like the idea that this music was composed in the hours that most would be sleeping.  Moby states he has insomnia and this album was the result of that time awake.  Whatever it is, I just love it!  I definitely recommend this CD.  Just Brilliant!

I can't beleive the lack of nutritional information our Doctors get, and how quick they are to the knife or the bottle. It's almost disgusting.

1591843790|4.0|While I tend to reserve the 5 star ratings for all-time classics (such as The Art of the Start by Kawasaki), this book came close to getting 5 stars from me.  It's full of helpful tips and reminders.  It's really well written, easy to read, and helpful.  Kawasaki tells it like it IS, not how a business beginner WANTS to hear it.    If you're browsing and you read through the editorial reviews and you got this far, you should probably read this book.

B000QJLQY4|5.0|I don't give many 5 star reviews...but this is a GREAT book.    If you're going to start a business, you should read this book.  You should probably also read Gerber's E-Myth stuff.  They are, in my opinion, full of important, usable information that would be beneficial to most start up entrepreneurs.    Keep in mind that most start-ups tend to be smaller than conventional wisdom would suggest.  About 76% of ALL businesses have 5 or fewer employees.  About 95 % of all businesses do less than $500K in revenues.  Kawasaki does, in my opinion, a great job of providing information that applies to a wide range of start-ups, including the typically small ones.    Of all the books I've read in the last five years, this one might be the one that most impacted the way that I consult with start-up businesses.  I really appreciate the pitch-then-plan concept and the focus on projecting cash flow over profit and loss.  I also think Kawasaki does a great job of coming from a tech background but sharing advice that is just as applicable to a hair salon, restaurant, or plumber.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster team up again one final time for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. This movie takes place after Fast and Furious. The film brings the crew back together in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil for one last job to get their freedom before disappearing forever. Some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Matt Schulze (Vince -The Fast and Furious) and Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift) all return for one of the most action packed Fast and Furious movies ever. They are faced with a tough federal agent Luke Hoobs (the Rock) who will stop at nothing to hunt them down. I will not give away any more but, I'm happy to say Fast Five does not disappoint. This Movie is action packed from start to finish, and even though it has many over the top moments it is still one heck of an enjoyable action ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this new and final installment will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out! Im going to miss Paul and Vin and all the crew, but will be forever thankful for all the awesome Fast films they brought us and am happy to watch them again and again on DVD or blu-ray! Fast Five [Blu-ray]<br /><br />Be sure and stay for the end credits for a unexpected twist.
0812973992|3.0|The theme of this novel is a high wire walk between the two tallest WTC towers in 1974. Between well-researched descriptions of the walker's preparation and the walk itself there are stories about various fictional characters from the same time. The author's own tale of arriving from Ireland and living in New York in the early 70s also forms a part.     What I found reading this was that the narrative didn't seem believable. They're fictional characters of course, but I didn't find they were representative in that too many were prostitutes or criminals. It's a really negative image that's depicted of that society. Also, the way the author arrives at the airport and drives to the Bronx and almost immediately becomes a confidante of prostitutes just isn't credible. He has all the acculturated language too: speaking about housing projects, hookers and switchblades on his first day. He's a ready-made New Yorker without any learning time in his new society. I didn't find this convincing and skipped a lot of pages.    The author has a poetic turn of phrase which can be interesting and thought-provoking but is a bit trying when overdone. His description of the walker's preparation is very effective though. He really captures the walker's mental outlook which involves finding his centre and keeping himself in balance by moving various muscles. At one point he has a wire strung over deep snow, sees a coyote watching him, falls in the snow and struggles to escape, all the time imagining thawing out in the spring for the same coyote to eat him. This is very imaginative writing.    This book has won a lot of awards. But my verdict is that he tries too hard and the story doesn't hold together. I never really understood the connection between the lives of the fictional characters and the high wire walk. Read it and wonder what it takes to win big writing awards, but don't expect too much.    I will be checking out 'To reach the clouds', an intimate account of Petit's 1974 walk, cited in an author note here. There's an interesting story in this somewhere.
030726999X|5.0|Just like the second book (The Girl Who Played With Fire) in the series, this one hits the ground running.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed all three books (the first one, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, was a bit of a slog the first 1/3 or so)<br /><br />I could probably find something to criticize, like some important characters being shoved into the background and never being heard from again, or a \\"too easy\\" dispensing of some dangerous characters who had great potential for mayhem, but who cares?  No surprise endings (good guys win, bad guys lose), but it is done very neatly.  Our heroine remains an unusual character and displays the same resourcefulness as in the first two books.  She gets one or two sharp corners rounded, but only a little bit.<br /><br />A very enjoyable story and a good read.
0439023521|5.0|It's true what they say - once you start reading it prepare to be in for a non-stop ride. Much like ABC's \\"Lost\\", you'll reach the end of the episode with a cliffhanger that you just have to go to the next chapter to find out what happens next. I think there were only 3 chapter endings where I could close the book and pick it up the next day.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone. Keep in mind the \\"Hunger Games\\" movie comes out in 2012!<br /><br />&lt;...>
B002SAS26E|5.0|I stumbled upon this game in April (after seeing a review on dicehateme.com) and was amazed by its simplicity, it's strategic weight, and its overall quality of components.  A beautiful game (artistically, visually and design) that is somewhat light and quick to play, yet great fun.  About the time you think you have a winning strategy, it no longer seems to work. Once you have the rules down (after a game or two), it flows very well and you can play in about 20-30 minutes (the game is played in \\"rounds\\" in a best-of-three format, so essentially, each round takes about 10 minutes).    The \\"camel\\" gameplay mechanic adds an unbelievable challenge and makes you consider and reconsider each time you have the option to add them to your herd.  At the end of the game, whoever has the most camels earns 5 bonus points...you will be surprised how much this comes into play in determining the winner.    I wish I could do the artwork and quality of the game pieces justice, but I can't...just suffice it to say that you will be hard pressed to find a game with higher quality parts and visually appealing art.  Also, it comes in a small compact box making it very portable.  Great things come in small packages.  For anyone looking for a fantastic two-player game, definitely check this one out.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|As many times as I've read Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings, I've only read A Storm of Swords twice. After returning to it for the first time in about eight years, I'm startled by how the events of the book are remarkably fresh in my mind. A Storm of Swords serves as the end of the first act of A Song of Ice and Fire, as the War of the Five Kings comes to a climax. So much of importance happens in the book, it's hard to keep track of it all.  Characters are shuffled off the board in startling ways, and huge surprises are in store for two of our lead POV's. As much as book one belonged to Ned and book two belonged to Tyrion, book three is arguably shared by Dany and Jon.<br /><br />Delivering a great number of twists and payoffs on elements spun out of the first two books, A Storm of Swords is arguably the most satisfying volume in the series. The ending chapters are breathless page turners, as principle characters are brought again and again to the edge of peril. As angry as many fans of the HBO show were regarding Ned's scenes on the steps of the Sept of Baelor in A Game of Thrones, there are moments in this book even more shocking and horrendous -- I can't wait to see how the television audience reacts to them.<br /><br />In the end, the only disappointment I have in A Storm of Swords is that it was originally setting up a five year gap between major story movements in the series. I know what a stumble it was when Martin entered a decade-long culdesac struggling to finish A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons and fill in that gap within the story. Filling that gap may be important, but I fear it will be many years yet before the story promise offered by A Storm of Swords is fulfilled.  New readers should understand that Swords is the climax of an act and that the great twists and turns of the book may not return to the series until the pieces are properly arranged on the board once more.
0060989157|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book!!!!  I think it is well done, well written, and provides a fair perspective from everyone in the band since each band member is telling his story.  It enabled us to not just peek into the lives of a most debauched rock band, but to actually feel like we were living it with the band members.  It's told that well.  Just as with \\"Slash,\\" \\"Heroin Diaries,\\" \\"Walk This Way,\\" \\"Does the Noise in My Head Bother You,\\" and Steven Adler's \\"My Appetite for Destruction,\\" this book doesn't disappoint in smutty details about all the band members' drug use, sex lives, and of course, their band and how they composed the songs and put them all together to eventually become one of the biggest, best rock bands ever.      The sordid details of the drug use and sexual escapades just amaze me.  The stories these guys have to tell---just like with GN'R---make me seriously question how they're all still here today!  I mean, Tommy Lee and Nikki were injecting heroin and drinking godawful amts of alcohol; Mick was an alcoholic du jour; and Vince was both a drug addict and alcoholic, but his drug of choice was coke.  They all had unprotected sex, and since the 80's was when AIDS really started coming to light, you'd think these guys would have been more concerned.  Again, the fact that they're all still here, no one has AIDS, and all are relatively healthy, is just pure luck, and nothing short of a miracle.  Blows my mind!!!      The book also details how the songs were written and how they got their material.  The creative talent of these guys is astounding, and to think they almost threw everything away due to drugs and alcohol is sad.  But it made me appreciate them and their music that much more, and honestly, brought a new perspective to their music.  Despite all the drugs, these guys were always able to perform and do what they needed to do to bring it on for the fans.     This book, though it's easy to get lost in the sordid details of the drugs, booze, sex, and other escapades they all engaged in, is a testament to how devoted Motley Crue was (and still is) and the fact they persevered against all odds.  The end of the book will definitely give you something to cheer about.  I also found it touching that toward the end, when the guys are getting sober or are sober, and they become involved in serious relationships and have kids, to be touching.  You see a sweet, innocent side to these guys (especially Nikki and Tommy) that you don't necessarily see prior to marriage and kids.  It's so endearing to see these rough and tumble guys pose for photos with their significant others and/or kids, and see the gleam in their eyes, the pride in their heart, and the innocence of having rediscovered themselves through their kids--it really is touching.  The photo toward the end where Nikki is shown with all his kids and Donna D'Errico lying on some grass----it's just so pure and innocent and I just felt like these guys are GOOD guys now, and I found myself rooting for them and hoping they would all stay on the straight and narrow and be good dads and respect themselves.  I think they've  accomplished that!  Awesome, awesome book.  It's worth every penny!!
B001V5ADS2|5.0|Emotionally and socially accurate.  What happens matches reality.  But with a black-humor twist.  First season had more optimism and action than second season.  Picture's not quite so rosy -- but the show is just as addictive as the meth they cook.  Slamming boring suburban life against high-octane drug dealer adventures, and watching the characters mature, their personalities grow, is awe inspiring in its brilliance and highly entertaining.  Throw in loser side-kick with street smarts against socially challenged brilliant scientist, and you get someone like me spending this much time writing a review because it's so good I want to share.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|I purchased this case to protect my Flip mino HD camera on an upcoming vacation. As I haven't yet gone on the trip I can't comment on how well it did the job but I can say that the build quality is great, the padding is adequate, and the size is great for versatile use.    The padding is a little less, well, padded than I had imagined judging by the picture but its still enough to keep semi-fragile things safe. The bag itself is a bit big for a mino HD (a small camera to begin with) but that's no problem. That just means I can use it for all kinds of other things, like my wife's Sony cyber shot or whatever else might require the protection of a small padded bag. I might even break out the sewing machine and shorten the length up a little bit if need be.    Great little bag, great price and the addition of a mini-carabiner on the back is nifty for clipping onto your belt or a backpack. No complaints here!

Great story lines, cast meshes together very well.  All members of the cast are interesting to follow.  I love this series and hope it lasts for a long time.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|\\"In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight, let all who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's light!\\"  After destroying an expensive jet, pilot Hal Jordan (Reynolds) becomes chosen to wear the ring of the Green Lanterns.  Thinking the choice was a mistake he wonders what to do with his new powers.  Being a big Ryan Reynolds fan I was actually looking forward to this movie.  I did enjoy it, but I think with the overload of comic book movies coming out lately this is just another movie that isn't as good as the last one.  I have never been a big comic book fan and this one just seemed like a cross between Spiderman and Superman.  I think that my biggest problem with the movie is that there was not as much action as I was expecting. While the humor of Reynolds is used effectively, thier is also not enough of that either.  This may sound like I'm bashing it, but I'm really not. I did really enjoy this one, but after \\"Thor\\" this one wasn't as good.  While the effects were very good, and the acting was actually very, very good too (hard not to be with the cast) it just felt like there was something missing. Don't listen to all the bad reviews on this one, it was entertaining and fun, just a few steps away from being great.  Overall, I liked it, but it felt like it could have been better. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again - I think I would<br /><br />*Also try - Green Hornet & Fantastic Four 1 & 2
B002OG5GT8|5.0|I have been looking every where to get the full power of my headphones, and my iphone 4 couldn't do it alone. The headphones I use are Sony XB700 that sounds GREAT even without the amp. I am a bass lover and i was disappointed in the low quality in the iphone 4 and i didn't want to purchase a separate mp3 device to that job. So I bought the Fiio E5 and couldn't happier. I listen to hip hop and I LOVE it. It sounds better than my itouch 2g <-- Sounds Great.. Thank you!!!!
B004EC5IUW|4.0|I bought this and felt I needed to give my Amazon rant about it to provide some thoughts to the public - particularly those who know the original (or who are deciding between buying this or the original!).    After being an Eva fan since the release of the original series, I used to watch (and re-watch) every episode intently, fascinated by the multilayered plot, themes and amazing sound and visuals. What we have here with Rebuild 1.11 and 2.22 are a highly desireable and well received remake of the original series that, instead of simply retouching the original, attempts to 'retell' the story in a manner more suitable for a modern audience. There are new scenes, touch ups to original scenes, a new character, a fleshed out story with some slight alterations and 'new' angels. Anno and the Eva team have done this all to create a movie length feature which can summarise 8 or 9-odd episodes worth of material from the original series. While rebuild 1.11 stays quite true to the original, 2.22 beats its own drum. The story here was designed not only to give a greater background to the bigger picture but also sets up the story toward what will be a more generic type of ending we can expect from 3.33 (ie. no unanswered questions). There is less mystery and intrigue, character commentary provides more understanding to what is going on, and much of the soul searching, depth of emotion of the original has, obviously been sacrificed to cater for a much shorter feature time. I was surprised however to see completed redesigns of certain angels, which was fresh.    I have given it 4 stars because of its freshness, storytelling and attention to detail overall. Eva has never lost its appeal after all these years and brings an original and powerful story to the anime public. The amazing mecha designs, battle scenes and plot keep you interested. Where I do feel this remake loses out in comparison to the original is in the soundtrack. I noted numerous changes to the soundtrack and the power of the original score doesn't appear to be here. While new viewers won't take notice of this, I felt a noticeable lack, particularly where the decisive battle and angel attack scores were missing - they added so much to the original but instead we are left with a silent tension in parts of the story were they would have worked to great affect. This unfortunately appears to affect both 1.11 and 2.22 and seems, to me at least, to be a strange direction choice. Happily though, unlike the DVD version of the 1.01 rebuild, the voices of Ikari and Misato (in English) have been faithfully reused and the English voices sound as they originally did.    Another change is character development, new characters and new angels. This is, of course, quite major. I have an opposing view on this. On the one hand, it certainly adds to the story, and fleshes it out more. Particular characters become more transparent, they can be better understood. On the other hand,certain other characters, such as the new Mari, parlay between an important set piece yet having no true impact to the story whatsoever. She is very much a 2D character that seems to have been thrown in to counter the undecisive, fragile persona of Shinji. While it's exciting to have a new character, I couldn't help but feeling Mari's addition was incohesive and slightly odd. She is a lively character, yet lifeless, without purpose and her movements appear to go unnoticed by NERV or SEELE. However, I can fully appreciate her addition, soley because she provides a counterpoint by which we can better weigh the character degredation of Asuka, perhaps in 3.33.    Lastly, I must say that the mystery and intrigue of the original series has been slightly compromised in the rebuilds. This may of course be to accommodate the feature length, but part of what made the original so great was the fact you could not understand many things until it was all over - rather than being able to understand it while it happens in the rebuilds.This just comes down to individual taste. While the original stays elusive, complex and dark - a mirror image of Shinji - the rebuilds are instead, straightforward, progressive, and bold.    Overall, I cannot do without the rebuilds in my collection - they are another great success for Anno. 2.22 had me glued to the tv, amazed at the changes and listening closely to pick up things I now understand better than what I did when watching the original. I love the crystal quality of the animation and the consistent pace of the story, as well as the fresh wonderful character development. But, I can't sell my old collection, ever. It has the blunt and raw power in its thematics, depth, and musical score, not to mention an intrigue the rebuilds will never match. I do think it is worth spending money to buy the rebuilds even if you own the original, just to enjoy Evangelion all over again - just be aware it lacks some of the haunting intrigue and darkness of the original.
B00116W3JI|3.0|According to Milton Nascimento, he demanded a new remaster of these seminal works after he has listened to the remasters of Elis Regina's \\"Elis & Tom\\" and \\"Falso Brilhante\\". He had good reasons to do this; after all, these two remasters do really sound great; they allow us to take a peek into the recording studio and the people involved in these historical recordings; and finally, they are among the only three titles which have been launched in DVD-A format in Brazil (the other one being \\"Muito Mais Caetano\\", a compilation of Caetano Veloso tracks from his Universal catalogue). Differently from Elis' albums, however, the effort has not paid.<br /><br />Except for some details, \\"Clube 1\\" sounds as much the same as the 1995 Abbey Road Remastering edition. Perhaps one can listen better to some instruments in some tracks, maybe the bass is more prominent, but after all there was no way to do much with these tracks. According to the booklet, there was no master tape for Clube 1 sessions - just the 2-channel stereo masters. This is probably true, since EMI Odeon Brasil has not adopted 8-track recording until 1973, and the 3-channel masters (if they ever existed) must have been probably erased. Also, for some reason that I can't understand, there is no banding between the tracks; we can't \\"breath\\" between one track and another, and thus the production of the disc sounds rushed, as if the mastering engineer hated the music he was working with and wanted to get rid of it as fast as possible.<br /><br />On the other hand, I just can't understand why they bothered to remix \\"Clube 2\\" on its entirety. Again, there is no banding between the tracks, and again the production as whole feels rushed; on the other hand, most tracks start 1/10th of a second later than they should; as a result, you will never be able to listen to a particular song from its absolute beginning. And at least in one case, tracks have been actually cropped; compare \\"Credo\\" from the 1995 edition which is 3:05 long to the version of this edition, where it is just 2:56 long. As if the silence was not as important as the sound is...<br /><br />Other thing that bothered me: the album seems to have been remixed to emphasize the singers more than the instruments. This does not work all the time, and it fails particularly on \\"Canoa Canoa\\" where the birds have been strongly suppressed - perhaps it's the case since 30 years later we don't have birds anymore? Anyway, this is a travesty in the case of the albuns of Milton, where the instruments are as important as the voices. Also, in some cases the characteristic stereo sound fields of the 70's have been destroyed. The stereophonic interplay of the guitars on \\"Ruas da Cidade\\" is not that sharp anymore;  the powerful stereo reverberations of Milton's voice in \\"E Da&iacute;?\\" have been suppressed; the lonely piano in the right channel in the ending of \\"Toshiro\\" has just disappeared (plays in both channels now); the left-to-right \\"floating bass\\" in the ending of \\"Reis e Rainhas do Maracatu\\" just does not exist anymore. And these are just the more prominent examples that immediately caught my attention.<br /><br />Are there improvements on this new remix? Yes, they do exist, here and there. \\"O Que Foi Feito Dever&aacute;/De Vera\\" has been completely reworked and I feel it has been treated with special care, as it's really better in this new version. The remix was very well-thought, and here we distinguish elements that didn't appear in the original editions, either the original vinyl or the 1995 edition. Boca Livre's backing vocals in \\"Misterios\\" have been emphasized in this release, and in the case this also adds to the song and also counts as a tribute to them, as this song was also a cornerstone of their own repertory. \\"Testamento\\" has got some powerful drums which make us feel being in the middle of the brazilian jungle and recall us of the indian chants of native brazilians; and finally, \\"Que Bom, Amigo\\" has the instruments appearing in more detail and in a much more ordenated matter than they appear in the original version. But at the end of the day, 4 out of 23 is not a good ratio for a remixed album that pretended to sound as great as the new Elis Regina releases.<br /><br />To wrap it up: look for the 1995 ARM releases of these albums, since you will not lose much in Clube da Esquina 1 and you will listen to Clube da Esquina 2 as it was originally conceived in 1978.nated matter than they appear in the original version.

B002E01LLG|3.0|The movie is good, entertaining to watch on a sunday mornining.<br />Nothing particularly special(acting, direction, edition, photography, story), but it has very good fight scenes.<br /><br />The quality of the image on this BluRay is very good but the SoundMix is awful.<br />I reviewed a BD named \\"Fair Game\\" (Doug Liman, Sean Penn and Naomi Watts) with the very same problem:<br />All the sound effects are too loud and the dialoge is too low; it's very hard to hear what people say in the movie.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a movie I had always intentioned to have in my movie collection and never got around to it.  So when I seen it on Amazon, I thought wow great! now I can finally buy it at a very low price.  So I did.  I am very satisfied with my purchase as it arrived in brand new condition in original packaging.  The shipping envelope it came in was very protective as my shipment arrived in pristine condition.  Amazon and this seller won a forever customer for this transaction.
0446563048|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's an easy read because Tony writes like he speaks. It feels like a conversation with the man. And it's funny, too. I found myself bursting out laughing while reading it a quite a few times. What I think is the most important message of this book, aside from the fact that he has made two wildly successful companies, despite the fact that it's funny, is that Tony believes that business can be a win-win.<br /><br />Our economy is in a state of turmoil because businessmen being greedy decided to sacrifice the well-being of our country for quick millions. They won't come out ahead if the economy keeps tanking and prices go up. It won't be pretty if a complete economic collapse makes their millions worthless. Delivering Happiness shows us, with living proof, that companies can work together for their mutual benefit. Competition doesn't have to be cut-throat. We don't have to squeeze our profits from our vendors. Most importantly, we don't have to treat people like nameless assets.<br /><br />Zappos' call center philosophy is what most impressed me. No call times, no sales goals, no scripts. It's a dream come true. Tony and Fred trust people to be intelligent and want to do their job and they understand that you are more likely to respond to a positive experience than sales pressure.<br /><br />I only hope that Zappos philosophy is catchy!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau was an amazing film. Damon and Blunt had great chemistry which, I believe, made the movie more interesting. A few sites are sying this is a science fiction movie when really it is more of a romantic-thriller. Personally, I say one of the best movies 2011 has to offer. I saw this movie in theaters when it came out in March with some friends and my girlfriend and it really makes you think afterwards. At the end the movie got a standing ovation from the audience. I reccomend this movie very highly.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|In a world filled with so much garbage music, Symphony X is one of the few bands out there putting out great, original metal. I got a copy of this album early and all I can say is I'm completely blown away. I have been listening to this album for a week straight now and each time I listen, I like it more and more. The level of production and musicianship are at a peak here and I would even go so far as to say this is Symphony X's best album. In my opinion, Symphony X surpassed Dream Theater a few albums ago as the best progressive metal band out there and this release further proves that statement.      This album just plain kicks from beginning to end. What I love most about Symphony X is not only the riffs and vocal melodies, but the shifting of tempo and feel throughout a song. There are moments of beauty with the piano and acoustic/clean guitars, almost an oasis of sorts, wedged between hard-hitting metal riffs. There is just so much to love here, this album definitely qualifies as EPIC. The guitar playing is at the highest level and drumming is seriously some of the best I've heard on a metal record. Just amazing.     This is an album that should be bought by any metal lover, no matter if you like progressive metal or not. Everyone who gets that feeling through their veins when they hear good metal should RUN to get this album.     Highlights include:    The End of Innocence  Heretic  When all Is Lost (My favorite)  Children of a Faceless God
B003ZSH606|5.0|Every fan of Jamiroquai should have this CD in their collection.  The album \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" dips into some of their older jazzy styles with the horns while still having an evolving sound as a band.  The genre of this CD would be a little difficult to categorize but I may go with 'electro-jazz' over all, while other tracks are more of their older acid jazz sound.  Jamiroquai does not disappoint.
0439023521|5.0|There hasn't been a book series like this in a long time! From the opening pages, I was captured by the characters and the story. I've always wanted to be a writer and am amazed when someone like Collins can create such an imaginative and impressive world. I can't WAIT for the movie now!!
1904633153|4.0|Book is in great condition and received it quickly. The only CON is the book was really small. If the description said it was a gift book size, then it is my fault for missing it in the description.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The show itself looks and sounds great, very interesting and thought-provoking. It feels much more real than most movies or television shows about similar experiences. What would the world be like if one day most of the world was undead? The human drama is definitely the main point of the show, just set-up with a zombie backdrop.<br /><br />That said, the extras leave a lot to be desired. First, it seems like after every menu selection there's a splash screen that states \\"Walking Dead Season 2 coming this fall\\". It gets old quickly, and will be completely useless once season 2 starts.<br /><br />Second, the featurettes are split into two different screen sections, and I'm not sure why because they seem to be pretty similar to each other. Also, in my world, \\"extra footage\\" means cut scenes, but in this set it means \\"behind the scenes\\" features.<br /><br />So, terrific show, but the extras aren't presented logically, and the splash screens both waste time and are maddening because they'll be obsolete soon. If ever there was a time to wait for a series to end and hope for an entire series collection, now would be it. But watch the show, definitely. ^_^
B003UESJIS|5.0|Tom is a geologist, at the start of the film, checking drill core to ensure strong foundations for coming construction. Gerry is a medical counselor, gently attempting to help her clients tend to their lives. Both are gardeners who know that you can have almost anything you want, provided you plant the seeds and take the time to tend and direct their growth. Their reward is shared time together and a bountiful harvest freely shared with others.     Mary, a middle-aged secretary at Gerry's office, knows none of this.   She repeatedly comments on Tom and Gerry's \\"luck\\" but is clueless about its source.  She has no interest in others beyond finding the perfect man who will love her and even cook for her. She doesn't cook for herself or others (replacing food with alcohol)and besides, it's so much easier to go home to Tom and Gerry's where she is cared for. She even imagines a romantic relationship with their son, half her age, who she used to babysit, and is shattered (and unspeakably rude) when he brings his girlfriend home to meet the parents.     She buys a wreck of a car imagining that it will make her even more free from responsibility (in this case, train schedules) but has no clue how to care for it or even what its needs might be. At a garden party, where she imagines her mechanical difficulties to be the main topic of interest, she completely fails to notice a co-worker's new baby.     Yes, Mary is unlucky, much like the profoundly depressed insomniac woman at the very beginning of the movie -- who has only two brief appearances. So why is SHE there? Because in another year or two or three, that will be Mary. She is the harvest.     There are no entertaining shoot outs or car chases here, and the only monsters are real ones. This is a quiet meditation on real life, the foundations and the seeds and patterns of growing and dying that we put in place through our own choices and desires and their consequences. Sadly and beautifully and brilliantly done.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I still remember reading the book while In Junior High School and enjoyed it then. I watch Jane Eyre whenever I get the opportunity. It appears that most of what was read in the book was incorporated into the movie.
0670022411|5.0|With the fantasy of Twilight and Charlaine Harris as it combines other worldly creatures, this book stays greatly grounded in a way that makes everything read more like realistic fiction. The characters are so well developed you find yourself invested in them, loving them, imagining them in real life.  The history lessons are intriguing.  I couldn't put the book down as the tension builds to the big standoff; however, I was really frustrated that the book ultimately just sets up a sequel.  I wanted closure of the initial conflict and for the main couple, but alas, I have to wait for the next one. read and you will find yourself rooting for the protagonists and screaming b/c you have to wait for more.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Communique is the \\"must have\\" album for anyone who has merely heard the radio cuts by Dire Straits. During the years that this band ruled the airwaves they were pigeonholed into a few hits but their other stuff was bigger, more dynamically powerful, darker sometimes. Knopfler's guitar always was amazing and never better than on Communique.

1594744769|5.0|I had no idea what to expect going into this book. Sure, I saw the creepy pics when asked to review it and thought, yup, going to be creepy. But, I really didn't expect such an awesome story! I started reading late on a stormy night. Really clich&eacute;, I know, but it helped set the mood.<br /><br />Jacob was an interesting character. I really liked him because he wasn't your typical sixteen-year-old dude. He has a unique personality. Although at times, I did forget he was sixteen. Sometimes he seemed too mature. I don't think this hurt his character, there are lots of mature teens out there, and it's fresh to see them in YA. The bond he shares with his grandfather was so heart-warming. Also, one thing I liked was the story centered on the holocaust, showing that even though WW2 is over, the damage inflicted during that time can follow and even linger in generations later. Very brilliant.<br /><br />The beginning or the story had me looking through my blinds, extremely eerie feeling, but as the story progressed, the plot balanced out and I found myself enjoying the fantasy of it all. The pictures were a great touch. I loved being able to visualize the description on one page, then flip and really study the image. I felt pulled into the world and connected to the characters. Each character was just that. A character. Their stories and gifts made the tale, and added to the odd and quirky feel of the novel. Love it!<br /><br />Emma was by far my favorite other than Jacob. She has such spunk and fire. Literally fire. I really liked seeing their relationship develop through Jacob's POV. It was sweet and romantic in a new way. Although the ending leaves readers on a major cliffhanger, I think it's written in a way that leaves you satisfied. Jacob came full circle, and now he's embarking on new adventures and his life will never be the same. This was a fantastic read!
0142004413|5.0|I laughed so hard reading this book on the bus that people started looking at me in a weird way.     G. Durrell is not only a great storyteller, he's a master of comedy.

B0035F0MTG|5.0|On Youtube, I watched Yuja Wang two days ago for the first time.

They are bad taste guys and this seems to be irremediable.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is the best movie that most people haven't seen.  It has an interesting screenplay, engaging cast, exotic locations, and sumptuous costumes.  I didn't hear about this visual feast until years after its initial release, and it's hard  to believe it wasn't nominated for awards in art direction, cinematography, and costume design.  People who like [[ASIN:B000WSLAUO Pan's Labyrinth]], and [[ASIN:B0001GOH6Q Big Fish]], and who have a soft spot for [[ASIN:B00005LOKQ The Princess Bride]] will probably love this movie.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|I have seen hundreds of movies, and this is one of the very best. Not just because it's science fiction, and impressively so, but also because it's thought provoking, existential, religious, radical, uplifting, and surprising, all the while remaining an engrossing adventure.<br /><br />Jodie Foster portrays a captivating heroine. Matthew McConaughey provides friendly balance. The director is the notable Robert Zemeckis. The book that the movie does justice to was written by Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends.<br /><br />An outstanding production.

B004TACMZ8|4.0|I live in an attached home with metal as well as wood wall studs and plumbing that runs through the attic and down the walls.  Just about the perfect test bed for wall scanners.<br /><br />The way this scanner works is a bit unintuitive.  The user selects one of three modes; wood, metal or live electrical.  When you select wood, the Bosch actually scans for all three.  Selecting metal excludes wood, so you're scanning for metal and live electrical wire.  Selecting live electrical limits the scanner to only that.  Indicators in the display show what the scanner is reacting to; wood, metal or live electric.<br /><br />The Bosch GMS120 did well scanning for wood.  Since I live in an attached home, my neighbors and I are separated by a cement block fire wall.  My dry wall is attached to that using thin furring bar.  The Bosch reliably found the furring bar even against that dense slab of concrete.<br /><br />When scanning metal, the Bosch attempts to determine if the metal is magnetic or not.  That's useful to me, for instance, so I can tell if I'm detecting a steel wall stud or a copper water pipe.  The Bosch gets it right most of the time, but not always.  Sometimes magnetic metals are identified as non-magnetic.  Still, the Bosch did a good job of finding metal studs.  On interior walls, I could even identify studs supporting the wall I was scanning and studs supporting the other side of the wall.  I could tell the difference by the signal strength displayed by the Bosch.<br /><br />This wall scanner had the hardest time detecting live electrical wire.  All the wiring in my home is simple 3 conductor plastic insulated wire with no shielding.  Still, the Bosch could not detect most of it even when I made sure electricity was flowing.  My guess is that the Bosch detected wiring best when it was lying against the underside of the drywall being scanned.<br /><br />The Bosch is a useful tool and a good addition to your toolbox.  Just remember it's a tool to help you find things in your walls, not the final word.  So don't drill into your wall directly above a light switch just because your scanner didn't find electricity there!  Use common sense, and you and the Bosch should get along fine..

B004YJZBCK|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this release & it didn't let me down at all, it actually blew me away. IMO the first two Bad Co. albums are the best & now Audio Fidelity has issued Straight Shooter to go along with the self titled debut & it really rocks!! People either love or hate Steve Hoffman but to my ears he has done a wonderful mastering job on Straight Shooter. Simon Kirke's drums pack a punch, they are very sharp, & Mick Ralph sounds fantastic, not to mention the ageless Paul Rodgers. My only complaint is that the album is short & I didn't want it to end (LOL) so I played it twice through just to appreciate the solid musicianship sounding so good. I paid about $22 including shipping & it is about the best sounding cd for the buck that I own, out of about 4000 including DVD-A, SACD,MOFI,SHM etc. etc. If you are a fan of Bad Co., or just a fan of rock & roll, this AF release is a must have!!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|When you hear about World War ll and the Holocaust, you mostly think of Hitler and the Germans attacking the Jews, but Sarah's Key is told from a little French girl's experiance with the war. Sarah had been through things that most of us don't feel like thinking about. Her undying love for her little brother is what kept him away from concentration camps and other horrible things, but he still came to a sad end. Sarah's Key has some sad parts, but it is really a book about surviving and having courage, even if you are the only one.

B0034G4P80|2.0|This movie was a major disappointment, but I suppose that's not saying much given that I'm a long-time comic book fan, and thus one of the people who is virtually guaranteed to be underwhelmed by movies featuring Marvel characters. As has already been said, the script was totally predictable, the acting often painful to watch, and many aspects of the movie completely senseless.  The actor chosen to play \\"Thor\\" certainly had the look, but he certainly didn't have the script needed to determine whether or not he has the acting chops to do the role justice.  As for Natalie Portman, I would like to see her take a few years off, as I'm tired of seeing her in so many movies lately.  I read where someone said that they \\"didn't expect a masterpiece\\" where this movie was concerned... It's very telling that someone would pay today's prices to see a movie they expected to be mediocre at best, and is a perfect example of what's wrong with our society overall. That's another story though...
B004WPYNY8|3.0|Iconoclast is a pretty much paint by numbers remake of Paradise Lost. Not that theres anything wrong with that.I was just expecting a little more after almost 4 years. There arent as many time changes and is more straight ahead. The lyrics also border on cringe worthy at times.  The chanting, the eerie choruses, the keyboard solos(or is it a guitar solo) weve all heard before. It all adds up to unfortunately a pretty underwhelming CD. It does pick up about 6 songs in however. This CD doesnt suck by any stretch its just well worn territory that was pretty much perfected last time around.
B00000G6PJ|5.0|I originally bought the US Virgin release of  NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS... back when it was first released in the USA. Now, this is definately one of the greatest albums of all times. The production is incredible, Johnny Rotten just smashes you to bits with his words. John lydon is a very intellectual person, and even though this was Punk Rock, which had a stigmatism attached as being a mindless barrage of useless noise, it is far the contrary. Steve Jones is an excellent guitarist, being that when they first started, they couldn't play a note, yet Steve jones is extremely tight as both a rhythm guitarist, as well as a lead guitarist, Glen Matlock did an excellent job on bass, although, from what i hear, by the time the album was released, Glen Matlock was no longer with the band, and since Sid was barely learning to play bass guitar, that Steve jones actually played the bass parts. I don't know about every song on the album, but this was the setup on alot, if not all of the songs. I bought the UK version just as a collectors item both on vinyl, and on CD. This record was released in several different countries, under different labels. I have just about every release of this album both on vinyl as well as CD. It takes a really great album to go out and spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for that super rare release of an album. This album is one that every musician should own, regardless of your music background, etc. I listen to all sorts of music, allthough I must admit that I had every Sex Pistols album i could get, and grew up when punk rock was at it's absolute highlight. I remember listening to bands such as Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath, The Ramones, and of course the Sex Pistols in grammar school! I started out playing punk rock on the guitar until I was good enough to play progressive metal,classical, jazz, etc. I don't know what i would have done without that Sex Pistols influence to love myself for who I was, and to be free in mind, body, and spirit., and spirit.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Downloaded this, excited to use it. My antivirus flagged it and advised me to delete it ASAP. Out of EVERY app i have ever downloaded, and that's at least 50, this is the first time that has ever happened.  No thanks, not worth the risk!
0316067598|4.0|The political diatribes tended to overwhelm what could have been a superbly riveting and inspiring story. Great pathos comes from describing facts and letting the reader interpret them for him- or herself. I still enjoyed the book immensely. But, I regret the distractions. Maybe the book can be edited and an apolitical version can be published.

B00475AYJQ|2.0|Like so many others I am held hostage by an excellent opener in a new popular series. My review is crap because I will definately buy, and read, the future installments.    If you have the discipline, unlike me, read a summary of events and skip this book. Read other reviews if you need 1000 words on why this book was such a dissapointment.  This was a rushed, garbage sequel.  You will find yourself mindlessly skimming the overly explained, mashed up plotline.  Let's not forget the &#34;erotic&#34;descriptions of Kvothe's many sex scenes. Pure, unfiltered crap.  There's a reason why Katniss didn't have graphic sex scenes; The Hunger Games was an exciting, well told story that didn't need it to wake the reader from a semi coma.      Can't wait for the third.
B001UDYI9K|3.0|I cannot understand this release. In my opinion, Eric had one of the best voices in popular music. Listen to those vocals on 'Time' or 'silence and I'. Truly brilliant. If this was a posthumous release, I would understand. I like all the songs without exception. But the lead vocals are awful. So, so out of tune and this is something I just can't fathom. It is worst on 'Golden key', but 'any other day' wavers everywhere, making the song unlistenable. What escapes me, is why he didn't notice and re-record the vocals.   In most of the tracks, they are much like a recording, with a demo vocal thrown on top at the last minute. This is blatant in 'rumour goin round'. Other tracks are poor. 'I can see round corners' is just boring and goes nowhere. 'Steal your heart away' is fine as a simplistic pop song, but the lead vocal is a joke. You need a reverb drenched 80's style voice here. Eric sounds weak and like an old man karaoking the track. Truly embarrassing.  The best track for me, is 'nothing can change my mind', a truly brilliant and melodic piece. But it sounds like a demo. Listen to the keyboard break that threatens to ruin the song.  If it had been released as a bunch of demos, I would have been more praiseworthy.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Hey all,    First of all, i've been gaming a lot on my ps3 and had a ps2 before, never was too fond of the dualshock controller, before ps3 gaming, i used to play a lot of halo with a friend that had an Xbox, totally fell in love with the controller.    Although i've had my ps3 for a bit over 2 years, i had never thought of buying a controller like the xbox's.    This one is just amazing, the grips feel great, the lights on the buttons make a great enhancement while playing with low light or no light at all, triggers are good, not as long and deep as the ones on the DS3, but still feels great, been playing borderlands, demons souls, red dead redemption, COD Black Ops, no dead zone at all, actually i've been getting more headshots on FPS's haha. Also made some exaustive testing on these games to see whether or not it had more or less dead zone than the DS3 controller, got to the conclusion that it is the same, at first it felt a little weird but after sync and testing again, worked awesome ! :)     Bottom line is this that this controller has worked great for me, i don't know why other reviewers dis it so bad XD

B000Y1H7VA|5.0|This item is great! With songs like \\"Tarantula\\" and \\"Doomsday Clock\\", this is a must buy. It also features 3 bonus tracks (\\"Stellar\\", \\"Death From Above\\", and \\"Ma Belle\\"), and a bonus DVD! I didn't buy it from amazon though, I found the best price possible! Best Buy.com They have it for $0.49 and then with sales tax, it's about $0.53!
B003PBB4ME|2.0|You can make better homemade handles, this handle is way too light that even the slightest movement shakes a ton, i film skating and i was gonna get one of these but today on go skate day i met a kid with one and as soon as i put it in my hand i knew it took probably ten cents to make, my five year old brother cant lift a 10 pound weight and he would be able to break this clean in half, my homemade handle is much better than this, definatly not worth 35 bucks, if you are rich and just want to look legit get it, if you care about your filming and could care less if people dont think you look legit, make your own it will preform much better, youtube has good toutorials on how to make them
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|From my understanding, this novel was born from taking old pictures from collectors, and fashioning a fantasy story around the scrapbook you made.  While this is interseting, and was a hook to get me to make the purchase, the entertaining and lyrical story born from the effort stands easily by itself. This is a good thing, because on the smaller Kindle, much of the details of the photos are lost.  There was also a handwritten letter or photo caption that required magnifying glasses to read as a result of my Kindle v2 screen.  It was the first time I actually yearned for the printed page.<br /><br />It is also worth noting that there were at least three pictures that seemed forced.  It was as if Mr. Riggs was so enamored with their visual quality that he made unnecessary references or characters in his writing to include them.  The few times that I found myself thinking that, it immediately removed me from the world the novel was creating.<br /><br />While this may sound like a criticism, it is only jarring because the world he created was so incredibly vivid. It reads as first rate fantasy tale where each of the children pop out as wholly unique entities regardless of the amount of pages allotted to them.  Those looking to fill the void that the Potter series left could do far worse than Miss Peregrine and her charges.  One thing that I will caution those who are coming from other realms, there is a certain lack of innocence that comes through here.  The narrator is 16...a realistic 16.  He uses certain language, thinks about certain things, and expresses certain sentiments that may not be as sheltered as characters such as Harry Potter.  The result from an adult perspective is enjoyable, but 5th grade and under may be inappropriate.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Move over Bruce.  Angelina is your female counterpart.  This is a good action movie.  Jolie, who is known to do a lot of her own stunts does a great job.  This blu ray version is a nice touch with its extended and director's cuts.  Without going into a detailed synopsis of the plot, suffice it to say that this is an action flick similar in some respects to Willis' \\"The Jackal.\\"  Whereas Willis played an international hit man for hire,  Jolie plays a Russian mole implanted into the CIA.  Both roles contain the usual wild and unbelievable action sequences.  But what the heck, this is an action flick, and most action flicks are not meant to mirror reality.  They are what they are, entertainment.  I found this movie to be just that, and recommend it to all of those that like to watch pure action entertainment.
0553381695|3.0|Not as fresh as the first book. Less interesting characters, more words spent describing wardrobe than personality. Within the plot itself, too much \\"deux ex machina\\". Still, two books into it, I will end up buying the next one... guess that is how series work.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I found this book extraordinary. It was so well written in a 5 year old's voice. This is a powerful book that, if read in a book club, would spark a lively discussion. It is thoroughly engrossing, suspenseful, and thought provoking. I loved every page.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I finished watching all of of these with my wife just a few weeks now, yes we watched both movies, and I miss it all ready. I'm just so thrilled she has a great version to watch over & over.
B0048FQ0HU|3.0|Very simple message throughout, think positive always and positive will come back to you.... over and over and over and over again lol I was kinda tired of constantly listening to it. I guess it helps to people who are depressed or in very bad mood. To the rest of the happy people, who are positive and optimistic by nature this book is a shelf book that you listen/read once if ever and never again :) My advice: Life is beautiful, be happy, be positive, listen to Mozart, stop watching TV, spend time with family and love your surroundings :)
B0052UZIFA|2.0|While the game works fine on my droic incredible, it crashes on startup on my new galaxy tab 10.1.  So don't get this if you're planning on using it on a tablet.
B00136NUG6|4.0|I didn't do much research into what was available in terms of Earth, Wind & Fire hits collections before buying this, since it was Amazon's daily MP3 sale one day for $3.99, but based on what little I know of the band, most of the hits casual fans are familiar with are here. \\"September\\" is the one I'm most aware of and the main reason why I bought this, but I was surprised at how many other songs I knew. If you were a kid alive in the late '70s / early '80s, you no doubt heard \\"Shining Star\\", \\"That's The Way Of The World\\", \\"Let's Groove\\", \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" and \\"After The Love Has Gone\\" playing on your parents' car radio.<br /><br />It has that feel of an older hits collection - bare bones, with no unreleased tracks or rarities, but that was enough for me, and will probably be enough for most new fans.
0061474347|4.0|Not perfect- it drags on in places but overall a really fun read.  The characters are engaging and the plot (of an unwilling young girl unwilling becoming the Abhorsen- the one charged with sending evil spirits back to the dead and protecting the land from them) is well done and not too cliche.  its not up there with my top 20 fantasy books but I really enjoyed reading it.  DONT read the Mister monday books that he wrote though- nothing like this series and not near as good.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a ghostwriter and book project consultant, I'm recommending this book to all of my clients. John Locke unveils the mystery that for too long has been hidden from most authors: how to develop a fanatically loyal fan base that will go out and market your books for you. I'll give you a hint. It isn't a trick or some kind of manipulation. But it does have everything to do with caring for and about people. If you care about reaching your world with your message, you need to read this book.  Dwight Clough  DwightClough.com
B000000IRK|5.0|When I was a kid, I used to go my local library to borrow this album at least once a month! I would sit by the speakers and just marvel at the guitar and drums on this album. I can truly say that I have memorized pretty much every note and vocal nuance on this whole record. Then MFSL gave this classic album the \\"gold\\" treatment (remastering and pressing it onto a gold disc), this disc absolutely cooks! I am not sure how they do the mastering at the MFSL labs, but pretty much anything they do just seems to jump out of the speakers at you and sounds a bit brighter.     On this pressing they also tossed in an alternate version of \\"Eyesight To the Blind\\" which I had never heard before! Instead of the high pitched voice we all know, Roger instead sings in a lower register, interesting. This is the ONLY place you can get this version.     This being a pretty early title for MSFL, a good amount were made so you shouldn't have to spend over $25 to grab a good used copy (or if you have deeper pockets, then grab a brand new one). Either way I don't think you'll be disappointed with the sound or the packaging.
0545091020|3.0|I read the print version and loved it and recently checked out the audio version from my library to listen to while working out or driving. The narrator sounds way too old to be narrating a 16 year old girl. It's almost distracting.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|This feels much like a \\"B\\" movie on a \\"A\\" movie budget.  It's a tried and true supernatural tale with lots of gore, swearing and driving and the action is pretty good as well.  Amber Heard's spunky character is fun to watch as she gets into fist fight after fist fight with men but her rationale for continuing with the main character is hit or miss at best.  But, to be fair, you can't take this movie too seriously and enjoy it at the same time so you have to just roll with it.  Old automobile aficionados will appreciate some of the rides in this picture.  The blonde in the motel with Cage during the gunfight was cleverly hilarious and the Devil's Accountant was arguably the most colorful character.  WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; ACTION: B to B plus; HUMOR: B; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B004T0XYM8|4.0|I have to admit, this is a beautiful looking film, and Blu Ray helps capture the quality. this is leaps and bounds above my old VHS copy of the film! I have it on DVD as well, a two disc set with plenty of special features. I am not sure, but it looks like this has many of those same featureets. I have yet to see if the commontary is the same for both the DVD and Blu Ray. but enough about that, I got the movie because of how it looks, not the extras. I have no regrets buying it. B+
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I just downloaded Johns Book yesterday night and rushed through it.  Cause I did not know John Locke till now, I stopped in the middle of this how to book and downloaded \\"Saving Rachel\\", just to learn, what he is talking about.   Now I had two problems. Time was running away and I wanted to finish both books ;-).    I managed to stop reading about Donovan Creed and Rachel and continued reading this how to book.  I really enjoyed it. I am quite familiar with the whole social media stuff, I write a blog myself (jobundjoy.de) since 2005 and publishes two books (non fiction).   I could not stop reading, till I reached the end.    Really the best marketing advice about book marketing I ever read. I wish this had been available, when my first books were published. But for the next ones, I really take his advice.    John, thank you very much!
B004XGWPXC|5.0|I loved this book and thought the author was so clever the way he wrote it--revisiting his characters on the same day each year.  I have to admit, I was shocked by the ending (won't give it away, but there were tears involved).  I will never make the mistake of finishing a book at bedtime... the ending kept me up all night!
B0012GMW7A|5.0|I'm a long-time fan. His poetry and fiction as well as his songs. So unique, so graceful, so true; I've listen to his golden voice and great ideas for 30 years. He's amazing. This album's fine too, of course.
0345529057|5.0|First, I never heard about the book / series till it started playing on HBO  Second, as soon as the season finale got over, I was on Amazon trying to order the next book  Third, I like to get value for money so of course wanted to order the combo pack.... saw lots of negative reviews about missing pages n this n that n missing TOC etc....  Forth, believed in the positive reviews and still wend ahead with ordering the Combo Pack Paper edition...    Finally, got the books, all of them are great, good paper, nothing is missing, perfect perfect perfect... so want to make sure that any of you contemplating... go for it, this is one is sure not to disappoint you.
B003UESJH4|4.0|The King's Speech is one of those movies where everyone does their job impeccably. This includes the director who created a remarkably accurate period piece from the 30s. He manages to accurately portray the environment around the royal family. Colin Firth's Academy Award for his role as the stuttering king was a shoo in. What I liked is that Firth does not overplay the role and indulges in no histrionics. His performance is sincere and the tone is exactly right. The director also avoids the temptation to make the story too dramatic and portray it as some kind of incredible triumph over adversity (it is a movie about stuttering after all, not some story of survival in a concentration camp). At the same time he also manages to convey how acutely debilitating and painful stuttering can be for anyone whose professional career involves public speaking.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush puts on another one of his fine performances, playing Firth's speech therapist with a droll sense of humor. Rush does a great job of bringing out the personality of a simple and honest man who kept himself from getting swayed by royalty and remained respectful and professional without turning into a servile flatterer or getting cowed by the king. The movies does a wonderful job of portraying the relationship between the two men as one between equals. Helena Bonham Carter also shines as Firth's wife, a wise woman with a dry sense of humor who was supportive and yet independent-minded.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best period pieces I have seen in the last few years. By honestly portraying King's George's story as it was without any melodramatic flourishes, it gives us an accurate picture of the times and the people. Every member of the cast plays his or her part well and the product is a finely crafted film.
0062060554|5.0|This book was so riveting.  I literally could not put it down and was so resentful when I finished it because I wanted to read more.  I tought I would just read a few pages but found myself wanting to know what happened next.  I thoroughly enjoyed every page!
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|I was never that excited about Tron: Legacy, having not seen the original movie, but the visual style got me interested. Well, that and Olivia Wilde looking damn good in all the ads I'd seen. But watching Tron: Evolution was a complete chore, despite me being wide awake and not having any distractions. This movie was cold, had all the action in the first half of the movie, had one whole character with personality, and relied way too much on the incredible special effects. Just think about the Star Wars prequels, only nowhere near as bad, and that's what Tron: Legacy is. I think this movie will only appeal to hardcore fans of the original, who've been waiting so long for the sequel, or people who will like anything sci-fi because they don't know any better.    The movie starts out with Sam Flynn, son of Kevin Flynn, the original Tron's main character. Kevin built a computer program that was essentially its own world, but disappeared one day, never to be seen again. After causing a little bit of over-dramatic havoc with the company his dad ran, Sam goes into Kevin's old arcade, and stumbles upon an old computer, and enters the program. The world looks like a high-tech night club, complete with a rockin' soundtrack to go along with it, but it's not all fun. Immediately, Sam is thrown into dangerous games, where you can be 'derezzed' (the program's equivalent of death), whether you're a real person or AI. After he gets saved by the lovely Quorra, Sam meets his dad for the first time in years, where everything's revealed about the world, and how they can get out into the real world again.    If the plot summary sounds good to you, well, then by all means rent the movie. But there are too many problems that keep it from being the hit that it wanted to be. First up, the characters are dull. Aside from Kevin Flynn, I didn't care for any of these characters. Well, aside from Quorra of course, but that's just because she was so dang pretty. Sam is plain, all the bad guys areas generic as you can be and not threatening, emoting mostly with scowls, and yelling here and there, and it's hard to connect with them. Granted, there were some good father-son moments, but that was all thanks to Jeff Bridges' acting, where it always came off as sincere. I liked the touch of having Kevin use some outdated slang words from the 80s, but I couldn't help thinking that I was seeing The Dude instead of Kevin Flynn in some parts. The other huge problem is that all the action is thrown into the first half of the movie: a big chase, light cycle races, disc fights, etc. These were all really cool scenes, and not getting anything even equal to those scenes for the climax was a huge letdown. Almost as bad is the lack of humor that isn't coming out of Jeff Bridges' mouth. I wasn't expecting a comedy, but for god's sake, this movie could almost pass off as a sci-fi drama instead of a sci-fi action movie. Before and after the light cycle and disc fight scenes, I was literally falling asleep thanks to the poor pacing. As incredible as the visuals and art direction were, which is the reason I'm still thinking about this movie 2 months after watching it, I don't know if I'll ever buy it and watch it much because of how boring it was. This is one of those movies I'd have just to skip to my favorite scenes, then throw back on the shelf for x months.    As for the blu-ray itself, it's absolutely perfect. Flawless picture and audio. If there's any one movie out there to show off your new tv and sound system with, it's definitely this one. And if you have a 3D tv, go with the 3D version of the movie, because it's one of the few 3D blu-rays that really uses the technology as it was meant to be. I have zero complaints in these categories. The special features are loaded as well, but the main thing you'll want to watch is the Flynn Lives material. It covers the marketing campaign that got all the hardcore fans hyped.    Like I just mentioned, I'm still thinking about thismovie 2 months later, but it's all because of the visuals and soundtrack...and Olivia Wilde. There's nothing special about Tron: Legacy as far as the story or characters go, and it has a couple of scenes that are downright embarrassing to watch (Michael Sheen's odd dance bit comes to mind immediately). But the look of the movie is so beautiful that I have to recommend it because of that. Maybe go with The Art of Tron art book instead, and save yourself some boredom.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is a super fun game. Too bad it turns me in to an angry zombie!  I'm on a Samsung Captivate. This game has \\"lost\\" my place/ saved game three times. Since you can't play the side games until you complete adventure and you can't skip around in adventure mode you have to start at the beginning. That means the tutorial levels, and hours to get back to your place.<br /><br />Second, it freezes, crashes, and has delayed graphic if anything else is running in the background. I can't listen to podcasts while I zombie my way back through those early levels. Is your navigation app accidentally open in the background? Be prepared to pull your battery!<br /><br />An update could fix these problems, right?  Then I'd be a happy smiley sunflower!
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I abandoned my personal boycott of Woody Allen films to see \\"Midnight in Paris\\" mainly due to the dearth of quality films that come out to our theaters (the industry seems to think our sotted suburban brains crave scenes of women vomiting in the street and pooping in sinks a la \\"Bridesmaids.\\") The theater labeled this film \\"cine-arts\\" which scared me a little, thinking my husband would probably hate it. But since he'd been monopolizing the remote control to watch endless Military channel shows on the Nazis, he owed me Paris. Especially since I'd just finished reading \\"The Paris Wife\\" and rereading  \\"A Moveable Feast\\" and was longing for midnight scenes of lovers walking along the the Seine.     The cinematography alone would have been enough for me, but this was so much more. What could be better than visiting the world of American expatriates in 1920s Paris, meeting Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Stein, listening to Cole Porter tunes and seeing the beautiful sights of this lovely city. The wonderfully imaginative story contrasts that era with our own, as Owen Wilson escapes from his soon-to-be bride (an unusually bitchy Rachel McAdams) into the era he wishes he were in, only to realize that his problem was not the present time, but his choice of a woman. Sure there were flaws, but all-in-all a magical escape that left me wanting to see it again and again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this version.  It's just as fun as the pc version.  It's very responsive and great graphics.  Thank you
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love that this case is transparent since it allows the design of the iPhone to shine through.  The case adds a grippy feel to the iPhone, which makes you feel less like it will slip through your fingers.  The screen protector was easy to apply and didn't take a lot of fidgeting to get it to be bubble-free.<br /><br />The case also doesn't add a lot of heft or bulkiness to the product, which is nice since you paid for such a gorgeous slim iPhone in the first place.<br /><br />The one thing that bugs me (and this is true with all rubber-y cases: when I am pulling iPhone out of my jeans pocket, it clings a little to the pocket liner.  Not a big deal and it seems to be getting better with time.
0439023521|5.0|North America is divided into 12 Districts each tightly controlled and regulated by the the Capital. The Districts each have their own and unique role in the betterment of the Capital which most will never see but which will effect their entire lives. The Districts are segregated and sectioned off. To further exhibit their control on the Districts the Capital holds a death match featuring a male and female tribute from each district. Viewership is mandatory and tributes are picked by lottery. The catch? The participant pool is everyone between the ages of 12 and 18.     I was immediately swept up in the story of Katniss from district 12. The Hunger Games is another one of those great young adult novels that appeals to audiences of all ages. I feel like younger readers may not fully grasp the overall political and social commentary which i assume is one of the goals of this novel. Somehow The Hunger Games manages to be dark and disturbing yet a light enjoyable read at the same time. Cant wait to start the next book!!
B00499K9E0|5.0|I adore this series! Wonderfully witty, intense without being graphically violent; just delightful!  I've read, listened to, and watched just about every Sherlock story available and believe that this was one of the most entertaining renditions I've ever seen.  I sincerely hope that they make another season because this one was truly enjoyable.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|Great performance - especially for the price! I use this as a pre-amp for an MP3 player on my motorcycle. I've got my Sansa MP3 player Velcro-ed to the front of the amp and then another Velcro patch on the back to hold it onto the bike. You have to tweak on all three volume settings until you find the right setup for the application, but once done, the sound is amazing coming through my radio on my bike. With a full charge on both the player and the amp, I can ride all day and into the evening and still listen to my tunes!

B004EPYZPS|2.0|\\"Super 8\\" is to late 70s/early 80s Steven Spielberg fare what the Black Crowes are to Altamont-era Rolling Stones, or what the first Lenny Kravitz album is to \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"-era Beatles.     Which is to say, hugely influenced by it.     But when a movie owes as much as \\"Super 8\\" does to other artistic creations ... can it really be considered its own thing?     Critics were saying that after \\"Mission: Impossible III\\" and the recently rebooted \\"Star Trek\\" movie, J.J. Abrams was finally attempting something that wasn't a remake. But both \\"M:I3\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" took something old and made it wildly new (I'm an enthusiastic fan of both of those films), while \\"Super 8\\" is so entirely beholden to \\"Jaws,\\" \\"Close Encounters...,\\" \\"The Goonies,\\" \\"Gremlins\\" and \\"Amazing Stories\\" that it feels like a big step backward for Abrams.     The child actors are superb, the story has weight and the look is beautiful and stirring ... but the movie so busy spinning plates and hurling curveballs that I doubt I'll watch again. On the other hand, I rarely tire of vintage Spielberg.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I've read a lot of books on self-publishing. Most of them fall short when they discuss marketing. That's because even the successful authors don't know how they did it; their successes were either because their names were alread branded or the successes themselves were accidents.<br /><br />Locke knows how he did it, and he explains in readable language a method that is easy to understand. It won't work for everybody because not everybody is willing to do the work. But if everybody did it, its efficacy would be diluted and would stop working.<br /><br />Best five bucks I ever spent--on a book, that is.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|So i bought this set a couple months or so ago, and just found the time to watch all the dvds. I noticed after the first couple seasons that some of the discs wouldn't play. They would either spin really loudly, spin loudly then stop, or just not spin at all. At first i thought it was my DVD drive that was the problem. I went back and looked through all the dvds, and every single one has minor scratches on it (didnt affect the playing), and the ones that wouldnt spin at all had very small chips along the edges of the discs, therefore not letting them spin properly or not spin at all. Its happened with quite a few of these discs and i am very disappointed. I dont know how to send it back or refund it without my receipt or anything, since its been awhile. I am also missing this so called \\"booklet\\" that was supposed to come with the set. After spending 150 bucks, this is a huge loss for me :( and im upset that i missed alot of the best episodes!
1594744769|5.0|I have not been so taken with a book since the early days of Harry Potter. That's not to say that this book is similar to Harry Potter -- just that it has that same kind of perfect blend of reality and imagination.    The vintage photographs are unforgettable, and some a little haunting but all compliment the writing so beautifully. I loved it so much that I bought extra copies for friends. Plenty of other reviews have covered what the book is about so I will save the space and just tell you that you need to read this book, if for nothing more than to appreciate the unique approach Riggs took to illustrating his story.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I watched this movie about a month ago and have been struggling with writing this review. Not because it was a bad movie, on the contrary I liked it. The struggle with writing the review was right after I watched this movie I wasn't sure I liked it.<br /><br />After giving it some time to bounce around in my head - and not hit much else up there - I have come to the conclusion that I did like this movie. The casting could not have been more spot on. Both of the young actors are amazing.<br /><br />I think to some main stream American movie watchers this film may be to slow and lead to some jumped conclusions about quality and overall appeal. Maybe this is where I was confused. It is a somewhat slow paced movie, but that's okay because it works. It doesn't need to be a fast paced, everything blows up, type of movie. It's a very contained movie and has so much emotional impact.<br /><br />After thinking about it I do fully appreciate this movie. I give it a four star just do to some questionable CGI-type decisions that took away from me fully enjoying this movie. Other than that this is one I would really recommend to people who want something slightly different than mainstream.

B004XGWPXC|4.0|While I enjoyed this book and found it interesting to jump from year to year in the lives of these characters, there were times when it was frustrating not to see the events that immediately followed that particular day in their life.

B000Q7ZND6|4.0|great
B003L20ICE|3.0|The film begins by establishing the relationships among an unconventional family: a lesbian couple and the son and daughter they have had with the aid of sperm donated by a stranger. The lesbian couple come across as rigid, judgmental, perfectionist in terms of their own and their kids' achievements, and quarrelsome between themselves. \\"Intimate\\" conversations between each other, and between them and the kids, sound like they're right out of the therapist's office or a self-help book.    The older child, the daughter, has just turned 18. She and her brother agree to contact their biological father for the first time (they couldn't do it earlier because they were both under 18). The father turns out to be warm, easygoing, generous, and creative. He's established a successful restaurant, despite having dropped out of college. He's still single, and although initially confused, soon comes to love the idea of having kids.  He spends quality time with them, gives them good advice on their troubles, shoots hoops with the boy, and so on. He also gives one of the mothers her first job as a landscaper, fixing up his large but chaotic garden area. She's thrilled, and soon they find themselves attracted to each other. He also graciously puts up with the other member of the couple constantly insulting him.    And if this had been a French movie, the father would have stayed in this family's lives, and the problem with his having a fling with one of the mothers would have resolved itself in a positive way.  Instead, the highly unpleasant set of \\"American values\\" the family represents is upheld only by throwing this guy out of their lives so they can all continue without having to really grow or change. The father is bewildered, hurt . . . after all, the kids contacted him, they asked him for advice on their lives, he fell in love with one of the women and she seemed to reciprocate--and then, a door is triumphantly slammed in his face and he's told that if he wants a family, he should go create his own.    I really didn't like the message in this movie.
B0013LPS8E|2.0|I was SO looking forward to hearing this remastered CD because War is by far my favorite U2 album, largely because it was my introduction to the band back in the early 80s.  I was also really looking forward to the remaster because I always thought that the original War album sounded incredibly tinny with very little low end.  I was hoping the remaster would fix this, but it really does not. What a bummer!  One listen to Sunday Bloody Sunday shows how little \\"bottom\\" there is to this remaster (and the original).  When the bass guitar finally kicks in at about 0:30, you have to listen to hear it practically.  The bass simply has no punch on the remaster. Despite this I still love the album, but I hate the remaster.  Don't buy this just for the remaster.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Blade Runner is one of those films that seems to transcend movie making. A blend of science fiction and mystery, mixed with such a moody atmosphere that the viewer is both mystified and nearly overwhelmed at every turn, the film is definitely one that should be seen if you haven't yet. Mix that with fantastic attention to detail in every scene and outstanding acting (has Rutger ever done a better job?), the film is one to be viewed over and over. Top 10.    The 4-version package is a wonderful plus. While the changes in the final cut to the director's are few, there are a couple nice touches that help define the characters just that much more. And yes, the final cut is still without the film noir voice-over, for those who can't quite find that info on the studio descriptions.    Must buy, particularly at the price.
B000001FN8|4.0|I had this album in the 80's and i listened to it with satisfaction. It was the only one i had with Scorpions. Then i decided to buy the cd and it was kind of nostalgia when i heard it again. This album has really stood the test of time. It's well-produced and well-played. Every song has a life on it's own and i think the cover is really cool too. I recommend this album to everyone who has an ear for good music.

B00000DC7J|5.0|This is one of the most intense musical experiences out there.  As another reviewer said, it's not \\"easy listening\\" - the music is romantic and beautiful but also violent and challenging.  But the musicianship is stunning, (especially for me Fernando Suarez Paz on violin) and the inter-relationship between the musicians is almost telepathetic.  I was introduced to this record by a friend (who also introduced me to John Coltrane's \\"Dear Lord\\" - another very special recording) and have passed it on to several friends who loved it too.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Should people who don't usually like a genre review movies in that genre? I don't know, but when you've got an eight-year-old boy, you've got to watch some comic book superhero movies. Maybe this will help you decide whether you want to take your kid yourself or have some other adult take your kid and give them a nice glass of wine or a cold beer when they bring your kid home--or decide whether it's suitable for your child at all.     Just to give you an idea of my taste, not because I love to talk about myself but so you'll know whether it's worth your time to keep reading what I have to say, I don't read superhero comics and I usually don't like movies made out of superhero comics. I did, however, enjoy Tim Burton's first \\"Batman\\" and Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Maybe I just have a soft spot for \\"Batman\\" having grown up on the high-camp Adam West/Burt Ward TV show. Given a choice between a superhero comic movie and a romantic comedy, I'll take the superhero comic movie unless the rom-com has Cary Grant, George Clooney or Owen Wilson or is directed by Woody Allen or the Coen Brothers. I had never read a \\"Green Lantern\\" comic and knew nothing about the character except that the original DC Comics artist supposedly based the character's look on Paul Newman.    So, \\"The Green Lantern.\\" Ryan Reynolds stars as playboy test pilot Hal Jordan who is haunted by having, as a child of perhaps 10, watched his father die in a fiery test pilot crash before his eyes. This is shown in a graphic flashback that some kids may find disturbing. Ryan does not look like Paul Newman but he does look pretty good in his green superhero suit and has a certain charm about him. Blake Lively plays his love interest, Carol Ferris. Superhero girlfriend parts are hard to play, but she seems extra-dull. Peter Sarsgaard steals every scene he's in as a nerdy scientist who is infected by fear (more on that below) and becomes the embodiment of evil on earth. I hadn't heard of the rest of theactors except Tim Robbins who plays a corrupt politician. Other than the charming Reynolds and the morbidly fascinating Sarsgaard, most of the actors' performances are of the conventional, ham-fisted comic-book type.     Forgive me if I don't get the all details exactly right, but \\"The Green Lantern\\" involves a threat of destruction of the universe. Guardians are a circle of elders who are in charge of 3600 peacekeepers of the universe called Green Lanterns. The Green Lanterns keep the peace by the power of \\"will.\\" The universe is under threat of destruction from a fallen Guardian called Parallax whose power is \\"fear.\\"  Green Lanterns are mortal and when one dies, his special Green Lantern ring chooses a successor who must be fearless.  A dying Green Lantern crashes his spaceship and his ring chooses our hero Hal Jordan as his successor and the first-ever human Green Lantern. Will Hal live up to the honor and responsibility bestowed upon him by the ring and save the universe by destroying Parallax?    We find out through a great many very intense, very loud battle sequences and a few quieter scenes where Carol tells Hal he needs to live up to his responsibilities. The visual imagination on display in the Green Lantern is impressive. The special effects are well done. The pacing is quick enough. However, this is a very violent and frightening movie. My kid found some of the material too intense and at one point said he wanted to go home. (I always make him wait it out because I figure if he sees the resolution, that will cause fewer nightmares than if he walks out when he's most frightened.) Even I was feeling some anxiety at points,  and after the thousands of movies I've watched, I'm pretty immune. As we walked out of the theater, my son said he thought \\"The Green Lantern\\" was \\"really cool.\\" I kind of wish I had not taken him though.     There were no surprises, a lot of cliches, and an obvious set-up for a sequel, but overall I enjoyed the \\"The Green Lantern\\" more than I thought I would.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I hate most of todays pop music, but every once and then there are a few songs or artist that come along with some catchy songs and grab my attention. I am not a big Ga-Ga fan, in fact I am not very familar with most of her material, but I have heard some of her other releases, and some of it is pretty good. Some is over the top cheese for me, but she has a good voice and uses some interesting samples and grooves that are very catchy. I downloaded this release thinking that I could always just dump some of the songs I didnt want, but I wound up dumping all but ONE song. Folks, this is a very bad effort. I dont know what she was thinking, but this all seems \\"Rushed\\" Every single track seems to use the same beat or sample, and the vocal seems like it it 10x oversampled, with the I just ran my great voice through a vocal processor so know it sounds like almost everyone else that does it in the world of todays pop. With a huge fan base, and albums that fly off the shelves, why this? Why does this seem like its dumbed down and sounds like most of todays garbage. I guess everyone is entitled to have bad albums. Some greats have had some duds like Led Zeppelin and the Who, but..at least you could get some good songs off the bad albums, this is just B.A.D...and I am hoping that Lady doesnt decide to go with this style for her next albums. She's got some talent, no doubt, but thsi is just wasted..Avoid this, your not missing anything here at all.

B00127RAJY|3.0|Jillian is awful. I actually started to hate her while watching the dvds. My friend has the same video and hates it too. It is just a lot of lunges, sit-ups, jumping jacks and pushups.I have tried several times to stick with the dvd but always get bored. It is difficult but very repetitive. It is one of the few workout dvds that I never use. If you like Jillian than you may love this dvd.
0439023513|3.0|**There are many spoilers ahead**    I'll preface this by saying I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and, as a whole, the Hunger Games series is quite amazing. As much as I wanted to love Mockingjay, it was the weakest of the three in the series. Maybe Collins lost a little momentum, or she wanted her focus elsewhere, but many of the essentials that made the first two books interesting and deep--Katniss as a strong character, the emphasis on other main characters and taking down the Capitol, insightful thoughts about the harsh, dystopic existence--were somehow lost, or less effective, in this one. There are moments in Mockingjay where Collins apparently is back on her game (the passage with Katniss trying to decipher the meaning of \\"The Hanging Tree\\" comes to mind, very symbolic of death and sacrifice); however, the novel then teeters off into a narrative that lacks impact.     There were several misfires in Mockingjay. One, there is too much focus on the love triangle with Katniss, Peeta and Gale.  There was overexposure, too much of Katniss wavering back and forth and not deciding anything, then deciding something or hearing something and getting all drama queenish on us and pouting in the corner.  This overlaps into the next problem, Katniss. In the previous two books, Katniss didn't sit around, mope, and let others constantly make decisions for her. In Mockingjay, she is always on the sideline, letting everything take its course, but feeling conflicted all the while. Although Peeta is the one who's been hijacked, I would offer that Katniss has also been hijacked, and turned into a character with little initiative or drive. Another issue was the lack of focus on important moments. For instance, Primrose's death is glossed over rather quickly, but we are literally given chapters of summary about stupid, minor trivialities preparing for an apparent war (Katniss' wardrobe and makeup, technical preparations for war, etc).  Inthe end, Collins' book is an anti-war message, which in itself is not bad as she illustrates in gory passages how war impacts society. However, there seemed something a little fake and commercial about Mockingjay, especially the politically correct epilogue.     Still, I can't say I didn't enjoy it entirely. Mockingjay is a book that will make one think about the destructiveness of war and the over sensationalism of media, its good and harmful effects, something we can relate to today. Collins makes a point about the complexities of rebellion and nonconformity, and the ultimate consequences of those who are brave enough to rebel.     In total, The Hunger Game is an excellent series and should be read because it speaks much to our \\"news a second\\" media-driven society, where truth can be a bit blurry or exaggerated.     3 ½ stars
0439023521|5.0|While there were a couple things in the book that seemed a bit too fantastic and hard to visualize (such as the location surveillance cameras used in the games that seem to capture everything), the book was full of strong characters, harsh reality and cold choices. It's some heavy stuff for kids to grapple with. Katniss had a hard life as did everyone, so she's no nonsense and doesn't waste time complaining or day-dreaming; she does what needs to be done. She is the epitomy of what \\"survivor\\" means.<br />I enjoy the social commentary and the subtle jabs at today's consumerist society that's steeped in war and terror and enthralled with bright colors and fancy gadgets. I enjoy that there is no trite happy ending--how do you recover from killing and watching people die, losing family, and still have a fairy tale ending? You don't, and I appreciate that Suzanne pulls no punches.<br />At times the books are heartwrenchingly touching, at others starkly terrifying, but at it's core it carries a torch for honesty and bravery--which is simply the action of doing what needs to be done regardless of how terrified you may be. Bravery is a beautiful thing, and so are these books.

0685054667|5.0|Anne Frank The Diary of a Young Girl is an extremely moving account of the life of Anne Frank and her family, while living in Amsterdam, Holland, during the Nazi occupation, from 1942 to 1944. Hiding in a secret annex for more than two years, Anne Frank lived her young life under more than trying circumstances - cut off from the outside world. Her only companions were her father, Otto Frank, her mother, Edith, her sister, Margot, and Mr. Van Daan, Mrs. Van Daan, Peter Van Daan, Miep Van Santeen, and Elli Vossen. During her confinement, Anne became a young lady, a teenager, with dreams and aspirations. She wanted to become a writer, and she wanted to be loved. Her blossoming relationship with Peter Van Daan is wonderful, and her nearness to nature is never more felt than when she withdraws to the attic, where she gazes through the window at the night sky, the noon, and the magnificent chestnut tree. Yet, despite the horrible truth and the fate that awaited her, she never gave up cherishing her ideals, dreams, and hopes. On July 15, 1944, just several weeks before she and her family and friends would be arrested by the Gestapo, she wrote in her diary: \\"Yet I keep them  [her ideals, dreams, and cherished hopes], because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.\\" In my opinion, Anne Frank is a fascinating, intelligent, and courageous young girl, and we should always remember her. Thus, I highly recommend this book to all readers.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I have really enjoyed the Donovan Creed books so it was great to read John in a non-fiction tone of voice! I appreciate the no-nonsense advice, and especially think there are some actionable marketing ideas in this book that authors who are serious about selling will find valuable. If you want to write Pulitzer prize winning fiction this isn't for you - and Locke proudly says he's not aiming to write such books. If you want to sell truckloads - buy this book.<br />The principles I particularly liked included:<br /><br />* Create relationships with people and sell book by book - through twitter, your blog and then responding to email - yes, it's old school marketing in a digital age. I have also found my life changed through Twitter and blogging so I totally agree with John on this. It also gave me some new ideas around using #tags more and also blogging for my reader audience<br /><br />* Decide on your target market and then write for them. The lit-fic crowd will hate this but writing to a market is the way to sell. Fantastic,I'm going to spend time on this in particular.<br /><br />* Write a series - you only have to look at the top bestsellers to see this is true<br />* Treat it as a business - set goals, make a plan and execute.<br />As a businesswoman, I really appreciate this and think the muse will smile as well - there's no reason we can't be creative and sell well in an increasingly digital market.<br />Thanks John - I enjoyed the book - and recommend it to all authors keen on seeing the rankings and sales rising.

0439023513|5.0|Collins takes the book where it needs to go & the end result is predictable & obvious.   To steal a cliche - It's the journey that matters, not the destination. The journey was great.  There are plenty of reasons to read this apart from closure. Collins tells a fascinating story, you get to see who lives & who dies and most importantly you get to find out what happens with the love triangle between Catnip, Peeta & Gale. See if you can guess, I didn't.
B000TCEU4Q|1.0|The product is great at first, but the potentiometers that detect lever position are poor quality.  They will begin to fail after a few months and the lever positions will be inaccurate and jittery in your plane.

I am in love with every song on this album and I cannot be exuberant enough as to say how in love with Peter Murphy's voice I am  again!  Between the poetry in the lyrics and the stories he weaves, to the gorgeous melodies and vocal enunciations he uses.  His voice is used in it's most powerful ability!  He is obviously excited about his craft again.  Do not hesitate to get this with one thought or breath, this is a must own.  You will not be disappointed the divine voice has returned with a gorgeous din of delights.

He personally gave it 4 out of 5 popcorn kernels because he thought the language was too abrupt for him in some parts, but over all Good!

0765322889|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is a fantasy set during a particularly brutual war brought about by the expansionist ambitions of the Malazan Empire. Part Epic Fantasy, part political thriller it is easy to see why the author cites works as disparate as \\"The Singing Detective\\" and \\"The Lion In Winter\\".    The Good: The book is well written. Though long, nothing feels overwritten or unnecessary. The prose and dialogue move things along at a good pace and capture the imagination. It is certainly writing of a higher standard than one finds in most modern fantasy.    The plot is a wonderfully labyrinthine mix of swords, sorcery and politics. In many ways it displays all the elements that made 'The Wire' such a classic TV show; an excellent plot, depth of characters, moral ambiguity, grittiness and a willingness to throw the reader into the deep end with few or no explanations, forcing you to work hard to understand the piece as a whole.    The world of Gardens of The Moon is beautifully realistic. Unlike so very many other fantasy novels, you get a sense of a world vastly different to our own, with unique flora and fauna. There is a depth of history and sociology on show in the novel that is simply breathtaking.    The Bad: It is a difficult book to read. There is much that is not explained or qualified and it can be confusing. There are so many tantalizing threads of plot left dangling throughout that it can be quite frustrating at times. This is not light bed-time reading by any means. It can also be difficult to identify with many of the POV characters, unpleasant or inexplicable as their actions may be. For example the absolute dedication of a decent man like Whiskeyjack to an Empire that treats him as something less than dog-mess is simply baffling. There is also the usual gripe of having to accept a world in which bombs, gas-lighting and transcontinental flight are possible, but nobody has worked out how to create a flush toilet or a handgun yet.    In all however, this is avery good novel, well written, intelligent and produced with a style and plausibility that are rare in this genre, it is a must read for any true fantasy fan.
B00008AWNY|3.0|Well, I love the album. When it came I could have been any more excited to play it on my new record player but...........it was warped, unplayable.

0446691437|5.0|Several of my consulting colleagues mentioned the transformative nature of this book.  I needed to find out myself. What a magical book.  While Nike's motto is \\"Just Do It,\\" for many of us, that's easier said than done.  Or, is it?  I encourage anyone who has a long list of things they want to do but can't find just the right time, space, astrological alignment, etc., to read this book.
0307595579|5.0|I read the three novels--unfortunately out of sequence--but nonetheless I could not put them down and moved from one book to the next without pause. I won't bore readers with summaries of the plots or comments on the themes, as they are available below and elsewhere, but will comment on the general impressions I came away with after reading the entire series. First, I could not stop reading any of the three, although I found the first book (Dragon Tattoo) far less \\"fun\\" than the other two. What surprised me most, though, was that, in spite of characters and cities with the most bizarre names (Swedish seems to dislike vowels and loves to string together as many as 6 consonants in a row in its place names and surnames), and, literally, hundreds of characters in each book, I was able to track them quite easily ... Larsson has this wonderful technique that allows him to guide the reader through the maze he has created, a technique that I have NO idea about how it works but wish very much that I did, as I would love to try my hand at novel-writing. I think these three books have more characters than even War and Peace, and Larsson is equally as adept as Tolstoy at guiding his readers seamlessly through his massive, densely plotted creations.    My second impression, or reaction, was that Larsson uses the most ordinary language I think I have ever read in a novel (or novels). There was not a single beautiful turn of phrase, description, or flight of fancy in the entire series ... at least none that I recall. Perhaps this is due to the translation, but I suspect that he reads this way in Swedish as well. In addition, the author fills his pages with humdrum descriptions of ordinary life--e.g., (these are my words), \\"Salander rose from a deep sleep at 9 a.m., padded to the bathroom, showered, and dressed in black jeans and a purple tee with a bright orange moon and the words 'Don't bother, I'll fly myself.' She opened the frig, removed a carton of cheese and free-range eggs,cracked open two white and one brown egg and scrambled them while stirring in lumps of cheese. She turned off the stove, tossed the pan into the sink, and moved sluggishly to the couch to eat and watch the morning news.\\" I swear, the descriptions are as humdrum and filled with the ordinariness of life as the above ... yet they somehow compel the reader forward into the strange, twisted, sometimes extremely brutal activities that constitute the plots. It's fascinating (at least to me) that Larsson is able to draw us into his world using these tools ... one's reaction is, \\"Hell, I can write this well!\\" But the truth is, we can't write this well, or we would be best-selling novelists in our own countries. These are fascinating books, and I encourage readers to give them a try, especially on Kindle at a third of the price.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|There aren't words for how awesome this movie is. It's one of my all-time favorites and that hasn't changed since I first saw it 6 years ago. Just get it.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|After seeing the theatrical release and owning the original DVD, I was excited to learn that one of my favorite movies had a director's cut and was significantly different from the original. I can verify that the amount of content has certainly increased.    Most of the changes have been covered in other reviews so I'll just summarize.  1. I thought Orlando Bloom's performance was good in the original and I didn't think it was improved even though the backstory explains a little more of his reactions.    2. Eva Green's Sybilla character is explained a little more, but there was still no explanation for her and Bloom's romance.    3. The master gravedigger didn't add too much to the film. I feel bad for the actor because all his lines got cut (probably to save money) and all he's left with is a creepy stare (in the original). They could have given him at least one line. It took a few playthroughs of the original before I realized that the gravedigger from France had made his way over to Jerusalem and all he did was state at Balian, Sibylla or Godfrey.    4. The sword fight between Guy and Balian at the end was a distraction.    5. The people who were responsible for the theatrical cut actually did a good job now that I've seen the director's cut. They cut a lot of unnecessary stuff from the film and simplified a lot of things to make it flow smoother and get it to a manageable timeframe for the \\"general public\\". Before other reviewers go crazy and exclaim blasphemy, I will say that I liked both equally. Fans of this film are mad that this movie didn't do better at the box office, as am I. It's a shame that more people didn't go see a movie which actually has some values in addition to some incredible action scenes. The touchy subject matter and perhaps even the name of the movie may have turned the American audience off.    Recommendation: If you liked the original movie as much as I did (watched it multiple times) then you should buy the director's cut just to satisfy your curiosity (you aren't paying the full original price anyway). The extended footage is enough to warrant a purchase, however don't expect a signficantly better experience than when you watched the original.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is awesome and well-done for a cell phone game. I played the computer version and was so excited to see this released. However, I ran into a major, frustrating problem. After I had played all levels once through and was on 3-9 during the second time through, I had all but 2 plants, and almost all achievements, my entire profile and progress in the game disappeared. I had minimized to check an email and when I went back in the game prompted me for my name to create a profile -- I had obviously already done this since I had been playing for the past couple of weeks. I tried to cancel out but it forced me to create a new file so I put in a different name, hoping my other file would still be there. Sadly it was not. I was so upset I stopped playing because I couldn't risk this happening to me again. However, yesterday I received an update to my phone (Evo) and subsequently received an alert that my phone was running low on memory. I believe this is why I lost my file - the PvZ file continues to grow as you make more progress in the game. The file couldn't be contained by my phone anymore and just deleted itself with no warning. I have since moved this app, along with most of my other apps, to my SD card and will try to play the game again. Hopefully my theory is correct and my progress will not be lost again.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|This is going to be a very short review.. The story is weak from all the imitations, which made it very predictable.<br /><br />It has bits & pieces from the following movies:<br />- Independence Day<br />- War of the Worlds<br /><br />How many movies have you seen of an alien attack with one Marines unit kicking them off the planet?  Not to mention the gaps in its storyline, which makes one go 'Huh?! How.. What did I miss?' One unit thinks and acts better than all international brains put together.. A waste of talent, time, and money.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I couldn't wait for The Devil Colony and it was definitely one of his best stories. The author weaves another tale of adventure, intrigue and conspiracy while giving the reader the historical and scientific notes to differentiate between fact and fiction. Rollins is becoming very adept at character building and the emotions and personal lives of the Sigma Force grabbed me as much as the suspense and thrills.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Some may quibble with the premise of the book (that you might be able to sell 1 million eBooks in 5 months) or with the advice (relying heavily on social media tools) but for 5 bucks, this book is a fantastic value for indie authors.<br /><br />Sure, it might tell you a few things you already know but I'm sure there will be revelations of interest and of value.<br /><br />I particularly liked the section of failures as I had repeated most of them and nodded painfully as I went down the list.  Avoiding one or more of these missteps is worth the buy price times one hundred.<br /><br />The advice of targeting your book to a specific audience makes sense.  Even if your book is already written, as mine was, you should figure out who and where your peeps (target audience) are and hunt them down.  Once you identify them, use the social media tools to reach out to them.<br /><br />Locke does not provide any \\"how too\\" instruction on using Twitter (and rarely mentions Facebook) which disappointed me since I could use the Twitter help but I didn't buy the book just to learn how to use Twitter.  I bought it to gain the insights and perspective of a successful self-published indie author and it delivered on that promise.  I am now OOU!<br /><br />And the first work product from my reading John Locke's book?  My new blog:  [...]<br />And the second:  Follow me on Twitter @TheLastJump<br /><br />(smile)<br /><br />John E. Nevola<br />Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II
B0024Y7H10|4.0|Ignore the cry babies & whiners and watch the series if you are interested in the Terminator story and want to see veteran actors work with expert direction!<br />Forget that Fox abandoned a successful story franchise, again, and enjoy the growing passion, action and suspense over 2 full seasons. The characters are well developed by the end and the twists at climax are exciting! The \\"ladies\\" seriously kick some butt while John Connor builds a spine. This is a fine entertainment value and sci-fi aficionados will be hooked!
B000002G87|5.0|Received the cd in a timely fashion.  I was afraid that since the cd was remastered, that it would not sound as good as the original.  I was very happy that it not only sounded as good as the original, but even better.  It is suprising how much better it sounds without the scratches and popping from the LP that I had.
0596805527|5.0|Very complete book about the world of Javascript technology not just the language.     I am an experienced coder, I needed to code a web application from scratch with a lot of Javascript features, I got this book plus the JQuery Cookbook and I pretty much had all the tools I needed for the job.     What I particularly like about the book are the complete descriptions of the language features and idioms, the chapters about the JQuery library (a must-have-tool for web developers), NodeJs and of course the one about Javascript for browsers.

B001TMCBI2|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Personally I would go to San Diego to their clinic and learn how to implement this diet if I was sick.  I would also recommend reading Dr Max Gerson's book on his clinical trials.  We are what we eat, so why do we wonder why so many of us are getting sick? Most of what we eat these days is processed crap, genetically modified crap, and sugar packed crap.
B003Y74KAW|3.0|This is a thin silicone cover, but thick enough to keep you from denting the outside of your IPhone-as long as you don't drop it on the screen.  It is a good color, has nice ridges on the back for grip and stays on very well.  As I mentioned before, it offers NO protection for the screen at all-it would be nice if they'd included some kind of clear cover on the front, but I ended up using those sticky screen protectors along with this case.  Overall, there are obviously better cases, but for $9, this one isn't bad!

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Stargate Universe only lasted two seasons on SyFy. It just did not draw the same audiences that it's predecessors, Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis did. From observing comments by people about the show, quite a few felt the show lack any clear heroes. That there was too much in-fighting and bickering. Not enough action and humor. Sadly, I think they just didn't give the show's creative talent time.    As you view Season 1 and then Season 2, clearly the entire show had a intriguing story arc that was being revealed. What started in Season 1 as a tale of unlikely associates forced together for survival, started to evolve in season two to heroes dedicated to a new mission. Almost certainly had there been successive seasons, this show would have been another Stargate success. Season 2 was exciting, dramatic, humorous, and very entertaining.    If you enjoyed either or both other Stargate series, you definitely should add SGU Seasons 1 and 2 to your collection. If you only watched Season 1, you have missed out in many payoff of story elements set up in Season 1 that bear fruit in Season 2 and should watch Season 2
B000000OYN|5.0|\\"Saints and Sinners\\" is the 5th studio album by legendary hard rock band \\"Whitesnake\\" originally released in 1982. At the time \\"Whitesnake\\" had established their reputation as a leading hard rock act in Europe with continuous chart success in their home country. \\"Whitesnake\\" was the last album to be recorded under the original line up of lead singer David Coverdale, guitarists Mick Moodie and Bernie Marsden, bassist Neil Murray, keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice.<br /><br />Although most fans would consider \\"Slide it in\\"(1984) to be \\"Whitesnake\\"s major transition from a blues-rock band to an 80s-rock group, I personally consider \\"Saints and Sinners\\" as Coverdale's first attempt in the hard & heavy sound. Songs like \\"Young Blood\\", \\"Rock'n roll angels\\", and \\"Dancing girls\\" are prime examples of early `80s melodic hard rock with a spicy/kinky twist. In addition the album carries two early versions of songs which would later rank amongst the greatest rock anthems of the decade-non other than \\"Crying in the rain\\" and \\"Here I go again\\".<br /><br />\\"Saints and sinners\\" puts forward a great deal of performance aggression with speed, heaviness and technique moving upwards on the \\"Whitesnake\\" agenda of goals. While David and co always put forward song-writing, on \\"Saints and Sinners\\" the man decided that performance should weight as heavily as composing. Overall \\"Saints and sinners\\" is amongst \\"Whitesnake\\"s undervalued records although it can easily stand up to the quality of their later works. The album's commercial success also led \\"Whitesnake\\" headlining the Donnington `Monsters of rock' festival in 1983 for the first time.
0670022411|4.0|I had read a review of this book in my local paper and it sounded intriguing.  So I downloaded a sample of it onto my Kindle and was hooked.  I purchased the book shortly thereafter.  I enjoyed this book because it was intelligent.  As some reviewers here have said, it is a little slow but that is typical in the first book of a series and Ms. Harkness is clear that this is the first book of the series.  However, her explanations are necessary to understanding the history behind the characters of Diana and Matthew and more importantly to understanding their scientific work.  Honestly, I wish she would have gone into more detail about alchemy.  It sounds really interesting!      As to the story, I felt it was a fairly tight story without tangents.  Ms. Harkness focused on the primary characters and their motivation, particularly Diana since three quarters of the novel is told from her point of view.  Despite introducing various secondary characters, she did not spend too much time on their back stories and therefore, I felt that the plot did not bog down.  My one real complaint with this book was that it cannot stand alone.  Like the second movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars series, this book does not end but merely set the stage for the second novel.  This was a little frustrating as the novel built to a climax that never happened.  On the other hand, it is brilliant on Ms. Harkness's part to keep her readers on the edge.      I enjoyed her writing style and clear explanations of what could be difficult-to-understand science.  The romance between Matthew and Diana was somewhat trite though not nearly as obsessive as the romance between Edward and Bella in the Twilight series.  It is perhaps more adult than that relationship.  In short, if you enjoyed the Twilight and Harry Potter series, I think you will enjoy this book.

B0002ADY0Q|5.0|I remember hearing Uriah Heep way back but never got into them until recently when a friend turned me on to Demons and Wizards and Sweet Freedom. I was a big Wishbone Ash fan back in the day (Argus is still a masterpiece) and there are some similarities in their early albums - particularly their second albums. Both have an eclectic mix of hard driving rock, progressive rock, folk and jazz influences, and neither was likely to get much airplay. However Salisbury is a much stronger effort overall. When I first listened to it I was taken aback by the folk tinges of The Park and Lady In Black, but on further listening I really like them. I don't understand how the critics panned them - they are excellent musically, creative, original and entertaining. They were willing to try out new directions (maybe that's why?) and on this album they nailed them dead center - I think the critics display their own lack of musical talent and training by dissing this band.<br /><br />It starts out with the hard rocking Bird of Prey - I loved it on the first listen, though maybe the middle section is a little strange. The folk-like melody of The Park is actually a beautiful tune that grows on me each time I listen to it, and it's got that neat jazzy stop-time on the middle. Time to Live is another good hard rocker much more like their first album. Then Lady in Black - first listen was \\"what the heck is this?\\". But again, the more I listen the better I like it. I could easily imagine rowdily singing the chorus in my local pub after a couple of pints.<br /><br />Then things get progressive. First High Priestess has some neat time changes with a driving 15/8 melody (4/4 + 4/8), pretty advanced stuff for a rock band the critics hated. Then the title track - the only rock song I have ever heard with a wind ensemble playing - a very British touch indeed. And the arrangement isn't a lame commercial thing or a pretentious tone poem, it rocks, it swings, it energizes, it's the best orchestral arrangement I've ever heard for a rock band. A long song with many moods, great instrumentals all around, excellent singing, a hard driving jazzy 8/8 rhythm with the organ and the orchestra in the middle followed by a searing Mick Box guitar solo - wow! This piece is a masterpiece, the sound is vibrant and crisp. As a classically trained musician I absolutely love this.<br /><br />The extra songs are good, at least the first 2, Simon the Bullet Freak - a nice rocker that was on the original American edition - and Here Am I. Here Am I is another melodic vocal with mellow wah wah guitar with a great rocking middle section. I don't care much about the alternate takes, I usually skip over them, but they're fine as well, they just duplicate what's already on the album.er heard for a rock band.

1936594293|4.0|I always resisted reading this book. I thought that the old, female bounding type society was something I never wanted to relive. However, I came to truly love Elizabeth.<br /><br />This was another 'home book club' pick of my daughters and I, and we also enjoyed it. We loved the language, which is so well spoken and hilarious (Elizabeth). She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!<br /><br />We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.<br /><br />Now to why we only gave 4 stars. The Kindle version I have is FULL of errors! Also, one of our books had a HORRIBLE font, and was missing many of the illustrations that were in our other two books. I had to go to the library to get a copy for our reading group.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Although based on sci-fi icon Philip Dick's short story,THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU ultimately is a love story within a sci-fi environment.  Bolstered by the performances and chemistry of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, the movie does work on its romantic level, but doesn't elevate the sci-fi aspects.  Arguments on fate vs. destiny are fairly black and white and its climax inevitable.  Allusions to angelic intervention and greater powers arent fully explored and the movie's focus of true love mitigate any truly suspenseful moments.<br />Is ADJUSTMENT BUREAU enjoyable?  Yes, very much so.  Good support comes from Teremce Stamp, Anthony Viuvar (sp), John Flannery and Anthony Mackie.  The effects are good without being flashy and some of the camerawork elegant.<br />Although not as successful at the box office as Damon's action pics, it demonstrates his willingness to take risky roles and do them well.  And Emily Blunt just lights up any movie..she's that good!
0316069353|3.0|I just finished this book.  While it keeps your attention, it does bog down in places when we just keep reading the testimony of the various witnesses.  I do like the Mickey Haller character and will be interested in seeing if he pursues a new career as implied in the final pages of the book. I could not be convinced,though, that the L.A.P.D. and the L.A. D.A. would actually take this case to trial with such little evidence.  It would be fairly easy to plant reasonable doubt in the jury's mind given what little evidence they actually had.  So, I actually don't think that Haller had to be a great defense attorney to win this case.  The twist at the end was somewhat surprising, but I thought Connelly handled it well. Worth reading, just don't expect it to be your favorite Connelly book.

034552554X|5.0|\\"The Language of Flowers,\\" first-time author Vanessa Diffenbaugh tells the story of Victoria Jones, a suspicious, distrusting, deeply defensive product of the foster care system.  As the novel opens, her group home housemates set fire to her bed, she endures a lecture from her soon-to-be-ex-caseworker, and moves into an apartment where the rent has been paid for a few months.  Ending up homeless, Victoria manages to find temporary employment with a florist, due to her innate gift of creating beautiful, memorable bouquets.  Then, she meets a fellow flower vendor who shares her ability to communicate with flowers - and it turns out he is someone she has met before.    The narrative veers between the present-day, 18-year-old Victoria's reality and eight years earlier, when she was placed with a potential adoptive mother, Elizabeth, until something went catastrophically wrong.      This is an extremely moving, well-written book.  Victoria is a completely believable character, a woman who has been so badly betrayed and damaged by the system, she is almost feral.  She trusts no one, least of all herself.  It is difficult, sometimes, to watch her making poor decisions or lashing out at well-meaning people - difficult, but absolutely understandable.  People who are looking for a novel where the heroine shakes off everything or magically heals overnight from the trauma will not find that here.  The casual way Victoria recounts years of abuse or neglect just make it that much more authentic and searing.    The supporting characters, although almost exclusively female, were excellent as well:  Elizabeth, Renata, Victoria's employer; and Meredith, her platitude-spewing social worker.  The male characters, even Grant, her fellow florist, are less compelling.  The sections on the flowers and their various meanings were lovely and added a welcome touch of beauty to an otherwise harsh novel.  The Bay Area setting was also lovely, and well-drawn.  I also appreciated the appendix that included more information on flowers and their meanings.    Like others, I did feel as though the momentum dragged a bit in the middle of the story.  I had a hard time deciding between four and five stars, but the topic decided me.  This book draws attention to the critical issue of assisting foster care children to make successful transitions to adulthood.  It is a powerful and moving debut.  I'm glad I read it and will look forward to future offerings from this author.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Apple never discounts IPAD stuff, yet here it is- and it works. I plan to wirelessly netflix/ utube to my IPAD2, then watch it on whichever media I choose- Media Center, Bedroom (Both HDTV) or IPad2 (on the road.)Who needs ROKU, WIN HDTV, Blue Ray Players, etc? This baby takes as much space as a good ball point Pen. BTW- the reason for two holes in the distal end is that the small opening is the HDMI port, the big one allows you to still plug in the charger, so you don't have to be running your 10.5 hour battery down to use it at home. If you can't finish the show before it is time to go, just unplug and watch it in the back seat or when you get there.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|This movie was GOD-AWFUL.  The characters and script were shamelessly over-the-top.  The special effects were sub-par.  The ending was only matched in caliber by the joke of an introduction.  Cage must really be regretting this film, but given his performance he deserves regret.  The only (I can't say 'redeeming' because the film is entirely beyond redemption) element was the performance by the \\"Accountant\\" sent to reclaim Cage's soul.

Plus, the filming and dialog are so unique, it's unlike anything you've seen on TV before. I applaud Aaron Sorkin and now I understand why this show won so many awards.<br /><br />I've read several reviews that say they are unhappy that their aren't any English subtitles, and I agree, this should be offered. I did like that the entire series was offered as a box set, however. I think it's smart marketing and for someone like, that had not seen the show before, it was a real find.<br /><br />I thought there could have been some more extras. I don't love the voiceover commentary, especially on a show where there is already so much dialog.

It's that good.<br /><br />I'm a marketer, specializing in the digital realm and I've become increasingly annoyed at the self proclaimed Social Media Experts (SME's) out there. Most are full of hot air and sell snake oil. This is not the case with Dave Kerpen.<br /><br />This book is clearly written with great examples by someone who has a vast knowledge of this area. Even better, he uses examples of his actual work within the book for us all to learn from (most social media books don't). Each chapter also ends with exercises for you to start considering how to implement the concepts into your business.<br /><br />There are two aspects that separate this book from the rest. 1. Dave comes at it from the point of the user receiving the marketing and 2.Dave can easily be found on all social media sites giving out free advice, using the methods he describes in the book to grow his readership and business along with it. He walks the walk.<br /><br />While I don't agree with every element of the book, my quibbles are not worth your time. Just understand that this book is worth purchasing.<br /><br />I will be suggesting it to everyone I work with that suddenly wants to enter the social media space, but isn't sure why.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a review copy of this book from McGraw Hill.
B004WESFZW|5.0|The Adjustment Bureau - A hard film to stick in a particular genre. It's a Romantic Science Fiction film that deals focuses on fate and idea that a power out with our human control is manipulating events and deciding our destiny. Essentially this film is a love story between a hot shot politician (Matt Damon) and a up and coming ballet dancer (Emily Blunt) both on their way to greatness. This film works so well due to chemistry that Damon and Blunt have on screen. Dealing with such controversial concepts such as God and Fate is challenging to convey to an audience, but George Nolfi's seems to have managed to present these themes in a smart and digestible way. So far this is my favorite film of the year and I would give it a (B+) - Highly Recommended!!
B003EYVXYG|1.0|This movie is bad, and hardly qualifies for being a horror film. The horror film experience (instilling fear/terror in viewers) is completely missing, replaced with a poor attempt at a story.    This movie is about zombies right? Wrong. The zombies are the least of your worries, the people are the real focus here. This is a recurring theme in the 'Dead' series, but it is the main focus in this movie. It feels like zombies are absent from the movie completely, and when they do appear, they are dispatched easily most of the time.    The worst part of this film is the story. The story contradicts itself at least twice, ruining what little credibility it had before. Regarding a certain main character, you are left wondering \\"what?\\" for a large part of the movie and when your question is finally answered, you get nothing but disappointment. Sometimes a movie can be bad and at the same time really good. This one is all bad. I thought the acting wasn't too bad, a bit forced during scenes that tried hard to capture your emotions, nothing that could make the movie worse than it already is.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|What can I say? This movie gives you exactly what you're looking for. It has perfect action, perfect style, and perfect characters. Some may complain of its \\"boring\\" or \\"weak\\" plot, but for me... it's every action/adventure-lover's dream come true. The light bike scene is the hands-down best action scene this year. Apart from the action, the score of this movie really gives it life. Each of the tracks fit perfectly to the scene and gave me this weightless feeling that is unmatchable. So if you're looking for a movie to be amazed by its script and plot, rent The Social Network or Inception. But if you're looking for an expertly-crafted sci-fi adventure filled with spectacle and wonder, rent (buy) TRON: Legacy.     The Visuals: Absolutely Ground-breaking. Never before has computer animation felt so life-like; so realistic yet imaginative. The movie alone features the best visuals (in my opinion) available today. The Blu-ray transfer is the best I have ever seen. The best element is definitely the shifting aspect ratio which gives you an awesome feel every time it changes to full screen. Apart from that, the colors are perfect, the detail is so crisp without being overblown, and the blacks are astounding, so smooth and glossy that it makes you believe you are actually in the movie. If you are looking for a demo disk, look no further. Pop in TRON: Legacy and let your jaw-drop.     Now for the Audio: As if the visuals could be matched? The 7.1 surround sound is deafening: in a good way. Scratch that: in a GREAT way. This is absolutely the best audio I've ever heard. Daft Punk's perfect soundtrack will ignite your speakers, and every tiny sound effect will be present in your house. Sounds are crisp and clear, and action sequences will shake your house. If you had any expectations for the audio , you might as well drop them now, because TRON: Legacy shatters them all.     The extras: Many have been complaining about these, but really I am quite satisfied. Sure, there couldhave been more. But there are certain factors that bring up the score for me. For starters, the three featurettes about the movie were really well done; short but sweet. The \\"Flynn Lives\\" extra was spectacular, providing a great story for fans of the movie: one that gave you hope for a third movie. Finally, what made the disc for me was the incredible main menu: which is the best I have ever seen: Amazing!     Finally, the TRON: Legacy Blu-ray disc was everything I would have hoped it to be. Perfect quality to a near-perfect movie with a great amount of extras. I really recommend that you get this Blu-ray because it is one of the best available. The movie is the perfect blockbuster that is backed up with amazing visuals and audio. The disc will be playing in my PS3 for a long time to come. In terms of action and adventure, forget Avatar and buy TRON: Legacy as soon as possible!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great knife for camping & outdoors.  Extremely stout build, great slabs/handle (I added a ranger band to the handle for extra grip & it is glorious).  Fun part will be creating my own mods for the knife including custom wood handle down the road.  LOVE THIS KNIFE!  You have to hold it to understand the greatness of this blade.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as it was a good action flick. I wouldn't say it was great as I was never really pulled into the movie beyond the action sequences. Other than the main character, I didn't feel anyone else really stood out or pulled you in. Other than the main story of fighting aliens, the movie tries to tie in a backstory to the main character. The backstory works ok, but feels a bit contrived. If you just take it as a good action flick, you will like it. With the several alien invasion films out there, I still don't feel a great one has been made yet.     I thought the PQ was very good and audio was solid all around.     Although this won't go down as an all time favorite for me, it was enjoyable and I think I will watch again at some point.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game. While at times I find the movement frustrating, it was not enough to turn me off of it, and my biggest complaint is that it needs more levels. I have had a couple freeze issues that I find disappointing, and I hope they will be resolved soon.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|This movie is probably one of the best horror films I have ever seen. There is nothing really that compares. It is so beautifully filmed and shows how one mans success and obsession with being perfect drives him mentally mad. I especially love the scene where bale pulls the facial mask off his face. This shows the audience that there are two sides to this character. This is bales best performance in my mind(kudos to machinist).     I was a little shocked at the amount of dirt this transfer has. The dirt is noticeable and does get your attention in several scenes. Feels like you are watching it in the theaters. However, the dirt was constant throughout the film and thus I feel it was meant to be there. All in all though, the PQ was what could be expected from a low budget film.     AQ was perfect for this film.     I have listened to both commentary tracks and liked both. I felt the directors track seemed like she didn't know what to say on some scenes. It was still very nice to hear what she had to say about some of the most memorable scenes.

B001993Y3G|5.0|\\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" is one those movies that I've enjoyed since childhood. Action-packed, full of great characters and a terrific score by Michael Kamen all come together to create a movie that will stand the test of time. The Blu-ray release of the film is alright, but not perfect. Video quality is sound, though the Dolby TrueHD is inadequate (the regular 5.1 Audi is better). The extras, taken from the DVD release, are fair, but could've been better. Still, as far as Blu-ray goes, it's an excellent one to have for the movie alone.     Movie Grade: A+   Blu-ray Grade: C+   Overall Grade: B+
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Any fan of the GRRM series will be thrilled with this TV retelling.  It's nearly perfect.  Sure, there are a few mild complaints here and there but the actors were perfectly cast, the settings are ideal, and all the main points remain intact.  The show has become a sensation.  I didn't know anyone besides my husband who loved the series before the show.  Now my best friend, my uncle, my mother, my step-father, and several co-workers are as obsessed as we are because of the show.  They read the books afterwards!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I've been a fan of the predator series for a while(also with the Alien franchise as well), but I missed this one in theatres. I'm glad this was released on home video before my birthday(November 1). I rented this before b-day on dvd, but bought this the day after it on blu-ray. I'm glad I did. The film itself is great, and is also an improvement over the AVP films(I liked those films too  ). The jungle setting is re-used here, but it's not on earth, so that's good.     The BD quality is outstanding here. PQ is fantastic, featuring great detail on everything. Notice the detailed features on Danny Trejo and Lawrence Fishburne(their faces). It's incredible. The AQ is impressive as well. The jungle really comes alive, as with the carnage the predators create.     Extras are great as well. The commentary is informative, as are the making-of featurettes.     Overall, Predator fans will find a lot to like with this release. The movie is great on it's own, but the quality of this disc is outstanding(Great job, Fox!) Buy with confidence, because this comes highly recommended!
0316044695|5.0|To JDE:  Mr. Luttrell did NOT brag about himself in this book.  He wrote the book in tribute to and bragged about his comrades' bravery and perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds.    Lone Survivor was the first time I had ever written to a publisher, thanking them for printing a book.  I recommend this book to everyone I know.  It is humbling what brave men can suffer to keep us free.  I cried many times while reading this book.    God bless all who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|THE MOVIE - We have yet another Western Masterpiece by the late Sergio Leone involving vengence, revenge, mistaken identity, betrayel, double-crossing, and gunslinger stand-offs with Charles Bronson starring in the role of \\"The Man With No Name\\" (Clint Eastwood had turned down the role) referred to as Harmonica. The main story centers around the land of Sweetwater, a piece of land containing the regions only water scource, and its relation to the construction of a railroad station. The land is owned by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) who understands that the railroad would have to pass through his land and the water under it would provide for the steam locomotives coming through. But Brett, his two sons, and only daughter, are murdered by Frank (Henry Fonda) and his gang who are hired by railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzeth) as he wishes to seize the property for himself. Frank plants evidence on the scene to frame a bandit known as Cheyenne (Jason Robards) as the man responsible for the murders. Bretts new bride Jill McBane(Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans to discover the family is dead and she is now the inherent owner of the land. This sets the stage between a Tycoon trying to obtain the land for his wealthy gain, a hired gun to help in obtaining the land, a framed man, an unnamed man whos intentions are never truely known, and a new found Widow in the middle if it all. Charles Bronson does exceptionally well portraying Harmonica, a man with no revealing history or revealing motives for that matter. As Jason Robards says \\"He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks.\\"<br /><br />THE PICTURE QUALITY - Paramount has done a fine job bringing this film to blu-ray. Fine grain is intact given nice textures and displaying fine detail. Sergio Leone had a trademark of close-up shots of actors faces and you'll be please to know detail is very revealing in these close-up shots. Nothing in the way of much print damage is noticable. Edge Enhancement is kept at bay and very seldom noticable if at all. No signs of Digital Noise Reduction or at least that I could detect. Overall this is a very pleasing image.<br /><br />THE AUDIO QUALITY - What we get here is a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Track that is pleasent. Dialouge is clean and discernable. No major flaws hiss or pops to report.<br /><br />Overall this is the first film of the Amercian Trilogy started by Sergio Leon that ended with \\"Once Upon A Time In America\\" and has become a true classic Western that deserves to be in any serious film buffs library or minimium deserves your veiwing once. Highly Recommended.icable. Edge Enhancement is kept at bay and very seldom noticable if at all. No signs of Digital Noise Reduction or at least that I could detect.

B001EYU1VO|5.0|I own the Saitek 3D joystick which is 60% metal where the new F.L.Y.5 is 10% metal. Not as durable, but having said that... it has 12 programmable buttons that are much easier to access then the buttons on the Saitek 3D joystick. The stick also feels much more comfortable in your hand. The adjustments are easy and custom fit the stick to your hand. I keep the old Saitek 3D joystick as a trusted back-up, but the F.L.Y.5 is my new favorite. I've only had it a few days, so the durability is still in question, but it is so responsive that rough treatment in a game or simulation would probably be counterproductive. The design is well thought out and although superfluous the blue LED's are cool.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|One of the reasons that the legend of Robin Hood and his Merry Men has had a lasting impact on the world for nearly six centuries is that the story always adapts to the times in which it is told. And so it does again with the Ridley Scott-directed \\"Robin Hood.\\" This version presents an origin story of the Hooded man, from an archer in King Richard's army returning from the Crusade, to being declared an outlaw by Richard's brother, King John.     What sets this version of the story apart is that it attempts to place the story within more of an historical setting. And while it does play with some of the historical facts (Scott has done it before with \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\"), it overall succeeds at doing so. All the elements of the legend are there: The relationship between Robin and Marion; the Merry Men (Allan A'Dale, Will Scarlett, and Little John); the evil Prince John (Who becomes king in this version) and Sheriff of Nottingham (Less of a figure in this version); Sherwood Forest, among others. But there are elements of history thrown in for good measure as well. Most significant here is that we see the origins of the Magna Carta, the charter of liberties that the real King John was forced to sign by the nobles in 1215. In the film, Robin's father had a hand in its creation, and Robin takes up the call for the charter to be signed by the king, but to no avail in the confines of the story being told.     As for the film itself, it is the best of the Robin Hood movies that have been made. While it does have a darker and grittier feel to it, it still has the fun and excitement necessary in any telling of the legend. The acting is superb, the storytelling well-handled, and the battle scenes are quick-paced and exciting. While some of the history is skewered a bit, it still fits well into the overall perspective of the film.     The Blu-ray release is fantastic, featuring near-perfect picture and sound, and a good amount of extras. If you loved the movie, then you'll equally love the Blu-ray edition of \\"Robin Hood!\\"     Movie Grade: A   Blu-ray/Overall Grade: A-
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I went with the Canon version instead of a cheaper one just because thats how I am. I wanted to feel like I was getting an item I had no fear of not fitting or malfunctioning.

B004WCTLNY|4.0|Politician David Norris (Matt Damon) is shown in his unexpected rise to early political success.  He's a frontrunner for the New York Senate race, but then an embarrassing photo shows up and derails his election hopes.  He's preparing a concession speech and meets a beautiful woman (Emily Blunt), scraps the prepared speech for a spontaneous and genuine one that paves his way for a comeback.<br /><br />It turns out, though, he wasn't ever supposed to meet her again, it was never part of the plan, and when he did someone had to fix it.  The \\"adjustment bureau\\" fixes things, makes things happen the way they're supposed to, according to plans designed by higher ups.<br /><br />It's a very clever idea - as might be expected since the idea came from a Phillip K. Dick story.  It makes for an entertaining fast-paced romantic thriller that makes you think (a little bit, at least) about fate and desire and free will.  Lots of fun and definitely worth watching.

0375842381|2.0|This series was designed to cast doubt in a person's faith in God. It also contains child sexuality and homosexuality.    Book one is also a movie. The movie was far more tame than the book. The series is well written to draw the reader in and then you realize his agenda.  The second book introduces the plan to kill God who the series claims is actually an angel but since he was the first one formed he tried to control all of the others.  There is sexuality in the series as well.  Two important angel characters are homosexual and it mentions multiple times how in love they are (in books 2 & 3) and then in book 3 the two children mature and begin making out and fondling etc. Their love making saves the planet they are on at the time by creating more \\"Dust\\" the particles with intelligence. Watching the movie with fuzzy bears did not represent what these books are really about.  I am so glad I got them from the library and read them first.  My young kids will not be reading them. This series is for older teens & adults (and only those who are secure in their beliefs). Gifted youngsters who read at higher levels should avoid this book series.

But, I love that western style sound, mixed with some Social Distortion, OHHHHH BUDDY...  Once again GREAT ALBUM!

0545123275|2.0|\\"Shiver\\" falls short of the teen paranormal romance standard. The novel is well-packaged, from the blue print to the \\"temperature read\\" gimmick fronting each chapter. However, the heart of \\"Shiver\\" is as frozen as the Minnesota winter in which it's set. The main characters, Grace and Sam, have no chemistry. Their life-and-death battle is frankly puzzling in light of the writer's lukewarm portrayal of their romance. Gimmicks, packaging, and promising surface story aside, the novel lacks heart, likable characters, and a true grasp of the uniquely teenage experience to crush so hard on someone as to fall head-over-heels in love. Strange plot twists and equally bizarre side characters carry this novel far from what it should be focused on - the beautiful and complicated love story of its main characters.

0738711500|5.0|I have played with Tarot decks for many years, but never used the Minor Arcana because it seemed to hard to learn all those cards. I liked Rider-Waite, bought Tarot of the Witches but didn't care for it, then bought a deck with cats in the art. I like the cats but the artwork isn't my taste. I decided to order this set based on the reviews and am SO happy. The deck is very nice, I really feel an attachment to certain cards in particular, and the artwork incorporates the meaning of each one. My cat deck shows the Six of Swords as someone standing there with six swords and a cat. The same card in this deck depicts what's going on and meaning of it. They all are like that. Book goes into more detail on each card than another book I have. It's more specific. For the first time, I can learn all the Minor Arcana. Before, they all looked the same except for number of wands, cups, etc. Thought went into the artwork for this deck. Oh, and have to mention this morning. I finally had some good news via phone, something that made me want to yell,\\"Whoopee!\\" Went outside with coffee to read more of this book, picked up the shuffled deck for the heck of it and looked at the bottom card, it was Three of Cups. For one thing, it means a celebration of sorts, AND the page in book on the Three of Cups was exactly where I left off reading last night, bookmark was still there. I'm not one to put complete faith in this but it is becoming a fun hobby to play with! I totally recommend this for anyone who wants to learn, above any other book I have personally seen.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a publishing acquisition editor, and author, I've tracked John's rise with interest. At writer's conferences I use John's experience to show authors how they can make money writing. Face it, John's success isn't normal. Freaky, is what it is. But John \\"gets\\" the new publishing model. Anyone who's serious about staking a claim in this new frontier should read this book not once, but several times. Perhaps the best advice I can give potential readers are John's own words from his book:    On the importance of book sales: \\"If McDonald's were a book, it would get a huge publishing contract. Not because it's great literature, but because it has a proven track record of sales.\\"  On quality writing: \\"What is the definition of a great book? Seems to me it's awfully subjective. Some of the worst books I've read were considered world-class literature.... Your book doesn't have to be world-class. It just has to sell.... When you achieve success, you become the standard.... The more you sell, the more talented you'll become in the eyes of the public.\\"  On the allure of traditional publishing: \\"Most author hopefuls won't consider themselves successful until they've been validated by a publisher. To me, that shows a lack of confidence.\\"  On reaching your goals as a writer: \\"If you don't have a plan for writing and marketing your books, the only way you can become successful is by pure chance.\\"  On target marketing: \\"The best way to write a best-selling book is to know who your audience is (and what they want) before you start writing.    You get the idea. This book isn't about learning to become a great writer. This book is about learning how to become a great book seller. Regardless of who you're with, a large New York house or your own lonely self, this book is a must for every author who wants to sell books. Is it worth $4.95? Yes; it's priceless.
0811875040|4.0|As someone new to baking and decorating, reading through these recipes is a bit daunting. It seems most the recipes are for more advanced bakers, like the recipe for Princess Cake, which I love, but probably won't be attempting any time soon. I do love how almost every recipe has a picture with it and many have step by step pictures for hard to visualize instructions. Each cake recipe yields enough batter for a 6'' cake, which I also like, since big 9'' cakes usually mean leftovers. I love this book, but I'll have to wait for a day when I'm feeling patient to try out the recipes.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I hear a lot of people whining about edits, but that only bothers people who are bigtime Huey fans.  That's small potatoes if you just want a really decent collection of the best known of the group's numbers, and this collection is very well produced.  Somebody commented on the new wavey aspects of their early work, and if you like that, it's out there.  The only glaring omission on this compilation from the first album is the excellent \\"Now Here's You.\\"  Other than that, if you are looking for a good time that will take you right down memory lane, there isn't much here that will disappoint.  From the extremely catchy pop craftsmanship of \\"Do You Believe in Love\\" to good solid rockers like \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" these guys were a versatile and talented group who could play virtually any style that crossed there path.  Huey's character-filled voice never leaves any doubt who you're listening to, and his horn-driven band has impressed so many others that they are often loaned out to other artists, such as jazz saxman Richard Elliott.<br /><br />The band's strongest playing card, though, is their exceptional ability to take the term blue-eyed soul and make it all their own.  I find their cover of Curtis Mayfield's \\"It's Alright,\\" sung acapella, to be one of the finest versions out there.  This really is a decent collection, so don't be afraid to go out and get it.  It's alright;  have a good time!  Guaranteed you will, and you'll be singing along with it in your car too.

After receiving the item I carefully reviewed all the technical data about this item as it is listed on Amazon.  No where in the advertising does it state that you have to have a Macbook manufactured after mid-2010 for the audio function of the adapter to work.  This is very disappointing because that is the main reason I spent the extra money on this adapter as opposed to the older one.  This is the first time that Amazon has let me down.
0205191584|5.0|In my line of work I have to write a great deal and sometimes tend to forget some of the basic rules of writing.  I've had my own copy of this book for years now and reference it fairly regularly.<br /><br />I purchased a used copy of this book as part of a graduation gift for my 18 year old nephew who recently sent me an e mail that shocked me since he is an honor student at his high school.  For someone so bright his writing skills have much to be desired, no doubt in part due to extensive use of text messaging amongst teens (and some adults) these days.  Though he's majoring in physics he will still have to take basic general education courses which will involve some degree of composition.  He'll probably thank me after he gets the first C in his life in English 101.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Yeah!!!!<br />way to go!!!, when i first listen this album my head was unconsciously banging (that's a 41 years old  guy) and I rarely catch myself in such a situation but the fact is that it has it all. Although this is a guitar oriented album guitars is not the only thing you'll remember here. the melody the technicality, the power and the passion is all there!<br /><br /> Now in my opinion drummer Jason Rullo  put more effort on this one. It sounds rhythmically better with a jazzy touch and more cymbal adorns, double bass mordents and complex formulas added to the perfect result of an unquestionable rhythm platform. And this is very important because the other musicians couldn't do their job well without a good rhythm base. Maybe this one of the definitive (but not the only) aspect that made this album shine and stand out from the rest.<br /><br />By other hand Mr. Romeo is the master here, no question, he just ripped down the whole album with his killer riffs and solos. No matter what tonality or air or how difficult may look to fit all those notes. It's like walking over a bed of roses. Man I didn't hear no even one note, yeah I say it again. No even one single note from the guitar that I didn't like in the whole album! Everything was so cold calculated. Well what else can I say, Ladies and gentleman behold Michael Romeo, the new Guitar Messiah!!!!<br /><br />Michael Pinnella did an overall good job, his solo on Electric Messiah goes hand on hand with Romeo's and his arrangement on that song was perfect. I do some how encounter \\"when all is lost\\" a little weak but I doubt it was his fault, I guess it's more like an overall arrangement, for instants that song seemed unfinished to me. Maybe I'm wrong but the fact is that it's not at the level of masterpieces like \\"Paradise Lost\\" or \\"Lady of the Snow\\". bass was little weak too.<br /><br />I personally don't like much the way Russell Allen is singing lately and I don't understand why he has to growl when he has a beautiful and clear voice. Nevertheless he is a good singer and his job was not  far from remarkable.<br /><br />I hate long reviews but I couldn't avoid it, I had too much to say about this album and there is still more that I won't  mention coz I can't cover it all.  Some people said that the album is kinda dark and I guess some how it is but to me sounded like so many things that dark is not the only shade I saw. Lyrically it's not a landmark but I would categorize this album as a Beautiful one. It's indeed what drive us through an 82 mins journey.<br /><br />My favorites are Electric Messiah (perfect combination between Pinnella and Romeo), Dehumanized  and Children of a Faceless God. I believe these three are masterpieces. bangless he is a good singer and his job was not  far from remarkable.

Suzanne Collins is an amazing author and I can't wait to read the second book in the series. This book is great and I suggest it to people who are looking for something good to read because this book is it. Whoever loved the Hunger Games should read Divergent(Veronica Roth). This book is so good not kidding!

B00337KM2S|4.0|The novel, by Walter Kirn, is a far better artistic experience than what they made it into here: a feel good flick about the importance of family. The novel is mostly interior monologue by the incessant traveler played well by George Clooney as a corporate hatchetman. I guess they needed more of a plot, of course, to make the film work better. This is an adult drama. No violence, no shoot em ups. Not for everyone, only those with a brain.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|Well, the double LP is just what I expected. 180g audiophile pressing, plus great artwork by eddie. Sound is superb!<br /><br />EDIT: Compared this vinyl to my old cd version. Uncomparable, actually. Vinyl is much better. I gave it a 60% volume (wich is very loud on my sound system) and no uncomfortable performance. Obviously the sound is louder on the cd (its about the same volume when I gave it around 45% on cd), but the sound is all distorted compared to the vinyl.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

I actually considered not finishing it but I'm glad I did because the second half was so much better.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Grace Bradley, who begins working as a servant in the Riverton House, home to the Hartford family, when she's a child. She's close in age to the Lord's daughters, Hanna and Emmeline, and eventually after many years serving the family, she becomes a lady's maid to Hanna. As a maid, Grace is privy to many private conversations in the Riverton House and also becomes very close to Hanna.<br /><br />Grace narrates the book as 90-year old woman in a nursing home, bearing a long-kept secret about the Hartford family and their decline. A movie director approaches her regarding a film they're making about Riverton and after many years of not thinking about the Hartford's, Grace beings to relive her days as a maid. The novel moves back and forth between present day and the past; the present day portion of the book seems so far fetched...but I suppose it serves it's purpose to tell the story of Riverton.<br /><br />The book jacket alludes to the death of a young poet and a secret Grace kept all her life-and up to the halfway point of the book, yes, there are many references to \\"that night,\\" the family's suffering and where things would lead, but 200 pages of build-up is a little much. Once you pass the half-way point, the real story of Hanna, her husband Teddy, Emmeline and the young poet begins to unravel and the reading gets good. And the closing chapters of The House at Riverton are the best part of the book.<br /><br />Maybe a good beach read-and maybe more interesting if you haven't read or watched much about England in the early 1900's??
B001FES0IE|5.0|The vinyl is 180g and sounds superb. I gave it the first spin and was delighted. The vocals overshadow the rest of the recordings on the album, but I am sure that was their intention. I still have to play it at full volume to be completely satisfied, but I liked the sound of it.    It was as if I was listening to bohemian rhapsody for the very first time! After listening to it on the radio for a million times and on cd. Great sound.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I'd heard good things about it, but the description on the book jacket was cumbersome & I honestly wasn't sure how much I was going to like it. But within a few chapters, I was hooked.<br /><br />In a few words: An ailing author, Vida Winter, tells her life story to a young female biographer Margaret Lea. Winter lives in a spooky countryside mansion & Margaret moves in for the duration of Winter's story telling. Winter's tale is dark, mysterious & ever so interesting. The Thirteenth Tale reads like a puzzle. You find out about Winter's ancestors, which leads to her abnormal childhood & eventually to her current near-death-state, surrounded by the ghosts of her past. And Winter's tale starts to intertwine with the present and Lea's life as well. I flew through The Thirteenth Tale-it's totally absorbing and I'm excited to see what Setterfield writes next!

0385341008|1.0|I did start to read The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society--I gave it a try because it was historical fiction and short, so I thought I'd read it fairly quickly. But I only got to page 23 before I realized that it wasn't working for me.<br /><br />The story is written in letter format (as in snail-mail) and takes place in London and Guernsey Island during the Nazi occupation in WWII. There's no introduction to the characters-you just start reading letters written between author Juliet Ashton (her pen name is Izzy Bickerstaff), her friends/colleagues and eventually the inhabitants of Guernsey Island-and obviously at some point the society named in the book's title is formed. The little I read was hard to follow, not knowing who anyone was or what events they were referencing in their letters. The writing was fluffy-the prose in all the letters was a little too forced and formal. And I wasn't really getting to know the characters.<br /><br />I've read other reviews that rave about The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and call it charming and delightful-but I just couldn't read on.

0307463745|5.0|I have seen lot of management books which is really thick and having lot of theories and case studies etc. This book is entirely different. It's more like a presentation than a book. Meaningful drawing, minimal but informative chapters which will surely makes you think.<br /><br />People criticize this book as this book missing lot of ground works. A musician can demonstrate how to play an instrument. Even he play it for a minute or an entire concert, it depends on you how you want to make use of it. Those who want to get started, the basic lead is enough you don't need to completely understand how a concert would be. You can make your own.<br /><br />The book covers things general aspect and not really technical. It's all talking about commonsense. Go and read it. You don't need to follow an entire blog for years to get the full scoop.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|This is not Fleet Foxes 2 but a complex layered series of vocals, unusual instrumentals along with an original sound that sets them apart from just about anyone else recording today. The album isn't just more of the same from their Sun Giant album but builds on what they have laid down. Helplessness Blues doesn't just repeat what was done nor does it try to take them into some \\"new\\" direction but builds on the foundation that waslaid and constructs a more complex structural sound.    On first listen, I was disappointed, there was no White Winter Hymnal that jumped out at me as was in their first album. However, the more I listened the more I found myself being drawn into the complex nature of the sound and music. Helplessness Blue may not provide Fleet Foxes with the same critical success as Sun Giant album but for their fans, it was worth the wait.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I had two of these older version adapters (model no on the back: 01230954V1AC,10310954V1AA) and they feel really really cheap, and one has already broken.    Now this is the new version (S2-0002S), it can handle 2x 16GB MicroSD cards.      More importantly, its much better built.  Feel solid and less flexing.  The silkscreen printing on the card is also better quality.  I think its going to last longer too.    I am going to buy another one, to retire one my other old version adapter too.    (Note: I noticed that many sellers on eBay are selling the old version, I bought mine from eTECH, don't buy the old crappy version)
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I just started to learn the ukulele a couple of months back. So I was very interested when I read about Vedder's album in Rolling Stone. The ukulele has suddenly become the hot instrument and a number of artist have included its sound on their CD. This maybe the first CD in the a long time devoted just to the ukulele.    Limited in the sound that it can produce, the ukulele challenges the artist to get the most out of every note. Vedder for the most part is successful in getting every bit of feeling from this small instrument. By far the best songs are the original ones written by Vedder. Here he milks the ukulele and his voice for all they are worth.     Not everyone is going to like what they hear. the album may have a limited appeal but Vedder's name is going to draw a good deal of attention. For those that take the time to listen, they will be surprised at a hidden gem in this CD.
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is the story of a man named Okonkwo, an African villager. The time period isn't specified. Okonkwo thinks in terms of planting seasons, not in terms like '1856 AD' (or whatever).    Okonkwo is a strong man, a respected warrior and athlete and farmer. The first half of the book is a loose collection of vignettes of his life, showing his layabout father, his wives and children, how he makes his living, his village Umoufia, folk stories and mythology, etc. This is interesting stuff. The prose is clear and smooth. (It's detailed too. There's a 2 page glossary at the end of the book explaining Ibo terms.) You get a good feel for the characters, how they live, what their day to day lives are like, how they view the world.    It's interesting, but the first part doesn't move fast. I read it admiringly but coolly. But, about halfway through, things start happening. There is an accident and Okonkwo is, for a time, exiled from Umoufia and has to return to the village of his mother. That's when things start picking up steam. After that the book moves along quicker and quicker, and all the detail that you picked up in the beginning takes on new significance. I read the last pages in the middle of the night, unable to put it down.    One thing I would say is Ibo village life is going to disturb some readers. Okonkwo is a polygamist. He beats women. His tribe has a taboo against twins. He's not a contemporary western protagonist thats for sure.     Another thing I'd note is that some people might find the beginning half somewhat sluggish. To them I'd say hang in there, it's worth the effort.     Highly recommended. I got another of Achebe's books after I got this one. It made me want to read more. 4.5 Stars.
1582701709|1.0|In a nutshell the secret is getting what you want by using the \\"Law of Attraction\\". This seems to mean: -    1) Focusing on what you want rather than what you don't want.  2) Truely beliving that you will get what you want.    If this was true why dont:    1) Odds on favourites win every horse race. The vast majority of punters will back the horse meaning they both belive and want it to win.    2) The home team win every sporting match against \\"weaker\\" opposition - home supporters outnumber away supporters by about five to one. Every home supporter wants their team to win and because they are the stronger team, expect their team to win and yet sometimes the home team is beaten by their weaker opponents.     3) All cons fail. Nobody would invest in a money making venture if they didn't belive it would make them money and obviously they want it to make them money. There are far more investors in a cons than there are con men and women so the collective power of their belife should outweigh the power of belife on the conman or woman. Therefore, by the Law of Attraction, everyone investing in the con would make a lot of money rather than losing their money.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The best movie of the season.  All key folks involved in this project deserved reccognition on their performanmce in this masterpiece.    The great job was on behalf of the screen writer, performamce, direction, photography, scenery.  This was a low budget film - that outperformed all the mega million dollar projects that were put out this year. The acting ability of the performers were phenominal.  The portrayal of each charactorwas done with a kind of love for each character in this movie.  You left the theater with a personal love and respect of the monachy especially a deep respect of the character of King George V1.  What a couragious man he was.  W need more movies of that caliber.  Instead of how many special effects they can use and how many sexual scenes they can get into each movie.

B004UHF51S|3.0|I've been a fan of Michael Franks for 20+ years eagerly awaiting every new release.  The \\"Time Together\\" album is not bad. Every song is a story, as usual. But musically it's the same set of harmonies (although beautiful) that Michael has used for years. There's continuous impression you heard this before and one can predict next turn  in melody and harmony. Relaxing, mellow but VERY predictable.

B003UESJH4|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie with my wife.  One of the reasons I purchased this in the format I did was that it apparently included a 24 hour rental for Amazon Prime on demand customers.  I tried to use this rental via my Veria Cast television without seeing any option to use the rental, nor did it show up as available to be streamed without purchasing online.  I never got any confirmation that I could actually stream this content, nor did I get instructions.  In the future I'll likely not consider the free 24 hour streaming portion of  a purchase when making a decision.

B001992NW4|5.0|This may well be the most satisfying blu-ray purchase I have made to date and I wish all future blu-ray releases will be like this.  Like many other film fans out there I face a struggle at times trying to justify the double-dip from the dvd or even the vhs but this release sure made it easy for me.  Firstly, I'm a big fan of digibooks and indeed anything that is as far removed from the usual dvd release as possible.  The content is usually very informative and useful and it is certainly the case here.  Secondly, to have both the Director's Cut AND the Thearetical Release versions here is joyful for the fan (George Lucas try to contain your greed and take note!).  Thirdly, this film has been restored admirably and looks excellent and hence way scarier in 1080p although for some reason the picture quality seemed a little better for the thearetical release as compared with the director's cut and I'm assuming that it's because the missing bits that were added for the latter were poorly preserved and so to fit in with the rest of the frames some extra work was needed that brought the quality down a little as compared with the former version but I'm merely guessing here.<br /><br />The sound quality for both versions though in wonderful DTS HD MA 5.1 surround is simply stunning and certainly beyond reproach.  As to the various cuts argument I personally would have done a different \\"Reviewer's Cut\\" although I have to say that the original thearetical version was pretty well done already but I do have some sympathy with Blatty.  For my \\"Reviewer's Cut\\" version, I would leave out the \\"spider on the staircase\\" scene and perhaps the extended ending with the policeman but I would keep some of the ending like when the priest tells the mother to keep Karas' medal and perhaps just end it a little after that just before the policeman shows up.  I would also keep the staircase dialogue between the exorcists as I do agree with Blatty that it is a key scene and I disagree with Friedkin that it is \\"understood\\" or \\"stating the obvious\\"; sometimes with filmgoers you need to state the obvious for emphasis and I feel that to be the case here.  I would leave out the additional scene of Karas playing the recording of Regan's normal voice as in that case I feel it was not necessary to show how normal Regan was because I think we get it already from the beginning of the film although I would keep the added footage of the mother talking with the doctors.  There you have it!  This reviewer's cut! But all in all if I had to choose between the two I'd say the Thearetical Version is good as is that is until my Reviewer's Cut is made :-)<br /><br />This film shocked me and when I first saw even the censored version of it years ago as a child I have to say it bothered me no end and led to many a sleepless night but as I grew older and hence better able to see the bigger picture I've come to realise that this is a great love story with many facets to show that Good always triumphs over Evil and that even if it may seem that Evil wreaks all kinds of calamity and havoc and has the upper hand but in the final analysis Good still wins.  In the end, the priest who lost his faith gains redemption through imitating his model Jesus Christ; in taking onto himself all of the evil inhabiting the child and dying for her salvation he does on a smaller scale what Christ did in taking on all the evils of the entire world onto himself and dying for it so that it may be redeemed and live in spiritual freedom again.  Also in the example of Karas and the entire experience I think we can safely say that Regan's mother is no longer an aetheist!  I guess there are no aetheists in foxholes and in demonic possession!  It was very touching watching this transformation of Karas' character from the start of the film to the very end.  For me the most important and most memorable scene of the entire film was the one at the bottom of the stairs after the older priest sends Karas out of theroom because he was not cutting it and when the mother asks if Regan was going to die and as if in a Garden of Gethsemane moment Karas steels himself and decides no way!  I'm going to save that child no matter what and just like Jesus going from Gethsamane to his death on the cross Karas goes from the bottom of the stairs up to the room where he dies to save the child.  Beautiful!<br /><br />Next to [[ASIN:B001JNNDGA The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]]] this film is a great picture to encourage Christians everywhere.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This book had all the good qualities I like in my paranormal romances - loveable characters, full of humor, and great writing.  It reminded me a little bit of Shelly Laurenston's Dragon series.  The heroine is funny, strong, independent, kick-ass, and a little loopy.  The hero is all alpha male but not afraid to admit he's wrong (at least when he wants to LOL). These two main characters have great interaction with each other that makes it very hard to stop reading until the end of the book. The secondary characters are also interesting enough to make me glad the author is doing more books about this cast and crew.<br /><br />And I completely disagree with the lower rating reviewers of this book. The dialogue and word choices was not annoying.  She calls him \\"big guy\\" sometimes (but not as often as some reviewers had me believing) cause well... he's a big, dragon size guy after all!  He calls her \\"lover\\" (again not as much as some complaints) cause she is his lover after all! To me, the dialogue between the two main characters fit the characters.<br /><br />As for the complaints about the plot in this book - so what if it is similar to other paranormal stories out there? A woman meets a shifter (dragon in this case), they go through some danger (evil dark fae king and his army), they fall in love (he's her mate), and it all happens fast (about two weeks but so what? It *is* fantasy romance after all and I bet most of us wish love so deep and trustworthy could happen just as fast. Isn't that why we read romance FICTION???.  And this type of plot is exactly what attracted me to this book.  Personally, I don't want a completely different take on my paranormal romances and I could care less about \\"world building\\" as long as the story and characters are entertaining to me (which was the case when I read this book).<br /><br />If you want to read about a love story that's more realistic, I highly suggest that you don't look for it in the paranormal (fantasy) romance genre.  If world buidling is very important to you, go to the sci-fi or epic fantasy categories.  However, if you want entertaining, paranormal/fantasy romance then I recommend this book.  The only improvement I could wish for is for the publisher to lower the price.is very important to you, go to the sci-fi or epic fantasy categories.

B003Y5H54W|2.0|I was really hyped up by the Red Riding Hood trailers. Then I saw the reviews. Then I saw the movie. My opinions on the film went all the way from high to low to somewhere in the middle.    You need to know that this movie is from the folks who did Twilight. There is a commiserate component of teen angst that you should know about. If you can't stand a bit of that, stay away.    I am a fan of Amanda Seyfried and her wide eyed expressions so that is a plus for me. There are some attractive gentlemen for the ladies as well. The plot and characters are serviceable but unremarkable. Add in some nice visuals and it garners a 2/5 - watchable if you are bored.
0061726826|4.0|Imagine a world where love is a curse; a sickness to be eradicated. Falling in love is a crime. Love of children, of pets, of men and women, love of friends, relatives, teachers, all are outlawed in this variation of a post-apocalyptic US. And the solution to love? A procedure which erases the \\"love\\" portion of the brain for everyone who reaches the age of 18.<br />The idea is intriguing. Oliver presents a fully envisioned world to expand on her concept. The plot involves 3 teens, 2 of whom are awaiting the procedure, the other, an escapee from the regulators who attempt to insure that all eligible receive the procedure. The story is an awakening of a teenage girl to the harsh realities of the world she occupies. Friendship and love are called into question, and ultimately chosen as a new way of life.<br />A life on the outside of the regulated society is harsh;it is a life without the comforts of home, work, family, but it is a  life containing that one ingredient seen as most important of all - freedom to choose and to love. Oliver does a wonderful job of creating tension as the novel approaches its end. Her writing is crisp and descriptive. It evokes the feelings of all the major characters, of uncertainty, nihilism, joy, despair, emptiness, and of young love. While the plot eventually shows a resemblance to that of Romeo and Juliet, Oliver avoids the more classic ending to offer one which has just the barest hint of hope and redemption.
B002Q8GZ62|5.0|I thought the CD was wonderful for the music itself - I've noticed a lot of the groups who are trying to make a \\"comeback\\" (for lack of a better word) gussy up the music to suit younger listeners. This CD made me feel as if Spandau Ballet not only respected the songs, but the listeners as well. It was nice to hear them arranged smooth as silk with a hint of jazz. What brought the CD to an even higher level was that it was like having a brand new album from Spandau Ballet - I am so tired of hearing new songs from artists put on a CD with their greatest hits from the '80s sounding like, well, their greatest hits from the '80s.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you want a workout that will challenge you and change your shape, this is for you. You will also lose weight if you follow a sensible eating plan (I'm on Weight Watchers, so I try and stick with that...)    I'm down 5 pounds and a total of 4 inches since I started (I'm currently on Level Two.) I do supplement this DVD workout with Gunnar Peterson's Ab Assult, which uses an exercise ball, three times a week for alittle more focus on my core (fun fact: \\"Anita\\" from the 30-day Shred is also in Gunnar's \\"Ab Assult\\", to the left of Brooke Burke!)    I was very out of shape when I began 30-day Shred and was ready to scrap doing this DVD after the first five days, it was just really hard. I took a day to recover from the first five days and noticed that I felt stronger just from five days of the workout and a recovery day. I decided to continue and have not regretted it! I felt empowered once I completed Level One and was motivated to continue to Level Two. Although Level Two is also difficult, I'm loving finding out I'm capable of planks and all the other crazy, intense exercises Jillian's crammed into this workout. I'll be moving to Level Three in three days and look forward to the final results!

B004EPYZQC|5.0|The first Fast movie I saw was #4 and only because my son begged me to go.  The movie grabbed me from the opening shot, and didn't let go until the close.  I literally found myself trying to catch a breath at times.  Of course, I immediately had to go out and buy the first three.  #1 was so good I couldn't believe I'd missed it for all these years.  #2 was very good with at least one of the original cast and the addition of a couple of other good actors.  #3 was nothing like the others, but was, for what it was, watchable.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for Fast Five to open and was not disappointed at all.  We are huge Vin Diesel fans and love the Rock, so this was a real treat for us.  We've actually seen it twice at the theaters and will probably go at least one more time.  And I just preordered the DVD.<br /><br />No matter how you see it, though, sit through the credits for a real surprise!<br /><br />If you love good action movies, no matter how improbably they are (and really, anything else is just real life, isn't it), don't wait to see this one.

I'm perfectly willing to offer up my suspension of disbelief for a story. But don't ask me to stick my head in a blender.
B00026YO36|5.0|aka...\\"the epitome of cool.\\" I have been an enthusiast of Mark Lanegan for years after being exposed to his work through my love of Queens of the Stone Age. Throughout the past several years I have started focusing more on Mr. Lanegan's solo work and have recently started \\"back logging\\" his albums. I recently purchased \\"Field Songs\\" and have even more recently purchased \\"Bubblegum\\". Both albums feature songs that I was already familiar with but also offered new-to-me gems such as \\"Field Songs-No Easy Action\\". Bubblegum, however, is a collection of most of his work that I had relished in for the past several years. It is a recording that embodies the \\"Mark Lanegan\\" tone that I never needed to \\"grow\\" to love...it was an instantaneous love for the dark, gritty, melodic, down but not necessarily out, duct taped bottle blues and rock and effin roll! Bubblegum takes many turns and showcases Lanegan's range as a blues-man, poet, rock and roll frontman, crooner, drug user, lover and leaver. Haunting and echoing duets like the quintessential Mark Lanegan 3 string progression and brief \\"Bombed\\" offer hints of Lanegan's intentions while he follows it with the more hymnal, gospel from the gutter, masterpiece \\"Strange Religion\\". The album resembles the roller-coaster of a drug binge with it's ascensions in upbeat/tempo speed reactions separated by the descending \\"come down\\" tracks. As an album it is one of the best of modern music. As a mere collection of songs it is a showcase of true talent and vision that is and should be accessible to mainstream America. Mark Lanegan is what American music should be. He is what a professional artist should and even has the back-story to validate his work...he's no Burkley graduate \\"Blues Hammer\\" wanna-be who learned some blues chords, heard a record and went to town. He has lived the life and has just about died in it too, but as his music suggest, it's this breed of grit that doesn't go down easily, if ever. Bubblegum , like Lanegan, is a must have for music fans of all genres.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|The 1st 5 minutes and the last 15 minutes are watchable.  The rest is a bunch of uninteresting drama set behind the vague backdrop of an alien invasion.    The characters are presented in a way that makes them uninteresting.  we never care if any or all of them die.  The dialogue is so phony and 3rd gradish that it made me want to watch a good movie about marines instead.
B003UESJEM|5.0|A lot of reviewers were put off by the fact that the movie was about wealthy, successful, men with nice homes, cars, etc.   Well, the higher they are the harder they fall.  It isn't difficult to feel some sympathy watching a six figure executive interview (and be rejected) for a job at half his former salary, losing his home, moving back with his parents, and enduring multiple humiliations.  I applaud the film for addressing age discrimination.  Not only for those in their 50s and 60s, but even the key role being turned down for a job at age 37 because \\"new college graduates will work 90 hours a week at less pay\\".  The personal coach tells an unemployed 50 something, that he needs to dye his hair, eliminate any reference to Vietnam, and all the \\"ancient pre-90s\\" items from his resume.  Sound familiar to anyone?  You leave out dates and some of your key accomplishments because it was too long ago, but what happens when they look at you during the interview - you'll need more than hair dye.  The movie also pointed out the realities of co-worker reactions to a layoff - they ask if their position will be cut, rather than showing any compassion for the poor guy packing his personal items from his desk in a box.  It also focuses on the fact that, since the U.S. essentially gave up on production, we've lost decent, honest jobs that provided a living wage to hundreds of thousands of workers.  The ending to movie was good.  Not the typical rosy, all is well conclusion, but a new beginning for some of the Great Recession casualties - it may or may not work out, but returning to a workplace where employees are valued is refreshing, and perhaps hopeful.
B004SBX112|2.0|when is this thing gonna be updated with the new summer levels? it's out for everyone else but Amazon as usual. catch up, will ya!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is the best saga of all time, so I cannot wait til release date to watch all the films and the extras on one week marathon.
B004WCTLNY|2.0|I can't add Adjustment Bureau to the list of Philip K Dick adapted films that I like. It is rather sappy and also entirely predictable. You know those films where from the beginning you think, \\"I hope this doesn't end the the way I'm expecting it to from the first 10 minutes\\"? Well, this is one of them. I also feel that it fails as an exploration of religion and free will. I hope someone can tell me the short story was better.    The acting and production were perfectly competent. But this is an archetypical story that's been told so many times it needs a little something extra for me to be interested these days. Maybe I've seen too many movies.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is an excellent game. It's fun, easy to learn, and easy to get into. It also has quality visuals and runs lag-free. The only down side for me is the long load times.
0385341008|4.0|I wanted to read it for quite some time because I'm naturally drawn to books with strange titles, titles that make no sense until you dive in and discover the meaning. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society is one of the oddest titles in book history but don't let it fool you, the journey to the title's meaning is entertaining and intriguing.<br /><br />I also love novels that take me away to a land far, far away. The Guernsey Island isn't remote but it's still a whimsical place to travel, in the sense of reading, anyway. A little time travel doesn't hurt either, so I knew 1946 and WWII would add depth to the story-I didn't know it was the heart between the pages. With it, we learn a nearly first-hand account of life during the Nazi occupation--the hiding of pigs, the desperate lies to save a life and Elizabeth, the affable friend everyone gravitates toward.<br /><br />Then I flipped through the pages and saw letters. All those old-fashion, `what-people-did-before-email' letters. That was the clincher, the come-home-with-me moment. A lovely read.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Eminem at his finest, Royce da 5'9 finally getting some of the notoriety he deserves, what more can you ask for? Instant download...guaranteed! Gladly paid for this album.
0486278077|5.0|This was so intersting you do not want want to put down, very much a book you can get lost into
B000002LCB|1.0|It's a good thing that we all have different tastes I guess.  Mark Knopfler is one of my very favorite recording artists, and I have all his stuff, so I thought I should buy this, since he wrote the tracks.  Boy, what a surprise.  It's all horrible, nasty and ugly and I can't stand to even have it on.  Maybe it would work in the movie, but not on the stereo!
B004EPYZOO|3.0|Drive Angry definitely has some problems. The plot has some large points I feel should have been cleared up and the pacing is a bit uneven. But Nick Cage does a good job of kicking ass and Amber Heard created a surprisingly likable character. I had my doubts about her role in this film but she kind of impressed me.    Also, the movie is silly and over the top. I like that. There is one particular shootout that had me laughing the whole time - you'll know it when you see it. Fire this one up on one of those nights you have nothing else to do.
1572816295|5.0|This deck is my second deck I've ever owned. Let me tell you, this is the first time I've felt a connection to the cards and been able to give a detailed reading. This deck has certainly given me confidence in my ability to read! If you're a collector, this deck is the most beautiful one I've seen. The art is so intricate and detailed, done in pen and watercolor. This style gives the cards a very dreamy, soft look. You can tell Paulina poured her heart into these cards, the little white book that comes with it also explains her interpretations of the cards. These are based on the Rider-Waite deck. Paulina Tarot has been worth the investment, money and spirit.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was the first work-out dvd I've ever bought, as I've always been a runner. However, I noticed that I couldn't budge the excess fat around my stomach and inner thighs just with running, so I decided to try something different. This dvd is essentially interval training, and is a mix of really high-impact (if you do the hard versions of the exercises) and moderate impact exercises. You really don't stop moving for 25 minutes, and it absolutely kills you- at the end of the work-out you feel like collapsing. But I absolutely love it because of the results I've gotten. I'm 5'6\\" and 121 pounds, and in the two weeks that I've done this dvd (5 days per week) I've lost about 50% of the excess fat I had (measured by pinch-test). It's freaking amazing. Plus, I just feel so much stronger- walking around I can feel my leg muscles moving and contracting. Plus, and possibly best of all, I've lost about 70% of my cellulite. I cannot recommend this dvd enough. Jillian has designed the perfect work-out.    The only criticism I would have is that a couple of my jackets are getting tighter around the shoulders, and I don't want to look like a man, so I might scale back some of the arm weight exercises. Plus, if you have knee or ankle problems you're really going to struggle with this, as the impact on your joints is pretty big.
0545123275|3.0|....but not good enough to want to read the sequel.  I thought this is what \\"would-have-been\\" if Bella had never met Edward in Twilight, but since they were not the same characters, I wasn't as invested.  It seems like when there is one book about vampires/werewolves; there's a thousand.  And to me...when you've read one, you've read them all.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This movie was fun to watch and a excellent example of very good amime. I recommend this blu-ray movie for kids and adults alike. The english dubbing was clear and to the point.
B004LROMSO|2.0|I hoped against hope that this show would get better.  Never did.  The acting was abominable, the casting of a weasel-faced tween as Arthur is laughable at best, and the relationships were hamhanded and superficial.  The show has a production quality of campier things like Xena and Hercules... actually a lot worse in some cases.  The greatest sin is that with this level of camp, there's no wit to go with it.  No wink to the audience to let us know \\"Hey, it's just for fun.\\"  Nope... they want you to take this godawful show seriously.  In a time where we can watch Spartacus or Game of Thrones as a way to gorge ourselves on wicked political intrigue, fantastic scapes and savage contests of martial brutality, this show falls short in every category.  Save your money.  While this show is on a premium channel, it's cable access quality.  My condolences to Claire Forlani and Joseph Fiennes' career choices.  Many happy returns, you poor lot.
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|Stake Land is not a big budget movie. The special effects suffer if you look too closely, but they are typically shot in such a way that it's not too noticeable. The movie itself is actually quite good. I was surprised to discover that I actually cared about the characters even though we really don't learn a ton about them besides what we see them do.    The plot is not \\"dudes mow down tons of zombies with big guns\\". It's dark and brutal and real. There is one part near the end that is incongruous - more of an action horror film type of event - but not over much is made of it.    Stake Land is a step up from many big budget zombie movies. Its director really makes the most of his resources and shows some real skill. The ending is rather open ended, so be warned if you hate those.  That aside, I would definitely recommend it.
B004BA5HNU|5.0|This book was an unknown for me as I hadn't read any of the authors books. I have found it keeps me in suspense as to what will happen next. It isn't a murder mystery, but some dark truths come out in the story from  the past. The story weaves back and forth in time, leaving you wondering whether you can keep your eyes open long enough to get through the next chapter(obviously, while reading at night).It is centred around the relationship Edie has with her mother and  the family that inhabits Milderhurst Castle.  When the author describes the inside of the castle , you get the feeling that you are there in the dampness and mystery that surrounds the 3 sisters who still live there. A joy to read.
0545265355|5.0|Everything that was in the hands of Amazon was handled perfectly. The box set itself was in wonderful condition and it was delivered on time, even though I chose the super-saver shipping. As for Suzanne Collins, I have read very few books that are as good as these three. I would recommend this box set as the best gift for anyone between ages 12 and 18. Collins writes the trilogy fairly simply, there are not many complicated rhetorical devices used. This makes for a thoroughly pleasurable read. Though each book was 400 pages, I found that I couldn't stop myself and wound up reading the whole 1200 page trilogy in a week. I'm not the only one either, nearly everybody I have talked to (also in my age group, I am 18) took a week to read the trilogy. I don't want to give up any spoilers as this trilogy is packed with twists but any parent looking at this product as a gift for their child or for any kid in that age group should certainly consider this box set as one of the best gifts. And, an added bonus: it will get them to read-and love every second of it! I am even a child myself (at heart and in age) and I am saying this. Two thumbs up for The Hunger Games Trilogy!
B004Z4LVZK|3.0|When I finished the book, I wanted to read more, but as time went by and waited on The Scorch Trials to be released, I lost interest. If it had already been out, I may have went ahead and read more of the series.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I have enjoyed every Amazon Basics product that I have received to date. This product is no different. The case is a no-frills, standard issue protective case. For me, that is perfect. It does its job as far as protecting the phone goes and it doesn't look bad or detract from the attractive design of the phone itself.<br /><br />I have had several encounters with screen protectors of different brands and Amazon's are consistently among the cheapest in price yet highest in quality. The included cleaning cloth and scraper make installation a breeze and, amazingly, it actually fits the screens dimensions almost perfectly.<br /><br />This is another solid and economically sound product from Amazon Basics.
B0034G4P80|2.0|We went to see this one in the theater and I was pretty underwhelmed. I had two main problems with it:    1) The romance with Natalie Portman was totally superfluous. It was only there because the focus groups say you have to have a romance. I know that's status quo but I'm getting tired of it.    2) I hated the treatment of the Norse myth. Admittedly I should have expected that from Marvel, but the actual Norse legends are so much more...alive than what we get in this movie. It reduced archetypal gods to cardboard cutout aliens with the same names. Loki wasn't even a shadow of his namesake.    The special effects were pretty good. It wasn't a terrible movie by any means, just a let down.
B00008CLOA|5.0|It's hard to believe that a Album recorded over a decade before I was even born can sound so amazing on SACD.  This is an excellent SACD and one you can demo.    I would recommend this SACD.
030726999X|5.0|I bought this trilogy after seeing the Swedish movies.  It's amazing how closely the movies follow the books.  In the US they would have used the titles and taken \\"artistic license\\" with the content. I guess you could call the books procedural thrillers.  The violence is disquieting but necessary to the story line. The primary characters are very believable.  Even the \\"good guys\\" have their share of flaws. The various story lines leading to the conclusion are quite engrossing. I especially like the references to computer technology.  The abuse of power by government agencies is quite apt in these trying times. It's a shame Larsson didn't live to produce more work. Highly recommended for the discerning adult reader.
B001TODO54|5.0|This book was great.  I love that there is a map in front to show you exactly what regions are what.  And the plot keeps your interest, page after page.  The companion novel Fire is even better, but I hate that the third book: Bitterblue got cancelled.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is the best cd I have heard in a long while.  The band is amazing, with an incredible sound.  I enjoy every song on this cd, and can listen to it over and over.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Paul is an entertaining film. It's not often laugh out loud funny, but it maintains a steady level of comedy throughout the movie. If you've ever seen a Nick Frost and Simon Pegg collaboration then you know the effortless chemistry they bring to the table. Seth Rogen is one of those guys that amuses me just by talking so he's a perfect fit for the voice of the alien.     The script takes some snarky shots at religion. It was a little surprising in a mainstream film, but that only endeared it to me.     The plot is fairly predictable. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey and Paul is a pleasant way to travel a couple hours into your future.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie is great, but I wont' review the movie that's subjective.    This Blu-ray looks amazing.  The variable aspect ratio was very confusing at first.  I had to do some research that showed that this movie was filmed using two cameras.  The IMax camera used is not as wide aspect ratio as most movies, and on this Blu-ray it's 16:9.  The rest of the movie is filmed on a normal camera and is wide screen.  In the end I'm glad they used varable aspect ratio to maintain the original aspect ratios.    The sound is only 5.1 which is unfortunate, but that's all that was available I suspect.    I would recommend this Blu-Ray
B003Y5H556|1.0|The whole concept of this movie probably sounded good when the writers brought the idea to the movie studio, but what was translated to the screen was just really BAD!!
0345529057|1.0|Don't buy this set!  The print is so small, like reading footnotes.  Get some other edition.  This is just AWFUL.  They should have said how tiny the print was, I never would have bought it if I had seen what is looked like first.  Shame, shame, shame!!!  Cheating people.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I've had this cd for months and is constantly on replay in the house and in the car.  I love it!
014241543X|5.0|If I Stay is a masterpiece.  The story is beautifully written, just lovely.  I would highly recommend this (and I haven't been a \\"young adult\\" in a long time!)
0385751060|3.0|I know this book has been praised to the heavens, but I consider it far inferior to books like Schindler's List and the Maus graphic novel in dealing with the Holocaust. The main character is too unbelievable for what's going on, and the writing attempts a wide-eyed innocence in its simple sentences, as though its trying to tell a four-year-old about the high fences and the mud and the ovens and so on. Which is a bit absurd. How do you \\"simply\\" explain mind-numbing evil and genocide?     The idea that a 9 year old German boy is oblivious to the Jewish question is ridiculous. As is his easy ability to talk to the boy in the camp. As is the book's climax. But because the book is about an important topic, it seems to be forgiven these implausibilities. The tone was a Hallmark version of the Holocaust, and that rubbed me the wrong way.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I've made a real effort to spend more time with my kids this summer. Watching the Justin Bieber movie on Father's Day and making fun of it was one way of accomplishing this goal. Watching \\"Despicable Me\\" with the whole family was an even better way.<br /><br />When my 16 year old daughter and 10 year old son suggested this as our next movie to watch together, I thought it would be about the same as most of the other animated kids movies we watch: a few funny moments, too cute for me, predictable plot line, and not much else. While the plot line was predictable, as well as the attempt to pull on the emotional heart strings, I'm still going to give this movie 5 stars.<br /><br />Why? Humor value. While there's not much redeeming moral value to \\"Despicable Me\\" (aside from the trite message of how 3 little kids melt a villain's heart), there also isn't much that's offensive.<br /><br />But most importantly, the movie is very, very funny. I was amazed at how many times I genuinely laughed at the movie. The villain, Gru, has the most whimsical and slightly demented vehicle and house, filled with mutant dog, many minions that remind me of Veggie Tale characters, an iron maiden, etc. etc. Time and again the way the characters and set were designed delighted me and my kids because they were so comical.<br /><br />The way that things go hilariously wrong for Gru and the wild set design make this movie like a feature length Bugs Bunny cartoon. One of my favorite scenes is seeing Gru with the almost non-existent forehead and skinny, skinny legs dancing at the end of the movie. Or then there's the scene where Gru tells his henchman to make a dart gun but instead the henchman creates a gun that emits a noxious gas that knocks people out. The encounters between Gru and another super-villain, Vector, are also very funny.<br /><br />The filmmakers worked hard to choose the best improvisational actors to do the voices, and I'm sure casting Steve Carell as Gru added a lot to the movie's humor.<br /><br />While some might like the touching scenes with the three girls Gru adopts, for me the value of the movie is that it made me laugh - and it did so more than most other comedies I've ever watched. Even without any other or higher purpose, any movie that's this inventive and funny gets 5 stars from me.he touching scenes with the three girls Gru adopts, for me the value of the movie is that it made me laugh - and it did so more than most other comedies I've ever watched.

B000003JAB|5.0|I have to confess that I was never all that much of a fan of Robin Trower. This is the one record I have by him and I bought the LP after hearing the irresistible \\"Day of the Eagle\\" on the radio back in the day. Then I bought the CD when it came out.     This work is easily the highlight of Robin's career for me. Every texture, every lick and every thump of the late, great Jimmy Dewar's bass is perfectly placed for optimum emotional, melodic and harmonic effect and Dewar's vocals are soulful beyond belief. Aside from \\"Day of the Eagle,\\" which just destroys, the title track is bloody epic and one could almost lose oneself in the sonic landscape of it.     And \\"Lady Love\\" is just so cool and funky it cannot be denied.    A masterpiece that will live on long after I am gone.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|Graphics are good  Interface is easy enough, but has some quarks  Replay value is good  Enjoyable gameplay  Value for price is good  Works on XOOM stock 3.1
B004I1AGTM|4.0|I loved the original and this was a good sequel, especially to see what happened to IP Man next. I didn't think it was quite up to the first, especially with the closing fight sequence. I don't understand why IP Man didn't employ the techniques he used to win that contest earlier in the fight (spoiler: part of it has to do with his opponent's unethical behavior). But that's a small gripe. If you like the first movie (and Donnie Yen), I highly recommend this! This (and the original) are by far the best Donnie Yen movies (and I've seen many of them).
078324228X|4.0|This movie was great.  I showed it to a group of inmates in a local jail.  They enjoyed it.  However, let me warn you, this movie is good and \\"Hurricane\\" was wrongly convicted but in many cases a person charged with a crime is guilty and they want to negotiate the less time as they can for them to spend incarcerated.  There were some parts of the movie that were unbelievable especially the parts about the prison life, but the story does make a good movie.  The part that really intrigued me was the fact that the court system does not seem to be about getting to the truth.  I believe this is exactly the way the system works today.
B003F3NEBG|4.0|This adaptation is great, it does a great job of following the story of the book with few omissions and the casting is well done. Colin Firth does a great job of being Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle is a fantastic Elizabeth. From the faithful adaptation of the classic novel to the beautiful scenery in the miniseries, definitely a must see, for any history buff or Jane Austen fan.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Drop the price of the Kindle version to less than that of the hard copy versions and I'll buy it. Till then, no thanks.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This is a great album.  Individual songs are nice, but as a full album it is even stronger.  Many tracks are more than just songs; they're full-on compositions.  Hell, some moments are reminiscent of Maria Schneider (though I imagine the cross-over of listeners here is pretty slim).  The arranging and mixing are really top notch and a pleasant surprise.      I was never that hot \\"for Emma,\\" but this is totally different.  It isn't straight-up, sad-sack indie rock, so folks looking for that may be disappointed.  Also, anyone averse to music that sounds remotely 80's will be horrified by the last track.  However, if you have a thing for rich, layered soundscapes and don't mind having lyrics that are hard to understand, I think you'll like this quite a lot.  It's the kind of music you'll want to listen to with nice speakers or headphones, or as I've found, while in the car parked in a field full of chorusing frogs and blinking fireflies.  Cheesy, I know, but true.
B00569LSUG|5.0|Just listened to clips of this band, after reading a recommendation of them in the music edition of 944 magazine.  I'm so glad I decided to check them out.  This band is just spectacular.  Being a huge fan of moody alternative (Porcupine Tree, OSI, Broken Bells - you get the idea), this band is definitely one to be added to my \\"faves\\" list.  I'm just about to download the entire album, and know I will greatly enjoy it many times over.  Lovely!!
B0042TV4IC|4.0|Anyone who buys the Lark Rise to Candleford Series needs to know if you buy it in the download form it is missing scenes. I have watched both the download for and DVD form and found out there are many scenes missing. They are still good but not as good as buying the DVDS themselves.
B004SBQAL0|5.0|I enjoyed the first book and am looking forward to the next one out.  I think a year between books is a bit long especially when there are six books planned.  I hope the wait is worth it.
B002ULSE5U|5.0|I love this dvd!!!  It covers a complete concert with added extras like back stage antics of the band and more.  A plus for me was that you can turn on the captions and sing along every word with Metallica.  You just have to make sure and go to the menu settings to put the captions in English, the default setting is in Japanese.
B000QKUX56|5.0|I have nothing but great things to say about this film! It is my favorite movie of all time, and I am picky about movies!   It has a fantastic mix of eroticism, humor, sensuality, romance, depth and intrigue. You never know what will happen next. You are always kept wondering. The peformers are fabulous, especially the two leads: Spader and Gyllenhaal! This movie has everything I ever look for in a film and more!!! It is a MUST MUST see!
B0000042H4|5.0|We are opera novices so we relied heavily on other people's reviews of these recordings.  We recently saw a production of the first two operas in the ring cycle and wanted to buy CDs.  We've only played the first 6 discs so far and we absolutely love the performances and the quality or the recordings.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I very rarely pay to go to the theatre- never in my life have I paid to see a movie 3 times, until this one.. I would rather my teenagers fill thier mind with something as this than the majority of what's out there! The best part about it, is this is how Bethany really handled what she went through. If you want to be truly inspired.. this movie is a MUST see.. no need to waste time on reading comments- check it out for yourself!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is the best out there, by far. I once had a Logitech remake and it was garbage. The buttons did not feel natural, the wireless was spotty, and the battery life diminished quickly. I have had none of these problems with this Sony controller.     I initially bought it because my first one died so I could not play at all. When I got this one, my other started working again and now me and my brother can play, which is awesome.    Buy this controller because after all, Sony makes the PS3 too.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This book is for anyone who likes a love story even if the book is about fantastical creatures.     However, unlike most of the fantasy books I've read, the descriptions are not balanced by enough action, and the action that exists is often hurried. But, I enjoyed it enough to read book 2.

Then she gets framed for her sister's murder and is locked up in an insane asylum where she's given an illegal lobotomy to keep her quiet.   If you think this is \\"fun\\" and \\"entertaining\\" then I feel sorry for you.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I rarely write reviews but this book was amazing. It was very well researched and well written.  I read it in about 1.5 days and would pick it up at every spare moment I had. Fascinating topic and great author.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I love his style of music, he has played for years with the Band From TV, but this is his first solo album. IF you like dixieland jazz or just St. Louis blues you will love this work of art. He is a super piano player and his voice was made for this type of music. No Sinatra, but he will do.
0316776963|3.0|This was a selection by our local Book Club.  I hated it in the beginning, but liked it better toward the end.  Others loved the beginning and didn't like the end.  It's not a \\"book\\", it's a series of essays written at different stages of the author's life.  They're not connected, they have no continuity (except for being written by the same man)so it's a little like reading \\"Reader's Digest\\" with different short stories.  I feel led to say that some in our group absolutely LOVE David Sedaris.  I doubt if I would buy another of his books but reserve the right to change my mind (which I'm sure he would endorse in his warped, strange sense of humor.)
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I ordered HBO as soon as I heard they were considering making Game of Thrones 2 years ago, and it was worth every penny.<br />Great job HBO, this is one of the best shows on TV.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 2.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I'm no Hollywood writer but I'm pretty sure this movie had no plot. The shark was thoroughly jumped with this one. Big time. I won't even address the totally unnecessary scene in which Aidan reappears and he and Carrie are tempted to start up again. I literally verbalized the fact that it makes no sense that a man who was absolutely shattered when Carrie cheated on him, would cheat when he has a wife and child on the other side of the world.<br /><br />The nanny plot with Charlotte was also a total snoozer. Samantha has to be headlong into menopause by now but she's still acting like a Girls Gone Wild participant. Miranda was pretty consistent and was the only one who didn't completely get on my nerves.<br /><br />Anyway, there are 6 pages of 1 star reviews and all I can do is high-five everyone who has written one. They should have left well enough alone with the first movie.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|Battle: L.A. is a simple old school John Wayne style war movie. Heaping scorn on this solid, action packed film is like complaining Glee isn't like Phantom of the Opera. This is Saturday afternoon popcorn entertainment:decent acting, good special effects, linear plot, happy ending. A \\"Good Guys versus Bad Guys\\" story, the tough, patriotic Marines square off against invading aliens who are bulk goons fit only to catch a righteous bullet after menacing the innocent civilians. What's the problem?<br /><br />I'll be adding this to my DVD collection.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|OK I read this book about a week ago and re-read it about three days ago! I can not get Trav and Abby (Pigeon) out of my head. From the very start they both had a connection and spark, although not willingly on Abby's part, that was unbreakable. You feel All giddy and actually have butterflies as your reading the story. Like Mad Dog Maddox could actually be a real person (sigh). With no shortage of fighting, sexy people and alpha male attitudes this book is impossible to put down! Kudos to Ms. McGuire!
B000LYGIBU|5.0|Renegade is a very musically diverse album from the borderline metal Angel Of Death with it's eerie keyboard intro solo, to the jazzy track Fats. Some Thin Lizzy classics to come from this album in my opinion include Angel Of Death, Renegade, The Pressure Will Blow, and Hollywood. Those tracks alone should have been enough to gather at least a 3 star review from the \\"professional critics\\". If you read the review on AllMusisGuide, you will see a \\"critic\\" stating how the title track fails to \\"tug on the heart strings\\". That struck me as rather odd, as Renegade was as heavy as Lizzy could get before Thunder and Lightning. If any track on this album is meant to tug on the heart strings, it's It's Getting Dangerous. Here's some lyrics from the song.<br /><br />\\"I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then<br />But now we're all grown up and we're strangers<br />You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped<br />Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers.\\"<br /><br />This was the second Thin Lizzy album I've ever listened to in full, and loved it. Fats and Mexican Blood are the only real detours if you're looking for straight up hard rock. Fats as I said above, is a jazzy track, with a great flow that is  Would have been great on one of Phils solo albums as well as Mexican Blood, a more Spanish sounding ballad then Mexican, but I really don't care as I enjoy the song. Brian Downey, one of rocks most underrated drummers is as solid as ever, and truly shines on Angel of Death and the title track. Give Renegade a few listens and and judge for yourself. Don't listen to critics.  Who cares if it's not the classic \\"Thin Lizzy sound\\", it's still a great album. 5/5 from me.<br /><br />If you get this on CD, DO NOT GET THE WOUNDED BIRD REISSUE. Some of the worst crap I've heard in my life. Muddy sound with lost dynamics.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I saw this movie in 3D and the visuals were beautiful. It had a lot of great action sequences and special effects. An Aircraft test pilot named Hal Jordan is chosen by a ring of Guardian of the Universe Abin Sur to become a new Green Lantern. With the ring, he can fly and create anything with his mind to protect people. Soon, an evil and powerful being called Parallax threatens the world, and it's up to Hal to stop it. I would definitely recommend GREEN LANTERN!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I got this when it was given out for free and was expecting it to be fixed. I have the HTC Incredible, and as far as I know the Amazon App Store says it is compatible but it doesn't work. It goes to the loading screen and then returns to my homepage on my phone. Why does it still do this?
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good storyline with the essential subplots and main and minor characters.  Looking forward the the second book in the series.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|This movie was a tiny bit better than I was expected. It's like a watered down Stephen King story. The monster/alien was pretty cool looking. It's big reveal was similar to that of Jaws, they didn't show it until the middle of the movie. In the early 80's, a few friends are making a zombie movie with a Super 8 mm camera. When a train derails, an alien breaks loose and creates havoc on the town. I'd probably recommend SUPER 8!!!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, right before bed.  Then I was up almost all night thinking about what I'm doing wrong in marketing.  I, like most writers, have no experience marketing.  But this book was so simple, showing me things I inherently should know but don't.  Great job, John!  And thank you!
0312360258|5.0|LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!! This series is awsome and loved reading a story that was so hard to put down!!!
B000FBJG04|4.0|Having watched the mini-series on TV, I was drawn to purchase and read this book.  I enjoyed the book even more because I could put a face to a name, a place to the many conflicts encountered, and, hear the sounds and visualize the words.  It's a military book from whcih one receives an appreciation of how horrible war is, the unbelievable sacrifices that are made, the sometimes miscalculations of those who plan and lead the war effort at a higher level, and, the incredible bravery of those who are on the front lines.  An amazing story from the beginning to the end and that is why the title so appropriately fits, a Band of Brothers.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|kids loved it

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is the best protector I've had for my iPhone yet. I had another phone protector that was sturdy, but limited my access to the charging port--to recharge, I had to partially removed the protector. Ditto for putting headphones in. This one has no problems like that--it's easy to access everything I need to. I'll also add that the screen cover--the third I've tried--is also the best so far. I've had this on for over a month and it still looks great, and has protected my phone from a few hard knocks. Can't ask much more than that.
030745455X|5.0|This is the best Trilogy Crime novel I have read by far.  There are so many pieces to the puzzle and why the main character displays such an indifferent temperament. I ordered the 3rd part to this trilogy.  I have watched the movies (with American sub titles).  Puts the story in perspective.  There is a real message there about women being abused by a system that is meant to protect them.  Good read!!!!!

B004WJRF6C|4.0|I'd forgotten what a charming record this is. It's been a while. Listening to it in an absolutely sterling remaster, its pleasures present themselves unabashedly and without pretension. He isn't trying to do anything but make a fresh start. In the process you can hear preambles to ambient music, the new folk movement, and precursors to Fireman efforts of this century.<br />No point in rehashing each tune. You know them. The bonus CD offers some outtakes, nothing essential. More than one commentator has said this comes across almost like demos, and for those of us who remember the bootleg versions of what later became Let It Be, that's an accurate take on the tunes. After all this time, this sounds and stands up better than ever and is all the more of the moment for exactly that reason. Given the overproduced hatchet job Phil Spector made of both Let It Be and All Things Must Pass, this record clearly stood apart and set off on its own merits.<br />If you haven't listened in a while, do so now. You'll genuinely enjoy it. Great piece of work.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I was interested from the start after hearing that there will be a retelling of the T.V. series. This movie takes the Evangelion franchise to the next level with bold new visuals, detailed storytelling and fresh new takes on the characters that Eva the premier anime title since the mid 90's. I can't wait for the next one!
B004WJREMW|2.0|It isn't that this record is without merit, but it sounds as thin and reedy as Neil Young's TRANS, and that's not a good thing. It also sounds as though Mccartney slapped this together in the rec-room based on the techno-pop that was hitting the air waves back then, but OMD he is not. Oddly, the second disc has more merit than the official release. The live version of Coming Up is a marked improvement over his solo shot at it. Waterfalls and One of These Days are lovely tunes, and Blue Sway might be the 2nd best tune on the discs. Most of the rest on both CDs sounds tinny, the musical ideas do not develop (I'd like to hear Secret Friend with a real band and edited as it seems to have a terrific Latin inflection). I don't like Christmas tunes much, but his holiday song here is better than most of the rest of the music.  There isn't much to say about the arrangements. It all sounds like one-offs. It's not as bad a record as Red Rose Speedway or Wild Life or Broad Street or Press to Play, but just about.   McCartney seemed to be a hit or miss character (too much pot?) until Flowers In The Dirt. This record straddled a time when Wings had folded, Pipes of Peace and Tug of War were still ahead. And with Flowers, Mac seemed to have come back into himself. Since that record he has gone on quite a streak of impressive work.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I read the book in one sitting and although I had been doing much of what John suggests here, there are a few nuggets I had missed. My books were already doing very well, but mainly in The U.K. Since I started working this system only two days ago (and I am not done with my plan), I have noticed a nice increase in sales happening State side. The best $5.00 I have ever spent on how to market books and position myself as an author.<br /><br />Kudos to John Locke and Thank You!<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Michele Scott<br />[...]<br />[...]
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great game. Inventive and intricate enough to be fun but not very difficult to beat. Playing it through a second time.
B004XCUEU2|3.0|First, let me say that the Foo Fighters ARE the greatest band in the world.  I've followed them from the beginning, I own every CD they've ever releasd and I saw this documentary on VH1 the night it premiered.  It only left me wanting more and couldn't wait until it was released on DVD.  The day I saw it listed, I purchased it.  The DVD was in my player within 5 minutes of its delivery.  I scanned the back of the DVD and the listed running time was 140 minutes, which meant I could expect at least another 30 or 40 minutes of material not shown in the VH1 version.  The further I got into the movie, the more I had a sneaking suspicion that I was watching exactly the same thing as I watched on VH1, minus commercials and explanatives.  It ran exactly 100 minutes.  I immediately looked at the product description page and it also stated a running time of 140 mins.  I made a complaint and without any hassle what so ever, received a replacement.  Like deja vu, I ran to my DVD player, stuck it in and...once again...100 mins.  I'm extremely disappointed.  The \\"Bonus Material is OK but there really isn't anything to see that you haven't seen in the VH1 version.  I gave this movie three stars because it is a great documentary about a great rock band, but the decieving running time and lack of additional material kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.  I'm glad I can add it to my Foo Fighter collection but if, like me, you recorded the VH1 version on your DVR, there really isn't anything else to see. This obvious error should be corrected immediately because it is deceiving.  Bottom line:  1:40 does not equal 140 minutes, it only equals 100.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. I found them just by searching \\"best sellers\\" on Amazon, read a couple reviews and decided to get them. I was definitely not disappointed. They are very well written and have that lasting power where you just have to keep reading them, no matter the time of night. I am a fan of Hunger Games and other fantasies, so these books were right up my alley. I will be recommending these to all of my friends..
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game, can play for hours. It is fun, creative, &amp; keeps me entertained the entire time. I have to force myself to put it down! It&apos;s a great game for all ages. I&apos;ve gotten my 5 yr old nephew addicted as well as his dad!
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I caught the end of the VH-1 special and then found it online and proceeded to watch it over & over & over. When the DVD came out, I knew I had to have it and what a great buy it was. It's nice to see amazing musicians in their \\"element\\" but yet are normal guys. So many musicians turn in to jerks with huge inflated egos but not these guys. Also, Dave was smart by keeping footage from the beginning because before this documentary, I only knew bits and pieces of the Foo Fighters and how they got where they are today. I also LOVED the extra footage, particularly \\"Taylor's Cymbals\\" and I'll say no more other than I thought I would pi** myself from laughing so hard. This documentary is truly a gem and I will never get bored watching it over and over.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|What a disappointment. With such an interesting start and premise, the story degenerated into a self-indulgent farce. One ridiculous development after another- like the author was throwing darts at a plot. Kept waiting for coherence but it continued to spin out of reality. Thrilled to have it end and am glad to report it was utterly stupid to the finish.
0316174483|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books for children. Its a great gift for children with a multi color ink pad. I work at a childrens hospital and I have extra copies that I lend to the patients. We have done cards, posters and decorated a book case for the teacher with each childs name and selected a funprint that best represented the child.
B000RF7XYO|1.0|This portrayal of Elizabeth was on a par with the second season of Blackadder, but not quite so good. On the other hand, Hollywood is not in the business of teaching history to the great unwashed, so historical atrocities like this and Braveheart are sure Oscar winners, provided they are sufficiently cheesy, sleazy, violent, loud, and artsy. Pecuniae vindice.
B002VECMAO|2.0|By itself, the movie is not too bad. It has funny parts, though much of it seems too surreal to be true . . . even thought it is. This is the movie's fatal flaw - they fictionalized a story that was already outlandish and true. By combining people into one character, changing story lines, and rewriting history, they made a great book into a mediocre movie.<br /><br />In short, SKIP THE MOVIE, GET THE BOOK. My review of the book is below:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439181772 The Men Who Stare at Goats]] is really, really funny, mostly because it is true. I read [[ASIN:1594488010 The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry]] and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to get Ronson's other books. This is a book that is really hard to define . . . in fact, when I looked for it in a bookstore I couldn't find it anywhere. Finally I asked someone, and they directed me to the New Age section (definitely not a new age book . . . would be more appropriate under history, military history, or even politics).<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book is about some of the insane things that our government and military have sponsored and paid for over the years. At times it is a riot, and at other times it manages to be profoundly sad. The real atrocities that take place are juxtaposed with the ridiculous, and it puts everything into a different perspective. This book skips around between different themes and timelines, but here is run down of what to expect:<br /><br />The story of the FBI and CIA flying in a Russian psychic to subliminally influence David Koresh in Waco.<br /><br />The story of the military sponsored document that outlines New Earth Battalion procedures, such as carrying lambs into combat and speakers that play soothing music worn on soldier's necks. You can also find this on Amazon now - [[ASIN:1449524559 First Earth Battalion Operations Manual: Reprint of Original Manual from the 70's]].<br /><br />The story of a army psychic spy who stopped the heart of a goat by staring at it.<br /><br />The government recruitment of a dance instructor from Florida who now practices staring at hampsters.<br /><br />The sad backstory behind the Hale-Bopp comet cult, and how a former government agent who taught remote viewing classes was connected to it.<br /><br />And much more. Many of the stories are insane and ridiculous, but also ring true. Whether they really happened or not is hard to say, but there are certainly people high up in the military and government who believe they happened. This is a better read than most fiction books, and if it was not backed up by real sources and documents would be classified as science fiction. Read it for entertainment purposes and to see how a great journalist and author can turn facts into political satire, humor, and a great read. Highly Recommended (the book, not really the movie!)nt of a dance instructor from Florida who now practices staring at hampsters.

B000ICLRHK|3.0|This aged just a bit better than I'd remembered, although admittedly I didn't have the fondest recollections of it. In essence it's a nonstop barrage of action clich&eacute;s that doesn't try to step out of its own way, choosing instead to embrace the stereotypes and come up with a few new ones along the way. Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration. Dennis Hopper is noteworthy as the preposterously over-the-top mad bomber; he serves up several great lines that sent me backwards through decades' worth of pop culture nostalgia.
B0037BB00I|5.0|Adele is the true definition of an Artist.  I think too many people with microphones and mediocre voices are allowed to say they are artist.  No they are performers but Adele is a true Artist.  She is truly a crossover artist.  Anyone listening to her songs can feel the soulfulness of her musicality.  She is simply fabulous.
B004XQO8VO|2.0|One of a series of strange stabs in the dark for Sylvester Stallone's career in the mid '90s, Demolition Man struggles at times to find a consistent middle ground between mind-numb action and culture-conscious sarcastic comedy. Its tongue-in-cheek predictions for the state of society in the year 2032 are so genuinely stupid that I felt like an idiot for laughing, but laugh I did - and often. These punchlines are plainly lowbrow, such a direct contrast to the straight manner in which Stallone plays his leading role that I wasn't entirely sure everyone on the cast was in on the joke. The plot, too, is unfailingly moronic, even by action film standards, and may have benefitted from a more distant date stamp. When the opening scene designates Los Angeles in 1996 as a criminal's safe haven, complete with a flame-licked Hollywood sign, you should know you're in for a long ride - and it only gets rockier from there. Wesley Snipes plays a joyously schizophrenic foil, part Joker and part Batman, but the picture never advances far enough beyond its one-note premise to really take advantage of it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|As far as RTS games go, this one is great considering it is made for touch screen mobile device. Hours of fun to be had, with unlockables, as you advance.
0316044695|5.0|Facts about this terrible situation presented from a very personal view focussing on the courage of a young man's fellow seals. I walked away from this story with an increased respect for these young men who serve, and ironically, for the peoples in a country for which which we know little, and respect even less. Created a heated discussion in my local book club!
0470901071|1.0|I bought this book because everybody was raving about how Lammle really explained things on an easy way. I was very disappointed and not only in the extremely bad quality of the paper. Lammle only talks about the stuff you need to know without really explaining them. I have read certain parts several times without ever finding out what he's talking about. I bought the 4 books from cisco for the ICND1 and ICND2 exams and had many AHA! moments that I never found in Lammle's books. Save yourself the money and buy the Cisco books.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|Black Swan is one of those movies that will leave you appreciating it and liking it for what it is, but not enough to make you feel that you truly loved it. The main problem with this movie for me is that there isn't much of a story and virtually no character development. All of the characters are one-dimensional. And let's face it, there isn't much of a plot or storyline here. The only thing that I got from this movie is that the main character is obviously unstable and is a bit of a child woman whose role in Swan Lake compels her to challenge herself to bring out her dark side, kind of like art imitating life. I thought the way the tale of Swan Lake juxtaposed rather well with that of Nina was very clever, but like I said, it's so shallow and one-dimensional. This movie could have done with a couple of flashbacks to help establish WHY Nina is unstable. We never know why. A lot more could have been done between the mother/daughter relationship, but they do nothing with it other than showing that mother and daughter obviously have a dysfunctional relationship. Why, we never know. I didn't mind the eroticism so much, but it was done in such a gimmicky, contrived way for me to really take seriously. It didn't add to the story; they seemed more of a distraction. All the time they put into the eroticism and the CGI stuff with Nina could have been spent in fleshing out the characters more (especially with Winona Rider's character...a lot could have been done with that as well, instead, all that's delivered with this character is violence and bitterness). Overall, I like this movie, and I appreciate it, but I wished there could have been more depth in the characters and in the story. Natalie Portman however definitely didn't fail to disappoint.
B00008PW2D|2.0|This season was sooo boring and dragged and was just pointless. I could have skipped this season and just went on to season 6 without being lost!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I wish the studio released this version over the current theatrical copy. The added scenes not only answered a myriad of questions but brought true continuity to the film. It was worth the extra time out of our soooo busy pitiful lives! I will sell my theatrical version to the first sucker I find! I still believe that the true history is film worthy vs the changes like the final lovers escape (she never left Guy and Balien had a wife and kids in Jerusalem) and the sword fight w/ Guy and Balien impossible because Guy was in prison in Damascus when the seige happened months after Hattin! Balien was vassel to his BROTHER in Ibelin and Nabulus and fought as rearguard w/ Raymond(Tiberius) @ Hattin. Still, a great film especially in Blue Ray and the full director's cut. Hollywood moguls, believe in the audience's intellegence rather than the $10 you get for a seat in the theater!
B000002GVO|5.0|5/5. It took the Eagles just 5 years to make a long way from Western outlaws to Los Angeles life experts. The best seller album featuring one of the most recognizable tunes of all times is a deeply conceptual piece of work showcasing the best and worst tendencies of Californian life of the time. With the departure of Bernie Leadon, the Eagles have left their bluegrass and country-rock roots behind (with the only exception of \\"New Kid In Town\\") going into the territory of harder rock with the addition of guitarist Joe Walsh, whose broken riffs are particularly audible on \\"Life In the Fast Lane\\", \\"Victim of Love\\" and second solo of \\"Hotel California\\". What started as Don Felder's Mexican reggae on a demo tape was soon to become the major international hit that most people around the world associate with the Eagles. With a Spanish notes throughout the tune, guitar interplay between Joe Walsh and Don Felder and an eerie second of silence right before the beginning of the second verse the track is a bizarre mix of musical influences. Lyrically, this might be the most intelligent song ever written, epitomizing the underbelly of success and American dream, the excess of American culture and darker side of the paradise that California was thought by many to be. The same topics are further explored throughout the album, most notably in \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", a song about a couple who had everything but lost it because of their lifestyle, drugs and alcohol abuse and bad decisions. Hotel California is also an album which features the most melodic songs ever composed by Joe Walsh (piano-based \\"Pretty Maids All In a Row\\", a melancholic reflection on heroes that come and go) and Randy Meisner (the optimistic \\"Try and Love Again\\").   The entire album is a complete gem, starting with artwork and one of the most romantic album covers in the music industry to perfect arrangement and production of every song. Five out of nine tracks are sung by Don Henley and all showcase his vocaland song-writing talent, especially on \\"The Last Resort\\" - the biggest piece of musical literature telling of how people destroy everything they find good by their presence. The piano-based epic sums up the meaning of the album as people mortgaging their future for gain and greed. \\"You call some place Paradise ... kiss it goodbye.\\" Definitely one of the greatest conceptual albums of all times. -Sain Alizada
B004G600A4|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen such a heart warming story. The characters expressions were fabulous and conveyed real feeling.
1586487981|5.0|An excellent book by Abhijit and Esther. They walk us through some of the important debates on poverty and provide a lot of insights on ways to address these concerns. They are not dogmatic and make an active effort to know what works at the local level. They recognize the limits of their methods. However, they maintain that the focus on micro-issues is important to prepare a pool of reliable information to address wider systemic challenges. Some of the negative reviews that I have read here seem to be from appraisers who seem to be confused about the purpose of the book. I learned a lot from it. So if you are a person who is interested in poverty related issues and is not ideologically bound to the extreme positions that Sachs and Easterly take, you would enjoy this book. Highly recommended.
1597801585|4.0|While much of sci-fi deals with hard, metallic, bleeping technologies, the genre occasionally ventures into organic-based techologies. These are usually idealized in utopian, peace-loving societies with a synergy between all the organisms and a Gaia temple in the middle of it all with nubile young priestesses of great wisdom tending a sacred grove or something.<br /><br />Mr. Bacigalupi took the idea of a post-petroleum world that switched to biological-based technologies and applied real-world motivations and a(n  un)healthy dose of worst-case scenarios. The result is a richly imagined dystopian future of ecological collapse. While other authors tend to fall into the genre trap of painting ecological collapse with a barren world, Mr. Bacigulpi paints his picture in the tropics with emergent, but invasive, life forms and ever-threatening disease and plague, both natural and man-made.<br /><br />The author's dark future with quick cuts and incompletely developed characters has a definite William Gibson feel to it. Like Gibson's stories, all the characters are distant, both from each other and the reader. As such, readers who prefer a more emotional impact in their stories may find the story lacking and the plot a bit thin.<br /><br />The story itself is maybe only 3 stars, but as an act of imagination and creation, it gets 4 stars.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|If you listened to almost any of the good rock bands of the 60' and 70's and you don't know who Robert Johnson is; you owe it to yourself to find out. The first time I heard Robert Johnson I said, to myself, \\"Dang! Sounds like Robert Plant recorded with just an accoustic guitar.\\"    Then I started to realize that at least half the bands that really MATTERED had copied or re-worked songs which RJ had recorded back before WWII.  The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Cream and every band that Eric Clapton was in, Jimi Hendrix, and on and on.     This is a collection of ALL his recordings, re-mastered, slowed down to real time, the best recordings possible of Robert Johnson, THE MAN, THE LEGEND, The white hot  shooting star of the Delta Blues.      A little trivia, RJ lived to be 27, Jimi Hendrix Lived to be 27, both of them died under suspiscious circumstances. Is there a third one coming? 3 x 3 = 27.
B001EIOOWC|4.0|I enjoyed this, and for a high action it was very enjoyable to watch, thought the actors well played their parts well.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|How could the Kindle price exceed the paperback price?  Tell the publisher to drop the price below what I pay for the paperback and I will order the set.  What were they thinking?
B000XA5K4I|4.0|I agree with the title as it is just what happened, the action was varied and very swift, very entertaining higly recommend.
B002VECM72|5.0|What a wonderful story! This one anybody can see. It was based on a true story.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not so mush a review as a comment. Love Angry Birds so its just more levels to play and beat.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|We just got this and my 3 1/2 year old loves it. It is easy enough for him to operate and he is self-sufficient with it. Sometimes the door latches (2 per door, 4 total) are a bit hard for him to snap/unsnap but that's the only difficulty he has. The case seems sturdy and durable.<br /><br />There are 2 independent doors that swing down to become the exit ramps. Each has a spring loaded launcher that is cocked by pulling back the levers on the top of the case. The 2 gray buttons release the launchers, which propel the two sets of cars. So depending on how simultaneously the buttons are pressed one set inevitably launches first. You can use one side at a time as well, leaving the other side closed. Each lane/bay has the flag and number of the associated World Grand Prix car from the movie. As mentioned before, it does not work with cars that are too narrow - the wheels will not straddle the rectangular cutouts in the case and the cars will not launch properly. But for the 1:55 cars and standard Hot Wheels it works fine.<br /><br />The cars are pushed surprisingly far if on a smooth hard floor, with occasional spin outs. Some other reviewers has issues with the strength of the launchers, but our Cars go 15+ feet on tile. Cars with the synthetic rubber tires don't go as far as the ones with plastic tires.<br /><br />When closed up as a case the cars have room to rattle and turn, and do require repositioning when reopened.  But the latches are secure; if closed properly there is no way for cars to accidentally dump out.<br /><br />Overall a bit pricy for a case but it's much more than a case and well worth it for hours of unattended play. It's nice that you don't need any additional track or parts, just a smooth floor.
0312330855|5.0|My son was not a reader, but this book peaked his interest many years ago, and he loved it.  I was telling his 11-year-old son the story, and he wanted to read it.  I hope he will enjoy it just as much as his Dad.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Preface: Apparently there are several versions of DONNIE DARKO floating around. I watched The Director's Cut, true--but it was a Net flix version all on a single DVD.<br /><br />I must have been well bolted down in my coffin when this movie was first released because it went completely under the radar. I had seen Jake Gyllenhaal in 2 later films & I thought he was a really good actor. So, I was finding out a little more about him & sort of stumbled on DONNIE DARKO. The film, of course, is fantastic (both literally & figuratively), but I can't help but wonder what it would have been like without JG in it. I felt the same way about AND THEN THERE WILL BE BLOOD with the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfection itself in the leading role. And those eyes! As ambiguous & mystifying as the character he plays. KG could well be the equivalent of a Daniel Day-Lewis for his generation.<br /><br />If permitted, I would have given DONNIE DARKO 4 & 1/2 stars. In the end I witheld a star because I felt there were a few cliches in the film. The \\"overweight\\" girl & the gym instructor seemed a bit sterotypical. The girl's graceful dance could have been lifted from a TV TWILIGHT ZONE episode where the same idea of the plump woman who fantasies being a ballerina is featured in it too. The chief bully was a bit over the top as well--I mean, snorting coke by the student's lockers--give us a break!<br /><br />Then there's the scene where Donnie's therapist tells him that she has only been giving placebos. If not outright illegal, in the real world it would definitely be seen as the height of unprofessionalism...not to mention dangerous. I suppose it can be chalked up to another one of the ambiguous & ambivalent themes that run throughout the movie.<br /><br />Other than the above, I was very excited by DONNIE DARKO, primarily because it visualized aspects of the Parallel Universe theories that have popped up in the scientific explorations of quantum mechanics. One theory promotes that idea that every possibility of our physical reality plays out with every possibility of outcome on each level. There's a certain element of Nietzche's \\"Eternal Recurrence\\" in these rather mind-bending concepts as well.<br /><br />Any work of art (especially an American film) that generates the interest & cult-following (true, largely fostered by the \\"official website\\") has got to have something real going for it. I watched the movie twice in a row & twice the second day. To turn a phrase of Leonard Cohen (\\"Democracy is coming to the USA\\"), maybe appreciation for surrealism is finally coming to the USA.ibility of our physical reality plays out with every possibility of outcome on each level.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Having loved the books this series is based on for years, I've long dreamt of a movie or TV-series adaptation, but never really thought it possible. Now it's here and it's better than anything I could have dreamt of. It stays very true to the books whilst still being a great TV-series in its own right. Game of Thrones is an incredibly detailed and gritty take on the fantasy genre, with a staggering number of complex and memorable characters. I now have complete confidence in the creators' understanding and love for the books, and I'm very much looking forward to the second season. Warmly recommended to veterans and newbies alike!
0762434279|1.0|I had intended to buy the unabridged version of this book. I had no idea there was a 'miniature version'.  Amazon included the link to the miniature version along with the links to the full version, which I think was inappropriate. Unless you are watching carefully (I wasn't!) you might not notice that you are buying the miniature version until after it arrives. The mini version is about 1 inch by 1 inch and does a terrible job of capturing the content of the full book. Worthless.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This film is really two films in one. The first film (reality) is about young women in a gothic type mental institution being abused and trying to escape. The second film (based in Babydoll's imagination) comes in widely varied heavy doses of action as follows:<br /><br />- Samurai Fight Scene<br />- Steam Punk WWI Fight Scene<br />- Lord of the Rings Dragon Fight Scene<br />- Futuristic iRobot Train Fight Scene<br /><br />The second film has all the traits of a Matrix action flick, but with mainly ladies instead of Neo and Morpheus.<br /><br />This film is loaded with action, with a thin veil for a storyline. The main idea is that you can set your mind free, even if your body is confined.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I was skepitcal even with all the positive reviews of the FiiO E5 headphone amp.  But it really does work, and it's money well spent for what it is.  It's small and easy to use, and it really does improve the sound quality, from my cell phone, and my laptop.  It's not just making it \\"louder\\" but rounds out the sound, brings in more details that was lost without it.  I'm no expert on this stuff, but for me, it's money well spent hooked up to my Klipsch S4s and Sony MDR-EX310LP, can't wait to hook them up to a higher quality set soon.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Do you want a strictly believable story line? Go watch a documentary then!    The acting and music are very good.  The blending of diverse styles of music when the rock concert and the classical cello were playing together ties in with a universal language theme running through the movie.  Intense in places but not too scary or melodramatic.  Shades of Oliver Twist.  Sad at times, but with a happy ending.
0812550706|3.0|I've seen this book referred to as a \\"military-academy Harry Potter,\\" but I don't really see the comparison. Ender gets accepted to Battle School and it's no Hogwarts with magic, butterbeer and quidditch. Its military boot camp in space with grueling hours, exhaustive exercising, and constant wargaming where the future of the human race depends on how well you play. Almost every situation in Ender's life is deliberately made worse so that he can learn to think and fend for himself.Not to mention Ender is always picked on for being a \\"Third\\"....a third child is extremely rare in this future setting,but Ender's birth was authorized by the government. He seems to be Earths only hope against an alien race. Did I mention this kid is only six, and by the end of the book he's only twelve?<br /><br />I love that Ender is a peaceful character forced to make difficult decisions and yet he still maintains his humanity. I love that Ender doesn't even seem like a child, yet we are constantly reminded of his frailty. I love how he is constantly worried he is turning into his brother Peter (who is a freakin' psychopath) and he totally isn't. I love his sweet relationship with his sister, and his immense compassion and empathy. Even when the odds are stacked against him he manages to shine.<br /><br />Despite the immense pressure all the children were put through and some of the violence Ender had to deal with, I liked the story. It's obvious that Mr.Card has an interest in military science. I found myself interested in the battle-simulations and strategy Ender used. I always wondered why Ender's Game has such a huge following within the military. Now I know it's supposed to teach critical thinking. So if you like the idea of reading cool battle strategies and don't want to read Bruce Catton's three-volume Army of the Potomac then by all means read this.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Well, i won't write a long drawn out review, I own the dvd collection and decided to buy it on Blu-ray since i've never seen the Directors cut and special edition versions etc... well worth it and they all look excellent in HD. I use a PS3 and Sharp HDTV for viewing and all the movies look amazing, especially Alien, which is still artistically my favorite of the series.     The packaging is the only area that leaves room for debate, it's nice but the fold out book style while being cool, I'd rather have the traditional little pop-hub spindle type thing to hold them into place, instead you've got basically paper sleeves to slide the discs in and out of and it's hard not to smudge the discs with your fingers etc. No big deal overall though.     Technically i'd give it 4.5 stars, half a star off for the packaging.
0786860707|5.0|I was incredibly pleased with this product. Being an international purchase, I didn't expect it to arrive for quite some time, however it came several weeks earlier than I had anticipated. Not only that but the book was in excellent condition. It's such a huge book with so much information and a very cute hard cover. Definitely well worth the price, I feel like I got such a great bargain.
014241722X|4.0|I picked this up on a whim for $6 at Walmart. Along the lines of Harry Potter, this is a series intended for young readers that adults can enjoy as well. As a serious reader of modern fiction, it's nice to take a break from thick 500+ page novels and read a double spaced 250 page book.  I actually had more fun with this book than some of his main works.  It's a modern day Hardy Boys type series with one main charater, Theodore Boone, a thirteen year-old fascinated with the law, whose parents are both lawyers. A very simple and fun read.    My only caveat is the way Grisham gratuitously and incessantly pushes his personal politcial viewpoint into the book, just as he does in his \\"adult\\" works.  He's a far left liberal in my view, but I would be just as annoyed if he were pushing an ultra conservative viewpoint - he shouldn't use fictional works as a soapbox, something I find highly intrusive. I'm still a fan of his writing however, since for the most part, his politics do not interfere with the plot.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|The Name of the Wind is a bit windy in length, but it really draws you in quickly and holds you throughout the read.  Focusing on the exploits of a legendary hero in his youngest days, the book is a pleasure to read if you like the concept of the history behind the history, so to speak.  It's a bit long winded at times, but the story always seems to shine no matter how long the read it.  Would recommend to anyone who wants a good change of pace from the normal swords and magic fantasy.
B004B63M1S|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful \\"Grindhouse\\" offering that is so thick with satire that a whole lot of people will not get it and be offended.    If you are too \\"linear\\" to understand grand satiric stereotyping and the lampooning of an overtired message, then this movie is definitely not for you. If you can take it for what it is worth, a serial romp with gratuitous everything, then run to get a copy and be entertained over and over again.    I can see how some people would take the \\"message\\" of this movie to heart in today's political climate, but that is not a Robert Rodriguez thing. Trust me, I live in South Texas and have seen plenty of the \\"serious\\" movies that push illegal immigration. This is not one. Relax and enjoy the carnage.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The second book in the new trilogy wanders a bit more in the narrative than the first one.  The exploits of Kvothe are still an entertaining read, but the book drags on at points.  While we know a bit more about Kvothe and how he became to be a legend, it felt more like a filler novel.  Not much about the overall plot was forwarded, but it was still a very entertaining read.  With how slow the plot developed, it will be interesting to see if the third book picks up in narrative pace, or if it winds up being much larger than the initial planned trilogy.    Make no mistake, the book is a good read.  It just tends to meander away from the path at times.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|I went to an evening performance of this film.  As I waited in line, the 4 pm movie let out. I was greeted with seniors raging about how awful the film was, save your money and go home they shouted at us, waiting in line to go in. I had never experienced this before.  The film was being shown in a suburban 'art house' where the films off the beaten path are shown.   I was hooked from the beginning. The only problem with this film was the people in the movie house who didn't get it and were noisily leaving. One person tentatively shushed a noisy woman exiting \\" what shushed?! there's no dialogue!\\"  I thought, at last, not the same old human condition story where I am desperate for some crumb of light, something to enlighten, to illuminate.  I loved it! the music, the photography!  I remember that barely contained young boy energy!  A group of older boys in our neighborhood used to walk up the hill in front of our house and their pubescent energy was loud, dangerous, wild - cutting through the rhythms of a summer day.  At the end, the audience, of which there were many, applauded.   I would watch this again, many times but not in movie house with all the interruptions of the dumbfounded leaving.
0307712508|3.0|Although I admit that I have not yet finished this book, I am having trouble wrapping my head around its basic premise: that just because Henrietta's cancer cells inexplicably lived forever, her story deserves to be told.  What happened was surely a scientific milestone of epic proportion, but it doesn't make the biography of the person who housed those cells any more compelling or important, in my opinion. If some association between the miracle of the cells and the fact that they came from Henrietta could be established and discussed in the book, I would be fascinated to learn about it.  But with no explanation of causality, I don't see the value of the biographical aspect.  Could that be the reason, as Skloot seems astonished to point out, her story had never before been told?

B0042GNDT8|5.0|All you have to know about these recordings is that they are Strauss tone poems conducted by the great Fritz Reiner.  In my (amateur) opinion, no one does it better.
0307716511|4.0|I'm not going into detail about the plot, since others have done this so well. What I want to emphasize is that this is first-rate story-telling, not so much because of what actually happens (anything that involves medical procedures and gene therapy practically dictates some malevolent intent on someone's part); but rather because of the way Beatrice experiences her investigation into her sister's death, their relationship, and her physical, mental and emotional changes. There's a somewhat unique story-within-a-story framing device, which I found particularly effective, especially as it was brought round at the end and a few nicely drawn characters. Yes, some of the male characters--okay, MOST of the male characters--were almost laughably officious; one notable exception turns out not to count for much at the end. But within the context of Bea's struggle to make herself believed, even this flight of fancy is understandable. For a first novel...for any novel to deliver so precisely the mix of frustration, terror, grief, anxiety and alienation that sudden loss generates is remarkable. And no, I didn't see the ending coming, not entirely and not enough to leave me any alternatives except to read straight through to the completely satisfactory end.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I am a self-published author. Non-fiction, which is not the meat of the book. However, I have walked in his shoes with so-so results even though I had the luxury of  attention from NBC and CNN ...as he said so eloquently \\"..that helps but you need the day to day reader, follower.\\" I learned a ton,TON, from this book. And as John said, the self-published route is not for the weak. He spent $25K but I can top that and not proudly. Everything he says is common sense, not marketing 101 as one person suggested. (you try it, let me know how it works) The biggest lesson is that any success is daily routine, a plan, and execution. It is elementary but there are few who will adhere to it. I more than recommend this book to any writer. And my very best wishes to John Locke for his continued success OUTSIDE the box. You gotta love a guy like that!  Nancy Rossman  [...]
0062060554|3.0|BASED ON ALL THE FAVORABLE REVIEWS, I EXPECTED IT TO BE SO MUCH BETTER.  THE PLOT IDEA WAS VERY INTERESTING, EVEN COMPELLING, BUT OVERALL THE NOVEL WAS DISAPPOINTING AND CONTAINED SOME GLARING ERRORS-WHERE WAS THE EDITOR???
B0052UZIFA|5.0|First things first, this is a HUGE game, 78mb so it will take up a lot of space. That said it is still probably the best game I've played to date on my HTC Evo 4g. It starts easy to allow you time to get used to the strategy, but steadily becomes more challenging. Battery usage is heavy, however that said it is definitely worth it.     IMO the size of a game should not affect the rating of the product itself. It is in the product information tab, so if you don't want the size don't download it.     Mushrooms fo life!!
0691142165|4.0|Interesting commentary on the history of economic turmoil.  It was discussed on a global, regional, national and banking basis.  Inflation, currency, defaults, credit cycles and asset bubbles were included in the narative.  Events were expounded upon such as the 1929 crash and the relatively current subprime crisis.  Different crises indicators were listed, with a short discussion of policy responses.  After reading the book, I have a better understanding of those factors which lead to an economic event and also understand they will continue into the future.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|When I first watched DL I thought -- eh, quirky, funny, but nothing great.  Couple more times and I picked up more and more.  Now I love it:  The look and feel of the film, the panning/train motion motif, the effective use of slo mo, subtle humor, and interesting music.  It helps that I'm obsessed with India and so right off the bat they had me to an extent.  The opening scene with Bill Murray alone is almost worth a rental/purchase.      The plot is nothing spectacular.  For me it's the creative melding of visuals, music, setting, and humor/irony.  The three brothers are pretty flat, as others have said, but isn't that part of the point of the film??!!  They are detached and distant, even in the midst of a place that demands the opposite..    Hotel Chevalier did little for me.  Seemed rather pointless.
0300169787|5.0|This isn't a total history of the genius but does tell quite a bit. It focuses on the ART and has many deep and insightful quotes from the man himself. I was beyond pleased with this and for sooooooo cheap! Hardcover a good size and the cover changes as you move it around how cool!! This really is a book about the art and not a biography as some have criticized it for lacking keep that in mind. ALSO this is about the exhibit in NY your mot going to get every piece from every show. that book needs to be made but got now this is my new obsession.  ONLY PERSONAL COMPLAINT NOT ENOUGH UP CLOSES ON PLATOS ATLANTIS'S McQUEENADILLO SHOES. just the one from bat romance.

0439023513|3.0|I had high hopes for this book as I really enjoyed the first two books in this series. I have to say that I was somewhat let down by this book. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but I really struggled through this book. It wasn't that there wasn't as much action in this book, because there was plenty of action, but this one just seemed predictable in many parts.    The characters just seemed somewhat stagnant in this book as opposed to the other two books. There were a few twists and turns in this book but nothing like the first two. As I said earlier the plot was predictable in parts and boring in other parts.    I don't even have a whole lot to say about it in review of it. It was just ho-hum to me. If you are like me then you are going to have to read the 3rd book because you read the first two, but don't get your hopes up like I did because I don't feel like this book can live up to them.    Overall Rating: 3/5
0307405095|5.0|Martha Stewart's Pies and Tarts book is filled with modern and classic pies and tarts. Whether you're a novice or experienced baker, there is something for everyone to try out.<br /><br />Separated into sections which include 'classic', 'sleek' and 'dreamy'; it covers the ones that everyone knows - Pumpkin Pie, Tarte Tatin to the lesser known Creme Brulee Tartlets and Apple-Brandy Pie. The book also covers the basics - such as equipment and how to make pate brisee. It also has a holiday section including desserts for 4th July or Passover.<br /><br />This would make an excellent gift for any occasion too - a wedding, new home or even just because.<br /><br />It certainly makes your mouth water as you peruse it...
088708155X|3.0|The story is cute and informative.  Eric Carle's stories always are.  But the tiny size of the book was unexepected.  Too small for the second graders I bought it for.

I can't wait for the next book, I was really sad when I read all this (in one night, I could NOT put it down)! This book was the best I've read since Nalini Singh's Kiss of Snow came out :)
B003L77G2Y|5.0|The writers of FRINGE could never be accused of being like everyone else.  If one is waiting for a predictable plot line with this bunch, forget it.  I cannot say anything of this season's end other than I did not see this cliff hanger coming at all.  And I am now waiting anxiously to see what happens in season 4 to resolve it.  However, this show is having a viewing problem since it changed to Friday nights, i.e. it has lost viewers, so we might be stuck with incredible cliff hangers overall if the ratings don't increase.  That would be a shame because this show is destined to be a big overall keeper for years to come, much like STAR TREK and the THE X-FILES.<br /><br />Where this show has gone is to increasingly juxtaposition two worlds against one another.  We have to look no further than old SUPERMAN comics to remember the idea that there is more than one universe, that there are alternate universes, with other versions of ourselves on similar paths but their choices cause significant diversions.  A big part of this third season is that Peter romances the Olivia's of BOTH worlds.  This is important because Peter is the pivot around which the two worlds swing since he was stolen from one world to live in the other.<br /><br />Walter Bishop, Peter's father, is a complete creep in one world as its leader and an eccentric, lovable genius in the other.  The latter role remains my favorite in the whole show.  This is where the humor in the show comes in which is much needed as comic relief.<br /><br />If you haven't watched FRINGE yet, I recommend you watch it straight through on DVD or streaming, the three full seasons in order.  This series will be almost impossible to watch out of order as the central story line advances in strict linear fashion.  Each series also ends with an incredible cliff hanger which will also work against your seeing it out of order.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Well having only discovered the glory of doctor who in January, some friends of mine spoke so highly of it that i decided what the heck I'll watch a few episodes and go from there. From The very first Episode Entitled \\"Rose\\" it took me only three months to Catch all the way up to current running season 6. I was obsessed! I'll be the first to admit i was extremely skeptical of how Matt Smith was going to fill David Tennant's shoes. I am happy to report that Smith has really taken the role and owned every episode of this season. He's really a much more lighthearted and carefree kind of Doctor. Which given the subject matter of Tennant's three season run of quirky first then depressed, on to almost power crazed at times, it is nice to see a less burdened doctor. don't get me wrong that is why the Tenth doctor was so good and the development of those traits is what made me keep watching.  Since we have a new Doctor it is good to see the character having more fun and back to the totally intrigued with everything wonder that makes Who continue.     I was also worried about Amy Pond as a companion. I loved Rose , Martha, and Donna all for there own individual manner of how they view the Doctor. I am happy to report that Karen Gillan's Amy is unique enough to stand out from being a clone of any of the Others. Amy is no pushover she is a fiery scottish gal who had to move to England and therefore really wants to see everywhere but where she grew up. She is tough witty sometimes a little seductive as well. Her Fiance Rory is an on again off again character but i don't wanna give any spoilers lets just say it's not easy being engaged to a doctor's companion especially not for him. In short Amy is awesome as well      Another change was Steven Moffatt taking over as head writer. Moffat wrote pretty much all of the best episodes of the previous 4 seasons. With him taking the reigns as the boss this season is incredibly intricate and interwoven with a constant story arc that at least touches every episode of the season, and practically is imperative to a few others.     Almost every episode of this season is top notch i'd say the weakest of the lot is a late season one called The lodger but it has a lot of really candid doctor moments which make it a nice little break before getting slammed with the intense season finale 2-parter, which is really quite awesome.    Special features are a lot of fun with the Doctor Who confidential episodes all worth watching. and the video diary's are quite fun to watch as well. It's good to see the cast out of character just running around the sets having a grand old time. All in all this is a great addition to any who fanatic's library and if you have not seen this season do yourselves a favor and check it out!
014241543X|5.0|The characters were extremely well developed in this book. It's told entirely from Mia's point of view and we don't get a really good look at her or her family before the accident. Throughout the story, however, are flashbacks of events in Mia's life that were important to her. This really helps us form a connection with not only Mia, but her entire family. We get to see how close she is to everyone and what their relationships were like. Her parents were kind of free spirits, both intensely into music and extremely supportive of their children. The love that Mia had for her mother, father, and younger brother, Teddy, could be felt very easily. The same can be said for the other characters as well, such as her best friend Kim, her boyfriend, Adam, her grandparents. We got to see them dealing with seeing Mia in the hospital post-accident and then bits and pieces of what everything was like before the accident. The author did an excellent job of weaving the characters' stories and making us as readers want to know more about each and every one of them, and their relationships with Mia.    The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly: First, The Good: First and foremost, the characters. They were so vivid and real, when they were hurting I was hurting too. If you don't connect with the characters then you certainly won't cry when something bad happens to them. That was definitely not the case with this book, it had me sobbing like a baby several times; it felt like my heart was being wrenched in two. Another thing is the romance between Mia and Adam. Sometimes in books the love stories just seemed forced, but from the flashback stories of how they met and their interactions with each other, it feels like they were just meant to be together. I've said this before about other couples, but they are like two pieces of a puzzle that fit together and you just can't imagine it any other way - and really you wouldn't want to. The story was just beautifully written. Honestly I can't say enough good things about it. The Bad: I can't really think of anything bad to say about this book. The only thing is when the flashbacks happened, they weren't in any sort of order. They always had some relevance to what Mia was thinking about in the present, but they jumped around a lot. That might confuse or irritate some people. I didn't mind it at all, I loved all of the flashbacks and they all enhanced the story greatly. The Ugly: I have nothing awful to say about this book; I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it    Romance Sizzle Or Fizzle: Without a doubt, 100% sizzle. I can't imagine two people who are more right together. They just seem to get each other in ways no one else does and probably never could. The whole time I was just praying for a happy ending for these two, not knowing what the author had in store for the end. My favorite part between them was when he asked her to play him like a cello. It sounds silly, but that part was just so powerful and beautiful to me.    Uniqueness Of The Plot: There have certainly been books about people dying and then getting a second chance to do things right (i.e. Here Lies Bridget), but this was definitely different than that. This was a girl stuck between life and death, literally having to make the toughest choice imaginable. I've never read another book like this and it didn't give me any sort of deja vu feeling, like I get sometimes with plots that are overused.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works well on HTC Incredible.  Very fun gameplay.  I find myself absorbed for hours.  Could be the next Angry Birds.
1935251740|5.0|Whoever expected to laugh through a science book? Dr. Lanza is entertaining and though-provoking describing the missing link how our physical make-up and conscious awareness creates our viewpoint of reality. He is still missing God, the energy of it all, but I like the way he tells it in a language anyone can understand. I get it! I'm grateful he took the time to explain what other scientists avoid.
0071636080|5.0|This book reminded me how much of my life I use presentations. I am a Toastmaster, a Realtor, and do non-profit presentations. This book is interesting and well written and I can see using it as a reference on a regular basis.
B004UOCF3W|4.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised after the first couple spins, but I have to say, the album is a bit of a shrinker.  The emotion and pain are evident, the music definitely rocks hard, but there isn't a ton of depth to the music and lyrics as a whole.  Doesn't really lend itself to infinite replay-ability as some would say.  Good... yes.  Classic?  Time will tell, but for me it isn't.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Rhianna is a true Barbadian beauty and this album trying reflects her influence in the pop, r&b, rap and dance genres. Her personal style simply accentuate her range of different personas.  She is forever making fashions statements whether on the red carpet, musical events or sking.  On every cover of all the hair, entertainment and news magazines several times a year, Rolling Stone, Vogue, and contless others.  My philosophy and continues to be if you got it you got it and Rhianna is definately in no shortage of all the important elements required for stardom.  And you can tell every time you see her that she is enjoying every minute of it and I am too.  S & M, Only Girl In the World and enough to call the offering a banger but she has Drake to add another flavor with What's My Name, and her latest video for Man Down has her at the top of the R& B charts, not to mention her collaboration with M&M that earned the number one spot on the Rap Charts.  Her sales definately reflect the popularity of this project earning Billboard top award with record setting sales.  Even the filler tracks are starting to climb the charts.  So this rating is justified.
B004LWZW42|4.0|Another year, another 'reboot' in which a studio goes younger and fools around with the successful elements of a once enormously successful 'tent-pole' in an effort to continue the success of a beloved film series. Why do they do this? The actors who helped establish the series now want a bigger piece of the pie because they have become more popular. And because they have become more popular, they are appearing in more films which makes scheduling more difficult. And maybe the producers or studio heads have decided the series needs a boost in ticket sales. Ultimately, it becomes a less painful exercise to go younger and cast up-and-coming actors to take on some of the roles which have already made other people famous. Reboots are a tricky proposition. They don't always work. But in the case of \\"X-Men: First Class\\", a director new to the series and a good cast help make this an enjoyable summer popcorn film.<br /><br />Is it as good as the first \\"X-Men\\"? No. There is just no way to replace the unmistakable force of chemistry created by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry, Famke Jannsen, James Franco and all of the others involved. But \\"First Class\\" is much better than you might expect or hope.<br /><br />We return to the early 40s. Charles Xavier, a young boy, meets a young Raven who has broken into the mansion where he lives. She is hungry and afraid her condition will scare him off. Instead, Charles, who also has strange and unique abilities, welcomes her and she becomes a part of the family. Meanwhile, in Germany, Erik Lesher, a young boy, is separated from his parents at one of the concentration camps. A doctor (Kevin Bacon) wants to unlock Erik's power and soon realizes the easiest way to do so is to make him angry. Flash forward to the early 60s. Charles (James McAvoy) and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence, \\"Winter's Bone\\") are living at Oxford while Charles finishes his doctorate. Erik (Michael Fassbender, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Jane Eyre\\") is traveling the globe trying to find the doctor and his associates, all of whom made his childhood hell. He begins the globe trotting journey in Switzerland. An FBI agent, Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, TV's \\"Damages\\", \\"Bridesmaids\\") realizes Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) and his associates are up to some mischief. She sneaks into their secret lair in Las Vegas and watches Emma Frost (January Jones, \\"Unknown\\", TV's \\"Mad Men\\") turn into a giant diamond and 'convince' an Army General to support a plan to put American missiles in Turkey. Moira realizes she needs help and reaches out to Charles. They soon meet Erik and convince him to help. With the assistance of a doctor (Oliver Platt) involved with the CIA, they search out other Mutants to recruit. After a quick training session, they learn Shaw and his associates are trying to start World War III and the tensions are escalating around Cuba.<br /><br />Directed by Matthew Vaughn, the director of \\"LayerCake\\", \\"Kick-Ass\\" and \\"Stardust\\" (which is, by the way, a horrifically underrated film), brings a lot of unique touches to the film, making it fun and exciting to watch.<br /><br />James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are both very good and evoke the character traits, mannerisms and sensibilities of who their characters will become and how they are portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan later. Strangely, they both manage to make the performances seem fresh and interesting. You will recognize the Stewart and McKellan versions of these characters but both of the younger actors portray their characters with a wink, wink, nudge, nudge kind of inside knowledge. The performances are fun but also respectful of the other actors' work.<br /><br />McAvoy has been around for a while and done some great work in very serious films like \\"Atonement\\". In \\"X-Men\\", he brings these dramatic chops to the role of Charles Xavier, lending his portrayal a certain amount of gravity. Xavier is the leader of this group, its moral center. He has to be the stern one, the one to set people on the right path. But younger Charles isn't beyond noticing when one of the trainees falls on his face and needs a little pick-me-up. There is also a lot of playfulness in his relationship with Raven, playfulness which makes him seem more age appropriate.<br /><br />When Xavier learns what is going on, there are a few too many of the \\"This is what is happening and this is why we must stop it\\" type of statements. Some of these are illustrated with graphics or brief montages which make them more interesting, but too often they seem to be simply a way for the writers to get from one point to the next with the least amount of work. In the end, these moments seem a little too sloppy and bring the quality of the film down.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender, last seen as Mr. Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre\\", is the more interesting of the two. As he begins his journey of retribution, he turns on the charm and menace, usually at the same time, making his entire persona a mystery. When we first pick up with him as an adult, he is hunting the German Concentration Camp doctor (Bacon) who made his life miserable as a young boy. His hatred is not something that has simply developed and his need for revenge must be satisfied. This need is driving his actions and failure is simply not an option. In fact, failure could drive him mad. He meets with various people, trying to track down the doctor and his associates, and this trek takes him to many corners of the globe. Each person needs to be persuaded, because the Doctor has a lot of secrets to hide and many people are willing to help him. But Erik's mutant powers prove to be very persuasive.<br /><br />When Erik finally tracks the doctor, who now uses the name Shaw, to Florida, he also comes across Charles, Mystique and Moira, all of whom are already trying to capture Shaw. Eventually, they come to realize what Shaw has in mind and Charles convinces Erik to join forces to take him down.<br /><br />What I liked most about the relationship between Charles and Erik is that we see a genuine friendship build and grow between them. Of course, there are hints at this in the first three \\"X-Men\\", but McAvoy and Fassbender convincingly portray the friendship and camaraderie their characters are supposed to have had in the beginning.<br /><br />It is also interesting to watch Erik deal with the dueling sides of his persona. In the beginning, he doesn't want to have anything to do with his mutant side, but anger unleashes his powers and the evil Doctor soon unlocks Erik's anger. Then, when he meets Charles, Xavier helps him to harness the power and to amplify it, without the accompanying anger. Later, Erik begins to deal with his mixed feelings towards humans. As he becomes closer to Charles, he sees how his friend feels about humans, the eternal hope he feels for them, and this causes even more mixed emotions within. But Erik has a deep seated hatred for humans based on how they have treated him and tried to exploit his powers. He and Charles are also fighting to stop Shaw, but there are moments when he isn't exactly sure he disagrees with Shaw.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon plays the doctor who almost twenty years later will change his name to Shaw and become a respected and rich member of society. Bacon was a real surprise and his performance adds a lot of fun to the film. First of all, casting Bacon as someone who doesn't age is almost brilliant. The character's similarities to Dorian Gray are explained by his own quest. And as the villain, he almost never raises his voice, yet, you sense the menace every time he comes on screen. Early in the film, as a doctor at a German concentration camp, he just exudes menace yet he smiles and laughs throughout most of the scene. This is the mark of many memorable villains. Michael Caine once remarked that if an actor is playing a drunk person by using slurred speech and stumbling around, they will ultimately look like an actor playing a drunk person. It is much more natural to tone it down and give subtle hints the character is drunk. Frequently, the best villains are portrayed as people who don't appear menacing. Yet, one word or turn of the eye is all we need to get a sense of their true threat.<br /><br />Later, when he returns to the story, we learn he is trying to instigate World War III. He uses his connections and the powers of his mutant friends to influence some key people. He seems to be getting closer to his goal when he is able to influence an American General to vote in his favor.<br /><br />There are a number of reasons why Shaw resembles a villain from a James Bond film. And when these moments happen, it does detract from the overall effect. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of James Bond films, but they are always a bit jokey, a bit tongue-in-cheek. This works to a certain extent in a superhero film, but you also want an \\"X-Men\\" film to be intense. The James Bond moments are just a little too jokey and pull you out of the moment.<br /><br />The more time we spend with Shaw, the more we learn of his powers and the power of his friends. They are a powerful group.<br /><br />January Jones plays Emma Frost, Shaw's right arm. Jones seems to be channeling the spirit of former James Bond villainesses and it almost works. She has the cool, steely reserve, the beauty and the unemotional demeanor of one of Blofeld's right arms. Jason Flemyng, who seems to appear in every film directed by Guy Ritchie or Matthew Vaughn, plays Azazeal, a red skinned mutant who looks a bit like the devil. He is able to teleport to places and often grabs his foe and teleports to the sky about 100 feet above ground before letting go of the other person.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult are the stand-outs in the new group of recruits. Not coincidentally, they also have the most screen time. Jennifer Lawrence, so memorable in \\"Winter's Bone\\", plays Raven/ Mystique. She practically grows up with Charles and becomes his sister. She, like Erik, is also struggling with her place in a world of humans. And Nicholas Hoult (\\"A Single Man\\", BBC's \\"Skins\\", \\"About a Boy\\") plays Hank McCoy, who will become Beast. Hank and Raven are both struggling with how their mutation affects their appearance and how they are able to blend in with human society.<br /><br />Vaughn does a great job. He keeps the familiar iconography and elements of the franchise intact while adding a few little tongue-in-cheek moments, making the overall film distinctly something he can claim as his own.<br /><br />\\"X-Men: First Class\\" is a lot of fun and a thrilling way to get reacquainted with the characters we have come to love.<br /><br />When Charles and Erik are recruiting members of their new team, there are hints to the existence of other mutants, many of whom will become future members of the X-Men. This positions the inevitable future sequels. Thankfully, this moment is integrated into the story and doesn't seem like such a blatant attempt to create a sequel.genuine friendship build and grow between them.

B0034G4ORM|1.0|Beware Sci-Fi fans, Battle: Los Angeles is not what it seems. The film feels more like a War film than a Sci-Fi film, focusing mostly on the Marines. The Marines are walking clichés, they are constantly cursing and make pretty shallow jokes. One of the characters says such a stupid sex joke to Michelle Rodriguez's character, you see it coming from a mile a way.  The film almost doesn't know what it wants to be. It is a terrible, shallow film. Don't bother watching it.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I was FORCED to watch this last night by my girlfriend, she balled all over how great it was.  It was not.  First is the story, it's gap filled with zero explaination of what the hell is going on and when you are led to fill in the blanks yourself the rest of the movie's improbable and impossible plot make you even less likely to rationalize anything you are watching.  There is allot of action in this movie.  Like its a CGI fans wet dream.  But there is no story and less likeable characters.  Wesley the main character is a constantly sweaty and aggitated doofus, whom you can't even remotely root for, in fact I hoped he got wacked throughout the entire movie as he said the most annoying things at the oddest times.  Jolie is in this movie and she gives the usual dead pan acting while making sexy faces.  She is a horrible actor, period.  Morgan Freeman also graces this \\"epic\\" of unrealistic violence as the-of course-smart and wise elderly leader.  There isn't much to like about this movie, its all been done before countless times and the story is flimsy and makes little sense.  Don't watch this unless you really are simple minded.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My 4 year old & 2 year old loved this movie.  The message is sweet. It is very colorful and entertaining and we loved the music.  My oldest son still asks me a month later if we can watch the birdie movie.  I would highly recommend it, and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
0316067938|3.0|This is my favorite of the Twilight saga.  The part written from Jacob's perspective is a refreshing change.  It was also interesting to see how Belle adapted and learned after becoming a vampire.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|these headphones are very comfortable and sound very good as well. For the price i bought them for. I most defiantly got my money's worth
B000O77SRC|3.0|I gave this movie 3 stars because of the main character: the F bomb. If constant, and I mean, constant four letter words offend you then do not buy this movie. I have to watch it in French just so I can get through it. Other than that, it's a great movie classic.
B002G1YPH0|2.0|If you have an existing system (with a motherboard already installed, in a case with no access to the back of the mobo), this is one of the worst installations to do - you'll have to pull everything out and wrangle with the motherboard in order to get the backplate mount in place. Not pleasant, and in my opinion not necessary, given some of the other mounting/install methods I've used.    A Scythe Ninja I have on another AMD/AM3 socket system - while costing a bit more - was far easier to install.     Noise level and cooling are good, but the CPU contact area seems a bit rougher than optimal - though that probably doesn't affect overall cooling efficiency by more than a few degrees.       And note that while the picture shows two fans, the second is optional - the product only comes with one.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because unlike the first two, there's no f bomb. Only one or two s*** words, but those are easy to overlook. This movie is very entertaining, and Bruce Willis, as usual, does not disappoint. I saw this at the movies, and liked it enough to purchase the DVD. If you're a Bruce Willis and Die Hard fan, by all means, add this to your collection.
B004TACMZ8|4.0|The Bosch Digital Multi-Scanner generally works as described with the use of a 9V 'rechargeable' battery.  The Scanner also impressively worked as a metal detector to locate screw holders that were dropped/lost in the thick grass outdoor our workshop.     However, in a repeated case of using the Multi-mode detection feature, the device found steel pipes, but could not detect the live wiring on one side, which were encased behind a solid wall.  We tried testing it again from a different angle on another side, and it finally located the wires.      So, it seems the three sensor technology may have a 91% reliability, but we'll see how it fairs on other projects, as it does work well in detecting metals.
0525422943|5.0|See above for full synopsis.    \\"Where She Went\\" takes place three years after \\"If I Stay\\" ends and flashes back and forth quite often.  It is told through Adam's point of view and focuses on what he went though after the accident that killed Mia's family and the three years since Mia left for Juilliard and New York and \\"dumped him.\\"    Adam makes us see that being a rock star is not always so glamorous.  Being in the limelight, having a movie star girlfriend, being recognized everywhere he goes can't erase his feelings for Mia and the hurt that is eating him up.  Adam has a strong voice and it's interesting hearing this love story with his lyrics and thoughts.    I enjoyed this as much as the first book and although not necessary to read \\"If I Stay\\" first it is suggested to do so.
0446615641|3.0|I am a book lover and this story was nicely crafted and timely. Not very suspenseful, but I did enjoy the book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I just want to point out that I enjoyed Catching Fire greatly but compared to the two other books (which I consider extraordinary) Catching Fire is not at that level.<br /><br />The first half is a great read, you can go from the end of book 1 to the start of book 2 and not miss a beat. It has the same beat, the same momentum. Katniss may be out of the arena but she's still playing in the Games.<br /><br />The problem with Catching Fire is the second half when the Quell or 75th Games begins.<br /><br />It just feels like after the first book that it's a bit anticlimactic. Mrs. Collins does plenty to differentiate the Quell from the 74th game but I just didn't find it gripping as the rest of the book.<br /><br />While there are some great things about the Quell (like the introduction of some critical new characters) I felt it it didn't have the same momentum and urgency as the first half of the book. The writing got a bit complicated and convoluted which I didn't encounter in books 1, 2 plus the first half of CF.<br /><br />And I don't want to say too much to give anything away but the conclusion of the Quell is a bit of a letdown personally.<br /><br />But I want to point out that while it wasn't perfect CF is far from being the boring middle child of the trilogy. It had it's moments and while it lagged in the later half it did it's job which was to set all the pieces for the conclusion of the trilogy.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|For an album that I couldn't help but purchase when I got the news that's it was out on the store for 99 cents, this is well worth it. Better yet, I should have got this for free. The title speaks for itself; every track is so good, that it was hard for me to choose a favorite, but if there is one track that tops them all, it has to be Scheibe. However, that's no knock to the other tracks like Highway Unicorn, Americano, Marry The Night. Now, as good as this is, I just wished that the Mother Monster would have convinced Amazon to sell the special edition for the same price, because those of us who bought this album are (sort of) missing out on the extra goodies like Fashion of His Love. Then there are the remixes which take the \\"awesomeness\\" to a new level. I can see myself in the club dancing to the Scheibe remix. Either way, with or without the bonuses, the album is good. It's hard to believe Gaga is this powerful, because I could relate to some of these songs too. For me, this is the start of life as a little monster...    By the way, for some fans who compare Gaga to Britney Spears, I must say that both artists are very good. They have totally different music, backgrounds, lifestyles, and it's two artists who dominated two separates halves of the 2000s, so there's no battle out here. BOTH are good!! You'll love every track of [[ASIN:B004KSQN7C Femme Fatale Deluxe]] too!!
0439023513|2.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games...the first two books were really well written and laid out. However, this last book did not meet the same standards. I find myself reading it just to know what happens but found it really boring and uninteresting.
B002RKSZWG|4.0|There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews.  This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated.  I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly.  The end did feel a little rushed.  However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.<br /><br />Specific to Kindle:  Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation.  While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying.
0345529057|4.0|I've been reading along with watching the HBO series and enjoying both very much. UNTIL - reading along early in Book Three I encountered a printing defect - pages 113 through 176 were missing and later pages inserted.  Thumbing through, I found that the wrongly inserted pages were a duplicated section and the 113-176 were nowhere to be found... DRATS!!! right in the middle of a chapter on my favorite character - Daenerys! So now I have to file for a return and box up the whole set to return to Amazon!  I HOPE that when I get the replacement I don't find an exact copy of this problem.    But aside from the above snag... I greatly recommend the books.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Denzel Washington brings his A Game to every role, and THE BOOK OF ELI is no exception; in fact, this might be one of the actor's finest performances, as Washington plays Eli, a quiet, peace-loving man--yet peace rarely finds him--on a mission of destiny in a post-apocalyptic world.  By now everyone knows what The Book is, and that it is desperately coveted by those who would wield it to control the surviving population, including Carnegie (a brooding Gary Oldman), the kingpin of a town splashed in the midst of desolation.  Thus THE BOOK OF ELI becomes a story of pursuit, with Washington making his way west (followed by young Solara, played by Mila Kunis), with Carnegie's henchmen on his trail.<br /><br />The story is told simply, the settings are compelling and believable, and Washington performs with a grace and dignity that is stunning.  Interspersed throughout the film are several memorable roles, including Jennifer Beals (playing Solara's blind mother), Ray Stevenson (as Redridge, Carnegie's lieutenant), Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour (a cannibalistic couple armed to the max), and Malcolm McDowell (a scholar at the end of Eli's quest).  My only problem with THE BOOK OF ELI centers around the violent confrontations; suspension of disbelief becomes exceedingly difficult when Eli constantly battles hordes of thugs, mows them down like grass, and walks away unscathed.  Annoying to be sure, but not annoying enough to take enjoyment away from a commanding performance and a very moving film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B004WCTLNY|2.0|I was so surprised how bored I was with this movie starring Matt Damon. I love him and Emily Blunt. I only wish I had waited for cable on this one. I wasted my money.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|There is little need to here further describe Uchida's mastery of the Mozart repertoire: Uchida has repeatedly impressed the world with performances that are the results of years and years of intense practice and her detailed reflection on Mozart's musical gems. This particular set of recordings, a complete cycle of all of Mozart's Piano Concertos in 2006, is certainly reflective of Uchida's accomplishment: the set is a stellar recording that should not be missed by nearly anyone who loves the \\"27\\" piano concertos.<br /><br />I own--and have come to love--two previous complete sets of Mozart's Piano Concertos, both of which are also not to be missed. First, the famed recordings of Bilson on Deutsche Grammophon's \\"Archive\\" label ([[ASIN:B00002DEGZ Mozart: The Piano Concertos]]) and second, the truly amazing set by Perahia ([[ASIN:B000GLKLCK Mozart: Complete Piano Concertos]]). It can be somewhat counterproductive to explain and defend why such sets can be considered among the best, due to the divergence of opinions of what makes a set truly \\"great.\\" In my own mind, Bilson's cycle sets a standard in great playing on a period instrument, with an excellent recording and a fantastic performance by Gardiner and The English Baroque Soloists; and Perahia's cycle, though perhaps not sonically recorded as well as Bilson's, reveals a remarkable interpretive and skillful playing by Perahia that is unique to this performer. I've listened to both of these recordings for years and years, and have come to know them well.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Uchida achieves what is truly a remarkable outcome, and that is to have her cycle rightly included with those such as Perahia's and Bilson's. Her playing is remarkably perfected, her skill at handling even the most difficult passages crafted to meet and exceed all expectations, and her interpretation of the pieces is largely transparent (meaning that we are not continually reminded that so-and-so is performing, but rather, can just listen to Mozart himself). I was somewhat surprised to be able to come to this conclusion due to the high bar that I knew already existed, but I have to admit Uchida meets it well, and deserves (and receives) her status amongst the best Mozart performers).<br /><br />The technical sound recording here is also very good. There is a high dynamic range, no noticeable background noise, and the sound stage seems to be well defined. Performance by Tate and The English Chamber Orchestra is consistently excellent.<br /><br />We can also add one other amazing this about this set. It is remarkably inexpensive. The set can currently be had from Amazon at just a tad above thirty dollars, which is truly amazing, when one considers what the set represents.<br /><br />This is an easy five star recommendation for those just beginning to explore Mozart's wonderful Piano Concertos or those who have previously explored some of the other great cycle recordings. The price makes is a six star recommendation.<br /><br />Other Sets:<br /><br />Pehahia on Sony: [[ASIN:B000GLKLCK Mozart: Complete Piano Concertos]]<br /><br />Bilson on Archive: [[ASIN:B000FI9OKE Mozart: Piano Sonatas, Complete [Box Set]]]<br /><br />Brendel on Philips: [[ASIN:B00000410O Mozart Piano Concertos: Complete Mozart Edition]]o Mozart himself).

B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Everything went just as I expected it.  The movie itself is a gritty depiction of life in LA. Not for the faint of heart!
0739308742|1.0|I share the concern of many of the reviewers who wonder if Martin will take twelve years to tie up all the loose threads he's woven into this amazing series, but even so this book still delivers a wonderful story with compelling characters and adroit writing.    However, why on earth did they switch narrators?  Roy Dotrice was an amazing reader.  In fact, much of my enjoyment of the first three books was due to his narration, which made even Martin's obsession with long and detailed accounts of what everyone is wearing worth listening too, and the voices of each of the characters brought the dialogue and even the folk songs to a whole new level of brillance.  It was jarring and disappointing to have a different narrator, even if that narrator was a good, which unfortunately he is not.    One of the biggest disappointments in my audio book listening experience.
B00466M25A|5.0|Review of the $30 Canadian version:  The one star refers not to the movie, which for me, is a five-star movie, but rather to the cheaply done blu-ray version of this movie.  All the commentaries, extras, subtitles, etc., have been stripped out in this overpriced ($30 USD) Canadian version of the blu-ray, as compared with DVD versions.  It's so sad, because I own the American, German, and Czech versions of the movie on DVD, which have all been well done, with all the extras you would expect.  This new stripped down no-menu 'your movie will start now' without your control, idea of creating blu-rays is awful!  Shame on companies who cheaply do this just to get something quickly out on blu-ray!  The whole idea of blu-ray is not just the high def, but also all that available space so that you CAN add other languages, extras, etc.  Talk about a waste of space on a blu-ray disc!  I have also noticed this same thing with two other blu-rays I've purchased recently, movies I really love:  \\"The Return\\" and \\"Dark Water\\" (all three of these are my most recent blu-ray purchases and seem to indicate a trend, heaven forbid).  The movie starts automatically without the ability to go to a menu and when you hit the menu button, you get the \\"forbidden\\" sign.  If you're lucky enough to have a \\"pop-up menu\\" button on your blu-ray player, then you can sometimes get some minimal functionality through that -- but still not much.  On this DVD, the entirety of all extras and extra functionality is that you can listen to it in French or English, not even any subtitles!  The DVD versions are what you should purchase if you want to have anything beyond that.  I'm not sure the high def alone is worth it if all my blu-rays have no extras nor ability to control the little functionality that may exist on them.  Update as of 20 April 2012:  I see that another version of this movie is coming out on Blu-Ray.  It is half the price of the other.  Hopefully it will have the extras that were stripped out of the other!<br /><br />Review of the $15 American version:  Update as of 10 July 2012:  I am SOO pleased with the new blu-ray disc of 2012!  It looks like the definition problem has been fixed.  Extras have all been added back in.  This is the American version, available for half the price ($15.00) of the useless Canadian one.  All the wonderful extras of the DVD were added back in.  Other languages were added, and to my delight, a Czech language track (I'm currently learning Czech full blast).  In short, I've changed my rating back to a 5-star rating and added this update.  I'm so glad that those responsible for making this and doing it right this time!  Hats off!  Thank you...finally.

B004ZH66XO|3.0|Move your fish around the screen eating smaller fishes and avoiding bigger fishes. Progress through the levels with your fish doing almost exactly the same thing each level. This game is almost the same as Feeding Frenzy. The developers point out that in this version of the game you can drag your fish around your touch screen. I found that even on my Thunderbolt the screen is far too small to do this as your hand blocks your view. Fortunately, you can switch back to the joystick controls.<br /><br />If you like Feeding Frenzy you will like this game. I did somewhat and do somewhat. It was an okay game when free, but I wouldn't pay for it.

1594744769|4.0|After reading a review of this book just before it came out, I was completely intrigued.  The idea of these spooky, vintage photographs building the framework of a story seemed to be a novel (pun intended) concept to me, so I rushed to Book People (my favorite little literary haven here in Austin) to snatch it up the first chance I got.  Having just finished Crime and Punishment, I was hoping for a less difficult page-turner, and that is exactly what I got.  No, the character motivation isn't exactly clear at times, but the description and imagery make up for that ten-fold.      I love a good adventure, a good fantasy, and a good thriller, and this story weaves elements of those genres and more in a fascinating way, not to mention how cleverly the photographs are integrated into the tale.  The \\"peculiar\\" thing is, though, that I didn't necessarily care about the characters (which may have to do with the fact that some of them are underdeveloped, and, as I previously stated, their motives for doing certain things aren't particularly sensible).  More than wanting to know if they survived or succeeded, I wanted to keep reading to know what happened next, what other fantastic imagery I would meet, and how the author would complete the story, happy ending or not.  It is extremely clear that another novel is on the way, because the end left plenty of story to be told, and I look forward to being able to read a second entry into what will (I hope) be a series of Peculiar books.      I would recommend Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children to a few types of people: those who love a good yarn, those who seek out books based on their descriptive merits, and those who want to add a little touch of the extraordinary into their worlds, even if just vicariously.  After reading it, I felt satisfied, and my interest was piqued to not only devour another installment as soon as it hits the shelves, but also to search for the extraordinary in my own world, my own family lore, andall those ancient, peeling photographs that wound up in my hands from great aunts and grandmothers who did such a great job documenting their young, vibrant lives.  Is there a story to be found within them?  I would venture to say that yes, there is, and I only wish that Ransom Riggs would find it.     Great read.  Not perfect, but I've never encountered a book that is.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|There's a glum look on Geoff Johns' face right now. This is what happens when a picture like THE DARK KNIGHT is lavished with all that prestige. The backlash on ensuing - and inferior - superhero flicks is that much more pronounced. And GREEN LANTERN, the first DC Comics big screen venture since THE DARK KNIGHT, becomes the sacrificial lamb. This is like Jimi Hendrix being followed by a banjo-strummin' Okie from Muskogee. Factoring in Green Lantern's recent resurgence as a relevant figure in the DC universe, I expected more out of this film. I don't mean the special effects, which I thought were mostly fine. Thing of it is, those unfamiliar with the Green Lantern Corps and its cosmic mythology will probably benefit more from the viewing, because it's all fresh and new to 'em. GL is essentially an intergalactic police officer, and that's a cool hook. But if you're a longtime reader of Green Lantern, then this may not be the movie you've been clamoring for. Oh, the respectful treatment is there. I do believe the filmmakers tried their best to be true to the subject matter. But why must the narrative come off so clunky? I actually have friends who read the comic book and they're pumped up after watching the thing. So mileage may vary; it may vary a lot.<br /><br />I don't believe this to be as bad as the professional critics are intimating (intimating... hell, they're shouting the film's suckiness from the roof tops). But it's not about to make anyone forget about THE DARK KNIGHT or even X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. I think it rates about 2.5 out of 5 stars, which means it's an average film. Again, the film tries so hard to be true to the source material, and maybe that focus became too narrow a beam. There's such a painstaking attempt to lay down the groundwork - whether it's informing us of the grand-scaled Green Lantern Corps mythos or of Hal Jordan's more personal narrative - that it forgets to breathe life into the story. The film is flat. Blame the lazy writing, the tedious exposition, the lame dialogue. When Hal Jordan passionately pleads with the Guardians for a chance to defend his planet - but then Hal's big closing sales pitch is the \\"we're only human\\" speech - one Guardian actually has the gall to declare his argument \\"compelling.\\" This Guardian probably has Ben Stein as a Friend on his Facebook.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, and he's played him better. It's as if the dying Abin Sur crashlanded on Earth, instructed his ring to seek his rightful successor, and the ring then came back with Van Wilder. I never once bought Reynolds as cocky test pilot Hal Jordan. It doesn't help that the film makes Jordan into a mopey character. The Hal Jordan I'm familiar with wouldn't get all whiny and decide he's not cut out for the Corps after only a brief session with Kilowog and one beatdown from Sinestro. And then there's the patented Ryan Reynolds comedy schtick. Sometimes gimmick casting works, sometimes nope. It certainly did with Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, but as much as I enjoy Ryan Reynolds, I would have to label his Hal Jordan as a fail. I've a feeling he'll do better as Deadpool, a character much more suited to his glib persona. By the way, I'm now officially more concerned about Chris Evans as Captain America.<br /><br />The fear-consuming Parallax as the Big Bad is a Big Bad Choice, especially as how he's so poorly designed, all tentacly and amorphous and cloudy and looking like poo. I didn't want to call the Green Lantern Corps. I wanted to call the housemaid for clean-up on Sector 2814. And Imhotep called. He wants his blurry face back. Meanwhile, Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) comes off pretty pathetic here, that poor nebbish (yet creepy) xenobiologist. As if Hammond weren't comfortable enough in his own skin, damn if he doesn't get infected with Parallax's yellow fear juice and begins warping into a freakish funhouse mirror version of himself. This doesn't improve his chances with the lovely Carol Ferris. Hammond becomes so grotesque that even John Merrick just handed him a brown paper bag with eyeholes cut out. On the bright side, he develops telekinesis and he can now read people's minds. Because what he really needs right now is to eavesdrop on what people think of his new, ridiculously fugly figure. Hector Hammond also screams like a girl, which validates my earliest impression of him.<br /><br />Now Blake Lively is worth ogling. I clung to that grimly as I watched her not have chemistry with Reynolds, as I watched her be bland in her role of Carol Ferris (who, granted, even in the comic books, had always been dull as dictionaries). Her and Reynold's romance seems forced, although not as forced as Thor and Jane Foster's thing in their movie. Still, whenever their feeble courtship is shoved up front and center, things come to a screeching halt. Their banter is pretty weak.<br /><br />Not that the film doesn't have its good bits. For one, I love how green energy would course along those lines on Hal's costume. But I despise the mask.<br /><br />Hal's ring constructs are marked by a distinct lack of imagination. Seriously, a race car?<br /><br />How did Hal know to show up just in time for his first big throwdown with Hector Hammond?<br /><br />I gaze at the ancient Guardians of the Universe, those blue midgets, as they pass judgment on everyone and everything from atop their lofty pillars of stone in their citadel, and I wonder how they go about their bathroom breaks.<br /><br />The sense I get is that Amanda Waller is being groomed to be DC's version of Nick Fury. By the way, it doesn't seem right that CCH Pounder isn't playing her.<br /><br />My favorite moment may be that scene in which Green Lantern visits Carol Ferris at her apartment after having just saved her life. What happens there may be the single most clever thing the film accomplishes. I liked the cameos by Abin Sur, Kilowog, Tomar Re, and Sinestro. Mark Strong, I thought, was the most impressive actor here. He is regal and works perfectly as Hal's militant foil. It would've been something to see Sinestro finally turn that corner, become the vile villain he was meant to be. But with the way this film's come all ha1fassed, I don't know if there'll be a sequel. Still, you should stick around for the teaser scene during the closer credits which introduces further developments.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|This is definitely one of her best albums to date; my other favorites are Britney(2001), In the Zone(2004) and the much-beleaguered Blackout(2007).  The deluxe version is worth getting; the additional tracks are NOT filler, but solid, well-crafted songs--particularly \\"Up N Down\\" and \\"He About to Lose Me\\".  Whatever you may think of her personally, she's singing her best, the songs are solid and varied and the music is pure pleasure.  The three songs released to date as singles(\\"Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Till the World Ends\\" and \\"I Wanna Go\\") are all worthy of their status, but hardly scratch the surface of what's to come.  Here are a few standout tracks I especially like:    1)\\"(Drop Dead)Beautiful\\"--the first track that made me sit up and say Wow!, which is not an easy feat.  Funky, sassy, upbeat \\"come hither\\" track; Britney at her best, and a nice rap by featured guest Sabi as well.  Femmes Fatales only need apply;    2)\\"Up N Down\\"--intense, no-nonsense dance track; get on the floor and get down or go home!    3)\\"He About to Lose Me\\"--has a subtle reggae-ish flavor that lends interest to this mid-tempo track about the waning days of a love affair;    4)\\"Criminal\\"--VERY interesting!  A folksy dance ballad about the perils of loving a \\"bad boy\\"; has a 70s vibe mashed with a contemporary dance rhythm and yet it comes off as creativity done right rather than a mess.  Bravo to Britney and her team for this one in particular; no standardized \\"pop\\" music here!    5)\\"Trip to Your Heart\\"--a trance-y dance ballad, mid-tempo and enough to slow down with after the mass influx of upbeat songs previous to it before catching your second wind for all the rest;    6)\\"Inside Out\\"--a true ballad, about letting one's guard down for your true love despite any initial trepidation.    All the others, save \\"Big Fat Bass\\"(a definite love-it-or-hate-it song, which I always skip and do not miss by doing so), stand on their own very well, also.  This is a must-have album, whatever format you prefer to purchase.
B004EPYZOY|1.0|I hardly ever do reviews on here but I felt the need to warn people of this horrible movie. I love cheesy B type movies, and when I read the plot and reviews on this I thought it would be right up my alley. Sounded like a grindhouse type flick with lots of action. Boy was I wrong. The acting in this film is TERRIBLE. Especially the girl riding around with Nic Cage. I guess they cast her cus she was good looking cus her acting is awful. I think Nic Cage is a pretty good actor. But I dont know what he is thinking when he takes the scripts he agrees to do. For the most part most of his movies are bad. But this is beyond bad! Its easy to see why this movie flopped. Watching it on Blu ray, you could really tell how rushed and low budget this movie was. My son walked in the room and looked at the screen and asked why I didnt get the Blu-ray copy of this. I had to tell him it was the blu-ray copy. It was almost like watching a SYFY original movie in terms of video quality. I'm glad I rented from a redbox and only paid a dollar for it. Opening scene was promising, everything beyond that is awful!!!! Hilariously bad screeching rock music when Nic Cage steps out of the car. Hilarious bad dialogue and kiss between Nic and a waitress at the diner. Tom Atkins isnt given much to do in this and almost looks depressed in the few scenes he's in. Avoid this at all costs!!!
B002PNAY9C|5.0|please note i am writing this from a kindle so there may be errors. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, from cover to cover  I was in it. Howerver there are a few things  would change. Like the way eragon and roran dealt with the slaves to be saraficed. but that sort of passes because they wanted to die.  also found the plot a little slow in some places, parrticlrly the dwarf land where there is a lo of time spent doing nothing. realy nothing because eragon just sort of observes. I also seriously dislike to character Elva. she is really strange to me. i know she is important to the plot, but she should have been in her teens, not a little child with an adult voice.  also dont recommend this to weak stomach people. this is real war, it spares no deatils. Howerver though i have sad bad thigs there are many good things. the story is beuatiful. The action is intense and engrossing i absolutley love the rescue from helgrind. from rzac wars to saphia vs lthbaraka. its great. the authr also leaves you thinking. questions like what would you do in that situation arelikeley to arise bettween you and your freinds discussing this book. you will love it!

Some of the lyrics seem to have been written by a teenaged girl......I'm not kidding.  The musicianship is fine...not great, but fine.  The songs themselves are tired and trying to be radio friendly.  Nikki has become a bloated windbag. I buy lots of music and almost always find some redeming quality to a cd.  This one seems to have none.  Even the cover is trying to hard.  It seems to me that Nikki Sixx has become a caricature of himself.....and his music an example of what happens when an artist (?) takes himself waaaaay to seriously. Many of us are getting tired of his heroine stories..I was leagally dead........blah, blah, blah...who cares..lots of homeless people have the same stories.....If you are looking for a self serving, celebrity album, rather than one done by a musician with integrity, get this release......if not, skip it.
0307454541|4.0|After hearing about this book from many of my friends I finally decided to give it a read. I had been hesitant to read it because I wasn't sure of the content of the book (language, sex, violence) and as it turns out I was right to be wary. I did enjoy the book, but there were quite a few things that would make me hesitant to recommend it to my friends. The plot itself was ingeniously written and I honestly was kept guessing right up to the big reveal of who the murderer/antagonist was. I really enjoyed Lisbeth's character. The main character, Mikael believes she has Asperger's, although she has never been diagnosed. She is extremely intelligent and resourceful. I have to admit that I was rooting for her to get even with those who had wronged her and quite liked the way she took matters into her own hands (I guess I wouldn't make it in France).<br /><br />***Not quite a spoiler*** My very favorite part of the book was the end...when she proves her intelligence and imagination reaches far beyond society's expectations. I also loved that Mikael was the only to see through the ruse...
B0025KVLV0|3.0|Since I just bought my CD version of \\"Let It Be\\" a couple of years ago (same time I bought the \\"Naked\\" CD), can somebody please list the details of the movie contained on the disc-specifically how long it is and what it consists of (interviews, scenes of the band recording, etc)? I'm trying to figure out if I have to buy this album AGAIN (I bought the original vinyl when it was first released when I was 10 years old).. Thanks Beatles fans!

B003Y5H54W|1.0|Does deserve 2 starts for graphics but this 1 will offset the bs high ratings elsewhere.    Boring delivery, and main girl is goofy not hot at all.    Graphics are somewhat good but annoying trend in movies to make things fat so you can't see them is boring.    Monster Movie I wana see damn monster!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I think so. 2007's \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting in repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure!<br /><br />This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films.<br /><br />Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom.<br /><br />On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume.<br /><br />Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun.<br /><br />The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition:<br /><br />- Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.<br />- Themes of humble remorse, friendship and faithfulness are touched on.<br />- The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.<br />- What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgivenness.<br />- On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let alone a superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior.<br /><br />You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong,other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own).<br /><br />On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit.<br /><br />My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: \\"Spider-Man 3\\" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time.<br /><br />GRADE: Al was in a league of their own).    On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy!

B000O174CM|4.0|For anyone who likes musicals, this is a keeper.  I respect and admired the cast but the best were from Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, and Eddie Murphy.  Jamie Foxx was good but not exactly his cup of tea compared to his Oscar-winning role as Ray Charles in Ray.  Beyonce was great I confess, she earned herself a Golden Globe Nomination for her acting but I guess the Academy did not consider her to be better.  Either way Hudson and Murphy really stole the show.  Murphy when it comes to conversing himself to his role, he really did well.  Comparing Murphy to his role, they could not be a better combination especially when their egos are just the same.  James Thunder Earrly was a singer in his own time so was Eddie Murphy as a comedian and just like Earrly he loses.  Not alot of people know this, but Murphy was going through a divorce with his wife at the time and he was spending time with his fiance who is now not.  Either way Murphy lost his Oscar to the old guy from Little Miss Sunshine.  Hudson on the other hand plays a woman who had her ups and downs in her singing career and in the end she wins back what she lost and ironically Hudson wins the Oscar and that is where her singing career started.  Either way very entertaining and mostly musical to a point where you are cheering for the cast like crazy.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|CD Review     So Beautiful or So What by Paul Simon  Hear Music/Concord Music Group    From the first swoosh of the steam engine to the last sustained \\"soooo beautiful,\\" there are multiple rhythms, instrumentations and meanings to discover and delight within Paul Simon's exquisite new CD, So Beautiful or So What.  Each experience of listening to this multi-layered album is a journey of discovery for the discerning ear, where one will hear everything from a Baptist minister in his own foreboding words, as well as reference to another Baptist minister who inspired our country.  In the opening track, Getting Ready for Christmas Day, the steady rhythm and percussive beat compels your feet to move as Simon poses the same questions that we clergy ask to our congregations when early November rolls around.  Inserted into the song is a sampling of a 1941 sermon by the Rev. J.M. Gates, a Baptist minister and singer from Atlanta who recorded over 200 prophetic and now sometimes amusing warnings.  Simon's arrangement of Gates' dire warnings sandwiched in-between his own prophetic ponderings result in a contemporary call and response piece with a traditional call and response layered within it.  We clergy can only hope that someday our own sermons might find new life within the song of a similarly gifted and wise musician.     With every measure of the album one discovers percussive treats that seamlessly slide in and out, complementing the lyrics, enhancing the experience and whose gentle sounds are often sustained right into the space between the notes.  They include everything from a glockenspiel to a train whistle, bells and wind chimes, a treasure trove of Indian percussive instruments and, at times, Simon's own voice.     In the angelic Amulet, one is taken to a heavenly place by Simon's expressive guitar fingerings, gentle harmonics and his own breath.   In the ballad, Love and Hard Times, Simon spiritually and emotionally brings the listener to an exquisitely tender andgentle moment of gratitude for longtime love - a moment that will compel the listener to pause herself and give thanks.      The album ends as it began with lyrics that pose questions of how we choose to live. In the title track, So Beautiful or So What, a song that references the tragic shooting of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Simon asks us to choose how we shall live: positively or pessimistically?  Despite the hard and difficult times that befall each one of us or our communities, despite the ways we \\"jigger it and figure it,\\" which path from the album's title will choose?  Will we live a life that is so beautiful?  Or will we say, \\"So what?\\"  Simon himself makes a choice; he leaves us with a beat that keeps us moving forward, a beat that motivates us to live a life that is \\"sooo...beautiful.\\"      Ultimately, Simon is pondering and posing the spiritual questions of life and death in a musical form that is inviting, reflective and never religious in the conventional sense.  Perhaps it is musical offerings such as this that speaks intimately to people and is what they mean when they say they are spiritual and not religious?   It is a musical invitation that is simply and profoundly so beautiful.      Rev. Deborah J. Blanchard is the minister at First Baptist Church of Littleton, MA, and manager for blues guitarist and band, Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters.

And through the points of view of Grace, Sam, Isabelle, and Cole, the reader is thrown into another dimension of  the Wolves of Mercy Falls. We learn that things are not always as they appear, and sometimes they are. Steifvater takes a different approach and leaves Sam fighting and searching for a way to keep Grace with him, presenting a cliffhanger that fits smoothly into the world of waiting for Forever. What will be the fate of Grace and Sam? Can one live while the other survives?<br /><br />This series will appeal to all kinds of readers, but especially to those who have grown tired of supernatural novels. The author offers a fresh new idea in the world of the supernatural, an idea that has long been needed.
1416583432|1.0|I love dogs. I bought this book because I thought I would learn more about how a dog thinks. Well, I was wrong. I couldn't even finish the book. I skimmed entire chapters and finally just gave up. I thought this book would be a light, fun read and it's the complete opposite. For me, this book is an explanation of what a dog is as if you have never met a dog before. It contains long, boring explanations about dogs. I would sum this book up like this - it's  a text book for dog psychologists. Only they could enjoy this boring book.
0061711292|5.0|Sparks has created a layered novel with layered characters. Miss Jean Brodie, dedicated teacher to her \\"girls,\\" is in the prime of her life. The problem is she doesn't truly know what that means. She just knows it to be a fact, a fact that she pushes on her girls.<br /><br />A truth the reader will learn: it is not the prime of Brodie's life; it is the prime of her girls, a chosen circle of six. Her goal is to shape them into beautiful, educated young women in a time when girls were raised to be submissive. But can Miss Brodie survive her prime, and her girls?<br /><br />Fans of the role made famous by Maggie Smith will not be betrayed by the novel, a writing masterpiece. It is easy to get caught up in the language, but ultimately, it is the characters that drive the piece.
1423389387|4.0|I've never thought of myself as a huge high fantasy fan, but I read George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones books a few months back and got completely sucked into that genre. I cant get enough of it now. In response to all of the, \\" If you like that, you'll love this\\" or \\"Customers who bought --- also bought this\\" features on the Game of Thrones series product pages I requested the audio CD version of The Wise Mans Fear. I quickly realized that this was book 2 in a triology and not number 1 as I had originally thought, so I had to take the time to read book one, The Name of the Wind first. I'm not one who can start a trilogy in the middle or read out of order. Who does that? So I bought the first book and to speed things up (its a heck of a long book), I also downloaded the audio version from Audible.com.   I don't feel the need to rehash the plot here, others have already done that and much better than I could but, Wow, what a world, what a story. I just couldn't get enough. I was very happy to go straight to book two, The Wise Mans Fear. I again read the print version consecutively with listening to the audio. Otherwise I would have had to live in my car for a week. Again, no re-telling of the plot here. This review is of the audio version and I have specific things to say about that. It is very long, 35 cds, but there were times I wished it was longer and the time passed surprisingly fast. The narrator, Nick Podehl, the same for both books, is the wrong choice of reader in my opinion. It is billed as a performance by Nick Podehl but it is really more of a read aloud. He does'nt do a great job of using different voices for various characters, which at first made it difficult to keep track of everyone and he isn't a particularly gifted actor. I was constantly thinking of how he sould have delivered certain lines differently, with more feeling. It wasn't until I went to the print version that I was able to get a grip on the story. After that I didn't let his style getin the way of my enjoyment of the story but if I hadn't had the print version I may have stopped listening rather quickly which would have been a shame. To think what I would have missed out on.    So my advice regarding the audio version of this book is, use it as a supplement to the print or Kindle version or at least download it from Audible.com (also an Amazon company I believe) so you wont have to deal with 35 cd's in your car.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|My previous cases have been silicone, which unfortunately rips and stretches too easily.  This case uses some new plastic/rubber called TPU (don't ask me for technical specs) which is quite sturdier than silicone.    Does what it's supposed to do.  Can't complain.  Screen protector is standard fare, but it's nice to include one.    Recommended.  Just make sure you order directly from Amazon, not through a reseller, or you may get a knock-off.
B004WCTLNY|1.0|Vehicle for the story:<br />Supernatural beings that are representatives of God (or someone/thing similar), require wearing a hat or cap, and and use an ordinary door with doorknob to travel through space and time (and for thousands of years at that) in a physical body (God must have lost interest in the action-at-a-distance routine) with a book (to keep track of things because their memories didn't evolve) in order to effect human destiny is a bit too much (i.e. ludicrous).<br /><br />Story theme:<br />The movie is presented as a discourse between free will and consequently self-interest vs. the interests of any other living community (human or otherwise).  The protagonist (Damon) is given the choice of serving \\"the people\\" and even the environment (he's a solar cell advocate) or serving himself through his pursuit of the one he loves. At first the decision is made for him but then he's allowed to decide then the decision is made for him then he's allowed to decide. Or something like that!<br /><br />Mother Teresa:<br />I guess Mother Teresa shouldn't have followed God's suggestion to serve others before herself (at least as the movie would argue).
B000A6T262|4.0|First I'd like to begin by saying I can't remember seeing all the Next Generation episodes but I saw plenty. the one I remember most specifically was the one where Picard was assimilated into the Borg, pretty sweet. I've never been to a Star Trek convention either, I just like the movies, and how Williams Shatner talks with his head.<br /><br />I got this for an early Christmas gift. once I got to where I could watch them I watched all of them in a week since I had classes during the day. I enjoyed all the movies just as much as the first time I saw them. my favorites are \\"Wrath of Kahn\\", \\"search for Spock\\", \\"Voyage Home\\", \\"Generations\\" and \\"First Contact\\". Really I enjoyed the whole set just because I have all of the movies finally, some I enjoy more than others.<br /><br />If I had to choose one to watch over the rest it'd have to be Generations. The scene where the enterprise crashes is a super workout for your speakers! I saw this scene at an electronics shop in a laser disc and had to sit outside the room it was turned up so loud, but still, that's what? 5 minutes of the ship digging through earth at it's weight.<br /><br />I think the only bad thing about these movies that the battle sequences in space are not all that great and awesome. Obviously the First movies until we get to the \\"Undiscovered Country\\" were very awesome I thought because the makers only had large models so it looked more real. starting at the Country we've gotten into less action and more sort of sitting around on the ship or on some weird planet, but overall are good movies and have plenty of phaser and fist fights and such. Although all the special effects are very good there are just less of the space action in the later movies, except for Nemesis.<br /><br />I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure all the ones I got; we are talking about the set pictured; were 2-disc special editions and the Motion Picture is a special Director's version or something, I don't know why it's called that because I can't remember what was and wasn't in the original theatrical version if anything...<br /><br />I would recommend this set to any Trek fan that liked the movies, I don't know about the show so much, but like I said, the first movies are the best up until the Undiscovered country.asn't in the original theatrical version if anything...

B0049P1VHS|5.0|To start off, I am just gonna say straight out - I have never ever read the comic series. That said, I understanely d why people get upset when Hollywood changes something that they love. Heck, I've been angry about stuff they have changed in things. But I think this might be the exception to the rule. My mom and I love zombie movies, so when I heard about this series, I was estatic. I ordered it a few days after it came out and it came quickly. My mom and I watched the first episode that night. We were shocked, it was unlike anything we had ever seen before. The next day, I was reluctant to suggest watching more, even though after the inital shock, I wanted to know what was going to happen. So imagine my surprise when my mom asks if I want to watch some more of it. Turns out she wanted to watch more. We finished the rest of the season that day and are reluctantly, but eagerly, waiting for Season 2. Now my sister is even wanting to watch it, which cracks me up cause she hates any kind of zombie or monster stuff. The zombies are absolutely fabulous! Greg Nicotero is truly the master of zombies. The one thing I like the most about it is that while its ooh, scary zombies! there is also a greater underlying storyline. The cast is absolutly awesome, Andrew Lincoln is great as a the sherrif and Jon Bernthal is totally unlikable as Shane. What can I say, I have nothing but high reviews!
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I stopped into the old CBS Studio Building at 49 East 52nd Street in Manhattan recently. It housed the famous Columbia Studio B back in the day ~ not to be confused with Columbia Studio A on 7th Ave or Columbia 30th Street Studio (a.k.a. - the Church), in addition to Columbia Studio and RCA Studio B both in Nashville. Sadly, it now occupies Rx drugs and drug store essentials, instead of state of the art studio gear, bustling with prolific singer-songwriters and gifted musicians, audio engineers, and producers. Yes, you heard me right. Alas, it is now a drug store/pharmacy.    I walked up one flight of stairs, just as you enter the store, to the second floor. Allowing myself a few moments of stillness, I drifted off. I was the only person on that second story floor, as I found myself staring at some bottles of aspirin on shelves, subsequently closing my eyes to reflect on what it must have been like when Art was cutting vocal tracks to Bridge in the very same room in which I was standing - perhaps even the same spot, for all I knew. I copped a couple of photos with my point and shoot camera while no one else was present. I couldn't believe I was daring to the extent that I would be snatching photos of a room inside a retail store without authorization, let alone inside a drug store. I figured, if anyone were to ask what I was doing, I would have explained my deference for a room with such a reverent musical history. Time and space are such a weird amalgamation, especially when they are intertwined into what becomes a form of bitter destiny.     Dylan did his New Morning album in that very room. Janis Joplin cut Piece of My Heart and McCartney recorded tracks to Ram there, too. Anyway, getting back to S&G and that room, I was mesmerized as time stood still for that fleeting moment, yet eluded me when I contemplated; here I am...am I the only living boy in New York? Standing alone, unto myself, I let in that there had once been a recording studio here, and not just anyordinary recording studio ~ but a studio where a beautiful piano ricocheted off great and perfect walls, capsulating an instance of beauty into celestial infinity, as Bridge Over Troubled Water would be captured for all time.  Surreal does not suffice what I was feeling. It was complete absurdity!     \\"What have we become and where has our music taken us?\\" I wondered. I came to the conclusion that this drug store symbolized our lost innocence; yet, in reality, I was standing inside myself, a time capsule that had been hurled into space against my will. This drug store is our metaphor, serving as a vehicle that has transitioned us to new horizons, lifted us to new heights, and transported us to new territory, sometimes to terrain we would prefer to not be, by way of new bridges, of which we can never return. What was once a miraculous song has now become defunct counterpoint to our youth, yet still relevant ~ or is it?  Only time will tell if we are still troubled and weary, or are finally at rest.      As I reluctantly left the store, I thanked God that at least we still have this perpetual music that will reign absolute, even if we no longer have each other.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|RED was a pretty good movie. My husband likes Bruce Willis, so I picked this one up for him to watch. Besides Bruce Willis, there are a few other great stars who made this a fun, action packed movie. It's a PG13, so really, not much in the way of bad language. Make some popcorn and enjoy Bruce Willis in RED, my husband and I did!
1416972242|3.0|After the horrible experience I had with the City of Bones audio book, I was dreading City of Ashes. As I have said before, the reader didn't do much to enhance the story. But lucky for me, City of Ashes has a different reader, one who does a much better job.<br /><br />Even with a new reader, I'm still not a huge fan of this series. Clary seems to whinny, she has no idea what she's doing but she always insists on going out and being in the middle of the action. She just seems so stupid to me. If it wasn't for Jace and the other Shadowhunters, she would have died first action scene in the first book.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on her guilt and how she constantly blames herself for everything that's happened. I just want to scream in her face and shake her until she understands that everything would have happened that way anyway, no matter what she did. I know that she is going to have a certain amount of guilt which is natural, but her's is just blown out of proportion. For some reason, Clary just really annoys me a lot. But I like the other characters in the book, especially Alec, Isabel and Magnus. I would be a lot happier if Isabel was the main character.<br /><br />After saying all that, the plot of the story still interests me and curiosity makes me still want to know how the series is going to end. It was much better than City of Bones because the story was able to develop more and Cassandra Clare was able to get into the meat of the plot. There's just something fishy about who Jace and Clary are and whether or not they're truly related. There are also many mysterious facets that have yet to be explored that could be very entertaining if done the right way. I can feel that there is some big revelation that is yet to come in the next two books. And because I want to know, I will most likely listen to them, as well.<br /><br />Fans of the Mortal Instruments series will most likely not enjoy this review. But that's not saying that I'm completely opposed to Cassandra Clare. I very much enjoyed Clockwork Angel and I'm eagerly anticipating Clockwork Prince. I know the stories are somewhat the same, but I just really like the steampunk setting of the Infernal Devices series. So, in my closing statement: to each his own!much enjoyed Clockwork Angel and I'm eagerly anticipating Clockwork Prince.

B003L77GRO|5.0|Um, ok, I love Dexter and have been watching the mailbox like a nut, waiting for it to come, since I paid for 2-day shipping, 4 days ago! I never noticed it doesn't come out til August!!! lol-Darn it; my kids and I were looking forward to seeing it! By far the best show and premise on TV. All the actors are perfect in their roles. I am, however, happy they got rid of Rita; good actress, yes, but her character was starting to get on my nerves, way too needy...the way she died was also an excellent twist. John Lithgow was perfectly creepy, and it is by far his best role yet. Looking forward to seeing Dexter being a single dad and serial killer combo. Bummer I have to wait til August, but I know it will be well worth the wait.
1416955070|2.0|I have read so much about this book on the blogs until the point of \\"I need to get this book to find out what everyone is raving about!\\" The opportunity arose when I was driving my car from Virginia to California and I decided to get the audio book version. I had only listened to one audio book before City of Bones and I really enjoyed the experience. Knowing I would have a lot of listening time on my hands, I also got the City of Ashes audio book.<br /><br />Listening to an audio book and reading a physical book are two very different experiences and can dramatically shape your opinion of the book depending on the reader. Physically reading a book allows the reader to make their own voices in their head and gives them time to imagine the setting, the tone and the pace. But when an audio book, all that is determined by the reader.<br /><br />City of Bones audio book has a terrible reader. She made all the girl characters sound like they were wining and all the male characters sound too girly. She also didn't have much conviction behind her voice. When Clary was supposed to be screaming or yelling, she would hardly raise her voice. When there was action or someone was supposed to be out of breath, she talked the same way as the rest of the book. It was a very odd experience.<br /><br />I had already known what to expect of the story since I had read Clockwork Angel, so I already knew about the different types of creatures. They story was definitely exciting and there was a lot of action but because of the reader I had a hard time feeling the chemistry between Clary and Jace, not that I should really want to knowing how it ended. The end left me really wanting to know what was going to happen with Clary and Jace and if her mom would wake up again.<br /><br />Overall, I found City of Bones to be very addictive, constantly wanting to know what happened next. The story was very good, but as far as the audio book version goes, I would recommend that it's to be read instead of listened to.

He provokes new responses in relation to what is and what was. One  of my friends thinks Harris is naive but he isn't selling quick fixes.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|Lemonade Mouth is a very good movie. My daughter watches it over and over. The songs are very catchy and fun. I would recomend this movie for kids 7-18. Lemonade Mouth is one of the best Disney movies of 2011!
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I am a harry potter fan and even though I dont have a bluray player just yet, I thought why not start building my collection now?

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Extremely fun and addicting game. I had previously played it on the iPad at an Apple Store and I jumped on it when I found out it was coming out for Android phones for free through Amazon's app store app. Its a game that one must have in their library of game apps.
1593272774|4.0|This is not a step-by-step book for building fantastic models and machines. Rather, it illustrates clearly in a fundamental manner basic mechanical units which are essential to grasp if one is to gain proficiency for designing more sophisticated projects. Thus there are useful illustrations for transferring motion (e.g. gearing down, changing axis of rotation, simple levers, etc.). Personally I think this is a good book to have because it is hard to learn, in a formal manner, these concepts just by following lego model building instructions.     I guess you can take much more out of this if you have a technical and engineering background, so I would rate this book as not as suitable for very young kids (say below 8yrs).
0142000655|5.0|Spectacularly developed characters to go with the gorgeous writing one expects.  The story is one that takes place from the nineteenth century until the late nineteen teen years.  It evolves from a family in the east, the Trasks, a girl from near them, and the families, primarily the Hamiltons, who develop the Salinas Valley in California.  The characters vary from some impeccably honest and good souls to perhaps the most evil character this reader has ever encountered.  She's introduced in chapter 8, which ranks high on the list of creepiest things I've ever read.  The counterparts are terrific, for this reader Sam Hamilton's life and outlook and the wisdom, loyalty, patience, and goodness of Chinese man Lee, who begins in the story as a servant in the family that descends from the Trasks mentioned above.  Almost all the characters lean to one side or the other of the good/evil line, with some having very human elements of both, and with nearly all having internal demons they address by either choice or necessity.   In a way, ahead of his time, Steinbeck raises some interesting nature/nurture musings in his reader.  A fine, fine read, particularly if you enjoy novels of families over time.  This was my fourth Steinbeck, and I hugely look forward to more.  It's great.

B004XANKVO|5.0|First of all, this is a bag for your computer. Although the tag says you can put books in it, this is not a bag for cramming with textbooks and then putting your computer in, too. Which is a bit of a dilemma for college students, one of the major market, I would think, for this bag. However, if you're tech-folk and need a backpack for all your electronics, you couldn't do better. This bag looks extremely fashionable, feels very nice on you, is lightweight yet durable, and is just the right size: it's not bulky, you don't find it brushing against walls or doorframes. It's slim enough that it fits behind my back as well as my twelve-year-old daughter's. The organization and planning behind the pockets, zippers, and auxiliary attachments is truly worthy of industry-setting trends, standards, and, well, I'd say it's the one to beat. There's lots of thin, soft, yet protective padding. The only drawbacks are: 1) water-resistant, of course, doesn't mean waterproof, a lesson I learned sadly with a bag I had a few years back when I was caught in a sudden downpour that saturated my bag, and 2) the zippers have clear-blue plastic covers that I'm not sure will stand the test of time. My chidlren's Toshiba 14 1/2 inch computer fit perfectly with room to spare, and, were I to use this to carry my tiny 10 inch Acer in, I'd have room for, I don't know, my television, too. With the Toshiba computers in it, there is more than enough room for power cord, mouse, external hard drives, thumb drives, a change of clothes (seriously; we rolled up a rain jacket, shirt, pants, and sundries and put them in the small pocket at the bottom of the bag), and, well, things we haven't thought of yet. As to price: this retails for about $130; if I were to ever spend this much on a bag, I'd feel much better about it after seeing this one. I've spent a hundred for bags of much less quality, and the worse thing that can happen is to buy a bag for seventy to a hundred bucks and having something break (which I've gone through twice). This is the cadillac computer-protection bag.ch I've gone through twice). This is the cadillac computer-protection bag.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Overall, Battle: LA won't go down as one of the best alien invasion movies, but it will be one of my favorites.  There are fair criticisms of character stereotypes, recycled alien design, unoriginal plot, etc.  Even with all of that, this film wins me over with it's simple and possible truthful account of how a squad of Marines would handle an alien invasion.<br /><br />The audience expectations for alien invasion movies typically value the film based on the WOW factor.  How unique is the alien design?  How cool and unusual are their weapons and ships?  With all these expectations, I'd imagine people would be rather let down by the idea of simple alien life forms.  The aliens are quite typical for today's standards, but I overlook this because it's the characters journey through the battle that matters most.<br /><br />Other criticism is the lack of bird's eye view of the invasion as a whole.  The aliens reach major coastal cities around the world and viewers may feel like they are stuck in a box and not seeing the bigger picture.  Let me make this clear...  The movie is called `Battle: LA', and THAT is the plot.<br /><br />While fans enjoy the action sequences, the reason I enjoy the movie is the characters.  For example, Eckhart does an outstanding job portraying the washed up Staff Sergeant Nantz.  Twenty years of service and a closet full of skeletons.  His story is realistic and may not go well with viewers that have no understanding of the military.  Nantz makes the decision to retire, which was not an easy decision.  For those that know men and women that have spent 20 years in active service understand how hard this can be.  I am paraphrasing, but there is a scene where Nantz has received his signed documents for retirement, he says `This is all I know'.  Basically saying, \\"This is all that I am.\\"  I seem to take in more about his character the further the story goes.  It seems to resonate with me more than others.<br /><br />My last comment has to do with the plot.  The original mission for these Marines was to locate civilians and get them back to the FOB.  While this is happening, you start to see the second mission unfold.  In war, I tend to find that you need lady luck on your side.  There are unexplainable things that happen in a battle, but you never question it at the time.  The film made me feel like I was right there in the thick of it and realizing the same conclusion as Nantz does.  There are no coincidences in life, just missed opportunities.  When the audience comes up with a million reasons why the small band of Marines couldn't have successfully crossed behind enemy lines and infiltrated the alien's intel station, I say you only need to come up with one reason on how they could.for these Marines was to locate civilians and get them back to the FOB.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|The Behringer Xenyx 802 is a very nice control board for the price.  It came promptly, and included a very nice manual in several languages.  I had enough background knowledge to use this product out of the box, but for somebody who didn't, the manual could very easily explain it to them quickly and have them mixing in no time.  The only real thing I noticed quickly is that the light signifying that it is on is obnoxiously bright, to the point where it is distracting.  This was an easy fix, I taped a little piece of lighting gel over it and got it to a point where I liked it.  I played with the mixing functions a little bit using several techniques and my results are recorded below:<br /><br />The first test of this unit was simply trying it out with a few different medium quality speakers and seeing how it sounded.  I attached an Mp3 player for input and hooked up several bases for output.  Most of the controls worked flawlessly, the board didn't seem to be broken in any way.  Distortion was pretty high, I messed with the gain a bit, and played with the various volumes and EQs until I got it how I liked.  This would have been a bigger problem if I had been somebody whom had never operated a mixer before, it would've taken a lot longer to fix this using only the manual.  The EQs worked nicely, the middle functioned particularly well, bass caused some distortion but nothing annoying; however, treble wasn't excellent, it made the high frequency audio sound a tad metallic and cut off some at the top.<br /><br />My second test was also with an Mp3 player as input, but this time I used several different types of headphones as output.  Distortion was higher this time, and with some songs I could not completely eliminate it.  That said, the control room function worked nicely with a little less distortion, and I'm not quite sure why I would want headphones on one of the mains.  The EQs did little to eliminate this distortion, as did the gain, but I could limit it using thevarious volumes.<br /><br />My third test involved using the mixer as if it were mixing for an actual band.  I had a Shure Sm58 wired on input 1, a Crown \\"Floor Mic\\" on input 2, a bass guitar and (cheap) electric guitar on input 3/4 , and a keyboard on input 5/6.  The whole 3/4 and 5/6 inputs bugged me, as it really shouldn't have been considered 6 input.  I ended up plugging the guitars and keyboards into the double amps because the doubles didn't have XLR which the microphones needed.  That said, phantom power worked like a charm and the floor mic worked nicely.  Distortion was considerably lower with my voice as the input, and I was unable to hit any notes high enough to sound bad (well...bad in comparison to my normal voice.)  The Bass/guitar match up worked nicely, as the bass EQ barely affected the guitar and the treble EQ affected the bass.  This allowed me some level of individuality, but not as much as I would have liked.  Distortion was higher in both of the actual instruments in comparison to the microphones, but not in comparison to the mp3 players.  This pleased me a little bit, but the lack of individual controls makes me wonder whether setting up this board to run a band would be a good idea.<br /><br />My final test involved plugging it in to a full audio system in a real venue, and seeing how it sounded there.  I tried out several different inputs and outputs, including but not limited to floor mics, sm58s (wired and otherwise), sm57s, a computer, and an mp3 player.  The problems were approximately the same; however, with high power amplifiers I didn't need to use the amplification included in the board at all.  Doing this, distortion was cut out almost completely.<br /><br />So should you buy this board?  That depends.  Based on the facts that the problems I had with distortion varied based on what else was connected, I would theorize that it probably wasn't the consoles fault.  Personally, if I could do it all over again, I would try and find something that has a few more EQs and a higher level of individual control.  I also would enjoy a slider rather than a knob for volume, but that's just nit picking.  One interesting thing to take notice of is the fact that while the boards in this line directly above this one have more inputs, they only have EQs on the first 2, so this board is arguably better than the ones above it.  This control board is definitely worth the price for educational purposes, and it could possibly be good for small bands that want their own boards, starting Deejays, low budget community theaters, etc.  This thing would be particularly good for places that mostly do talking, like churches.  But if you need to do any recording, or you're a group that does music but CAN afford a higher quality board, than this may not be the board for you.<br /><br />Other features that generally bugged me:<br />-No EQ bypass: a lot of mixers have a button that chooses whether or not to apply EQ, as it isn't desirable in all scenarios, and even putting all of the nobs at exact middle is subjective and reliant on the fact that the EQ is calibrated perfectly.<br /><br />-Digital I/O is USB.  At the time of this board's release, Firewire is faster than USB with data transfers, and because of this it has been fairly widely adopted in pro sound world.  (To all of you who argue that USB 2.0 is faster than Firewire400, with real world testing Firewire400 outperforms USB 2.0 in spite of having a lower theoretical rate)<br /><br />Note:<br />I did not try out the effects options for this board.  That really is not my area of expertise, but sometime in the future I do plan on updating this review with information on that.  This would be when I have access to a dedicated FX controller, or when I next try it using Virtual DJ with my computer.
B0009VBTA0|5.0|I was a complete vinyl audiophile freak in the '70s and '80s, and first saw this in a pile of demo records at a local high-end audio store. The cover was so beguiling that I had them put it on their million-dollar tube set-up, and whoa! The glistening, shimmering music was made even more sublime by the incredible binaural production effects. I was captivated, bought the album along with Behind The Gardens, and still listen to them today with much pleasure.<br /><br />I've enjoyed almost every AW recordings since then, and while he's occasionally a bit twee, sounding New Agey slick and limp at his worst, his catalog is for the most part excellent (and he was doing some of the best New Age music before it had a name). Vollenweider has since this early album played with various vocalists and many styles of musicians, but Caverna still reigns supreme for those who want to hear his electric harp work its magic as unadorned and purely as possible.<br /><br />Every track here has a lovely melody, which is his forte. If you love melody married to sweet harmonic lushness, Vollenweider is your guy and this is the place to start. Then Gardens, Air, and many others, along with the fine 2 cd live album which covers much of his best stuff, a fine sampler.<br /><br />But it's his early productions that still sound and feel best to me, Caverna above all. The opening little laughter bit with his wife, their coughing (a subtle recommendation to enhance the listening experience as you see fit), and then the glorious unfolding of the 3D soundstage into that inimitable harp soundscape that Andreas creates so perfectly. And make sure to listen to Caverna a few times on good headphones; this stuff is like Pink Floyd if Roger Waters was in a really good mood. CM is also a perfect album to play in thick traffic; it'll calm you down and wrap you in a tranquil cocoon of warm sound that will float your stress away. You might even let that guy cut in front of you, and with a smile!<br /><br />This cd remaster is very nicely done; compared to the vinyl, it's less three-dimensional and not quite as warm, but still lovely, and the bonus tracks are pleasant. If you've never heard AW, or are looking for the best place to start, this or the live album are perfect, as is Gardens. They verge on cheesy at moments, but always pull back into the highest category of easy listening, in the best sense. I recall a long-ago musical journey listening to Ella's Cole Porter Songbook, then the first Black Sabbath album, then Caverna, then Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key Of Life, then Bill Evans with Jim Hall on Undercurrent, and Caverna held up perfectly along with those other four peerless records, no mean feat. It's all music, after all, and the quality comes from the consciousness and emotional intention of the musician, whatever the genre. AW has plenty of both, and at a very high level in a very laid back fashion.<br /><br />I recently checked out his website and was happy to see that he has made many fine humanitarian efforts, including protesting various wars while many were waving the flag for more violence and hate. If ever there was truly peaceful, loving music, this is it, and it's no wonder that its creator is a spokesman for peace. I salute you for that, Andreas, and thank you for many many hours of blissful relaxation and re-creation.<br /><br />If you're looking for beautifully produced, harmonically-rich music that will slow you down and put a sweet smile on your face, you can't do much better than Caverna Magica.one; compared to the vinyl, it's less three-dimensional and not quite as warm, but still lovely, and the bonus tracks are pleasant.

0805047905|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3JALW3SHZ6B5]]Bedtime Stories happen EVERY DAY!  You need to switch it up sometimes.  This was one of the books that influenced me when I was writing and illustrating [[ASIN:1461052858 Daddy Loves You]] for my daughter.
1439177783|5.0|I was captivated by this book.  Just for the sheer honesty of it and `covering it all'.  Mostly for her risk taking and ability to divulge - to share her secrets - her fearlessness in being able to  write:  yes I did this, I was that way, and now I am 'more' than that; I have done these things, I have feared change and not known what to expect - however  I have changed.    Ultimately, I liked the book because, more than the idea that she learned she was more than her looks - I'm assured she is certain she is more than her crazy behaviors (like we all hope to be!).        She didn't focus a lot on the social media focus on thinness - she made it clear that that was a part of it ... however the way her story's journalized - the obsessive compulsive aspects of some behavior in general can be experienced by all.  Personally, I liked the `tale' the way it was told. There are tons of books on recovery. I can see how it might be used as a `how-to' book - however, I think that depends on the hands it lands in - and with most, it will probably have more impact as a cautionary tale.      Lastly, I have to say I cried on the last page.  The quote sums it up.  And the reason I can say this and not have it ruin the book - is I don't think the quote would mean as much if the whole story isn't read.  So glad for the happy ending!

0061784788|3.0|It seems that some reviewers are writing reviews before actually reading the book. Most of these are based on moral stands about the Kindle price of the book.<br /><br />All that aside, I ordered this book in hardback, might as well since it was cheaper (never thought I would say that).<br /><br />Rollins does here what he has done with the last couple Sigma Force novels, he splits up the force between teams being run by Painter Crowe, the director of Sigma and Grayson Pierce, one of the main operatives. Both are working toward the same goal, trying to figure out what an archaological discovery in the mountains of Utah means beyond its historical value.<br /><br />I scored this book three stars not because of any disagreement about the pricing but because the splitting of the Sigma Force resources really taps the energy of the story. There are so many neat things here that just don't get the attention they deserve because the story has to jump to the next team for the story to continue, the improbable spur of the moment search of Fort Knox immmediately comes to mind as an example. With a little more time and development, this aspect could have been a really fascinating addition to the story. As it is it become little more than a side note along the shoot em up storyline.<br /><br />Keep in mind that three stars means I think the book is \\"OK\\". Not bad by any stretch of the imagination but lacking in some key points. I have read the other Sigma novels and may very well read any further ones; this one is just a little weak. With summer arriving, I think this book would make a great beach read or one to read at the campsite.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|What can I say, I have been a fan since I was 12 yrs old and Predator dropped in the movie theaters.  I could remember how i loved this movie from the very first time I viewed it.  I also liked Predator 2 cause im the type of person who always wonders what would happen if you put a movie like this into a urban scenerio.  I liked the movie for its time but as I got older part 2 lost some of its luster.  Well lets fast forward to 2010 and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  I read all of the negative reviews and almost passed up on buying this movie.  Well I got the movie and i have to say this Predator was great.  I [[ASIN:B0040YFR1Y Predators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]liked the blood feud between the different Predators.  I think i could have done without the Lawrence Fishburne character but hey, the rest of the movie did it for me, from the hounds from hell to all of the guys and girl being hunted, i got it they were not choir boys but were the best at what they did on earth, KILL and this is the reason why they were choosen to be hunted.  No problem with that.  Over all the movie was great and I really enjoyed it.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Great movie for sure, but there are a few scenes that will cause people who cannot handle gore to shield their eyes. This is understandable due to the fact that this film is based around the Russian mafia. Wonderfully shot, amazing cast, and great storyline!
B001OQCV6K|1.0|If I would have known Guy Ritchie directed this movie, I wouldn't have bought it because, typically I don't like his movies. And Sherlock Holmes is no exception! After the first 30 minutes, I couldn't tolerate it any longer. Well I am going to make this review very brief--- It's awful!
030746363X|5.0|I recommend this to anyone SERIOUS about transforming their body.  Find out why you´ve been wasting time with diets and workouts.
0062060554|3.0|A little repetitive, especially in the beginning, but the ending is worth it. For this writer's first novel i applaud it.. i would get his next after this.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|This was my first DOTM figure and I was very skeptical about them due to these apparently being much smaller than previous movie toys. Fortunately, deluxes don't suffer as much from this as much as voyagers. I've got to say that I was very impressed with this Bumblebee. His vehicle and robot modes are both great (however there is a bit of kibble on his back), and the transformation is simple enough.  One of the new features of this toy line are the Mechtech weapons. This toy comes with a pretty cool gun that I think would better suit Optimus Prime. It attaches to either arm in robot mode, the roof in vehicle mode, or you can convert into \\"Stealth Force\\" mode by lifting up the very back and very front of the top of car mode to reveal two sculpted missle launchers and two hidden Mechtech ports (warning: if you put to much preasure putting in the Mechtech guns in these two ports, they may crack) I really don't like the gun on the roof, so I normally just leave it off in vehicle mode. Also, if you own the original movie Bumblebee that transforms into the 70's Camaro, than you can use the two pistols from that as Mechtech guns that look really nice on this figure. Overall, this is a great DOTM figure and I'm looking forward to the future of this line and the movie itself.

0920668372|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2I9U75IA30E31]]I liked the idea of this one so much, but I didn't like the illustrations, and as a Dad it didn't work for me, so it was one of the books that inspired me to write and illustrate \\"[[ASIN:1461052858 Daddy Loves You]]\\" for my daughter.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is awesome, you can record podcast, and its great built app. I will recommend over the other radio apps.
B004ISVH5W|5.0|I am a huge fan of Richard Ashcroft..This is a brilliant CD.  I feel some spiritual overtones in this CD and that makes it even more awesome.  All the songs are so great and the lyrics draw you in over and over.  It's different and I love it!  Can't wait for more from Richard......
0393338827|3.0|I'm a fan of Michael Lewis' books.  This one was good, but lacked a lot of the drama the came with the sub-prime crisis.  Lewis focused his book on a few groups of investors and how they rode the crisis from beginning to end.  It was entertaining and I enjoyed it.  I understand trying to tell the story through a few of the character that took part in the trade.  But the events regarding the implosion of Lehman and Bear Sterns could have and should have been an exciting part of the story. Yet, in The Big Short, the demise of the two firms and all the maneuvering that occurred at the Fed and other Wall Street firms was just light back story.  I think Lewis missed a big part of the story and drama that occurred.  I enjoyed the book, but was left a little disappointed.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|Battle Los Angeles is a thoroughly fun action film.  If you felt The King's Speech could have used more .50 cal guns blasting then this is the film for you.  It takes the Marines from Aliens and sticks them behind enemy lines, with a nice nod to Assault On Precinct 13.      If this film had been released in 1981 with John Carpenter as the director it would now be considered a classic of action suspense cinema.  It's the kind of film that finds its audience on DVD, just as Alien, Predator, Commando and Terminator did back in the day.      Battle Los Angeles would be perfect at the drive in a double feature with Escape From New York or Total Recall.
0307454541|1.0|I read books because I love authors who toy with language in novel ways (Nabokov), who create and explore unsettingly real characters (Mary Gaitskill's first book of short stories), or who are simply interesting to spend time with because of their wit and cleverness (David Sedaris, jim knipfel, jonathan ames).  This novel has none of that.<br /><br />Paragraphs are long and dense.  The sentence construction is never ever lyrical or fresh in any way.  Word choices are consistently mundane.  I suspect that this isn't just a problem with the translation.<br /><br />Statistics beginning each chapter seem intended to comment on real domestic abuse of women in northern Europe.  But then the sexual abuse in the story is almost comical in its outrageous nature; it seems stolen from a low-budget, insincere attempt at a \\"deviant\\" porn movie plot, not an exploration of the domestic abuse of real women and the real consequences on women and society.<br /><br />The protagonist is a cardboard cutout who will obviously get pushed from one novel of the series to the next without ever growing as a character.  Oh, and apparently every woman wants to have sex with the man, although it is not at all clear what they might see in him.  He certainly isn't particularly interesting for the reader.<br /><br />The portrayal of the female victim/heroine character seems blatantly manipulative of the reader.  She is petite, devastatingly pretty and intelligent, introspective, creative, and motivated.  But no one in the world cares about her.  Except for the reader who must be titillated by her or won't make it through the book.<br /><br />I consider myself a patient reader and have enjoyed other mystery novels with plots that unfold slowly through tedious research.  Characters and writing aside, the mystery plot isn't bad.  And the writing, although leaden, certainly isn't as mechanically broken and squeaky as a Dan Brown novel.  But ultimately I want more out of a novel than this.  I have discussed my criticisms with people who enjoyed this book, and they don't try to defend the book.  Instead they tell me I am looking at it too closely.  If this were a poorly constructed house, no one would want to live in it.  If this were a poorly tailored suit, no one would wear it.  I can't figure out why people are willing to spend time with this novel and recommend it to others.  I don't recommend this.ed this book, and they don't try to defend the book.

B004LUS390|1.0|I bought this app on my itouch and it works very smoothly. Now I have it on my Android 2.2 pad but it turns out not working well at all. Once I open the tool circle, it takes about one minute to show up. When I select a tool, the app doesn't respond at all. I am quite disappointed with it.
B004G6009U|5.0|This movie is great. It has a great mix of action, comedy, and vocals. It felt like I was back in my childhood watching the The Lion King, Robin Hood, The Jungle Book, etc. If you have children, perfect movie to watch with them. Feels like one of those classic Disney films. Definitely worth buying for all ages.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|First, I would probably normally give this movie 4 stars, but since so many idiots are giving it 1 star, I have to counteract them with a perfect 5 stars.    OK, this is a good movie. It has good flow and decent character development given the restrictions of the theme of the movie. A lot of the characters die early, so they don't need a lot of development (sad to say). The actors act like real Marines. What you hear them say is what Marines say (I was one- active duty 1993-1997, by the way not all Marines drop the f-bomb every other word!).    Some say the movie is full of cliches...I don't see it. I wanted an action film with Marines, not a \\"film\\". That is what this movie is. Others claim the special effects are bad...I don't get it. You see the movie as the Marines do. Things are happening fast. No, you don't see total close-ups of the aliens for this reason. Others claim the shaking camera is annoying. I loved it. You are following a squad of Marines in urban combat against aliens in LA...things are rough.    In closing, watch the movie for yourself. If you have a pulse, an imagination, and a heart you'll enjoy the ride.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is amazing, you can search anything food items, maps, conversions etc. I recently had to convert kilo to pounds and it did it for me!! This app comes in handy specially when trying to figure out for example how much fiber an avocado has? Just search avocado and it will tell you the national facts! No annoying web searches needed if you have this app. Think you know how much fiber an avocado has? Search and you will be surprised how much!!!
B0001MLMKY|5.0|I bought the standard Swatch to replace one I have had for about 15 years.  Since the critics sometimes questioned the band, I kept the old Swatch for it's band.  Great price - still an excellent every-day watch.  It was about the same price as the \\"tax free\\" price in an England airport.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Linger was a great sequel to shiver, it made me want to keep reading! It has some suspense in the middle of the book...but i wont tell you what the suspense is due to readers who have not read this book. Anyway, linger shows the love that Sam and Grace share together, and how Grace`s parents effect that. Sam not only has the problem of Grace`s parents but of the new wolves that have come....and waiting for them to change as the wheather starts to get warmer. This is a fantastic book that makes me want to read the 3rd book when it comes out!!
0553386794|5.0|Game of Thrones is an enticing read from start to finish. A series of, for the most part, complicated characters drives the intricate plot, which brings to light a number of themes, among them conflict, survival, love, revenge, and the fear of the unknown.<br /><br />The Starks are an old and noble household, proud to hold the gods of the First Men. Their sacred lands are home to the Weirwoods, trees with effigies carved into their faces. We see both the patriarch Eddard Stark and his eldest son Robb seek the knowledge of the gods as they seek understanding in uncertain times.<br /><br />Winter is Coming is the declaration of the Stark household, and the truth of these words becomes manifest in the fabled end of \\"summer\\" which has lasted nearly nine years. The Citadel of the new faith that binds the Seven Kingdoms of the world promises bitter cold, all while old feuds are rekindled.<br /><br />Cersei Lannister has married Eddard's old friend, Robert, who now sits upon the iron throne, solidifying power for the Lannisters, whose quest for power is unmatched. Meanwhile, the heir of the king her brother Jaime slew threatens war from beyond the great sea.<br /><br />The struggle for power is complicated by myriad casualties, unlikely alliances, and the whisper of winter-and the perils it brings with it. The defenders of the Wall have always managed to keep the world safe, even when recruits and supplies were hard to come by. But what will become of the realm when a new threat beyond the wall claims steadfast rangers with chilling ease? Eddard Stark's bastard son Jon Snow takes the black because he feels he has no other reputable option, but when his beloved uncle Benjen vanishes in the night, he becomes determined to find him-at any cost. Embattled by a continued investment in events beyond the Wall, Jon is as torn as most of the other characters in Martin's masterpiece.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire is a tribute to humanity: its lighter side, its darker side, and the gray area between where most of us are content to dwell.e content to dwell.

0307913090|5.0|Finished listening and loved every minute of this audio.  A good reader makes or breaks an audio book, and this reader has just enough accent to make the work feel authenic and still be perfectly understandable to an American audience.  Would highly recommend this work to anyone who loves fantasy or even to historical romance readers.  This is a historical with teeth, and just enough magic to make it interesting.  Can't wait for the reissue of other titles in this series to reappear in audio.  I know there are down loads available, but I want CD's.
B001LL9YP4|5.0|I'm a fan of Mark Harmon anyway and pairing him up with Sean Connery and Meg Ryan was exquisite. Great plot, murder is always a good plot, and Meg Ryan as Harmon's love interest. I do love when Harmon plays a hero, like LeRoy Jethro Gibbs in NCIS. I always thought Harmon would do well in a TV series.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|It was absolutely amazing how they could give a little robot emotions.  We have watched this movie over and over again.
0399230033|1.0|I bought this book because it was on a list of best board books for toddlers, but there is very little to the story.  The illustrations are great, but as far as I am concerned turning the pages in silence is not very exciting for a wiggly 2 year old boy.  Save your money and buy a book like \\"I love you stinky face\\" or \\"goodnight moon\\".  Those books have great pictures and words on every page!
0811870413|2.0|I'm sorry, but this is going to be the lowest rating I've ever given an item sold by Amazon, especially for an item that most people seem to like --- a lot. I'm glad I was able to borrow this book from our local library. I am downgrading Tartine Bread because:<br /><br />Minus one star for fluff: C'mon, it's a 304 page book. I thought it was about how to make bread something like that sold at a famous bakery in San Francisco. But the bread making instructions start on page 42 and end on page 171 - that's 129 pages, or slightly more than a third of the book. The beginning of the book is the author's adult biography, and the end is something called \\"Days-old Bread\\" which is mostly recipes for sandwiches (admittedly made of bread), some soups and salads (which have some croutons on them - made of bread), affogato and involtini (which are made with bread crumbs, of course). They go further afield with a recipe for jam and one for pickled sardines! Do you like pickled sardines? Ever eaten them? Do you live in a fishing port town where you can get really fresh sardines to pickle? Do you expect and WANT recipes like this in your \\"bread\\" book? There are at least 20 full page photos and drawing in this book, as well as numerous smaller ones, that have nothing to do with making bread. As I said, there is way too much fluff here.<br /><br />Minus one star for missing captions: There are a lot of photos and some artwork in this book. This would usually be a good thing, but, unfortunately, none of them are identified with captions - not a single one! So there is what could have been a great set of 35 photos showing us how to handle \\"modern\\" very soft high-hydration dough from the \\"bulk fermentation\\" stage until it is in the screaming hot cast iron dutch oven and has been scored before covering and baking. He uses a sequence of 18 photos showing the shaping of baguettes and later 24 photos non stop preparing croissants!  Each of these sets would have been so much better with captions but the editor either got really lazy or foolishly decided to make this \\"style\\" or \\"design\\" statement (no captions) that ruins the book for me.<br /><br />Minus one star for wasting materials: The author buys flour in 50 pound sacks - by the pallet, probably. Where we live, \\"King Arthur\\" or \\"Bob's Red Mill\\" flours cost about a dollar a pound. The author would have us start to make a \\"starter\\" (used in all the recipes) with 5 pounds of flour (a bit at a time, over several days), hoping it will produce a leaven (sort of like sourdough starter) that can be used for our bread. Towards the end, he would have us \\"discard all but 1 tablespoon of the mature starter\\"!!!  Then he sets up for his basic recipe for \\"country bread\\" using a kilogram of flour. (All his recipes use a kilo of flour.) My wife and I are empty nesters now, so we go through one or maybe two loaves of bread a week. To my mind, the quantities of materials used by this author are not at all home baker friendly.<br /><br />This could have been a good, even GREAT book, but the editing sucks so bad that outer space has become a vacuum. I highly recommend that you borrow it from your library or browse it at a brick & mortar store while sipping a cup of coffee or tea before making your purchase decision. I know, for sure, that I will not be buying or recommending this edition of Tartine Bread.either got really lazy or foolishly decided to make this \\"style\\" or \\"design\\" statement (no captions) that ruins the book for me.

B004SEUJAA|5.0|Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a period piece with modern execution. From the standpoint of the story and cast, Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is the ultimate star of Master and Commander. He conveys an authenticity and charisma that few actors currently possess, which allows him to pull off the Aubrey role so authoritatively.  Richard King was brought on board by director Peter Weir as \\"sound designer\\". His passion and technical expertise in audio engineering make the film a powerhouse cinematic experience, transporting viewers from their seats to a place onboard the British Navy ship, Surprise, off the coast of South America almost 200 years ago. More than any other aspect of the film, the realism and immersive quality of the audio puts the audience in the middle of the action. King won the Academy Award of Merit for Best Sound Editing for his work on Master and Commander. It was very well deserved, and the DTS-HD MA encode on the BD fully pays off King's fantastic sonic achievement.<br /><br />The audio is the real spark that ignites Master and Commander, bringing life to the action. This was apparent even in the DVD version, but the Blu-ray goes beyond the excellent sound quality of the earlier release. Listen to the battle scene at the beginning of the film when cannons fire, the projectiles rip through the air and slam into the hull of the Surprise, splintering the wood, sending men and debris flying. Modern audio design involves a blend of sounds created in innovative ways. For example, the sound of a fist hitting someone's face is often created by recording a head of lettuce thrown onto a hard surface. Another excellent scene for evaluating the audio is as the Surprise chases the Acheron around Cape Horn. Here, the audio conveys the howling winds, torrential rain, creaking planks of the ship and the crashing waves. Rarely if ever have Blu-ray fans been treated to an audio mix with this combination of resolution and immersion. Even during quieter scenes, the audio quality is uncanny in its realism. Sonic cues like the sounds of water and footsteps lend good presence to the DTS HD MA track. The rich midrange during the Bach viola and cello pieces, as well as voices and gunshots have a strength and palpability rarely heard in home theater mixes.<br /><br />Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was one of the most commercially underappreciated movies of 2003, hands down. Thankfully, Fox didn't deliver a half-hearted DVD release...in fact, the overall quality of this 2-disc set really took me by surprise. Sporting a fantastic technical presentation, the high production values of Master and Commander really shine through, making this as close to reference quality as I've seen yet.<br /><br />It's a great film!!!ieter scenes, the audio quality is uncanny in its realism.

B004ULEEY8|5.0|I normally do not buy movies right when the come out on DVD but I rented this in netflix and loved it. I love the war movies and many sci-fi movies (ranging from Independence Day to Contact). This movie seems to be more of a \\"war\\" based film than the focusing on the scifi. Many people compare this to Hurt Locker but I disagree. It reminded me more of the opening scene for Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brother (its that type of action). The only difference is that there are pretty bad ass aliens to fight. I did like the fact that the aliens were not almighty powerful compared to the humans which was a cool concept in my opinion.<br /><br />I thought the SF were right on par with Transformers or any other modern CGI for that matter. I didn't see any glitches or anything like that.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes adrenaline for an entire movie.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's such a great surprise when you discover a new and well-written book - I've been a fan of horror movies my entire life and, along the way, developed a special love for zombies. While they aren't the most terrifying creatures of the genre, they're just realistic enough to stir up feelings of fear and panic. That's exactly what this book delivered and I enjoyed every page. Told from the perspective of people all over the world and from all different walks of life, this zombie apocalypse won't disappoint.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|How often has Stephen King been dismissed as 'just a horror writer'. In IT he shatters that misconception.    This is a wondrous exploration of childhood, where the expected elements of that magical time confront the deepest evil that minds can conjure. The terror in this tale only serves to heighten the innocence lost for these children, and it is all the more poignant as they, as adults, reach back to that time. In doing so they revisit the terror, but they also are given the chance to taste that innocence that was long ago shattered.    If you want to know the true depth of Stephen King's ability, read IT. You will be scared, but you will also be moved.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I was dissappointed with the fifth season. This year (6) is outstanding! From the family plot, the insights into serial killers, and especially the outstanding acting by the star and all the others. The details and suprise endings make every episode compelling from start to finish.
B000002G8H|3.0|The case was all broken up, the CD was ok, there is only one song on the CD that is any good.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|This movie wasn't outright terrible but once the visuals have settled in, this flick has little else to offer.  The concept of a reality that exists only in the character's minds is potentially interesting but despite the opportunity for depth and creativity, it ends up a mere vehicle to bring us to the over-the-top action sequences.  This is certainly not of the same caliber as 300 even if all the parts seem to be there.  The pacing is monotonous and the danger is fake.  I didn't feel that the characters were actually in a fight for their lives until an hour had passed and by then I'd already become a bit numb.<br /><br />The high points of the production are in the costumes and sets.  These factors alone might warrant watching this movie once.  In the end, I simply felt that I'd seen all this done better before, just not all in the same movie.  Nothing new and not enough done well.<br /><br />I expect to see this all over the place for years as the movie of choice for selling high definition television sets.  The density of the action and the stylistic direction are great a few minutes at a time.
0307477479|2.0|What is a pultizer prize winning book anyway?  A pitch perfect writer, Yes but not a story teller. All that came from my reading 75 pages and then popping to the end chapters with the gimmicks and white space and lack of consideration for a true page count. Lively cover, dull read.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I've been a fanboy of Green Lantern for as long as I can remember. They did an outstanding job on this with keeping very close to the comic story. The biggest difference I noticed was the way Hal is chosen for the ring. Other than that I would recommend this movie to any fellow fan and even those who are seeing it for the first time.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Being intrigued by the success John Locke has enjoyed, I read one of his books (Lethal People).  Not what I thought, nor did I like it (at all).  But then, I'm not part of his target audience.  This book, however, is to my liking.  I'm part of his target group.  After a quick reading of the book (as I do with all How-To books) I was surprised by the simplicity of Locke's method.       Love or hate John Locke's fiction books all you want, but this book is about his success, and him giving us his method.  Therefore, whatever genre or style one likes to write is not in question, rather how to market and sell oneself.    Do yourself a favour and buy \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!\\" I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to self-publish.
B003S898SG|4.0|I'm not a huge Angra fan (this is my first CD purchase), but I did enjoy this album. It's similar to firewind and other power metal acts, but Aqua has a distincive flow and smoothness you don't get with hyperactive metal acts like Dragonforce (though i love them too). Overall Aqua is very enjoyable to hear while it still quenches an audiophile's thirst for technical, powerful, and complex music.
B00338QENI|4.0|I found this book to be interesting not only because of the history of Ms. Lacks and her family, but also because of all the insight to how our tissue samples are treated once they leave our bodies.  Knowing this story has given me an appreciation for what Ms. Lacks' cells have contributed to our world, and it has also called to attention the fact that there are some legal and ethical issues that need to be addressed in the medical world even today.    In addition to the stories of the Lacks family there is a lot of information regarding medical practice and laws in this book.  At times it can seem a bit slow, but this information is key to understanding why everything with Ms. Lacks cells happened the way it did.    A very interesting read.  Definitely opened my eyes to some gray areas in the law, and I now think twice before signing anything at my doctor's office!
159448385X|5.0|I am completely convinced that Khaled Hosseini is a literary god!  I absolutely loved this book, I thought is was definitely as good as The Kite Runner.  If anything, I feel the main characters of this book were more developed than those of the Kite Runner.  I was completely sucked into the story from beginning to end and had a really hard time putting it down.  Upon finishing this book, I was left feeling completely thankful for my life and the things and people that I have in it.  The ending is beautiful and it just about made me cry.<br /><br />Just a note- for some reason I was under the impression that A Thousand Splendid Suns was a sequel to The Kite Runner--it in fact is not.

B004VUP8WK|1.0|I enjoy listening to Industrial, techno & i also like metal mixed into it. But with this album it was just thrown together without much thought or knowledge of other music out there. If you want real industrial metal go check out Samael! This is a Marilyn Manson, Static X ripoff. I even hear Meshuggah & 2 other bands in this underlying style of music.<br /><br />Can i ask WHY this album exists? There is no reason for this, especially with Killacop, Killacult or whatever it says in the beginning. I really hope MA listens to their fans & goes back to classic DM. If they choose to stick to this style at least try to make it sound good & not like every other band out there. I advise people to check out & do your research before buying this.<br /><br />NOT Recommended!
B000FC1IPO|3.0|Why do women set unrealistic expectations on themselves?  I'm a working mom, so could relate to a lot of this book, especially a small vignette about the challenges of being completely engorged with no time or place to pump.  However, I found myself unsympathetic to Kate.  While she was strong in her work life, she seemed completely cowed in her home life.  She seemed more concerned with creating a perfect package, such as distressing a pie crust to give the appropriate homemade look, then with the core role of motherhood.  The moments were I most empathized were the times when she finally turned her harried focus to her kids.  The end was very unsatisfying, since it seemed too tidily, happily ever after.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|fun, but after getting the paid version, I'm surprised that in place of ads, i now get commercials that lock up my phone when I refuse to watch them. WTF!  Amazon won't let me put this on the paid either. stick with getting the free version and use airplane mode.
0060558121|5.0|(spoiler alert)<br /><br />I admit it: this massive fantasy tome (which I actually bought) had been hibernating on the top of my bedroom dresser for months, biding its time until one day something would click at the base of my brain, I'd pick it up, ignore all the books I've checked out from the library, and hurl myself into Gaiman's sick, yet curiously refreshing, world.<br /><br />That day finally came after I started following @neilhimself on Twitter and was delighted to discover that he'd be giving a talk in Berkeley, my home town. That gave me about three weeks to read his 588-page opus, which I did with considerable gusto. I'd already read his novel closest to it in spirit, Anansi Boys, as well as Stardust and Coraline. These are all fine novels in their own right, but none of them quite measure up to American Gods in terms of scope and audacity.<br /><br />This is because American Gods, like the characters in the novel themselves, is literally all over the map. It's a noir fantasy with a main character named Shadow, who's an ex-con with a good heart and a tragically two-timing wife. It's a road novel. It's a whimsical collection of oddball stories, some gory, some just strange, reminiscent at times of a Coen Brothers movie. Its characters are streetwise yet otherworldly, comically stupid or incomprehensibly vicious. The most significant gods in the book's title come from Norse mythology, but deities of every ilk get thrown into the mythic melting pot brewing in middle America: well-known ones like Anansi the Spider from Africa (Mr. Nancy), Kali from India, Thoth the Bird-god and Anubis the Jackal-god from Egypt, and a few lesser-known ones like Bilquis, a.k.a. the Queen of Sheba. All these gods and goddesses are both mortal and immortal (don't argue, just go with it) and appear to be both human and meta-human. The main god that Shadow plays off is Mr. Wednesday, a.k.a. the Norse god Odin, who appears to be leading a contingent of Old World gods into battle against the new gods, i.e. Media, the CIA and Technical Boy. Of course it ain't that simple...<br /><br />Gaiman delays revealing why Shadow is involved in all this, so for a while the novel feels like a psychological journey (which it is) rather than an epic struggle. Meanwhile, lurking in the background is an unsolved disappearance of an innocent girl you just know will turn out ugly, and it does. In the meantime Gaiman wanders from the narrow narrative path now and then with little charming vignettes about immigrants to America who brought their gods with them. To his credit, Gaiman still manages to keep the epic on course through all this.<br /><br />Like a mystery writer, he throws all sorts of curveballs at the reader, working against expectations. He toys with the Good vs. Evil trope, with a Star Wars-esque moment when Shadow discovers who his real father is--and he ain't necessarily the White Hat we'd been led to expect. Shadow's wife returns from the dead as a vengeful zombie, rescuing her husband from a pair of thugs in an apparent act of restitution--or is it? Ultimately Shadow redeems himself after surviving nine days hanging Odin-like from a tree, defusing the gathering storm of the impending clash of gods, and exposing a serial killer. In the end, after he meets his dead father while vacationing in Reykjavik, he flips a coin and wanders off, not bothering to see which side the coin lands on. Shadow has moved beyond gods, has no home, and is probably angling for a book deal. OK, maybe that was a little snide of me...<br /><br />In sum: American Gods is entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking, sometimes head-scratching, but except for a few too many hyperbolic storm references that feel a bit too much drawn from the world of pulp fiction and comic books, it makes for a great read.Media, the CIA and Technical Boy.

0671027344|4.0|I purchased this book because everyone else i know has read it and said it was their favorite book. I was not sure what to expect, but it really was quite good. If you are high school student who has struggled at all, or if you are an adult who remembers struggling through high school, or if you have experienced trauma in your life, then you will most likely relate to this book and it will make it all the more enjoyable. I strongly recommend to any of those people, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B002ZG999U|4.0|If you're looking for some award winning masterpiece then keep on looking, but if you in your face action and nothing else this is the movie for you. It's like the title says this is a typical 80's action flick 30 years later. Don't expect great character development or some huge plot, but do expect one liners and lots of fighting and explosions. If that is what you are looking for then this is the film for you
0553386794|5.0|Outstanding character development! Few of the characters are what we assume, one minute you loath them and the next you wish to champion their cause. The only other author that does this successfully is Tolkien. A truly epic fantasy! Expect the unexpected! You don't need to read far into the book before you realize that you can't anticipate the story, you must read on and let Martin tell his tale. A Game of Thrones is an outstanding book! After finishing the book I only hope that Martin continues to write, and fast!
B000006RHL|5.0|I've been a fan of Iron Maiden for as long as I can remmeber. I've heard almost all of thier studio releases, the live releases, and seen the perform live. still even after all the years and tours and live albums that follow Live After Death it still holds it's place as one of, if not the absolute best live Maiden performance.
1401323820|3.0|I only recently got into watching Castle and completely love the show, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that ABC had extended the idea so far as to publish Richard Castle's \\"Nikki Heat\\" novels.  Naturally, I simply had to have the books.  As a Castle fan, I'm thrilled. As an avid and discerning mystery-novel reader? Not so much.      Heat Wave is the first book in Richard Castle's new series, which he has based on his shadowing of NYPD detective Katherine Beckett, his new muse.  The books follow the adventures of an NYPD detective - Nikki Heat.  She's being shadowed by Pulitzer Prize-winning magazine journalist Jameson Rook who is doing an article based on her squad.  The previous three sentences are a lot less confusing if you watch the show!      This first book begins with the premise that Heat and Rook already know each other, so we don't get to see the true first meeting of the principal characters.  From there, the story moves to the case, and the other main characters begin to make their appearance.  As fascinated as I was with the very concept of the book, I in fact began to have minor issues with it from the very first page.    By about twenty pages in, we've met all the main characters; Nikki Heat, Jameson Rook, medical examiner Lauren Parry, and Heat's team of supporting detectives, Raley and Ochoa - together affectionately termed `Roach'.  However, I cannot \\"see\\" any of these characters in my mind at all.  There are no real descriptions of them - nothing for me to form a mental picture of the people I'm reading about. I'm therefore left to conclude that I'm meant to see the actual characters from the show in their thinly veiled counterparts on paper.    I do understand that Heat Wave was written to take advantage of the show's popularity and as an obvious tie-in as well.  Granted, that's clearly what the book truly is, but the potential was there to make it something much more amazing.  The entire premise could have been better treated. It could have been something fantastic on its own and still achieved the result of an exciting tie-in to Castle.    Richard Castle is supposed to be a best-selling author with a string of extremely successful books under his belt already.  Heat Wave should reflect that.  Unfortunately, it comes off in some parts as though it might be his first book - great premise, interesting story, but somehow lacking in some parts and needing some polish.  I can't help thinking that Rick Castle, who is good friends with the likes of such mystery greats as Cannell, Patterson and Connelly, wouldn't consider this a book worthy of that caliber.  Additionally, I can't suspend belief enough to accept that Rick Castle would lay bare his `real' life on the page, especially after he maintains to Beckett that Nikki Heat is merely based on her.    I may have bought the book because of Castle (and because Nathan Fillion is on the back cover!) but that does not preclude me wanting a well-written, captivating story - the same as I would require from any book I choose to buy.      What's even worse, as far as I'm concerned, is that Heat Wave absolutely had the potential to become that amazing book.  I kept catching glimpses of what it might have been.  It essentially made the reading of it more frustrating, because it would have been easier to dismiss the book out of hand as a simple marketing ploy, if there was no merit to it at all.  Instead, there was so much untapped possibility that I was doubly disappointed when none of it manifested.    While all of the above may seem to indicate that I did not enjoy the book, it truly isn't the case at all.  There was definitely much to love about Heat Wave.  There is a solid mystery, with interesting suspects and a believable plot.  The victims and suspects were better drawn than the main characters and comfortably stereotypical instead of mind-numbingly so.  Also, although I figured out \\"whodunit\\" before the end of the book, there were sufficient red herrings asto not make it too simplistic.    Naturally, the best parts of the book are the references to Castle, inclusive of actual lines from the show and the engaging banter between Heat and Rook.  Additionally, the sexual tension between Heat and Rook was also well handled, despite feeling a little rushed, and it gave another view of the matching tension between Beckett and Castle on the show.  I particularly loved Rick Castle's author's note at the end, which carried through the entire concept of the book having truly been written by the fictional character.  The blurbs on the cover from James Patterson and Stephen J. Cannell were also a wonderful touch.    Heat Wave is a wonderful concept that might have been better executed.  I'll continue to buy the other books in the series, because on one level - that of the clever tie-in to a show I love - it works incredibly well.  At the same time, I'm also looking forward to some improvement in the overall writing style and general caliber of the story.
B000002KEV|5.0|For the longest time I've heard many of my metal gods from Priest to Maiden to Helloween to Dio and countless others list Deep Purple as a major influence on thier musical style. So I decided to check them out and it is pretty obviuos why so many greats list this band as an influence. No words can truly describe just how good this live performance is but it is one of the best I have ever heard. I will definetly be checking out more of Deep Purple
B004G600A4|3.0|I got Tangled from the library, which I like to do (if possible) before purchasing a movie or book.  I ended up having to watch it twice, once by myself and once with my daughter.  It's a cute movie for kids, and yes, it's entertaining, but it's not what I've come to expect from Disney.  I was mostly disappointed in the Songs, Disney always has put these theater worthy, \\"go directly to classic\\" songs in their film, and none of the song in Tangled qualified in my opinion.  It's not on my list of favorite movies, and not something I'm going to rush out and buy.  All in all, it's worth a watch especially for kids, but not worth buying, Disney fell short.
0553386794|5.0|Read this series awhile ago.... and have been, unsuccessfully, seeking a comparable series by another author ever since. I've tried Erikson, Jordan, Gavriel Kay, Mieville, and other great authors, but alas... none seem to be in the same league as Martin...any suggestions? Martin spoils his readers. I now can't help longing for the same richness and intricacy in other authors' novels. This series is a true beauty; so much so, that if you hope to continue to enjoy the fantasy genre, you may actually want to stay away so as to be able to continue to enjoy other writers' works. Perhaps with the added publicity the series is getting from HBO, another generation of fantasy writers will deliver comparably sophisticated fare, but until then...
B0034G4ORM|4.0|You already know the basic storyline, this is an Independence Day-ish movie staged in Los Angeles.  I thought the movie did a great job developing characters throughout. Sgt. Nantz (Eckhart) not only had to battle the Aliens, he also had to fight thought his own inner demons stemmed from his previous military engagement in Middle East.  Lt. Martinez was green on the job fresh out of officer school and in charge of a platoon of Marines tasked with an important assignment behind enemy lines.  However, when the movie nears its end, it almost felt like everyone was in a hurry trying to get somewhere and it was over and credits rolling in a blink of an eye.  No hero meets beauty, no congratulatory hugs, no inspirational presidential speeches.  It just felt empty.  Then again, maybe I have seen too many cliche disaster movies.    Great special effects, good storyline and not entirely predictable.  Recommended.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I purchase this album with the DVD video.  I was skeptical at first.  I didn't know what to expect.  However, the music is great I enjoy the album and listen to it almost daily.  The music flows very well from track to track and of it has something unique to hear.  I think this could be one of Moby's better albums.  The DVD was actually fun to watch and gave me a chance to see Moby in action, if for just a bit.  Honestly, I expected booze bottles and cursing on the DVD, but it is none of that at all.  It is very nice and is appropriate for all ages and contains mostly of music videos from the album tracks.  Moby acts in the DVD and does a great job of acting and compiling the DVD.  Listen to some sample tracks.. see what you think, but I recommend Moby's albums.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I loved the original Angry Birds and also the \\"seasons\\" edition, but this one is the best I think. Better graphics and a cool storyline. If you're an Angry Birds fan and looking for more of what you love, this is well worth the price.    Can't wait to see what the Angry Birds team does next!!
B003INBOEM|4.0|This is one of Donnie Yen's best films to date.  The only other improvement would be Jet Lee in there too.  Together they are phenominal.  I first saw IP Man on DVD and very much enjoyed it.  Donnie Yen does a superb job with the coreography and is very convincing.  Also, I believe IP man was a very dedicated and humble man which I got from Donnies character.  I purchased the Blue Ray version for nothing more than the HD.  The picture in HD is great and clean with no hiccups like the DVD version- unless you upscaled it, otherwise horizontal bars and jaggys would appear.  The picture is much more 3 dimensional than the DVD version as should be.  However, I probably wouldn't expect it to start up without hitch unless you have a new blue ray player.  My laptop blue ray player required an update before the movie would play.  Having done that, I would recommend this title, especially if a fan of Donnie Yen.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|love me some uncle stevie.  little confused why he included a lengthy section about his accident here. i know this tragedy affected the writing of this book but he didnt really address how the incident impacted his craft and that is the topic of the book.  also he mentioned how he dislikes flashbacks and i just read colorado kid and 90 percent of that tale is flashback. really like both books though.
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|There's almost no correlation between my finger movements and the paddle, and i know this because if there were then my finger would cover the paddle and i'd never see it. As it is, i see the paddle because it's everywhere except where i point it.<br /><br />Literally. It's pretty, and it's useless.
1439102724|4.0|I absolutely love Jodi Picoult. I have loved almost every single book she has written so it was a given that I read this. The first thing that intrigued me was that it was about a music therapist. I work in a hospital where I sometimes work with a music therapist.   This novel made me laugh and cry. I felt as though I was on the journey with the characters. Some parts were emotionally difficult to read, but it was definitely worth it
B004SBX112|2.0|I love the Angry Birds games but dang, i'm starting to feel as if Rovio is deliberately making the updates as frustrating as possible. Bad enough i get a Rio update with the next two episodes \\"Coming Soon\\" but now this, i mean seriously , two levels and then wait? I got three stars both levels, now i get to wait for a seemingly gratuitous six hours. Frustrating, angering, NOT fun.<br /><br />AND it demands i have my wifi on, which i bought the paid version to avoid.
0307477479|1.0|I stopped reading it about 20 pages from the end because I cared so little about the unlikeable and uninteresting characters. The book seemed to be all over the place timeline wise. There was no focus, or coherent story line. Maybe I am not understanding something but I found I didn't care and for me, that is all that counts.
B001DZDTX6|5.0|This is the newest edition of Rush's \\"Moving Pictures\\" on CD. It is in an ecofriendly cardboard case and it does not have a booklet, surprisingly. However, the case design is very Prog-style so, that's cool. If you are not already aware, this CD features Rush's most famous song \\"Tom Sawyer\\". If that is not incentive enough to buy this, then let me tell you from personal experience, every song here is a classic. I listened to a lot of 80's flashback radio and these were the only Rush songs they played, and I mean EVER! If you are a Prog Rock fan and you don't own this CD, stop reading this review, and go pick it up. You won't regret it, not at all! Also, I can say I get the title joke, ha ha ha, good idea.
0736083863|5.0|As a Pilates instructor, I am always on the lookout for anatomy books with good pictures to help my students visualize what they are working on and trying to accomplish.  While many books have aided me in this, none has done it so well as this book.  When I show a student who is struggling with a certain exercis the appropriate picture, the immediate response is  \\"Now I understand!\\"  and improvement follows.  I would recommend this as a must have for all Pilates instructors and students.
1439102813|5.0|The story of Alice Howland, as written by Lisa Genova in Still Alice, has been explained by other reviewers so I'll keep my synopsis short.  The novel is about an eminent psychology professor at Harvard who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  She struggles through the minor forgetfulness and disorientation of the early stages, gets diagnosed, and experiences worsening symptoms as her life disintegrates by degree.  Her husband, also a PhD professor and researcher at Harvard, finds it difficult to cope with her disease while still maintaining his stature and work ethic.  Her adult children, while supportive, have their own self-absorbed lives to live.  And the administrators at Harvard, rightfully so, cannot allow her to continue in her current job when it becomes apparent that her teaching skills have declined. Her once brilliant worldwide lectures have become less than expert and not representative of Harvard standards.  And she is deemed incapable of continuing her research programs.<br /><br />We experience all this deterioration from Alice's viewpoint, instead of as an outside observer, as most stories are told.  And we suffer along with her.<br /><br />The destruction of brain process is visible from the outside but Genova takes us to the internal devastation where portions of the brain responsible for cognition and awareness are no longer accessible.  People in advanced stages of dementia cannot understand or verbalize such decimation so the author presents Alice's view by using early-onset as a tracking vehicle to gain the point of view while cognitive recognition is still available in her.<br /><br />I felt uncomfortable with the suddenness of the Alzheimer's diagnosis on Alice, thinking it normally took more time for the disease to be uncovered.  The author, in an interview at book's end, apparently reading my mind, stated she gave Alice a rapid path to diagnosis to get the book moving and to keep it to a reasonable length.  She also mentioned the need to include suicidal thoughts occurring in Alice that, although somewhat controversial in public mindset, has occurred in virtually every person with early-onset under the age of sixty five that the author knows.<br /><br />I found it interesting that symptoms in an early-onset victim's life that get assimilated and adjusted to, seem to always change at a later time creating more problems to be dealt with.  An insufferable life just starts to be tolerable when new obstacles appear, creating a sense of hopelessness.  To me, this gradual descent into despair is a very frightening aspect of Alzheimer's<br /><br />This book is brilliant.  It is written by an academic about events in the lives of academics so, as expected, there is abundant use of scientific and medical jargon.  However, Dr. Genova is careful to use professional language where appropriate and to write for the rest of us in the overall context of her story.  I actually found it enjoyable to delve into some of the terms and studies she included to find out more about them.<br /><br />Dr. Lisa Genova holds a Ph.D. from Harvard in neuroscience.  She is a columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association and a recognized neurology expert who is also a public speaker on Alzheimer's issues.  She seems to focus on fictional stories that deal with brain disorders.  Here we have early-onset Alzheimer's.  Her new book, Left Neglected, is about a fast-living professional woman who suffers a life-altering brain injury in an automobile accident.  And still to come is a book about childhood autism.<br /><br />Genova makes abundant use of experts in formulating her story line.  Her education and academic standing gives her uncommon access to other brilliant minds.  She has the ability and credentials to ask the right questions in the right professional language and to understand the clinically formed answers.  She is then able to apply the knowledge she gains to form the thought processes and actions of thosesuffering from the disabling disorder into clear layman prose.<br /><br />She also states in her interview that she wanted to create a story that was \\"a truthful and respectful depiction of life with Alzheimer's,\\" and she wanted the story to be from the point of view of the victim rather than the caregiver.  Dr. Genova, you have done so magnificently.yman prose.      She also states in her interview that she wanted to create a story that was \\"a truthful and respectful depiction of life with Alzheimer's,\\" and she wanted the story to be from the point of view of the victim rather than the caregiver.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|I'm becoming more convinced that Justin Vernon can't write music that isn't beautiful.  This album is much less acoustic then their last, and while the music isn't as catchy it has more depth and flow.  My first listen to this album was as I was driving trail ridge road in Colorado and I guess the best thing I can say is it was a perfect soundtrack for that stunning drive.  The songs have layers that are put together flawlessly.  BUY IT NOW!
0143038583|5.0|I heard  a lot about this book but had blown it off thinking I knew \\"all about this stuff\\". Pollan is a great writer, delivering solid information and facts that will change your life and relationship to food and the food industry. I highly recommend this book. It should be required high school reading.
0385341008|5.0|I got lost in the world of post-WWII London and on the island of Guernsey.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the audio book.  How wonderful to have a different person read for each character.  It brought everyone to life!  It was like radio theater - what a delight!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|Taking on the persona of a redneck and blowing up innocent aquatic creatures isn't something I'd normally put on my list of hobbies or gaming interests, but like the title says, this game was surprisingly very fun.<br /><br />I found myself going back and playing it almost daily until I &quot;beat&quot; it by getting all the things for the blonde and buying the most awesome seafaring vessel imaginable.<br /><br />Overall, it is a pretty great game and rarely crashes on me. Just wish the dev would update the place that says 'coming soon' already.<br /><br />Phone: myTouch slide 3G
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|I liked this movie. No, it's not `Taken 2', but I didn't feel like that was the expectation created by the previews. While the plot seemed obvious to others, I don't watch enough espionage films for that to be true for me, and I was as caught up in the mystery as the protagonist was for the first half of the film.     Liam Neeson's character is believable as a man who finds himself without his memory and in a world where his wife will not acknowledge him and another man seems to have taken over his life. Diane Kruger is excellent, but where is she supposed to be from? Ukraine? Maybe? This is a minor detail, but I guess because Kruger is German and the movie takes place in Germany, I was expecting her character to be, well, German.     Frank Langella is his usual amazing self. He looks like a teddy bear, but plays evil characters. Therefore, I love him. And Aidan Quinn gives a perfectly understated performance that adds to the credibility of the film.     Although January Jones does well in her scenes without Neeson, the two of them have zero chemistry. With him, she's very stiff, so it seems like a creepy older guy/too young woman situation there. To me, that was the only drawback in the film (although a pretty major one considering that the two of them are supposedly lovers).     Overall, I think this film won't appeal to those looking for the intensity of `Taken' or who are very familiar with the genre. However, for the rest of us, this film gets three and a half stars. Because of the performances of Langella, Quinn, and Kruger, I'm tipping it over to four.
B00005JM02|5.0|Wonderful plot and even better effects on high-def disc! Would recommend this movie to anyone from the ages 0-99! It's a PIXAR production and they are the best in the business when it comes to animation, that's why Disney decided to hook up with them recently. AAA+
B004WPYNY8|5.0|How anyone can give this album anything less than a 5 star review is beyond me. Not only is this album Symphony X at the very top of their game but this album is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, one of the very best metal records I've had the privilege of listening to in nearly 25 years. Everything from the impeccable production to the top notch song writing is incredible. It's been a very long time since I've immediately loved every single song of an album after the very first listen. \\"V\\" was a fantastic record and \\"Paradise Lost\\" was an incredible experience but I strongly believe Symphony X have stepped up their game big time with this one. This album is a true testament to metal. Each song is beautifuly crafted and blends the perfect mix of melody and aggression. It's heavy, epic and absolutely addictive. This is the work of passionate musicians. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up now.    I'm giving this one a 5 star review, but only because it doesn't go up to 100.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome!  I read it in half a day, I just couldn't put it down!  I am almost done the second book which is just as good, & can't wait to start the last book in the series!  This is a must read!!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I have to say, I was put off by the cover of this book - seriously, this guy looks sinister and a little cranky. But I downloaded to my Kindle anyway, knowing I wouldn't have to look at the cover any time I might choose to read it. Well, I read it over the space of 2 days (it isn't overly long) and it was a good read.    I have only read 2 really good books on writing before this one (Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" and the Strunk and White book), so I didn't know what to expect as I have been sorely disappointed by the lack of inspiration given by most of the other books I have tried.    This book is different. It's like Stephen King's book, in that it inspires you to try new things and new ways of doing things than what you may previously have read. It also tells you step by step how John Locke achieved his sales.    Now, I am not saying we can all achieve that, but his marketing strategy, whilst used for things like cars, movies, insurance etc, is a new concept for e-publishing.    How many people out there have published their own books only to find they didn't sell enough to even make back their outlay TO get the book in print or on the Kindle etc? I can tell you how many, TOO many! No one wants to tell you how to do this as a self published author because the publishing companies do not want you to be able to succeed on your own because that sounds the death knell to their business, much the way the Internet has seen the decline of print newspapers.    There are roughly 10% bad reviews for this book and 90% positive, that should tell you something about how it is being received by writers.    The 10% bad reviews seem to be from people who knew all the stuff in the book already, which begs the question, why did you buy it then? Personally, most of the writers I know are creative people, WE don't like sales and marketing very much, WE like writing and WE would much rather leave the marketing and sales and all the mundane non-creative stuff to other people. But, weknow that if we e-publish anything we are going to have to do this work ourselves or pay someone else to do it - personally, I'd rather give John Locke's ideas a try before paying someone else who will care about MY book only as long as I pay them to care.    I care about my book as if it's one of my kids because it is one of my creative babies - I want to succeed and I liked what was put across in this book because I don't have a Twitter account, I have no idea how Twitter works really, but based on this book I will give it a try. I have a blog but had never thought to use it to target my target audience. I have just recently set up a website of my own and I will follow John's advice to drive people from blog and Twitter to there. I may even set up a Facebook page too.    I think this book is great for anyone just about to jump into self-publishing, or seriously considering it in the near future, and don't just look at John Locke's success in epublishing either - I know of at least one other author having great success who writes in a totally different genre: Amanda Hocking \\"Switched\\" - Trylle trilogy. Her books are fun to read too, she starts the first book in a trilogy at 99 cents and the next ones are $2.99 - you're going to want to read all 3 so she makes a smart move of increasing the price for the remainder of the books. These are Kindle best sellers too!    I don't know John Locke or Amanda Hocking, but I hope using John's method to be successful in my own epublishing venture too, I don't even care if I'm not as successful as John, I just want to be in charge of my own fate as a writer and in charge of my own voice, without having some pencil pusher without a creative bone in his/her body telling me, no, this just isn't right for the market right now. Tell John Locke that - he actually sells Westerns (OMG, that IS bizarre).
0465022227|5.0|Dr. Feibelman's \\"A PhD is Not Enough!\\" is a candid, yet authoritative, excursion into the inner workings of your scientific career.  As a first year graduate student, I found his advice timely and his writing engaging.  Despite the fact that many of the discussed topics are still years ahead (post-docs, faculty job interviews, grant writing), there is no harm in peeking forward to the approaching journey. I feel that jaded graduate students will find the author's logic lucid and timely as they pursue their careers out of the \\"womb\\" of grad school. While the perspectives of the author are deeply seated in the sciences, students from other backgrounds will definitely benefit from this book as well.  Highly recommended! A valuable, insightful read.

B0006J28L4|5.0|Excellent film! Malcom lived a very interesting life filled with many transformations.  This movie touches on the civil rights movement and life for African Americans at the time, and also has a spiritual aspect regarding the muslim faith.  The special features were also excellent. This is Spike Lee's best film ever!
014241543X|3.0|Okay, so this book is about 196 pages. The accident occurs on page 13. Now there's 183 pages of...nothing. All that really happens is she goes to the hospital. And stays there. And waits. And has flashbacks about nothing of importance. For 183 pages. It was really frustrating!<br /><br />What gets me is Gayle Forman is a good author. When I was reading the flashbacks, I was really into it. She is really able to catch your interest and keep it. The problem is, there was no plot. Mia didn't even know how to get back into her body or move on. She never found answers. She didn't overcome any problems. She didn't change, or have any life-altering lessons or epiphanies. Frankly, it bored me.<br /><br />When Kim tells Mia that if Mia becomes one of those girls who are obsessed with their boyfriend, she will shoot her. Mia agrees vehemently. But at the end of the book, Mia makes her decision because of Adam. Before he came, she was ready to leave her in-between world to (possibly) join her parents and brother. But as soon as she saw him, her decision flew out the window, and she went back into her own body. I'm not encouraging Mia to choose death over life, but I thought it was so important for her to make her own decision, based on her own feelings. She was okay with leaving Kim, even though Kim begged her to stay, but she couldn't let Adam lose her, even though it's not what she really wanted? That was disappointing. In the end, she became one of those girls.<br /><br />3 stars. I wasn't really thrilled with it, but it was okay. I'm interested to see what Forman has in store in Where She Went.
B004P6EQE6|5.0|Arguably The Byrds' best album, this just punches out of your speakers !  I've just bought the Bad Company gold re-master \\"Straight Shooter\\" purely on the strength of the job they have done on this Byrds album this and will consider \\"A Space in Time\\" by Ten Years After too.
1416972250|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm one of those people that can completely without a doubt love a book, and still have several things to criticize. This one is no exception. City of Glass is my favorite so far of the Mortal Instruments series. It was consistently thrilling, and I loved \\"experiencing\\" the new country Idris.<br /><br />I'd like to say first: FINALLY. I had a strong suspicion since it was mentioned that Jace and Clary were not siblings, and it took until Jocelyn woke up to declare that they were NOT related. Gah. And after all of that, Clary still made out with her real brother. Figures.<br /><br />I found this story thrilling, yet very calm and romantic, in a way. Clary seems to have a very one-track mind: Save her mother, at all costs. It's this that propels her to make the choices she does, against everyone's - even Jace's - wishes.<br /><br />I noticed that there was even less humor and sarcasm in this book than there was in the previous two. To me, if a book has humor in it, it's just so much more entertaining to read. Witty and smart-assed Jace seemed to be replaced by an unsure and hardened version of himself. This saddened me some, but surprisingly the story itself kept me busy enough that it didn't detract from the book.<br /><br />One thing that was inconsistent was Cassandra Clare's descriptions of characters and surroundings. Sometimes when reading about a setting or character, I'll be bored to death reading about it constantly. I mean, how many times have we read about Jace being tall and blond and perfect, and Clary being a red-head? Yet, I can never get Luke's appearance in my head. I didn't actually realize that Magnus looked like a young-adult. I always imagined Magnus as a middle-aged man with eccentric fashion sense. Sometimes a scene is perfectly described, such as Amatis' house. Other times I can't picture a scene for the life of me, like Idris. Were the buildings skyscrapers? Wide buildings? Skinny? Lots of small houses? Shops? There just wasn't enough description for Idris, and I feel that for all the times we heard Shadowhunters discuss it like Idris was the most beautiful country in the world, Clare didn't do it justice.<br /><br />In conclusion, excellent book. 5 stars for fantastic plot, characters and smooth writing (minus some descriptions). There were some open ends, like how Valentine could kill through a projection, but I'm hoping those will be answered in future books. I've already pre-ordered City of Fallen Angels!iption for Idris, and I feel that for all the times we heard Shadowhunters discuss it like Idris was the most beautiful country in the world, Clare didn't do it justice.     In conclusion, excellent book. 5 stars for fantastic plot, characters and smooth writing (minus some descriptions). There were some open ends, like how Valentine could kill through a projection, but I'm hoping those will be answered in future books. I've already pre-ordered City of Fallen Angels!
B0007GBBVO|1.0|I purchased the movie because of the 3D. Big mistake the 3D is so bad it is unwatchable because of multiple shadows this is the worst 3D technology I have ever seen. Before writing this I waited for my order of the good red and blue anaglyph glasses  to come in thinking the paper glasses were the problem. They made no difference. The acting is poor, though I thought the theme was kinda cute, and that is the only reason I gave it one star. don't waste your money.
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones is an extraordinary book. It's one of those books that had the perfect amount of humor and sarcasm, yet it was also very serious, and made me reflect on myself. It was fast-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I only had 2 problems with this book. First, the outcomes were painfully predictable. As soon as it was mentioned that Jocelyn was Valentine's wife, I was waiting for Clary to realize the possibility of Valentine also being her father. It didn't seem so far-fetched, because Clary was realizing that her mother had basically made her whole life a lie, so why couldn't her father be one, too?<br /><br />The second problem I had with City of Bones was the lies that Valentine spun around the truth in the end. When I reached the last page of the book I was angry, because it left me in a complete state of confusion. Is Jace actually Clary's brother, or did Valentine just say that? (Ew, by the way.) What actually happened in the last few chapters of that book that gave a sense of closure to the first part of the saga? As funny and interesting as the book is, it left me frustrated that I couldn't wrap my mind around Valentine's lies/truths. For this, I gave the book four stars, because as frustrating as it is, it makes me want to just read it over and over again to figure it out.<br /><br />I also couldn't help but notice it's glaring similarities to the Harry Potter novels, especially with Valentine's (Voldemort, much?) obsession with \\"blood purity.\\" Mundanes were like Muggles, and also seen as ignorant and childish. Places of their world were concealed with powerful charms, like how Idris is an invisible location in Europe that Mundanes just walk right past. The glamour also reminded me of the Muggles' inability to see magic right in front of them. With all of that said, the City of Bones is still highly original and it's little similarities does not distract me from the rest of the book.<br /><br />I fell in love with Jace about 5 minutes after I started reading his wry sense of humor. He's very conceited, which usually is a very strong drawback, but with him it just enhances his desirability. I love everything about Jace. It also seems as if there's going to be a sort of love triangle in the future books, between Jace, Simon, and Clary. Unless Jace & Clary really are siblings, which I'm still not convinced of. I really hope not, but if there is, Jace betters Simon in most (if not all) ways.<br /><br />All in all, 4 stars for an excellent mix of humor, sincerity, and somewhat originality of plot. I can't wait to read City of Ashes!ry sense of humor. He's very conceited, which usually is a very strong drawback, but with him it just enhances his desirability. I love everything about Jace.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Dexter is about a serial killer who hunts other serial killers. The show is somewhere between Psych and Criminal Minds in relation to seriousness. In Psych, while the characters are well drawn, their interactions with each other are often charmingly cartoony, and the plotlines are often similar. We come in with a different set of expectations than we would have watching Criminal Minds, which may ask us to suspend disbelief in relation to the reliability of profiling, but is overall very realistic and on point.   Dexter doesn't entirely fit the profile of a sociopath (he genuinely loves his sister for instance) but that makes his character accessible. In Criminal Minds the main characters balance out the bloodshed and Dexter's ability to empathize with a few select people make make him somewhat relatable. The show also contains an element of comic relief. Dexter often muses about his inability to understand other people, the necessity of blending in, and his desire to kill. These thoughts are narrated with such earnestness that they almost seem endearing. Much like Emily Deschanel's character in Bones, the viewer understands what the protagonist does not, and Dexter means well in most circumstances.   Just not when another killer enters the picture. That would be the exception.
0545123291|4.0|I loved Linger better than Shiver. It had none of the hesitancy that Shiver contained, but rather constant decisions and action.<br /><br />When Cole was introduced, I was completely and totally against him. I hated him because he constantly wrote about needing drugs, alcohol, and/or women. I loathed when the book changed into his perspective, but by the end of Linger, I was completely changed. Even though I'm still not really fond of Cole, I decided that I liked getting into his head when he started to change for the better. He discovered that maybe losing yourself to the wolves wasn't the right thing to do. I hope he's in Forever, because I'd love to know how his story ends.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about the constant perspective changes. I like them because I get to see into other character's heads, but they were confusing. They would change so suddenly that I would have to double-check to see which character I was reading. While I would definitely not like to read just Grace's perspective, I would have liked slightly easier transitions into each character.<br /><br />I have to admire the author's ability to not make Sam into the typical romance boyfriend. Sam is delicate and scarred and afraid of things. Most of the main males in YA books (Edward Cullen much?) have to be tough and fearless and perfect. I like that Sam is not like that. He needs Grace just as much as she needs him, if not more.<br /><br />I had no idea where Stiefvater was going to go with this book, but I didn't think that she was going to make Grace a werewolf. To me, Grace was always the odd one out on purpose. Able to see the wolf-images in her head, but never actually be a wolf. It's part of what made her who she is. Now that barrier has been broken, but what is she possibly going to do? She has too many ties to her humanity: her parents, school, friends, etc. I'm really curious to see how it's going to work out - or if it will work out.<br /><br />I'm also very shocked that Sam chose to be human rather than turn into a wolf to stay with Grace. He struck me as the type of guy that would give up anything for her, but I see now that he values his humanity over being with Grace. Interesting.<br /><br />4 stars total, because of its great story, consistent characters (though a lot of rough perspective changes), and really nice poetry/lyrics.o a wolf to stay with Grace.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I rented this movie based on the strong reviews. (At the time I had not heard of Donnie Yen). I was blown away! Two of my favorite martial arts movies are Bruce Lee's \\"Return of the Dragon\\" (a real classic!) and Jet Li's \\"Fist of Legend.\\" I didn't think I would see anything that could live stand up in overall quality and appeal of those two movies; this one does. I even showed it to my wife (who is not crazy about these types of movies) and she liked it very much. That says a lot.     So I highly recommend you see this. If you like the overall feel, mood and quality of Jet Li's best, along with the skill and effect of Bruce Lee, you will definitely like this.    Also, the sequel (IP Man 2) is just about as good and the prequel (although not with Donnie Yen) is also very good and gives context to the characters before IP Man 1. The actor who plays a young IP Man in the prequel does an excellent job and looks enough like Donnie Yen that it is believable.
159514188X|2.0|I did not like this book at all. Her reasons for killing herself were hardly justifiable. It is never EVER acceptable to commit suicide. There are no reasons good enough to end your life. Period. Making tapes to blame others for your destructive actions is not okay.<br /><br />Hannah's first tape explained that the first person she'd ever kissed had then bragged to everyone about doing more with her. That's reason one? Really?! That's just real life. It happens to so many people, it's hardly worth dwelling on.<br /><br />Another reason was that someone made a list saying that she had the best ass in freshman year, and from then on people thought it was okay to touch her and comment on it. Again, that is just petty high school drama. If someone touches you without your consent, you should report sexual harassment, not keep it a secret and then take your own life.<br /><br />And then the worst part. Hannah thought she had it bad. But she just sat hidden away in a closet witnessing a girl getting raped. She didn't call the police, or make any action to help her. She just...let it happen. But Hannah thinks her life is twisted? I'd feel horrible for the girl that just got raped when two people knew what was going on at the time. That whole situation makes me sick to my stomach.<br /><br />I also wasn't really fond of Asher's writing style, either. While I liked Clay's commentary on various parts of the tapes, it was irritating to go from Hannah's tale to Clay's every couple of lines. I found myself having to re-read sections of it so I could follow both tales.<br /><br />I feel generous giving this book 2 stars, if only because I felt compelled to figure out what all of her reasons were. But sadly, I was extremely disappointed in this book.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|I expect so much more from Clint Eastwood. As another reviewer accurately pointed out, the opening sequence is amazing and draws you in, making you believe that this is going to be one amazing movie. But it rapidly goes downhill from there. Slow moving scenes with mumbling, boring dialogue that never really reaches a valid point. Short scenes where Matt Damon's character is whining because he doesn't want to be a psychic anymore. And perhaps one of the most disappointing scenes is where for nearly 20 minutes there is nothing but French dialogue between two principle players in the movie and NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I was like, what the heck?? Really? The movie ran snail slow and never reached the level of excitement that the opening sequence does. I wanted to love this movie. I love Clint Eastwood as a director but this piece of cinematic fluff just didn't do it for me. What an atmospheric mess. I want my two hours back. Sorry.

0399230033|5.0|I think she likes the speed of turning the pages.  There is not a lot of wording on each page and some pages don't have any words (so you can either make them up or move along).  She likes the page where it's all black and the ladies eyes are open wide.  It will be fun to see how she likes this book as she gets older.  I know some people don't like this book because they think it's boring or sneaky, but I think it's cute and a quick read for bedtime.  I really like the pictures also.

B004SBQAN8|5.0|I Am Number Four is an inspiring action movie. The story is packed with a fascinating story as well as hints of true life in a science fiction setting. In I Am Number Four, the main character is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by invading aliens called Mogadorians. He is Number Four and the Mogadorians are hunting down each and every one of the nine who escaped Lorien. These nine have the power, when put together, to eliminate the force of the Mogadorians.  John Smith, number four, has been moving around all his life on Earth since he got here. He was forced to change identity multiple of times by the fact that the Mogadorians were hunting him down. His guardian, Henri, tried to protect John with keeping his profile low and deleting things that got on internet about John. The Mogadorians quickly find Number Four's scent and trace him to Paradise, Ohio.  Meanwhile, John goes to a new school and makes friends and enemies already. Sarah Hart is the first girl John sees and immediately was attracted to her. Another kid named Sam is also in the alien picture without actually being an alien. His father had predicted that true aliens would land on Earth and was taken by the Mogadorians for his knowledge. Sam and John bond together and try to find his father.   Spending more time with Sarah, John realizes he is falling for her. Back on Lorien, love was eternal but that wasn't the case on Earth. However, when Henri forces John to leave Paradise, John knows he must leave but still refuses. The next day he wakes up to find Henri missing. He receives a call to meet up at a predetermined place. He goes there with Sam and finds Henri who informs him that it was actually a trap. They escape but barely and it cost Henri's life. Going to say go bye to Sarah, they get caught by the Mogadorians and the police and flee to the school. They meet up with Number Six, another girl alien. They battle with the Mogadorians, causing destruction of practically the entire building and escape narrowly.  Number Four decides to continue on his already set journey of reuniting all of the escapees of Lorien. He decides to take Sam along and says he final goodbye to his loved Sarah.  I feel I Am Number Four is an inspiring action packed movie. It shows that friends are important throughout life. They help guide you through life and through moments unbearable. I would recommend this movie to anybody fascinated by action and motivation. I Am Number Four is a extremely brilliant film.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|American moviemakers don't have an especially impressive track record when it comes to adapting hit foreign films for stateside audiences (who generally avoid like the plague anything with subtitles).  But with \\"Let Me In,\\" a remake of the highly acclaimed Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In,\\" Hollywood finally gets one right.  This somber and chilling tale of a friendless, put-upon 12-year-old boy who becomes romantically (albeit platonically) involved with the vampire-girl next door emerges as a sort of antidote to the far more crowd-pleasing and commercially successful \\"Twilight\\" series, providing a more subdued and thoughtful variation on the same theme.<br /><br />Transferring its setting from Scandinavia to an equally frigid and snowbound Los Alamos, New Mexico, the remake remains true to the core elements that made the original such a quality film in the first place:  its artful tone, its unsensationalistic approach to its material, and its incisive look at what it means to be a misfit in a world in which conformity is prized above all else - and never more so than during adolescence.  For Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) are both outcasts from society, Abby quite literally since her condition makes it impossible for her to interact with others in any kind of meaningful way (except to devour their blood).  But Owen is no less of an outsider, since his diminutiveness, shyness and dreamy nature make him an easy and perpetual target for the town's bullies.  It's no surprise, then, that Owen and Abby eventually reach out to one another for love and acceptance, despite the seeming impossibility of their relationship.<br /><br />As a horror film, \\"Let Me In\\" doesn't hold back from showing us the requisite gore and grue that comes with the genre, but director Matt Reeve's script is far more concerned with the interaction among characters and the exploration of theme than it is with piling up easily achievable gross-out moments.  For instance, the gruesome task of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.<br /><br />Smit-McPhee and Moretz are both superb as the inter-species Romeo and Juliet, and there's a fine supporting cast to boot.<br /><br />In this case at least, \\"Let Me In\\" is a command well worth obeying.of securing victims that Abby and others close to her are forced to do to assure her continued survival helps to make this a profoundly sad and emotionally unsettling story.

0811866351|2.0|Books made for the purpose of exploring the art of creating an animated film are supposed to give the reader an overall sense of how the film was conceived, the choices made in bringing it to life and the changes made throughout the production. The Art of Princess and the Frog tells us none of these things. I love to hear in depth stories of what went on during production, why they chose this over that... where their heads were in creation. But while reading the Art of Princess and the Frog I felt growing frustration and annoyance. The writers have taken what could have been an excellent book and turned it into a brochure.<br /><br />For example, in a small opening foreward John Musker and Ron Clements tell us more than the rest of the book. Most importantly that, although Disney animators had tried for years to develop their own version of the Frog Princess,  the final film was originally a Pixar project that was brought over to Disney by John Lasseter after he took over as the head of Animation at Disney studios. Really? Fantastic! Lets see the Pixar variation before Disney animators took over... How about a chapter explaining why Pixar could never get the story going, or why John Lasseter wanted an african american princess movie? Or was it John Musker? Or Ron Clements? Whose idea was it to make Tianna the frog princess? None of these questions are even brought up, let alone examined by the writers.<br /><br />The book is written with little prose and many pictures. Beautiful pictures they may be but with little or no commentary about what stage of the process we're viewing we have little or no idea about how the animators came to the decisions that ultimately became the film seen on screen. By the way it is written you come to the conclusion  the writers really do not understand how these films are made.So instead of doing research and being informative they have inserted snippets of college student writing to replace actual, interesting information.<br /><br />This mundane drivel gives us precious little insight into how the characters were developed. For instance, on the chapter on Tiana's parents James and Eudora (no last name) begins with, \\" Tiana's parents are deftly drawn and important.\\"<br /><br />End of paragraph.<br /><br />What??! They are \\"deftly drawn\\"??? Aren't ALL the characters drawn in a \\"deft\\" manner??  And why are they important? Are they important simply because they're the heroines parents or because in creating them the animators learned something important? Why?<br /><br />The paragraph about the parents directly continues with a quote from animator Ruben Aquino, \\" They [Tiana's parents] don't have much screen time, but I think of characters like that as very important for the emotional storyline.\\" End quote.<br /><br />Alright, WHY do you think that? The time spent on the parents is the same spent on almost all the characters..... four small paragraphs. Mostly a quote from the film. Nothing about how the parents were created, who they used as inspiration and how difficult or easy it was.<br /><br />Deftly drawn, sheesh.<br /><br />It gets worse with the chapter describing the \\" Dark Side of New Orleans\\". This refers to the \\"bad guy's joint\\" area of the film, where the beautiful city of New Orleans gets dark and mean looking so that the villain of the story has a place to hang out. Not a problem, the film makers did a good job as we can see by the pictures of the place. However, instead of telling us how the visual designers came about drawing the backgrounds ( how they came up with their palette, how they changed the architecture to suit the mood without changing the look of the city, why they made the entire \\" Friends on the Other Side\\" song aglow like a frickin' Toon Town ride and brag about how cool that visual really was) the writers sum up the visuals with a punchy line like this; \\" In designing these more ominous settings of the city, the artists developed a visual vocabulary that would reinforce both the mood of the spaces and the characters that inhabit them.\\"<br /><br />Gah. Visual vocabulary? I guess we should be glad that THEY knew what they were talking about. Care to explain it a little more? Not much. Tall vertical spaces and disquieting candles my foot. Instead of being clever they've made it boring. Why not tell us some more interesting details?<br /><br />As far as moral ambiguity goes this sentence about Naveens voluntarily entering the \\"disquieting\\" area is written as so;<br /><br />\\"The balances of a life well lived are a part of the appeal of this city to Naveen, the idea that without indulgence once cannot truly enjoy morality.\\"<br /><br />Excuse me I guess I never understood that \\"morality\\" was some kind of experience to be \\"truly\\" enjoyed. But, as long as we're on Naveen how about a little insight into why he acts like a jerk? Can the writers give us some semblance of how Naveen was created and what drives his personality?<br /><br />\\" Disney has a long tradition of princes, but they all fall short of being characters in and of themselves.\\" Says Randy Haycock, the supervising animator of Naveen, \\" They're functional. They give the princesses somebody to fall in love with. But in terms of having a real personality, or a real attitude-or any kind of flaw, in fact? Never.\\"<br /><br />Wait a minute.... does he mean that Aladdin didn't have a personality? And wasn't the ENTIRE message of the film that Aladdin learns his lying is a bad thing? Isn't lying considered a kind of flaw? No wait, Aladdin doesn't count, right? That was a movie about a prince! Even less, a guy pretending to be a prince until he actually does become a prince! Not a princess... no long standing Disney Princess came out of Aladdin that would make the poor boy count as a character with a personality. Jasmine, anyone?<br /><br />Randy continues, \\"Prince Eric probably came the closest to having actual personality. But he was still flawless.\\"<br /><br />So Disney's way of promoting their newest characters is to completely trash their old ones. I get it.... but Eric wasn't flawless. He was so loyal to the idea of his first love he almost lost Ariel to the image of singing Ariel. I mean, come on! And if you agree that Eric and Aladdin were somehow both personality-less, no one can throw the Beast from Beauty and the Beast in that category. And no spoiled, egotistical brat like Naveen is going to put the Beast in that category. What are they thinking? Who gets away with such self serving arrogance? This animator must think he IS Naveen. Yeesh!! You should never cut down another character to promote your own... you should be positive about the character even WITH his flaws not BECAUSE of them!<br /><br />I think this attitude prevails throughout the Princess and the Frog film as well as the book. The film had flaws but they were mostly overlooked or ignored because of the sheer gratitude of a generation starving for 2D films again. I am one of the throng desirous of more films of this stature but I am not so grateful that I cannot see it for its flaws and its creators for theirs.<br /><br />There was a LOT to say about the making of this film. The problems they faced from a variety of sources and the creators ability to overcome and even succeed in the face of those who would find fault at anything because of the awesome idea of making the lead an African American Princess. As well as the conception of creating a princess inside of an American story!<br /><br />Unfortunately this book doesn't say anything about the films concept, its creation or design. Its a large, lovely picture book and nothing more. What a disappointment.Gah. Visual vocabulary? I guess we should be glad that THEY knew what they were talking about. Care to explain it a little more? Not much. Tall vertical spaces and disquieting candles my foot. Instead of being clever they've made it boring. Why not tell us some more interesting details?     As far as moral ambiguity goes this sentence about Naveens voluntarily entering the \\"disquieting\\" area is written as so;     \\"The balances of a life well lived are a part of the appeal of this city to Naveen, the idea that without indulgence once cannot truly enjoy morality.\\"    Excuse me I guess I never understood that \\"morality\\" was some kind of experience to be \\"truly\\" enjoyed. But, as long as we're on Naveen how about a little insight into why he acts like a jerk? Can the writers give us some semblance of how Naveen was created and what drives his personality?    \\" Disney has a long tradition of princes, but they all fall short of being characters in and of themselves.\\" Says Randy Haycock, the supervising animator of Naveen, \\" They're functional. They give the princesses somebody to fall in love with. But in terms of having a real personality, or a real attitude-or any kind of flaw, in fact? Never.\\"    Wait a minute.... does he mean that Aladdin didn't have a personality? And wasn't the ENTIRE message of the film that Aladdin learns his lying is a bad thing?

1416955070|5.0|I wanted to read this book the moment I saw the cover. Something about it spoke to me. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This may have been my first book with Nephilm and fallen angels. I may be wrong, I can't remember anymore. Anywho, it's my favorite in this genre- even if it was my first, it was not my last. I love the world Clare has created- lots of characters, lots of different elements, characters I want to be real in a world I kinda hope goes on and I just don't know it. I really like that although this series has characters that are werewolves or vampires they aren't Twilight characters. Even the \\"good guys\\" have a sense of danger. Clary- yes, I admit, she can be a little annoying at times- is believable and I can relate to her. I have never had a crush on a fictional like I do on Jace. He's in a different class than, say, Mr Darcy, but don't make me chose.<br /><br />If you're expecting literary greatness (or you're a book snob like my brother), get out of the YA section. I found this well written with a pace that flowed nicely. For fans of Paranormal Romance, don't skip this series.<br /><br />When I finished this book, I was so glad I didn't find this series until after the first three had been published. Love this series!

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I've been a fan of Les Miserables for many years and have seen it several times on B'way and London. This production encompasses  the best of all I have seen and heard.  Brilliantly produced.Deeply moving. The encore segment featuring past stars singing with the present cast was thrilling. POWERFUL!     PS. How refreshing to be able to understand each and every word sung. We Yanks could learn a lot!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down, it is well written with lots of adventure and  it has been a nice novelty to me since I do not read  fantasy but this I can recommend.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I was working my way up the Vince Flynn series of novels when I heard from Steve Gibson that Mark had written this book.    I took a chance on it. Out side of a minor ? in the last few pages the book held together really well and I'll forgive the ? for a first time author.  I can't go into it, it is fairly minor and to mention it would ruin it for others.    Mark is truly talented, I've heard rumors that there will be a second book.  I'll buy it when it comes out.    Btw, thanks for the great windows tools you gave away for free.  Your system internals tools bailed me out many times.    Buying your book as a way of saying thanks and getting a darn good read was win win for both of us.    Wes Szumera
