B008JFLWLE|1.0|Thankfully it was free.  It is difficult to manage.  I got it for my grandchildren.  They all declared it a 'dud'.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|This is one of those games that bugs you at every chance to spend real money to buy 'coins' that will run out very quickly. NO THANKS!!!<br /><br />Then there is the strange issue of the size of the game. On Amazon it was stated as just over 80 MB. Once the very long download was finished, my device reported a measely 1.45 MB. So what happened to the rest of it? The download lasted long enough to have been 80, but even after uninstalling the game, the device only gained the 1.45 MB or so.<br /><br />While playing, the two most irritating things were the constant suggestions to buy coins, and the long, long, long time it took to RECALIBRATE and RELOAD the game every single time you die.<br /><br />I'm going to take a guess here and say that the only reason this game has such a high rating is likely because most players are probably pre-teens who have access to their parent's credit cards. If you're an older person who values your money and time, pass on this one. Having sharks trying to get money out of me every few minutes just reminds me of Washington D.C., and we're all pretty sick of those idiots by now, aren't we!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|this is a fascinating movie.  I love the concept and the story lines. this story will be timeless. awesomeness. yeah.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the best since I c as my have my own horse I also love  how we can make aren
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I love this CD both sound and lyrics.  I like it as much as Back to Bedlum.  This one was love at first liston.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When the game updates there is new characters, like there is a paris girl for this update and you won't know what characters you will get next update only for a while so you better hurry and download this game.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I just loved this movie. I am waiting for a sequel. for once this is a movie where I couldn't predict the ending.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|Cecile McLorin Salvant is the type of singer that a variety of &#34;types&#34; would enjoy listening to. Her selection of songs makes it a disc that would be shareable with almost every music lover I know. Terrific!
B000301YY8|5.0|The lyrics really get to you and the sound is great.  Looking forward to more of his music in the future.
0061537969|5.0|Love this book. Very quick read. If you like/own dogs, this is an absolute must read. I started my dog book kick by reading &#34;A Dog's Journey,&#34; as well as it's follow-up, but this book was much more rich and deep. A very good read. I actually also bought the children's version because I wanted to share FUN literature with my English class to show them reading can be, and is fun!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Really fun game, works perfectly. STILL WAITING FOR CANDY CRUSH!! Why is that game on every other device than the kindle fire??? I get hooked on Facebook but I'm on my kindle all the time not the computer!! Please get candy crush saga on the kindle!!!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|This sounded like something I would really like.  I think I downloaded the app, but all I get when I try to play is a black screen.  The  description said it was free.  Maybe not?
B0093DFMGC|4.0|As dozens of other reviewers probably mention, the premise of LOOPER is that the Master Criminal Gang of the future cannot afford to have any dead bodies around that might be used as evidence against them, so, with a Time Machine, they send trouble makers thirty years into the past (bound and hooded), to be disposed of by a team of young hitmen who work for them. The gang's inflexible rule is that hitmen in the past must kill whoever is sent back in time to them, including their older selves ... or suffer \\"grave\\" consequences.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the younger self of the film's main hitman, and Bruce Willis plays that same hitman's 30-year-older self, who at some point will be sent back for Younger-Self-Gordon-Levitt to kill.<br /><br />As virtually every viewer will expect from the beginning of this film, when Older-Self-Willis arrives in the past, he escapes from his younger self.<br /><br />SPOILER #1: However, Older-Self-Willis is not just selfishly trying to prolong his own life (while putting his younger self in jeopardy); he has a special mission in the past that involves killing the younger self of the warped-genius-villain who caused the death of a woman he loves in his future world. In other words, Older-Self-Willis hopes to change the future by changing the past.<br /><br />PLOT HOLE #1 involves the killing IN THE FUTURE of the beloved woman. Why are ANY exceptions allowed to the Rule that ALL \\"hits\\" must take place in the past? The obvious answer is: This inconsistency is needed to motivate the entire main plot about Older-Self-Willis's mission ... even if that entire plot rests on quicksand.<br /><br />PLOT HOLES #2 and #3 and #4 ... and SPOILER #2: As with thousands of other Time Travel stories/movies, this one involves a recurring LOOP. And it is clear from a couple indications that this loop has already occurred at least twice before--but this is played down, and we are given no indication whether all the past loops (which may number in the billions) have been identical (clearly the most recent ones have been), and why THIS loop might be any different from them. Further, since the warped-genius-villain has encountered an Older-Self-Willis before, why does he take any chances by sending him back to the past again (and again and again)? And, since the warped-genius-villain IRONICALLY was warped as a child BY an Older-Self-Willis's attack, HOW could-or-did he ever become warped BEFORE any Older-Self-Willis went back in time and warped him? (This seems to be a FATAL FLAW in the plot, which no viewer is ever supposed to consider, especially in terms of the ending to THIS particular loop.)<br /><br />SPOILER #3: In an earlier scene, a different hitman recognized his older self when he arrived (bound and hooded) because his older self was singing his favorite song. He released his older self and then tried to hide.<br /><br />PLOT HOLES #5 and #6: The only reason the people being sent back are NOT drugged or gagged is that we (the audience) need to be shown WHAT happens to a hitman who disobeys the gang's rule. Logic would have dictated that the gang of the future should have killed people bloodlessly, with drugs or poisons, and merely shipped the corpses to the past for disposal. Logic would further dictate that an aged hitman in the future should be sent back to a different hitman in the past, not to his younger self (and that all younger selves should be kept uninformed about the killings of their future selves).<br /><br />PLOT HOLES #7 through #57: On numerous occasions, Older-Self-Willis exhibits implausible SUPER POWERS when he is confronting multiple armed opponents. For example, while unarmed, he is able to defeat his armed younger self, having already defeated at least FOUR ARMED MEN in the future; and when he is armed, he can easily defeat dozens of armed men and cause dozens of other armed men to quiver in abject terror that he will come for them.<br /><br />BUT ... WHAT SAVES THIS FILM (for me) despite all these PLOT HOLES is the ending. My favorite kind of story, whether it is found in mainstream literature, in mystery fiction, in science fiction ... whatever ... involves the sudden disclosure of a streak of unsuspected (but plausible) NOBILITY AND MORALITY in a person who had previously seemed \\"only ordinary\\" or even \\"subhuman.\\"<br /><br />THAT is what occurs at the very end of this film ... and I will not \\"spoil\\" anyone's enjoyment of it by giving more details about it.<br /><br />If I were awarding this film a letter grade, given its roller-coaster ride of negative factors that terminate in a strongly positive and EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING conclusion, in my judgment it deserves a solid \\"B\\" ... perhaps almost a weak \\"B+\\".or me) despite all these PLOT HOLES is the ending.

B00785P2QC|5.0|This is just like Sims city but free great for on the go play if you don't want to pay for the Sims
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is Great movie to rent or buy, there's Action drama killing love hate. I really love it cant wait for more.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I was trying to learn this little game.  thought it was cute, but then it locked me out and wouldn't let me play anymore.
B001974DG0|5.0|To me the book is way better than the movie.  It gives you a better insight to all the characters, even the dog.
B00B4804KS|5.0|LOVE this movie in 3D! Highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action-packed 3D movie! The special effects are awesome!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was so emotionally powerful. What a great recommendation. The characters were brought to life in great detail. Wonderful!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The film was great and it's worth having a copy on hand for classroom discussion of issues like racism and dealing with death and dying.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Although I know most of the tips contained in this title I have struggled to begin the process of decluttering and simplifying my life and my space. Here is the inspiration and practical advice to start: get rid of one thing a day that is extraneous to my life. One thing. That sweater from Mom that isn't my style, that is taking up space in a drawer, causing me guilt for not liking it - frustration at Mom not knowing I wouldn't like it. Gone. With that one first purge I eliminate the item, the guilt and the frustration. Finally I begin in bite-size pieces to clutter. This short book is quickly consumed and put into action. It's not the stuff but the emotional baggage attached to the stuff that Ms Jay helps to declutter in order to begin to simplify and organize.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie most of the way thru. The ideas about gravity and the effects there-of make it a one of a kind experience. however I felt I would have enjoyed it more had I turned it off before the last 20min~, The ending was just far to generic.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Special effects are fantastic and rivaled only by Inception<br />+Idea behind the whole movie has so much depth and imagination<br />+good choice of actors/actresses<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Ending<br />-I felt some of the soundtrack was ill-placed.<br /><br />Would I watch it again?  Yes(but I might turn it off before the end)
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love this movie. I know it's a little immature for a 21 year old to watch this movie over and over because of the cheese factor and Nicholas Hoult's hotness - but even disregarding that the story has special meaning. It draws parallels to real world issues such as overpopulation and conspiracy theories, the journey from deep depression to healing with love, and it does it with humor. (and hot actors. hehe)<br />It never comes right out and says anything, but this movie possibly could be talking about a conspiracy theory, such as the government creates mass population-reducing plan where people turn into people-eaters. (hey it's smart, if not extremely cruel).<br />In addition, it can be looked at like a representation of what it feels like to go from very depressed to being alive, and to get there with love. When you are depressed, you feel a little like you're dead and the rest of the population feels like they're \\"living\\" while you're \\"undead.\\"<br />Without reading between the lines, the movie is entertaining for even a nine year old who would not analyze the depths and possible meanings, and would just like to watch a funny movie with their mom and dad. It's a great movie for the entire family. The \\"bonies\\", or scary skeleton heartless zombie creatures, are a little scary if your child is prone to nightmares. Other than that, this is a great movie for everybody.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|TR2 is way better than the first one because it has better flow and the turns actually make you move instead of straight line the whole time and ziplines are amazing
B009186JYI|5.0|I would recommend this to many of my old rock and roll friends.  It will definitely add a lot to people's music collections.  The Stones will always rock on....
B006OCM0G0|3.0|its a fun game because like if ur into to cooking u would want to do this and its cool how like u get diffrent types of food or drinks and like the way they look and stuff like that.  I would recommend this if ur into COOKING
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter and I really enjoy playing this game. It is interesting enough to keep both of us wanting to play. It is the first thing she wants to play when she ask for my kindle.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is really fun! There is a lot of things to unlock so you don't get tired of it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun and challenging game but didn't take to long to finish no more then a couple of hours. Need more rooms!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|One of the best movies I have bought in a long time. Acting and singing is great for one of the classic Broadway productions.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great book by James Rollins.  Fasten your seat belt this books takes the reader on an extraordinary journey.  The characters are like old friends by now.  Painter, Grey and Monk etc., are in true form rushing around the world to accomplish their mission at all cost.  This book will definitely keep you up at night turning pages.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is beast i have to tell my friends about this. my dad even plays thiswhen i showed him how
B0000013GT|5.0|I have always loved this album but when I heard that Big Boy voted for Gary Johnson, I had to actually make the purchase.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Watched through the whole series. The discs are all in great shape, we had no problems at all with playback. I own several full-series sets for various shows, and perfect playback has only happened one other time. That alone garners five stars. In addition, the packaging is classy and displays nicely on the shelf and the bonuses (pilot script, special features, etc.) are fun. This puts a great show in an appropriately awesome format.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. fun to play when I have time to kill. or just chilling. I am having fun. its awesome!!!!:)
034580404X|2.0|This trilogy is not what I thought it would be, to each their own, but I like a little more substance in my reading and am really surprised that this book took off the way it did, all the way to a movie???? REALLY????
B00BHO7M5O|3.0|Third in the \\"rebuild\\" of the original series and advances nothing.  It's all action and whiny Shinji - Will he ever quit whining?  Otherwise there is no character advancement - the others hardly speak.  The story moves forward 14 years, yet the EVA kids have not aged, and Shinji has been in a coma all this time.  It's several large battles and extended scenes with Shinji whining again.  I don't know what they're trying to accomplish but I watched it twice and it's a real failure as a standalone film.  They've turned the EVA storyline upside down, yet fail to explain why any of this has occurred.  May be it's the translation, but I doubt it.  6/10, and I'm being kind.  Well, have to wait another year to find out how this mess ends - again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is too cool to love!<br /><br />if you don't get it your sick or something!<br />get it now! if you don't you'll be sorry!
B0080CL0HM|4.0|The story is interesting but frankly dated.  It was hard for me to to identify with or care with most of the characters.  However the actors were all very good and succeeded in making this almost ridiculous tale believable.  I don't usually care for Uma Thurman but she was wonderful here.  Likewise Christina Ricci.  Kristin Scott Thomas played against type and was, as usual, very good.  I've never seen Robert Pattinson so he was a complete surprise and a very pleasant one.  He has a terrific range of emotions from cruel to vulnerable to charming to stupid and a few others. The film is worth watching for his performance.  And then there's Paris, in the 1890's which is a plus.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game is very challenging with lots of twist and bumps. the car is hard to handle at first but you get use to it quickly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My favourite game it is sloppily awesome I love love love love love this game Apollo much I give it 1000 stars. <3
B009RH973I|2.0|Although I liked the pink color that I selected, I didn't like that I had to partically remove the kindle unit in order to charge it.  This case does not have built-in &#34;cut-outs&#34; for the adapter.  So I ended it returning it for another case.  Fortunately, the return process is smooth and simple!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is awsome!And its also edgicasional.It teaches people at young age how build craft and create.It also teatches so much more!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really love playing this game.  Don't wait, download it now and you'll wonder where the last two hours went!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|This movie is very creepy.Well worth $10 for those who like Horror classics.I must say I saw the remake of &#34;The Fog'<br />before I saw this John Carpenter version.Its nowwhere near as cheesy as the remake is.Well worth the time to watch Halloween and The Thing and The Fog all together.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|We all enjoyed working together to escape. Fun game! Uses problem solving skills and math skills. My five yr old even got into it with me.
0525952926|5.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett and have enjoyed reading the second book of this trilogy; best Follett in quite a while.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I cant wait for more rooms. I really enjoyed the ones that are here. Please make them as quickly as possible. Thanks
1439102813|5.0|From an intelligent, successful woman's point of view, this book gives a first-person account of what it is like to start slipping away. It helped ME understand this progressive disease in a human, non-clinical way. I gave a copy to a friend whose husband is starting to slip away as well.
B00969PR18|4.0|This app is fine and is very useful, really I recomend to get it, besides it is free. With this every one can know where we are all the time.
B007IWG3WC|4.0|did not know there was a Mako shark. very good movie special effects were good ,would highly recommend to all movie lovers to watch this movie
B007FIY3VW|4.0|For Kindle Fire HD this was a perfect fit. I use it for studying and editing all my existing Word notes and study guides for school. I can`t  see spending  $14.99 for this capability when this one works more than adequately. To be fair, I have not used excel or power point yet. So for this reason I give it only 4 stars.
B00CATONCA|1.0|Season three is the worst. The Governor is a joke. It could have been so much more real, and real brutal. Read the books. They will not let you down.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Badly written, incredibly limited vocabulary, marginal story line, boring, annoying &#34;inner goddess&#34; constantly mentioned, I read it because of all the hype it was receiving.  Wish I'd not wasted the time or the money.  The sex scenes were so badly written it did little for the libido.  Not my thing but there's obviously a huge market for badly written escapism.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVER. The first time I tried Minecraft was on my cousin's computer and I LOVED it, A LOT. I say it is worth every penny and it is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is creative.<br />P.S.if you get Minecraft Pocket Edition you HAVE to try out the seeds: nyan or EVER GREEN.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Rented the movie to watch on 1080P television.<br />  The story, while familiar, was given some unique twists. The photography was good, and the sound level was consistent, which is great. Some movies you have to scramble for the remote to turn the volume up to head dialogue.<br />  Of course when it comes to dialogue, Shakespeare it ain't, but there were a few good lines.<br />  The best part of the movie for me was that there were about a hundred opportunities to make political comments during it. It seems that incompetency and bungling of responsibility isn't confined to the here and now.<br />  On the whole, I liked it,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very challenging game. the puzzles are fantastic. graphics are very clear. I can't wait for the rest of the levels!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this to charge a kindle fire. It works fine and I have had no problems. I use it with both the kindle plug and other usb compatible plugs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played so far and I'm only nine years old. I get to beat my friends on Facebook and brag about it. I recommend you play something similar like temple run 1,2,and 3
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I could not put this down! I really understood this woman's character and motivation and hated to see it end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was a five star game had great graphics and I love the people you put in like frank he was the best in my opinion and king
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My whole family enjoyed this game on Kindle Fire and Android phones. The puzzles were hard enough to be challenging without being too arcane or frustrating. Looking forward to more!
0979019710|5.0|Life had thrown major curve balls my way.  After suffering the loss of 3 family members in 3 months, I was then diagnosed with breast cancer.  There was so much loss, in such a short period of time - who had time to grieve.  Following the recovery from double mastectomy and reconstruction life was starting to get back to \\"normal\\"...and yet nothing was normal.  The grief was finally setting in and out of the blue a co-worker \\"gifts\\" me a copy of Hal's book Miracle Morning- divine intervention!  His story is so inspiring, and if you no longer know what normal is - why not create the most amazing new normal possible.  I embraced the concepts, immediately began putting his words into action and I am already feeling the change.  GREAT book for all readers.  No matter where you are in this journey we call life, why not make it the best!  Thank you Hal, for sharing your heart and mind with us all
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a fun game but I don't like how you have pay for the extras. But other than that I would recommend to anyone who wants to burn time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool app.  It needs more levels.  It can be very challenging.  Very fun.  My wife says she would die in there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is the beast game ever it is so addicting but the golden mystery boxes are pretty rubbish I spent 4days and 3 hours trying to get one and all I got was a key but it is still a good game
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I dont like this game its boring and i wasted my money for this. I tried to  be nice but o well
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic but there are things that can be improved or added to make it better .like for a start the rider should have their heels down like a real rider would. And the saddles should all say whether they are english or western because it looks like something in between. And then for the most part  wonderful game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes you want to skip work and stay home to see what is on the next floor. Very challenging.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is all I could have asked for at the price point.<br /><br />The one con that was correct that i read earlier is how light the mouse comes out of the box.<br />But if you put in every single weight it feels much nicer.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I must say I do have mixed emotions about this book. I do enjoy the adventures of Agent Pendergast but the story within the story I found rather drab. This caused me to put the book down a number of times until the main story resumed. As a whole I truly enjoy the writings of Preston and Child. However, one main character at a time would have sufficed this time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat, loved the plot and storyline. Definitely a must read for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 11 year old son and I had a great time playing this game together. Very fun and it makes you use your brain.
1594488886|4.0|From the very moment of your birth, your entire destiny builds toward a single moment:  Marriage.  Often this moment comes when you're still a child;  in the West you would be wearing braces and putting up One Direction posters.  But what comes afterwards?  A life of humiliation and servitude; a race to bear son after son; the complete erasure of your individual identity.  What if your husband proves a monster?  What if you have other dreams?  What if you aspire to earn degrees and build a career and raise daughters who are strong and independent in their own right?  These are the questions that Hosseini seeks to answer in \\"A Thousand Splendid Sons,\\" a sort of love letter to the women of Kabul: The \\"thousand splendid suns\\" cited in the title.  In \\"The Kite Runner,\\" we were treated to a brief but shocking scene in which a woman is stoned to death for adultery at the football stadium.  In this novel, we follow the experiences of two women very much like her; we have the opportunity to see the world through her eyes. It is a world that is absolutely harrowing, almost without hope.<br /><br />For me, the most horrifying scene of the entire novel occurs when the Taliban announces its new laws for women:<br /><br />You must not step outside your residence at any hour of the day.<br />You must never show your face.<br />You must not speak unless spoken to.<br />You must not look men in the eye.<br />You must not laugh in public.<br />You must not paint your fingernails; otherwise your fingers will be cut off.<br /><br />Which all boil down to one basic rule:  You have no right to exist, unless a man allows it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I think that this was a great game because it reminds me of wwll and my great grandfather was in that war
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. Very good ending. Great way to wrap it up. It was a very easy read
B0032O6S4I|5.0|My granddaughter spends hours with this toy.  She's got a great imagination and loves the animals.  They have a lot of detail.
B001P3SA94|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and the music is great.  This is definitely a movie for musicians to watch - they would really appreciate it more than most.  Just great!
B000FBJF7I|5.0|As with all of the No.1 ladies books ... excellent, well written, good philosophy too. intend to try to catch up with all the rest of the no. 1 books.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Well after living with this album for about a week now, I can safely make these statements. I think the album is the best since Mindcrime and is on par with Rage/Warning. Is that to say this album sounds anything like those albums? At moments it does. It sounds like an album that could of been between Mindcrime and Empire, taking the musical superiority of the EP through Mindcrime era and combining it with the hooky sensibilities of Empire. Is that to say it sounds dated? Oh no. This album is firmly rooted in the new century. Queensryche managed to make an album that sounds like their classic material, yet sounds fresh, new and invigorated! Songs like Redemption and Spore sound very modern peppered with some classic metal sensibilities.<br /><br />In addition this whole album calls back to their entire catalog. Appropriately enough, A World Without recalls the creepy atmosphere of Suite Sister Mary and features guest vocals from Pamela Moore! Don't Look Back and Fallout sounds like a modernized version of something you might find on their EP or Warning. Open Road even gives a vibe of something from Promised Land. I really feel there is not a bad song on it.<br /><br />The live tracks are a good bonus if you own the deluxe edition. Queen of The Reich is one of my favorite QR songs, but new singer Todd La Torre really took En Force and Prophecy and made them his own. Todd does a very good job of getting their former singer's vibe, and while occasionally sounding like him also leaves plenty of room to add his own voice. I also like how \\"new guy\\" Parker Lundgren wrote one of the best songs on the album, Where Dreams Go To Die. Somehow he was able to nail the QR sound. It is also refreshing that not only has the band accepted his input but have celebrated it.<br /><br />Now as much as i'm praising this album I am prepared to talk about some of the negative aspects. This album is master way too loud. It does sound great in my car, but on inferior sound systems it can getdistorted and crackly. Also lost is the vibe to the classic records, which of course is a problem that plagues all new albums. Does this stop me from enjoying the album? Hell no. I got over these issues very quick. I have seen some criticism of the length of the album, which I personally don't share. My attention span prefers shorter albums.<br /><br />It is fantastic to see a band that I wrote off as being dead many years ago release something that I feel i'll enjoy as much as their classic cataloge. It is also good to see that as a result, they are rebuilding their fanbase very quickly. Their former singer fired several shots across their bow, but in general, Queensryche's only reaction was to drop a monster of a release and let their work speak for itself. It is a good time to be a Queensryche fan.<br /><br />I ranked it 5 stars based on Amazon's rating, but rank it 8 out of 10 personally.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|amazing imagination by the author, who would think of such things. movie followed book extremely well, too ... but I could fast forward through the boring parts. somewhat too graphic sometimes re. the killing, eating.
B001LYD2JU|5.0|This Cd is a must in any serious metal/rock collection. Michael Schenker proves without a doubt that he can survive on his own with an incredibly solid effort. More incredible music could have been produced if he was able to keep this band together for more than 2 albums. I highly recommend this one as well as MSG and the live masterpiece One Night At Budokan! Cry For The Nations!!! Rock on!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was pretty fun . i just wish there was more levels. challenging enough to make ya think but not too much so where you get frustrated and throw your device in a fit of electronic induced rage.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|This album is incredible from start to finish with not even one bad song in the bunch. Simply put, one of the greatest rock masterpieces ever created. I'm actually disappointed that anyone would even consider rating this less than five stars. Truly a historic album in every sense of the word and made at a time when music still had soul! Highlights include Space Child, Rock Bottom, Doctor Doctor, Crystal Light, Too Young to Know, and any other song you want to name!
B00009AOBI|5.0|I was so excited to finally find this movie on DVD. One of my favorites growing up as a kid.
0399246665|2.0|I love Eric Carle's books so I was surprised to find this book a disappointment.  The color words and the pictures are helter skelter in the book.  I think it's a very confusing format for a very young child learning his or her colors.
B009IJJ712|1.0|As a true Sherlock Holmes fan, this is so much less than acceptable.  It might not be bad if it didn't try to be something it just isn't - Sherlock Holmes.
0446519456|5.0|I am getting into this kind of thing and I felt that if I want to know what this subject is all about, then Dr. Weiss was the author to check out.  I was impressed by the thoroughness that he puts in each chapter.  Was easy to follow and it resonated with me completely.  I will definitely continue to read his other books.  Looking forward to learning all I can from Dr. Brian Weiss.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Anyone who likes the Game og thrones serie will love the books. Wonderful detail and description of the caracters. When reading the book you feel you actually are living in the seven kingdoms and seeing the beauty of the place.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Time killer but some glitches fixed better than before for kindle fire suits awesome upgrades cool perfect time killer period
B00BX3KZAS|5.0|Ever since I was introduced to CoB with Hatecrew I always anticipate one of their releases. This album is no different. I actually like this a little bit more than RRF. But not as much as Hatecrew. Anyways it is classic Alexi. Tight, scorching solos. A lot more just a** kicking, heavier riffs. No doubt about the American thrash and early hairband influence but with just the right touch of their Finnish heritage. Bodom continue to evolve their catalog and this album is more brutal than their last few. Awesome
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I was very excited for this album to come out. After hearing the first 2 singles (Hollow and Stone), I thought this was going to be a throwback to the heavier dirtier sound of the old Alice In Chains. I was disappointed.  This is a decent album, but I was expecting a little more.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I play on touchpad, items are too easy To find. Game is To easy to finish, Not Worth 3 euro. The story is okay but Not very exciting.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Anyone who has read the books might wonder if the movies will meet expectations, I am here to tell you... they do!! \\"The Hobbit\\" is no different!! They obviously took a few liberties in making the movie, but I promise they did everything very well and I am greatful! The makers of this movie and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies are true artists!! A must see for all.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk has always had a special place in my heart since I was in middle school, but now their beats have evolved just like me and what I want from dance music.  This album feels like a tribute to the 70s through the lens of David Bowie.  Lots of danceable beats and the album flows, it's not just a bunch of random songs jammed together.  Get it
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie truly is fantastic! I have watched it multiple times lol. The children love it as well as myself and my husband, it is a great family movie, full of adventure!! I am so happy this movie was made!!
0802473156|5.0|Funny! I learned as much about my own love language as I did about my spouse's.  It's one of those books that one should read and read again.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|This movie had potential, but sadly disappointing. Why can we not make a scary intense movie nowadays? Started off with promise, then we just wanted to throw things at our t.v. and boo and hiss, lol if we didn't love our t.v. so much, (bought on amazon by the way and awesome!!) we would have!! Sorry to say, but do not waste time or money, you'll wish you hadn't
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Brilliant app easy to install and use SOUND and colour is good fast to load number one alround<br />Even the wife can use it
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I was truely expecting not to care for this movie, boy am I happy to be wrong! It is not like the first \\"Wizard of Oz\\", so do not expect to see Dorothy or Toto in this one! This is the story of how the wizard comes to Oz. My husband and I truly enjoyed this movie and plan to own it and watch it as often as possible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good app  very easy to use pages are clear and well spaced out not all named in to a small space easy to move between pages
1442359919|5.0|This is a really good one by Stephen King. It's got a spooky element to it, but the spooky part sits in the back seat to the journey a young man takes in coming to terms with a broken heart. Trust in the King, the master story teller. There is a whole lot more to the story. It has some thrills, chills, intrigue and very interesting characters. And watch out because King doesn't pull his emotional punches.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|*note that i only played the demo so... like the other reviews said, the trial is very short.  and i might not have got the full experience/all the items survivalcraft has to offer (however i am positive that all the items were in the demo)<br /><br />With that said, survivalcraft didn't have anywhere near as many items and blocks as minecraft.  it did however have a bigger variety of the things it did have (see below).<br />I like the graphics more on survivalcraft than minecraft.  not so much because the blocks looked cooler, but because most non-block items weren't square! (pumpkins, the sun and moon, clouds, animals, etc.)<br />I didn't have time to explore the crafting table, but i liked the furnace on survivalcraft because it had the option of heating two items at once, probably to fuse them together.<br />The only other major difference i noticed was that instead of redstone and torches, they had copper wire. that means they that you could also craft a battery, and you could craft a block that had a wire inside of it (very nice compared to the restrictions of redstone placement).  because of the lack of redstone torches,  &quot;and or&quot; gates had to be crafted (the compact gates would be nice on minecraft).  Lastly, i didn't notice any pistons or powered rails or anything like the things that ran on redstone in minecraft (i honestly don't know what the wire is for)<br /><br />items/blocks (small list of the few i noticed)<br />weapons<br />mc: bow and arrow<br />sc: spear, machete (instead of sword)<br /><br />ores<br />mc: lapis, redstone, emerald<br />sc: copper, sulpher, saltpepper, germanium<br /><br />animals<br />mc: octopus, sheep<br />sc: shark, stingray, horse, birds (that fly)<br /><br />other blocks<br />mc: dyed wool<br />sc: painted planks
B001BANK32|4.0|Good story. An exceptional examination into the minds of people, and their reactions to abuses suffered when they were young…
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This gift was for my granddaughter's 28th birthday and she was happy to get it per her request on her wish list.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|I work with students with Autism and was quite impressed with this movie. The acting was very good. It would be a great movie for parents and educators both!
B008NW67E0|4.0|A gift for my 28th granddaughter for her  birthday as she  was very pleased that I bought it for her from her wish list.
B007G92QGO|5.0|My first read on my new IPad, this became an emotional experience as I travelled overseas, sometimes having to leave it untouched for days, but always easily restarted when I got the chance to delve. Every development seemed revelational yet plausible, and I could identify with the feelings of both mother Laurie and father Andy. It was compelling and had me hooked from the beginning. I loved it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The game is fun and all but really? You do not want to pay money for all the good stuff.  Wow..That's realistic NOT! That like telling a fish not to swim! The scientist guy says &quot;It's too heavy to move. Whine Whine.&quot; Like a little girl! You should have free access to ALL animals and dinosaurs. Equal distribution to the people! What is this world coming to, people!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I love this game, however I love Candy Crush Saga more!! I hope it comes to kindle fire very very soon!!!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Great game and difficulty levels, enough 4 the whole family and beginners 2. Small children can learn 2 play 2. They throw everything at u, and i have not found a puzzle that has more than one way to finish it. Ive been playing this one since it was first out and luv it for a brain wakeup in the morning with coffee.<br />Keep up the good work guys.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can You Escape is a fun puzzle game that makes you think, but isn't too difficult to be frustrating. The free version is well worth a download. Hopefully more levels will be added soon.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love the different games and I love the challenge of trying to improve my time in each game.  Good brain exercise.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|I love this movie. The story and acting was excellent. Dicaprio, as usual, gave all his heart in portraying the main character. However, this movie requires full attention in order to follow the events.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved watching this movie. First I rented it and then I bought it since I figured I would watch it again. Well worth the time to watch this movie.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have waited for Blu-ray version of this title for some time. Knowing that it should come out sooner or later and after viewing this issue I was not disappointed. The picture is crisp and color no short of sparkling. Its special feature was made in a very enjoyable and informative way revealing some point in time of the real TS. Lawrence and also some notes on the cast that make viewing them interesting.<br />The only feature of this David Lean's film that comes short of &#34;Doctor Zhivago&#34; is the theme. I'd prefer Maurice Jarre's &#34;Lara's Theme&#34; to this movie's overture anytime.
B005LAJ212|4.0|I enjoyed this series because it was soo vindictive and story lines were unexpected. The clothing worn by the stars, mostly in the Hamptons, was up to the minute and IMO mostly tasteful. I am planning to order Season 2 when it comes out.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|What's to say really? It's Walt and Jesse doing what they do. If you own one, you must own all. GREAT SHOW!!
B0012DT9VK|5.0|You may be wondering, &#34;How many times can Tim Burton possibly use Johnny Depp and his other regulars in a movie, and still come up with something you haven't already seen?&#34;  Well let me assure you, this makes at least one more.  It has been a very long time since I read the book, so I Honestly can't comment on the movie's accuracy to the book.  I can, however, say that the basic plot is the same, with possibly less deviation from the book than the first movie. Notice I say less deviation.  I do not say less enhancement, because Burton did add tons of clever and hilarious (albeit slightly creepy) little quips touches.  I laughed out loud, delightedly, even uncontrollably, on numerous occasions throughout this movie.  I have seen it more than once by now, and still take great pleasure in the little puns and in the portrayal of characters.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are rendered with great taste.  Charlie is the unassuming and obviously pure and good-hearted boy he was in the book, as are his parents and grandparents.  Augustus, Violet, Veruca, and Mike TV are over the top, obnoxious, and despicable, in a way that makes their individual failures quite gratifying. I get a good kick out of Violet's mother, who has the most intensely expectant stare anyone has ever seen.  If any character was changed from the book, it's Willy Wonka.  I'm sure he wasn't nearly as disturbed, creepy, and awkward as he is in this movie.  The movie does, however, explain the reasons for his ways due to his tough, anti-candy father, and his isolation in the chocolate factory.  He also comes around to likeability as the movie progresses, undergoing the necessary personal growth that is required in a true hero.<br /><br />As you can see, I gave the movie 5 stars.  The entertainment value is there, without a doubt.  As is the case with many Burton films, it may be a little creepy for very young children.  But anyone with an appreciation for the quirky, the colorful, and the touching, should love Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app as a writer, but I also found a couple of bugs, though are relatively small. I write mostly using Google Docs, but for notes this is by far superior.<br />One of the bugs I've found involved the read out loud option, the one where the synthetic voice reads what you've written. I wrote about an entire page of notes involving a story I`m working and hit that button so I could listen to the notes as I wrote, but it didn't do anything, so I sat there for a bit, still writing, thinking it was loading, but it never started. So I had to break my line of thought and see what was going on. Those notes still aren't working but like I said, that's a tiny problem to an otherwise fantastic app. I definitely recommend it.

B00BW0QC8G|5.0|I picked up a laptop recently, and I've been hauling it, it's power cord, and mouse here and there in a shoulder messenger bag.  That was working just OK, but when I had a chance to check out this backpack I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />I have an Acer Aspire 5560 Series laptop.  It's 15\\" x 10\\" x 1.25\\" and it's a perfect fit for the designated laptop sleeve built into this backpack.  The laptop compartment has thick foam protection on both the front and back.  Oh, if you have a laptop any bigger than this (length x width) this back will be too small.  Frankly, there aren't many laptops out there that I've seen lately that are much bigger, though there are 17\\" units around.  They won't fit in this pack.<br /><br />OK, what else?<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />1) It has a comfortable air-flow design so air can flow along your back while you have it on.  There are padded sections by each shoulder blade and the small of your back.<br /><br />2) The straps are wide, nicely padded, and fully adjustable.  If you've ever been frustrated because the snap-straps between the shoulder straps in the front are on the wrong place, this is a pack for you.  The snapping cross strap traverses up and down most of the distance of the straps.  There are also neat little velcro straps that allow you to secure the ends of straps that extend below the bottom of the shoulder straps - so this is a real plus if you don't like dangling straps.<br /><br />3) There is a webbed coat-hook loop at the top of the pack AND a large padded handle.  Yeah!<br /><br />4) Laptop/tablet zipper compartment is, as mentioned above, large enough to accommodate a 15.6\\" screen laptop.  There is also a sleeve in there that is large enough to accommodate a full sized iPad or similar sized tablet.<br /><br />5) Main zipper compartment: This is large, but padded only on the side facing the laptop compartment.  Anything in here is fully exposed to bumps and bangs.  It's good for books, binders, etc.  There is also a mesh zipper pouch (good for things you want to see at a glance when you look in this compartment.  There's also a slip-in compartment - no zipper.  This could be good for papers, folders, etc.  Oh, I like that this compartment has two zipper pulls.  Cha-ching!<br /><br />6) There is a second, smaller front zipper compartment.  It's also large enough for papers, pens, calculator, etc.  It's got mesh and non-mech slip pockets for the little stuff.<br /><br />7) There's kind of a stealth zipper pocket with a side zipper. This pocket is big enough for a modest-sized lunch bag.<br /><br />8) There is a second stealth zipper pocket that opens a thin pouch on the back of the pack under the padded lumbar support.<br /><br />9) There is also a small, plush-lined pouch at the top of the pack.  This is obviously for personal electronic devices - cell phones, ipod, etc.<br /><br />10) There's a second handle on the bottom front of the pack.  What a great idea!  This would come in handy while stowing or retrieving this from airplane overhead bins, etc.<br /><br />11) I like the rubberized zipper pulls.  They are comfortable, and all zippers operate smoothly.<br /><br />Dislikes<br /><br />1) There is only one zipper pull for the laptop compartment.  I'd prefer two.<br /><br />2) The small slip pockets in the second outer pocket won't hold things in place if the pack gets inverted.<br /><br />3) I wish the small plush zipper pocket were crush resistant like you find on the [[ASIN:B007Z4YHRG Thule EnRoute Escort Daypack for 17-Inch MacBook Pro and 10-Inch Tablets - Black (TEED-117)]].  That would make it more useful for storing things like sunglasses and increased protection of personal electronics.<br /><br />4) There are two small zipper pockets on the sides of the pack, but, well, I guess you could put your keys in there, there's a plastic loop you could clip them to, and the other one has an opening to accommodate a speaker cord.<br /><br />Wrapping things up...my laptop is already home...<br /><br />5 stars, with only a few minor shortcomings...it looks like a real winner!ready home...<br /><br />5 stars, with only a few minor shortcomings...it looks like a real winner!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. I love puzzle type games and mahjong is one of my favorites. Haven't had this app for long, but so far I have no complaints.
0670026638|4.0|A lovely narrative, with deeply developed characters, at least three very interesting and well-described settings, comedic and tragic phrasing and plot turns, and the perplexing use of the author's first name as one of the story's protagonists.  This book was on the brink of five stars for me, but it bogged down in parts so I had to bump it down to four.  The zen consideration of time is really thought provoking.  What to make of another protagonist's first name being a homonym for the word \\"now\\"??
1591841666|5.0|The dip gave me perspective about when to quit and when to stick in a way I've never considered. Excellent book.
0062255657|3.0|Maybe Gaiman is just proving the point that Lettie Hempstock makes when she says, \\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either...  The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups.\\"  A point validated each time I see the middle-aged face looking back at me in my bathroom mirror.  Nonetheless, I would recommend this as a great book for 12 year olds.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can’t believe that I spent almost $13.00 on this book. Is there a full refund or an exchange available?
0812982622|5.0|Beautifully written and intricately plotted.  A view into a real world with a 1984 feel.  Excellent choice for book clubs.

B003VANOFY|4.0|**Updated 07/24/2013(see below)**<br /><br />First the good:<br /><br />The device is extremely well built, and very comfortable and this is coming from someone who has to wear glasses.<br /><br />Now, the bad:<br /><br />The software you have to install for this device is absolutely terrible.  When its running, the headset has trouble syncing with the receiver, there is frequent audio ducking (automatic volume adjustment for those that are unfamiliar with the term) even when its turned off in Windows.  Also, its seems to have trouble detecting when the mic is turned on or off.  I have to restart the software every time I turn on my machine because it incorrectly detects that the mic is activated (even though the little red light on the end of the mic says otherwise), and I have to sit there and listen to background noise if I don't.  None of these issues occur with the built-in Windows driver.  Now it makes sense why this device was built so sturdily:  because it will need to handle the inevitable abuse it will get when the customer gets frustrated with the crappy software.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />So I've had about a month or so to get used to this device, all the while contemplating a suitable replacement.  The unfortunate news is there just isn't a whole lot of options as far as wireless gaming headsets go.  Logitech, like it or not, currently has the best offering.  Now that being said, after using the device for about a month or so, I have actually grown to like it.  That doesn't mean that the software glitches or quirks have gone away.  No, all that means is I have found ways to either ignore or workaround them and now I'm actually very happy with my purchase (hence the upgraded rating from 3 to 4).  What does that mean to the prospective buyer?  Well, I would say if you have a fairly high tolerance for dealing with buggy software then by all means, purchase this headset.  Its going to take a few weeks, but once you've gotten used to it like I have, youwill definitely not be disappointed.  If you don't have a high tolerance, you may need to look into options for wired headsets, because this is likely the best option you're likely to get as far as wireless is concerned.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will issue a cautionary recommendation for this headset, but like I stated above: buyer beware.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is an extremely addicting game, a great way to pass the time when you don't hav anything more productive to be doing

B004Z2TUGE|2.0|so, we get an interesting introduction and all through the beginning of the movie, you are actually interested, until the main character goes to school. he sees a girl through a window which means that he will fall directly in love with her. the main thing i noticed was how well.. dumb our protagonist is: he is very motivated to go to school, but shows little interest in education ''so and so class was boring''. this character is incredibly predictable, when he saw the nerdy kid, i knew he was going to become a good friend...<br />as i said earlier, he is very stupid in the sense, he has to stay undercover so he becomes the boyfriend of a girl that he saw got sent to the office for posting a lot of pictures on the internet of everyone. our main character is a bit of a d*** with her, an example would be when his girlfriend (who mumbles every line that i actually had to add subtitles) sent a text about what is going on, he simply ignored.<br />my favorite moment that showed his intellect was when he knew the cops were on him, and the aliens and he should be running, where does he go? to the school, along with the girl that he showed little emotion to (barely hesitated when dropping her at the end) hence risking her life, all that to develop the pictures from the camera she gave him. and no, nothing on those pictures are actually important to the movie, except maybe getting the protagonist go to school. what he should have done is have ditched her by telling her it is for her own safety. after seeing a car being flipped she would probably think that that is a good idea.<br />the powers in the movie involve being great at parkour, super strength and telekinesis. oh yeah, it would be nice for the movie to precise when it skips a few months.<br />back to his awesome powers that he never takes full advantage of. for example for most of the fight scenes he forgot he could just pick up a baddie and sling him off a mile up.<br />heck he could have stopped baddie who stabs hisfake father in the hand that causes his death. yeah, someone can be thrown on to a window a floor high, get slung onto a pole, but being stabbed in the hand is what kills him. talk about the opposite of nuking the fridge.<br />all that being said, the final climax was pretty cool and showed all the clips taken for the trailer. so it was a (frying the coke finale)<br />of all the characters, by far the most interesting one is the dog that he got, as the audience didn't know on who's side he is on during most of the movie, which was very interesting, and as the audience knows that this is not a normal dog, this character became quite interesting.<br />but still, 2/3ds of the movie is designated to the protagonist at school, which wasn't very interesting. as it was quite boring and so is his love romance with mumbling girl.<br /><br />this movie reminded me of a book series the power of five (which could be interesting as a movie)<br />and after a bit of research, filming begun before the book was even published!<br /><br />so, i wouldn' recommend it at all, storm breaker (same actor) was way better, and that says a lot
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is so addicting! And great graphics for the kindle fire! GET THIS APP!!! Its great for all ages
B005NFVZTM|4.0|so,we come back for a third time to the concentration camps (i think) and we see magneto again, but we go further and see his mother getting shot. why doesn't he kill the man/injured the man who shot his mom? or hell, why doesn't he try to save his mom, a gun to the head is less threatening than being separated by a gate?<br />anyways mom gets shot and for some reason he ends up being raised by the killer(might be mistaken there, correct me if i am wrong and i will edit that).<br />although my big problem with this movie is the ending:<br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br />so in the end, the blue shapeshifter(yeah i am bad with names) turns to the dark side without hesitations leaving behind her only friend she grew up with (yeah that is messed up)<br />and for some reasons, he recruits only some of the mutants on his team (no explanations)<br />and a obvious movie mistake: if you saw xmen3, xmen origins wolverine or xmen2(i think), in those movies where you see xavier bald and walking, but in first class, he has hair and becomes paralyzed.<br />all in all i give it 4 stars due to the large number of big errors<br /><br />but finally a good x-men movie

0307960471|3.0|First Nesbo book I read.  Definitely a story teller. Well written, satisfying the rules of grammar and elements of a mystery story.  Unfortunately for me, this is the last of the Detective Harry Hole series because he is killed at the end of the tale by his &#34;adopted&#34; son.<br />Hole, a former police officer does things which is against the &#34;code&#34; of a police officer.  So we have a plausibility conflict with how a decent human being should respond to situations.  Its like he has no conscience and isn't responsible for what might happen because of his decisions.  Not a great book like the Larson trilogy (Girls with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.) His style, (Nesbo) is probably similar in his other books so I don't believe I will be reading them.  I do like the cover art of all his books. Very unique and well contemplated.<br />Sorry Mr. Nesbo.  BB

B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris did the worst thing you can do to your characters, she gave up on them, but it started with DAG.  Then she did the next worst thing, she insulted her fans instead of looking in the mirror.<br /><br />For years she has stepped up and admitted to continuity errors and this one is the worst of all, every law and rule went out the window.  What do her characters and fans get in the end, the same Sookie we met in the bar with nothing to look forward to.  Everything special about her taken away by her creator.<br /><br />Sadly Ms. Harris forgets that should she start another series or try to make up for it in one of her short stories as she's attempted before, this time the \\"entitled\\" will not forget.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I can't stop playing it is just so much fun the monsters are cute and fun to play with I love this game.
0553801473|3.0|Well written, but Martin didn't tie up all the ends (or even most of them) of a complex series of plot lines, leading one to believe that another volume is needed. I thought vol 5 would be the end. I guess not.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but the dialogue at times was so richly written with 'olde worlde' speech that I at times admit my attention wondered and I began thinking of pie. If I watched this movie like I would read a book, maybe each deep word of wisdom and babbling blurb or humor would sink in...or I would re-read that line.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I have used these headphones for over twenty years now and I have generally paid around $10 per pair. There are two problems with them.<br /><br />One, the wire over time breaks near the earbuds so the headphone needs to be replaced two or three times a year. The cord is too thin and not strong enough.<br /><br />Two, Sony has discontinued them and I do not see a replacement on their website.<br /><br />I would pay more for a similar, better quality and longer lasting product.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had doubts all the way through this book about whether the kid was guilty or innocent. All the way through reading I went back and forth between the wife's point of view and the husband's point of view of their son. In the end it was a frightening look at how parents view their kids. Whether the viewpoint is accurate or not.

B004QNVQK0|5.0|In casually browsing Amazon.com's stock of Ozzy Osbourne music, I decided what other people had to say about the NEWER (2011) vinyl releases of the classic Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman albums. However, MANY of the first, easily visible reviews on the 2011 vinyl releases are for the 2002 re-issues for these albums on CD, which is COMPLETELY inaccurate as the 2011 releases feature the original recordings, intact, remastered!<br /><br />Now it is true, that prior to the 2011 releases, that the prior re-issues from 2002, were hideous abominations of what once were very great albums under Ozzy Osbourne, with the work of the late Randy Rhoads on guitar. The horror that were those releases, were that they featured re-recorded drum and bass guitar tracks, due to a lawsuit the Osbournes were going through from the session players that recorded the original tracks, over un-payed royalties. So, they eliminated their recorded tracks from the albums, and had them re-recorded by Osbourne's then current lineup in 2002.<br /><br />So without further adieu, here is what I have to say for the releases. I ended up getting the box set which included not only the vinyl records, but also the CD's and a 30th anniversary DVD, as well as a poster, coffee-table book with pictures AND a replica golden cross just like the one Ozzy Osbourne has.<br />Anyway, the vinyl records, are outstanding! Pressed on 180 gram vinyl (VERY thick vinyl versus the regular records anyone can come across when going for vinyl records), the remastering is outstanding. In comparison to the records to the CD's, it does actually sound like a different mixing was used for the records, which hasn't been heard before for these classic tracks, and a VERY much welcome new sound for the songs.<br /><br />This simply will not disappoint any Osbourne fan, and even for new listeners, I recommend the 2011 vinyl remasters for Blizzard of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Gorgeous, breathtaking scenery.  Marvelous actors.  Researched carefully...and, given the few fragments left of the pagan Viking culture...wonderfully imagined.  The best series on TV!  I can hardly wait for Season Two!  This was recommended to me mout-to-mouth...and I have passed on to scores of avid followers in the same way.  The History Channel does not have the megabudget of HBO and Showtime...but they have produced a masterpiece!<br /><br />For once, the actual family lives and the politics of Viking culture are shown...and not just the fighting.  Kudos to the Director, and thank you, History Channel--for bringing this brawling, backstabbing drama of the REAL Vikings to life.  Based (loosely, but well) on the actual life of Ragnor Lothbruk (hairy breeches) who first discovered the lands to the West--England and France--this is a thrilling story of the first discovery of Christian lands...and I hope it will last long into the eventual settlements in England and the settlement of Normandy (by Ragnor's handsome brother.)  There are not enough stars for this production!<br /><br />Oh...and check out Erik Skarsgard's brother...mesmerizing shipbuilder, healer, and sorcerer:  Gustaf Skarsgard.<br /><br />We've seen these boys' talented father in 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'.  Wow!  We are being conquered by Scandinavia once more.<br /><br />Kudos to the Canadians as well...and the women are as three-dimensional and gorgeous as the menfolk.  TEN STARS at least.
0385349947|5.0|After viewing Sheryl's TED talk and following several articles about the book and her campaign, I simply had to get the book.<br />I'm a light feminist, been fighting to be treated equally for years, without waiting for anyone to \\"enable\\" me.<br />I really loved the book: she speaks to the point, gave a lot of examples, used her life story to share many experiences (from a young child to a COO executive).<br />This is a must read book for every person (man or women). Having said that, I can easily see how women would enjoy and benefit more out of it.<br />While I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about my female friends who can benefit from reading, but really reading this book.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Fun app for kids and adults alike.  I was showing it to a friend of mine and we were laughing hysterically in the restaurant.  Tom repeats everything you say and even when you laugh or make funny noises.  Very cute and entertaining.
0385349947|5.0|I love this book. As a young 20-something starting my professional career, it has been a manual for how to handle relations, promotions, growth and expectations for women in the workplace. It is difficult not to want to &#34;Lean In&#34; and challenge the status quo of how women &#34;should&#34; act/behave in leadership. I would encourage all women worldwide to open this book and pay attention to its message. It is one of hope, encouragement, inspiration and support. As I said, I love this book....
B0067R0APK|1.0|I should have listened to the reviews and not gotten this version.  I was very happy with the free version and it worked perfectly.  This platinum version does not display the map (screen is blank) when I expand them beyond the preview screen.  Therefore I cannot pan, zoom or play weather maps.  Sticking to the free version.<br /><br />UPDATE:  07-10-13.. Updated the app for version 3.1.2.7.  Map problem is not fixed.  Using Intellicast weather app now.<br /><br />UPDATE: 08-14-13.. Followed the advice of another user.  Purchased the Google Play Platinum version.  Works perfectly.  Hated to buy this app twice.. but had to know if it's the Amazon version that is the problem.  It is.  Love Amazon, but if they say it's compatible with my device, then it should be.

B00C7JGDBW|4.0|It was brave of Disney to make Oz the Great and Powerful given the fame and great respect given<br />to The Wizard of Oz (1939).  I was surprised Oz the Great and Powerful was as good as it is.<br />Much of its success is a result of some very impressive and beautiful CGI effects.<br /><br />There was a lot of disappointment, and even anger, as shown in many of the reviews here,<br />about this movie.  I don't know what people expected but I found myself fairly satisfied<br />with most of the aspects of it.<br /><br />The script is the weakest aspect, using terminology that did not exist in 1905, the time this<br />movie is set within.  People just didn't say 'WOW' and things like that, at least I don't recall<br />seeing that word in any literature from that era.  Little anachronisms like that pop up with<br />regularity and stand out like pimples on an otherwise lovely complexion.<br /><br />I didn't have a problem with any of the cast.  James Franco is very good as the charlatan<br />carnival side-show magician.  His transition to the Wizard of Oz flows naturally out of the<br />background of his character's life, and the tie-in with his Kansas life and that of his Oz life<br />is thought-provoking and touching.<br /><br />Seeing this movie made me wonder if Oz hadn't really died in the tornado and what we are<br />viewing IS his experience of heaven.<br /><br />Nods to The Wizard of Oz are frequent and apt.  The blonde woman who truly loves Oz<br />in Kansas turns out to be Auntie Em, as she tells him she has been asked by John Gale,<br />Auntie Em's husband in The Wizard of Oz, to marry him.<br /><br />Then Oz is blown away by the twister and finds Auntie Em as Glinda the Good Witch of<br />the South.  At least that is my take on it.  It's there in the script.<br /><br />The three witches are all very good as well.  Rachel Weisz is wonderful as Evanora, who<br />I think is probably the witch in the stripy stockings in The Wizard of Oz who has been<br />killed by Dorothy's falling house.<br /><br />Mila Kunis, aside from her occasional Bronx accent, is a beguiling Theodora.  Her broken-<br />heart, caused by the callous Oz, and her transformation into the<br />green-fleshed, as in poisoned by jealousy, Wicked Witch of the West, is entirely believable.<br /><br />Michelle Williams could easily have been a saccharin Disney Princess type, she looks it, but<br />she is given most of the funniest lines and she delivers them with a pretty poker face and<br />slight twitches of her mouth.  Of the three witches hers could have been the biggest flop<br />at a characterization but her Glinda is one of the big acting successes here.<br /><br />The supporting cast is by turns funny and endearing in the Disney manner.  Perhaps that<br />annoyed people, but the Quidlings, Munchkins and Dinkies are not any more cloying and<br />annoying than their 1939 counterparts.<br /><br />The China Girl, surprisingly, is not twee or irritating either, as child actors can often be,<br />especially in a Disney flick.<br /><br />Danny Elfman was the obvious choice to score this movie.  It isn't his most memorable<br />music but it is never becomes banal bombast in the action scenes, and there are plenty<br />of catchy tunes that linger in the mind but are quickly forgotten once the movie ends.<br />Unlike his best musical scores like the Batman movies, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks! and<br />Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  I think there was a missed opportunity as Theodora and Oz<br />come over the hill and encounter the Emerald City for the first time in the movie.<br />The music does not rise to occasion in my opinion.  It is not the awesome moment<br />it could have been.<br /><br />So I give this excellent DISNEY movie four stars.  It would have been top-drawer had the<br />script been more carefully worked out.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|The difference between real life and drama is that drama commands your attention through good storytelling.  Despite the historical importance of Margaret Thatcher, and countless interesting episodes in her life, \\"The Iron Lady\\" has no real plot to draw you in.  It vacillates between flashbacks of her life and a contemporary account of her decline into dementia.  But there is no obvious goal and, as a character, Thatcher fails to grow or change.  A good documentary would serve Thatcher's legacy better, certainly be more concise, and very likely more entertaining.

B008JFUNYG|5.0|Before I start, I want to say, Spoiler Alert, and it's not the original. It's similar, but the story-lines vary quite a bit. In the original, the teens go to the cabin just to have some sex-filled summer fun, but in this remade version, it's to help a drug addict kick her dependance to the curb. That's really the \\"major\\" difference, so after acknowledging that, i'll get to the rest of my review.<br /><br />The movie starts with the original archeological family who find the book of the dead. We find the father, along with some Satanist but voodoo-esque witch doctors, speaking in an unidentified language. They say to the father, the only way to free their daughter of the demon is to kill her. The choice is bodily dismemberment, live burial, or live burning. The daughter is tied to pole, doused in gasoline, and burned alive, while cursing and damning her father to hell in a diatribe of vulgarity.<br /><br />After this scene is over, the main characters come into play. 5 people: David (Barbie), his girlfriend, his sister, and David's friend and that friend's girlfriend. David's sister pours what looks like cocaine into a well, symbolically promising to get clean off of her drugs. After going in the house, they start a time elapsed renovation scene, that we have no idea how long lasted, I couldn't imagine they finished restoring this house in less than a day, because David's sister goes through withdrawals after the house is already finished, but hey, probably just a writing flaw. Also, no idea where they got the wood or materials needed. After the house is finished, and the former drug addict is locked into her room, the gang stumbles upon the basement. The basement is filled with hanging decomposing cats, satanic relics, and a burnt post. They find a book sized object, wrapped in a trash bag covered in barbed wire. So what happens? A male character whose name escapes me, David's friend, cuts the barbed wire, unwraps the trash bag, and discovers the book of the dead. He starts to read the translations and ends up calling upon the 5 demons on the thrones of hell.<br /><br />This is where things start to get serious. The sister tries to escape, and get's raped by that tree, just like the original, except that a demon girl with super striking reddish orange eyes is watching her as it goes on. Then when she gets back to the cabin, she takes a shower in boiling hot water, and gets third degree burns, which disappear by the end of the movie without being explained. Her brother tries to get her to a hospital, and discovers the road has been flooded over. He brings her back to the cabin, they sedate her, and put her to bed. She eventually wakes up, and comes to the main room with a shotgun the found in the basement, and shoots her brother in the arm. They restrain her in her room, start to remove the shrapnel, and she gets loose again. She goes nuts, throws up a blood like viscous substance all over the African American character, the girlfriend of David's friend. The lock her in the basement cellar, in hopes that she won't be able to escape (which she does.)<br /><br />The newly infected woman goes to the bathroom to rinse herself off. After a few minutes, her boyfriend comes in to check on her, and reveals that she has used the piece of glass to cut off parts of her face. She attacks her boyfriend, stabbing him an incredible amount of times with both an hypodermic needle and the piece of glass. Her boyfriend kills her with the top of a toilet, bashing her head in, resulting in a bathroom floor covered in blood and carnage.<br /><br />The boyfriend survives after being stabbed directly in the heart, and bleeding more blood than is probably in the human body, but that's just the style of the movie, and I love it.<br /><br />And the movie pretty much takes it's course. Davids girlfriend cuts off her hand, it goes and does it's own thing. David's sister splits her tongue with a razor blade, which made my skin crawl, because it just went onfor what seemed like forever.<br /><br />David dies, after saving his sister by burying her, digging her up and using an electronic reviving device he made himself.<br /><br />His sister fights the devil, wins, and vouila, the movie is over.
B00006AUIG|3.0|This is a well-done if slow paced horror film. The abandoned psychological hospital is a real place and is as vivid a character in the movie as any of the actors. Speaking of, David Caruso and the other actors are all excellent. This is a film that builds up a creepy mood.

B007G51UV0|1.0|I purchased to these boards.  One to replace the initial board which continually had freezing problems.  First let me state that I am not an amateur, I've been building systems for over 15 years and an educated and hold a MCSE as well as A+ hardware tech certifications.  I have built over 100 systems in my career.  In my estimation this motherboard has been one of my worst experiences in building systems.  After doing much research and always being a loyal Asus fan, I decided to build a new system for myself based on the new Ivy core processor.  I also read the qualified vendors list from Asus for this board in great detail and updated it to the newest bios release from Asus website.  I successfully got the system to post and loaded Windows 7 64-bit professional.  My boot drive is a crucial SSD 256 GB.  I used G. Skill Z ram as recommended by the QVL.  And what a nightmare I had.  This motherboard continually froze and refuse to boot unless the bios was cleared.  I did not overclocked is board and tried multiple frequencies as recommended by the vendors.  I would be using this board for 10 minutes and the mouse cursor would start changing icons and the system would freeze causing a hard reboot.  At first I thought it might've and USB 3.0 problems and we install the OS and used different ports for the mouse.  Again the same problems developed continual intermittent freezing.  I then ordered different RAM off the QVL list from the manufacture.  After installing the new RAM I still experience continual system freezing.  After another weeks if worth of emails to Asus tech support, I decided to send the board back and get a replacement which I did thanks to Amazon's excellent customer service.<br /><br />Once again I rebuilt the system taking great care to research and ensure everything was perfect.  After the build I reinstalled the OS and guess what I start experiencing the same problems with the second board.  After two days of frustration I noted that on multiple websites other people are experiencing the same problem and Asus had no solution.  Based on my personal experiences and what I consider lack of support from a company that used to be second to none I returned the board and went to a different manufacturer has had no problems since using a competitor's board.  I cannot recommend anyone by this board unless Asus decides to offer better support and update the bios or change the QVL to be accurate.sites other people are experiencing the same problem and Asus had no solution.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think it's a good game that works the mind it's addicting one u play that's no stopping urself I love it
0240815807|4.0|I'm only twenty or thirty pages into this book , but so far, I like it.  He's good about giving the reasons for methods and explains concepts well. If you are new to recording/mixing it will be invaluable, and if you are experienced it will be a great way to fill in those little details which you may find peppering your set-up and workflow, as well as giving you the reasoning behind the way you've done things because you were told to do them that way so many years ago. It's entertaining, informative and well organized.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazingly awesome. My brothers,friends, and family have it. I got the game for the Xbox 360,Computer, and the kindle. I recommend this game to anyone who likes building app. Cheap for the kindle.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We ordered this for our daughter for the up and coming Christmas (2013) Other than that, I can't give any fair review on it. (I really have no clue what it is) lol.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is the best game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I bet whoever gets it will really enjoy this game and i myself liked it a lot.
0385512058|5.0|the book came recommended and rightfully so... great book, great insights that I am sure will help me down the road.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great. Works well on all my devices. I use it for grocery lists, job notes for my construction business, storing photos associated with written notes, etc.<br />Solid and easy to use.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|ok, full disclosure: i haven't really gotten into Sudoku before, but I am now hooked! Great design, option and customisation choices. I am fully enjoying Sudoku with new appreciation and am enjoying the different forms of gameplay available. Thank you 1 gravity llc.<br />The developers have taken the complaints of other reviewers seriously and have removed open feint and flurry from the embedded tracking.
055338466X|3.0|I consider myself to be a well educated and fairly intelligent guy, but I have to admit much of this book went over my head. When Hawkings uses everyday events to explain some of the laws of physics things here are easy to comprehend, but when he uses physics to explain physics it tends to get a little fuzzy.<br /><br />I picked up this book hoping to get a handle on the God vs. Physics debate, and the book does a good job of that. I now have a better understanding of how the universe could have come from nothing, and a god was not necessary for this to happen, however if you've ever seen a total solar eclipse it's hard not to imagine that a supreme being set this up for us to see. So, maybe the book poses more questions than answers, but it will give you a greater understanding of our universe and explain the history of physics through the ages.<br /><br />I'm going to read it again and see if more of this sinks in, but for now the idea of something from nothing still eludes me and it's only a three star book.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|First thing, I will admit I have not purchased this CD, I've just listened to the samples here on Amazon.  Therefore, I will not be ragging on any of the songs.  I can pretty much tell by the samples which songs would be my favorites and I'll leave it at that.  But, as a former classic rock disc jockey, I have to rag on the state of commercial/corporate radio being so terrible that even a new Aerosmith album goes completely ignored by the Medium.  Legendary Child was pushed as a radio single at least a year before \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" was released.  I think a dozen radio station nationwide gave the song a half dozen spins and then dumped it.  Typically when this happens, the record label pushes a power ballad as the next single.  THAT didn't even happen this time.  There are 2-3 songs on here that sound very radio-friendly.  But, radio stations nowadays are like sheep......if the rock stations in Cleveland/Detroit/Atlanta aren't playing it, the rock stations in Las Vegas/Salt Lake/Portland aren't going to play it either.  But to be fair, I think I only heard it once on Sirius/XM as well.  Sadly, this will probably go down as the poorest selling Aerosmith CD ever.  If the mood strikes me, I might pick this CD up someday.  If you like this disc, great......crank it!!  If you don't; well, they probably don't have more than a couple albums left in the tank as the \\"Bad Boys of Beantown\\" are no spring chickens, so enjoy the old stuff. The Stones have even said recently they're probably done making new albums as nobody is buying them (which sadly, is directly linked to the lack of radio play).
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|A good way to spend a relaxing time. Fun movie to watch. Don't miss it. The characters are funny. Can't wait to watch D2.
1557048630|5.0|Beautiful book!  My daughter is a big fan of digital animation and How to Train your Dragon.  It was a perfect gift.
B001THZAAI|5.0|Everyone at home liked this movie.  It is entertaining and funny. I have watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed, great summer read as my flowers garden is blooming beautifully.  I now know the meanings of the flowers I have chosen. Love this book
1781162646|3.0|I enjoyed the story, mainly because I like circus, carnival, and amusement areas as a background. Writing-wise, I think Mr. King's earlier books were better. The Green Mile was, I think, the peak of his writing career. Both the book and movie were wonderful. Like most of the \\"Hollywood bunch\\", he seems to feel the need to ram his liberal political opinions down our throats, and make sure we know that all Republicans (like myself) are evil. Hence, we have, in this story, a shot at Nixon on p.12, Jesus, the flag, and the NRA on p.157, smoking (it makes your hair turn gray at a early age ???) on p.175, and the fact that Republicans like Dick Cheney should not be allowed to get heart transplants on p. 279. As I said in a earlier review, I stopped reading \\"DOME\\" when I got to the part, early in the book, when all the \\"bad cops\\" were Reborn Christians, and the REALLY BAD head cop had a picture in his office of him shaking hands with Sarah Palin. I belong to no religion, but I feel no need to find fault with people who are religious.<br /><br />At the end of the story Mr. King points out that because this book will not, for now, be e-published, folks who want to read it must buy a book. Mr. King, are there no longer Libraries where you live? That's where I got mine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's mostly fun, but sometimes it could be kind of boring...it works fine for a Kindle Fire too! ^^ I think Teenagers and Adults would like this game more than children.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This album is definitely not what it is claims to be; the tracks are all studio demos not worthy of being released as a \\"new Jimi Hendrix album.\\" Not to mention almost all of the tracks featured are just alternate takes of songs that have been released before on other official albums and box sets. That said; a lot of them are (in my opinion) superior to any other versions released before, despite missing Jimi's intended overdubs and the vocals peaking at times due to the fact that they weren't final takes. The versions of 'Earth Blues,' 'Somewhere' and 'Hear My Train a Comin'' featured on this album are among my favourite Hendrix songs ever.<br /><br />In conclusion; these recordings are all great but should have instead been released as part of a compilation album or box set; not a 'studio album'.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very interesting book - There is no &#34;manual&#34; to read when one is elected president so it was nice to read that the former presidents embrace the &#34;new guy&#34; with any help that he or she is willing to accept. I never knew that the much maligned Herbert Hoover was quite a talented and wonderful statesman for the US until I read this book.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Amazon cut off my movie 1/3 the way through and i am now paying  again to re-rent it so i can finish.

B00BR4QNJ0|2.0|The only way to truly enjoy this game is to NOT! I repeat DO NOT! buy Glue Credits. The actual game is only 50 levels long, after that it's just repetition. The game is free, so keep it that way and enjoy.
B00536OCZA|5.0|What has been said about this record says it all. A masterpiece of the twentieth century. There is no other way, except to say there will never be another one like this. Super clean, very innovated piece of work. All hail PINK FLOYD!!!

I found (so it seemed) a reputable seller and when I received it doesn't work on any devices of mine, my daughters or my mom/dad devices...it's NOT compatible. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game. It's so addicting. 5 stars. I can't put it down. By far my new favorite game.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a road trip from page one. All geeks, nerds, gamers, and movie buffs will appreciate the encyclopedic knowledge of the author. If you remember the earliest gaming consoles and computing systems, you'll get a kick out of this sweet, kick-ass coming of age story set in a not-too-distant and uncertain future.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great. It gives good diversity. It lets you be in charge of your own reflexes. Also it has enough changes in content without being overwhelming. The only thing not so good is without buying coins it is pretty hard to gain enough to really do anything . All in all I think that this game scores pretty high in my opinion. Thank you.
B000FZERIG|4.0|\\"Living in th Material World\\" was George Harrison's follow-up album to his great \\"All Things Must Pass\\". Harrison is to some extent associated with fairly introvert and often not so easily accessible music and this image may fit pretty well to this album. Two numbers stand out by being both uplifting and melodically catchy. \\"Give Me Love\\" was a well-deserved big single hit of 1973, which the album as a whole also was. \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" is just as catchy and was also planned as a sequel to \\"Give Me Love\\", but the release never took place; incomprehensible.<br /><br />Otherwise, the album is mostly characterized by ballads with thoughtful and often religious themes. The strongest among these are \\"The Light that Lighted the World\\" and the musically very complex \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\".<br /><br />Two tracks, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" and \\"The Lord Loves the One\\", also stand out with  and having distinct Beatles characteristics.<br /><br />The two bonus tracks are B-sides from the period, especially the \\"Deep Blue\\" is a fine addition to the album, while \\"Miss O'Dell\\" shows Harrison from a relaxed and unpretentious side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 4 year old love this game I have to take the kindle away from her to get her to stop playing it very good game for kids to play and for me to get a lil peace during the day lol
B005L193RO|5.0|Good piece of writing, some plain common sense advise, some intuitive but also some new revealing facts. Supported by recent scientific studies and put forward in a very clear and easy style. I strongly recommend it to anybody who introspects and values self-improvement.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little sister absolutely loves this game and it teaches her to treat things nicely, one problem to me is it has a slow pace to me
1439102813|3.0|This book was recommended by someone in an Alz Assoc Forum I attended. I expected to relate more to the story since my significant other has Alz. He is 68 and I have been with him for 7 yrs. I have lived with his gradual deterioration every day for probably the past 4 years. I think my story is far more interesting than that in the book with regards to exploring what might be going on to cause his behavior, changes in our relationship and family dynamics.<br />I think this is a good book for someone who wants to dip their toe into this world and get a feel for what happens to one individual. It is a quick read. Unfortunately, I already know far more about Alz than I ever imagined.  I hoped I would gain new insight from the perspective of the patient but I didn't.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third book i have read by this author and have enjoyed all of his writing and was intrigued by this last one.  The stories are all connected in a way that is totally believable mysterous way
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's not to hard, nor to easy. Really looking forward to more levels. Only took about a hour to beat.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and can't wait for the next season! It is thrilling and suspenseful and the actors are phenomenal. I would recommend this to everyone.
1878424319|5.0|Great resource to learn about ourselves and improve our life. The only thing required is to have an open mind and take the information presented in this book and apply it to our life. This book has helped me change relationships in my life and improved my quality of life by being much happier.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This is a great game. I would love to experience this kind of fun in real life. Lol. But where (I know in the county) do people do this? Mississippi,Louisiana,Alabama? Where?. But overall a great &amp; entertaining game.
B008858OFM|4.0|I rented this movie before I bought it...but I love Julia Roberts...I tried reading the book & I couldn't get past the Italy part, but the movie was just somewhat inspiring, even if you can't take a whole year off to go exploring!  :)
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I already had the dvd versions of all the movies, but since they were all classics, I had to have the blu-ray version. The picture and sound quality were great!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This device has made downloading and sharing my pictures very simple and easy. Now I don't have to wait  for my slow computer to process my photos when I simply use this kit to download and share my photos on my iPad. I just love!
1623420148|5.0|This story was completely and totally awesome! Drew & Kate! Well! HAWWT and HYSTERICAL!! I made the mistake or reading this book while eating out...BIG MISTAKE! I was laughing so hard everyone wanted to know what I was reading! Great chemistry, the characters are hysterical and I love how Drew describes everything in the male perspective. Kate is no slouch, she is strong and sexy - perfect for Drew. I really hope Mz. Case has another book coming out soon! This is so good, I have read it TWICE!
0425263924|5.0|I have not read it yet but very excited to read it. Came to me in perfect condition and packaging!!!
B0058SNI5S|5.0|I can wear these to work.  they are very light I have to make sure I walk correctly, you can't feel them on and they have made me stumble a few times and I fell once.  I just have to be conscious to lift my feet when I walk in them.
0345803485|5.0|Book was great. Just couldn't put it down and co-workers wanted to read them as soon as I finished reading them!
0553386794|2.0|I tried really hard to like this book after enjoying the HBO series so much. It's hard to get past the awkward phrasing, the misspellings, poor grammar, and the endless strings of simplistic sentences and unrealistic dialogues.  There are sections where the writing is wonderful, but then it reverts back to fifth-grade level.  If it weren't for the sexual content and strong language, I would expect to find this book in the juvenile fiction section of the library.  The screenwriters for the HBO series did a much better job spinning this tale.  The poor writing quality really ruins the storyline.
0345803493|5.0|Book was great. Just couldn't put it down and co-workers wanted to read them as soon as I finished reading them!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had lots to do this week, but kept finding myself reading this book. A great read! Can't wait to start the next Will Robie
0425263908|5.0|I have not read it yet but very excited to read it. Came to me in perfect condition and packaging!!!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The plot line of this novel is rich in depth, scope, as well as history and science as is typical of Rollins. My favorite part was the character development of those who have played supporting roles until now. Siechan has always piqued my interest and it is nice to see her get her due in the past 2 books. Vigor and Rachel as well.
0345803507|5.0|Book was great. Just couldn't put it down and co-workers wanted to read them as soon as I finished reading them!

B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This movie is a Scorcese masterpiece.........great soundtrack with Nillson, George Harrison, Derek and the Dominoes, Donovan, etc. and a mesmerizing account of mob life fleshed out by memorable performances from Joe Pesci (Do I amuse you), De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, and Ray Rilotta. Plus you'll see a fair amount of actors who later were regulars on the Sopranos.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|I'm a Kanye West fan also but i'm not going to give this garbage a pass. I can be the biggest fan to an artist, a crappy album is a crappy album. Everything on this is disposable. There were songs I even skipped cause they were annoying. And black slaves is only good for the first half then the singing parts is terrible. Maybe it will grow on me. If it does grow on me then ill make another review but I doubt it will. I will also add his last album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy was good but i felt that one was a bit overrated also...
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great ap because so much is automatic - just takes a finger. I play it when I cannot sleep to relax.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A slow start, the book grew into a twisted and disturbing marriage gone wrong. I was hoping for a different ending, but an overall satisfying, suspenseful read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not as good as the other 2 books. Hopefully the 4th book will come out a lot sooner than the 3rd book did. Had to re-read the first 2 again because book 3 was too long in coming.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King returns to form as the best descriptive and engaging writer in America. I was drawn in and could not put this book down. Surely his best work since The Stand.  I read this book over 18 months ago and can still see in my mind passages and characters that were easy to imagine with Kings adept and descriptive guidance. Yes, you should buy this book and read it. Not a horror story and not a ghost story, but a great fantasy, history, and love story with his trademarked tension and humor.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and is much more in depth than you would think. Especially for a free game! I highly recommend it.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|Clarke has some of the best original ideas in modern writing. Clarke is also very dry and stingy when it comes to character developement.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Had never seen this show but my hubby thought I would like it.  He was right.  We have been watching it every night together.  Not dirty, no sexual innuendos, just a great storyline and likable characters.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|Lots of scenery that is unneccessary, but a GREAT plot and excellent SPX! Kudos to Norway for putting out a movie that is better than 95% of American low budget monster movies. Language barrier is bothersome and distracting, but I guess they actually speak Norwiegan in Norway!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is fun and easy to play.  Keeps track of statistics so you can see how many games you win and high score.  Great visuals that you can customize.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I seem to be wasting my time when I recommend this movie to people. As soon as I say &#34;Warrior&#34;, they roll their eyes and imagine a cheap sword-and-sorcery movie. Don't be like them!  This is a great movie and has a wonderful cast! Don't think about it, just buy it and watch it.  A great against all odds plot, fantastic acting, and well paced storyline and human drama. You will be cheering at the end!

B0053YGYO4|4.0|There are some great songs on here (Paradise and Princess of China) but there are a couple that are a little dead (Up in Flames, Up with the Birds) so its a mixed bag.  Still, pleasant enough for a long drive...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|My son loves it.  It freezes occasionally,  but not often.  Game is fun. (I have parental controls on so his only complaint is that he can't buy upgrades.)

B000ESST6U|5.0|The Met's production of the past season was wonderful featuring Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra, giving a comical touch to the whole piece. Glyndebourne's on this DVD is different and far superior in many ways. Sarah Connolly's voice is divine and her performance of masculinity is uncanny. Christophe Dumaux as Ptolemy, superb in singing and acting, makes you imagine how Molière would have been performed during the 17th century. The encounter of Cesare and Ptolemy in Act I wonderfully recreates what would have been the style of acting, singing, and staging at the time. Part of the success of the Met's production comes from the fact that it modeled itself after this Glyndebourne production--even using some of the best singers (in the roles of Ptolemy, Cornelia, and Nirenus) and the same set designer (in fact, mostly the same design) and the same costume designer (although costume is based on different ideas in the Met's version). In both productions , the stylized staging--including dances and acrobatics--is something worth seeing.  This DVD version is designed in such a way that the entirety of the scene as well as details can be enjoyed. Review by Sumie Jones
B003B02O7I|4.0|This book, like all of Grisham's novels catches the reader's attention immediately,  Good story line, fast read.  Would definitely, recommend this as a casual read.
B008CP93S0|5.0|I love Jen A and Paul Rudd and this movie was great. I'm so sick of the same 'ol crap movies are made of.  This was a good flick for both actors.  Funny and kept me happy.  I would even watch it again and I don't usually watch movies over again.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|If you love some dungeon crawling and demon killing you will not be disappointed. It's a little slow building your character if you don't buy gems, but you get plenty of action for free if you just want to kill some time.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the challenge this game gives with every deal. It is very user<br /> friendly and kids all ages can play.

0545265355|5.0|This is not just popular fiction. It seems to be reminding us that each step along our way as a society, we can either make or break ourselves.  If I were teaching an honors English class on the 11th or 12th grade level, I would put this into a unit with Margaret Atwood's &#34;The Handmaid's Tale&#34;, Aldous Huxley's &#34;Brave New World&#34; and George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34;, in reverse order. These fascinating, cautionary dystopian novels seem to point out our greatest faults and fears as humanity and inhumanity. Characters are well developed and each volume is readable. A student actually challenged me to read it after I shared another author with him. I enjoyed each volume. I certainly hope that Suzanne Collins comes up with another series. I enjoy her style immensely.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|This s one of our favorite games at our house. We had it as Hydrothunder on Nintendo 64 and PS2. We spent hours playing it. The app is done very well. It is easy to drive the boats and use the controls. The graphics are wonderful!
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|This is well edited. Apart from bringing back fond memories of the British Invasion in music, seeing The Beatles as we first saw them is pure fun.

0307476073|1.0|Here I was sitting on my bed on a Saturday, a very rare occasion when I take time for myself. I was about halfway through the book and couldn't put it down. However, I just came to a point in the book that will haunt me forever -- it's when Cheryl (the author) and her brother tried to \\"put down\\" her mother's old horse, Lady, with a rifle instead of having it done humanely by a veterinarian by injection. Sadly, the horse had been neglected after their mother died. That was the first sordid, sad detail I didn't expect to read about. But it got much worse. Cheryl and her brother thought they could shoot the horse with one bullet between her eyes, and that's what they set out to do. However, that didn't work, and Cheryl's brother had to shoot Lady again and again while she bled and moaned and faltered. The horse still wasn't dead, and the gun had no more bullets. It was so barbaric and cruel that I couldn't even get through the rest of the text to see how the poor horse finally died. I shut the book closed and threw it in the trash. How anyone could do this -- someone who's gone to college -- to an innocent animal for any reason is beyond me. Ignorance and lack of money are never excuses for animal cruelty. Cheryl's mother would've been horrified. What a grave injustice to her horse, who, neglected and old, still was full of majesty and grace. That ruined the entire book for me. In honor of Lady, RIP.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Got this game out of curiosity and it took me awhile to get the hang of it. But now I can't stop playing. Great for mystery lovers and puzzle solvers.
B00BQ83TMG|4.0|I really liked this series.  I got a little weary of all the blood and guts, but the story line carried it through. Utred continues to be one of my favorite heroes. Cornwell weaves a wonderful yarn, (if can pardon my pun on the &#34;three spinners&#34; of the fates).  It has been a terrific read for both my husband and me, but I am glad to take a breath as we wait for the final episode.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My seven year old grandson loves Minecraft.  These Lagos were his birthday gift.  They were a big hit and he continues to build Mine craft worlds.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written, finely crafted, excellence in fiction... what I really want to say is this: I was born in Dallas and have lived within Texas all my life, but I feel as if I have come home whenever I read one of Hosseini's books. Thank you.
0316066524|5.0|This is the only book I've ever read that actually made me laugh aloud. I could care less about tennis, and yet, I never once felt disinterested about the lives of everyone involved in Enfield Tennis Academy, from drills and analysis to the rampant drug and clean urine-based student economy. This is an astoundingly complex, lengthy tapestry of the interweaving lives of around 100 different characters across many years and great distance, yet even with all that the story is easy to follow thanks to the late author's brilliant storytelling style in which seemingly disconnected narratives fall into place around the two most central characters' own in just the right way to be most impactful (or at hilarious). That said, this is not a book that doesn't require a great deal of effort to read, but it is far more rewarding than difficult, where even the most mundane and uninteresting events are cast in such a light that they fascinate and draw you in, all framed by the darkly comic and 'absurdist' style D.F.W. was known for. It really does live up to the hype, even if the 'cool factor' of this book is pushed the hardest by people whose heads it sails over.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|It just wasn't as good as I hoped, and I wasn't that optimistic...<br /><br />Story Line bla bla bla<br /><br />Actors - No body stands out.<br /><br />Glad I didn't pay $25 at the theater to see this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love escape from these rooms.  It is very enjoyable plus it never hurts to tax the mind, does it???  I am anxiously awaiting more rooms to escape from!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book did a great job of mixing adventure, cyberpunk, and romance. I read the book in 3 days mostly when I should have been sleeping. I really liked the main character and think everyone could relate to his sense of isolation and longing for meaningful contact. I highly recommend.
0425263924|5.0|Great book!  Enjoyed this series and excited to know there will be a book #4. Just wish it wouldn't take or eve to come out!
B009AMAM9S|3.0|Cloud Atlas was too long and would have been better as several shorter movies, it kept jumping between story lines, the subtitles were hard to read (worthless), odd made-up languages used and it seemed like a show off movie for the actors rather than a story with any meaning for the viewers.<br /><br />What we liked was at the end where the stories kinda came together and the message of being true to yourself came out. It was very well done visually but we feel it would have worked better had they finished one segment then went on to the next one rather than jumping back and forth.<br /><br />I frankly lost interest though it did seem to get better as it went along; my partner enjoyed it more and teared up during some scenes. The visuals were one of the high points of the movie however there was too much violence and some of it cheap shots. It seems like action took the place of thinking for the writer of the story.<br />Michelle Ress<br />June 2013
0061992860|5.0|This is the version you will put in your bug out bag or glove compartment. Very well written and detailed. I was expecting a average size book but when it gets delivered to your door it is only about four inches by three inches and one inch thick. Crazy little book that could save your life if you ever need it.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I've always been a fan of Paul Anka's and I totally enjoyed these duets! The selection of songs were wonderful!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is a work horse and you will never worry about breaking it. Nice even weight and very strong. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good all around knife.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games inspired me about that life is not just fun and games that there are bad people out there.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Love this DVD and would recommend it to anyone, young or old.  It is amazing in it's versitility in ability to entertain on many levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game.I don't have any problem with it.the only thing is when I downloaded it.there wasn't much time to finish the Miami level it started off in the middle of it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I don't usually like bubble games but this one is actually pretty cool. Love the theme and the background music is neat.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I'd like to change background colors. Can't.  This app has essentially no option but the blue background and some puzzles with dark colors are hard to see clearly.
B0056FMNYA|4.0|Good product but little overpriced.<br />Pros:<br />- Its sturdy and quite functional<br />- Good quality built<br />- Feels<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Overpriced<br />- Base place might get unstable after some rigorous usage
B0059WTMLW|4.0|When it has came down to puzzle games, none of them have seemed more popular in the past decade than Sudoku. It really has became more than a trend, it really has tested the mind, spirit and ranks high in video games with the greatest puzzle games like Bejeweled, and Tetris. Now, it is available with your smartphone and android device with Sudoku 4ever Plus. It definitely continues the excitement from Sudoku games before. It definitely is a very addictive game that is worth playing each and every time. It really keeps your mind sharp, and your youth strong. What I do wish though is that they made a option in the game for beginners to have a easier time with the harder puzzles. But nevertheless, it is definitely worth its money.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Control: B+<br /><br />Sound: B-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|This was a real help when my brother was diagnosed with ALS (aka Lou Gerig's Disease).  He lost his ability to talk.  This was a very helpful aid in helping us communicate on a face-to-face level.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I usually like G5 Hidden object games but the free one is so short that if you are on a roll then you have to buy it. It cost tho much for the full version.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I got a Kindle keyboard for Christmas two years ago. I loved it so much that I bought one for my mother and sister so we could all read the same books. I now have Kindle on a smart phone and a table as well. I will read books on all the devices, but my favorite is the Kindle keyboard. (Finally, I found an electronic device that did not become obsolete in 18 months! Thanks, Amazon.)
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Love it!!!! Ella is awesome! I had 'Royals' stuck in my head for a week straight! I can't wait to hear more from her!
0061950726|3.0|Orphan trains went regularly from the East Coast to Midwest farmlands between 1854 and 1929. Children were adopted by families to work on the farm in exchange for food, shelter, and education. As this book reveals, their experience was often very sad and oppressive.<br /><br />The story toggles between modern-day Maine and Depression era Minnesota. Vivian Daly, an orphan replanted in the West, is now an old woman going through her mementos in Maine with the help of Molly, a seventeen-year-old Penobscot Indian, who is serving community service. The women find a common bond in their foster homes.<br /><br />I felt too much of this very short book was spent on the present day. The interesting story (that of the orphans) was hastily sketched out. The POV is of a ten-year-old being transferred from one foster home to another. The language used for her was more like that of an adult. I would say the book was appropriate for young adults, but not with a rape scene and the language. I was left wanting more of the stories of the orphans.<br /><br />Harper Collins graciously supplied the ARC for my unbiased opinion.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|PRETTY addictive game.  LOTS of levels and its actually a challenging game to play. I'm sure you'll like it too.
0307476073|4.0|For a long time I was thinking the title of this book was Strayed and couldn't believe it was her last name it was so perfect.  Then she explained. This book was skillfully constructed to keep us in suspense. Hiking -- while giving us the back story of her life. I was with her all the way. Her boots, so well portrayed, and her backpack \\"Monster\\" became characters in the book.  And her feet.  I cared more about her feet than Cheryl herself. But I couldn't believe she found so many \\"handsome\\" men on the trail though.  And in the end, I felt a real let down when she completed her journey, as surely she did as well.  Other reviewers talk about redemption, but though it was implied, I didn't see it.  I wanted to see if and how she overcame her various temptations and addictions when she returned to normal life.  I don't believe the trek could have cured her.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Why are there not more games like this ?!? Absolutely can't wait for the next edition-hurry up and get it done!! LOVED it!!!:o<br /><br />Kathclair<br /><br />WOW!!!!!
B001DF68MA|5.0|Sits well, easy to ride, my son is 11 months and he is comfortable and enjoys it! Keeps you balanced, so glad we went with this product
B0015DROBO|5.0|I first read this trilogy many years ago, and was delighted with the intricacies of the personalities involved.  The major mystery which is uncovered, and the way in which it is solved is a real treasure.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the change of scenery and the challenges. It's very addictive. It's not like temple run where you get bored by not being challenged.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The new tower is sooo cool the upgrades are so neat the game is less expensive then btd4 btd4 is 1 cent more
B00CMEQD30|4.0|I don't often read fantasy and wasn't sure if I would like this or not. I did! It is a great story about a Queen and her bodyguard, searching for a way to lift a terrible curse from their kingdom. The story is fast-moving and kept me enthralled, always eager to see what would happen next. The women encountered many obstacles along the way and had to fight an evil sorceress, but in the end, love of course prevailed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like these kinds of games and this one is a winner. Even my thirteen year old daughter had to help me with one or two! Lol!  Hope to get many more stages soon.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|That's a good game, ,to play with my son's I love it!!! I recommend it, personally I enjoy it, Iove it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It can be a little hard....but you will figure it out. Best I played in awhile. Can't wait for more levels. Highly recommend.
B003R50AW8|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was different to anything else I have read. A great story and an unexpected ending.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|I have seen the movie 4 times and each time, I find something different to laugh out loud about. Cohen and his co-stars accents are right on the money and the stupidity of the character he portrays screams for a sequel. Some may say this film is offensive but if you understand a true comic in a farcical role, buy it today!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great easy read. Storyline was awesome and easy to follow. Will continue to read the other books in this series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a pretty fun and easy and hard and creative game that I like to play with the kids
0785153942|1.0|Few time in my life have I read a comic and become increasingly more angry with each flip of the page... If you walked into a store, had never see or heard of Pacific Rim, picked up this book and could flipped through it, you'd probably put it back, I know I would have, even knowing about Pacific Rim.<br /><br />The book is a quick read, probably because there is nothing visually engaging about page after page of \\"talking heads\\" and relatively no action. Seriously, there's maybe, 13 pages of action in the whole book total. GIANT MONSTER vs ROBOTS and they couldn't come up with something more interesting then people talking to a reporter for 99% of the book.<br /><br />No, the artwork is not \\"Amazing\\" or \\"Fantastic\\" as some reviewers have stated, rather just the opposite. If anything it's criminally mediocre and you should ask yourselves, why is there no \\"Look Inside\\" option if it's so great. It comes shrink wrapped for a reason, and it ain't the nudity because there is smoke covering things up.<br /><br />Maybe they should have found at least one artist who ether likes or is capable of drawing robots or monsters and making it exciting on those 13 pages they bothered to devote to something other then talking heads. How can something like this come out that conveys almost nothing from the world visually that the trailers have. I'm talking about things like Mood, creativity, excitement, energy. The artwork has none of that... it honestly just feels like some guys collecting a pay check at the readers expense.<br /><br />How can a movie that looks so incredible have a companion graphic novel that is so not!
B0080SW3CC|5.0|I was very happy with the ordering speed... The book got here days before it was due.. I have to read this book for a school project so  I was glad to know I would have plenty of time to read it :)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great graphics, challenging in all the best possible ways. Glad that I got the game and have played many hours on it
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is an informative and compassionate journey with someone with early onset Alzheimer's. I have gone on that journey recently with a very good friend who is in the middle stages.  It gave me more information about what she is going through.  A must read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't get enough. Read this book in a day. It was that good! Definitely recommend this book. Amazing!  Now I'm looking for my Christian!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Chess Free is absolutely great!  This fine application is challenging, complete with a mind-bendingly fast response time and counter-moves well calculated to the player's level of experience and patience.  The game offers just enough control without complications.  Simple, adaptive, fun.  A perfect tool for beginners and experts alike.  Highly recommended!
B000021Y7X|5.0|This concert is great and very rewatchable. The versions of &#34;Slippery People&#34; and &#34;Girlfriend is Better&#34; sound better than their studio ones. The visuals for &#34;What a Day that Was&#34; and &#34;Girlfriend is Better&#34; are also memorable. The one weak point is &#34;The Genius of Love,&#34; whose live version pales in comparison to the original.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|Yesterday, all of the best 1, 2 and 3 star reviews suddenly got tons of unhelpful votes and now they are all the last ones you'll see in each group. And also yesterday, certain 5 star reviews suddenly got a spike in helpful votes, and now those are the ones you'll see on the main page of this book.  As of right now, there's five 5 star reviews that all have exactly 32 helpful votes each.<br /><br />And then today, the price of the book dropped.  It's as though someone anticipated that there'd be more interest in this book because of this planned price drop, and they didn't want those potential buyers to easily see any of the most helpful critical reviews. I wonder who would do that?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! From the very beginning, I was pulled into the story and the characters.  The writing was so vivid & real, I felt like I was watching a movie.
0345803485|1.0|After a couple of pages I thought I had the wrong book in my hands and was reading something written for teenage girls or single ladies in their sixties...... although that remained the overall impression, I later in the book discovered it has some sexual content ! Wow, that must be why there is so much hype about this book, but again: disappointment because the sex is like out-of-date, seen everything before in the seventies - nothing special, new or remarkable ......<br /><br />This book, as well as the number 2, is a disaster - reading it is a waste of time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game. It challenges you in every room and doesn't repeat the same clues over and over. fun and entertaining.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|right at the top of the list of the best of horror films. good stunts that make the skin crawl.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this is a terrible game! I would eat slimy sardines before<br />downloading this preposterous thing they call a game.<br />don't waste your time I guarantee you will delete in the first hour.
1475212607|4.0|I decided a few weeks ago to finally pursue my dream of writing for a living, and this was one among eight books I purchased on writing, editing and publishing. I finished it within three days of receiving it.<br /><br />The overall message I got from the book is that I should get my butt in gear and actually WRITE one of my novel ideas, because the digital self-publishing scene is thriving NOW. It's motivated me to write a ton of notes and settle on which book I'm going to write first, because I want on that train. It sounds too simple, easy, and profitable; I have to at least try!<br /><br />Other books I've read tell you to keep trying, keep submitting, and cope with endless rejection for years until perseverance and astronomical luck finally net you an agent or a publishing deal. This book says, &#34;Hey, why don't you just skip all that nonsense, get your books out there, and let readers decide if they want to buy it or not?&#34;<br /><br />It's full of practical advice and a rundown of the current state of both traditional and digital publishing. I appreciated the data on how much profit an author will actually take home per book with traditional publishing versus digital publishing. There's some good insight in there. There are also resources and links in the back. Also, thanks to the self-published authors' success stories, I've found some new books to read.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because there are some places where the author repeats himself and it could use a wee bit more editing. It's not PERFECT. But I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about self-publishing -- or even not thinking about it! I didn't plan to self-publish until I read this book and learned how simple it was. There really is no excuse to not give it a shot. And this book can give you a head start on doing it.
1250027624|5.0|This book really has great pictures of our favorite characters. Each character is followed for a bit and reveals just enough details to make you long for the new season to begin.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. On to the next one! Hope it's as exciting watching the story unfold. Really good read.
B003OUXECE|3.0|Very well written, if your a fan of the video game your going to enjoy this book. I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|It's gotten too strange. Of course Deb is confused but she is too wishy-washy about what she should do. And she was an idiot to end the season the way she did! OMG! What was she thinking???
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game so far. It's fun. Simple, but nice and challenging. Looking forward to more floors :) I like this way better than the 100 Doors game!
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I get this for my Iphone 4s.<br />fits perfect.<br />not big. and I like the hole in the back, where u can see the apple logo.<br />I have my phone protected, with out the big case.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is the bridge between experimental Radiohead and structured Radiohead. Basically, turn to this album if you want more ambient and electronic music mixed with rock instrumentation.<br />The songwriting is wonderful, every melody keeps you on your toes, the rhythm section is wicked awesome. It has the mysterious intrigue of Kid A and Amnesiac, as well as the immediacy and action of The Bends.<br /><br />In short, this is basically Radiohead doing a big 56 minute experimental/rock jam session.<br /><br />If you're wondering if you should buy this album or not, here's what I'm going to say:<br /><br />- If you're a Radiohead fan then OF COURSE! YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS ALBUM ALREADY!<br />- If you are new to Radiohead, then you're in luck. This is a wonderful album to start with, as it incorporates both the experimental side AND rock side of the band.<br />- If you don't like Radiohead then WHY ARE YOU HERE?<br /><br />I hope my review helped. Let me know if I forgot to touch on anything by commenting on this review.<br /><br />In conclusion, Hail To The Thief is just plain good music, intriguing, adventurous and attractive.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I think this game should be free because I do not think it is worth $5 or at least makke it a little cheaper
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Our family had fun solving all of the levels.  We look forward to the updates and we hope they come soon.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was really good I loved how it was like his real diary/journal I loved how it showed a story about his life and his friends
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Such a great band and such great album. Bankrupt ( the song) is my favorite! Very conceptual. Phoenix never ever ever disappoints!
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|WTF?  It was one of the worst movies we've ever seen.  We couldn't even finish it.  Nothing made sense.  Seemed like it was arranged haphazardly.  JL is not that great.  Her popularity seems to be just mass hysteria.  If unattractive people were in this movie, it would not have received any awards or gotten any attention.  Oh, how charming it is to see the A-list actors pretend to be crazy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I let my daughter get this game and she gets inspired with building legos she I will say what are you building she says houses I say where did you get that from she says  minecraft.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great game! Not super hard to figure your way out of a room. If your looking for a big challenge - don't get this game
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I like to play this game it's fun to play when I have free time I also like to play with other's
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|this game is fun, but dont use real money on it. I had to delete it because it would not let me open it again.
B000002LTU|4.0|This CD was awesome.  This was a very good CD which Miles produced prior to his death and will always be a collectors item.
B00BPA2PGG|4.0|This is one of those films about being trapped behind enemy lines except space aliens are the enemy and anywhere on our planet is the enemy lines.  Kind of like Black Hawk Down but without the emotion.  The acting is decent and you have to hand it to Michelle Rodriguez, she kind of is fun to watch in anything that she does.  Not only that, she is nice to look at even though she's no bathing beauty.  She's more like that girl who is just naturally nice to watch.  The special effects in this are very good and the 4K definition is going to really look beautiful on the new 4K systems.  It looked gorgeous on my 1080p system.  If you get the chance to by &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; in the 4K edition, you will not believe your eyes, even if you are watching it on a 1080p.  Seems the colors are just so much better and you get more picture with it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|After book number 2, I had to wait for book number 3. Thankfully I knew when it was coming out, so that I only started this whole series shortly before book three was released.<br />And now, this book is done....and I want to read more.<br />In total, I found this series a very easy read, and I cannot wait to find out what will happen to Gideon and Eva.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am retired, so l Don't use the app for work, but I wish I had it when I did work.  It is friendly, uncomplicated, and very versatile.  I use the app for my church activities, my reading lists, and my journal.  I also keep notes,clippings, and videos.  I am very happy with the app.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Finishing the first book, I immediately started with the 2nd book, and didn't want to put it down. One gets so absorbed into their story, that I just wanted to carry on and on.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Bradley Cooper would have won the Oscar for his performance in this movie if Daniel Day Lewis hadn't portrayed Lincoln the same year!
B00866H7SS|5.0|After reading 50 Shades, i was recommended to also try this series. In the end, I enjoyed this one more.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|THIS IS A BOOK Club book. I would not have chosen it as the topic of slavery is not one to continually research. The book is well written and a real \\"page turner.\\"  The characters pull the reader in until you simply have to know what happens.
0399159347|5.0|I first discovered Liane Moriarty when my neighborhood book club chose \\"What Alice Forgot\\" one month. I found that book to be absorbing and compelling, and it made all of us ask during our discussion, \\"What would we do in the same situation as Alice?\\"<br /><br />Liane's latest book, \\"The Husband's Secret,\\" will make you ask the same question of yourself, many times over...and not just about one woman's situation, but three. When we meet our three protagonists, they're each experiencing completely unexpected life-altering events. Cecelia discovers a letter her husband John-Paul wrote to her, only to be opened after his death. While he laughs it off as a drunken, sappy letter he wrote following the birth of their first child, his suspicious behavior compels her to open it, and it opens a Pandora's box she never could have imagined. Tess gets the shocking news from her husband, Will, that he's fallen in love with another woman, but it's not just any woman, it's someone very dear to her. And Rachel, who is still devastated over her daughter's death twenty-eight years ago, learns her son and his family (including her beloved 2-year-old grandson) are about to move halfway around the world.<br /><br />That's pretty much all I can say about the plot without giving away Moriarty's delicious secrets, of which there are many. She teases the reader with hints but continually diverts our attention to keep us from guessing what's going to happen next. I became so absorbed in the stories that I read the book in two sittings in about seven hours total. Normally, I might try to guess the secrets, but with this book, I wanted to discover it as Moriarty intended for us to. I figured out the two big secrets in the pages just before they were revealed, but she still kept a few plot twists hidden for the end, which wrapped up with an epilogue that truly reminds us to not wonder \\"what if\\" and just face life as it comes. If you're the type of reader who always wants to guess the plot points in a novel, do yourself a favor and don't this time. Just go with it and focus on the characters' emotions and how they're coping with these incredible life challenges. You will get so much more out of reading this book, I promise you! The first secret isn't fully divulged until halfway into the book, which is maddening, but it does keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />Moriarty's writing feels effortless. She excels at creating compelling, relatable and sympathetic characters, even the \\"bad guys\\" (the two husbands in this story) who, like most bad guys, aren't all bad. While their wives struggle to face their new knowledge of their husbands' glaring imperfections, the reader can't help but wonder if we'd be able to see past them too. She fully lets us inside their heads and hearts, making it possible for us to feel their pain or excitement along with them. I truly found myself wondering what I'd do, how I'd feel, in the situations she created for her characters.<br /><br />This book isn't mindless chick lit by any stretch of the imagination. It will get you thinking, and feeling, in a way that chick lit can't. It's too smart for that. I wholeheartedly recommend \\"The Husband's Secret,\\" whether you're already a fan of Liane Moriarty or you just like a good foray into personal relationships, personal discovery, and the perpetual question we women all seem to ask ourselves, \\"What if...?\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good I love that they have a new place every thirty days or so and with every new place there's a new person I also loved the new keys so that you can save your character this game rocks!!!!! =D :D $D :{D
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|Good app.<br /> - Bad text display in landscape and portrait. The aforementioned sentence is NOT fully displayed, and is clipped/overruns the sides! This is unforgivable.<br /> - Imperfect resumption (sometimes it shows the wrong 'page' while 'reading' another)<br /> - Odd automatic pagination (every sentence, detected/separated by a period, shows up as a new page) which is otherwise a great idea!<br /> - Inconvenient switching between voices and general lack of menu polish<br /><br />This has become my Go-To quickly-listen-to-a-PDF-in-the-car app, replacing EZPDF. Which is powerful but clunky in the car.
B007N85POS|5.0|This app is perfect! No flaws whatsoever :) and it's wayyyy addicting. I absolutely love it :) and it's free which is always a plus. Lol
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game. I am so glad it's lava on my kindle fire hd. Now I can play this game when ever I want to.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|i love the game but the newest update changed how we won prizes after races. if your trying get specific prizes (such as pieces to a puzzle) we don't have much of a chance to get them. please change it back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so addicting! its fun and challenging! I recommend it to everyone who loves a real thinking game :) I did need help on a few levels but its truly a fun game. a good game to also pass time!
1936719010|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. The author essentially rewrote the War of Art and repackaged it in this book, without providing much else in the way of content. I'd hoped for less of a ra ra ra coaching approach to doing the work and more insight into the actual doing. This book is a quick read, but I'd recommend skipping it and just reading the War of Art. You'll get everything you need from that book, while this one is just a water down version of the original.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book freaked me out. Lots of twists and turns. Great holiday read if you'd like to keep your mind engaged a bit.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I don't like shoot em up movies, but this one is so funny and smart. I enjoyed it very much!
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|If anyone is a huge Backstreet Boys fan, this is the album for you. It's the greatest hits album and the songs are amazing.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|This is not only a magnificent release, it is the best of Reed's career, better than even Metal Machine Music.  Metallica were fortunate to be given the opportunity to record with Lou. Someday LULU will be acknowledged as a  masterpiece, due to the invasive lyrics.  And Metallica has lent adequate support, however I think they may have been a little out of their league --- nevertheless,because Metallica is challenged--- the metal band ends up pushing themselves to the absolute limits of their abilities, and thus finally redeems themselves as Artists.  The record sounds  spontaneous, powerful--- creatively decrepit while childlike in its invective debris, for Lou's voice is resilient, psychologically informative, ageless.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I lost my park and I was on level 35 I hate this game.  Good game but it is stupid.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The book started off fantastic being decided into cheaters that were alternately the husband and then the wife's point of view.  Then something awful happened after after the big plot twist whereas the story was taken in a direction where the plot was made Implausible and therefore became a real dud in my mind.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max has done an outstanding job with World War Z.  It is easy to read, just wish there was more information on what infected patient zero.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I would never have taken on such a physical journey.  However, I feel like I have taken a similar journey emotionally.  I think that is where I really felt connected .<br />Her prose is clear concise and thoughtful without being well, silly.  I would recommend it highly.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Game is quite nice, starts off easy and gets challenging quite quickly. Fun to play & I regularly find my self spending a lot of time trying to get 3 stars on every stage. Galaxy S4 (I9500).
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from Tom Cruise. I just thought it looked like a good story and I was in the mood for a thriller! I think this may be best movie Tom Cruise has ever done. He seemed funny, witty and real in this action thriller with great story and great characters. I would give this 4.5 stars :)
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Very nice graphics, sound is good too. Controls are nice. Wish the game was a little longer though, but it's still fun to play. Galaxy S4 I9500.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Wonderful show and acting, but hard to enjoy when it freezes two or three times during one episode. A recurring problem, so far with all my free streaming with Amazon.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|If following videos, while doing some exercises are your thing, this app is perfect for you. Very easy to navigate & use. Graphics and Videos are good, sound is ok too. Worth the purchase. Galaxy S4 (I9500).
B0064MGU98|3.0|Wonderful show and acting, but hard to enjoy when it freezes two or three times during one episode. A recurring problem, so far with all my free streaming with Amazon.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|VERY NICE, if you like Sudoku puzzles, this game is awesome. You can customize just about everything in this game, background colour, fonts, highlight colours, just about everything. Just about unlimited puzzles, with varying degrees of difficulty. You get FULL statistics and more. Worth it. Galaxy S4 I9500.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|GREAT App predicted text awesome,  multiple layouts.  Been using it for quite a while absolutely fantastic.  Always come back to..A must have application
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app's like a Soundboard, but with hundreds of Moody/Relaxing sounds, you can set the volume for each individual sound, and you can play multiple sounds simultaneously too. Start some sounds playing, set the volume, set the timer for the app shut down and that's it. I regularly fall asleep to this app. (Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500).
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Can it get better in mob movies than the Godfather?? I think not. And on Blu Ray...even better! Love it!
B00AK57N00|4.0|Easy to play, difficult to master, fun game to play for quick bursts of fun. Graphics, sound and controls are good. Galaxy S4 I9500.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read. Chris really makes you feel his trials and tribulations....and also his joys. It is written in a great way t that keeps your attention.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|If you want an app to help you to fall asleep, rather get &#34;Relax Melodies Premium&#34;, because &#34;Lightning Bug - Sleep Clock&#34; is not that good, especially because you have to pay for this app. STAY AWAY.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was fun. it did seem tow be a bit short but what can you expect from a free game? it had me thinking and the puzzels were not impossible to complete.
B00C0UHGLO|4.0|Kind of like a variation of chess/checkers, very weel made game, looks good, sounds good & plays well. I got it free, but it's definitely worth the price.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|The first time I downloaded the app it worked great.  Now it keeps crashing and won't let me open it.  I hope they will fix the app soon because it's one of my favorite games.  I have the first generation Kindle Fire.  I will change my review to 5 stars as soon as the app is fixed.
1781162646|5.0|great mystery. just as good as Stephen King gets. I especially like the ending on the ferris wheel. Five stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game that keeps getting harder. Love it. Will give you countless hours of playtime. And take your time on the harder levels
B008YRVW0I|4.0|.<br />I have this game on my pc but the kindle version is better.Very easy game to play with quick results
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun, challenging, but regrettably short.  Beat it in about an hour.  Good game for free app store, though.  Would probably pay for expanded version.
B005HSL626|4.0|Somehow I got the full version on the free version so that was great. But when the new update came out, and out of nowhere the game started lagging and I couldn't slice anything. So I have to download it over and over again when it happens. But its a really good game that I would recommend for everyone. Hopes for the future, they will fix that. Then I would give them five stars.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This was a suggested reading book for freshman entering University of Evansville. It was an awesome book. I couldn't put it down. The story was so inspiring.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is aimed a teen audience, but I am we'll beyond that.  My children are past their teens!  Nevertheless, this was a series of books I almost couldn't put down.  Parallels with politics, sports, war and many other aspects of life continuously arise so that even the mature reader desires to know how it will turn out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app my brother and I play it 24 hours a day it is the best game<br />Ever this is her brother and yea she is right it's the best game yet
B000002AH7|5.0|I purchased this CD for memories from my youth!<br />And it brought it all back to me!!!!!!<br />IT was WONDERFUL
B0087HT36U|4.0|i do like games like this. there are bugs like fragments not vanishing leaving an invisible part that holds up an otherwise demolished structure.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As the hot and sexy story of Gideon and Eva continues to sizzle, I can't get enough. Erotically charged, emotionally capturing, Sylvia Day at her very best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|What I love about this game is that it feels like you are using your brain without straining it. I also like that the escapes aren't all similar. But my reason for only four stars is because some of the escapes take QUITE a long time. Still I love the graphics,and my personal favorite level is level 7. All in all this is a great brain game.
B000058BGZ|5.0|I don't know who Schoenberg is; I bought this solely because I'm a fan of Uchida.  Of course, the musicianship is perfect; however - to me - the music has a psychotic feel to it, like something you would hear in a Hitchcock movie or Twilight Zone.  Maybe I'll play it at the front door next Halloween.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks that has came out in a long time. It is one that will be remembered for a long time.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This is a great song.  And not just for young people.  I'm 50 and I still love it.  I saw the ad on TV and then later at my daughter's graduation, heard it being played during one of the functions.  Love it!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|the left earpiece died on me. its really not worth it  go with sony  for about the same price  its all around better
0545123275|3.0|I am an adult who enjoys young adult novels from time to time.  they are high emotion, high drama, easy reads.  shiver is all these things.  although a little boring at times I was able to keep going and enjoyed the love story quite a bit.<br />what I couldn't get past was the teenage dialogue.  I am sure there are teens that talk like this, but reading it made my skin crawl.  Sam is a well-read young man and he and grace seem older when together, but when she is around her friends I could hardly get through the teenage banter.  I imagine any teen reading this would feel it was a typical adult trying too hard to be cool.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|After a few levels the game is going well. The levels build nicely, with each a little more challenging than the last<br />. Interesting. Fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Looking past all the hot sex...It truly is a great love story. I Would recommend reading it. Definitely a chick read.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Needed something I could pack a few things and throw over my shoulder. The straps on this backpack came up short. It was okay with both straps on my shoulder, but rode too high for my liking.<br />With one strap on my shoulder, the padding didn't cover my shoulder comfortably. Too bad. Seems like a descent bag, but came up a little short. Literally.<br />I might give the sling bag a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE subwaysuffer its a great game to play when your bord or when your just at school and need something to do its also great wheni am watching little kid and they are being lound and anoyying just line them up and let them play subwaysuffers and they will be find
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Best Steve McQueen movie of all time.<br />Great scenes of older San Francisco. Nostalgic but still a classic! Must have.
1781162646|2.0|Joyland had huge potential about a possible haunted horror house. I was very excited to get this book because I was hoping King had written another of his fabulous stories like It or Salem's Lot. The story simply fades away into some great writing but a put me to bed and wake me when its over type of story. Nothing happens in this story. Seriously, nothing happens in this story unless you really get excited about a guy wearing a fur costume. This book is only 283 pages, which is like a short story for King lately, but this also thrilled me. His past few books like Under the Dome have been so long and detailed, that by the end of the story, I was exhausted and disappointed by the ending. I felt his books have become long and detailed just to prove he can write them but there isn't a point in doing so. I read Joyland in a few days but as short as it was, I struggled to finish it.<br /><br />The cover should have been of a boy in a fur costume--not a girl in a short skirt, ready to scream. There is no scary moments in this story. It's about a man named Devin, recollecting back to when he lost his first girlfriend. Throughout the story, the reader is painfully reminded about the first girl he fell in love with. Devin goes to work at a carnival over the summer and tries to get over his broken heart--boring. Joyland is about a boy working at a carnival, wearing a fur suit--he's really good at it--and the language of carnies. I was never drawn into Devin as a character. There was a murder at the funhouse and a ghost is rumored to live there and is seen only by carnies, but Devin never does. He does, however, finally meet a beautiful woman and a boy with psychic powers--we'll get to that in a moment--but this doesn't happen until the end of the book!<br /><br />I have no idea why many of King's books have characters in it that are psychic. Joyland has a boy that can read minds, as did The Shining, Dreamcatcher, Insomnia, and others. I am beginning to think King has lost his imagination. His writing is fantastic, but his stories have become too much detail and not much bang for the buck. If it wasn't for the great writing of King, I would have given this book a one star instead of two. I have no idea why people seem to want to suck up and give this story four or five stars, it wasn't good at all. Great writing doesn't make for a great story, just as a great story can't make up for bad writing.<br /><br />There was one more thing that bothered me about the book. Why does he have to tell us about his political views? Out of no where, he writes on one of the last pages of his disgust that Dick Cheney got a brand new heart but more talented people like Clarence Clemons deserve one? Who is he to tell us who deserves one and who doesn't? I don't agree with his political views and if he really finds the need to tell us about them, write a book about it, don't put it on one of the last pages of the novel. We don't care about your political views.<br /><br />If your looking for a great book by King, look to one of his old stories like Pet Cemetary or The Stand but forget about this book.imagination.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This is the most well written and interesting, aside from educational, show we have seen in a long time.  Great cast, fantastic acting and real plausible situations since I have worked in the legal field myself for many years and hold a paralegal degree as well.  Thank you for offering this program on Prime.  We can't wait for season 3 to begin next month!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|this was a great bargain! to have the complete set of all the series at such a great price is awesome
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is an exciting puzzle getting harder then a little easy and so on.  There are bunches of levels.  It works perfectly on the kindle fire HD!  If you have any doubts, you shouldn't!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years. I've already read the other two and this trilogy beats any of the other series I've ever read. Great job suzanne
0307352153|3.0|Upon an introvert friend's recommendation, I wrestled through this book in order to give it a fair review. My problem all the while being that the author never provided her definition of \\"introversion\\" until page 268 (right before the author's acknowledgements).<br /><br />It would have been good to know from the get-go that she uses the term \\"introversion\\" to describe the quality of being: \\"reflective, cerebral, bookish, unassuming, sensitive, thoughtful, serious, contemplative, subtle, introspective, inner-directed, gentle, calm, modest, solitude-seeking, shy, risk-averse, thin-skinned.\\" (She also draws on a few scientific definitions, but doesn't say to what extent exactly.) Needless to say, this differs greatly from the general definition of introversion and makes the title as well as much of the content of the book misleading.<br /><br />I agree with many of  the 1- and 2-star reviews here but give it a 3rd star for readability and because I think that Cain wrote this in the sincere hope that quiet people get their fair share of legitimacy.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|These guys were playing at an event I went to, and while I unfortunately missed their performance, I went ahead and looked them up. This album is amazing, some songs take a little getting used to, but once you've heard them a few times you can't get them out of your head. I love the lyrics, and can't help but empathize when it comes to songs like Migraine and Car Radio. I've already listened to this album 100+ times, and don't intend to stop anytime soon :)
B00969PR18|1.0|Looked good till at certain scales found that the sea dried up or odd shaped lakes appear where no lake should be. To cap it all it froze my kindle ,a power off was required, and then it happened again!. Not sure if I'll let it happen third time.
B00CW665VI|5.0|**5 out 5 Stars**<br /><br />Read my full review at [...]<br /><br />This book is awesome! I have not laughed this much in so long. Drew is hilarious. I love the way his mind works and his inner monologues are something to be read. I loved the reading style. The book is told from his POV and he's talking to you as if telling a story. It's like you're a friend and he's telling you how they<br />came to be, with some very interesting POV's on other things. I spent most of my time reading this book either laughing or shaking my head. The characters are lovable and intriguing. I love the plot. Give it a try!<br /><br />Kate is beautiful with long dark hair and the perfect figure. Drew thinks of her as a hot teacher or a sexually oppressed librarian. She's very professional, smart, has a quick wit and keeps Drew on his toes. She's not one to mess with either. She's ruthless when it comes to work. She'll knock Drew on his butt before he knew what happened. They are both a little on the immature side of things though.<br /><br />Drew is a douche bag. There just isn't another word for him. He's cocky, conceded, arrogant, selfish, spoiled, and a flippin rockstar in his eyes. He is a womanizer in the worst way. He picks up and throws away women like it's another day's work. He drop dead beautiful, filthy rich, and at the top of his game. He wouldn't know how to treat a woman if he tired. All that being said I love him. He's hilarious! His view on things is just ridiculous at times. He's an alpha male, controlling and possessive. When he finally finds the woman he wants he will do anything and I mean anything to make sure he keeps her.<br /><br />Drew meet's Kate in a bar and she turns him down. Imagine his surprise when she shows up as the new girl at his firm. From there you get to see how a douche bag turns into a lovesick puppy and then how he wins her love.<br /><br />It's a pretty short book but worth it. So this book gets 5 stars because it's awesome! I haven't laughed that hard in a long, long time. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a little long in places but never a dull moment.that hard in a long, long time. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a little long in places but never a dull moment.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|So...yeah. I'm really bad at Sudoku, but I thought I'd give this app a try anyway. And I'm glad I did! So far I'm only doing Very Easy levels (though they seem very hard to me!) and I've really enjoyed them! I can't figure out how to get hints yet, but the gameplay itself is pretty simple.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|EVERY TIME I GET TOO FAR IN A RUN THE GAME SHUTS DOWN! ITS PURE AND UTTER BS! IF IT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN I WOULD GAVE IT A BETTER SCORE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I have Beach Buggy Blitz, a free game by the same developer, and have really enjoyed it. I've found that I like Shine Runner for a lot of the same reasons. The graphics are awesome, and the racing itself is enjoyable. The only downside is that the handling on Shine Runner is a lot more difficult to master; I prefer the tilt to the touch control. That has to be changed under Options. Once you figure it out, there really aren't any other downsides.<br /><br />Another thing I like about Shine Runner is the trading part of the game. It gives more depth to it than just the racing. You go to a handful of shops, buy stuff cheap and sell it at a profit. The goal is to make as much money as you can. You have ten days to do it; each time you visit a shop represents one day.<br /><br />I don't really see any way you can \\"lose\\" the game. I suppose if you bought a lot of stuff at a high price near the end of the game, you may end up with a negative score. There are also police that chase you throughout the game, and you see more of them the more \\"notorious\\" you get, according to the game. It doesn't really seem like they can stop you or anything, though.<br /><br />Overall, great game. Definitely worth getting as the FAOTD.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is a great app on my kindle fire. I wish there was an option for using music already on the kindle, but hey, I only have the free version. The digital alarm is very useful for a deep sleeper like me who needs something loud and piercing to wake up to. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a simple alarm.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have never written a review on Amazon before despite being a regular customer but this book definitely motivated me to do one since I had such a negative experience. I enjoyed the 2 previous books and was expecting this book to be the culmination of the story but instead I ended up reading page after page of non sense and an ending that is the lamest ending of any book I have read, series or otherwise.  I was not paying attention to the pages left on my kindle hoping the story would get better and then all of a sudden, it was the end of the book. What?! Not wasting any more time or money on this series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is realu great. it lets me have multiple alarms going at once. I really love the fact that I can use my songs as ring tones.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Two of my favorites, I watch them over and over.  Robert and Tommy are perfect, and I'd say a little poke was worth a 5 dollar gold piece any day too!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain teaser! Kind of addictive but in a good way. Love all the little details of the rooms-so cute!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game.  I can't put it down.  I can't wait for new levels to be available.<br /><br />I have to fight with my daughter over who gets to play.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a good read and kept me coming back, but I think the ending could have been better.  If you've seen the movie, you need to read the book.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|I know Dawkins has a lot to say on the subject, but he is very verbose, and I found the book to be tedious to read for me.  This is probably more of a reflection of me and not Dawkins.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|There have been a lot of claims that the original sound is back.  I've been a Queensryche fan since hearing them on \\"Metal Shop\\" in 1984.  I almost agree with these claims.  The one thing that is still missing are some of the echo effects seen in songs like \\"Screaming in Digital\\", \\"NM156\\" and \\"Empire\\".  Bring back those effects and then I'd have to fully agree that the original sound of Queensryche is back.<br /><br />Short of that one missing component, I never thought I'd see the day that someone could pull off a Geoff Tate like sound.  Todd LaTorre gives an awesome performance!  If you liked early Queensryche, then this CD is a \\"must have\\"!<br /><br />For the record (no pun intended), I'd give it five stars if it had the echo effects as well.
0307474259|5.0|While I thought he dwelled on some his justifying examples way too much, when he got to the chemistry and gave his explanation of how the body works and how specific patterns of eating can put the body into a mode where it will never burn fat and only store it, I was hooked.<br />This is NOT a diet book.  This doesn't give you a diet to follow.<br />I was able, however, to change how/what/when I eat (nothing really drastic) and loose 30 lbs (15%) at a rate of about 5 lbs a month and have kept it off for over a year with some pretty simple changes in eating habits based on what I learned here.<br />This was worth every penny to me.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family! We bought it for the 3D version and it didn't disappoint!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While many point out the similarities with Battle Royale and there are many the striking difference is in how the contestants are assembled and also that they receive training of a sort. You also have to take into consideration  the governmental aspects and how this story is very anti control and more about individual freedom and liberty to pursue ones life.
0525952926|5.0|The book is a great follow-on to the first in this trilogy,and I look forward to the conclusion of the epic. The service and delivery were done with efficiency and despatch.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I am a new runner and a plant based athlete.  Scott's book encouraged me on both fronts and gave me a peek at what drives a serious runner.  He has helped found the questions to ask myself.  Now my journey is taking on dimension .
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life is one of best albums ever recorded. I loved it ever since I first heard it on vinyl in 1976. It's Thought-Provoking! It's Brilliant! It's a Masterpiece!
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Incredible!<br /><br />As musicians age they acquire a better palette to work with. Separation is a good thing as it allows band mates to develop different sounds and ideas to bring to the table. (And straighten out there act)  The music is very interesting in this album both modern and classic. But, more polished and refined then what they have ever done.<br /><br />I'm so glad that they decided to work together again and show the world what they can really do!<br /><br />One reviewer stated that is may be their best album. I agree, I think this is their best album to date.<br /><br />And, would like to issue a challenge to the band.<br /><br />MAKE ANOTHER ONE EVEN BETTER!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Helps me allot with balancing my money expenses.<br />Thank you, since I'm an old lady.... =-)<br />Keep doing great job. May God Almighty bless you all, always.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For the first few chapters, I was kinda under whelmed. Then POW! It grabs you and won't let go! Poor Amy. Poor Nick. POW POW! Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. Through all the mayhem the author has some pretty good insights into relationships and the media circus we've become accustomed too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|To put it lightly I read the first boo in three days and this  on  in two it was so well written that it put me in a place where I knew Ana personally. A complete and utter must read
B005LAIH2W|4.0|It's as if Andrew Stanton loved parts of the book, and hated other parts.  Some parts are as bang-on faithful as anybody could hope for in a book-to-movie adaptation, and other parts make you wonder if anybody connected to the movie had even read the blurb on the back of the book.<br />As a movie it' pretty good, it's only as an adaptation that I really have complaints.  That why it four stars instead of only three, though it there had been an option for three and a half, I'd've gone with that.  If you've never read the books, you'll like it a lot more.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I got bored with this book pretty early on.  It provides some information but seems like repeats from several other books I've read on the subject so nothing really new here in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good time waster. I can't figure out how to train. I spent a lot of time waiting for the activities to finish whatever they r doin
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing this game!  i can't wait for more floors.  I once I got the hang of it,  I escaped.  I would hope I could think that quick if I ever needed to escape in real life.
B002KJX4IE|3.0|It seems that the movie was trying too hard to be funny.  It wasn't just naturally funny.  It's a little inappropriate for children.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|This doesn't work at all.  Wasted money. I wanted to used so i wouldn't have to turn the volume up on the tv. No good
B00633W614|4.0|Enjoyed the book  Interesting characters.  Moved quickly as the lives eloped contemporaneously for each character.  Interesting to see the friends across classes being overridden by the class system.
B000KG499M|5.0|As soon as I bought my first Gundam model I had to buy one of these. To build this stand was very easy and quick. It makes your model stand out in any room; just pose your gundam, place somewhere in a room and your good to go!
B009OCR1X4|3.0|I hate that I'm giving this 3 stars, but I feel that's what the soundtrack deserves based off sound quality. I absolutely loved the music in the film so I bought the soundtrack right away but then when I went to listen to it I started noticing all the background noises from the orchestra throughout some of the tracks that were my favorites. For me, these noises are extremely distracting, especially when getting lost in the music (which deserves 5 stars itself). I swear I even heard someone talking in the background at one point. Very disappointed.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I have purchased two other books about self-publishing phenomenon. They were good books, full of valuable witness accounts collected from many authors. Great motivational books for a starting author.<br /><br />But David's book goes far beyond that. There are witness accounts -33 of them- but they do not make up the bulk of the book. It's not only about inspirational words and stories, it's about facts.<br /><br />The book tells you everything you need to know about how the self-publishing boom started, how it works, considerations on its future, all the pro and cons, how you should conduct yourself to make it a real profession. And at the end of it, you can't help but to feel a little proud, because you realize you're riding the wave or that you could be riding it right now.<br /><br />Don't be mistaken, this is not an end-all guide to become the perfect indie author. It won't guide you step by step. What it does is giving you just enough input and hints to be able to go, research and experiment further, because -I think David maybe shares my opinion- some things are to be learned hands-on to really make them yours.<br /><br />Except that you need a professional editor. That should be taught in primary school.<br /><br />Meinos Kaen
B000QUCPWU|5.0|Like the title said, they were the best.  Don't believe me?  Ask anyone &#34;over 30&#34; from Down South, like The Allman Brothers, past and present, for instance (DO kinda look over the Skynyrd and Mally Hatchett factions though...)  They and Otis Redding were responsible for Soul Music, a music that indeed CAME from one's very soul.  Particular tracks of note are &#34;Green Onions,&#34; and don't tell me you never heard THAT; their take on &#34;Hang 'Em High,&#34; from the &#34;spaghetti-westerns&#34; so prevalent in the sixties; and my favorite of all time is &#34;Hip Hug Her.&#34;  You remember in the Stones' (probably the very LAST) great single, &#34;Start Me Up,&#34; when Mick sings that one verse about the song protagonist's remarkable &#34;recuperative powers,&#34; i.e., &#34;you make a dead man c**?&#34;  Well, FORGET &#34;Start Me Up&#34; - Keef would agree! - that little lick organist Booker T plays and guitarist Steve Cropper kinda finishes would make the above &#34;deceased&#34; get up and dance.  And the other two musicians in the MG's (&#34;Memphis Group&#34;), bassist Donald &#34;Duck&#34; Dunn, and drummer Al Jackson, have gone on to be with The Lord now - but what a rhythm section there is in Heaven now!  A rhythm section so TIGHT, a rhythm section so &#34;hand in glove&#34; that it even marginally outshone the #1 rhythm section in Rock and Roll, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts - and they both would agree!
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Strong story line looking into family and friends with various but similar mental issues. How they live, love and survive. If you can get past the very foul language it's not a bad movie.
B00AEFXNGE|4.0|I saw this flick on opening weekend and loved it. The first person perspective really worked for me. It puts the viewer in the situation in such a way that you only know what the characters know. So even though it doesn't tie things up with a neat bow or have the \\"well you see Timmy\\" moment; it does make the viewing experience feel genuine. After all, how many times have we watched a major event unfold on the news and really known what was going on? The media doesn't even get the story right at first. Now place yourself in the situation, all you hear is an explosion, then people screaming and running away. That is what this movie is like.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I guess I am fussy, but I like my videos to be what I saw on stage.  This is the real &#34;Phantom&#34;  with no extra special effects or changes in the script and story.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I can't help but smile or dance around whenever this song comes on the radio.  It doesn't have so much of a 70s feel as it just has a retro/classic/funk feel.

B009GXHOW4|3.0|I watched my two little cousins use this app on their kindle fire HDs and they did some really cool stuff for it, and it looked like a lot of fun. I got it on my normal kindle fire though, and suddenly started experiencing strange problems that had never occurred before. This app looked like it had a lot of potential, but sadly I'm going to have to remove it. I will give it three stars though simply because it did work on my cousins devices without a problem.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game! i know how to build monster spawners and stuff. it is so fun i could play it forever! and for all of you people with a kindle fire to update it delete it and get it back. that works for me. anyways this game is and will always be the best game ever!

B004IYISSK|4.0|So glad I finally read this little gem. Packed with wisdom.<br />Now  I can happily cross this book off my list.
0307719219|4.0|This book explores why some nations fail and others do not. The authors lay out their thesis early on (Pages 3-4):  \\"Countries such as Great Britain and the United States  became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who controlled power and created a society where political rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take advantage of economic opportunities.\\"<br /><br />In the process of addressing their thesis, the authors also look critically at some competing theories--geography, culture, ignorance. One comparison that serves the authors well is the fates of North Korea and South Korea, and why their well-being has diverged so widely.<br /><br />The authors provide a wide ranging analysis, including a critique of managed economies and a question about the staying power of high fliers such as China.<br /><br />One question that occurs to me, though, is how certain examples of increasing economic differences and, in the United States, Court decisions that enhance the power of economic powers might play out. Are there potential problems facing some of the democracies with increasing inequality? Only time will tell, but it is a question that arises when looking at the data.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting and important work.

0374214913|5.0|Debut novels, come in all shapes and sizes. Frankly some are fairly dire. Others start promisingly then lose their way as the author overcomplicates things or starts to waffle. A few are outstanding and Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore certainly falls into this category. I was captivated from the first few pages, which, incidentally describe the jobless situation of Clay Jannon, the main character. This could have been quite a depressing episode, but sets the scene for the rest of the book in that the writing was excellent.<br /><br />Following this jobless period Clay manages to get employment on the night shift at Penumbra's. This is a strange, narrow, almost vertical bookshop accessed by ladders. It has a small number of more popular books up front and the strange `Waybacklist' behind. There are very few customers and they normally request volumes from the Waybacklist. Their requests are recorded in a handwritten ledger including details about the demeanour and appearance of the customer. Very strange, and, of course, Clay is eager to know what is actually going on and starts to carry out his own investigation aided by his rather geeky group of friends.<br /><br />What follows can best be described as a quest to solve a centuries old problem. Old practices and arcane ways collide with modern technology in the shape of the all-conquering Google with its huge computer based capacity to solve problems and the outcome is clever and rather unexpected. I will not give away any more of the plot as this is a book to savor and to be surprised at. What it is not, however, is a supernatural, wizardy type story which a reader of the synopsis may have assumed. It may also leave you cold if you have no feel at all for modern technology, but as you are reading an Amazon review I would assume this is not the case.<br /><br />Overall this is a wonderful book which captivated me throughout and the only disappointment at the end was that there were not another couple of hundred pages or so. I thought the epilogue, written in the future tense, was quite masterful as a finale. Highly recommended and an author to watch out for in the future.s or so.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|The book unmasks the horrors of the Hermit Kingdom as it corrupts and destroys the very essence of humanity, while also telling the story of one man's quest to find his own humanity.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I bought this DVD because I got tired of waiting for this lovely film to show up on cable.  It always leaves me with a smile and I highly recommend for anyone over the age of 50 (younger viewers lacking life experience might not get the full emotional impact.)  Wonderful cast and performances were spot on.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Either is ok, but then I don't really play it either way.  It is boring and does nothing for my brain!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great story.  Great acting.  It brought up about every emotion.  I felt it was a very meaningful movie and very much worth seeing.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Sorry, I am NOT a facebook fan at all.  It is &#34;in your face&#34; way too much for me.  I can access my account without a separate app.  That is when I want to!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I really love this movie!  It was great to receive a free rental with my purchase as well.  Thank you!
0425252868|4.0|Very moving story. It serves to remind us that the pain and terror of war is often used to gloss over the simple humanism of ordinary people. It is further proof, if anybody still needs it, that the greatest mass murderers throughout history have always been people's own governments.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game lots of fun makes makes you use your brain. Good challenging game. A definite download  you are crazy not to

B00006J3WH|5.0|Grew up a Buffy fan. Whedon fan. The standard obsessions develop of course. I've listened to this cast album so many times I have lost count (and so has my iTunes/iPod). Blast the speakers, turn up the volume, or smash the earbuds into your ears. You'll end up breaking down this song into itty-bitty pieces like I and so many other fans do. Hints of some obvious (or even not-so-obvious) homages to other musicals. And we all know Whedon loves Sondheim. So listen for all that. :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I absolutely love this app  I play it for hours awesome upgrades , I didn't think I would like it, but now I can't put it down. Would definitely recommend getting this app. 5 stars
B0064YOWCI|1.0|I did not want to give any stars to the 3D version that I purchased, but it is a requirement to write a review.  The disc that I purchased would not play on my 3D player because the region was incorrect.  I had purchased the 3D disc from a seller in North Carolina but it does not play on American players.  Buyers \\"BEWARE\\".
034580404X|4.0|Well I know those folks who know about literature say this series is not \\"great literature.\\"  Fortunately, I never studied great literature and found the books to be enjoyable, erotic reads.  She clearly understand the dynamics of a BDSM relationship and does a good job moving the stories and characters along with some interesting twists.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I also can't update this app and I'm pretty sure it is because I have the Free version of TuneIn preloaded on my HTC EVO 4G LTE. Because it is a preloaded app I do not have the option to uninstall it nor does the Pro version install over the Free version. If I uninstall the Pro version then I get the app with the most current update, but I then lose all my settings and favorites.<br /><br />I would like to give 5 stars because this is an awesome app and if you don't have a preinstalled version I would definately recommend installing. If a workaround for this issue is released I would love to up my star rating.

B006CHML4I|2.0|While I like the look of this watch, which is why I bought it and the only reason I'm giving two rather than one star; it fails in its very essential function - keeping time. I understand that it is self-winding, but even when wearing it daily, the watch will either gain time or lose time, depending on how mobile I am. Every morning, after taking it off at night, I have to not only update the time, but also the date and day of the week. I like the look and still wear it often, but I find that I rarely use it for the time, knowing that it will not be accurate.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you use your noggin! A must have for all puzzle enthusiasts. Just when you think it's a piece of cake, you get in a room you can't get out of.
0345525558|5.0|well written, I enjoyed it from beginning to the end, and I missed reading it for the next 4 days.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game! Good for those who love to solve puzzles and like a game with mystery. The only thing I found wrong with the game is the length of it. It is short but I am ready for the next one. Totally worth the money

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I enjoy this game and play it on my kindle fire. it works well for the most part but I have had to reinstall twice now. once the game got to a certain levelthe first uninstall came because it wouldn't open. second uninstall was due to reaching a higher level but then it would open but not connect to the server. I enjoy the game but after I reinstalled it both times I had to create a new User profile as it would not recognize the old one(s) and had to restart my reef. fortunately I do not make in app purchases so I didn't lose anything. if it happens again I will be uninstalling and not reinstalling
B00AAX68HG|5.0|it is a great game and is it pudding or jello because I cant decide I think its jello though

B008X6N1OA|5.0|Great movie. Fun for all ages. My 7 year old son loves the Ice Age movies. Entertaining for adults too.
6304698798|1.0|This is my all-time favorite movie.  I have 2 different versions of it already, but don't have one with the original Dolby 1.0 Audio.  The description of this DVD says it's the 1998 version, but it is NOT THE 1998 VERSION.  The DVD case clearly says '2006' on it, and the Audio is the re-dubbed 2002 version where Eli Wallach sounds like and old man and Lee Van Cleef is voiced by a completely different actor (since he was already dead at the time of the re-recording in 2002).  Greatest movie of all time, but DO NOT BUY if you are looking for the original audio.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|I bought this for my hubby's birthday ... it is one of his all time favorite movies and he was very happy to finally have his own copy!
B0047SF41G|3.0|I wasn't disappointed in this film per se, but I was bored a little sometimes. It just seems, I don't know, kind of slow. It is very well done, but I didn't really like it all too much. I recommend for fans of science fiction.
B00009R86L|2.0|I got this strap to make carrying my ukulele case more comfortable (tenor ukulele Ameritage case...so the case is built like a Hummer.)  The pad fit perfectly on the relatively thin Amertiage carrying shoulder strap.  But I immediately noticed that it added significant weight to the strap.  So when carrying the case by the handle, it not only makes the whole case heavier, but also turns the shoulder strap into an annoyance that can bump into your leg.  So if you plan to use this, plan to shoulder your bag/case the majority of the time.<br /><br />The pad had a nice contour to fit my shoulder, but simply was not that comfortable.  It is made of a denser foam which is on the firm side and can dig into your shoulder.  It just didn't work with me.  Another thing is that the area where the strap connects to the foam started to show separation from the first day.  I don't think it'll get any worse with use...but if it does, that'd be a big disappointment.<br /><br />I can understand why the USPS would use this strap: it's durable, does help to distribute weight, and postal carriers shoulder their bags the majority of the time.  But I don't think this is particularly well-suited for instrument cases.  Stick to using it for messenger bags.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I was captivated by this movie from the start of it. It began with a wonderful narration and visuals. Two worlds on top of each other, sort of the haves and have nots kind of story. The boy from the wrong side of the tracks falls for the girl on the Top side. The visual sci-fi/fantasy element was really well done. I'm a huge sci-fi fan so I knew I was at least going to like the concept of this movie and I was drawn in by the image on the cover, I hadn't even heard of this film or if I had seen a preview, I'd forgotten. The romantic in me loved the soul mates theme, I think it was very well-acted, I have not seen Jim Sturgess's other films yet but he was really good and Kirsten Dunst is great as always in my opinion. I think if you like the preview you'll like the movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I can add anything to the glowing reviews already offered.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I am a huge fan of science fiction and imaginative literature, and I teach a course on the same. I am always looking to find a new world to lose myself in, but more importantly, a new world to find my humanity reflected and refracted in in some new or astonishing way.<br /><br />This is that book.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Howey.<br /><br />I give this my highest possible recommendation, and I'm now reading the thus-far excellent Shift Omnibus VEEEEERRRRRRYYYYY slowly to make it last as long as possible.<br /><br />Read this book. It's as novel and fully-formed a construct as \\"Foundation\\" or \\"Neuromancer\\" or \\"Ender's Game.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />P.S. I enjoyed discovering that Mr. Howey reads every review, though how he has time to do this I do not know. Mr. Howey, thank you. I look forward to now reading your entire catalog. And thank you for being awesome enough to let other writers play in the sandbox you yourself created. I look forward to reading \\"NaNoWri War Z\\" . . . as soon as I finish World War Z first. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great read. I have read all 13 books and now have to wait until October to get the last one. It will be a long 4 months.

0240815807|5.0|I mix rap vocals, and this book is good, if you somewhat have a understanding of what everything does. I mainly scammed through the book to read what fits my particular situation the most. I would say it gave me a better understanding of what i needed to mess with as far as tweaking compression and eq. It also teaches you the importance of studio monitors and i would say that was a important factor to me considering the fact i didn't have my monitors angled right nor isolated from the shelves they sit on so i was getting some vibrations which was throwing off my hearing. I haven't really sat down and studied the reverb and delay section but i got an important tip on how the pre delay and release works for reverb so that's good. Also when you email Mike \\"HE WILL REPLY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION WITH EXACTLY WHAT HE THINKS!!!!\\" So that's a plus as he gave me some helpful tips. I would say the book is mainly towards mixing in a whole \\"like mixing instruments and vocals at the same time\\" but it also gives you an understanding on how to just mix vocals. So with this book, and some youtube videos you should be good if you're just starting out. YOU JUST GOTTA STUDY AND TAKE YOUR TIME!!! Also i know it's a long chapter but read through the listening part, because that really is the most important part!

B00CWY76CC|1.0|I  don't know what to do. It doesn't give you instructions.???!!  Mmmmmmm<br />So I think 100 floors or doors is better . It gives u more instructions. That why I gave this one star.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a great movie that portrays events leading up to the Iran Hostage crisis.  It gives pretty good background information while keeping things interesting.  Somewhat &#34;Made for TV&#34; in its last second crisis solutions but that is part of what keeps it interesting.
B003R0MF5S|4.0|It's funny, campy, creative, and nostalgic all rolled up into one 80s and 90s referencing show. It parodies lots of classic Americana spy movies & tv shows, while guest starring many actors.

0345529057|5.0|I'm not the kind of person who generally enjoys reading fiction, especially this genre. In fact, I can't even remember the last work of fiction I read cover to cover, but I'm positive it wasn't even half as long as one of these books. I gave it a shot because I liked the show and had heard great things from friends who read the books, and I fully expected to get about 200 pages in and then quit on reading it.<br /><br />Even knowing what would happen in the first two books, I raced right through them and enjoyed it even more the second time. The amount of detail that goes into character, plot and setting development made for great reading, and it left me even more satisfied than only watching the show. By the time I got to the third book before the last season of the show started, I was into the new stuff and had a really, really hard time putting the book down. The third book is DEFINITELY the best one thus far in the series. The way GRRM tells his story is exciting and terrifying at the same time, anything can happen to anyone it would seem. While the fourth book generally has less favorable reviews, I happen to be a big fan of it. People will knock it because it has significantly less action than the third book, which is true, and because a lot of key characters aren't in the book (GRRM split the 4th and 5th books to pretty much take place at the same time, each book only dealing with half the characters). The story slows down, but the plot is just as interesting in my opinion, and I still finished the 1000 page book in only a few weeks.<br /><br />Again, if you're hesitant to give this a shot because it's not really the style of reading you prefer, forget about it. It's THAT good that you'll love it anyway. I pushed the business and sports books aside to read this, and I couldn't be any happier with that decision. A little heads up, if you don't know what's happened in the show and don't want anything spoiled for you, DO NOT search for GoT content on the internet. Stay away from facebook comments, tweets, even basic internet searches. Take it all in through the book and don't risk seeing any of the spoilers, because people post them everywhere just to ruin it for others.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I haven't finished it, but its good so far.  I like his other books and this one is good too
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|Im a big fan of Demi Lovato and was happy when I finally recieved this CD yesterday. It came earlier than it said it would! The only down side is that it had a crack in the back of the CD case even though  i ordered it in \\"new condition\\" ,but the cd works so its okay. Anyone who is a fan of Demi should get this album. It's really good.
B008F5QQI2|5.0|If you like GM you will love this cd, The guy could sing the phone book and it would be a hit. He is great at whatever he does. love him.
B003M98792|1.0|The is no excuse for films that are dubbed without the option of the original language and subtitles.  The term \\"dubbed\\" should appear next to the title.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|the mechanics of the game are really great and i cant wait to see future updates it would be cool to see a flamethrower
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is amazing and since I do not PC to buy minecraft there I<br />believe this version will do
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Graphics are very nice. I wish the unlock was not so expensive, $4.99, but I think it will be worth the money.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book touches a lot of emotions and brings many interesting questions as to how we are to each other in relationships and egos.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This isn't as good as the others,but it's good. Not good good,just good. I don't know why but it's not as good as 'Rodrick Rules'.
161655164X|5.0|So it arrived today, i didn't expect it to not have cellophane, but considering i did not preorder it, it's understandable...  I'm a person who has sentimental quirks.....so i haven't played the game at all aside from the demo that comes with God of War Ascension.....and the first page i open the book to was Ellie's concept art...and unknowingly read the description of what was being shown..*SPOILER ALERT*..saying that they purposely made her wear long sleeved shirts to hide the fact that she is indeed infected...i almost destroyed it......  been waiting for two weeks to get this book so i can finally start the game and the very thing i'm waiting for spoiled it for me....i even avoided watching videos of it on youtube....haaah no matter it's still a great artbook, don't gat me wrong, this is by no means a rant or a bad review....I made the mistake... and i regret it...
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This season is hilarious (as per usual). Here we are introduced to Bernadette and (finally) Amy Farrah Fowler. This is a great buy for Big Bang fans!

B008AIGWVA|5.0|ITS AMUSING DEFINITELY. Sorry for all caps button got stuck, but the app itself is amusing and will keep my friends and family entertained for a while.
B0000696I0|5.0|I was happy I was able to find this and the other original turtle movie for my 4  year old. He is into Ninja turtles and this was perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a  very addictive game, but lots of fun. My lil grandson plays and enjoys the action. At 4 yrs old he can successfully play w/o frustration and the game intensifies enough to challenge adult adequately. Thumbs up on this one!
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I don't like this app don't use it it's just a waste of ur five minutes and you would need to download like 5 things
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much good game to burn time away. Ps love game so If u like run and dogeing things and runing from a security guard this game is perfect for u
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I love this game that's why I bought it. I really enjoy playing it. I also bought the other games by playrix.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Well I thought that this book deserved a 4 because it tells everything people like us what to write or how to write long or short sentences. It also explains symbols and short phrases we people use everyday in writing or in work areas .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very fun i will always play it i have games this is a close first so play people
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|I'm a screenplay writer and getting my hands on this was a priority. I also own it in bluray and its equally fantastic. Great film! Deserved every last Oscar.They just don't make films like this anymore.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game . It is very mysterious and fun to play . Screen shots are well made.it is addictive to play
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun to play great time saver fun for the whole family wouldn't change a thing about the game thank u for this excited game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a spectacular ending to the series. No loose ends. No questions. Just a well deserved happy ending
1451648537|4.0|This is a superbly written biography.  Jobs apparently was a difficult person to be around.  The author was clearly given personal access.  Does this interfere with his objectivity?  There is a reference to an incident where Jobs was displeased how a project was evolving,  and in his totally impetuous manner,  fired the project manager on the spot at a large meeting.  What was the effect on that individual?  The dozens (if not more)  he had laid to waste through the years?  I am not so sure that the pretty white,  fully integrated devices are worth the harm he did to so many others as he stompted his way to the top.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Have had several of these for several years. .  Mostly used with Maglite XL series lights, which fit perfectly, with just enough retention force.  Now using with new Mag-Tac model, which is a bit tighter fit, but still a nicer option (personal preference) than the clip supplied with that model.  After extensive use to date, none of these holsters has shown any deterioration.  On several occasions, the rotating belt clip has been useful as a \\"third hand,\\" allowing the light to illuminate the path or work task, leaving both hands free.<br /><br />Solid product; recommended.
0143038583|5.0|This is not something you will sit down and start reading and can't put it down.  It is informative, helpful and provocative to the mind.  Ideas you may not heard of, or have not considered in decades.
1609611543|3.0|After reading this book, I set out full speed ahead to get on the path of feeling better and loosing weight. However, after over a month of doing exactly as this book instructed, I have gained weight and I am feeling worse. I scheduled a visit with my internist this week and he told me this diet was entirely too drastic. I asked him if he thought I should have lost 5 lbs. or more this past month. He said that I certainly should have. My next step is to have my thyroid checked next week. I would strongly recommend that before starting the gluten free way of eating, you should first visit your family physician. The withdrawals were horrible. The book itself was very interesting as it had some great information about the difference in the wheat today as oppose to the wheat of the 1950's.<br /><br />I am going to have relax the diet in many ways but I will keep some aspects of it. Remember, talk with your physician before you start eating gluten free. If I had know a month ago what I know today, I would not have attempted this diet.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a fun cute game but does need some improvements like maybe just pay gems for other items but its one of the best games I've ever played in my life!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm glad this isn't the last Crossfire Novel!!!  I really enjoy the adventures and love of Gideon and Eva.  What a thriller this story turned out to be!!!
B00BD62X14|5.0|If you do you will enjoy the 11 French songs on this CD, n'est-ce pas?  Aussi, check out Carla's CD quelqu'un m'a dit.<br />I also recommend Madeleine Peyroux, who was born in Athens Georgia of French parents. Her latest CDs are The Blue Room and Standing On The Rooftop. She also has a song, albeit in English, on the new CD Give Us Your Poor to help end homelessness. Merci.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is fun and super entertaining. I never get bored while playing it and my sister has fun watching me play.I recommend it to anyone who anyone who gets bored easily.
B000MNOX7Q|1.0|The film has an excellent cast led by John Cusack, one of my favorites. It appears that the director James Mangold began the film with a Bates Motel model, but he is not Hitchcock. Rather than following a single character, Mangold follows a tangled web of implausable characters.<br />Don't waste your time watching Identity.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I loved this app until about four times using it i cant play videos. They're always loading! Please fix this and i will like it so much more!!!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great show and great cast - can't wait for the new season to start.  This ensemble knows how to act
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I had looked at several other cases that were really pricy. The price of this case was reasonable and after six months it is still in good shape. It provides great protection for my kindle. This case is a cute color and the design on the front adds a nice little touch to it! I was worried that the clips would break off, but they have not. I have a habit of clicking the one corner in and out of the case, and it has yet to break. Some of the reviews complain about how you cant charge the kindle when the case is closed. I just leave the case open when i charge it at night. I don't find it to be a big issue for me. I really do love how the cover turns the screen on and off when you open and close it. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and encourage others to buy it as well!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|It's always refreshing to come across films with great, realistic stories of not-so-timid charcaters. Bonus points for some really prominent stars, and killer dance number!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I purchased this game for my iPod and loved it. When I learned it was available for Kindle, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. I love this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game its a perfect on the go minecraft. Always updating for new things. The only thing that i would like to do that it doesnt have is the ability to downgrade and get a pre release. But other than that its a great app!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very addictive and my entire family can't stop playing it on my kindle fire. I can't believe how happy I get when I find or win keys. The different sceneries are great as well.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is a pretty good game, but u only get to play like 10 levels so you can choose to get it or not.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|I &#34;discovered&#34; Leonard Cohen only this year, so glad to be able to acquire his back catalog all at once and so easily. The sound quality of this reissue is fine, and the content is... well, it's Leonard Cohen. He gets a bad rap for being depressing; he's actually serious... serious about telling whatever emotional truth is before him, with a poetic richness and economy that is breathtaking. So glad I finally listened.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a great Sci-fi show and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys such shows. Think Walking Dead, but instead of zombies, survives are fighting aliens.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|&#34;Old stock. Dead battery. Would no longer take a charge from the start, caused by age. Contacted Fiio and they sent me a new battery that works fine. Not a good solution for those who don't have electronic experience at the component level. E17 is incredible.&#34;  Seller contacted me and it turns out they are an authorized repair center.  They could have taken care of the problem.  I don't have any problems with this seller. They really seem to be above board and quick with responses.  I will use them in the future.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Pixar movies are always entertaining, but there is more to them. In this movie a mother-daughter relationship is explored and the need to understand your past so you can appreciate your present and make a better future.  As usual the scenery is beautiful and the characters are more than animation. Great Job Pixar!
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|I'll count myself in the group of people who almost reached cult status when watching this movie. When this anniversary edition popped up on special in my inbox, I needed it. Love this movie so much.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I had very high expectations for these when I bought them. My standard xbox mic headset had been falling apart for a long time and I decided to make the investment when it was a gold box deal for $50.<br />I had been quite content with my soundbar and sub for gaming but with roommates and a girlfriend in surrounding rooms, late night gaming was not very polite thing to do. So, with this headset I can still enjoy my late night gaming with equal or better sound quality. At the moment I have only been playing Black Ops 2 with the headset and it has met my expectations and more. I am eager to try new and old games alike to test out the overall sound for other genre of games, and I feel that I will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Pros: Great overall sound quality, separate dials for bass, game, mic sound adjustment, comfortable feel with soft mesh ear pieces with air flow so your ears don't get sweaty, clear sounding mic on opposite players end, almost noise canceling.<br /><br />Cons: Quite a few wires, but understandable after experiencing the sound, but not overwhelming and good length.<br />Mic can sometimes be too loud on the other end from what my friends say, but mainly because the mic is too close to my mouth sometimes and picks up almost all sound around it, easy to adjust the mic to stay further away from my mouth.<br /><br />Overall well worth the investment if you play online multiplayer gaming and is compatible with almost every system.
1439153663|5.0|This is one of the most well-written and absorbing books I've read in a while.<br />I hope Ms Grissom writes more like it.<br />I will highly recommend it to my book club colleagues in the fall.<br />The Kitchen House should be made into a movie.
B004UG7RQ0|2.0|The volume is too low. I am hoping there is a fix to this problem. The product works as advertised but the volume issue makes it close to worthless.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|We rented this movie from Amazon last night. We found the speech dialogue in many places to be garbled and unintelligible. We have a very good quality home theater system that we have fine tuned to emphasize movie speech dialogue intelligibility. This movie from Amazon was not available in Dolby surround sound nor was closed captioning available. I just cannot believe in this day and age that a recent movie release, such as this one isn't available in Dolby surround sound, which promotes clear speech dialogue through a home theater system's center speaker. These short comings of this movie from Amazon are ridiculous considering that Amazon charges a $4.99 rental price, the same price that you can rent an actual DVD copy of this movie, which would have most likely Dolby surround sound as well as closed captioning. Four of us watched this movie last night. Everybody was saying, \\"I can't hear it, what did they say?, turn up the volume\\". All, which of course seriously detracted from enjoying what was probably a good movie with decent acting performances from big name actors. It's a shame that their good work was mired with this problem.<br /><br />We have also found unfortunately that most of the movies that we have rented and streamed from Amazon have had similar speech dialogue intelligibility problems. We have complained to Amazon about this problem several times in the past. Amazon has yet to do anything to solve this problem, just continue to raise rental prices. These ongoing problems have limited our movie rentals from Amazon. Instead we stream movies from Netflix (unlimited rentals for about $8.00 per month), which do not have these problems. What we don't understand is why Netflix has effectively addressed these issues and Amazon seemingly cannot or doesn't care to.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I have read 13 of Mr. Child's novels with Jack Reacher and just purchased 2 more, The Affair and Nothing to Lose.  So, Yes, I do enjoy and have enjoyed the Jack Reacher series.  All have wonderful plots and keep your attention throughout.  My problem still is that once I start on the novel it's most difficult to put down.  Die Trying is # 2 for Mr. Child and what I have found is that it is best to start here or with the first novel and then go forward, not that you can't pick up his latest and enjoy it But it's more fun to start with those first novels and proceed through all of them.  Mr. Child's books certainly are far more enjoyable than Television and I to read a little before turning off the lights for sleep. Hollywood can't do Mr. Child's books, it's far better to read them.  Cliff Mitts
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Wow.  Crisp sound quality, breezy playing, soulful backup vocals and an eclectic (rock, blues, gospel) song selection make for an incredible listen.  Throw in Bela Fleck on two tracks, plus some of the coolest cover/cd art I've seen in a while, including two fun photos of Jerry jamming with Bela, and this is simply a steal (your face) at $12-ish.  A perfect summer purchase.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle game is very fun I would recommend it to anyone it has very cool puzzles and a lot to chose from !!!
B004132HZS|5.0|As a big fan of Jeremy Brett's Homles I was skeptical of a modern day Sherlock. When I finally got a chance to watch I was hooked!  I couldn't get the 2 seasons fast enough and I can't wait for the third. Benedict is so fun to watch solve crimes and Martin is a wonderful Watson. I hope they continue this series for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is the best horse game ever, everyone should play this game . Good luck with your horses
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should get this game. Very addictive. I love this game. Another hit from Gameloft!! 5 Stars.  I think there should be another world like Vector's place.. Other wise, great game!! :D
B009VIZDLI|5.0|There is a lot we can learn from Don, our central character, important stuff like:  how everything we need to know can be learned from a book, how comforting a schedule can be when the world appears chaotic, how to improvise by using a skeleton to master ballroom dancing in the absence of a live partner and most important of all, how we can become so focused on achieving our goals that we inadvertently break our most cherished rules. And, once we do, there's no going back. Don is a guy who is never going to fit in, but being wired up differently doesn't mean he is exempt from the basic human desire to love and be loved. This is the story of how Don learns about love - in all its florid comic glory - it is book that is well written and thoroughly engaging from start to finish.<br /><br />The orthodoxy holds that Aspies lack empathy, yet this book challenges the notion by asking questions about how love and empathy are connected. We may not be able to deploy empathy as part of our everyday emotional vocabulary, but the way I see it - learning about love and empathy are all a matter of focus, and a bit like a second language. An opposing theory holds that some Aspies over-empathize, and this idea has been taken up in the detective genre and has been built into wonderful fictional characters such as Will Graham, star of the new Hannibal TV Series.<br /><br />The Rosie Project is a wonderful rom-com that adds to the stock of fictional characters who are Aspies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. Is totes worth $7. You can do so much more with this update. There is cake, buckets, eggs, oh the best part is that you can catch on fire in the lava.
B00AEFXTKO|5.0|This is honestly one of my top three movies of all time. It exceeded my expectations by far. I will never be the same after seeing this movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|excellent app. My 2 year old uses my kindle a lot and this app lets me know how much time I have left for all the functions on the kindle:watching video, browsing and so on.Very easy to use.
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|If you went to any of the BB 50th tour shows, you'd like this as a reminder of that probably never-to-be-repeated event.  The BB have split up again (big surprise).  These takes have been sweetened in the studio with some overdubbing.  Not that it hurts things too badly, but there is an obvious omission here of Don't Worry Baby.  Brian's backing band is killer, and the harmonies those road pros make the BB themselves sound a little lame.  Bruce Johnston sounds particularly weak and airy on his lead, and I don't know why they gave David Marks &#34;Getcha Back&#34; to sing.  They could have picked a song he was involved with.  The best thing about this album is the reintroduction of David Marks and the Surf Guitar licks he provided to the recordings and their early live performances.  That sound kind of disappeared over the years, and faded out completely after Carl Wilson's death.  Hear it here for the first time in decades.
B0058SNI9O|4.0|I ordered these shoes to replace another pair that I walked right through.  I like the first pair better, but these are fine.
B001DF68MA|2.0|Although it seems like it would be a great seat, we may never know.  It claims to fit almost any bicycle, but would not fit: my son's 26&#34; worksman, my husband's 700C univega, my husband's commuter bike, my daughter-in-law's adult tricycle, or my own worksman tricycle.  It finally fit an old mountain bike in disrepair.  If the bike is fixed before my grandson outgrows the seat, then I'll let you know if it works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Try it out Love it. My daughter thinks this game is great. Now all I have to do is figure it out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|With the creation of so many weather apps, I find this is still the best by a mile! Always accurate, and has every feature you could ever want in a weather app...and it's free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.I'm at &times;30 and I love when it gets really fast.  When I get the super shoes I'm almost invinsable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really good game because it entertains you and if children play it they won't get influenced on anything such as violence or nightmare addictive games.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors.  The movie had an interesting plot which was very believable.  I will keep it in my video library for a long time.
B000VHPXR2|5.0|Saw this when it came out in a little podunk town.<br />Very hippied-out tome of musicals<br />great sound in the mp3
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only thing I found wrong with this fun app was that there was not enough of it. Can't wait for more.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This is a routine sci-fi movie made to catch a teen's expendable income. The breath of fresh<br />air is the lead actor, Jennifer Lawrence, who was solid in her role as a beleaguered and<br />selfless young woman knowing the odds are against her.<br /><br />You can tell from her work in this film why she is continuing to stand out as an actress. She<br />will do better as she matures. She was the glue holding the film together.<br /><br />I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if able. By the way the film ends it appears they could opt<br />for a trilogy but if I were her agent she would not opt-in. Continue to watch for Jennifer<br />Lawrence because in this movie she shows her chops with room to grow.<br />.<br />.<br />NOTE: Well, Ms. Lawrence had signed a multi-picture deal and while fulfilling that contract is<br />acting in far more appropriately mature films that are getting good reviews.
B000FC13E0|4.0|This book makes you think about technology, human nature and most importantly consequences of making rash decisions. Every person in corporate world should read this.
0451205766|5.0|This is possibly my favorite book of all time. If you liked the movie, obviously the book will be better. :-)
1439102430|3.0|Originally, Reichs's books were fascinating for the detail and inside information of a true forensic pathologist. But now that what seems like 20 books have been produced, never mind the TV series, she's getting like James Patterson: Create the same template and throw in some slightly altered content.<br /><br />The heroine is consistently, personally threatened, as though she's an undercover government agent, not a doctor. Her on again, off again love life is getting to the point where you want to say &#34;try speed dating.&#34; Just because an author has a unique profession and can write well about it doesn't mean that the subject matter is endlessly interesting when it doesn't change. And the predicaments she gets into are reminiscent of a silent movie and the woman inevitably tied to the train tracks. At some point, you root for the train.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging game play creatively and thoughtfully put together to stretch your imagination.  Keeps you on your toes as you make your way through the various .rooms and levels .
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|The story is kind of ridiculous and there isn't much of character development.  This is a poor prequel to the original movie.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was thrilling and mysterious.  There was never a dull moment and you really feel like your apart of the book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game but it doesn't have very many levels I enjoyed playing though.<br />It was a bit tricky at times but I liked that it didn't have cheats. It made me think it through
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging. Can be addicting. Fun. Entertaining. Different. The clues are easy. Don't want to put it down until you have figured out all the clues.
B003NTSBTC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. DiCaprio never fails to amaze me with his acting ability. This is a superbly crafted story that kept me guessing the whole way... I purchased this one!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's a good book and I hope that a lot more people read it. If you're reading it right now make sure you finish. :)
B0034DGPEU|4.0|A story of life as slaves that brings the reader suspense and how secrets kept can affect everyone around them.  The very hard lives that slaves had and the way that their white &#34;masters&#34; used them as property.  The slave families really looked out for each other when they had the chance.  Very good read.
0671449028|5.0|Another wonderful book to read to our grandchild. She reads before bed so this book is just so perfect!  Thank you!
B00CM9JKQM|2.0|What a let down! Maybe I was expecting too much from a suppressed band, or maybe the horrible mixing and mastering as well as the short length has clouded my mind, this release is not at all up to par from what I would expect Wilton, Jackson, and Rockenfield would be a part of. The musicianship is awesome and the songwriting is strong, but overall this totally is sub par for what these guys have done in the past. James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton has really let down these guys with this recording, mixing, and especially who he allowed to do the mastering (Tom Baker). The drums are a bit too high in the mix of most tracks, the guitars are under a bit, but the worst part is the fact that everyone involved in the recording, mixing and mastering allowed Redemption, Vindication, and Don't Look Back to be very distorted and clip out in the mix. \\"Loudness War\\" compression is absurd!. Even with that peaking out in the low end, the low mid to bass frequencies are extremely low. I have to totally flip my eq to get a balanced sound from top to bottom. The Drums totally peak out everything in the opening of Redemption. I've tried it on 3 different systems and even my studio recording headphones and it's the same on all systems. Don't Look Back is the best drumming I've heard from Rockenfield in over a decade, but is marred by the production. Todd La Torre has strong chops, but his diction (pronouncing syllable correctly when singing), particularly in his consonants, is very weak, especially on the faster tempo tunes. I have a very hard time understanding what he's saying. Believe it or not, diction is important even in rock and pop music. This is also possibly a product of the bad mix. Some of the tracks have nice melodic hooks, and the final product beginning to end has an old school QR vibe of a concept album. I wasn't going to mention a comparison of Tate's Frequency Unknown project to this but after all of the negative slam on Tate's product and the praise of this album, I'll have to say FU is a far superior product. Hopefully this band will find a better producer for their next recording as that is the main fault of this 2013 self-titled Queensryche release. I realize Barton is a legendary producer, but this is plain bad. I will however look forward to buying the music in the future from both the Geoff Tate and the QR camps. I don't see Tate being able to keep the QR name after the forthcoming lawsuit. Finally, I give this 2 stars simply because there has never been a release by this band that has sounded so poor in quality, yes even Tate's FU is produced/mastered better.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me so entertained. When I'm bored I go straight to playing it. I have fun using the different characters it has. It's a challenge for me to get all the money and sometimes me and my cousins have a race to see who goes the farthest.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|Never received Jewels Star on my KindleFire.  Maybe it is not for KindleFire.  I don't know, but would like to have something similiar to it.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Rented it and watched it twice. The movie had great special effects and was not a bit boring both times that I watched it.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is really fun, it just ended kind of too early but it's really fun for a hill billy boat game.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Lots of action and not boring at all. Tom Cruises character was funny and at times it almost seemed like a little crazy. Highly recommend the movie.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The Son of Neptune book I thought was done very well. It had a very good story line and was just well writen. Rick Riordan has done it again! It has everybodys favorite character Percy Jackson back once again, but he dosen't remember very much. He just knows his name, he's a demigod, and one name: Annabeth. Percy has another action packed adventure with so new friends, many dangers, and some suprises!!!<br />  I hope the Percy Jackson fans are going to love this book as much as I did. Well hope I helped and I hope you get this book and enjoy it!!!
B004XWLIJS|4.0|Could have had a little better writing or editing. But I suppose that it was a time constraint for the theaters.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I have two other DVDs about Lincoln's life. Daniel Day-Lewis does a plays the part superbly. The content is the best.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Lots of action. Great plot and twist in the story. Some oof the puns and jokes werent really needed in the movie but some were pretty funny
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I started playing it an  within the first 5 minutes I got boat sick and felt like I had to throw up. I tried to find a way to play and not get sick, but it is just to fast.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I have been playing this for about a week now, and I am still hooked. The only thing that is disappointing is the cost of the premium items. However, they still have giveaways and promotions threw Facebook, even though the game is a year old.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the world tour it's relly fun .my favorite part of the world tour is parise because it just so beautiful. I wonder can subway subnets can do Illinois<br />That will be great!?!

B006HGXGWU|5.0|While this superb film came & went without much commercial success, I have no doubt that it'll come to be regarded as a seminal film for this era, which is so permeated with formless fear & dread. The film captures all of that fear & dread in countless aspects: apocalyptic fears, terrorism, insanity, economic collapse, disintegration of the family, drastic climate change, the end of civilization as we know it. Yes, it's about all those things ... and yet it's never ponderous, impressed with its own weight or importance. It's essentially a simple, straightforward story of one man, struggling to hold his life & soul together as nightmarish dreams & visions of doom convince him that he's slipping into the same abyss of mental illness that took his mother.<br /><br />Curtis (a magnificently understated but intense Michael Shannon) is a deeply loving husband & father, working a job that keeps him just a paycheck away from consuming debt. His wife (the glowing Jessica Chastain) sells handmade goods to supplement their income, they have a deaf daughter who needs an expensive operation. Living in tornado country, they're already under threat from the weather, as well as walking a precarious economic tightrope. Curtis is also troubled by the fact that his father ran out on his family when he was young, which makes him all the more determined & desperate to be a good father & husband. But in these times, that's harder & harder for so many working men. In fact, he's lucky to have a job at all, and he knows it.<br /><br />But then he starts having terrible dreams about a strange oily rain, mysterious storms & flocks of birds. In these dreams, loved ones become vicious killers who attack him: his family dog, his best friend, even his beloved wife. And he hears thunder while awake, thunder that nobody else seems to hear. He's approaching the same age his mother was when she developed schizophrenia, and of course he fears that he's inherited whatever genetic flaw it was that destroyed her mind. But by his very nature, desiring to be strong & self-sufficient, he's slow to tell anyone, preferring to check out books on mental illness from his woefully insufficient local library. His doctor recommends an analyst, but Curtis can't afford that; he agrees to see a local counselor, who is caring but clearly overworked & unprepared to cope with his potential problem.<br /><br />Soon he becomes obsessed with repairing & extending the old tornado storm shelter on his property, obviously the way a man who works with his hands tries to retain control of his life, by building something. Yet the dreams are getting worse, and that's starting to affect both his working & home life. Friends & family notice, become uneasy, worried -- all of which makes him even more frightened of what might be happening to him.<br /><br />Finally the crisis comes. What this is, I won't reveal ... but there's more than one crisis here, leading to an ambiguous ending that could be literal, metaphoric, or both. It'll generate a lot of discussion as to its nature. I'll only say that it had to be ambiguous, and doesn't yield to just one \\"correct\\" explanation. If it has any cinematic antecedent, it would be Peter Weir's 1977 classic \\"The Last Wave\\" -- very similar in story, but headed in a very different direction, because it deals with very different cultural material.<br /><br />Meanwhile, if you want an emotionally gripping, thought-provoking film that deals with existential dread in contemporary America, putting fantasies of zombies & sci-fi apocalypse to shame as the childish detritus they are, then this is it. There's no escapist nonsense of Stuff Blowed Up Real Good -- what blows up here is the illusion of security & normality we all need to get through everyday life in increasingly uncertain times. Most urgently recommended!oyed her mind.

But team lava if you are reading this and are looking for NEW UPDATES to make game even better let me help you!!:<br />1) make a &quot;send to all neighbors&quot; button when sending gifts<br />2) get rid of those star things and just give us the star power like you used to automatically ...... other than that great game!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|If you have never had kids, let me just tell you that this movie is spot on. Every kid is different, every dad is different, every mom is different and every pregnancy is different. I loved this movie even though it made me grab the tissue every 10 minutes. I laughed just as often and lost track of the number of times I said, \\"awww!\\" Great movie! Fabulous cast!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I bought the film so that my family and I could watch it. Very enjoyable film with lots of laughs.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I got the app because of the w e a t h e r !!! After I got it the weather disappeared it was good for a while but soon it was not worth it instead I got radar express. Get something else!!!!!!!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I rented the video and watched it to see what it was about. I enjoyed the video and watched it from my laptop.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was thoroughly enjoyable and worth the price of admission. Kept me entertained for hours. Not much replay value, though. Not overly challenging, but engaging.
B00A4B9A1U|4.0|This book contains many startling revelations, though I don't think that it is brilliantly written and it glosses over how World War II began. Its strength is that it shows how little American politicians' attitudes toward the rest of the world have changed since Truman's time in office. The only significant change is that money influences them even more now than it did at the end of World War II. To blame ordinary Americans for the evil and deceitful people that have run their country since 1945 would be naive and wrong; ordinary Americans have been lied to and misled by their politicians for decades just as much as the rest of the world. Their politicians such as the Bushes, Cheney, Rumsfeld, the Clintons, Carter, Reagan, Wolfowitz, Nixon, Johnson, and Obama - yes him too - and their numerous minions who influenced them are basically criminals. Sadly, as this book implies, they will never be charged for their crimes against the human race. The American public will have to suffer up for a long time yet until they get a leader who is brave enough to return the U.S.A. to the status of a great nation that respects human rights.
B000FCK65W|4.0|Very well written in wonderful prose.  A very nice book that you can pick up and put down as you wish, and not feel like you've missed anything.  Reading this book is a little like watching back-to-back-to-back Andy of Mayberry episodes.  The characters are very likeable and well developed the more you watch (read) and you can miss quite a few episodes and come back in and not feel like you missed much.  But, after several dozen episodes, it can get too uneventful to keep your interest.  I didn't see any plot or point of the writing, just &#34;peeking in&#34; on the life of our starlet as she grows up.  The period setting is interesting, but even that gets a bit tedious after a while.<br />If you're looking for a VERY relaxing, mindless, slow summer read, this will be your book.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|From the moment the first bomb goes off, it's nothing but nonstop action after that. Great movie and Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) is incredibly sexy.
0446585025|5.0|My Celina adores Ellen, as well as I.  She does not read well, but so wanted this book.  She read the whole book and loved it!!  &#60;3  Next it's my turn.  :)
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I lived through that historical event so it was nice to see it brought to light in a film. Great acting!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I love how the book is done from Jack's point of view! It was interesting to see things through his eyes.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome way to learn how to play MTG. All the rules and card charcteristics are presented to the player in real time.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|The many examples and case studies included in this book made it very effective at cementing the different concepts and steps covered. I recommend this book for the person who is thinking about starting up lean but still is not sure of where to start.
B000A7DVRC|5.0|This is my husband's favorite movie. He loaned it out twice and I bought a new copy each time. It might be worth buying in bulk its so entertaining.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a great game. I usually don't play a lot of games, but this one is addictive. The action is quick and the levels are difficult, but not impossible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this for my dd and I think she will like it now that she has been to horse camp.
B008602KQI|5.0|Sadly I haven't read the book.  But I can tell you the movie fricken rocks!!  My husband and I really enjoyed it and couldn't get enough of it.  I definitely  recommend it.
B004TI5N38|3.0|This author is always a reasonable reading experience, and this book is no exception.  Well done, although a bit slow to start.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I like this movie. I know its not batman dark knight but the dark knight rises remind me of batman begins.
0307278255|5.0|I don't know how she does it, but Jhumpa Lahiri had me from the first story for wrote in Interpreter of Maladies. Powerful, spot on portrayals of having one foot in two cultures. The final series of stories ends in an emotional, incredible explosion that only Lahiri could navigate without turning maudlin or trite. Brilliant work.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Totally love it. Very fun game. Had it on iPod but now I have it on my kindle! Super fun!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is the best app you can ever download! I really enjoy this app especially because I am a horse rider myself!;) I highly recommend this game.
6305603847|5.0|I got my movie very fast. I was like new at a very low price. I can't stop watching the movie. I wanted this movie for a long time. you are a very good seller on amazon at a very low price & fast. thank you very much shane...
B00AEBBA72|5.0|This take on the old story is very entertaining. Dep is mesmerizing, as usual. The backstory of Crane's mother having been a &#34;child of nature&#34; is especially good. I liked having Crane be a cop rather than a schoolteacher.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was an incredible book. It truly is one of the best books I have ever read. His stunning use of descriptive words is unsurpassed.  The emotional impact for me was almost overwhelming.  While I am often impressed by other authors, it is rare I laugh out loud or cry.  This author made me do both.  I can hardly wait to read his other books.  What a sensitive and poetic writer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book......<br />  was recommended to me and now i want to read other two.  everyone should read this great book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you thinking<br />Every room has new surprises. You really have to think about  some of the rooms. I've had to leave and come back to a couple

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I did not like the way the author separated the last 2 books. The timeline was off and confusing. However, it was still an excellent read and I cannot wait for the next book to come out.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|After some research of various news feeders I tested Feedly. After getting use to its format I soon learned to customize and add content to it. Transferring my subscriptions from my Google reader was painless and complete. I enjoy this Kindle version because it allows me to easily follow news stories to the original source and to easily return to the aggregator, Feedly. To enlarge the text requires only a quick tap or two to the screen. With its new found fame Feedly is now actively making improvements to its product according to some of the Tech sites that I like to visit. With that in mind one can assume that it will also get better over time.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|This is one of the most fun and entertaining movies I have seen.  The special effects are great and it is a beautiful transfer from Amazon.  Wish I could of seen it in 3-D.  I can see where it would of made the experience even better.  It's a must see and the story follows the original (that we all grew up with Jack and the Beanstalk)_ close and yet adds its own touch to make the story more interesting.
B004ODLUF8|4.0|I have a new 3D TV.  This was a good movie but wish I had bought the 3D version.  I guess I thought all Imax movies were<br />3D, but they are not.  This was very educational.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Not at all what I've come to expect from Josh. Would not recommend, despite having ALL of his other albums.  :-(
B00447G29S|5.0|My grandson loves &#34;The Polar Express&#34;  so this was one of the first movies I bought for my new 3D TV.  It was great;  everyone loved it.  Great 3D effects.  I can expect to watch this all year through!!
B005LAIIPS|3.0|I watched this on my birthday. It was a lot of back and forth with the different scenes between different films. It was not boring. It was realistic. Not the best one, but it was not horrible. Filled with a good cast. I hope this doesn't turn into those Halloween movies.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wow!... How far we have come, but in many ways, how far we as society still have to go...humbling...<br />I would recommend this to everyone.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy this movie. Wait until it goes to Redbox if you are curious. I was highly disappointed in the movie. I must say the previews of the movie were better than the movie itself. Some of the preview scenes I did not see in the movie??? I don't understand why it was not good... perhaps the plot ?????
0525478817|1.0|This book was recommended by a good reading friend. I read the whole book, but halfway through I almost abandoned it. I was hoping for an awesome ending to the story since it was so highly recommended, but I was sorely disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to master but endlessly challenging. Great gameplay and the changes of venue keep it fresh. I just can't stop playing.  Wonderful job, Kiloo!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Unlike the first two books, this one offered an interesting story that brought in more characters and a plot to keep me reading.  I had truly found books one and two of this trilogy erotic, but with little else to offer!!!!<br />That said, I did find the first third of the book to be a continuation of the same scenes repeated over and over.  Fortunately, I usually finish whatever I start, and I did not put the book down prematurely.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was a favorite of mine from childhood. It is a joy to see it still available for my children to enjoy!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This isn't the most thought stimulating movie but if you want a time killing scifi action flick then this is for you. I have watched this more times then I should so it has replay qualities. Relax and enjoy it for what it is which is a fun action movie with great visuals that you can watch repeatedly.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|tied up all the loose ends from the first two movies of the trilogy; however, could have expanded the role of the cat burglar (i.e. cat woman)
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|Very imaginative and I found all the stars eventually. Nice game and story, made with Flash. I loved the artwork and the quirkiness.
B000068OCS|4.0|A bit dated for the time frame it was done.  I believe some aspects of life have changed in the intervening years.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I keep going back in forth about how to rate this book. Sometimes I think a 3, then a 4, then a 3.5. I guess I'll just stick with the middle and go 3.5. Here's why:<br /><br />I reread Bared to You right before I started Reflected in You because it had been 3 months since I was last engaged with these characters. Since I had everything refreshed in my mind, I thought I would dive right in and guess what happened? I was left with a regurgitation of Bared to You for several chapters. I mean seriously people, this is a contingent series. Read the first book if you want to know what happened, but don't make the rest of us suffer through endless reiterations. I had a fleeting thought to start skipping chapters, but I sucked it up and kept reading.<br /><br />The story started to move along but I found myself ridiculously frustrated. The back and forth made me want to pull my hair out. It felt like, \\"you hurt me so I hurt you and then you retaliate so I'm gonna hurt you back worse and push the limits until we are forced to have crazy sex and then repeat the cycle again.\\" I don't mind some tension and angst but DAMN. Can we get some storyline here?<br /><br />I know both Eva and Gideon have both been traumatized to the nth degree, so I can allow for some dysfunction while they try to navigate a romantic relationship in the best way that they know how. However, instead of all of the back and forth, I wish that space would have been filled with more detail and storyline. I'm all for steamy scenes, but I honestly think that the sex scenes got in the way this time. They were hot, but I was craving a progression of the storyline because I didn't want to think that I waited months to just read a book of sex scenes. It got so over the top that I started to skip through the sex in order to get to the plot. Band aid sex can only fix so much, and if it has to fix it 10 times a day, it gets really old and you end up looking like a mummy.<br /><br />This is a break down of the book:<br />15% review of what happened in the first book<br />35% sex<br />35% game playing/back and forth/break up to make up (that eventually leads to sex)<br />15% plot (and 10% occurs at the end of the book)<br /><br />One of the things that really got to me was how evasive Gideon was about EVERYTHING - his past, his past relationships, who he went to dinner with the night before, etc. There were times when he could have easily cleared things up with Eva, but he remained elusive, and for what reason? It just led to more fights and more tug of war. As controlling as he was, he thought he could keep meeting up with Corinne and Eva was supposed to be ok with that? I can kind of forgive him in the end for being so evasive because he wanted Eva's reactions to appear genuine to the police, but he could have still threw her bone. Something other than, \\"wait for me\\" or \\"just trust me\\" or \\"just feel me\\". I mean the whole point is that they are both emotionally damaged, in what world would he think that would be enough? Eva's not innocent either. I was pissed when she reconnected with a former fling, and the times she tried to make Gideon jealous infuriated me. Seriously, DO YOU WANT THIS TO END? How many times do you have to do the same thing over and over again before you realize you are just INSANE?<br /><br />There were things that I really liked. After having just reread Bared to You, I felt more involved than the first time I read about their relationship because I had time to distance it from my feelings about Fifty Shades of Grey (which I had read right before I read Bared to You the first time). I could view the story more independently instead of just looking at it as a better written copycat. Since I felt more invested in their relationship, I was able to appreciate their tender moments and closeness better while reading Reflected in You. Even though this book picks right up where the last book left off, the time I had to wait for this book to be released seemed to somehow make me feel like their relationship had been going on longer than it actually had. This was a good thing because it made their 'love at first sight' romance seem more real. I liked that we got to have more one on one time with the Eva and Gideon. I believed in their bond and I have several quotes highlighted in my kindle that I thought were touching and beautiful.<br /><br />The last 10% of the book started moving really quickly. Pieces started to fall into place and I got all excited and worked up and then, I got blue balls. Serious blue balls. I stayed up all night reading this book and by the time I finished it was light outside and I was so pissed I didn't even want to sleep. I don't appreciate being jerked around like that. I would have cut out half of the sex just to learn more about Gideon's past and be able to spend more than five minutes with the characters when they were actually getting along and not playing childish games with each other that drove me mad. Was there not enough material to make this a trilogy? Did we need to cram all of the excitement into the third book and use the 2nd book as a filler?<br /><br />More evidence that when there's a hot trilogy, wait until the whole damn set is available before embarking on the journey. When will I ever learn?<br /><br />Of course I'm going to read the last book. I need some relief. I am intrigued enough to want to know what happens with Brett, Corinne, Magdalene, Christopher Vidal Jr. and the rest of Gideon's family, Dr. Terry Lucas, and of course the much anticipated HEA of Gideon and Eva. After the emotional tornado I just experienced reading this book, there better be a HEA. As frustrated as I may seem, I did enjoy this book and if you were a fan of Bared to You, I would recommend reading it. If you are like me and hate to wait (especially when you feel somewhat unsatisfied), you may want to read this book a bit closer to when the final book of the trilogy is released.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is literally the best game I've ever played. I had so much fun playing it. Me and my daughter played it together and we had a great time. I really thought this game was excellent. Addicting.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I wish I had written a review of Slammed right after I read it. I was so touched by this book, and even cried a few times while reading it. I wish I were witty enough to write my review as a Slam poem.<br /><br />This is the story of two families that have experienced incredible loss, and the sacrifices they have made (and will have to make) to keep a cohesive family unit. I loved the dynamic between Will and Layken, and the way they helped each other cope. I thought their stories, as well as Eddie's story, really emphasized that \\"non-traditional\\" families are just as real, loving and abnormally normal as what society considers family in the \\"traditional\\" sense.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to start Point of Retreat, and would suggest buying both books at the same time, as you'll want to keep the story going. This story was so beautiful and well written. I didn't just fall in love with the main characters; I fell in love with their families and friends too. This is a book I will read again. I'll probably add more to this review later. There are some great lines I want to add.

I would have nothing changed. But I would like the multiplier go up to 100 and not as low as 30. That was my review.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Definitely made me think but it was not too hard.  Looking forward to new levels.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|do don't download it. it was an awful app didn't not help at all. the web Icon is Easier to use.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book does a lot of further character building and creates more bonds between the characters. Tugs at your heart strings and makes you excited to find out what will happen next and how it will all end. The third book was a huge let down though, so you may want to quit after this one and make up your own ending. :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for any age. You will never get bored and it features so many great little tasks and missions. Great graphics and never blurry!!!
1591396190|2.0|I was looking for a book to go deeper into marketing since I do not have formal education in the subject. The examples in this book are good but still shallow even for me. It is easy to make examples of failures and success companies and give them a new label. Ok, you will get some awareness for sure, but if you want to have a real marketing conversation with an experienced marketing individual look for another book with more technical information. Otherwise, what is said here won't hurt you but you will need way more info, this is not even 5% of the info you need to gain actual confidence in the subject. At least that is my point of view.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is kinda creepy cause the guy in the basement that u saw when the lights flickered and in the guestroom the guy in there that's how far I got and the guy scared me so much I turned the game off but other then that it was AWESOME!!!! and I don't blame them for making it kinda scary at some parts

B000GCFY0I|5.0|Well-written. I couldn't put it down. Imagery is amazing & characters have great depth. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
159463176X|5.0|I've read all three of his novels and loved everyone of them.  He just brings you into the life of Afganastan and its people.  Never disappoints.
B00D8RYV52|3.0|I think all the Dr. Panda apps are awesome for my 3 year old daughter. She is OBSESSED with all of them. Although this one is definitely her least favorite. And as a parent, there is very little learning or interactivity with the garage app. Would love to see more features and things to do. So far I would say it's blah.
B008J34466|3.0|Pink can't seem to curb her habit of cursing throughout most of her songs. Although the melodies are good, the lyrics leave a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend this for pre-teens, for sure.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|This book is great for girls who enjoy a bit of romance but aren't to fond of all the guchy stuff.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you want more wonder in your life today, and you'd like to suddenly remember the secret place you used to go when you were nine that was really important to you, and the pet you loved but haven't thought much about since you were a kid, and the magical underpinnings of reality that manifest as kindness and common sense, read this.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|Can't wait for the next one<br />It is a hard concept to understand, but quite interesting<br />Seems far fetched to have all the magic to create things, yet fight with swords
B004SOR4H6|4.0|when ever I want to send a direct message or go to load one it stays on that number that it was on
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved loved loved this book..... has a good love story makes you sad cry and laugh also... different names in the book to.. you can have the ocean I will take the lake...love it...
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I downloaded this app and boy was I surprised by the choices. I use it with the Kindle App and love the categories is has. By the way you don't have to own a Kindle to download the app, I have a Zeki tablet and it works just fine. If you love to read this is the app for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game ever! I have never played such an awesome game before! You have to get it! A couple of months and it will be just like computer edition!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an incredibly useful App. You don't need a kindle to download this. I have a Zeki tablet and I use it all the time. I love horror stories and they have a wonderful selection. It has many others like Romance or History,too.  I'm pretty sure you'll find what you're looking for. They have lots of choices in each category, some are free and others are pretty cheap. Give this a trial run and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. At first i didn't really like it and was like im not going to like this game at all but then i kept playing and now i love it. I play it everyday. I unlocked Tricky so far
159463176X|5.0|I read his previous books (The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns - cried reading that one!) and I think this last one may be his best.<br />It is a great read into the Afghanistan we DON'T see on the news, the one that people live in day in and day out, where the lines of what we know to be right are very blurred.
0634014331|4.0|pretty broad coverage that is a great way to get started with the B3 and save the time of exploring
B000025Y9I|4.0|I bought this CD just to get &#34;Texas,&#34; which I really like. There are some other interesting songs on this CD, but in all honesty I don't play them nearly as much as I play &#34;Texas.&#34;  The imagery Rea invokes in that song, combined with the instrumental parts, is just outstanding.  Although as someone else pointed out, it is a bit odd to listen to a song about a strictly American locale, Texas, and hear Rea refer to someone as being &#34;several meters high.&#34;  Don't analyze the lyrics too much, just go with the groove and get yourself some Texas.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great read.  I couldn't put it down.  He writes with such clarity!  I was hooked at the first chapter. Great insights into another great culture.

B007SGM084|5.0|If only there were real Christian Greys out there to satisfy us nonfiction women who are deserving of such lascivious love and affection! I enjoyed the sex parts as much as the next gal (C'mon, we all knew this was freaking erotica before picking up the book!), but the main reason I succumbed to the desire in the pages of this book was Christian. His baggage and Ana's awkwardness were primary to their story and I am a freaking sucker for hearts and flowers and dark desires. It would not surprise me at all if some of the women that deprecate this book in their reviews do so out of denial of their own suppressed, carnal concupiscence. In fact, it would make my eyes roll!  In a still, relatively, conservative society there are those who abhor what they fear and refuse to relish in fantasy. Which, is what this entire trilogy is: fantasy!<br /><br />So, if you blatantly (or secretly) take pleasure in fantasy, read these books. They are interesting and well written for the average-slightly above average reader. I will openly admit that I did have to use the dictionary feature in the Kindle reader for some of the words, but, for me that is part of enjoying a book: taking more from it than what I had before. Books should help expand your imagination, attention and vocabulary at the very least! There are definitely parts of the book which I felt were repetitive, but, really I was too enthralled by the story to notice ... until I came across other reviewers' stinging recounts of how much they disliked this or that citing various reasons from technical things like repetition of situations, lack of variety, inconsistency of characterization, lack of realism and just plain criticism toward the books. Oh, my! (Biting my lower lip)<br /><br />Essentially, if you're an uptight control freak, you will relate to one character; on the converse, if you're a shrewd innocent who enjoys a little excitement you will definitely relate to another character. This book may help you discover hidden pining you never knew existed latent within you!<br /><br />If you are not interested in any way in erotica, this may not be the best place for you to start as there is a lot of sex. A lot. Of sex. Hot, vulgar, libidinous words for miles. So, if that makes you uncomfortable in a bad way, but you're still tingly for a little dirty reading, start with a Danielle Steel and work your way up from there, see if you really want to delve into erotica some more, maybe it's just not for you. But, if you're sated by lusty youth and a luscious storyline, jump right into the Red Room of Pain and kneel before E.L. James' intriguing characters and their torrid lovemaking in myriad situations, places and surfaces! I identify with the latter group. Voraciously.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helps you decide on your O face or your Oh, My! face };-)dden pining you never knew existed latent within you!<br /><br />If you are not interested in any way in erotica, this may not be the best place for you to start as there is a lot of sex.

B00AHRWBH6|5.0|All the things that the pop culture book &#34;The Secret&#34; was not.<br />Read this carefully constructed, and thoughtfully written book that explains how to direct your life down the path you choose to go.<br />Find out how to take control of your circumstances and be what, who, and where you want to be in life. See how shallow and pale &#34;The Secret&#34; is, compared to this original work by Charles Hannel.

0547884591|5.0|Liked how it teaches how to learn on any subject.  Easy to follow & understand. Haven't tried any of the cooking yet, but has been a great book without even cooking.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I've always loved this movie- a lot of people will complain, but, when don't they? For me, it's the story; young love, on a whim and at times how we do what we can for one another, even in disaster. Sacrifice is made and tragedy happens, but those who are important will linger with us. Great movie and glad I found it here! All stores in my area were charging double the price!
B0012GN47C|4.0|This is addition to many other Santana albums and he is always great to listen to. Well recorded with a good group of guys behind him.

B008QE9XD2|4.0|This moving was pretty good.  If anyone was around when the orginal Dark Shadows soap opera will enjoy this movie.  I great find.  Yes I am old enough to remember runing home from school just to watch Dark Shadows.  My kids now into their 30's liked the movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I first got this via a free app of the day. And boy what an free app this is! The wonderful &#34;next word prediction&#34; is definitely something that spoils you! Sure others have come along to add this feature but they never work quite as well as Swiftkey. It's a must have app for me.<br /><br />They added the flow swiping to type. It was a feature I felt could have propelled this app to be the best keyboard out there. It is very good but can't compare it to Swype or Google's gesture type as I have not had enough experience with each to claim Swiftkey's is thee &#34;best&#34; at swipe typing. It is very good with the added feature of &#34;flowing&#34; to the space bar, which gives you the ability to type entire sentences without even lifting your finger!<br /><br />With or without the flow option, Swiftkey is hands down my favorite keyboard app. I have converted many friends into purchasing this app and they love it!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I remember being at the concert in Las Vegas.  It was a great night.  Now with only 2 remaining members it is also a great concert dvd.  I've always loved the Bee Gees.  I was not a fan of Disco but many people don't hear their songs before disco started and after disco ended.  I know I'm old enough to remember the Bee Gees before the 70's.  Great DVD if you want to hear a great DVD.
B005K17RU0|5.0|With a tap of my finger I can see what the day will be like......Easy to add a location and view different forecasts.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Rather fun little app. The games requires a lot of gold to move forward quickly, so it takes a while if you don't buy gold. Otherwise entertaining.
B00CHILW64|1.0|Garbage. Had to turn it off because of the constant pauses.  My internet speed is fine. My internet connection to the player was fine.  This movie just wouldn't play right. It sucked.  We watched something else.  I need my money back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game allows the whole family to use their brains and their imagination. Looking to own more. Great way to keep everyone active in the mind
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Being that I hate to return things and returning something from online is even worse, I was scared because there are a lot of reviews that say their discs were scratched or that the quality looked like bootlegged or &#34;copied&#34; cd's.  Mine arrived in perfect condition.  We just finished the last disc of season 6 and not one of them had a scratch or any problems whatsoever.  I'm happy I bought it.  Great show, too!
B00942G4UA|3.0|The documentary was great but the video was not so clear. It was from time to time blurry. Overall great and very intuitive.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Picked it up again for a vacation read, motivated by the ad for the fourth book. Forgot what a great story it was.
0375851569|5.0|Individually, these wonderful characters have taught countless thousands of young minds  the joy of reading.  Putting them all together seems the next logical step.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've read some of the negative reviews about this book, including several that say they hated the ending.  Let me just say that I firmly believe that the ending can make or break a book.  The ending of this book was perfect; it left me thinking about all that had gone before it and turning the characters over in my head for days after.  It didn't tie everything up in a nice little bow, but it fit the rest of the story in ways a more conventional ending would not have.<br /><br />As for those who say the plot is unrealistic, they're not completely wrong.  And thank goodness. If I ran into these characters in real life, I would run the other way as fast as I could.  But there are just enough crazy people out there in the world to convince me that these people might be real, somewhere, just thankfully not in my life.  I enjoyed the writing and the plot twists and the character development enough to overlook the craziness and enjoy the ride.  I'm sure I'll read it again, but nothing will ever beat that first read-through.
B00821OX98|5.0|Truly enjoyable and creative and not like any other made for TV series.  Finish one episode and you can't wait to see what happens next.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|From beginning to end this album sounds like the classic Sabbath from their first four to five records.  Obviously they were going for that sound, it does feel at times contrived but still, it has all of the elements that you loved about the band to begin with.  If you like Black Sabbath's early recordings, you will like this.  The mixing is great too and the sound levels are perfect.  Lastly, one standout is Damaged Soul. Unbelievable.
0471702188|5.0|My preference for a text on Valuation other than:<br /><br />On Progressive Communist Finance: Asset Syndication & Empire Building<br />By Michael Herlache MBA
B006BXTOFC|4.0|This album just rocks.  No week spots, all top-notch, and each song has it's own unique groove.  When you play this album, time goes by seemingly faster, and when the last song finishes, you want more.  That is what a good record is supposed to do.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app is great because I can use my tablet for Facebook and have all the same features as if I were on my desktop computer. It is nice to be able to take it everywhere with me and check in on my new kindle.
0425252868|5.0|For many years I had heard this story and always thought it was some warm, fuzzy, feel good, nonsense from what was really a very brutal time. I figured at least it was exaggerated and distorted to make a Disney movie out of it. I can't tell you how pleased I was to read this well written book with all the true facts sorted out. Truth is stranger than fiction and it turns out this wonderful story is true and inspiring and shows that World War II was not as black and white as many people think it was.<br /><br />The book is filled with little nuggets of gold of first hand accounts that seem impossible to imagine in the present time. Like a bear mascot drinking beer and hanging out at the Berlin public swimming pool...love it! So many little glimpses of everyday life on the German and US side are present in the book that it was an absolute treat for a hardcore reader of WWII lore like myself. I have spent over 50 years reading this stuff and this book is new and refreshing.<br /><br />Let's hope someone does make a realistic movie about these men's lives and does not turn it into a fantasy. Did I mentioned how much I loved the book? I love it! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I ever played my whole family played it it is very fun to play
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app may be a free alarm clock, but it's not like others. This alarm has different settings to help wake you such as doing math problems of different difficulties to the selection of an alarm that you can get music from you device on the kindle, not just your cloud. I will highly recommend this to anyone who needs it. Don't go to the store and buy a 10 dollar alarm, that always crashes when the power goes out, get it on you hundreds of dollars device.

B0026PW67W|1.0|Honestly, if you buy this for what they are selling it for, they are taking you to the cleaners. I have the exact same map that came with a much larger collection of items, that was a few bucks cheaper.<br /><br />While the map is a nice addition to the other items I purchased [in a single package], I'd be extremely disappointed if I bought this single item alone.<br /><br />It's thick and sturdy, but smaller than I'd expected. It has an old world look to it but it's not very easy to read. The ink is blotchy, much of it is in Latin...<br /><br />I really think your money could best be spent elsewhere. I read a few of the 1 star reviews before purchasing which led me to my other purchase decision of [[ASIN:0062215507 Harry Potter Film Wizardry (Revised and Expanded)]]. However, if it's ALL you want, then you're probably not going to find a better Marauder's Map. If you do, let me know. ;]

B004X6PRO6|4.0|THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON creates a world as unaccountable as it is scary. Reading Adam Johnson's book made me wonder just how do the people of North Korea remain human. Jun Do thrives in his homeland of despotism and disappointment. The optimal survival skill is ennui and numbness. His story is vividly constructed to juxtapose that extreme possibility, the value of living against the relief of just dying and resting for the first time. It might be easy to believe the plot but mostly because the world knows so little of North Korea. The more I read the greater my appreciation for the US. Yet, the themes required me to look deeper into my personal ignorance about the People's Republic. I've heard people here denounce and curse communism and communist. Once I even asked a person if they knew any communist and they accused me of being unAmerican. Johnson's novel exposes the dangers of nationalism, which I believe we have a lot of here. Living in the US as an immigrant I find it increasingly difficult to encounter optimism.  Ga helps us understand that our laws don't give us order, and our government doesn't make us free, but our blind  faith in it will make it easier for our rights to disappear. Nevertheless, THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON still prefers innocence and passion over paranoid fear. Adam Johnson reminds us that happiness is worthy of our ambitions and it is not complicated. His characters morph to the world of the Leader, but they know when they are not happy and that drives their enlightenment. Read this Orwellian novel to help you see that life really is that simple and freedom really is that natural. I don't know if we will learn more about North Korea, but we certainly will learn more about ourselves.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|It's hard to remake Superman these days. Batman taps into the deep psyche of vigilantism that has always haunted America, but Superman has come to embody a 1950s-style ideal of innocence  that many feel no longer applies in a cynical modern world.  Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer came up with a simple solution. Just show Superman the way we would see him today.<br /><br />And the reality of \\"Man of Steel\\" is that Superman is terrifying.  He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and he lives among us.  He is, in essence, the ultimate terrorist.  Is it any wonder America doesn't accept him at first?<br /><br />With that perspective in mind, \\"Man of Steel\\" does what other superhero movies have failed to do (I'm looking at you, \\"Green Lantern\\"), and that's present a superhero in a realistic fashion.  Kal-El AKA Superman AKA Clark Kent (Heny Cavill) is literally Krypton's last hope, but he's also a wanderer, a cipher, and yes a hero.  Sprinkled throughout \\"Man of Steel\\" is flashbacks to the difficulty of growing up as an alien pretending to be a human, shepherded by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner) Kent. Both of Superman's father figures haunt him figuratively and literally to shape who Superman was, is, and will be. It's compelling stuff.<br /><br />But this is a Superman movie, not a Batman movie, so the potential for world-shaking destruction is never far away. In fact, the level of destruction reaches uncomfortable levels -- those of us affected by 9/11 will find those wounds reopened in the face of superheroes blithely ignoring the massive casualties around them.  It's all filmed with a shaky-cam (tinged by the occasional faux lens flare), demonstrating just what Superman would look like exceeding the speed of sound.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" takes the Superman story and makes logical connections. Lois Lane (plucky Amy Adams) is the logical person to track down the alien -- not because of her sassy attitude but because she's a good reporter tracking down a lead.  Superman doesn't just decide to put on a cape -- he wears a mantle of leadership he willingly embraces. And when Superman comes face-to-face with Zod (Michael Shannon), he's staring down the regimented hierarchy of his past.<br /><br />Goyer and Nolan have pulled of a believable Superman by making him a scary possibility to face.  And yet Superman is woefully unprepared for his role as world savior -- as Zod is fond of pointing out, he's just a farm boy -- or is he? Superman's reintroduced to the DC film universe leaves Metropolis and Smallville irrevocably changed.  And if the other movies planned in the shared universe are any indication, hopefully for the better.n a lead.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My dog ate my last mouse, a Logitech G400 gaming mouse, which was terrific for me.  I thought I'd try this one for about 30 bucks.  This mouse looks pretty cool with its lights.  It's a little too big for my hands, and with the way I hold it I always mistakenly click the closest thumb button on the side, which takes me back a page on the web browser.  This was so annoying I disabled that button and remapped it to the other two.  Also, when I use any mouse I tend to occasionally pick it up slightly by pinching it between my thumb and pinky, but in this case the rubber grips on the sides do provide enough friction to pick up the mouse and it just slips.  If you don't use a mouse in this manner and keep it in contact with the mouse pad at all times, this would not be an issue.  It just was another annoying feature for me.  Other than that, the mouse works fine.  The take home message for me, however, was if you find a mouse you really like (the Logitech G400 for me), don't stray from it.  The mouse is the computer component that you have the most direct contact with day after day (besides the keyboard but for some reason I don't care about that as much), so don't compromise on it.<br /><br />Update 7/5/13:  I think my original review may come across as more negative than I intended.  Yes, there are a few features that I didn't like, but that may just be personal preference.  As the other reviews here suggest, many people have no problems with this mouse and love it.  And in truth, this mouse is actually growing on me, as I'm gradually learning how to handle it.  I'm increasing my rating mainly because of the excellent customer service Anker has provided.  They've been very responsive to my (hopefully constructive) criticisms, in what is probably one of the best customer service experiences I've had, no exaggeration.  I wish all companies are like this!  Because of this, I will continue to consider Anker products in the future.

B00CM9JKXU|4.0|Just as the title says, this is a very good album if you aren't expecting Queensryche at their peak (Mindcrime/Empire). Let's face it, Geoff Tate and Chris DeGarmo are gone so 40% of what was the Queensryche sound has been removed. If we face the truth about any band they have 2-3 albums that are great if lucky and typically they drop off late in their careers as they mature and the popular sound of the industry changes around them (for example Metallica). The members that remain in Queensryche are not the 20-something, long haired, eye-liner wearin' rockers of the mid-late 80s/early 90s as we are not the same people that we were then. Listen to Dedicated to Chaos (an album that these guys had little to no input) and tell me that this album isn't an improvement. The last songs that even remotely reminded me of the real Queensryche were possibly Sacred Ground from Q2K or maybe Great Divide from Tribe, but most of their recent albums have been big departures from their usual sound (harmonized leads, dueling solos, melodic choruses and soaring vocals). Neither Queensryche nor any other band will ever recreate \\"the glory days\\" again, but that doesn't mean they aren't making good music because it doesn't sound like Mindcrime or Empire.<br />  Back on this album are the harmonized leads, melodic choruses and soaring vocals; the solos aren't as good, but DeGarmo is still off flying planes for a living and the reality is that he always was a better lead guitarist than Michael Wilton (no offense to Whip). Todd LaTorre is not Geoff Tate in his prime, but who is? Todd does an awesome job sounding enough like Geoff to not be a shocking departure from their sound while being himself and adding some of his own style. Scott Rockenfield pours it on when needed to drive some songs, but lays back and doesn't over-power the tune in other instances; all in all he gets to be himself again not trying to mold his playing to badly written songs. Eddie Jackson is as he always has been, theconsumate pro laying down the bass like a champ. My exposure to Parker Lundgren as a guitarist is limited at best, but he is the principle songwriter on Where Dreams Go To Die and I think that song sounds about as much as old Queensryche as any of them so I think he understand the Queensryche sound which sets them apart from other bands in their genre. Let's face it, this is a band with 3 industry veterans and 2 guys who are just getting their feet wet and they will need time to gel together and develop their chemistry as writers and performers over time. What they have accomplished on this album in the short time that they have been all been together as a complete band performing and writing music is a pretty amazing feat. In conclusion, Queensryche's best music may be behind them, but that doesn't mean they can't bring is good music now and into the future.

B006N0YWGY|4.0|I got this game as the faotd, and thinking it would be a not so good game, I decided to play it a couple of minutes as a test and I have to say that it is addicting. Four stars because I would very much have expected something more. Like the ability to upgrade your vehicle or change your character or something. Otherwise, a very good, recommendable game.

B005MLOOJA|5.0|The Good Wife's return season was even more engaging than the first.  Delving into the emotional issues of each character gave them more depth and Julianna Marguilles once again had a chance to shine.  The episodes continued to build on the tension between past mistakes and present happiness and showed the difficulty a family has in overcoming the emotional pain of extramarital affairs. The court room drama coupled with the shows theme of the ever-faithful, yet conflicted &#34;good&#34; wife was tastefully balanced. The seasons added political emphasis and the unveiling history of characters such as Kalinda made the building drama impossible to resist watching.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|I'm a decade behind but reading Moneyball by Michael Lewis almost makes me want to go back following baseball...almost. It is the antithesis in some ways of Costa's Fair Ball but in others I'd say the two are companion pieces.<br /><br />It is a great example of applying market analysis. A lot of start-ups and small businesses in any industry should read this. When you don't have money, you look where there are inefficiencies and value that no else sees that you can exploit. As a small business owner for the last 17 years, I can appreciate it.<br /><br />Sounds easy but at this book shows, old, un-scrutinized logic/way may gives way to new knowledge it is resisted by the old guard at every step.<br /><br />Billy Beane in a recent 2013 article said he was tired of being asked about the book as most people didn't get the point of it. They thought it was about the team, which I question if those people ever read the book at all or were a old baseball scout. Billy Beane makes this old Royal's fan want to cheer for the A's.<br /><br />Beyond that, this is a well written narrative of the A's 2002 season with back story. It brought back memories of playing baseball myself as a kid ad following it up to the 94-95 strike. I love this kind of story telling so this book was hard to put down. The breakdown of at-bats, players' development, drafts, etc. was enthralling. This was my first Michael Lewis book (seen Blind Side) and I'm impressed. I've already added few of his other books to my reading lists.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game has given me hours of entertainment. It has a humorous charm to it along with cleverly set up levels and a demand for strategic thought, which sets it apart from other games in its genre. World of Goo is the farthest thing from repetitive as every level demands a different method of goo-connecting which is why I keep playing, knowing that the next level or chapter will be be something totally different and even more fun than the last. My only gripe with the game is how a small mistake can ruin your entire structure, and in levels without time bugs, this can ruin the whole level, causing you to restart. But I guess this setback is good in the way that it has me building goo structures a lot more carefully than I would if mistakes didn't have consequences; this provides more of a challenge. Still, more time bugs would be nice. Overall, World of Goo is one of my favorite mobile games and it's the first thing I go to when I need to occupy myself on the go.
B006FE17Q6|4.0|I'm not at all a fan of Night of the Living Dead, 28 Weeks Later or any other zombie movie.  It took me several seasons to finally give this show a chance and I've been binge viewing for the last 2 weeks!  Admittedly, it took me the first two episodes to get used to seeing the \\"walkers\\" but once I got passed that, I've been rewarded episode after episode with a show that challenges your view of this world.  At the core of the program is a reflection of what we experience every day - hope, compassion, fear, conviction, revenge, love.  Strip the world of all it's conveniences and see what's left of humanity. I just watched episode 7 of Season 2 \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\".  That episode is what got me to write this review. I'm still processing the last 10 minutes of that episode.  This show is so well done from the casting, setting, makeup. It delivers on so many levels.  I'm just sorry I didn't start watching it sooner!

0062101897|5.0|This book has so much more information about the filming process than &#34;Harry Potter Film Wizardry,&#34; but I was disappointed that the pages are not as beautifully designed. Paying this much for a full-color book that has black text on a white/off-white background in a lot of places seems like a waste. The full-color images are beautiful, and you will spend hours reading the information and looking over the images.<br /><br />The book is large and heavy, so reading it is a bit difficult -- you can't hold this one up for long! By the time I had finished the entire thing, the gold lettering on the spine had worn off from being handled.

1932100660|5.0|Dr. Colin Campbell describes a nutritional experiment titled \\"The China Study\\" and its astounding findings. Stated simply, a Western diet rich in animal protein, is responsible for a majority of diseases of affluence like heart attack, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, multiple sclerosis etc. He thus recommends a plant based whole food to lead a healthy life. I read about several theories and dieting strategies in the past. Most famous being the low carb diet by Atkins. This book does contradict Atkins to an extent because Atkins focuses largely on carbohydrates as the villain and glorifies protein. This book does not glorify any particular nutrient. Except to state that protein should come from plants, not animals.<br /><br />The China Study was a very extensive study to determine the relationship between diseases and diet of selected counties in different parts of China. Conducted sometime in the 1970s and 1980s, and funded by US and China,  it proved that a plant based whole diet is responsible for leading a healthy life. And that animal based diet is responsible for a host of diseases. Dr. Campbell emphasizes on plant based whole food, not vegetarianism which can involve fried foods like McDonald's French Fries. There are no doubts that French Fries are bad for health. The China Study is as famous as the Framingham heart study which was conducted in 1948 and which established the concept of related risk factors such as cholesterol, blood pressure, physical activity, cigarette smoking and obesity.<br /><br />At a fundamental level, there are 3 macro nutrients-namely fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Most of our food consists largely of these 3 constituents. And trace quantities of micronutrients like vitamins. Earlier studies vilified fats. But then we found that there are good fats like unsaturated fats and bad ones like saturated and trans fats. Then carbohydrates were vilified. But then we found that there are good ones like fiber and bad ones like refined sugar. Now it is the turn of proteins. We find that there are good proteins and bad proteins.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell is very knowledgeable in the field of nutrition, he is not a medical practitioner. An accomplished researcher, not affiliated to any of the industries or business interests, he makes his case for making diet as part of medical recommendations for treating diseases. That is something which the medical community is not ready to do. Presumably because of its cozy relationship with the drug industry. Drug companies want their pills to be the sole part of any treatment. Just recommending plant based food does not make any money for the existing industry or medical practices. Cure is a more lucrative business than prevention.<br /><br />Faulty genes do have a role to play in the diseases. Dr. Campbell says that unless there is a trigger, the genes do not express themselves. No harm done without the expression. And that trigger is the animal protein. He also says that dietary supplements are not a good source of nutrients. Certainly not as good as the natural foods.<br /><br />Milk is a surprising villain in his study. And it is a staple diet for vegetarians all over. Dr. Campbell says that it contains an animal protein called Cassein. He himself being a dairy farmer, shifted to a plant based diet without any dairy products, more than a  decade ago, and leads a very active and healthy life. His family has followed suit. By the same token, mother's milk is supposed to be very healthy and safe for babies.<br /><br />Going against the grain and condemning the western diet, he ran up against stiff opposition. Entrenched business interests of dairy, poultry, pharma, and meat industry and status quo demanding medical community.<br /><br />I am impressed with his academic and research credentials and the manner in which he makes his case in a straightforward and honest manner. The book does not contain any recipes, just the nutrition concepts. The book was clearly an eyeopener ! It is certainly one of the best nutrition books I ever read.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django Unchained totally blew me away with its audacity, boldness, and complete dedication to its underlying themes. Slavery was a dirty, dirty business, and just as Speilberg so bravely showed the evil men do in Schindler's List, Tarantino pulls no punches in his brutal bloody opus. That Django (beautifully played by Jamie Foxx) risked life and liberty to save his lady love (the gorgeous Kerry Washington), slaying dragon after dragon, was a tribute to the kind of black man we don't see much of in current cinema. Tarantino outdid himself and his Best Original Screenplay Oscar was well deserved. This is truly a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Django is my new favorite Superhero!

B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|I decided to catch up with the latest tech and upgrade from an 8 year old dell model which frankly got so useless over time that I've hardly used it in the last 5 years. Beginning as a noob to all things pc related I did my research and watched some YouTube vids on building a dedicated high end pc (newegg has an excellent three part tutorial for any you noobs wanting to test the water). Asus was a brand recommended to me by a friend for their quality mobos. Having heard about the imminent release of Intel's new Haswell processors I decided to wait a couple more weeks before taking the plunge all the while doing more research by the end of which I was all raring to go and picked up this little bad boy on release day. I'm glad I waited, moving on...<br /><br />Features and connectivity - where do I begin, there's just so much of it. The good thing is it doesn't feel cramped inside a Fractal Design R4 case and all the ports are located in convenient places so as to keep cable management neat and tidy. This of course helps with airflow within the case and is visually appealing for any aspiring tech geek. There are plenty of 'pro' reviews out there on this so I won't bore you with what's already been covered like specs and functionality, the information is all readily available. I will however briefly cover some of its attributes that really surprised me and made me feel it was money well spent.<br /><br />Overclocking - Asus makes it easy. Ok it probably won't suit some of you veterans of the pc world who will prefer to go beyond and manually over clock (which of course is covered by this board in its UEFI Bios) but for us beginners it was as simple as flicking a switch. The TPU switch on the mobo has three settings, off, 1 and 2. At the default setting (off) it runs the processor at its stock speed (3.5ghz Intel I7). I switched it to 1, turned the pc on and by god, the speed jumped up to around 4ghz. Then using the excellent user friendly Asus AI suite software (more on this later) I was able to up the performance to 4.4ghz simply by pressing a few buttons using its 4-way optimisation feature, it's all automated and more importantly safe so I know I can't damage anything.<br /><br />Asus AI Suite software - Asus makes it easy. This software is multifaceted and you could use it to not only further tweak your overclocking settings but a host of other clever things like monitor system performance and stability, temperature, fan control and a lot more I have yet to discover or use. You could even set it so it charges your usb powered mobile device whilst the pc is off, not only does it work with my iPhone but also the power hungry iPad. Superb I thought as it saves me buying yet another overpriced charger from Apple.<br /><br />Asus UEFI Bios - Asus makes it easy. I must admit a lot of this stuff is cryptic to me (must be heaven for all you tweakers) so I won't go into it too much but I was easily able to navigate myself around to set XMP feature for overclocking RAM to the manufacturer recommended speed. Again this was done simply by pressing a couple of buttons on the keyboard and the mobo took care of all the rest. I know I could get more out of my sexy looking Corsair RAM (did I just say that?) by manually overclocking but I'll save that for a time when I know what I'm doing. In the meantime 1866mhz is plenty I should think. The user interface looks and operates more like a Windows programme than what I would normally associate with a BIOS. Very neat.<br /><br />Wifi & Bluetooth - The wifi reception is perfect, I am comfortably reaching 60mb download and 20mb upload speeds, near the limits of my broadband package and in a room that usually has average reception from the router. The wifi adaptor is really quite slick with a built in magnet so it sticks firm on the metal case and I can quite easily move it around. There seems to be an issue however when using Bluetooth (e.g. Playing back music from my phone) which my techy friend tells me is due to interference caused by the strong wifi signal. I have no idea how or if this can be resolved but since I hardly ever use Bluetooth with my pc it certainly isn't in my list of priorities.<br /><br />Audio quality - This is an area that I'm actually quite comfortable with for a change here. If you had asked me if pc audio can be taken seriously about a couple months ago I would have stuck my nose up and said categorically 'no'. Having heard it on many occasions on different PCs and on different audio systems it was, as far as I was concerned, a noisy and dirty place: switching power supplies, poor noise floor and a bunch of other audio gremlins that leapt out of the built in sound card and associated circuitry to cause a disastrous audio experience. The usual mantra amongst the audiophile community to bypass this issue is to recommend an external DAC at the least connected via USB (ideally Asynchronous). Well it looks like I'll have to eat my own hat, the sound from the built in sound card is refreshingly pure with no obvious audible artefacts, I even brought up my stereo DAC from the main system downstairs just to do a comparison and hooked it up via Asynchronous USB using J River media centre and bit-perfect output. Now at this point some audiophile may suggest well it might be the limitation of your pc speakers (corsair SP2500) being able to resolve any difference. Maybe. But I also hooked it up to my Sennheiser HD650 headphones and could hardly tell any difference, granted the stereo DAC rolled off the treble a bit and there was a tiny bit more oomph in the bass but that's because it was tuned and setup to sound like that. So sound quality wise, I can't complain, this mobo has far exceeded my expectations. In fact it has done more than that, it has changed in me a long held view about audio output from PCs in general. It seems the PC world certainly has progressed in leaps and bounds over the years.<br /><br />So in conclusion, the Deluxe motherboard is just vast in terms of features and connectivity, the components and general standard of build is of a high standard. To support the hardware it has excellent user friendly BIOS and software which it seems Asus has spent many man hours in designing and tweaking. I know its only a matter of opinion but I think it looks very nice with the gold coloured highlights on a black background. It has a lot of neat features and the flexibility to keep me going for a long time, all for just £220 which I think really is a bargain.

The proliferation of this relatively recent phenomenon, as the author explains, has apparently meant that practitioners dealing with REMO procedures -- reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders -- have hitherto had very little published material to turn to for guidance on this difficult subject.  This excellent work of reference from Jordans Family Law series, however seeks to rectify this situation and amply succeeds.<br /><br />`There is an obvious need for a practical guide for those lawyers who must traverse this difficult terrain,' says Thorpe LJ writing in the foreword, adding emphatically that `this title delivers just that....'<br /><br />Practitioners and legal advisors recognizing the need to acquire an enhanced understanding of the various rules and regulation pertaining to matters of jurisdiction and reciprocal enforcement in this area will particularly appreciate this book and the straightforward guidance it provides, to the relevant law and procedures.<br /><br />Co-author Melanie Barnes expresses the hope that this book will be `a useful guide and reference for those who need to deal with practice and procedure in maintenance cases in all tiers of court' - and so it is.<br /><br />Among a wealth of other matters, the book provides an overview of all available applications under domestic law, plus procedural guides and an analysis of international law, which includes the EU Council Maintenance Regulation 4/2009 and the implementation of the 2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other forms of Family Maintenance.<br /><br />If you are a practitioner in this area, one glance through the detailed table of contents will assure you that every relevant issue is covered, from EU regulations and conventions, to financial remedies under the Children Act 1989, to marriage, divorce and dissolution to financial provision upon death -- and more besides, including chapters on commonwealth and former commonwealth countries and the UN and Hague Convention.<br /><br />Featured prominently in the book are the three appendices which include procedural guides pertaining to, for example, maintenance orders and applications plus all the relevant legislation and forms.  And for those doing further research, there are tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and the table of EU and international legislation.<br /><br />Clearly written and logically organised, the book has been intended, say the authors, as `a guide to serve as a useful point of reference for practitioners taking their first steps through the labyrinthine rules of maintenance law'.  Whether based in the UK, or in another jurisdiction, any practitioner advising clients in this difficult area of family law should acquire this book.  The publication date is stated as at 1 February 2013.gh the detailed table of contents will assure you that every relevant issue is covered, from EU regulations and conventions, to financial remedies under the Children Act 1989, to marriage, divorce and dissolution to financial provision upon death -- and more besides, including chapters on commonwealth and former commonwealth countries and the UN and Hague Convention.<br /><br />Featured prominently in the book are the three appendices which include procedural guides pertaining to, for example, maintenance orders and applications plus all the relevant legislation and forms.

1846616026|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3TWLTF9FF15GH]]ON MENTAL HEALTH TRIBUNALS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Published by Jordans, this book offers serious and scholarly examination and commentary about serious and sensitive matters pertaining to mental health tribunals.  Now in its second edition, it has become highly regarded as an authoritative work of reference in one convenient volume and therefore ideal, either for those appearing before the tribunal and their advisors, or for members of the tribunal themselves.<br /><br />The purpose of a mental health tribunal is fundamentally to determine whether an individual should, or should not, be detained under the Mental Health Act (MHA 1983). As author Jonathan Butler points out, the tribunal was `in part a product of the ECHR, frequently referred to as the European Convention on Human Rights.  While such tribunals had mainly advisory powers, the MHA 1983 gave rise to a tribunal `able to deal with the needs of a patient in a more extensive manner'.<br /><br />In the words of the author's colleague, Kris Gledhill, quoted in the preface, `the law relating to detention on the basis of mental disorder and the tribunal at the centre of applications for release should be settled and certain, given that it involves deprivation of liberty and a vulnerable population, two factors that make it important that it be clear.'  Clarity and usefulness to all who participate in a tribunal is therefore the main aim of this book.<br /><br />The book features detailed commentary and explanation of the organization, procedure and jurisdiction of the tribunal in Parts A and B, with the focus on both non-offender patients in Part C and offender patients in Part D.

1908407336|5.0|OF EXTRADITION LAW FOR THE PRACTITIONER<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Extradition law is often misunderstood by the practitioner who may have a rather sketchy overview of the subject and the new processes.  To the rescue comes \\"Extradition Law\\" by solicitors Edward Grange and Rebecca Niblock which sets out how the procedures operate with great clarity.<br /><br />The Legal Action Group has excelled itself with this new title because it covers one specialist area of law which is gaining much greater prominence today, namely the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).<br /><br />The book begins with a useful series of commentaries in 12 detailed chapters.  The remainder of the book has 7 highly practical appendices covering the following areas: framework decision on the EAW; relevant sections of the Extradition Act; EAW validity checklist; EAW first appearance checklist; bail checklist; case management form; and the application notice on Form N161.<br /><br />As Senior District Judge Howard Riddle writes in the Foreword, \\"a person arrested on an extradition warrant needs help\\". He goes on to say that \\"extradition is stressful, usually more stressful than domestic criminal proceedings\\". The importance of the first hearing is stressed with the point that the lawyer must `'get it right'.<br /><br />With the rise in the number of hearings - 100 new cases a year at the old Bow Street court before the new legislation to 1,700 a year at Westminster Magistrates' Court - and Divisional Court/Supreme Court decisions it is clear that `the potential for litigating a new point is far from exhausted' as Riddle.  To add to this, there are now 4 extradition courts working every day, plus the court on a Saturday to handle the increased workload.<br /><br />Extradition law is an area where both Defendants and the Judiciary rely greatly on the expertise of the specialist lawyer.  Grange and Niblock have filled the gap in the already available texts on extradition with this work and, as Riddle says, it not only will be but is `a very significant addition to the literature in this field'.<br /><br />The last word goes to the authors who say in the Preface that the book is written with the duty solicitor in mind and no one can disagree that `the book is one that will fit handsomely into the busy lawyer's bag and prove invaluable as a tool to tackle the minefield of extradition law and procedure'.  How right they are- LAG helps us all immensely with this new publication as LAG remains top of our list for easy-to-use, straight-forward practitioner books at all levels of practice.in the already available texts on extradition with this work and, as Riddle says, it not only will be but is `a very significant addition to the literature in this field'.<br /><br />The last word goes to the authors who say in the Preface that the book is written with the duty solicitor in mind and no one can disagree that `the book is one that will fit handsomely into the busy lawyer's bag and prove invaluable as a tool to tackle the minefield of extradition law and procedure'.

1846615518|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1SF0DAR10AISK]]A STEP BY STEP MANUAL OF THE COMPLETE DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Much have we heard of due diligence of late. As expert author Vanessa Williams explains, the difficult economic conditions of recent years `have lifted due diligence to higher prominence'.  One might add that in the wake of stringent and very recent anti-bribery legislation, awareness of the dire necessity for due diligence is now very prominent indeed.<br /><br />In this clear and concise work of reference, the author describes due diligence as `the process of investigation through which a potential purchaser gains a complete understanding of the target business or its assets for acquisition, evaluating both the strengths and the weaknesses of the business and reaching conclusions as to whether to proceed with a purchase, reduce the price or restructure the transaction.'<br /><br />Based on the time-honoured principle of `caveat emptor' due diligence is a process by which, for example, solicitors and other parties working on mergers and acquisitions, management buy-outs, or buy-ins, or other corporate financial transactions, check out the company they may seek to acquire -- and a very thorough and systematic check it is.<br /><br />Writing in the preface, Williams notes that, interestingly, there is often a slight disconnect between the need for a rigorous, thoroughly professional and essentially watertight due diligence process and what she has observed as the relative inexperience of the practitioners who typically carry it out, many of whom are at the beginning of their careers.  But what they may lack in in-depth understanding of due diligence, however, might be made up for by their acquiring a copy of this book.<br /><br />The book's sub-title is indicative.  It is indeed a step-by-step manual of the complete due diligence process from start to finish.  Here in a single handbook is everything that the company and its professional advisers need regarding the transaction itself, as well as points of concern, precedents and potential pitfalls.<br /><br />Approximately one quarter of the guide takes the reader through the procedure itself, including reviewing all relevant information, from accounts... to general and intangible assets to... yes, anti-bribery and corruption and other issues including real property and software.  Further specific issues, including post-completion issues, are examined in depth.<br /><br />The remaining three-quarters of the book then goes on to list sample documents and explanatory notes supplemented by general and specific comments. Included in the accompanying CD ROM, this section functions as a due diligence toolkit; indispensable, we would say, for anyone involved in the due diligence process, from novices to experienced practitioners.<br /><br />Note that this new, second edition of this authoritative work reflects recent changes in legislation and provides sharp and timely warnings of potential traps and pitfalls.  With its practical, business-focused approach, this book should be considered a must-have purchase for practitioners or advisers wishing to enhance their understanding of the due diligence process.  The law stated is accurate at December 2012.e handbook is everything that the company and its professional advisers need regarding the transaction itself, as well as points of concern, precedents and potential pitfalls.<br /><br />Approximately one quarter of the guide takes the reader through the procedure itself, including reviewing all relevant information, from accounts... to general and intangible assets to... yes, anti-bribery and corruption and other issues including real property and software.

1846615542|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3APZIGE2OF88M]]THERE OUGHTA BE A LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Meetings, as the authors of this book remind us `have ensured our survival as a species'.  One cannot disagree there.  Human beings crave association and communication with one another, usually to share views impart information, elicit support, change minds, make decisions, impose power,  diffuse power, spread responsibility, share blame- and so on.<br /><br />This distinguished legal text from Jordans, however, examines and explains -- with outstanding clarity and insight -- the law and practice of specific kinds of meetings, namely company meetings, insolvency meetings, local authority meetings and meetings convened to conduct business, including meetings of limited companies...of creditors...of public bodies...and private associations.<br /><br />The special value of this book is that it presents the law and practice of meetings in a clear, concise manner including convening, conducting and recording the meeting; in short, its general management.  The importance of this subject in the conduct of business generally and to the wider economy, is reflected in the fact that this is the third edition of this volume since the publication of the first edition in 2005.<br /><br />Much has changed in this area of law in recent years as the authors point out.  This new edition, therefore, contains much new material. The changes made to the original provisions of the Companies Act 2006, for example, are covered in detail, including the legal and practical consequences.  The chapter on local authority meetings has also undergone a number of changes to reflect the impact of the Localism Act 2011.<br /><br />Other new material includes that which deals with meetings of health bodies following on from the Health and Social Care Act 2012.  Also it is worth noting the substantial amount of comment on electronic communications, namely in general meetings and in board meetings.<br /><br />Quite rightly, the book has been described as invaluable for company and insolvency practitioners, as well as local authorities, company directors and company secretaries.  Those doing further legal research to support client initiatives will appreciate the extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, European materials and insolvency rules, as well as the three appendices.  And for practitioners under pressure, the detailed table of contents and the lengthy index at the back make things much easier to look up.<br /><br />Anyone concerned with law and best practice pertaining to meetings should acquire a copy of this highly regarded and up-to-date legal text in which the law is stated as at 1 January 2013.namely in general meetings and in board meetings.<br /><br />Quite rightly, the book has been described as invaluable for company and insolvency practitioners, as well as local authorities, company directors and company secretaries.

0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a children's fairy tale made for adults. Like most of Neil Gaiman's books, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is so quirky and surreal that it is difficult to summarize and review. Reading this was like drifting off into a dream, or a long forgotten childhood memory. The story begins when a middle-age adult wanders back to his childhood home and visits the farm where he recalls some unusual events taking place when he was very young. As he reminisces on these strange happenings, a rather eerie fairy tale unfolds for the reader.<br /><br />I listened to this on audio which is always such a treat when Neil Gaiman is narrating his own stories. Gaiman so perfectly captures every nuance of expression and personality of his characters as well as creates an almost dreamlike atmosphere for the story itself. He is absolutely a master storyteller. The Ocean at the End of the Lane was quite short, not quite a novella but rather shorter than most novels, but it still managed to contain a complete and hypnotic story.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this and every other book Neil Gaiman has written to anyone who enjoys an unusual and beautifully written fairy tale.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Excellent cast, screen play, stellar direction, beautiful cinematography. Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is captured in a romantic, non-melodramatic way in this film. It's a 'must see' for all fans of period movies; but especially those who love Austen and her work.
0307341550|5.0|Sharp Objects tells the story of Camille, a journalist living in Chicago, who is asked to return to the small town where she is from to cover an unfolding story about 2 murdered girls. This also gives Camille the opportunity to reconnect with her family, an opportunity she didn't necessarily wish for. It seems that Camille and her mother have many unresolved issues revolving around her childhood & the death of her sister when Camille was just 13. Camille also has a younger sister that she barely knows having been away for so long. To call this family dysfunctional is an understatement. The mother is so vile and distasteful in the sick way she gives and withholds love as a means to control. The 13 year old little sister is maniacally manipulative & known to be the vicious head of the \\"mean girl\\" clique at school. Camille herself is understandably damaged and tries to cope by carving words into her skin to deal with her pain.<br /><br />I love that this author unflinchingly takes the reader to very dark places in this book. The characters are seldom likable but are so authentic in their broken lives. Sharp Objects explores the real consequences of extreme unhealthy mother-child relationships. The damage that a mentally disturbed parent can cause is far reaching and can last far beyond childhood. This story also shows how easily such sickness can be overlooked by everyone, people refusing to see what is right in front of them. This is definitely not a book that will leave a reader with a happy, hopeful feeling. It is dark and disturbing and can leave the reader feeling a bit unclean. But Sharp objects is also undeniably a fascinating story, expertly written, with authentic characters that, while not always likable, will draw a reader in making them want to understand their motivations.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this to anyone who, like me, enjoys stories that are a bit more dark and with unexpected villains. This is the second of Gillian Flynn's books I've read and I am officially a fan. I can't wait to read more from this author.and I am officially a fan. I can't wait to read more from this author.

0440242401|4.0|This was a quick fun read. I always enjoy those stories where the female wakes up from some kind of accident and finds herself living a completely different life, probably because subconsciously (or even consciously) I would myself love to suddenly wake up thin, beautiful, and rich! Remember me is fairly predictable but still such a fun read with plenty of laugh out loud moments and without those jarring instances of cheesy dialog that I always seem to run into in these types of books. This is, I believe, the first book I've read by Sophie Kinsella although I know I have several of her books on my shelf, so I'm looking forward to enjoying more of her writing. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something light and entertaining.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers World Tour is a great game. You Surf in the Subway in many places: Tokyo, Paris, all with diffrent Subway design, and one limeted character. I recommend this game to anyone who likes a variety. You spend about a month playing in for exsample Tokyo Then you go to Paris. The graphics are great and there are no glitches that I have found. It gets a little bit boreing though, cause all your doing is jumping, dogeing, and ducking things. This game is basicly Temple Run but I like it alot better. I hope you've found this helpful. Thanks for reading!

And extroverts will end up with more respect and acceptance of introverts. I definitely recommend this!

I don' t recall ever hearing more perfect sounding renditions of these radio smashes from the early 60's through the chart-topping \\"Grease\\" in 1978. Thrill to the Seasons best:\\"Sherry\\", \\"Walk Like A Man\\", through \\"December, 1963\\". Of special mention is the original hit version of \\"Dawn ( Go Away)\\" featuring the intro \\"Pretty Eyes Amid Summer's Morn...They called her Dawn.....\\" I have the original Philips hit single...THAT'S the one! Frankie Valli's incredible solo hit \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" is included...plus his two other smashes.  Then there is \\"Rag Doll\\". One of my favorite records of all time...and my most beloved recording by The Four Seasons. A masterpiece! I recall hearing an interview with Frankie  Valli years ago and when asked if they knew \\"Rag Doll\\" was special after they finished recording it, he said absolutely yes. This is a wonderful CD...a must-have. If I am completey honest, I do wish they included about five or so more tunes (clocking in currently at just over 60 min., they could fit)...specifically \\"Tell It To The Rain\\", The \\"Wonder Who\\", \\"Silver Star\\", and a couple of others. But, the last thing I would want to do is nitpik...few compilations by any artist will have everything that everyone wants.This collection is virtually flawless! A grand slam home run! You'll absolutely love it! In as much as The Four Seasons got their name from a bowling alley, I probably should have said this collection is a 300 game!

1439153663|3.0|A friend recommended this one, saying it was similar to The Help.  It did not even come close.  The character development was shallow.  The author stated that she did extensive historical research, but little reference was made to it in her pages.  It's unfortunate that the author didn't develop more of a plot; she just kept going back to writing about who fathered whom, and the male characters' multiple partners.  Mitchell was a mad man, but the character was so extreme; it seemed farfetched.  We are familiar with the many atrocities faced by those who were enslaved; the author taught me nothing new. I looked forward to immersing myself into a historical drama, but was disappointed.

What do you say about one of the greatest books you've ever read?<br /><br />I'll begin like this: Have you ever seen two people engaged in one-upmanship? Who has it worst? The one guy or the other girl? It's a competition with little merit and little is gained by the spectators. One or the other is crowned the King or Queen of Misery. Whoopie-doo.<br /><br />It's a truism everyone goes through hard times. Few have gone through a hard time that tests the mettle of ones heart, mind and health more than a Nazi concentration camp. That's not the point, though. Neither is it just how much time Frankl spent in Auschwitz versus some other less-infamous camp. What matters is what the experience did to Frankl and what he teaches us of those experiences. After reading this book I feel ever so slightly wiser because I have tried to vicariously understand the horror of the concentration camp. As well written as this book is, language is an imperfect medium. On some level, I will never understand the horror. I never lived it. Nor do I ever want to.<br /><br />I gained a lot from this book in some non-concrete ways. Frankl would have been an amazing person to have met or to have heard speak. Even if you read \\"Search for Meaning\\" merely to find out what the camps were like, it succeeds. If you're such a person, you might want to skip the last half where he discusses his theory. I've seen documentaries on the holocaust and been to the museum in Washington, D.C. To me, all of those experiences pale to reading this book. Frankl discusses aspects to camp life that are relatively untouched in those popularized exhibitions. For example, the mindset of the inmates or the Capos. Those kinds of memories would be uncomfortable for most. Heck, thinking about genocide is uncomfortable for most. Frankl is an unflinching witness.<br /><br />For those who are brave enough to read this book, it's well worth it.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|The game itself is very very fun and cute. It will provide hours of entertainment guaranteed.<br />People are complaining about it taking a snapshot of your tasks, and they don't need to do that, but really who cares if they see what other apps you use? It's not like they can access your private info.
0452295548|4.0|Although this book is a little more scientifically worded, it still gets the message across.  It does a wonderful job of explaining through the author's experience of what it is like inside the brain after a stroke.  I found it helpful to know what to expect from a loved one that had a stroke.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I've been a fan of the show and missed this past season.  I love that I can watch it on Amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am glad this game was free because the graphics where amazing.Also the game itself was great.And this is from Universal so of course it's great!
1442359919|4.0|have always enjoyed Stephen King's work - and even though it wasn't spooky dooky and other worldly I enjoyed this one too
0345529057|5.0|Any fan of fantasy should be enthralled by this series. More mature than your average story though, but very well written. I just started the 4th book and was blown away by the third. Cannot wait to finish and buy the fifth book.
B000002MU3|4.0|First of all most of the people are complaining about this album that R.E.M. were departing from their sound and blah, blah. Nope...REM started as a alternative rock band. This is basically ''the return to the roots''. Out of time and Automatic were the albums that REM changed into a more pop rock band.<br />I like this CD . Pure rock music.<br />I love all the songs, except Tongue and Circus Envy.<br />Great CD.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|A good thriller in the style Patricia Highsmith, though not as original in concept. Perfect book to read for holidays.
B00ADMZUVO|4.0|Clearly written, thorough and sincere account &#34;from the source&#34;. Some self-congratulation, but justified. A mammoth account of a mammoth achievement.  Thoroughly recommended...
B0006PV5VC|5.0|The melody is marvellous and memorable, AND THIS CD is probably one of the best renditions of the music that I have heard.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Whenever I pick up a neil gaiman book, I expect to love it and I want to love it and unfortunately that was not the case with the ocean at the end of the lane. is it for adults or is it YA? hard to say. it is a slim tome and an easy read, however i just didn't bond with any of the characters. there are some exciting times, but it is missing something that makes you care. maybe i will try the audio as i love the author as narrator but as for the written form, it was a disappointment. if you want to read great gaiman, read the graveyard book (YA) or good omens (adult)
1781162646|3.0|Not the best Stephen King I've ever read. I was a little disappointed. But, it held my attention and it was a quick read.

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Another great book by Khaled. Multiple stories tying up into one. Very emotive, but a thousand splendid suns still my best  book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I loved this book I learned many things I didn't know previously. I would recommend this book especially for teaching.
B009R659L8|5.0|I think this rates a 4.4. .Well written with a new back ground in the furniture biz.i'll look for more of her books in the future!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|i was not convinced by the basic premise that zombies are a formidable enemy. Enough ammo and you're golden.<br />The Terkel format is not entirely successful.
0486438600|2.0|I thought this book was going to have many more designs and be much much thicker. Unfortunately, I paid WAY too much for a book that only has like 30 pages.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This was going to be  short review like the CD itself, but as you can see this did not occur. Its short yes, but its sweet (sorry).  Queensryche was my favorite band between Operation Mindcrime-HITNF.  Yes, I even liked that one.  It was around the time of Q2k, I started liking only sporadic songs until Dedicated, which I did not dislike, but it was not Queensryche. This CD Queensryche (2013) is a return back to the form that us longtime fans appreciate; Progressive Metal with a melodic edge.  Would I have liked more or longer songs? Would I have liked a contribution from Chris Degarmo? Would I have liked a concept Album? Yes, Yes, and Yes.  However what we got was great and I have listened to it at least 5 times since its arrival in the mail(yesterday).  This is something that has not happened to me from a recent release in some time.  That coupled with my eager anticipation of its arrival, lead me to only one conclusion 5 Stars. The short duration actually works as you get to re-listen to songs, none of which are filler, over and over. This outing definitely whets your appetite for more which I hope will not take too long. Side notes - I have developed an additction to the song SPORE. Todd does a great job.  Speak the Word, support the RYCHE.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|This is David Garrett's latest concert, and is one of his best. If you like his other concerts, this one is a must have. I've been to 2 of his concerts live, and was very good.
B009MYARIK|4.0|As all Sophie Kinsella's books, easy to read. Nice plot, not as funny as other Kinsella's books.<br />Very light read.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|What can a person really write about a classic? This is the story of a dog kidnapped from southern CA and swept off to the harsh Alaskan Yukon to be a sled dog. Jack London expertly shares the trials and hardhips of living in the North as well as exposing the treatment of a survival necessity - the dogs.<br /><br />My daughter (8yo) has read her hard copy out of its binding, still bringing it to my husband to read excerpts for Daddy/Daughter time. I downloaded the kindle version for it to be easier for him to read to her. He's very grateful.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best novels I have read lately. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys of good books.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I love it every time I watch it. It's great for any age and even if you're not a fan of this animation style, once you start watching it you get invested into the story and to soon its over.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app sucks as soon as I clicked on a video it turns off dose not work on kindle fire. Don't download !!!!!!!!  =(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be just a good game for my nephew, but after giving it a try, it turned out to be challenging. Although I tj<br />hink the prices of some of the characters and clothing are too expensive.
1416955070|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all time. In my opinion better than Tolkien. Amazerful!! I love that's romantic and dark at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is  is better than temple run  you can buy anything you want which is awesome because you can buy and unlock other awesome runners

1585673927|4.0|Carry On, Jeeves\\" is the first in the classic series by P.G. Wodehouse. Though I'd already quaffed several of Wodehouse's ninety books, this is where we are introduced to the inimitable Jeeves, the \\"gentleman's personal gentleman\\" who \\"shimmers\\" and \\"oozes\\" in and out of rooms. Jeeves' vastly superior intellect is regularly pressed into service to help his employer, young, rich, idle Bertie Wooster, to get \\"out of the boullion,\\" where he has a habit of landing.<br /><br />Bertie Wooster has just enough bean power to recognize Jeeves' value, and expresses it this way: \\"The man's a genius. From the collar upward he stands alone.\\" Jeeves consistently disapproves of Bertie's sartorial decisions, and its always funny to watch Bertie try to withstand the stress. When Bertie defiantly grows a moustache, \\"it cut Jeeves to the quick. He couldn't stick the thing at any price, and I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till I was getting jolly well fed up with it. What I mean is, while there's no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeve's judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume.\\"<br /><br />The series of stories have a similar theme: one of Bertie's friends, like him part of idle and intellectually challenged rich, get into some spot of trouble, from which Jeeves helps rescue them. But the language is so inventive and so consistently funny, and the predicaments are also very amusing, that the other \\"sameness\\" doesn't detract one bit.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I won a kindle fire and this was one of the first apps I got. You can dress up the girl, do her make up and take her to the spa. This app is awesome and I recommend you get it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has excellent graphics and game play very creepy and mysterious a must have if you like the mystery games
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Beautiful graphics, interesting game!  Challenging puzzles that make you think, and there is a &quot;hint&quot; button in case you get stuck.<br /> Looking forward to 2nd part!
B0047SF41G|5.0|IMO, a nice escape from RL for an afternoon. like to see where this franchise goes from here. decent price.
B000U6DU92|4.0|In Eureka Season 1, Episode 9, we are introduced to Saul Rubinek, the brain behind Warehouse 13, a later series which is successful now on SyFy channel.  Both series explore 'science' effects of articles which can destroy people or the world. The main popular science questions are explored with humor, en route.<br /><br />'Eureka' is premised on a town full of science geeks whose experiments and creations, often go wrong.  Each episode takes you through something that goes wrong, and how it gets righted, all within the hour.  The longterm plot is also canned:  some evil nefarious outside group, related to some corporate entity or the Government, is out to remove and use, stuff created within Eureka.<br /><br />However, within Eureka, another corporate entity houses the experiments and creations, and everyone within Eureka is directly or indirectly dependent on that entity.  It is run by kind persons.  So the series offers a dual-sided perspective of corporate headship, not merely the stereotypical Big Evil Corporation lie so many have come to love.<br /><br />Eureka's cast chemistry, however, doesn't synergize until well past the 2nd season.  Maybe that slowness is a director decision, using the initial awkwardness to create tension?  For until well into Season 2, the actors seem to just speak lines and move per blocking directives.  As if ordered to behave, woodenly.<br /><br />The characters are human enough, and the acting is good.  Script is lackadasical, until well after the 2nd season begins, so one is tempted to quit watching.  Don't quit.<br /><br />Canned nature of the episodes is also detrimental, wash rinse repeat.  So you already know how each episode will turn out.  Even so, the plots are intertwined, and the scripting gets better with each episode.  So eventually, both the characters and the plots, grow on you.  Series is worth re-watching, worth buying.s far is based on viewing the entire first Season and two Episodes of the 2nd.  Maybe will re-rate, after viewing more.  As it stands, I can't fathom how this series lasted five seasons.  Maybe it gets better.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great little app. I love the  large virtual buttons. The app does what it should well. It is worth double the price
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a pleasure to use.  The large button are great but my favorite feature is the shadow last calculation that kept me on track.<br />Be sure to check out the advanced functions under the memory keys, just swipe.
B00AKKS278|5.0|Hal's book is absolutely amazing!  I had just finished a book regarding taking baby steps to reach my goals. I had implemented my own plan. Then read Hals book. I am looking forward to beginning my Miracle Mornings and I can't wait to share what I've learned. Thank you so much Hal!
B008B0QH5S|3.0|\\"It's all about me me me me yes yes yes yes you you you you no no no no.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're a winner, I'm a winner.\\"<br /><br />\\"You've been around but you don't look to rough, and I still quite like some of your early stuff.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's got to be a future, or the world will end today.\\"<br /><br />Age has not mellowed the Pet Shop Boys, but it's done something else entirely. It's caused them to take themselves deathly seriously while, at the same time, not taking themselves seriously at all. I know, that doesn't make much sense. But neither does \\"Elysium\\". Yeah, I like the Pet Shop Boys as much as the next guy, and there are tracks here that I like, one of which I quoted above. But I can't help but feel that Tennant and Lowe are having a joke at our expense, one where only they know the punch line. It's like Weezer's \\"Red Album\\" all over again. I seriously grappled with that one. Was this stuff written in earnest?<br /><br />But to be fair, \\"Elysium\\" has more going for it, like \\"Invisible\\", \\"Memory of the Future\\" \\"Requiem in Denim...\\" and strangely enough, my daughter likes \\"A Face Like That\\". But I have to gripe with some website that said that the single \\"Leaving\\" was one of the duos best songs in ten years or something like that. Bull. There's plenty of more satisfying stuff from \\"Yes\\" and \\"Fundamental\\". Not that I don't like \\"Leaving\\" - I do. I just hate hyperbole like that.<br /><br />Still, I bought it and I don't regret it. I'm going to legitimately purchase \\"Electricity\\" this year, but I sure hope the sillies leave their system soon. \\"Elysium\\" is okay, but I don't want them to ride into the sunset like this.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked it not my favorite i did not like the ending and a little sad we have to wait for another book even though I love to read about Eva and Gideon. The book had some boring spots did not care about Cary the roommate and his problems at all. Cant wait for more just hope we do not have to wait a whole year to find out.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I just loved CCR and in my opinion, nothing can match the original versions! However, it's good to see John back enjoying music again.
0896898288|5.0|There are plenty of blocks in this book, and lots of opportunity to make your own special sampler.  The letters are an interesting sidelight... but let's face it:  most quilters bought the book for the quilt, not the letters.  Still, they are an excellent bonus!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is an app that you<br /> should try it lets you this that you want. also one Direction talk to me and send me a message so have<br /> fun when you download it
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla has been one of the dolls that I had a super hard time getting. Finally when she became available on Amazon for $19.99 I snapped her up. I was excited about Twyla from the stock picture but when she arrived I was even more impressed with how adorable she is. Twyla is a smaller sized doll (the same size as Howleen). The thing I like the most is the spider and web theme she has throughout her outfit and accessories (I didn't even notice it on the stock pictures). Twyla's hair is mostly seafoam green with stripes of cobalt blue and a very few thin dark purple stripes. It is slightly wavy with blunt cut bangs. Her skintone is a beautiful shade of lavender except for her hands which are metallic grey that fades out as it goes up her forearm towards her elbow. She also has wispy metallic grey designs on her lower legs. Her eyes are really lovely being mostly pink and purple and having larger black pupils (I imaging these enlarged pupils come from her need to see in the dark. That is a very clever attention to detail on the part of the designer). Her makeup is minimal but it works for her. Her upper eye has black eyeliner and eyelashes with her lower eyeliner and eyelashes being purple. She has a line of lavender painted under her lower eye but it is so close to her skin color you can hardly detect it. Her lips are a stunning shade of metallic mauve. Her eyebrows are green which stands out nicely against the color of her skin. Her 3/4 sleeve top is a dark purple with black stripes down printed on it with little spiders dotted along the stripes. The shirt has a black collar with a bow tied at the front. Her three tiered skirt is a mix of a black background with a seafoam green swirl design with a purple tulle ruffle sewn at the end of each tier. Her belt is seafoam green plastic with a skullette right at the center, and dangling down from the skullette is a small spider. Her earrings are light metallic silver escutcheons with little doorknobs and even a keyhole. On her left wrist she wears two thin lavender and one thin black bracelet. On her right wrist she wears a seafoam green bracelet that has a spider web that is shaped like skullette with three tiny spiders hanging from that. Her adorable dark purple kisslock purse features a black strap, intricate molded scrollwork and a light green skullette shaped web with five minatures spiders dangling from the web painted on the front. Her shoes are dark purple oxford style pumps with green laces with spiders at the ends and and a black scrolled heel and platform. Her pet dust bunny Dustin is also very cute. He is lavender with a little pink nose, a grey button for a right eye, and a green stitch for a left eye. His little ears are standing up and he has the cutest surprised expression. He is quite large, (in fact I think other than Nightmare he is probably the largest MH pet so far). Twyla comes with a black stand and brush and her diary. Overall I think Twyla is a fantastic addition to any monster high collection.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I ended up deleting this app because my phone was constantly beeping and dying faster. I hated to do it, but I just didn't have time to try to figure out how to calm it down.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John does not disappoint, his later work is strong however his earlier work are masterpieces of the rock era.  Many modern classic artists are on the duet bandwagon and John's work deserves the same treatment.  As an aging baby boomer, I can highly recommend this CD.  BTW, buy the physical CD and try to refrain from downloading compressed and inferior fidelity products.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game can be addictive. My daughter introduced me to it, and I love it! I would recommend others to try it out.
B0011V7P0A|5.0|Tom deserves a place at the top of rocks greats.  Here is a compendium of his greatest tunes, conveniently packaged in one CD.  Of course, not all favorites are included but enough to make this well worth the money.  The CD is acceptably mastered but not the ne plus ultra for you audiophiles.  Of course, buy the CD and skip the compressed downloads.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|Great concert with legendary guitar players, must see Tal Lingenfeld on the bass doubling up Jeff Beck, she is an incredible talent.
0439023483|5.0|Loved this young adult novel, even as an adult!  I could not stop reading this series and had to read the other 2 books immediately as the author left you hanging, especially after this first book.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Great insight and wonderful to see these legends talk and tell  how they developed their style and show their inspiration and skills.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is just as enjoyable as the version I have for my 3ds. It doesn't seem to be one of those games that is a money trap. It is i think a bit more limited than the scribblenauts that i have.
B0007TKNII|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS INCREDIBLE,.WHO DOESN'T LOVE THE HOIW ITS BESHOWING FOR OVER 25 YEARS AND GERARD BUTLER WAS GREAT AS WERE PATRIC WILSON, EMMA HAS A LOVELY VOICE AND MINNIE DRIVER WAS GREAT!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a fun app and he guess my character no matter how obsucre the book. But my dad always stumps him :-
B0091REZMW|4.0|Having fun so far! yay! Let's see how this game goes! Looking forward to what comes next on the game.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|I love the film and I love the music.  I'm not generally a huge Nick Cave fan, but this soundtrack is just awesome.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great narration great story wonderfully image building. I am looking forward to more from this author. Suggest this to all that will listen.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I may be biased since the actual Bondurant brother's were my gg-grandmother's cousins...and because this was filmed not far from my house, but it really is a great  movie.  I had wondered if it would do the book justice and it definitely delivered.  I wasn't a Shia LaBeouf fan before, but he really did do a great job portraying Jack the way you see him in the book.
B00C5W3SBE|2.0|Oz the Great and Powerful has a few bright moments but not enough to save it from mediocrity.  The special effect are terrific and that's about all you can say about it.  While I've enjoyed James Franco in some other things, he just isn't a good fit for this.  Mila Kunis is the best thing in the movie. She makes a great witch and she makes her transformation work as well anybody could have.  Save your time and your money, there are plenty of other shows better than this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far thee greatest app ever, I want more, I absolutely loved it.  I could do this for hours, I didn't want it to end.  Make more, huge fan.<br />Please make a longer version.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|Not really my cup of tea. I enjoyed the first half with the exciting dialogue but tired as the story made itself felt.
