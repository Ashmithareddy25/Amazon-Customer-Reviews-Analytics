B0008G2IRO|5.0|The gorillaz is a vary cool band! They merge pop, rock and rap in to the same CD. The Demon Days CD is much darker then the original but some songs are fun and uplifting, well is uplifting as the gorillazs can make it. So I would recommend this CD to the more experienced gorillaz fan.    <br />  <br />
B000001DVD|5.0|Def Leppard was a HARD rock group.  Unfortunately, that came and went this album.  Since they wanted to make money, they followed Mutt Lange's advice to go the pop-metal/rock route.  Yes, they've made a ton of cash, but have lost their original two guitar players (Steve Clark still stands as one of the most underrated guitarists ever), and their balls in the process.  Younger fans probably don't realize that they used to be a hard drinking, go-for-the-throat rock and roll band.  With PYROMANIA, they decided they could buy more alcohol if they could appeal to the masses, and that's what happened.  Their last (and best) song was 'Me and My Wine'-only released on a HIGH N' DRY re-release, in 1984.  I suggest you find that copy of HIGH N' DRY, as it is the definitive Def Leppard, when they were a HARD rock band.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I was always a fan of Gorillaz since i first heard the debut album back in '03, but i was younger then and did not quite get the fullest out of the album at the time. but 2 years later, my musical tastes are somewhat more refined. and i definately had high hopes for \\"demon days\\" - and let me tell you, the band has far surpassed anything i could've expected. as far as a comparitive to the first album, demon days is a much more produced-sounding album, with a ton of electronica elements, and a dance-party vibe saturating this thing. the debut album was a more raw, unpolished insight to the obvious talent of Albarn's creation.  <br /> <br />Intro - starting the album is a kooky synthorgan/acordian peice, with various samplings and turntables thrown in.  <br /> <br />Last Living Souls - excellent sonf to break in the new album. this track really gives a taste of what their new sound is all about. there is a fuzzy guitar riff seeping through the song, with symphonic strings and an electronica-like drum machine pattern. very nice clean guitar/piano interlude. 2-D's vocals are at near perfect in this track - just rolling out and chillin. <br /> <br />Kids With Guns - lead by a funky bassline. one of the better tracks in my opinion. dirty guitars and synths swap licks throughout this song. Albarn's vocals on the choruses just continue to blow me away. <br /> <br />O Green World - more fast paced than the previous songs, this track opens with a quirky synth part and D's vocals seem almost nursery rhyme-ish, i love it!. one thing that stands out on this track are the sparratic rap interludes. the drums just pound out the entire time, giving it a very daceworthy element. <br /> <br />Dirty Harry - the intro here is very bare-bones electronica, but quickly picks up with some melodic buildups and then it breaks down with a very 70's funkish type of sound. the synth is incredible here, and the drums are more controlled than in the last track. <br /> <br />Feel Good Inc. - kickingoff with a maniacal laugh, we delve into the albums first single. the bass here is extraordinary, locking into a sweet combination with the guitar. Albarn's vocals are amazing here, sounding like an old phonograph recording. good rap interlude via de la soul, which is a very good thing. i especially like the bridge in this song, one of the more coherent guitar parts on the album. <br /> <br />El Manana - a synth based track with awesome dirty guitar riffs. this is a very laid-back, jazz-lounge type song. some of the more thought-out sounding lyrics are on this song as well. <br /> <br />Every Planet We Reach is Dead - very good track here. the darker synth, and funk-wah guitar really speak on this track. the verses feature great harmony parts, and build up perfectly to the instumental choruses. <br /> <br />November Has Come - good hip-hop intro with a very old school drum and guitar sound. the choruses really lay down the vibe for this track. <br /> <br />All Alone - starts with a wierd vocal intro, building up with synths - then the drums kick in and the track is off! starting right up with a flowing dance-party rap vocal. the harpsichord-like synth is great, but the sampling on the bridge combined with the excellent vocals really take it for this track. <br /> <br />White Light - distorted vocals repeating 'alcohol' 'white light' with fuzzed guitar and driving drums - 'nuff said! <br /> <br />DARE - one of the best tracks on the album, by far. very danceheavy type synths are all over this one. the drums are very club sounding. the vocals are simply stunning. . this one will be another single.  <br /> <br />Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's head - spoken track about a mountain and it's inhabitants, interrupted with singing interludes. lot interpreting for the individual, i'll stop there. this is a good one folks. <br /> <br />Don't Get Lost In Heaven - Beach Boys-esque track, full of reverb and chiming - vocals not one of my favourites, though it's definately a showof versatility on Damon's part. <br /> <br />Demon Days - probably the most different track on the album. nearly all orchestral strings finishing the heaven track. perfect to wrap up this incredible album!
B000003TAW|3.0|I don't mean to ruin the five-star party, especially given that a number of good friends of mine do love this album.  But, despite the fact that I really liked Undone, Buddy Holly, and Say It Ain't So on the radio, I just have a hard time listening to this album and getting into it.  Weezer seems stuck in a rut stylistically-- every song has the same heavy guitar sound, mixed in with the occassional light acoustic guitar.  While other bands do the same thing without it getting really bothersome, Weezer's sound grates on me after a few songs.  That said, Holiday and Garage are good songs, and you probably already like the singles if you're reading this.  But for what it's worth, the bulk of the album doesn't do anything for me that the singles didn't.  3 and a half stars.
0618526412|5.0|This book is set in a small, indistinct southern town, full of misfits -- people who don't feel like they quite fit in anywhere -- with different desires and dreams. A lot of what McCullers focuses on is the inability of individuals to express themselves to others. Instead, they put their energies towards self-destructive habits such as drinking, fighting, and sexual depravity.<br />Two of the main characters are Mick Kelly and John Singer. Mick is a young tomboy who comes of age in the story. She doesn't have money for instruments or lessons, but she goes through a deeply personal attempt to find the kind of happiness and beauty she finds from musical expression. Mick, like many of the townspeople, finds beauty and intrigue in the deaf mute, John Singer. John Singer leads a quiet life, but is deeply troubled by the loss of his longtime friend Anatopolous, who is also a deaf mute. John Singer becomes a mystical figure to the townspeople, becoming a projection of each individual's personal desires. Part of his mysticism forms around the fact that he is a deaf mute, therefore communication is limited, mostly a one-way event. People pour all their wishes and dreams into their projections of him.<br />Amazingly, Carson McCullers was only 23 when this book was published. How a person that young (well, my age, in fact) could write with such an insightful view of humanity, as well as politics, art & music is impressive. Her prose is descriptive, but at the same time spare. The narrator of the book gives a limited-omniscient view, so while you know what each character might think, you feel you only are scratching the surface of their thoughts. In many cases, what you find is that the individuals themselves don't quite understand their own motives or desires. <br />This book in many ways reminds me of Sherwood Anderson's classic novel, Winesburg, Ohio. It shares commonality in narrative style, themes of isolation, loneliness and the inability to express everything in words.The power of these books is not in what is said or the events themselves, but the things left unexplained, what we are prompted to think about as a result. I enjoyed Heart Is a Lonely Hunter very much, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Carson McCullers, but very much on my mind since I purchased a \\"used\\" copy off Amazon is \\"The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition,\\" an odd, engaging, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about.
0345423496|5.0|The final installment of Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Odyssey\\" quartet, \\"3001: the Final Odyssey\\" features the return of Frank Poole, a fascinating look at what life could be like in the 31st century, and final answers to some of the most asked questions in the history of science-fiction.<br /><br />While it lacks an even-flow to the narrative (even more so than \\"2061: Odyssey Three), it is still a wonderful tale full of mystery, beauty, wonder, and terror. Fans of the other novels will not want to miss this one.<br /><br />\\"3001: The Final Odyssey\\" is a great read, and an outstanding finale to one of the greatest science-fiction series ever written! Grade: A-

B0007TKNL0|4.0|While I've never been to the theatre performance of this particular musical, I decided to see this film version because I thought the original story written by the French novelist would be rendered more visually detailed.   <br /> <br />My curiosity for this film was heightened when I found out that the Phantom role was played by the actor, who strongly impressed me with his outstanding acting in the role of a modern-day archeologist turned a brave and romantic medieval knight, Andre Marek, in \\"Timeline.\\"   <br /> <br />Some musical goers criticized this film as an inferior copy of the stage format.  Actually, I was somewhat bored with the part where the new owners took over the management of the opera house and Carlotta throws a fit and quits.  But once the Phantom appeared in front of Christine, the spectacle of the music and richly evocative cinematography drew me into the magical world created by Webber and Schumacher. <br /> <br />The real tragedy of this story is that the society was inhumanely cruel to the Phantom from his birth, and mistreated and misunderstood him only because of the deformity, forcing him to live in the dark dungeon all alone, longing for someone to love him.  So the Phantom was the real victim of the cruel fate.  This film version seems to highlight that aspect of the story more than other versions, giving it a deeper perspective on Phantom's psyche, which was genuinely interpreted and enacted by Butler.   <br /> <br />Rossum's brilliant performance as Christine really shines when she expresses her underlying attraction to Phantom, and towards the end, her sympathy and compassion for her former teacher.  To be honest, I thought this Christine looked far more attracted to the masked man with a half-deformed face than her sweetheart Raoul, and even kissed Phantom more passionately and intimately than she kissed Raoul.  That could be because, unlike the Phantom in the other versions, Butler is amazingly alluring and captivating even with theexposed prosthetic deformity on one side of his face. <br /> <br />While Wilson has a smooth elastic voice typical of many musical singers, his Raoul seemed a little flat and lacked the passion as Christine's ardent suitor.  He actually looked a lot more like the part as an old man in the black & white images. <br /> <br />With the exception of Christine's singing parts in opera scenes, I was not expecting any operatic singing.  So I was actually surprised by the dramatic, evocative, and convincingly plausible singing performed by Rossum and Butler.  Webber's compositions are full of intricate transitions which require singers to sing in the wide range (high to low), and to carry the dynamics and the continuity of the music and lyrics at the same time.  So just the good singing really doesn't cut it.  Both actors did their parts so well in expressing their emotions and drama through their singing in addition to their eyes and motions.  By the way, to those who sing and/or play instruments, I highly recommend the soundtrack corresponding songbook published by Hal-Leonard, which includes the chart for \\"Learn To Be Lonely.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, this high quality production film would entertain many of the musical fans and the movie goers.   <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave were always going to be given a hard time. The following phrases plague audioslave <br />\\"Audioslave killed a good band\\" <br />\\"Rage against the machine/soundgarden were better\\" <br />etc. etc. <br />People always think about the former bands when they listen to a new super group like Velvet Revolver. Sure, compare them, but don't base them on the former bands. <br />Audioslave are actually as good as both soundgarden and rage in my opinion. They could do the funk metal riffs ratm used, do the grunge riffs soundgarden used, and use the power of cornells voice. <br />The first album was full of fat tunes, but it was very rage. The slower songs wern't, but it was definetly more than ratm than soundgarden in the recipe. However, it had a different quality about it, Audioslave. <br />The new album however, is more soundgarden than rage, but once again, still an independent band in its own right. <br />The songs are not all funky metal riffs (some still are), but a lot of it is more grunge. It still carries the audioslave forumla though. <br />Cornells voice isnt quite as nicely croakey as it was, but still powerful. Increased led zepplin influence too. <br />Your time has come - 7/10, a bit average. A bit like Bad seed. <br />Out of exile - 10/10 Fat riff, nice morello whammy pedal chorus. <br />Be yourself - 8/10 Like like a stone but better, slow, beautiful song. <br />Doesn't remind me - 5/10 Its good to see something different, but its a country song, good for the genre, but not my thing. <br />Drown me slowly - 10/10 Sounds like soundgarden quite a bit. Nice grunge riff for the chorus. <br />Heaven's dead - 8/10 Nice slow song. A bit like drive on the debut. <br />The Worm - 9/10 V. good song. Very fat bassy riff. <br />Man or animal - 7/10 bit average by audioslave standards. <br />Yesterday To Tomrrow - 7/10 Like drive and last remaining light. <br />Dandelion - 7/10 Another song with accoustic bits, its like... gentle rock. <br />#1 Zero - 7/10 Whammypedal song again. Good solo, but only appears to have one chorus. <br />The Curse - 7/10 Another \\"soft rock\\" song. <br />Like a song live bonus track - For those who have it. Accoustic version, so single notes are replace with chords. Its ok. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000099Y|4.0|nima, first of all, is hard to understand. Not story wise..what have you. It's a album that you can take in as a whole and see the incredibly long songs and tracks that mean nothing to the album (Useful idiot) and be disgusted by it. But you have to pretty much break down the tracks and digest it slowly to take on this new feel to it. It's a really great and heartfelt album. The kind of stuff Maynard USE to make. Anyway..I mainly made this comment to correct something that somebody said as a comment..and I quote: <br />\\"They are simply carbon copies of so many other nu-metal and alternative metal acts. Some synonyms for the word \\"Tool\\":  <br />NIN, Filter, Deftones, System of a Down, Korn, Drowning Pool, Disturbed, etc...(Shall I go on? I can.)\\" <br /> <br />Disturbed's first album came out in 2000. Tool's nima came out in 1996..any questions? Drowning Pool: to quote MTV \\"one of the most anticipated bands of the early 2000's\\"....once again..nima came out in 1996. So, of course, it makes perfect sense that Tool is a copy of bands that came out much later than them because they're all time travelers and can see what's big ahead of time. Sorry, but that had to be said because you are not well educated in music. Peace out <br />
B00005L94W|4.0|Fans of Kitano films such as Sonatine, Kikujiro, and the supremely excellent Fireworks/Hana-bi might find it hard to keep their hearts out of their mouths when listening to this CD, particularly the \\"Thanks for everything\\" track from Hana-bi.  But for the uninitiated (poor souls), the music is good enough to stand on its own.  The themes are simple, poignant, and expressed using the simplest means: some soaring strings, a little piano tinkle, and percussion that sounds somehow Japanese.  Much of it is synthesized and sounds like a karaoke-machine, but it is affecting nevertheless.  It ought to be sentimental--it comes very close, in fact--but ultimately I think Hisaishi's music succeeds in evoking genuine emotions.
B00004U8DV|5.0|\\"L.A. Woman\\" is the final album put together by the Doors before the death of Jim Morrison and what is so striking about it for me is how the two best tracks, the title one and \\"Riders of the Storm,\\" are so different from the rest of what is on the album. Contrasting the start of those tracks with the opening song on the album, \\"The Changeling,\\" and they are like night and day. Most of the rest of this 1971 album is really blues oriented, with \\"Love Her Madly\\" clearly being the best of the bunch, and some of the rest being instantly forgettable. I think it is obvious that the band was trying to get back their credibility after veering too far in the direction of pop for a couple of albums, with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and this one righting those wrongs. But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.<br /><br />My two favorite parts of Oliver Stone's movie \\"The Doors\\" is when we hear Ray Manzarek in the background fooling around on the organ until he gets the bit for \\"Light My Fire\\" right and the end credits with the tracking shot showing the record of \\"L.A. Woman,\\" with Val Kilmer's Morrison taking advantage of the great acoustics in the bathroom. For years when I was driving back from the Twin Cities and coming up the final hills before being able to see the lights of home, to wit the \\"city of lights,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" was the song I would play in the car because it perfectly suited the moment.<br /><br />Since the track opens with the sound of an accelerating car engine it is easy to see why the songs is associated with driving. Robbie Krieger simulates that sound on his guitar, but with a hint of eeriness that leads into first Manzarek's keyboards and then John Densmore's cymbal tapping and session player Jerry Scheff's throbbing bass. From that intriguing beginning the song generates its compelling rhythm and allows Morrison to wax lyrical. The bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history, using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\" makes his appearance. On a lot of these tracks Morrison's voice sounds about shot, but there are no complaints about \\"L.A. Woman,\\" which qualifies as his last great vocal performance.<br /><br />\\"Riders of the Storm\\" is one of the moodiest Doors' songs and the lyrics create a sense of foreboding (e.g., \\"Into this house were born/Into this world we're thrown\\") representing the questionable side of human existence. Musically Manzarek captures the sound of the storm, with actual thunderstorm sound effects dubbed on to the track, while Densmore again works the cymbals and Scheff provides a simple bass line, reflecting a minimalist approach that is quite effective. The song made it to #14 on the Billboard charts after Morrison's death in Paris (\\"Love Her Madly\\" had made it to #11 while the title track was just too long for AM radio). The \\"L.A. Woman\\" album only made it to #9, which, believe it or not, makes it the worst performance by a Doors album. Of course, a decade later Morrison and the Doors were bigger than ever and \\"L.A.

B0007OY2P8|3.0|Yes, this is a rather liberal adaptation and interpretation of Jane Austen's novel, but it's far from being terrible. <br />For those familiar with the novel, the director does choose to stress some elements differently, and the film as a whole is, quite literally, sexed up, but it doesn't really step beyond the boundaries of artistic licence. <br /> Northanger Abbey as a novel is already something of a curio, which is part of its charm. Almost twenty years on, this movie has become a curio too - it fits well with the book, and certainly enhanced my rereading of it. <br /> At times the soundtrack and the softcore fantasy scenes are a little overpowering, but they definitely have their place. <br />The casting didn't exactly jibe with my mental images, but all the actors turn in creditable performances, and the two leads do a very good job of being 'almost' attractive. <br /> If you know the book, don't be too hasty in dismissing this adaptation, it's a fun way to pass a couple of hours and you can always tear it apart at the end if you still feel the need to nitpick. <br /> If you don't know the book, then sit back and enjoy an 80s period piece about a dreamy young girl who has too many of the wrong ideas in her head.  <br /> Overall, the film does a good job of recreating Austen's gently mocking pastiche of a story, and although I wouldn't rush out and buy it, this film is definitely worth watching.
B00005OB0A|4.0|Kylie Minogue re-broke into pop stardom with \\"Fever,\\" her eighth studio album. And it's somehow not surprising -- \\"Fever\\" is infectious, dancey and perpetually catchy. Despite the \\"lovey\\" tone of the songs, Kylie's album is dancepop in its purest form, and is probably the best example of the type.<br /><br />It starts off on a rather middling note with the fast-paced \\"More More More,\\" before launching into the sparkling \\"Love At First Sight,\\" a more complex dance song that is surprisingly infectious. (\\"And everything went from wrong to right/the stars came up and filled up the sky/the music you were playin' nearly blew my mind/it was love at first sight!\\")<br /><br />Things coast on from there, including the infuritatingly entertaining \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" the funk-edged \\"Give It To Me,\\" and the sultry \\"Love Affair.\\" She also dabbles in softer electropop, in songs like the swoony \\"Fragile\\" and the swirling \\"In Your Eyes,\\" both of which turn down the tempo and up the emotion.<br /><br />It's always sort of nice when a guilty pleasure doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. And \\"Fever\\" has no such pretensions. It's a fun, slightly suggestive album that you can dance to, with the forgettable lyrics of dancepop, and some truly enjoyable beats that have a tendency to stick to your mind like old bubble gum.<br /><br />Even her most ardent fans can't claim that Kylie has a great voice -- she has a voice that is lightweight, wispy and pretty. It matches the music, and she knows how to use it, never overtaxing the ol' vocal chords. In other words, no Britney-style chord-straining yowls or screeches. Rather than exceptional vocal quality, Kylie gets props for knowing her limits, and working with them.<br /><br />And the dancepop of \\"Fever\\" also gets props for unusual complexity. Rather than repetitive beats repeated on every song, several songs from \\"Fever\\" switch tempo, switch synths, and have their highs and lows. There are some distinct flavours to some of the songs, such as funk and a bit of disco, which add extra spice and memorability.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" is a guilty pleasure, but at least it's a fun, entertaining one.

0142004235|5.0|I agree with other reviewers who said this was a life-changing novel.  In my estimation, this novel is second only to \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in terms of excellence. John Steinbeck has created characters that somehow never quite leave you, and a story that keeps you enthralled long after you have finished the novel.  If you are interested in seeing the movie, rent the 1981 remake with Jane Seymour, Timothy Bottoms, etc.  Although it seems a sacrilege to say it as the great James Dean was in the original, the remake is much better.  It follows the book faithfully and is able to explore themes that could not be explored in the 1950s.  Jane Seymour, at the height of her beauty, is utterly believable as the evil Kathy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, I've been a fan for a long time of Joss Whedon's writing.  <br />Irrevant, funny and biting all at once. He's the rare artist who can make you fall in love with a character one minute revile him the next and forgive right after that. One able to write plausible plot twists with unexpected consequences. In other words, he has vision. Something woefully lacking in the film and television arts these days.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend anything Joss Whedon has had a hand in (even though his Aliens 4 script was completely ruined and the film version of Buffy got sideswiped by the Donald who thought he could write better dialog because he just \\"didn't understand\\" what was written, they're still elements of Joss's vision in each), and to those who didn't like Buffy/Angel tv series, well, this is a completely different feel, MUCH more adult and a great story ready to be told.  <br /> <br />Can't wait to see the film \\"Serenity\\" and hope that, eventually, a network will pick up the show again and run with it!
1400049628|5.0|This book was entertaining as well as highly informative. Going into details about zombie attacks and classifying them by degree and class of outbreak. There are details about what should be done and shouldn't be, the advantages and disadvantages of weapons and battle tactics(if necessary) the main goal is survival and unlike in the movies, these zombies are the result of a viral outbreak, not some magic spell or demonic possession, these are zombies that won't stop coming until either they are destroyed or you end up being zombie chow. This book was written with a seriousness that's almost comical but terrifying when you think about it. And with what's going on these days, a sudden zombie outbreak wouldn't surprise me in the least.
0553212737|5.0|While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.  <br />I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it. If you are new to Austen then I recommend you start with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".

B0008G2IRO|4.0|I really liked the Gorillaz debut album, but I like this one better. It's certainly darker and more atmospheric, but no less catchy -- just a little more complex and unpredictable. I find this to be a lot more Danger Mouse than Blur (not that I know Danger Mouse beyond the Gray Album, and not that I was ever all that into Blur), but it's not really either.  <br /> <br />I think if you like Mr. Bungle and DJ Shadow, you might like this. It falls somewhere in between them in terms of intensity, and it's slicker than either, but like them, it's musically sophisticated, stoppy-and-starty, and not afraid to lurch from cool thing to cool thing.
B00005JNVS|5.0|I saw this movie on its debut in December 2004. I really didn't know what to expect. I mean I have seen Shaolin Soccer and have heard that Stephen Chow has invented his own movie genre in Hong Kong. So I went to see it and I was blown away. This Movie is like a live action \\"Anime\\" it has humour, awesome characters, and is hugely entertaining. Most people who don't like this movie were just not expecting this fantasy type Kung Fu film. This is not a down to earth old Jackie Chan Flick, this is a new Genre that you will either love or hate. I didn't really know what to expect when this movie hit the United States box office, I am overjoyed that it has gotten so much praise because Stephen Chow diserves it. I mean he is the Director, Writer, and Star of the movie. I just can't wait for his next film now.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I must say that I loved the 2nd season of The OC and I can't wait to have the DVD set so I can watch it whenever I want!!! I was very excited to find out that The OC will bo into season 3!! OH doing happy dance!!! I can't wait!!!!
0141301155|5.0|well everyone was and is talking about it, a movie is coming about it pretty soon, I thought it must be good so I read it and it's really fun. It's a world of wonderful imagination. Simply, it's one of the best children books you'll ever see.<br /><br />I get tired from reading all these heavy fantasies and adventures, having a rest with a children book like this one will litghen you up for sure.
B00097DX3U|5.0|After hearing this album it is clear that audioslave has become much more cohesive as a group.  It is no longer Cornell + Rage.  They have found a sound and it is a good one.  This album is an incredible second effort for these guys.  Chris's voice and lyrics are top notch as usual (though not as good his Soundgarden stuff, which is probably my favorite band) and Tom, Tim, and Brad are also playing superbly.  I was very happy to see Morello do more, longer, and better solos on this album because I think he was holding back on the last one and he is capable of doing better.  Every song on this album can hold its own.  My favs are probably your time has come, out of exile, doesnt remind me, and be yourself but I'll listen through the whole thing each time.  Again, this is a great album, it's better than the last and probably better than most albums in the last year or two.
0316172324|4.0|Nothing in Blink is groundbreaking, but it is illuminating.  While you may find everything here to be merely an expression of \\"common sense,\\" sometimes being reminded of the obvious has real value in that it re-focuses and re-emphasizes simple truths.  It is the loss of those simple truths - the inability to differentiate the meaningful facts from the overburdensome ones, the need to \\"slow things down\\" to give yourself enough \\"white space\\" to allow your intuitive skills to operate properly - that is at the core of the book.   <br /> <br />Most everything is presented anecdotally, and social scientists, psychologists, etc, will likely scoff at the presentation, even if the conclusions are correct.  But Gladwell is a business writer, and for the general/business reader, the anecdotes permit an identification with processes that may otherwise be overcomplicated.  Gladwell does a good job at tying what may otherwise appear to be disparate problems together and Blink is extremely readable. And the anecdotes are fascinating little stories on their own to boot - especially the section on the Pentagon's Millenium Challenge.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I would normally give this 2, maybe 2 1/2 stars- but i need to counter all those INSANE 5 star reviewers- IF YOU GAVE THIS 5 STARS YOUR NEW TO THIS BAND- AND DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM- THIS ALBUM IS NOT PROG- ITS CRAPPY METAL! BUY OLD DT- NOT THIS
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I like all of the other DT's a lot! But this one just doesnt cut it- i hope their new one is better! A LOT better
B0000524CY|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 8 and omg!  It scared the living daylight out of me.  Good special effects for such an old movie.  Wanna know what happens when a young girl is possesed by the devil?  Watch this horror and find out.  After this movie you cannot go near the stairs... you'll soon find out why!
B000002JPA|5.0|dont care what the new DT sounds like- will never touch this album!!!
B00004Y5A8|4.0|Great music, if you are a big Bowie fan you need this. If your not you just need SOME of this. One warning is there is an annoying DJ on both ends of some songs. I went to the preferences menu on iTunes and set the songs to end sooner or start later to cut the idiot off. But when he is talking over the music you can not really do this. So I knocked off a star for the DJ
B000002HPT|3.0|images and words is 5 stars- scenes maybe 5 also- 6 degress is 4- so this has to be 3- awake is 4- 4 1/2
B00062IVKS|3.0|I hate to be the heretic here but \\"Raging Bull\\" is a confused combination of four conflicting movies - none of which seem complete. 1) The first movie is a sports movie with great photography. It is a sequence of several boxing matches in chronological order. There are even subtitles to let the viewer know what year the match took place. It is well filmed but Scorcese knew that this was hardly a movie that would interest anyone but boxing fans with a long enough memory to recall who Jake LaMotta was so he added movie # 2) This is Scorcese's standard lower class Italian neighborhood film about lust, machismo, violence. Robert Deniro plays - Robert Deniro in his usual psychotic character/acting mode (doesn't DeNiro play the same character in every movie? Sure seems like it). See LaMotta lust after a beautiful woman, see him win the girl, see his temper ruin the relationship, see Deniro go psychotic and start beating up women. Ho-Hum. Let's move on to movie # 3) This is an attempt to portray athletes as olympian gods, complete with slow motion photography, operatic music, wide angle lenses. Leni Reifanstahl did it better in her German olympic films. What is odd here is that this has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. Is Lamotta a lowlife wife abuser? A dimwitted athlete? If so, what is the point of the idealizing film techniques? LaMotta is no candidate for deifying, so why all this unecessary trouble? Because it looks good? Maybe, but it has nothing to do with either of the films that have taken place so far. This brings us to film # 4) LaMotta gains weight, loses his family, gets arrested for statutory rape, ends up as a fourth rate entertainer in low class dives. The film ends abruptly and - astoundingly - a verse from scripture appears on the screen that suggests that LaMotta has been redeemed and has insight into his bad behavior. You wouldn't know it from anything that has taken place in the film up to that point. What redemption? What insight? Suddenly, the film wants to be a christian redemption story about an individual soul that turns from its evil ways. Huh? When did that happen? LaMotta didn't do this in the film or in real life, so what film was this the ending to?  What we have here are four different films stitched clumsily together. Scorcese seems unsure what he wants his film to be, so he does all four films and hopes the viewer never notices. I did. Was Scorcese's \\"Raging Bull\\" an historical boxing film?  A tale about a lower class guy who makes it big but hurts those who love him? An art film about athletes? A religious film?? Who knows? None of the parts gel together well. The result is a well filmed  jigsaw puzzle that has parts missing, that doesn't really know what it wants to be.  Unsatisfying as a whole; ok in parts.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I really don't know what to say about \\"With Teeth.\\" I mean, I'm a big NIN fan -- I'm not a disciple of Trent Reznor, but I've enjoyed most of the music the man has put together in the past 15 years. I think the problem is his downtime between albums. Five-plus years passed between \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile,\\" although, this did not seem so long because of how long TDS songs stayed on the scene (\\"Closer\\" still remains, and probably will for a long time) and because Reznor stayed busy, producing soundtracks and songs (such as the truly excellent \\"The Perfect Drug). The time between TF and \\"With Teeth\\" has been about as long, but Reznor not as prolific, and this simply builds anticipation for the album. People see albums as if they were fine wines: each added year of production means more layers of excellence. But this rarely holds true (fine, I'll give you Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\"), and when the album isn't stellar, that just adds to the disappointment.    Which brings us to \\"With Teeth.\\" It is not a stellar album, but it's a good one. I think there are five-six incredible tracks, with some good ones and some throwaways. That's not a bad track record for any album released since, say 1997, but from NIN people (including myself) expect more. But those few tracks are so good, I admit they skewed my rating up.    I'm a huge fan of the first single \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" I enjoy the fist-pumping beat, the throbbing early-90s synth and the politically charged lyrics. It was a breath of fresh air on the music scene: It showed all the revival synth-rock bands how to really get it done, how to ROCK, and I still haven't tired of it.     The albums's opener, \\"All the Love in the World\\" pummels you with its thunderous beats, but you have to wait almost three minutes for the payoff. The song begins with a tinkling piano line and Reznor's vocals, and new layers are slowly added in a powerful crescendo; the last 90 seconds are as powerful and anthemic as any NIN song, riding a techno beat and Reznor's howl. I admire Reznor's decision in this song to carry the first parts on his vocals -- there are very few artists bold enough to do this anymore, and Reznor must know at 39 (he's 40 now) his vocals are no longer as strong as they once were. The decision to push his sometimes wavering voice to the front shows the humanity and, dare I say, fragility of the man behind the machines.    I also enjoyed the cheesy, 808-bred drum beats of \\"Only,\\" which sounds completely out of place in the NIN canon. The same cannot be said for \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same,\\" which oozes anger and frustration over a synthed-out string section and rampant drums. It sounds as though it would have been right at home on either TDS or TF, but thankfully it's on \\"With Teeth,\\" adding some much needed punch and emotion.     Some other tracks sound good but just don't have panache. \\"Getting Smaller\\" is a good rocker with the old alternative soft-loud-soft dynamic. Reznor also revists the past with \\"Sunspots,\\" a song whose lyrics and music sound make it the missing link between TDS and TF. It's solid, but not remarkable, with no identity of its own.     Sadly, the rest of the album does not reach the level of these songs. \\"Love is Not Enough\\" is completely forgettable, a rarity for Reznor; the curiously pronounced refrain of the title track: \\"A-With-a Teeth-a\\" only adds to the awkward beats and sludgy guitars; \\"You Know What You Are\\" is worn out both sonically and vocally, an angry rant at some unknown \\"you\\" that may or may not be a person; and \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is just a mess or distortion in front of some raging Dave Grohl drums.    The closer, following the model of TDS, is an introspecitve, haunting, minimalistic number, \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\" The song rides a piano line made scarier by the fact it could be background music in a nursery. Reznor adopts a tender voice, singing quietly, and the volume amps up midway through, and we hear a screaming cacophony of fans in the background. \\"What if everything around you/ Isn't quite as it seems?\\" Reznor sings, as if questioning the validity of what he does and the sincerity of his fans' love.    It's a powerful lyrical moment on an album with few; that's possibly why THTF stood out for me. It's rousing chant of \\"Will you bite/The hand that feeds you/Will you stay/ Down on your knees\\" is as close as reznor comes to memorable refrains such as \\"I want to f*** you like an animal\\" or \\"Head like a hole/ Black as your soul ...\\"     Reznor still knows how to craft excellent songs that are both catchy and disturbing. He revisits his past to some success but he's also willing to experiment with structure, style and sound. Sometimes the experiments pay off, sometimes not. Here, probably only about half of With Teeth reflects his true talents. The off numbers are depressing, making you wonder why it took six years to craft them. But the other songs, the songs that show what Reznor can do, are astonishing sonic assaults that make you wish it hadn't been six years but even so you were glad to wait that long to hear them. Those pieces redeem the rest of the album.     Reznor has said he's already begun work compliling songs for a new album. If he builds on the momentum of the good stuff here, I shudder to think what he can do. It will be a fun (and hopefully brief) wait.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the best records I've ever heard. All the songs are good, but \\"Green Eyes\\",\\"Warning Sign\\" and especially \\"Clocks\\" are masterpieces. Highly,highly recommended!
B000063DHL|4.0|Of the first 5 Dickinson albums, this one seems to be the least popular overall.  And I suppose I agree, as it is likely my least favorite of the 5, but an album which isn't quite as good as those 4 ones can still be pretty damn good, as this album proves.  Not a good place too start with IM, I don't think, but still a very worthwhile album.<br /><br />This albums biggest problem is the production.  It's a bit muddled, and the guitar tone is really lousy.  IM never exactly had the most bonecrunching guitar tone around, but it was always a lot better than the shapeless, incredibly trebly and glam-metal esque guitar tone they use on this album.  Also, the synths they use tend to be a bit cheesy, but this was pretty unavoidable at the time.  (The use of guitar synths also exacerbates the guitar tone problem, and the general muddled feel of the production.)  Still, even if the production were better, this wouldn't be as good as 4 aforementioned albums.  The songwriting just isn't quite as good.<br /><br />'Lost Somewhere in Time' is a classic speed metal opener, but with an epic twist, in the form of the extended middle break.  A good opener, classic Maiden stuff.  'Wasted Years' is the radio song of the album, but it's still a good track.  The opening lick/riff is totally great and unforgettable, and it's just  a fast paced, fun and catchy song.  It's pretty cheesy, but in a good way, as Maiden generally is. (Still, it can't match 'Can I Play With Madness' in terms of fun cheesiness)  'Sea of Madness' is one of those tracks that took a long time to grow on me.  Truthfully, the instrumental work on the song still doesn't interest me particularly, but it has got a great, soaring chorus.  'Heaven Can Wait' seems like it would be a power-ballad, but it isn't.  It's very fast and energetic, even by Maiden standards, with a frenetic vocal performance from Bruce.  Again, the chorus, is very cheesy, particularly the synths, but it totally works anyway.  The slower middle break is fun too, particularly the dramatic 'oh-oh-oh' stuff.  'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' is one of the most underrecognized IM songs.  It's not one of the very best ones, but it is a classic, with perhaps the most over the top, grandiose chorus they ever wrote.  Instrumentally it's strong too, with some stunning harmony leads, and solid triplet driven riffwork.  'Stranger in a Strange Land' is a ballad.  Instrumentally, it isn't particularly interesting, but Bruce's powerful voice carries the day, and it's really quite dramatic and atmospheric.  Not one of their very best songs, but still an interesting track, and it does have a nice and appropriate, other-worldly feel.  'Deja Vu' is another overlooked track, this time rightfully so, but it's certainly far from worthless.  Just another standard Maiden rocker, but it's got a nice main lick and a memorable chorus, so it's fairly worthwhile, even though it hasn't go too much else.  'Alexander the Great' is the closing epic, and it's perhaps the weakest epic of Maiden's first seven albums.  Again, however, those songs hold a very high standard, so this is another very enjoyable song.  It can be a bit meandering at times, particularly in the intro and the middle break, but the core of the song is quite strong.<br /><br />Yeah, I like this.  Amusing album art, too.is fun too, particularly the dramatic 'oh-oh-oh' stuff.  'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' is one of the most underrecognized IM songs.

0440180295|5.0|In the novel Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, The life of a soldier, Billy Pilgrim, in World War 2 is portrayed through misery, suffering, and self realization. Throughout the story, however, Billy, travels in time after discovering the secrets of time travel from an alien world called Tralfamadore. In one paragraph of the story, he could be a P.O.W. in World War 2. In another, he could be back home in Illium, Illinois. However in chronological order, after fighting in the war, Billy finds himself back at optometry school where he marries a woman named Valencia. Later on Billy describes his ubduction by aliens in which he is displayed in a zoo like environment. When Billy returns to Earth he becomes the only survivor in a plane crash. Ironically, his wife dies soon after. Throughout the telling of Billy's Story, told by a character named Yon Yonsen introduced at the beginning of the novel, Billy's life shows how easy it is to  remember and how hard it is to forget. And that even though our pasts might be difficult, we still have to recognize them and embrace them in order to learn more about ourselves during the present. Overall I enjoyed this book a great deal because of the authors realistic descriptions and interesting look into the meaning of time.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Well, this is easily the best SOAD album.  Yes, it's definitely more melodic and polished than their previous two albums, but that's what SOAD needs to do.  Sorry, but mainstream hard rock/metal and Nu-metal bands just can't hope to rock as effectively as, say, thrash or death metal bands can, so they gotta focus on songwriting and memorability.  Fortunately, two things which 'Mezmerize' definitely has.  On top of having just better melodies and uniformly excellent choruses, this albums sees a return of some of the quirkiness of their debut, which was partially lacking in 'Toxicity'.  Daron does do a lot more singing this time around, and here he tends to actually sing, rather than just yowl like a sick old woman. (Though he still does that some.)  I think this helps a lot, particularly the harmonies that are used continuously throughout the album, and he just works well with Serj in general.  However, he does have an... odd voice, and I suppose I can understand why some people would really dislike him.<br /><br />After the intro 'Mezmerize' has only 10 tracks, but it's more solid and lacks the bits of filler that clogged 'Toxicity' and their debut.  'BYOB' you've doubtless all heard, but it is an excellent song and a very good opener.  It's got some of their most sudden, dramatic tone changes, and, gasp, guitarwork that is actually interesting to listen to. (Something virtually unheard of in mainstream hard rock).  'Revenga' is probably my favorite track.  The verses aren't so great, but they do provide an excellent contrast to the smooth, hypnotic chorus.  The dramatic middle break is awesome too, and totally makes the song.  This track is very similar to the later 'Violent Pornography', which is almost equally strong, and with a more epic, triumphal chorus.  'Cigaro' and 'This Cocaine...'  are both quick moving, brief numbers.  'Cigaro' is very good, with a pounding, groovy chorus and nicely eccentric vocal performance, whereas 'This Cocaine...' is decent, but unremarkable.  The guitarwork is pretty good, but the vox are fairly unintriguing.  The parodic 'Radio/Video' has got fun verses, with an amusing pseudo-polka beat complete with accordion synth, and swirling, intertwining twin vocal lines.  Not a true standout, bu stilla very solid track.  'Question!' is a balladish track, and a nicely done one, if, perhaps slightly generic.  'Sad Statue' is more of a rocker, with some energetic guitarwork, but it breaks down to a very sad, slow burning chorus.  Good stuff.  'Old School Hollywood' is a synth-laden joke track, and while it isn't anything to be taken seriously, nor one of the stronger tracks, it's sufficiently amusing, in its way.  'Lost in Hollywood' is a great closer.  Daron comes to the forefront vocally, with Serj  harmonizing extensively underneath, and with droning, minimalist instrumental support.  A very strange track, unlike anything else I've heard from them, but it's a strangely affecting ballad, in spite of the sometimes odd lyrics.<br /><br />Lastly, lots of people have complained about the lyrics, so I'll tell you the secret of song lyrics: They don't matter.  Sure, you can let the lyrics effect how you enjoy something to a degree, but to let them bother you enough that you can't enjoy something is just silly.  (And, liking crappy music simply because it has lyrics you like is equally stupid.) Furthermore, despite what many have said, most of these songs do mean something, they just sometimes use a banal veneer to express their (satirical) point.

0316172324|5.0|I breezed through this one.  It could have been condensed into a long article but is worth it none the less.  I think it is both provocative and thought provoking.  I particularly like d the idea that a relationship of many years can be summed up in a matter of minutes by people trained to do so.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is NOT for children or those with a weak mind, stomach, or heart.  Those who are out of touch with reality, please do NOT watch this movie.  Take this for what it is..a COMEDY!!!  You will be laughing within the 1st 5 minutes.  I rented this movie because I needed a laugh...it isn't what I got..I got TOO MANY laughs!!!  I don't know if it was that you could see the strings on the puppets, how they walked, how they talked, or the situations they were making fun of.  No matter what it was, it was HILARIOUS.  The original songs,  HILARIOUS.   This movie will be added to my DVD collection!!!!!!
B00008S2VG|4.0|It's sad that some people find the time to log on to Amazon with different screen names in order to give this album a bad review. I used to think most of the Madonna haters were right wing Christians, but now I realize that they are just fans of other singers who haven't been as successful as Madonna. American Life ONLY screws up on the title track. Other than that, there is some really good music here. Oh..and for Madonna being \\"over with....\\" LOL! She played to stadium crowds of 70,000 people in each city she played in.
0893815187|5.0|This collection of works is undoubtedly a seminal work for contemporary fine art photography.  Sally Mann's print work is without a doubt some of the most competant and breathtaking I have ever seen.  Her scenes are rich with subtle tones and almost ethereal luminance that captivates the viewer.  I would not be surprised if she is remembered as much for her printing as she is for the controversial subject matter.   <br /> <br />The book deals with childhood in a very honest unashamed way.  This is problematic for some viewers who think that pictures with children should only portray their happiest moments.  This subject matter may not be suitable for the rigid-minded and certainly will be unpleasant for those who believe children, unlike the rest of humanity, can only be presented as cheerful little sprites.  The book challanges the viewer and brings up issues of how our cultures representations of female sexuality are interpreted and acted out by young girls.  Beyond that it refuses to entertain the idea that nudity in children is necesarily harmful and exploitative.  These issues are broached in a beautiful, delicate way.  The lives of her children are portrayed honestly and respectfully as she sees them through her lens.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Poor Mariah...she has faded so bad that this album has flopped worldwide. She is a glorified dog whistle. The only good song on this album is \\"We Belong Together.\\" Other than that, don't bother.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Don't listen to the people who like to hear themselves talk about how this album is sub-standard. Chris Cornell shines in his own way as usual and the past Rage Against the Machine members are also strong throughout. The writing is solid and the chemistry between the members of the band is evident. <br /> <br />In the past I was more of a Soundgarden fan than a Rage fan. Trust me, there's no sense in comparing this group to the past bands. This is a good album in it's own right and yes, even if they weren't past members of these bands this CD would still get looked at. Why? Chris is a unique and distinct vocalist. So are his lyrics. Tom Morello is a unique and distinct guitarist. You can't get around that.  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the genre and if you are at all a fan of the previous album then you should definitely pick this one up. If you aren't familiar with these guys, pick it up and get back in touch with your rock and roll roots.  <br /> <br />From one person who likes good rock and roll to another or to someone still getting into it, check it out. And let yourself enjoy it free of comparisons and reviews rife with obnoxious vocabulary.
B00005JNTV|5.0|Movies derived from comic books are not exactly the easiest to make. Directors and writers have to know the boundaries of their characters. Remaining faithful to the source material is key. And if they do cross the line, they'll be feeling the wrath of every aggravated 18-34 year old, memorabilia collecting, Klingon fluent fan-boy for years.<br /><br />It does help however when the writer of the film happens to be the author and creator of the comic book being derived from. What makes it even better is getting a director who is a fan-boy himself. This is exactly what happened in the case of Sin City.<br /><br />Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids) had been badgering legendary comic book writer/artist Frank Miller for years to bring his most cherished series to the big screen. After much pestering and a secret audition featuring Josh Hartnett (which is used for the opening of the film), Miller was convinced to green-light the project. In fact, Rodriguez was so hell-bent on staying true to the comic that he actually resigned from The Directors' Guild of America just to allow Miller to be credited as Co-Director.<br /><br />Translating the books to screen rather than adapting them, Rodriguez used all of Miller's original artwork as storyboards. Filmed entirely on green screen with digital cameras, the results are nothing short of amazing. The shadowy characters, the gritty cityscapes, the violence, the signature rain, the chain-smoking, the black and white film noir influences, the minimalist usage of bright colors -- and yes, even severed body parts - appear just as Miller had envisioned.<br /><br />The movie boasts an impressive, all-star ensemble cast which includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Mickey Rourke, Jaime King, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro. Perhaps the reasoning behind this much star power is that each story is of its own entity. Yet, the tales are seamlessly intertwined and the film paces well.<br /><br />In the first entry \\"That Yellow Bastard\\", Willis is a haggard cop battling a pedophile (Stahl). The role seems to be tailor-made for Willis who gives it just the edge it needs. Sure his portrayal may be stereotypical at times, but he makes it work with ease.<br /><br />\\"The Hard Goodbye\\" is probably the most enjoyable story. Buried under layers of prosthetics, Mickey Rourke is at the top of his game as Marv, a tough-as-nails bruiser who sets out to avenge the death of his hooker girlfriend Goldie (King). When he ends up at the house of a mute cannibal (Wood), the sadomasochistic madness ensues in the most ridiculous of fashions.<br /><br />The third segment \\"The Big Fat Kill\\", though way over-the-top, features some of the most memorable moments of the film. Clive Owen plays Dwight, a good guy trying to cover up the death of a crooked cop (Del Toro) in order to preserve a negotiation of power between the law and a town run by hookers (led by Rosario Dawson). Keep your eyes open for an intense car scene directed by Rodriguez's good friend, the master of front seat dialogue himself: Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />Shot and cut entirely by Rodriguez, Sin City is a triumph. The splashes of color and it's pulpy, film noir style are both abrasive and dazzling. Combined with Miller's sensationally slick dialogue, the result is a beautiful and timeless classic, which will undoubtedly be shown in future film schools for many years to come. Fan-boys rejoice. Robert Rodriguez is on your side.Yellow Bastard\\", Willis is a haggard cop battling a pedophile (Stahl). The role seems to be tailor-made for Willis who gives it just the edge it needs.

When he ends up at the house of a mute cannibal (Wood), the sadomasochistic madness ensues in the most ridiculous of fashions.     The third segment \\"The Big Fat Kill\\", though way over-the-top, features some of the most memorable moments of the film. Clive Owen plays Dwight, a good guy trying to cover up the death of a crooked cop (Del Toro) in order to preserve a negotiation of power between the law and a town run by hookers (led by Rosario Dawson). Keep your eyes open for an intense car scene directed by Rodriguez's good friend, the master of front seat dialogue himself: Quentin Tarantino.    Shot and cut entirely by Rodriguez, Sin City is a triumph. The splashes of color and it's pulpy, film noir style are both abrasive and dazzling. Combined with Miller's sensationally slick dialogue, the result is a beautiful and timeless classic, which will undoubtedly be shown in future film schools for many years to come. Fan-boys rejoice. Robert Rodriguez is on your side.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is AIC's masterpiece album, 1992's Dirt, one of the finest hard rock albums that i have EVER had the pleasure of hearing. Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell capture their mood perfectly on this recording that sometimes it can be difficult just to absorb it all...ok not really, it just rocks to hard NOT to listen to it all, it contains Rooster afterall, my pick for THE song of the 90's, a beautiful ode to Cantrells Vietnam vet father, Cantrell captures the mood and frustration that a soldier would be feeling wrapped up in a 6 minute hard rock classic.

The relationship between Landon and Jamie is very sad because she is ill. I have also seen the movie but I like the book more because it is not exactly the same.  <br />I understand the feeling of the young people better while reading than while watching.  <br />Read it by yourself because it is one of the best books, which I have ever read.  <br />by steffi
B00097DX3U|4.0|<br />Out Of Exile is for Audioslave what There Is Nothing Left To Lose was for the Foo Fighters. Audioslave's classic was their debut effort, whilst The Colour And The Shape was an effort that the Foo Fighters will find hard difficult to ever topple. I had a feeling Audioslave would struggle to find material to rival their first effort, however this is an album I feel will grow on me overtime and could well spawn an impressive array of hits although at this early stage it lacks the longetivity of \\"Audioslave\\" <br /> <br />Song Review List <br /> <br />YOUR TIME HAS COME: Straight up and down rocker to kick off proceedings. Quite catchy in places and should generate some airplay on some sporting shows in Australia. Show Me How To Live remains one of the most heavily played songs on Sports Tonight and this one has its place with rising stars as a motivational piece. Far from complex but effective. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />OUT OF EXILE: Interesting piece that is solid, however is not destined for any greatness despite being quite interesting musically. Whilst these are only my early impressions I cannot see this one growing on me. 7/10 <br /> <br />BE YOURSELF: My first impressions of this song were not overly positive as I felt the band were holding back and they could have done a little better in terms of delivery. The song grows on you after a number of listens (fantastic intro) and the bass lines and guitar work from Morello is first class. The song has received very little airplay in Australia as yet. Flows with the mainstream but is a great song nevertheless. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />DOESN'T REMIND ME: Radio listeners could take up to one minute to work out that this is an Audioslave song. Must be considered as being experimental for the band with it's bluesy, country and power ballad feel in places. Could be Coldplay and sounds a little like \\"I fought the law and the law won\\". Potential hit. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />DROWN ME SLOWLY: First impressions were that this song would be at home on Superunknown. Morello really works the guitar on this tune and when it slows down I am waiting for Neil Finn to belt out \\"Everywhere you go always taking weather with you\\". Is not a bad song and has a fair bit to like about it, but hard to see this one ending up on the \\"Best Of Audioslave\\" 7/10 <br /> <br />HEAVENS DEAD: Above average ballad where Cornells voice works well. This one feels like a classic in patches and is structurally a beautiful and well crafted song. The bass and guitar work well on this song. Another potential hit given enough airplay. 8/10 <br /> <br />THE WORM: Fair song, however I found the Morello's solo to be over the top on this one. Solid but forgettable 6.5/10 <br /> <br />MAN OR ANIMAL: Fast paced tune, excellent bass and guitar work throughout (the solo is a little out of place here though) and the song is a likely \\"grower\\". Brings me back to Superunknown again. 7/10 <br /> <br />YESTERDAY TO TOMORROW: Just feels like an average song that has potential but fails to rise to the occassion. Hard to be overly critical either but this song does nothing for me. 6/10 <br /> <br />DANDELION: A catchy tune with a more realistic solo here from Morello. This song for Audioslaves ability probably is their bread and butter fair. (Filler for most others band)7/10 <br /> <br />#1 ZERO: Bluesy, catchy, mysterious with Cornell in fine form. The transitional period in the song is very powerful, however again the solo is on the overdone side. This song has so much potential but something is missing that is the difference between major hit material and just another good Audioslave song. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />THE CURSE: Solid song to end proceedings and although it doesn't reach any great heights the guitar solo is more suited to the tone of the song and it certainly has its moments. 7/10 <br /> <br /> <br />HIGHLIGHTS: <br /> <br />Be Yourself, Doesn't Remind Me, Heavens Dead, #1 Zero <br /> <br />Commerfords bass, Wilk's excellent performancethroughout.  <br /> <br />SOLID <br /> <br />Your Time Has Come, Out Of Exile, Drown Me Slowly, The Worm, Man Or Animal, Dandelion, Yesterday To Tomorrow, The Curse <br /> <br />CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR <br /> <br />No one doubts Morello ability with the guitar and he remains one of the best in the business, however in patches album the solos are overplayed. Maybe on the next album he could take a leaf out of Cobains book and make his guitar playing gel with the song and become another voice.  <br /> <br />Overall: I have no doubt this album will grow on me, however it lacks the depth displayed in the first effort. There is evidence of brilliance throughout, however some songs are just lacking something to take them to the next level. There are numerous classics here but it is a shame they are not in the one song. I would say I need to give this one more time as the review was compiled on one listen only. <br /> <br />3.5 stars.... <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is the only new show this season, I would say,that is worth watching. I started watching it because of Patrick Dempsey,who has evolved nicely since the mid-80's. Sandra Oh is also proving that she is a very versatile actress. I think she is just terrrific. The sad thing is is the season ended too soon.
B00005RHGK|2.0|I agree with a previous reviewer.  This movie started out great but just fizzled in the end.  Actually, it ran out of gas about the same time that Darry and Trish's car ran out of gas less than halfway through he film.  That is where we get the diner scene that is a ripoff of Duel, and the introduction of the psychic character who dragged the story down.  Shortly thereafter we get a glimpse of the sci fi (not horror) looking beast and we're ready for the credits to roll to save us from wasting any more time.
6304779356|5.0|In 1987, director Joel Schumacher had unleashed a whole new generation of vampires. This movie has it all: Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Action, and most importantly: Horror. This film is entitled, THE LOST BOYS. <br /> <br />    LUCY EMERSON (played by Dianne Wiest) is moving, from Phoenix, to Santa Carla, CA, with her two sons, MICHAEL (played by Jason Patric) and SAM (played by Corey Haim), after going through a legal divorce from her husband. They are moving in with Lucy's loveable father (played by Barnard Hughes). That night, while on the boardwalk, Michael and Sam are at a live concert, where Tim Cappello is performing. There, he sees the beautiful STAR (played by Jami Gertz), who is accompanied by a ten-year-old kid named, LADDIE THOMPSON (played by Chance Michael Corbit). He begins chasing after her, as Sam enters a comic book shop on the boardwalk. In the comic book shop, Sam meets EDGER (played by Corey Feldman) & ALLEN FROGG (played by Jamison Newlander), the Frogg brothers. <br /> <br />    The next night on the boardwalk, Michael officially meets Star. As Star is about to go for a ride with Michael on his motorcycle, four guys named, DAVID (played by Kiefer Sutherland), PAUL (played by Brooke McCarter), DWAYNE (played by Billy Wirth), & MARKO (played by Alexander Winter). Leading this gang is David himself. After some force, Star winds up on the backseat of David's bike, as well as being accompanied by Laddie. They invite Michael off to their hideout cave, where David offers Michael a sip of wine, which turns out to be...blood.  <br /> <br />    Over the next few days, Michael begins acting strange: he sleeps all day, he wears sunglasses in the house, and his fingernails seem to be getting a bit too long. Seems as though Michael is becoming a vampire. If he his becoming a vampire, then how is he able to walk about in the day light? Well, Star informs Michael that he, Star, and Laddie are only half of what David, Paul, Marko, & Dwayne are. She tells himthis after Michael was taken to a camp ground rendevous where David and his guys have their late-night snake. <br /> <br />    Sam realizes that MAX (played by Edward Herrman), Lucy's boss at the video store might be the head vampire. His reasons are simply this: He does not show up for work until dark. His dog, Thorn, had viciously attacked Lucy during the day when Lucy was dropping off a bottle of wine to Max. But it seems as though Max may not be the head vampire. Sam, Edgar, Alan, and Michael decide to take care of this matter before it gets any worse. The Frogg brothers kill of Marko, but are unable to kill the other three since David chased them out of the cave, practically killing them. They take Star and Laddie back to Sam and Michael's house, but they are no longer safe. <br /> <br />    That night, Sam, Edgar, Allen, and Michael battle David, Paul, and Dwayne. Edgar, Allen, and Sam's dog, Nanook, kill Paul. Sam kills Dwayne. Michael kills David. But, Michael is still pretty much a vampire. Seems as though the head vampire is still on the loose. <br /> <br />    Featuring an awesome killer soundtrack, THE LOST BOYS, is a thrill-ride for people of all ages. I have enjoyed this film very much and I will never get tired of it. Kiefer Sutherland never fails as an actor. He just continues to be the best actor known to the world.
B00005RYL9|4.0|They have lived secretly among us for millenniums; near immortals who can only be killed if their heads are severed from their bodies. They move through time discovering each other - sometimes making alliances, and other times chopping off each other's heads, and waiting for the time of the Gathering, when those few who remain will be inexplicably drawn to New York City for a final struggle over a nebulous prize with only one victor left standing.<br />When you write out the plot of `Highlander' like that, it is hard to avoid seeing just how silly it all sounds. There is no explanation for what set this game of immortals in motion, or why any one person in any given time is born an immortal. The prize the immortals seek  - described at one point as having knowledge of what everyone is thinking, and being able to advise presidents and scientist while you have children and grow old,  sounds more like the career track of a successful but harried think tank consultant than something that one would struggle and kill for down through the ages. It is best not to think too deeply on these things while watching the movie.<br />The holes in the plot are well matched by the single-note acting on display. Christopher Lambert, in the title role of Macleod the immortal highlander, broods. Sean Connery playing the foppish but wise Ramirez, Macleod's immortal mentor, hams it up. And Clancy Brown plays the film's villian, the Kurgan - part demon warrior incarnate and part anti-social bad boy, so far over the top that he is a hilarious treat to watch. The rest of the performances are mostly forgettable, excepting Beatie Edney as Heather, the bonnie love of Macleod's youth - she is much too enticing to be forgotten.<br />The magic of `Highlander' is that despite all of this, it works, and it works well. When the paper thin plot and clich&eacute;d acting combine with the movie's lively action scenes, flashbacks through time, and driving Queen Soundtrack, it all gels together as a thrillingly unique action adventure fantasy that draws you into its internal logic and makes you forget all of its flaws while you revel in its hammy performances. I have watched it many times over the years and it has manages to capture my imagination each time. Like the origin of the immortals and their quest, there is no good explanation for this - it just is.<br />Make no mistakes - `Highlander' is a silly B movie, but one that is as exciting and as much fun as any B movie that has ever been made. Watch it and enjoy it as such, and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Theo Logosn adventure fantasy that draws you into its internal logic and makes you forget all of its flaws while you revel in its hammy performances.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I really enjoy these discussions and this wondeful film. It is totally about love. It's such a magical film like some people have written. <br /> <br />I'm a Lesbian but this movie makes sense even to me. Nicole is so beautiful and Ewan is so charming. <br /> <br />I love this film.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I first heard \\"SHUT UP!\\" while I was bowling with my cousins. Who, in the course of their life hasn't had a boss, or a teacher, or someone they would love to play that song for? I loved every song on this album. To the people who don't like Simple Plan, you are certainly entitled to your opinion. I personally would recommend this cd to anyone to listen to just once. If they like it, then I'd recommend buying it. I bought it just for the song \\"SHUT UP!\\" I can tell you, I've got a list of people I'd love to play that song for. Great cd!

B00004ST9Q|5.0|This DVD is a collection of MTV style music videos, live performances, and selected additional material including interviews and \\"making of\\" segments.  It is a DVD you can watch over and over.  I see and hear something new every time I watch it.    Whitney Houston has never been a great stage performer, but her voice and her music are powerful, soulful and personal.  Her music has seemed to reflect her personal life in ways which are sometime haunting, sometimes tinged with sadness, but always beautiful.  \\"Its Not Right But Its OK\\", \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", \\"I Will Always Love You\\" hold such deeply intense meaning for this performer.  Perhaps her success stems from the fact that she can bring such emotion to the songs she chooses.  American Idol contestants and other wannabees...take note!      Given her recent personal difficulties, the music takes on an even more intensely personal tone.  When I watch the live performance of \\"Didn't We Almost Have it All?\\" she I have the sense that she is speaking to someone who isn't in the audience.  You wonder if she was aware that she was perhaps foreshadowing events in her life.  In \\"Step By Step\\", she goes back to her gospel roots and gives a great performance.      The segments on this DVD sample the range of music...from pop to R&B to gospel...that Whitney Houston has masterfully navigated through her career.     I hope one day she will share her voice with us again and perform many of these songs that may have deeper meaning for her...and us...now more than ever.
0800141628|4.0|In 1986, Stephen King's short story entitled, THE BODY, was brought to life in the format of a movie entitled, STAND BY ME. This is a movie everyone has enjoyed. There is action, adventure, drama, and comedy fused into one movie that stands as another timeless classic. <br /> <br />    Four 12-year-old friends, GORDY LACHANCE (played by Wil Wheaton), CHRIS CHAMBERS (played by the late, River Phoenix), TEDDY DUCHAMP (played by Corey Feldman), & VERN TESSIO (played by Jerry O'Connell) are spending a harmless summer together in the 1950s. They hear the news of a boy who has been missing for some time now. So, they set out to find the boy. During their long journey, they encounter some scary obstacles, which include a ferocious dog, bloodsucking leeches, not to mention, a train. While on their way to this supposedly missing kid, they are being trailed by a gang of bullies. Leading the gang is ACE MERRILL (played by Kiefer Sutherland). They find the boy they are looking for, but there is one small detail that I forgot to mention: The boy was killed. <br /> <br />    I was not all too impressed with this movie, except for Kiefer's outstanding portrayal of bad boy ACE MERRILL. The movie is enjoyable in many ways and I would consider it a classic. It has been a long time since I have seen this film. I am thinking of digging it out and putting on just to see if I will like it better than I did when I had first seen it so long ago. But, I would strongly recommend it to all of ya out there.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I haven't written a review for a movie yet because we see so many of them, but this one deserves it. <br /> <br />I agree that this is one movie people or either going to hate it or love it. The humor is simple and subtle, which to me is where this movie's charm is, but the humor is definately there if you're into this sort of thing.  And if you're like me, tired of all the over-the-top plot lines, so-called humor, and computer graphic imaging, this movie is a breath of fresh air (note the tacky Casio playing in the background.  Hilarious). <br /> <br />We all have been there.  High school was uncomfortable enough, but the kids who were die hard goofballs, and they didn't even see it in themselves, were the ones that had it the roughest.  The main 3 main characters in this cute little movie were those kids we all new in high school.  The sweetness of this movie comes from how their friendship develops and where it leaves them.  If you read into it, it tells us the story of by sticking and working together, we can overcome everything. If we have hopes and dreams, they will come true. We should all be so lucky to have friends like Napolean, Pedro, and Deb. <br /> <br />Throw in the equally goofy secondary characters, relax,and take this movie for exactly what it is, you can have a laugh riot.  This held true even for this forty-something and her husband. <br /> <br />Finally, what I loved about this movie is that I didn't have to be afraid to watch it with my 15 and 9 year old sons.  Our 15 year old appreciated it because he's currently living it, his mom and dad appreciated it because they have lived it, and the nine year old loved it just for its pure goofiness.  No swearing, no sex.  Just a good time, with a really sweet ending. Catching bass and chatting online with babes all day could possibly fulfill our dreams.
B00080ZG10|5.0|For years, Martin Scorsese has been unfairly overlooked by the Academy Awards (GoodFellas losing out to Dances with Wolves?!). He is the perennial Hollywood outsider. In recent years, the veteran filmmaker seems to become aware of this slight and, like one of his contemporaries, Steven Spielberg, has tried to make more Academy friendly films with Gangs of New York and more recently, The Aviator. Despite the presence of Michael Mann as producer and Leonardo DiCaprio as his leading man, the Oscar has alluded Scorsese yet again.<br /><br />With recent strong performances in Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of New York, Leonardo DiCaprio has finally managed to distance himself from the Titanic phenomenon. With The Aviator, he delivers his strongest, most textured performance to date. He captures the tycoon's intensity with a piercing stare and a tough, no compromising attitude.<br /><br />Not since New York, New York has Scorsese crafted such a lavish homage to classic Hollywood cinema. The opulent set of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub that Hughes frequents in The Aviator evokes the glitzy clubs of New York, New York.<br /><br />Scorsese paints a fascinating portrait of this complex individual, his triumphs and his flaws with a vivid brush. It may seem that the director has moved away from intimate, personal movies but this is because the larger-than-life subject is reflected in the film's grandiose style. Scorsese has lost none of his passion. This is hardly a movie done by a filmmaker on autopilot. The Aviator is a finely crafted, entertaining biopic that is ambitious but wisely doesn't try to cram Hughes' entire life into one movie, instead focusing on a specific period of time. DiCaprio and Scorsese present an unsentimental portrait which probably didn't endear it with the Academy but this makes for a much more interesting film.<br /><br />On disc one there is an audio commentary by Martin Scorsese, Thelma Schoonmaker and Michael Mann. Scorsese dominates the track with the occasional comments by Schoonmaker and Mann. This is an engrossing, informative track that fleshes out Hughes' backstory.<br /><br />The second disc features a deleted scene in which Hughes tells Ava Gardner about how, years ago, he accidentally killed a man with his car and paid his family $20,000 to keep quiet. It is an oddly poignant moment of regret that further humanizes Hughes.<br /><br />\\"A Life without Limits: The Making of The Aviator\\" is a featurette/press kit comprised of standard soundbites from the cast mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History\\" features Hughes biographers talking about how the man developed a love of aviation from an early age. Hughes was always willing to risk his vast fortune to realize his dreams. These biographers also talk about the man's numerous innovations and records that he set.<br /><br />A nice follow-up to this extra is a 43-minute History Channel documentary entitled, \\"Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes.\\" This is an excellent look at his life, complete with archival footage and photos.<br /><br />\\"The Affliction of Howard Hughes: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\" takes a look at how the disorder went undiagnosed when Hughes was alive.<br /><br />This is followed by \\"OCD Panel Discussion with Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese and Hughes' Widow Terry Moore.\\" The actor talks about how he got into Hughes' mindset and portrayed OCD realistically and not with some simple imitation.<br /><br />\\"An Evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda\\" is a Q&A session done after a screening of the movie. DiCaprio talks about how he got interested in Hughes' life and about the evolution of the project, from the early stages with Michael Mann to finally making the movie with Scorsese. This is an entertaining, engaging extra.<br /><br />There are two featurettes that explore the visual effects and production design of The Aviator. Some insight is given into how two of the film's impressive actionset pieces-the making of Hell's Angels and the crash landing of the spy plane--were achieved through a mix of model-work and CGI. Legendary production designer, Dante Ferretti talks about how he indulged his love of classic Hollywood by recreating its most glamourous period for this movie. All the sets were hand-built and with no CGI at all.<br /><br />There are also two featurettes that briefly touch upon the costuming and make-up work for the movie. Both aspects helped recreate the beautiful actresses that Hughes encountered during the early part of his career. Great lengths were taken to recreate the look of the period with many old photos and films studied to get just the right look.<br /><br />\\"Scoring The Aviator: The Work of Howard Shore\\" briefly examines how this veteran composer set about scoring this movie.<br /><br />\\"The Wainwright Family - Loudon, Rufus and Martha\\" is an unnecessary extra that takes a quick look at this musical family who all had cameos as musicians performing in the Cocoanut Grove nightclub during various time periods.<br /><br />Finally, there is a 10 minute montage of behind-the-scenes photographs.film's impressive action set pieces-the making of Hell's Angels and the crash landing of the spy plane--were achieved through a mix of model-work and CGI.

B00004Z459|3.0|this cd caused a major fuss when it was first released, it was kind of an underground group until everyone started buying the cd a few weeks after its release.  I will start off by giving props to this cd, because it was the second cd I got after Limp Bizkit's CS and the HD flavored W, but like all things, those obsessions went away quickly.  I was originally a fan of fusing rap and rock, and I still think these guys are pretty good, but they are really not that strong a group.  This cd has a lot of emphasis on style rather then substance, which bothered me a lot even when I first got it.  Now everyone has pretty much forgotton this cd; I think that maybe kids in the future will listen to it, but it might just be one of those cds that doesn't have staying power.  and the rapping, which I originally thought was cool, I soon tired of.  rap as a style doesn't hold up well, which is why rap stars have to release so many cds year after year to keep up popularity.  its not about love of music anymore, its about marketing.  Also, these guys lost some of their magic when everyone started buying their stuff.  Now they have to appeal to the lowest common denominator, instead of making cool music (which I know they have the ability to make).  Instead, they collaborate with Jay-Z; I mean, come on!
B00097DX3U|3.0|I was hoping for some more hard music.  Instead, Audioslave gives us a softer album.  There are no \\"hard\\" tracks such as Cochise.  It's a letdown, but not necessarily bad.
B000002MY3|5.0|This is great workout music for body and mind, since I first listened to \\"You Oughta Know\\" while doing lat pulldowns at the gym.  (PULL) \\"And would she have your baby\\" (PULL) \\"I bet she'd make a really excellent mother\\".<br /><br />Alanis is a workout for mind and body, the alternative when there was an alternative.  She's still the best, she's still the beat, she's not just a punked-out angry-candy chick.  It's why I love Tori Amos, Patty Griffin, Shawn Colvin, Ani DiFranco and Anny Celsi.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Dont listen to all those negative reviews these haters are throwing out there.  EMANCIPATION OF MIMI IS AMAZING!!.  Dont burn it, buy it.  I guarantee you will fall in love with it.  Mariah is taking it back.  Just when you thought she fell off.. BAM!.. she drops this album.  I love all of the songs, especially the ballads, \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"I wish you knew\\"...etc.  This is the type of album where you can related to every song.  She is saying what you are feeling. Honestly, this is one album that I never get tired of listening to over and over again.
B0006ZRX86|5.0|Alright! First off, to all of you elitist, indie drones, is anything truly original anymore? Get off your high horse! Yes, the Arcade Fire might sound reminiscent of early U2 or the Talking Heads, but they've moved on. U2 is the most dried up, failed attempt at a come back I've ever seen. And the Talking Heads died with the 80's, with dignity, and David Byrne sounds completely different. So how about giving these guys a chance.    The Arcade Fire is so amazing. I'd heard of them before, and the other day I was at the record store and I grabbed my friend Camy by the arm as my heart began to flutter...the sounds of some kind of epic, theatrical, chamber music plane crash were filling the air. I asked her who it was. \\"The Arcade Fire\\", she replied. Needless to say I bought Funeral instead of NMH on vinyl. And the CD has only left my stereo twice since I bought it, two weeks ago. I love this album and so will you. There, I said it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|this was the first cd I got back in 6th grade, and boy did I think it was funny.  I mean, the guy sings the \\"f-word\\" about 50+ times in one song, so whats not to like, right? well, other than the fact that I \\"grew up\\" and listened to better music later on, this isn't that bad.  well, unless you are older than a 6th grader.  then it sucks.  and boy, this album sucks.  basically everything wrong with music today can be traced to this album.  its that bad.  its funny as heck, but this is terrible music.  it is worth a novelty listen if you want to be cracked up a bit, but other then that its garbage.  and Fred Durst trying to do slower emotional songs at the end is just a complete joke.  avoid this cd and their others like the plague.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I rented this series on account of much of it's positive feedback here and was very taken by this little train of a series that could. I say little because it didn't receive much attention while on air, but in regards to concepts and picture and adventure this series is anything but \\"little\\" it's a gigantic masterpiece! I would have given it five stars but I found the ending somewhat confusing...but I guess I need not worry because...get this...THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH A MOVIE to continue the story. So if your looking for something that defines originality, then get this series and get it fast so you'll be all caught-up in time for the movie...or shall I say many movies (I think it's going to be a trilogy or something?). The characters will not disappoint, each one so dynamic and interesting, it's no wonder this show was too big for television...it definitely belongs on the big screen! <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when paying for the album. I knew they deserved my money (the last album is still one of my favorites), but would this album even come close to the pure rock that this hybrid-of-a-band produced on their self-titled first album? My question was answered in the first 4 songs. <br />I had heard Your Time Has Come on their MySpace.com page and was hoping the rest of the album would keep the same balls-to-the-walls attitude. My favorite song has to be Doesn't Remind Me or Out of Exile. Though Remind Me doesn't keep that hard-rock edge, the lyrics are creative and the guitar has a great sound that will keep you humming the rest of the day. Out of Exile, the title track from the album, hits you in the face with hard guitar riffs and pounding drums. <br />At times, Tom Morello gets a little too creative with the guitar (he still is one of my favorites of all time), and the sharp shreeks and bites of the strings are distracting. However, Chris Cornell more than makes up for this with that great rock voice that never disappoints. <br />You certainly won't feel inspired to take on the world after listening to the album, but you'll certainly want to buy tickets to a show. Enjoy.

0062502182|5.0|Although it's been praised as wise and deep and derided as trivial and shallow, The Alchemist is indubitably a book that has made an impact on people around the world. It is a book full of romantic allegories that may or make not make sense to the reader, but in spite of the \\"fluff\\" that appears nonsensical at times, the book does convey powerful messages. Interestingly enough, the basic principles of The Alchemist can be found in the prologue. The story of Santiago and his journey is full of symbolism that underscores the 4 principles outlined in the prologue. Personally speaking, I found the prologue to be the most important and practical part of the book. The story itself is just a romantic fantasy tale that will appeal to sentimental types. Coelho's strength is in the inspirational simplicity of his words--he urges the reader to pursue his or her own personal destiny to become \\"an instrument of God\\" and \\"save the Soul of the World.\\" Although I did not understand the meaning of all of the terms in The Alchemist, such as the \\"Language of the World\\", it is sufficient to know that you have acquired a few more tools in your bag as you embark on the journey towards your own Personal Destiny.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|(If you don't know why I signaled out this movie for the title of my review, watch this film and listen to one of the songs & you will see why).<br /><br />\\"Team America: World Police\\" is the brainchild of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of \\"South Park\\". Right from the first scene, Stone and Parker's touch is extremely evident: this film is offensive, vulgar and disgusting, but at the same time, it's so repulsively funny. Granted, I've never seen an episode of \\"South Park\\", but if it's anything like this movie, I think I'll enjoy it.<br /><br />\\"Team America: World Police\\" tells the story of a special police force that is bent on protecting America, even if it means destroying the Eifel Tower. (And did I mention all the characters are puppets?). When their M - like boss Spotswood learns of an attack put together bu various terrorist organizations,, he recruits Broadway star Gary Johnston to help the team by going the fictional Middle Eastern city Durka Durkastan and infiltrating the terrorists and saving the world,. The plan works flawlessly (and hilariously), or so it seems. Gary and his teammate Lisa fall deeply in love with each other, culmianting int he much publicized sex scene (which is longer thanks to the unrated version). They soon learn that the attack is far from over, and has been planned by North Korean dictator Kimg Jong Ill (who is hilariously). There are some very funny moments included in this film, including:<br /><br />-A two minute vomiting sequence that  is truly gross but extremely hilarious.<br /><br />-A retarted Matt Damon (one of the many liberal celebrities that are lampooned in this movie.<br /><br />-The sex scene (like you didn't see that coming).<br /><br />-The scene where Gary needs to prove his trust to Spotswood.<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest aspect of the movie, however, are the songs. These includce the theme song, \\"Only A Woman\\", \\"Freedom Isn't Free\\", \\"The Pearl Harbor Sucks Song\\", \\"You Are Worhtress Arec Barrwin\\", Ill's \\"I'm So Ronery\\", \\"Montage\\" and the uproraious \\"Rent\\" sendup (however, I find it a little disturbing that, for the dvd release, they left in the line \\"the pope has got it and so do you\\" in the wake of the tragic passing of the pope).<br /><br />My advice is plain and simple: if you enjoy lauhing, you will enjoy \\"Team America: World Police\\".m So Ronery\\", \\"Montage\\" and the uproraious \\"Rent\\" sendup (however, I find it a little disturbing that, for the dvd release, they left in the line \\"the pope has got it and so do you\\" in the wake of the tragic passing of the pope). <br /> <br />My advice is plain and simple: if you enjoy lauhing, you will enjoy \\"Team America: World Police\\".
B00080ZG10|5.0|I'd like to see if any of the people writing negative reviews about this movie could have pulled off what Martin Scorsese did in his vision of the story of Howard Hughes.  It is possible that Dicaprio could have sparked some ideas for making the movie.... but no way could it have been any more influended by him as Deniro did for Raging Bull.  No matter who started the idea for it... Marty definitely fuels the engines of his movies.  There is so much to comprehend about this mans life... it probably could have been turned into a week long tv series... which made me respect it even more.  So even with the last second splash of popluarity that Million Dollar Baby \\"earned\\" to nab the oscar.  I think we all know who deserved that oscar for direction.  (No offense Clint)

015626224X|3.0|In Down & Out in Paris & London the perspective and tone that Orwell writes from is different than in his more prominent works 1984 and Animal Farm. Down & Out is much more candid and has a feel more like some of Orwell's famous essays.    Down & Out is in great part autobiographical and was written by Orwell as a profound political statement about the lack of effective governmental programs and the social cracks that unemployed workers fall through in Europe's major cities. Unfortunately, a large part of this political statement has been lost over the past 72 years. As a result Down & Out's major contemporary importance is historical, specifically to Orwell's development as a socially aware writter. However, Orwell still makes several points that remain interesting. First, society chooses to remain ignorant of the plight of its unfortunate members and when it does act it is largely ineffective because its compassion and charity is clouded by its own ignorance. Second, Orwell seeks to justify schemes and con-work by impoverished citizens not just because of neccesity, but because businessmen are inherently conniving at that some are only vindicated because they are successfully rich. Orwell writes, \\"Money has become the true test of virtue...A beggar, looked at realistically, is simply a business man, getting his living, like other business men, in the way that comes to hand.\\" Third, Orwell reaches an interesting paradox where he places much of the responsibility of the unemployed, transient worker on the social context that prevents him from re-establishing himself into society's graces, but indicates that some individuals can maintain their self-worth and identity as a functional member of society with his characterization of a hobo street painter Bozo.     Orwell's adept social commentary is present in Down & Out, but the expository purpose of the novel has been lost with time. It is interesting and thoughtful to read, but I recommend it only to readers who are interested in the autobiographical importance of the novel or those who are interested in the conditions of poverty during the 1930s.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back and better than ever. I have continuously played this album from the moment I bought it. I'm not sick of it yet. Usually, one or two weeks after purchasing a CD I get tired of it, but not \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" I believe this CD has the potential for longevity. I agree with those that say if you liked \\"Butterfly,\\" then you should like this one also. I would definitely put this album in her Top 5, for me Top 3. I really hope she makes another CD after this one. I'll be looking forward to it. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />It's like That <br />We Belong Together <br />Mine Again <br />Stay The Night <br />I Wish You Knew <br />Joy Ride <br />Fly Like A Bird <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|Very few musicians have explored so many genres of music as Chris Cornell.  He first established himself as one of the industries most powerful and versatile voices in Rock, Metal, and Grunge with Soundgarden.  His solo album 'Euphoria Morning' wonderfully explored R&B, Folk, and a medley of music found by no other Seattle musician.  His work in Audioslave dominated Rock charts once again and led the group to a multi-platinum selling album.  But after 20 years, Chris has finally achieved something he never has before: salvation. <br /> <br />Audioslave's 'Out of Exile' contains a bold new direction for Chris, but will his fans accept it?  Yes.  Many fans of Chris found redemption in their own depressions because someone else shared the same feelings.  These same fans would not care for other more upbeat artists because they couldn't identify with them.  Chris' lyrics here not only identify with his same fan base, but give them hope, something that has not been seen by any of the other Seattle singers yet.  Two have died needlessly, never achieving peace, and only confirming to their fans that the Generation X depressions are real and not a phase.  This 'Fight Club' style of thinking has never been challenged so thoroughly by anyone else until now.  Chris' new lyrics provide salvation not only for him, but reestablish hope in his fans, and listeners.  This is his best work to date. <br /> <br />Tom Morello has already established himself as an incredible musician who can experiment on the guitar like no other.  Not since the likes of Hendrix has a guitarist made such bold and experimental playing style.  Tom continues his legacy here with new sounds, riffs and methods that even he has never played before.   <br /> <br />Audioslave is not Audioslave anymore.  They've come together as a band and are no longer Soundgarden + Rage Against The Machine for a new sound and direction that puts this album as their best work to date.  There are no songs to listen for, because the album contains no filler.  Each and every song could hold its own as a radio single.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone, not just previous fans.   <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|This album is first class material. Britney is the most popular singer of current times and the best.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin city may have to be the best movie I have seen this year. In short the movie levels onto standars such as Spiderman2 and superman. Though Sin city does tend to exeel these movies by one point. The acting. Mikey Rouke steals the show as Marv, the hulkish  thug whose main purpose is to find the killers of the love of his life, and give them some street justice. His story is compelling and very, very, violent. Well I take that back the most violent story would have to be Bruce Willis who plays Hartigan , a violent ex cop who wants to protect a stripper from his past misadventure that has her also involved, in this story line you actually see a mans testicles ripped off............actually that was...........god .........burr. Anyway overall all the stories are downright violent. There is one more but I would not want to intrude like I did before.. <br />Now as for dvd news Rodrigues is giving out a threatical release and an extended release. <br />Also he will bring in more Sin city movies from now on, and will be planning to release a new one 2008 or 9, so get ready. <br />Yours trully  <br />film critique of the week.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I got a pre-release copy of this cd and listened to it during work.   In its entirety, this cd has a very nice flow of rhythm to it.  Reminded me a little of The Avalanches mixes.   It has a different feel from their debut album, but the intricate mixing of tunes and rap and even just spoken words shows how gifted the artists are and how well they work together.  Late last week I have had a different song every day ringing in my head, going from Last Living Soul, to El Manana, to Dirty Harry, to All Alone.  This album definitely gets to you after several listening sessions.  Dennis Hopper's narration is creepy in the Monkey MOuntain song.
B00097DX3U|1.0|Be Yourself is a decent song but isn't all that interesting and there's another song which i can't recall the title of that i've heard a few times and the riff is the same riff as Get on the Snake from Soundgaren off Louder than Love. So much you can sing the melody of it to the Audioslave song. Soundgarden was, in my opinion, the best rock band out there. I miss them dearly. Morello is so damn annoying with both his mouth and his guitar. flap both your left wings and fly to Russia, commie. His playing is unique i'll give him that but its also very repetitive and colorless. Whatever. I won't be buying the record so this review is more of a rant than anything. Just felt like posting it. Thanks.    Update:    Yay! They broke up!! Thank you!!!
6301978587|5.0|Yentl is expertly crafted.  Barbra Streisand's production was perfect in every way - from the soundtrack to the casting to the setting - it could not have been improved in any way.  There is every reason to have this amazingly delicate and sensitive woman's film as part of your collection.  A must see for feminists of both genders.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Well, one won't have to wait any longer for Chris Cornell's wailing, and Tom Morello's great guitar styling's any longer (plus everyone else's great contribution, because it is terrific).  Thankfully too, Audioslave proves they can keep on charging.  This is especially true with such songs as \\"Be Yourself\\", but they are not limited there. <br /> <br />In fact, since all of the members have such great experience (as we know: Soundgarden for Cornell, and the others Rage Against the Machine), they use it once again to their complete advantage, as they simultaneously tighten up just the overall adhesiveness of the band in general. <br /> <br />I still haven't decided whether I like this one better then the other, although thanks to MySpace I've given it plenty of listening, but either way one can appreciate the album when thought of separately from the first.  I mean this is no sophomore slump, but of course this might not be a miraculous step-up from their last album either.
B0007TKNIS|3.0|A few years ago, as a valentine's day present, my step-father took my mother to see Phantom of the Opera at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis.  My mom came back with a soundtrack, and I immediately fell in love with it.  The music was incredible, and I knew that I had to see this musical.  Fast-Forward a year or two, and I got the extended two disc soundtrack with extra songs.  Last year, I finally saw Phantom at the Majestic Theatre in New York.  You can imagine my excitement when I heard that a movie version of the musical was coming to theatres.  You can also imagine my dissappointment when I noticed that it was getting less than stellar reviews from my local paper.  Finally, I managed to see the movie myself, and here is the bare truth. <br /> <br />First off, before the actual review, a short summary.  It is the late 1800's and the two new managers of the Opera Populaire, Andre and Firmin, are in trouble.  Their leading lady, Carlotta Giudicelli, has quit due to accidents caused by the \\"Opera Ghost\\" .  Luckily, chorus girl Christine Daae has been taking lessons from a mysterious tutor,(who unbeknownst to her is the Opera Ghost, and is in love with her) and can easily take Carlotta's place.  At that night's perfomance of the opera, Hannibal, she is recognized by Raoul, the Viscount de Chagny, who was her childhood sweetheart.  Their love is rekindled, which really ticks the Phantom off.   <br /> <br />Now, for the good.  Most of the actors are fairly good.  Emmy Rossum shines as Christine Daae with a look and voice that almost rivals the immortal Sarah Brightman.  Emmy's voice is crystal clear, and has a tone that could melt the hardest of hearts.  The actors playing Andre and Firmin are very good, and very funny.  The actress playing Madame Giry, the ballet mistress and the person who knows the secrets of the phantom, is exceptionally good, and the girl playing her daughter, Meg, is absolutely adorable.  Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul, sings well but seems to havethree emotions he switches between.  Emotional, happy, and nervous.  This gets slightly boring after a while, but thankfully, his singing talent balances this out.  Stealing the spotlight is Minnie Driver as Carlotta.  She is simply hilarious, whether she is shooting off drivel in her accent, or doing a very good job lyp-synching.  Miss Driver even sings the song from the closing credits, \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\".  The sets are incredible, and the music is fairly faithful to the musical. <br /> <br />Now, for the bad.  First of all, several points in the plot have been changed from the musical.  The chandelier no longer falls after \\"All I Ask of You (reprise)\\", it falls after \\"Past the Point of No Return\\".  An entire musical section, in which Andre and Firmin and the others recieve notes regarding the production of DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT, has been cut, and the parts of music from here have either been shoved into different parts of the movie or completely cut out.  The entertaining scene in which the cast is trying to learn the music for DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT has been completely cut out.  The good part of this in regards to people that have not seen the musical at all is that, \\"No one will know if it is right...no one will care\\".  Some new things have been added.  Some of these are good, but some of these are bad.  A swordfight has been added in the graveyard scene, and I'm sure this was done because the mass public just loves a movie that contains a carefully choreographed swordfight, and it gave the editors something exciting to put in the trailers.  From a dramatic standpoint it is pointless for two reasons.  A.)  the Phantom very nearly loses, and this deflates his image as the menacing villain.   <br />B.)  the original scene involved the Phantom shooting fireballs from a skull mounted on a pike.  Considering today's movie magic, this would have been easier to do than choreographing an entire swordfight, which is incredibly complicated. <br />Finally, the one thing thatdrags this down from the incredible spectacle that it could've been is actually the star of the movie, Gerard Butler.  From a pop-culture standpoint he is perfect for the role.  He is good looking, in a way that lonely housewives and widowers absolutely love.  He also has some strange underlying sensuality about him.  As a singer, he leaves much to be desired.  Not that he is bad, in fact he sings fairly well in \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Music of the Night\\" and \\"Past the Point of No Return\\".  This is, however, an opera, and much of the dialogue is sung.  It is in this sung dialogue that Mr. Butler falls short.  If he is not yelling the lines more than singing them, he is singing them in a very throaty, gravelly, grunting voice that frankly wears on the nerves.  True, he does convey his emotions well, but it would be nice if he could actually attempt to sing while he's emoting.  This is a musical for God's sake. <br /> <br />There are a few more bright spots in this movie.  The prologue is done in black and white, which makes that transformation of the opera house even more amazing, and there are brief epilogue scenes every once in a while.  The addition of an instrumental version of \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" in a couple a spots (most notably the new ending for the movie, which is an absolute tearjerker.) adds to the emotion of the movie.  Overall, this movie could've been so much better had they at least got someone with a better voice to sing the part of Phantom.  For heaven's sakes, a bunch of very good singers have sung the part, they could've done it.  Then the changes to the plot would've been bearable.  In fact, as is they are bearable.  I just don't like the way that Gerard Butler sings certain parts of this movie, and it is this fact that earns what could've been a spectacular movie an average rating.
B000003RCY|5.0|For a first album, this CD is very solid. We open up with Wollt Ihr Das Bett in Flammen Sehen? which serves to introduce the theme of the album, heartbreak, as well as the band itself, with the croud roaring at the end and the chant of \\"Rammstein!\\" The music itself is solid, with samples from the original Doom videogame mixed into 2 good, yet repetitive, riffs. We follow with the frantic riff of \\"Der Meister\\" which is about destruction, has 2 frantic riffs, and an awesome chorus in which the key suddenly switches to major. Following this is a song about longing and sex, Weisses Fleisch, which features a good guitar solo, and even more frantic riff, and use of electronic vocal effects, which follows with the similar \\"Asche zu Asche\\" which seems to be about some evil form of Jesus (Ich komm Wieder in zehn tagen) (I will return in 10 years) and has a great, yet repetitive riff. <br />The album finally calms down a bit with the slow, mournful \\"Seemann,\\" which is simply beautiful. The electronic chirping in the background adds another element of beauty to it, and the lyrics are mournful- (Am ende bleib ich doch alleine) (In the end I am left alone). Of course, this is all to be kicked up again with the obsessive, pounding, and simply awesome \\"Du Riechst So Gut,\\" a song about a stalker, and obsession. The riff is great, and Till's vocals really shine in this song. Plus this song is very driving. This is followed by the slower \\"Das Alte Leid,\\" about the end of the old sorrow, which is an awesome song, or rather would be if it weren't so dragged out. Shave off a minute or so and this would be a great song. As it is though, it's pretty weak. Of course we are saved from this by the story of a man who lost his lover, \\"Heirate Mich,\\" which explores necrophilia, and has a great riff with great vocals. Of course, this has to be followed, and is, by a song about preventing heartbreak, called \\"Herzeleid,\\" which is a bit repetitive, but awesome, and says that if you don't want heartbreak, don't get involved with anyone. The lyrics are short and recited very slowly. Following this is the odd \\"Laichzeit,\\" with interesting keyboards, but nothing remarkable. They go out with another announcement, reminding you who the album isdone by, and remembering a tragedy, in their self-titled track \\"Rammstein,\\" which is chilling, frantic, and slow, all at once. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album, the highlights being \\"Der Meister\\" and \\"Du Riechst so Gut.\\" <br /> <br />Oh and the person who gave the one-star review, listen to the album first then review it. Who knows? you might like it if you get past your bias against these guys.
B000059XYK|4.0|This movie is not supposed to an oscar winning performance, it is an entertaining movie to watch and there is nothing else like it (except for the original), so I think it has some redeeming qualities just for that alone.  I thought I would hate it, but I was pleasantly entertained.  The only thing that got old for me was the car chase.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded. There is nothing more to say.
B00065MDRW|5.0|Within the pantheon of that which is Progressive Rock, the King Crimson debut, IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING is one of the major classics that truly stands out.  Bands like ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and Rush used elements found in this album in developing their own sound.  The music on here is so well-written, that the overall sound takes you on a mental journey to another reality. <br /> <br />I always believed the Yes song, 'Heart of the Sunrise' was a rip-off of '21st Century Schizoid Man'.  The fast guitar parts are almost identical.  Pete Sinfield's eccentric lyrics don't make too much sense, and he was probably on a lot of acid at the time, but they still work in this music.  This song is rather long, but changes it up the entire time...few notes are repeated in the instrumental break, which is a juggernaut of time changes, and guitar riffs that will keep you practicing for hours!  This was also one of 'heavier' songs around in 1969, and we can look upon it as an early metal song.  These guys, especially Robert Fripp were light years ahead of themselves when this came out. <br /> <br />'I Talk to the Wind' has some beautiful flute playing from Ian McDonald, similar in some ways to Eric Dolphy.  It is a peaceful, serenating piece that I find to be extremely relaxing.  On the flip side, we have 'Epitaph,' which is still a pretty soft song, but it is also intense and dark.  Greg Lake's emotional vocals dictate a world of loneliness and despair.  The use of the mellotron is a refreshing element that makes this band truly stand apart, and adds to the intensity of the recording. <br /> <br />'Moonchild' is another soothing piece.  It gives the listener visions of floating about in the clouds for about the first two minutes, and then for around nine minutes, it's a total noise jam with a ton of empty space.  This is probably the genesis of later work during the John Wetton era.  They had the right idea, except it lacks the direction.  Most people I know skip over thisentire section, and unless this type of improvisation makes you ga-ga, I recommend you skip over it as well.  There isn't much to miss out on. <br /> <br />The epic masterpiece of this album is the title track, 'In The Court of the Crimson King.'  I consider it to be Greg Lake's career high point, (I love ELP too, but there wouldn't have been an ELP if it wasn't for Robert Fripp.)  A major subtlty that I love about this song is the percussion work from Mike Giles.  Much of the contribution is little, yet still important.  Some of the backbeat drum fills behind the mellotron gives this music a certain aliveness.  It's tough to describe, but when I listen, it brings life to the music and when you hear it, it's like a familiar friend you meet upon listening.  I also love the pseudo-ending with a pause, followed by a fill from Mike Giles and the mellotron and background vocals come back in and the song goes on for another two minutes.   <br /> <br />Listen to this music...it will truly stand the test of time and is essential to the collection of any progressive rock fan.  It is not the best King Crimson material by far, though.  This band has had several different sounds throughout their 35 year career, this being the most watered down.  I'd still pick it up, but albums like THRAK, LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC, and DISCIPLINE are miles ahead.  Also, Robert Fripp taught Greg Lake how to play bass, so all you ELP fans must respect Robert Fripp for doing so, and thank him by buying his music.
B000002WYW|4.0|It was tough period for Hip Hop, especially when there was war between the East and West Coast and also the death of 2Pac and Biggie Smalls, also it was the time of Puff and his Bad Boy Family where they had Hip Hop at the palm of their hand. But Wu being the Wu they weren't concerned with it, they carried on and brought out double-CD which would have been a perfect album with one CD, but it's still a decent album. With gems like Triumph and many many more, you can still see that they haven't changed much except they are more sharper on the lyricals and the production work has improved. The album also features True Master and the 4th Disciple for production work.
0375751513|4.0|First let me say that this is a very good story.  I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days.  I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.<br /><br />Second, this is a deep story.  The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry.  I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil.  It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry.  Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place.  One must read and then read again chapter two of this book.  This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy.  It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.<br /><br />After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel.  However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read.  At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old.  Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years.  It seems as if it was added later to give this history.  It did add a little to the story but not too much.<br /><br />I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.<br /><br />Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book.  Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read.  You will not be disappointed that you read this book.
B0000039PW|5.0|At the time where the West Coast was dominating the Hip Hop charts, Biggie aka The Notorious B.I.G brought the attention and the hip hop scene back to the East Coast with one LP \\"Ready To Die\\". Album's gritty and grimey production work with Biggie spitting without any guest appearence, with the exception of \\"Method Man\\" but that's as far as it gets. With him only spitting bars and smashing the world with his storytelling, freestyling and humorous observations, this albums shows Biggie's talents dipslayed, with cut's like \\"Gimmie The Loot\\" where he play two people and with \\"Juicy\\" where he talks about how hard life was and now he's living the good life. The saga would later on continue...
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God is like a shot of tequila... sometimes it goes down perfectly, other times it's like someone just kicked you in the throat.  Either way it's exactly what you wanted when you took the shot.  Lamb of God is in my opinion the most aggresive outfit in modern metal. Their style reminds me of Pantera (Southern Trendkill era) with elements of thrash thrown in for good measure.  At times it's more than your ears can handle, but mostly it's good heavy metal fun. About the only critism I can think of is their political views... I am a Sgt in the USAF and I despise the anti-war message of today's metal.  Aside from that I rock out to Lamb of God everyday... check out their older albums, especially New American Gospel. Metal rules, check out BLS, Shadows Fall, and Mastadon!!!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|People dislike this movie because they don't get it.  \\"Constantine\\" is not a horror film.  To the contrary: part of what makes the movie captivating is the main character's jaded, unimpressed, business-as-usual approach to battling demons.  We also get a frisky Gabriel and a droll Satan.  I loved the originality. The movie is a character study, an exploration of good and evil, a tale of redemption, and a bunch of fun. I don't believe in Catholicism or Hell, but I appreciated the fact that the movie had a point-of-view on these issues, and I enjoyed watching the characters struggle within its framework. Keanu is well-cast and delivers a spot-on performance as a cynical, reluctant hero.  His restraint is a necessary balance to the extravagance of some of the other characters, notably the fabulous Tilda Swinton. Keanu-bashing is a tired old sport for lemming-minded critics.  I enjoyed Keanu's performance in this movie as much as I liked him in \\"Hardball.\\"  Redemption movies don't work unless the actor is credible when he behaves badly, and credible when he reaches for something better within himself.  Not every actor can do this.  Keanu can.  I liked this movie because of his performance, not in spite of it.  I welcome a sequel.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|System of a Down are unique... yes.  They have some heavy riffs... yes.  Is it worth my time to listen to 40 minutes of political BS?... After a couple of listens to this new album I am thinking NO!!!   How many times do I have to listen to rambling crap about genocice??  Plus Daron Malakian needs to learn that he is a good guitar player, but a horrible singer. Come on, he sounds like a cat with his balls caught in a trap! I would shelf this album and buy a real metal CD like BLS, Lamb of God, or Shadows Fall.
B000002UA5|5.0|This is sadly Pink Floyd's most underrated albums, which I think in many ways, is their best. Of course it's a transition record, but it's too bad they never got this exprimental on later albums. You reviewers that write this off as trash can take your place back on the farm with the other sheep. Your brain doesn't have the capacity for this kind of genius. If you still don't get it, then try a bit of \\"psychedelic\\" tea to help convince you...
0634060384|5.0|For years, this underground fake book was THE book you had to have to survive on any professional straight Jazz bandstand... and it was tough to find, not to mention expensive.  So underground you had to whisper for it at the counter of only the hippest music shops in town and if no one was looking for thirty bucks or so they'd get you a copy... (I'm not joking !) Then it began floating around the net, and for some reason each time the sites would get shut down... and now finally, a \\"legit\\" copy is available.  Though perhaps we'll never know the full story of just who exactly wrote it and where he/she/they lived... the fact is that the book (atleast for the time being) is now available... ironically by HAL LEONARD, the publishing company that tended to publish all those other FAKE BOOKS for years that made the REAL BOOK so appreciated (LEONARD's books tend to have great tune selections, but some of the worst changes in the world... in contrast, the REAL BOOK's sheets, though not perfect are usually a safe call when you're called up to blow, also unlike Scher's commercially available THE NEW REAL BOOK they're a lot more practical (i.e. you take one glimpse at the sheet and the form is staring right back at'cha !) - - One more funny ironic point, even if the anonymous author/authors were involved in this project its funny because I guess they'll now be pursuing people who BOOTLEG their books... outlaws joining the system... that's progress for ya !<br /><br />All in all, books 1 and 2 are essential purchases (I pray 3 will become available too.)  I actually tend to play more tunes from Book 2 which includes JEANINE, INDIANA, BYE BYE BLACKBIRD, NEARNESS OF YOU, however REAL BOOK I set the standard of what tunes we should play at our sessions.  If there's any fault its the overdependence of musicians on it, to the point that many musicians simply don't learn equally important tunes found outside it (even though it does not include EVERY essential standard, it definitely gives you more than enough to survive...) but the fact is, its must have material... if you don't have it, go out and get it... unless you have a perfect ear and most the tunes already learned and memorized, you can't really call yourself a pro without it and will find yourselves embaressed at most sessions everytime a tune (9 times out of 10 at some sessions) is called from this book !you more than enough to survive...) but the fact is, its must have material... if you don't have it, go out and get it... unless you have a perfect ear and most the tunes already learned and memorized, you can't really call yourself a pro without it and will find yourselves embaressed at most sessions everytime a tune (9 times out of 10 at some sessions) is called from this book !
B000254EXC|5.0|This CD showcases the talent of a very passionate singer who used the highs and lows and all the in-betweens in his voice to communicate a love for singing.  He is a true talent that uses his gift to express the emotions the listener is seeking. He gives you what you want before you even know you want it.  A well crafted CD with a wonderful mix of songs and messages.  Highly recommended.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Why? That is my question. Why did they have to take a perfectly good horror film and tack on an arbitrary twist at the end that negates everything that went before it. Why? Saw had so much promise all throughout, and, if done right, the ending could have tied it all together and really delivered a message, but instead, the ending essentially throws everything out the window in favor of tricking the audience. Sure, all of the self-contained plot elements might make sense, but the resolution completely ignores all logical character motivations. This is not to say that Saw isn't a disturbingly scary movie for most of its length, but, jeez, why? <br /> <br />The film opens in a disgusting bathroom that you can almost smell through the screen, where Adam (Leigh Whannell, who also wrote the screenplay) and Lawrence (Cary Elwes) wake up to find themselves chained at the foot on opposite sides of the room, and, oh, there's a dead man lying in between them. They quickly intuit that this is not good, and Lawrence, a doctor, conveniently has a good idea of who has captured them here, because he was once a suspect. It seems there is a serial killer on the loose, but this killer does not technically do any killing himself; he cleverly finds ways to allow his prey to kill themselves. <br /> <br />And so the killer has given Lawrence an ultimatum: kill Adam before six o'clock, or the doctor's wife and young daughter will be killed. The killer has left certain objects in strategic places for the two of them to discover and use as they will, including a jigsaw for each of them--not to cut off their chains, mind you, but rather their feet. Obviously both of them are freaked out. Along the way, we get some flashbacks involving Detectives Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung) in pursuit of the killer. And there we have the setup: will Lawrence and Adam find a way to escape to save the lives of loved ones, or will Lawrence give in and kill Adam first? After all, he's got all the tools he needs at his disposal. But, wait, why are they there in the first place? And who is this killer who has brought them here? <br /> <br />A film like Saw is more frustrating than your average run-of-the-mill bad horror movie, which is not to say that this is a bad horror movie; in fact, it's quite good. A bad horror movie is preposterous from the first frame to the last, and believe me, there are more of these kinds of movies than the world needs. However, Saw gives us an entirely credible premise, and fills it with just enough elements to keep our heads from spinning off, but then takes a horrible wrong turn and the wheels come flying off, leaving some viewers to think it's a brilliant twist that brings everything together when really it's a cop out, and offers nothing deeper than a \\"gotcha!\\" moment. <br /> <br />Director James Wan has infused the film with a lot of style, using washed-out colors and quick edits to give it a gritty look and keep the suspense factor high. He also succeeds in using psychological suspense rather than monsters and one-off spooks. There are some truly terrifying moments where you know something bad is going to go down, but you don't know the what, when or who. All of the good points had me thinking that Saw would find a way to rise above the mediocre formulas of horror films, but the ending--oh, the ending!--still has me asking why, and not in a good way. <br /> <br />Note: All of this talk and I haven't even mentioned the blood, gore guts, and violence that is depicted in this film. It is ample, I will tell you that. Saw is not suitable for children, and there are plenty of adults who will want to avert their eyes at some points as well.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Smart people outsmart each other, then themselves. Oh those were the good old days. This cd is horrific, i feel like i want to cry. Their debut was spectacular, toxicity was subpar(why every one prefers it over their self titled is beyond me)and steal this album was brilliant in some places. What has happened!!! The lyrics are totaly trite. The same line repeated over and over again. I saw byob on the tele and got all worked up, well ive never been so let down in my life. Daron sounds like a whiny prepubecent teenager. I cant stand hes voice. Hes also to blame for the decline in lyrics. Normaly serj's department. I just hope hypnotise is all serj to make up for this mess. Please!!!
B00097DX3U|5.0|I have been waiting for this album forever picking it up today and man they rock and the guitar work on this album is solid no guitarist in rock can touch Tom Morello right now.. Don't have a favorite song because I view this album as a master piece through beginning till end ... Thank you Chris Cornell and the Tom Morello and the rest of the band for making music rock again and on a mature level!!!!
B000002LCK|5.0|Esta recopilacin es un clasico que muestra uno de los grupos mas influyentes de la decada de los 80 en su apogeo con temas que nunca muren veinte aos despues.Con influencias desde Joy division y david bowie en los 70 han sabido marcar una pauta para el nacimiento del denominado new wave de los 80 y la musica de baile con mucho caracter.Imprescindible
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is the best cd I heard in a long time, no words can really express on how truely great this cd really is.  I admediately fell in love with this cd when i frist heard it which was about a week ago.    Out of Exile is my favorite track on this disc followed by Doesn't Remind Me.  Any song can be picked as a single on this cd they are all that good, and there are different ranges of music on this cd as well, not just hard arena rock.  I think Chris Cornelle is one of best singers/songwriters of our time and he fits well with Rage, however I do miss Zach and hope he releases a solo or any kind of cd in the near future.  Also pick up Seethers sophomore cd it isn't as good as this but it is worth a listen if your into hard rock like Audioslave.  Please buy this disc, its well worth the $10.
B00004YRQA|5.0|A must have for anyone who owns a PS2, with this you can save your game files so you can continue playing. They are compact and strong. Highly recommended.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album more straight up rock and less depressing rock, Ive already listened to it 7 times and each time its sounding better and better. Give it a chance man, no band ever sounds the same after a debut, example look at Pearl Jam after TEN the rest of the albums were much different.
0792164903|5.0|This is a great movie and must see, it is horror at it's finest and also has one of America's hottest actors - Johnny Depp!<br /><br />It is Tim Burton's finest work too and plays on the old original tale of \\"The Headless Horsemen\\" though there are better changes to make this movie more fun and interesting. It has a gorgeous gothic atmosphere and beautiful to watch and marvel at.<br /><br />If you don't like these things, just watch for Johnny Depp. He's hot. So hot. :P
B0007GAERG|1.0|It's amazing...15 years in the business and she still sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard. She's trying to be all hip and cool, but instead, sounds like some girl who had a nervous breakdown..oops, um, she did. Mariah: you're washed up. Go away!
B00082IJ08|4.0|This album really didnt sound much like they're debut album, it sounds more mature. The gorillaz got rid of dan the automator for this cd, replacing him with Danger Mouse (never heard of him before the cd, but had heard of the beatles - JayZ Mix).  This album is good none the less, but dont expect another 19-2000 or slow country sounding track on this cd.  Most of the tracks are very chill and several seem to really stick out like Feel Good Inc., All Alone, and November Has Come. <br /> <br />Last Living Souls - One of my favorite tracks on the cd, starts off kinda funky, and sets the mood for the rest of the album.  It has a solid bass line, an 2-D's singing, almost talking, seems to really work <br /> <br />Kids With Guns - A pretty descent track.  Very simple song, with a slow bass line and 2-D saying kids with guns alot, and some women saying push it real good.  After a few easy does its, 2-D starts singing, which is where i think this track shines.  I like  Damons voice, without the effects he uses in other tracks on the cd. <br /> <br />Oh, Green World - A good track, not my favorite.  Starts with a lot of beeps and bloops.  After around a minute into it the song goes to Damon singing with a bit of a distorted voice.  Descent song, but it didnt really stick out much to me. <br /> <br />Dirty Harry - Ive been listening to this song for a while now.  It involves a childrens chorus, which I dont really like that much, but still kinda funky.  After a while,  the rapping starts.  I didnt really like his rap so much.  \\"im just a pawn, so he can advance, i remember when i would dance, all i wanna do is dance\\"?  Im not really sure what to say about this song, its not like the others on the album.  It seems a bit more like the older gorillaz stuff. <br /> <br />Feel Good Inc. - The latest single from them, and the best song on the cd.  This track is what got me pumped up for the cd's release.  Has a nice catchy bass line with some great vocals from  2D.  The rap part'sof the tracks are great.  This song is right up there with Clint Eastwood in my opinion as the best songs the Gorillaz have done. <br /> <br />El Manana - A slow song, that isnt one of the better tracks on the cd.  I dont really like this one, it doesnt sound like something from the gorillaz.  It is slow and Damon doesnt sound as good.  Its slow and kind of sad, doesnt sound like the gorillaz at all to me. <br /> <br />Every Plant We Reach Is Dead - Another slow song, but better than the one before it.  I love 2D's vocals on this track.  I dont really like the little breaks in between the verse's with the keyboard, but it doesnt take away from the song much.   <br /> <br />November Has Come -  One of the best songs on the CD, the song has a lot of rap, and the rap is broken up with a distored 2D singing.  I really liked his singing in this song, slow and chill.  I usually dont like rap much, but it sounds really good in this track. <br /> <br />All Alone - Second only to the great Feel Good inc. as the best track on the cd.  Starts off weird like most of the tracks on this cd, but unlike most of the others has a fast tempo.  I really love this bass in this song.  Its a great song to turn the subwoofer up all the way on.    Like the one before is heavy on rap.  All the background music is very good and it all fits together so well. <br /> <br />White Light - In my opinion, worst track on the CD.  The vocals 2D provides are very repetive.  He just says white light over and over.  What really brings it down is that he makes the bass sound effects with his mouth, kinda a dun dun dun sound.  The annoying bass and guitar, eh, i just dont like it. <br /> <br />Dare - Another of the dance songs on the cd.  Sounds a lot better than Dirty Harry.  All the sounds work well on this cd and the vocals are good too.  Makes me want to shake my bootay. <br /> <br />Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head - Very odd track.  I hated it first time through, but listened to it several times and now i think its one of the best tracks on the CD.  Dennis Hooper tells a story of a monkey type of civilization, With 2D on an accoustic guitar singing inbetween the spoken verses.  I dont quite get the story tho.  <br /> <br />Don't Get Lost in Heaven - Sounds like an older beach boys song.  I like 2D's vocals.  I am not one to like chorus's much, but it really fits this song well.  One of my favorite tracks and is a bit of a love song.  After reading the lyrics, it seems to be about a girlfriend who cheated on him, but I am not sure about this. <br /> <br />Demon Days - This track was not one of my favorites, but really fit well.  Very slow.  Sounds almost a little regee-ish.  Makes me happy and kinda picks up your spirits a little bit after a slow album.  really a good track to end the cd on. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good cd,  and in my opinion, one of the best one to come out so far this year.  This album was diffrent from what i expected.  If i had to choose one I would say that the self-titled album was better.  This one was just to slow and a little depressing at some times. Good on a slow rainy day when your just hanging out.  If you are a gorillaz fan, then buy this cd.  In fact, Why havent you already???  If you are new to the gorillaz, I would check this out as well as their debut cd, considering they are very diffrent.  I think the gorillaz should hook back up with dan if they release another album.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Gosh, it seems like fans of every female singer are so jealous of Madonna's success that they have to come write reviews every day from the same ip address and disguise themselves as different people. Anyhow, on to the record: it's a masterpiece. Who cares if it didn't sell well in America. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is an incredibly melodic, beautiful song.
B000001FGG|3.0|Yes, I know everyone's going to hate me for saying this, and I'm a huge fan of both Tom Dowd (the producer) and Cream, but this album stands as a monument to just how bad even a big budget live recording could be in this era.  I had the album, I bought the CD, I bought the re-mastered CD -- and they're all terrible.  I just shake my head every time I listen to the more or less contemporaneous Ten Years After Live at the Fillmore released a couple of years ago (produced by Eddie Kramer) -- that one sounds great, just like a live show at the Fillmore actually sounded.  This one sounds horrible.  Needles in the ear drums.     So we have the live show of a bunch of enjoyable journeymen recorded with great fidelity, and this musical work of genius is almost unlistenable -- there were better live recordings made in the 30s.  Life is a funny old duck.
067101756X|3.0|Bits and pieces of fascinating, tantalizing testimony scattered here and there in a long, often repetitive, discourse.  The first and last chapters have some literacy to them.  No doubt they were contributed by William J. Birnes, who gets a \\"with\\" credit on the title page.  The wide ranging middle is of a distinctly different style: rambling, self-centered, and cavalier.    Col. Corso is frustratingly coy with his facts.  On page 179 of the hardcover edition, for example, in the middle of a chronology of the development of the laser, he drops in the following zinger.  \\"[The laser] would also prove to be a weapon that would help us deploy a realistic threat to the [aliens] who seemed poised to trigger a nuclear war between the superpowers.\\"  The aliens wanted us to fight each other???  Wow!  What was the evidence?  Why wait until page 179 to tell us about it?  Why present it as an aside in the middle of a history of the laser, and then wander around for another hundred pages without ever mentioning the subject again?    Maybe an alien craft DID crash at Roswell.  Maybe Corso, years later, had custody of some of the debris.  Maybe he really did secretly show these treasures to key scientists, thus speeding along our technological development.  May be.  Or maybe not.      Strom Thrumond, in his foreword to this book, never says it is so.  He only says Corso is a fine man.  \\"I am certain he has many interesting stories to share.\\"  Hardly a ringing confirmation that aliens were once probably poised to trigger a nuclear war.    This book is tantalizing, teasing, and worth reading, but in the end, deeply disappointing.
B000002P5R|4.0|First off, I'm going to have to agree with The Invisible Man a few reviews up about the instrumental \\"Beginnings.\\"  I think that another selection should have been made...\\"Pali Gap\\" comes to mind. <br /> <br />And secondly (this is very trivial), but I feel that Jimi's Experience really is forgotten about...Mitchell and Cox were just as big a part of these recordings as Hendrix was.  I think that they almost never get the credit that they deserve. <br /> <br />Third, I will also have to agree with Danno a few reviews up that this is really the only posthumous CD that you have to have, although I would highly recommend The Jimi Hendrix Experience Box Set too (the cream of the posthumous crop, in my opinion).  That said, \\"Hendrix in the West\\" and \\"Rainbow Bridge\\" are also must-haves for any real Hendrix fan (you'll have to either get imports or buy off of eBay), so I don't think that this is the only posthumous compilation that you should purchase if you're interested. <br /> <br />I was very satisfied with the purchase of this CD...unlike some of these people, I didn't really notice any flaws in sound, but then again, perhaps I just don't have an ear for it.  I had \\"The Cry of Love\\" on cassette but it was garbage (the tape quality was crap), so I picked this up.  I initially thought that it would just be like \\"The Cry of Love\\" with bonus tracks, but I was wrong.  Aside from containing the entire \\"Cry of Love\\" LP, this has some really good tracks like \\"Hey Baby,\\" \\"Room Full of Mirrors,\\" and \\"Dolly Dagger,\\" just to name a few.  (Most of the \\"bonus tracks\\" can be found on \\"Rainbow Bridge.\\") <br /> <br />If you stop and think, given what Jimi's posthumous crew had to work with, I think they did a damn fine job of cranking this one out.  I give it four stars if only because it wasn't Hendrix's project from start to finish, so it lacks a little something.  Other than that though, this album is definitely worth the money and certainly worth at least one listen.  I would definitely recommend this one to any Hendrix fan.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|First off, let me say this cd is best heard using a decent pair of headphones! There is a LOT going on, much of it very subtle or quiet- headphones really bring all the soundscapes to life. This is a great cd- from the first listen I was blown away. Many are comparing it to other RP releases, but I find each RP release is a complete and distinct entity. The intermingling of music and lyrics is fresh and exciting. For those who complain that this is not like Led Zeppelin or early RP I suggest you re-visit the back catalogues. You will see that RP is staying true to both style and form without rehashing the past and becoming stale. I read one reviewer who said that RP is established and can do whatever he wants musically now. Hasn't he always? Do we WANT artists to make music solely for sales of records? Sorry- I find the best music comes from an artist doing exactly what they want to do instead of trying to be a pop sensation. Britney and the backstreet boys have their place, but I prefer music as art for the sake of art. If it sells- great. If not oh well. I have a strong feeling that is exactly what RP would say. Again- a great CD. Only a few cds recently have really grabbed me from the very first listen (Peter Gabriel Up is one of those cds- get it too while you are at it). Good listening!
B0000630BT|5.0|Hmm...Can you say FANTASTIC?  This album is very very well done.  A favorite of my collection.  I'd have to say either Painkiller or All Guns Blazing is my favorite track.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album kills. <br /> <br />The hooks are abundant, the melodies are great and I can't get it out of my CD player.  Some people may complain about the short duration, but do you really want to wade through 30 minutes of filler material like most bands give you?  Hell no!  Give me the good stuff and give it to me quick; that's what this CD does.  It rocks and it soars and it makes me want more. <br /> <br />Lyrically, it's the same old game; nothing great, but who cares when the music rocks like this?  Oh, yeah; if you have a talented lead singer, you should probably use him more often. <br /> <br />Contender for album of the year.
B00004TJKI|2.0|Anatomy of a Murder is a fine movie. Too bad it is not presented on DVD in its original widescreen aspect ratio. But you won't know that by looking at Amazon's ads for it...no where can you find this is a Full Screen edition. In fact, you can bet that Amazon now never informs the public that new DVDs are in Full Screen. <br /> <br />The 2 stars are for the Full Screen, not the film itself.
0679735909|5.0|I never thought Possession would be the gripping, breathtaking novel it is when I first started reading it. After zipping through the first half , however, I began to realize Possession was more than just a romance, or just a critique on Victorian literature. The story is about two Victorian researchers, Maud and Roland who stumble upon a letter written by reputed Victorian Poet Ash, an uncontroversial figure believed to have led a smooth, rather bland, life. What follows is a series of inter-related clues that lead the two researchers into an unsolved literary mystery, which points on to a romantic relationship between Ash and a lesser known poet Christabel. The plot is taut and beautifully balanced and goes on to discuss the sexual-mores of the Victorians; their suppressions; their cravings.   <br /> <br />The way the incidents fall in to place, perfectly, makes the story rather improbable at times, but the beauty of the whole novel is in its stunning imagery and the way the romance between the two Victorian poets blends with that of the two scholars who try to unravel the mysterious relationship between them. The balanced, masterly ending, unlike many books of today, is a real treat. The first half may not be very interesting, but once you cross the first half, the book is simply addictive.   <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|Is it me, or was just about everything a lot cooler in the past? For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs. <br /> <br />But I digress. \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", to the epic \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", the beautifully written semi-ballad \\"Fade To Black\\", and, of course, the metal classic \\"Creeping Death\\", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album! <br /> <br />Anyway, yeah, this one's a classic. Buy it, and steer clear of emo!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I'm really excited to see this great film finally make its debut on dvd; it's been a long wait.     John Waters has proven himself time and time again as America's avatar of bad taste and all things tacky, but he sidelined his more base urges for a greater good over a decade ago. Starting with Hairspray, Waters essentially re-created the American musical, and honed that to perfection with the castly underappreciated Cry-Baby. But it's not just a musical - it's also a heartfelt valentine to a simpler time, his beloved Baltimore of the late 1950's.    Depp stars as \\"Cry-Baby\\" Walker, a juvenile delinquent from the wrong side of the tracks who spends his time hanging with his gang and singing that evil rock n' roll music. He and his way of life are constantly threatened by the town 'Squares' who are both threatened and repelled by Cry-Baby and those like him.     Naturally, he falls for a Square girl and all hell breaks loose. That part of it is a simple story, and I won't waste time rehashing or giving it away here. No, what really stands out about this film is its gleeful embrace of 'white-trash culture,' its loving tribute to the great juvenile delinquent movies of the 50's and 60's, and its rambunctious energy.     As usual, Waters peppers the film with eclectic casting; Susan Tyrell, Iggy Pop, Ricki Lake, Mink Stole, Joe Dalessandro, Willem Dafoe, David Nelson (son of Ozzie), Traci Lords and Patty Hearst (yes, that Patty Hearst) are just a few of the many talents that form this wonderful ensemble cast. And of course, it's another one of Depp's great iconoclastic roles that have helped define him as one of the great idiosyncratic actors of our time.     So grab yourself an RC Cola, a Moon Pie, and put yer teeth up on the windowsill while y'all enjoy this trashy good time. You'll thank me for it and if y'all don't like it, I'll eat me a bug.
B0007GAERG|5.0|For all you haters out there, this album is excellent.  The material is mature and to the point.  Her vocals are flawless.  Just listen to the air control.  Every song has a special quality to it.  She is not a washed up dog whistle.  Seems to me, the ones that don't like this album just don't understand it.  And probably wish that you could sing just like her.
0790749858|4.0|As a long time lover of the Looney Tunes, I had to have this movie. I must admit to a bit of dissapointment in that the cartoon charaters were NOT all that they could have been. It seems like the glory days of Warner Bros. is really over. That being said, it was still an entertaining movie. <br /> <br />The premise involves a theme part from another planet that wants to capture the \\"toons\\" to bring in more customers. Bugs and company notice that the aliens sent to get them are all very short and gawky and challenge them to a basketball game. The aliens manage to steal the talent of NBA stars and grow to huge proportions. The toons need help so Michael Jordan is drafted from his baseball career to save the day. Anyone who has ever seen a sports movie can guess how it turns out but the point is the twists and turns along the way. <br /> <br />Another commentator said that these toons are pale imitations of their predecessors. THat person was right. Still its better than nothing and it was a fun movie.
0596007124|4.0|I have to admit, I was prepared to dislike this book. It has a sassy attitude, the cartoony style, and a page layout more like a pinball machine than a textbook. \\"It could be worse,\\" I told myself, \\"it could have been in color.\\"<br /><br />OK, I'm wrong a lot. This actually does have technical content in it. Good technical content, better than lots of other books. For example, they not only deal with Singleton and thread saftey, they talk about Java 1.5 and synchronization. They even got the volatile declaration right! No, they don't explain it except to say that you need it, but at least it's there. The description of statically initialized singletons doesn't describe the circumstances where it may fail (in multiple classes with mutually dependent static initializers), but they mention static init. The machine control code used as an example couldn't restart after a power failure, but the pattern is handled well. And, on the whole, they handle other patterns with equal, pragmatic care.<br /><br />There's a lot of blank space on most pages, so the 600-some read like less - a lot less. Cartoons, cartoony photos, and gratuitous thought balloons occupy most of most pages. It's consistent, though, and encodes information fairly clearly. I don't know their right names, but some characters recur throughout the book. There's the \\"Yeah, But\\" lady, who points out problems and inconsistencies. There's The Guru with her mystical pronunciamenti and her conversations with \\"Grasshopper.\\" (Do these readers actually remember the Kung Fu TV series?) There's the \\"What If\\" lady and the Geek Guy. Another book might have sidebars of different sorts, but these characters each narrate one kind of point worth extra mention.<br /><br />Example code is generally good. One problem with sample code is that students often get wrapped up in the synthetic problem being solved, and forget that the code is meant to illustrate some other point. These samples serve the structural purposes well enough, but will never be mistaken for serious applications.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fluffy format leaves about half of the GoF patterns to one- or two-page descriptions in an appendix. This includes some of my workhorses, like \\"Prototype\\" and \\"Chain of Responsibility\\", and an inadequate version of \\"Interpreter.\\" Like so many other authors, they get caught up in the text-processing problems tangential to the pattern and ignore its real meaning: composition of complex actions from simpler ones.<br /><br />I might actually recommend this for an undergrad course, at least as one among several texts. What content it has is good stuff, in a basic presentation, and a format suited to the Gameboy generation.<br /><br />//wiredweirdaken for serious applications.

B000005RRF|5.0|I got this album in Egypt, in the late 1980s, from a friend there who was up on European bands. From there, I took the cassette on all my travels; it is one of those rare albums you want to listen to-in entirety-dozens of times in a row.<br /><br />Marillion's songs (on this album; I've not heard their others) have the haunting quality of some Alan Parsons, and the first album by Pearl Jam. Because there are no strong breaks between songs, this seems to be a \\"theme\\" album, in the vein of \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"...here the theme is stream-of-consciousness reminiscences. Listening while reading the lyrics bears this out, such as when the last lines of \\"Lost Weekend\\" segue into the subject of \\"Blue Angel\\".<br /><br />If nothing musical has \\"electrified\\" you in awhile, get this album! It won't be cheap, because its an import, but it will be worth it. I just got a CD, because my cassette was worn clear out; and the music is as beautiful as ever.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|Although I understand that J. M. Barrie was not perfect, there is no reason to relate him to the \\"Michael Jackson\\" scandal. It might be true that he *was* a pedophile, but in this movie, nothing of the sort was shown. The movie is *based* upon events that happened in the past, but is not a documentary of any sort or kind, and therefore cannot be deemed untruthful. Since the movie is not a historical film, nor does it portray any sort of pedophilia, it is unjust to give this movie a bad review for the past events. <br /> <br />Depp came across as a truly kind being who became very close with a family, and especially with that family's kids. He enjoyed being around them because maybe he felt that they needed a father figure, or maybe that he saw himself in the children and just wanted to have fun with them because he had no children of his own. Depp played Barrie in a manner which might have not been accurate, but his performance was amazing. <br /> <br />Winslet, who as well gives a rather good performance, fits with Depp like pieces of a puzzle, and the dynamics between Depp and the boys are amazing in all scenarios. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a stunning movie, and never you mind the reviews that say that this film was boring or stupid. This brings out emotion in almost everyone, from kids to seniors, and the only people who don't find it interesting are those who dislike a movie that actually has a good plot/doesn't have \\"action\\"/actually has in-depth characters. <br /> <br />I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT YOU PUT THIS ON THE TOP OF YOUR LIST TO RENT OR BUY. I GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU WATCH IT ONCE, JUST ONCE, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT IMMEDIATELY.
B000059QYB|4.0|Greatest hit collections are a dime a dozen these days and some of them aren't as complete as we'd like them to be.  However Billy Idols Greatest Hits is a comprehensive collection of songs spanning his career.  From his Gen X days to the ill fated Cyberpunk album this is a fairly definitive collection of Idol's material. <br /> <br />\\"Eyes Without A Face\\" and \\"Catch My Fall\\" are easily some of Billy's most creative and beautiful songs. <br />\\"Cradle Of Love\\" over time, has not lost it's luster or charm.   <br />I especially liked the live acoustic version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" and even moreso Keith Forsey's: \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" (as I understand it Keith Forsey actually wrote this song for Billy to perform back in the 80's before it was offered up to Simple Minds).   <br /> <br />I felt the Idol/Stevens team rocked Forsey's song out in great style and form.  It was a perfect ending to Idol's Greatest Hits, and this CD is worth buying just for that one song alone. <br />Two thumbs up for this collection of songs. <br /> <br />
B0002CHHMA|5.0|Bruni's sensual voice and the light melody of the guitar make these songs easy to listen to and quite enjoyable throughout, whether you parlez francais or not. Bruni gives the whole album a rather personal feel because her voice directs the songs, rather than having guitar, drums or bass. Each melody is beautiful, as the songs are well structured themselves, but the overall musical arrangement makes you want to whistle, hum, or even sing along.  <br /> <br />One might compare her to Avril Lavigne, and the like, but their voices don't reach to what Bruni can achieve. Lavigne and the others seem to feel it's rather necessary to have a guitar pasted on top of their voice to achieve a good sounding song, but in reality, voice is king (or queen). <br /> <br />I highly recommend that you choose to listen to the previews on Amazon, download songs from iTunes, Napster, MusicMatch, or even buy the CD, because it's a decision you won't regret.
1400032717|5.0|This is Mark Haddon's first novel and it turned out to be an excellent one. It is a wonderful story written as a first-person account by an autistic young man, Christopher. I don't want to give away the story but, it reads like a blog. It has a lot of interesting facts,  illustrations and puzzles. It is a fun read. Very different.
B000000WCA|4.0|So here I am watching TV with my wife and the new I-POD commercial comes on and what do they play in the background but Wannabe by the Spice Girls and all of a sudden my memory is flushed with all these great times I spent when I was 13 with my friends.  WE LOVED THE SPICE GIRLS....I know I know, sad isn't it...a bunch of 13 year old boys singing \\"If you wannabe my lover\\" is kinda weird, but we didn't think so at the time.  Anyways, after seeing the commercial I had to get the cd, you know, for old times sake, and I'm glad I did...It's nice to be able to just sit and laugh because this kind of music will make you remember better, simpler times...It's great.  Thank you I-POD for making me remember!
B00008A7QK|5.0|On this classic, breakthrough record, Marc Bolan miraculously manages to pull something fresh and durable out of a Pandora's box of rock clichs: Nearly every song is a gritty variation of standard twelve-bar blues; the lyrics are about sex; the rhythms are beaten out with bongos and hand claps; the strings and sax are prog holdovers; and the raspy, elfin vocals-though distinctive-are delivered in a fey manner that shamelessly rips-off David Bowie. But the total effect is spellbinding. There is so much fun, attitude, and magic in this album that it continues to surprise and stimulate musicians and fans alike.  <br /> <br />How T. Rex conjure their glamorous originality is a secret Bolan took to an early grave. But who really wants to know how a trick is done? Better to just sit back and marvel!  <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This has to be the best movie ever made!  A wonderful rendition of ALW's magical stage play I can find zero fault with it.  Some say Gerry Butler is no Michael Crawford, which is true.  Michael was the perfect stage choice where singing voice is everything (incidentally, when he got that gig, he was a total un-known, acting on a BBC 1/2hr comedy show.  No one knew he could sing).  However, his acting ability is not suited for the silver screen.  I submit his performance in the forgettable Disney's \\"Condor Man\\" as evidence of that.  Gerry brought just the right edginess in his singing voice which combined with his superb acting talents resulted in the definitive Phantom performance.  Emmy was angelic.  Minnie was the perfect Diva, and Pat Wilson fleshed out Raoul as a real he-man.      The most striking message that comes screaming though in the movie is lonliness.  All the major characters are desparate for companionship which eludes them most of their lives.  Even the lone deer running along Raoul's carriage symolizes that theme.  That makes Christine and Raoul's true love even more impactful.    This goes on the shelf next to Family Vacation, the Pink Panther series, American Graffiti, and Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as often watches.    After seeing it 6 times in the theater and 3 times on one of my 3 DVDs, the only flaw I can find is Christine goes to sleep to Music of the Night in Phantoms lair with her panty-hose on and wakes up with them off.  Probably had to get up during the night to pee I guess.    PS.  I keep editing this!  The new song \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" was mis-interpreted, otherwise would have been a sure Oscar winner.  It took me a while to figure out why it didn't quite work in the movie but then it dawned on me - it was done as a 60s folk tune!  It is backed up with a single guitar and bongo drum which just doesn't go with the rest of the lush score.  The tune was much better in the \\"No One Will Listen\\" deleted scene with full orchestration.
B00005V0X5|5.0|In my opinion, owning every single Megadeth album that was released.  I think \\"KIMB\\" is an outstanding debut.  Dave Mustaine put the screws to Metallica with \\"Mechanix.\\"  Which is a way better version, then \\"4 Horsemen.\\"  C'mon guys, use your own song!  If you like metal, or want to hear what real metal is, go with MegadetH!  Also, any musician will appreciate this album along with any other.  The shredding is unbelievable at times, especially on \\"Peace Sells...but whos buying\\", they're second and arguably best album, it also has the most famous bass-line in all of music in the intro to \\"Peace Sells.\\"  All in all, I highly suggest MegadetH to anyone who is willing to give a listen, also, pick up cryptic writings if your not into the intense stuff.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Beauty and the Beast's \\"Human Again\\" carries a cute scene between Belle and Beast but is ultimately unnecessary; The Lion King's \\"Morning Report\\" appears out of place and painfully disrupts the flow of the film; Pocahontas' \\"If I Never Knew You\\", however, is exactly what the movie needed to be complete. <br /> <br />A duet never should have been left out in the first place, \\"If I Never Knew You\\" is a melodically poetic, lyrically poignant exchange of singing dialog that authenticates Pocahontas and John Smith's feelings for each other, speaking of how lacking life would be if they never knew each other.  The reprise well placed near the end of the film also dose a great job at evoking strong emotions and adds power to the bittersweet ending of this courageous romantic tale. <br /> <br />If I had only one misgiving about this effort, however minor, it would be that the animation accompanying the beautiful music had some room for improvement.  There are a few moments there where the two leads look just a little bit \\"off\\" (not looking like themselves), especially in John Smith's case.  Other than that, the added sequences are simply stunning.  I especially love the segment where the \\"camera\\" moves from John Smith's looking up at the nightly sky to Pocahontas' paddling away towards Grandmother Willow's canopy.  Trying not to give away anything, I'll just say that it has a lot of magic and symbolic meaning while echoing an earlier scene in the movie. <br /> <br />All in all, this special 10th anniversary edition of Pocahontas is a marvelous venture worthy of the Disney name and the love and loyalty of its fans.  Now that I've seen this version of the film I will never go back to the original, for this is what it always should have been. <br />
055357342X|5.0|This third (and best up to that point) installment was a great cliff hanger. The only downside to it is that we're still waiting (years later!) for the next book to pick up the story!!
B00005G8NH|4.0|This was a good album it took a few spins to really get into it but if you give a chance you'll like it...but it does have a different vibe than the 1st... but still a good \\"used\\" purchase.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Let's just start this short review with a simple statement; this record is genius. As previous reviewers have stated, the first Gorillaz record was rather difficult to fathom initially, but this one is  a plug-and-play appreciative record. On first listen from the second that the record started playing in my CD player, I was hooked. This is greatly in part to the record's famous producer in hip-hop and alternative rap production, DJ Danger Mouse (creator of the infamous Grey Album). <br />The beat patterns and structures on the record are amazing, simply put. Danger Mouse and the rest of the Gorillaz Partnership experiment with some of the craziest and most inventive rhythms I have ever heard on a popular record. For example, on Each Planet We Reach Is Dead, the group goes from a furious trip-hop beat style into an inventive jazz pattern that complements the track well, and finally helps hip-hop realize that using such beats can be done. <br />The words are equally as clever and poignant as anything else that Albarn or the Gorillaz have previously done, and with the combination of Danger Mouse's experimentation with very obscure synths and sounds the record is a display of ingenuity that has been long overdue.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Undoubtedly, this is the best work made by Marillion in all time. Other albuns are excellent as well, such as Holidays, Season's, Afraid of, Anoraknofobia, but Marbles is \\"out of this world\\".   There are just 2 songs that I didn't like: Marbles I and Drilling Holes. The rest is wonderful, especially Neverland, Angelina, Don't Hurt Yourself, You're Gone and Fantastic Place.  Imagine if you get the double album, it would be fantastic.  Now I got it and DVD MARBLES ON THE ROAD TOO. All my expectations were surpassed (increased). I really agree with other reviewers that is the best album of 2004. The tracks Only Unforgivable Things, Genie and Ocean Cloud are excellent as well.  I desagree with those reviewers who compare Marbles with Brave, that I consider the worst work from Marillion after Fish era.
B00082IJ08|5.0|What a follow up!  This album is genious!  Every track is fitting, and well placed... Way to go Damon & Co.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I have been a Metheny Group fan since I first heard \\"Still Life (Talking)\\" and \\"The First Circle\\" in the mid-80's.  These guys always find melodies and changes that sound so logical they seem almost obvious, both when they really are obvious and when they are something we have never heard.  For those of us who crave the \\"new\\" part of the equation, the transitional segments that occasionally pop up towards the end of medium-length compositions like Minuano (Six-Eight), The First Circle, And Then I Knew, or Lyle Mays' Highland Aire are like that whiff of pine-scented air you sometimes catch in the spring. <br /> <br />May I present an entire cedar forest.  Flawless, exhilarating performances, crisp and rich recording, and composition that you can get lost in after repeated listening.  Music that is both cerebral and moving.  The Group doing what they were always capable of, but never inclined to do before: a work that's long but not stretched, organized but not predictable, tonal but not too sweet, exciting but not raw, thematic but not repetitious.
B0006AZMFM|5.0|Delta Goodrem is Australia's latest music sensation. Her original album \\"Innocent Eyes\\" achieved a near recordbreaking 14x planium, plus an unprecedented six consequtive #1 songs.  <br /> <br />So when Delta, just 18 at the time, took time out to recover from cancer, Australia was eager to hear her experiences through her beautiful music in this highly anticipated album. True to her gorgeous style, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" is a near perfect album, which indeed reflects off her illness, but also love and life in general.  <br /> <br />Already, this album includes three top ten singles, two of those in fact debuting at #1 on the Australian Music Charts. On top of these successes, the album itself triple-platniumed in its first week on sale. It went on to gain two more platniums. \\"Mistaken Identity\\" is a trully stunning collection of songs. <br /> <br />I don't think I'll review each song in great depth, simply because everyone has unique opinions and tastes. However I shall give my personal top five. They would have to be: <br /> <br />1) The Analyst <br />2) Last Night on Earth <br />3) Extraordinary Day <br />4) Out of the Blue <br />5) Almost Here <br /> <br />Of course, everyone will have different \\"Top 5s\\" but statisticly, these five tend to be the favourites among fans. Just a quick note on some of the songs; \\"Extraordinary Day\\" is in fact a song about the very day Delta found about her cancer. It is a trully haunting song, and a very valid song too, as it depicts the emotions of many human-beings who may have experienced such an illness. Also, \\"Almost Here\\" is infact a duet Delta did with former Westlife member Brian McFadden. Delta and Brian were brought together as a couple because of this song. Those two \\"FYIs\\" weren't \\"helpful\\" as such, but I just thought I'd let you on in some of the messages and secrets locked away in these brilliant songs! <br /> <br />Delta Goodrem is a breath of fresh air from these other so-called artists, possessing genuine talent. Through her uplifting melodies and metaphorical lyrics, Delta expresses a somewhat innocent outlook on life. There is no denying the immense gift of this young girl. Her songs have inspired many, and her bubbly, friendly spirit in real life really add shine to this great album. There is no mistaking the fact that Delta Goodrem is here to stay!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This was the first R rated movie I ever saw (eight years old in Miami with my grandparents), and I was blown away. Apparently my grandparents thought A Star is Born was going to be a cutesy bit of schmaltz starring Barbra, their avenging angel, and instead it turned into a vaguely sexy cookie cutter tragedy with the 70s west coast hard core soft rock scene as a backdrop. Sure, Kris's songs sound like Neil Diamond on party drugs, and La Streisand is witty, frizzy, and basically plays herself as usual. The screenplay is by Didion and Dunne, so ASIB should have been a scathing stare into the real California music scene of the 70s, but the dry, jaundiced vibe D&D are famous for got stepped on & dumbed down somewhere before the final print...still, despite its shortcomings, A Star is Born is one of the great rock musicals of the 70s. Kris's John Norman Howard (that is so not a rock star name) is a ravishing alkie disaster; elegantly wasted and timelessly chic in his hippie biker clothes...Barbra's Esther wears a lot of gossamer ponchos and looks silly. ASIB trivia: Barbra wanted Elvis to play Kris's part, but E was already on the skids and couldn't get it together. Kris and Barbra did not get along at all, and their offscreen hate sparks made their onscreen relationship into napalm. Up to you if napalm is good or bad.<br /><br />Finally bubeleh, a DVD worth buying. I obviously need to see ASIB again. Dig the Montrose riff (\\"Rock Candy\\") that opens the outdoor festival concert scene. All the songs on this errant masterpiece are awesome.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave is still at the start of what's to come. althought, these guys came off as a solid super group with not much inspiration to me with their first offering. They just didn't seem like a real group. It was kinda hard listening to a band that the band members don't even seem like they would be drinking buddies even with their tremendous talent. But it was good enough to keep me interested in this album so i bought it. And in my opion they are probably one of only a few solid rock bands out there. They definitly seemed to have come together as a tighter group, it shows on whole album. And we need more bands like this that mtv and the radio doesn't shove down our throats too much. There's no need to mention their past accomplishments they have proven they can rock and are among the greatest of our time. Check it out.
B00000K3CM|4.0|In the first movie, the shovel man is a good, innocent, old neighborhood man.  In the second movie, the pigeon woman is a dirty, potentially dangerous homeless person.  To, from a storytelling point, say that his fear of both is equally irrational is ridiculous.  I would be freakin's scared of the pigeon woman.  (Not really a kid)
0316011789|1.0|common what was i thinking,it took me only a few seconds after the purchase of this audio cd to realize i must be a complete idiot,sure enough when i listened to it later that night  i was right i was indeed a fool. should have went with my gut feeling,the real title of this book or cd should be titled common sense. im glad i saved the reciept,cause this baby's going back to the store its nothing but useless information and common sense i think mr gladwell did a hit of acid before his research on this book .save your money, mr gladwell talks about thin slices every five minutes it really made me hungry i just wish i spent the money on a pizza instead.
B0007TKNII|5.0|First off, I will admit I have never seen the Broadway production but I have listened to the Broadway  soundtrack for years. I could spot every word change of every song in the movie. But they were all changes for the better, I believe. <br />I was afraid after all these years of wondering what it would be like to finally see the songs I loved be performed on screen, I might be disappointed, but I definately wasn't. I believe this will go into my collection, as one of my most prized DVDs.  <br />Emmy Rossum was incredible as Christine. Her voice was flawless. Minnie Driver was comedic as Carlotta. The only thing that disappointed me a bit, at first, was that Gerard Butler was, as was quoted in another review here, \\"the man who was NOT Michael Crawford\\". His voice was very different from Crawford's but I do not believe Crawford could have given the sensual performance that Butler did. I really would have had a hard time chosing, had I been Christine, between the Phantom and Raoul. All in all, I think Gerard Butler did a great job. <br />The backdrop of the theater and surroundings were so eerie, yet beautiful. I think my favorite part was Christine singing \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" in that cemetary setting. Very haunting. <br />I just wish I could thank Joel Schumacher for bringing all the spectacle of the Broadway musical into my home, as I am  someone who, I am sure, will never see it performed on the stage.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Honestly, I've been waiting a while for this CD, and I'm very satisfied. All of these songs have the same trademark sound of Audioslave (and RATM a bit).  <br /> <br />Your Time Has Come - Second single, it's okay. 8/10 <br /> <br />Out Of Exile - I really don't like the beat at the very beginning and that comes back at the end. But other than that, this song is great! Resembles \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" a little.  9/10 <br /> <br />Be Yourself - First single. This song could have been much better if there were better lyrics. \\"Be yourself is all that you can do\\" kind of gets old after the first chorus. 8/10 <br /> <br />Doesn't Remind Me - In my opinion, the worst song on the album. The only good parts are at \\"The things that I love...\\" when it starts rocking. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />Drown Me Slowly - Good bass line. 8/10 <br /> <br />Heaven's Dead - Similar to \\"Runaway Car\\". Nothing too special. 8/10 <br /> <br />The Worm - I know a lot of people love Morello's out-there solos, but this one doesn't click. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Man of Animal - Fast paced. 8/10 <br /> <br />Yesterday to Tomorrow - Best song on the album. Cornell does a great job singing, and the whole thing just goes together really well. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Dandelion - I like the \\"oooooooh\\". 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Number 1 Zero - I like the abnormal guitar slurs that not many other bands do. 8/10 <br /> <br />The Curse - Probably the second best, but there's nothing too special about it. The chords are great though, that's what I like. Nice ending. 9/10 <br /> <br />The self-titled album beats this one not by too much, but Out Of Exile is still a great CD and a must buy for Audioslave fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0393324818|5.0|I never understood nor really liked baseball.  I bought the book mostly to read about the inspired use of statistics, and the creative thinking that went into looking for the real keys to victory.  I can safely say that while I may not have fallen in love with baseball, I will never find it boring again.  If you have someone you want to turn into a fan, this book a superb gift option.  The amount of detail in this book--for example, just the description of the strike zone and what different pitches and batters do to narrow the zone, what can be known about specific individual propensities and vulnerabilities associated with that little box, are truly inspirational.<br /><br />This is a really excellent book.  If we managed the national security budget the way Billy Bean managed the Oakland A's, we'd have faster better cheaper military hardware, and a lot more plowshares.  I was also impressed by the way in which Billy Bean built a team, in which players who might not have been individual stars excelled at setting up others in a true team effort where the group as a whole is stronger than the sum of the parts.  Others have written better reviews from a baseball fans point of view--as a non-baseball fan, I can attest to this book's being an \\"aha\\" experience.<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:0307280322 Watching Baseball Smarter: A Professional Fan's Guide for Beginners, Semi-experts, and Deeply Serious Geeks]]
B00082IJ08|5.0|Finally, it's here. I got it as soon as it was avalible on iTunes, around 12:30 AM. I just couldn't wait until morning.  <br /> <br />Anyway, my personal oddities aside, time for the review. I wrote as I listened for the first time, so I have not really had a chance to listen to it over and over again like I surely will. <br /> <br /> Are We The Last Living Souls?  <br /> <br />Goodness, I love this song. The intro eventually breaks into a very simple but effective drum beat, in which 2-D continues to ask \\"Are we the last living souls?\\" Though a very simple song, It's a very fun listen. As it runs down to the end, it breaks into a little acoustic riff that really rounds it off well. A great way to start off the album. As with  Oh, Green World  this is one of their best songs. <br /> <br /> Kids With Guns  <br /> <br />A very nice bass line in this, and everything works out well. Even simpler than the first track, this is another really good one. I love the chorus, which wraps the whole song in a nice little package. Only thing I didn't like was the female background, but that was only in a few areas, and it isn't  that  bad, it would have just been better without it. Another great song, though I don't like it as much as the first. <br /> <br /> Oh, Green World  <br /> <br />Starts off fairly different, but I love what it goes into. A mix of beeps, bass drum, and a mixture of odd sound effects, this one starts off sounding really good. Then 2-D breaks in through the static, with a good set of lyrics and the moaning and groaning of the everyone else in the background. When I got the album sampler a few days ago, this was one of the songs I really wanted to hear full length. It isn't a dissapointment, and it's one of the best Gorillaz have ever put out there. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry  <br /> <br />A very upbeat and happy tune that I always enjoy hearing again. I bought the single awhile back, and it fits perfectly into the mix. It's a very solid and entertaining songthat's been stuck onto my playlist for quite some time.  <br /> <br /> Feel Good Inc.  <br /> <br />The video is great, and the song is even greater. Man, I love this song. A perfect pick for the single, everytime this comes on, I can't help but turn up the volume just a little louder. I'm sure you've all heard it, so I won't really go into specifics, but this is one of the best on the album. I continue to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> El Manana  <br /> <br />From the name of the title, I was expecting another  Simone , a track I really didn't like, but instead, I was really surprised. Everything flows together, and it's nice to hear them experimenting with what sounded so well on  Slow Country . Like this one a lot.  <br /> <br /> Every Planet We Reach Is Dead  <br /> <br />Another mellow song like the one before it, almost flowing directly from it. Works very well. Once again, there's a female background, and it does sort of take away from it...But not as much to take away from the enjoyment of the track itself. I enjoy this track a lot, especially when the piano breaks in. Very effective, very different, and very good.  <br /> <br /> November Has Come  <br /> <br />I'm not one for anything involving rap, but like in  Clint Eastwood , I must make an exception. I love everything this track has to offer, and it's one of the best on the entire album. I love 2D's voicework on this in conjuction with the main verses, and now I'm starting to enjoy the background vocals. They work better in this song than in any one thus far. This one will be on heavy rotation for sure. <br /> <br /> All Alone  <br /> <br />A much faster and inventive track comes up out of nowhere, and I don't think I'm really into this one. I'll give them credit for trying something that doesn't sound what they normally do, but this is for sure the weakest track on the album. In no ways is it  horrible , It's still decent. I do like it, however, when Noodle sings for a short bit, but that's the only part I really like. Oh well. They can't all be great. <br /> <br /> White Light  <br /> <br />All I heard was \\"White Light\\" repeated over and over again, but...I like this. I can't really go into details, since there isn't much to go into, but I'm really nodding my head as I listen to it. It's sort of confusing the way it just exits, but it's a really cool listen. Not one of the best on the CD, but still a good one. <br /> <br /> Dare  <br /> <br />Another  Dirty Harry  right here, and this one is just as good. I'm not usually one to enjoy any form of techno/dance music, but I'm really enjoying this. A nice mixture of a variety of instruments, it sure seems like they took this on very carefully. Well, it works out just great. I must say this is one of the strongest tracks on this CD.  <br /> <br /> Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head  <br /> <br />Wow, this is an odd one. A spoken word track by Dennis Hopper? Well, who cares? This is great stuff. You'll just have to take a listen, just something about it...A very good listen. <br /> <br /> Don't get lost in Heaven  <br /> <br />Easily one of the best tracks on the album. It reminded me of a mix between a slow love ballad and a dance tune, but whatever you would classify it as, It's a great song. <br /> <br /> Demon Days  <br /> <br />I was sad to see it was almost over. It goes out perfectly. A fitting track to end it all. Couldn't have done it any better.  <br /> <br />Overall, they have accomplished what they set out to do. It meets my expectations, and doesn't dissapoint me a bit. In many ways, it's a better album than their self titled. I'll keep listening to this for a very long time, and it's easily one of my favorite albums I've ever listened to. The only track I didn't like was  All Alone , but every other one was at least good. That's a pretty high rating if you ask me. They aren't for everyone, but if you're one of the many who find talent in these guys, you'll share many of the feelings I do. The album all flows together perfectly, making a really good album. Really good.  <br /> <br />Get it. Now.
B0008ISM40|2.0|After NIN's overly ambitious ( and barely memorable )  double album The Fragile  tanked five years ago, Trent Reznor I'm sure took a long hard look at the state of his music  and realised \\"hey...I need a HIT!\\"  Unfortunately, despite all the \\"return to form\\" pre-release hype that surrounded \\"With Teeth\\" I have found out very simply .... this ain't it. After producing some of the most thought provoking and thrill inducing  music of the nineties ( NIN's Broken and the Downward Spiral remain two of the favourite releases of the decade ), Trent here relies on the same set of cliched, high-school-poetry, angst-ridden lyrics, and props them up against some of the most unoriginal and uninspiring music he has ever produced. If you're thinking this will put you back on the road to relevance, think again, Trent. Your days are numbered, and this is truly the Last Nail in the Coffin. ( By the way, cudos to whomever did your plastic surgery, or the airbrushing on your publicity photos - congratulations, Peter Pan, you STILL don't look a day over 30...)
B000929AJQ|5.0|I have listened to 'With Teeth' over 20 times and have to say, simply, it is better than expected.  People change, styles change, and this work shows Trent has definitely changed in the last 5 years.  'Only' and 'Right Where it Belongs' are good examples of this.  A new and improved Reznor, awake in the dream.  It will be interesting to see what's next, when a dark and angry Trent is not so angry, leaves his self-imposed isolation to relocate in sunny California (SPIN-May'05 issue), and no longer makes every day exactly the same.  Well worth the wait.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Whilst indie bands ungroom their hair and straighten their slim ties, and the mainstream rock audience pre-orders Coldplay's upcoming third album, the real concern right now is: who will urgently deliver a set of songs infused with freshness and originality?  <br /> <br />Win Butler, sporting waistcoat and a Huck Finn haircut, leads the charge like some barefoot magnifico. This is Arcade Fire's debut album. The strength of this album lies not only in its welcome mishmash of xylophone, violin, and guitars or the wonderful quirkiness that weaves its way through the 10 songs, but also its sheer consistency. This is a very good collection of songs.  <br /> <br />If the Pulp-esque \\"Crown Of Love\\" and the opening track \\"Neighbourhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" do not quite hit the mark, the purpose-driven wailing of Win Butler soon wins us over on \\"Neighbourhood #2 (Laika)\\". The melancholy \\"Neighbourhood #4 (7 Kettles)\\" will touch hearts. Perhaps the signature tune for this odd sextet from Montreal is \\"Neighbourhood #3 (Power Out)\\" - a frenetic outpouring of heartache/hope as much as energy. There is beauty and sadness in such frenzied chaos. Memories of Talking Heads will also come to the fore.  <br /> <br />\\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" (A Year of Darkness) highlights the background to the recording of this album: the deaths of several friends and family members - hence, also, the title of the album \\"Funeral\\".  <br /> <br />The album finishes strongly with a near-perfect final quartet of songs. The anthemic \\"Wake Up\\" reminds us: \\"Somethin' filled up my heart with nothin'. Someone told me not to cry. But now that I'm older my heart's colder, and I can see that it's a lie.\\" Regine Chassagne sings lead vocal on the harrowingly beautiful \\"In The Backseat\\". She also sings on the standout track of the album, \\"Haiti\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Funeral\\" is a very fine album indeed.
B000000OQF|5.0|Ok. I noticed that my other reviews are sorta short, so I was gonna make this one a lil more longer.  This album is great.  Every song is good.  I mean every song.  I will go more in depth later.  Here are my reviews for the songs. <br /> <br />Welcome To The Jungle--- this song is probably the best opener for an album in metal history. Its Guns N Roses first album and they express how they live and what they are encountering.  L.A. is in fact a jungle.  This was even more so in the 80s. <br /> <br />It's So Easy--- This song is so cool.  The bass lines are Duffs at his best.  It has nice lyrics[ first song in which they say f*** ] which is good in every metal album.  It is not a metal album unless it has f*** in it! <br /> <br />Nightrain--- This is by far the best song to open up a concert with.  They did this on Use Your Illusion Tokyo World Tour.  You can buy these two videos on Amazon.com and your local video store.  They should have it.  This song is great to wake up to.  I dont like waking up at all so you would imagine.  This is axl at his best.  He screams with harmony.  No screechs like me. <br /> <br />Out Ta Get me--- ok. People dont like this song.  Just look at other Amazon reviews.  I dont see how.  This is a song to kick someones ass to.  The guitars are great.  It has one of the best openers in GN'R history.  Its so simple, but so cool.  Its to get you fired up.  The drums are cool.  Axl's voice seems to be sorta \\"out of it\\" in this one. <br /> <br />Mr. Brownstone--- This song is awesome too.  The drums are cool in this one.  It has way-over-the-top lyrics. <br /> <br />Paradise City--- ahhh.... everyone's favorite.  This song is by far the best 2nd best... #1 being Nightrain.  The few songs that I listed are enought to buy it.  The drums are cool.  The guitars are top of the game. <br /> <br />My Michelle--- very catchy tune.  Not much to say about it.. its an awesome filler. <br /> <br />Think About You--- I DONT SEE HOW ANYONE COULD NOT LIKE THIS SONG!  People are saying in other views that this song sucks.  This is better this Mr. Brownstone and everyone likes Mr. Brownstone.  The lyrics are average.  The music is great. <br /> <br />Sweet Child O' Mine--- This song is so awesome.  Everyone that likes music likes this one.  Its top of its game. <br /> <br />You're Crazy--- This one is another one that people dont like.  I still dont know why not.  Awesome tune. <br /> <br />Anything Goes Tonight--- This one is another one.  I like every single track on this record.  Best metal record of the last 80s. <br /> <br />Rocket Queen--- This song is f***n' awesome.  Yes. I cursed in this one.  Anyone who doesn't like this is mental.  Great way to finish an album. <br /> <br />Overall, I would give this album 9.99 out of 10.  I say that and not give it 10 because the cover sucks. lol. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|This CD by Audioslave on Interscope Records is really rockin'! GRIN This band delivers terrific melodies with songs like Heaven's Dead\\" and \\"Dandelion.\\" I especially liked the lyrics of the song entitled \\"#1Zero.\\" People have even said that the song \\"Be Yourself\\" is actually exhilarating with its own graceful poetry! I would have to agree. Cornell's voice is in great shape here; and the sound quality on this CD proves it all the way!<br /><br />Songs that are particularly electric (you know, when you want to shake your head wild and free all over and stomp your feet) include the really cool and instantly awesome \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" \\"The Worm,\\" and the title track, \\"Out Of Exile.\\" I would love to see them do \\"Your Time Has Come\\" in concert! Moreover, guys, the songs \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" and \\"Man Or Animal\\" are also really classy, each in a category of their own! And, as with the first Audioslave CD, how's about that guitar playing? BUT,  then again, at the very same time, notice also the BLUES element in the song \\"#1Zero.\\" So, let me see now, it's electric, rockin', bluesy-it all makes for awesome versatility! You will actually WANT to listen to every single song on this CD!<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good CD and probably one of the better ones of 2005 so far. I would recommend it for Audioslave fans, obviously, as well as fans of great rock and even pop. The blues elements are very well sprinkled into the overall effect this CD will have on you-a whoppin' positive effect! Enjoy it, guys!
B000089HCR|5.0|This album is truely great.  This is by far their best album.  People say the lyrics are not-up-to-perfection, but comparing to other bands, they are on top of there game.  The album came out in mid 80s' so you know its good automatically.  If other bands and albums were this good, then the world would be a better place.  This album kills other genres and proves to be a stomping stone for metal.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|At first listen, you might expect to be confused about where these guys are going with their music.  The lyrics are indeed very repetitive, but listen to the guitars, amazing!  If you actually listen to the whole cd, you understand what SOAD is doing.  They are taking songs you may hear on the radio and saying, \\"you guys really like whats on the radio?  Sure we can do that, no problem.\\"  And then they play a song that says, \\"Eat this up! radio songs are easy and we are going to blow everyone on the radio away with our sound.\\"  They are fighting the radio in their own way.  And for that, I have to give them 5 stars.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This is one of the best examples of horribly terrifying acting I've ever seen. It is so ridiculous, I found myself making up my own dialogue to the story, which I enjoyed better. If you want a good party game, rent the movie. If not, try \\"Underworld\\" instead.
B000002UAO|5.0|RUBBER SOUL remains a milestone in The Beatles' recording careers.  It ushered in their most celebrated and sophisticated musical phase that is unrivalled to this day.<br />In the 20 months since The Beatles landed in America to the time the band recorded this album, rock 'n' roll had undergone a revolution, sparked by The Beatles themselves.  The British invasion inspired Bob Dylan to go electric, while The Beatles converted the L.A. folk quartet, The Byrds, to replace their acoustic guitars with electric music.  Add to this the whiff of American grass and you get the influences which shaped the late-1965 Beatles.<br />Above all, the Beatle's songwriting takes a big leap forward with RUBBER SOUL.  For the first time John, Paul and George avoid the cliched boy-meets-girl songs and address introspective themes.  Though RUBBER SOUL was widely viewed as Just Another Beatles Album in late-1965, some listners took notice of the words with as much care as they did Dylan albums.  Some started to use the word &quot;poetry&quot; to describe Beatles music.<br />The album opens superbly with the funky Drive My Car which features a sharp vocal by Paul and a gorgeous bass influenced by Motown.  John's Norwegian Wood is one of the record's highlights and introduces the sitar to Western ears.  It obliquely tells of an affair John once had.  You Won't See Me could've easily been a single.  Paul's song, it is simply structured but strong.  Nowhere Man was actually pulled as a single in the U.S. and is the first Beatles song not to talk about love or girls.  John looks in the mirror and finds himself lost in a lyric that was one of his best (Dylan covered it many years later).  George's Think For Yourself also steers away from the love song and features Paul playing the distinctive fuzz bass.  The Word preceeds All You Need Is Love and discusses love not in boy-girl terms but universally (at a time when the Anti-War Movement was growing).  Michelle closes side 1 in style.  Love it orhate it, it is a fine love song with another great bass line.<br />Side 2 opens and closes with two disposable songs, What Goes On? and Run For Your Life.  RUBBER SOUL would have been far better with the double-sided single, We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper, taking their place.  However, the rest of side 2 shines with Girl and I'm Looking Through You -- John and Paul's complex views about women which are light-years away from She Loves You -- and In My Life which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation recently named as the best song of all time.  In My Life is a milestone in Lennon's career, featuring a nostalgic but bittersweet lyric.  Lennon has never been this candid with his audience.  Word is merely a leftover from the Help! sessions, though George's If I Needed Someone features the chiming Rickenbacker put to good use.<br />Today, RUBBER SOUL remains fresh.  Amazingly, it was rush-recorded in two weeks with most of the songs written in the studio.  John and Paul are at the height of their powers, while George is keeping pace with two songs instead of his customary one (or none).  The album's acoustic sound allow's the band's maturing lyrics to be heard, while the arrangements are simple, yet intelligent.  Few Beatles albums can rival RUBBER SOUL in  songwriting.  The sound of the album sounds unified which will pave the way for their next two albums, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper.  RUBBER SOUL is The Beatles' first masterpiece.
B000002LND|4.0|\\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is a must-have for any respectable pop culture fan. Madonna's best-selling album worldwide, it includes her biggest hits from 1983 to 1990, including \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Like a Virgin,\\" and \\"Vogue.\\" It also has some of my personal favorites, such as \\"Material Girl,\\" \\"Papa Don't Preach,\\" and \\"Like a Prayer.\\" Even though this album is 15 years old, it still has the power to make you want to shake your booty, like Britney did in \\"Crossroads\\" (not that I went to see it). Madonna is the epitome of pop culture; she's self-centered, oversexed, and a trend pimp. How can you not love her?
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code (1996.), the Pearl Jam's fourth studio album<br /><br />The Pearl Jam were one of the great bands to come out of the Seattle grunge movement but more importantly, they are one of the few bands, if not the only band to survive from the movement to this present day. By the time 1996 rolled around the grunge movement was practically over and musical trends had moved onto plenty of new and up and coming styles. As a result, the Pearl Jam, like all great bands, had to change their sound in order to remain a great musical force. They couldn't have done this much more perfectly than with 'No Code', their fourth studio album, which stands as perhaps their most experimental and diverse effort. For me, this album is the reason why the Pearl Jam have survived to the present day. Their diverse and changing, forever original style is definitely rooted in 'No Code'. This classic has paved the way for the Pearl Jam's post millenium work and has, in my opinion been an influence for many other bands.<br /><br />After a somewhat dip in standards with the grungy, off the wall, previous album, 'Vitalogy' (an excellent album but not on the levels of 'Ten' or 'Vs.' by a mile), 'No Code' is an amazing return to great form for the Pearl Jam. 'No Code' is definitely the Pearl Jam's most underrated record, it never gets the great attention it rightfully deserves. Not only that, it amazes me that only about 2-3 million copies of this have sold worldwide - if it was based on the music quality, it would sell 10 times that by now, however I'm confident this album will stand the test of time and will be hailed as a masterpiece by many in a decade or so time. 'No Code' has everything you could wish for in an album in terms of diversity. There's the classic heavy rockers still there, country styled tracks, hushed melodies in parts and some real original ideas. However, even with this variation, the record is remarkably consistent to listen to, its the kind of album you can listen to right through without the need to skip tracks (something that you have to do with its predecessor 'Vitalogy' in my opinion). In my opinion, Eddie Vedder gets more and more accomplished as a singer album by album and this is certainly true on 'No Code', he can still growl out the heavier songs but he sings the slower tracks better than he has ever done before on this album. The band are still the great, powerful force they were on 'Ten', the only difference to the band being that the Pearl Jam have a new drummer (yes, their 3rd one!), who was none other than ex-Red Hot Chilli Peppers drummer Jack Irons.<br /><br />The album has a really unusual start to it. Most rock bands will start an album with a heavy rocker, the Pearl Jam themeselves have done it on their first 3 albums, but 'No Code' begins with the quiet, thoughtful 'Sometimes'. People have criticised this as a low key start but I personally think its a great idea by the band to buck the album making trend. However don't let the opener catch you out, 'Hail Hail' is a blasting follow up, with a classic, roaring riff. 'Who You Are' sounds almost anthem like, with the guitars sounding the tune to Eddie Vedder's voice - its a great change of direction in sound. 'In My Tree' is a powerful follow up, the slow rolling start builds into a real rocking finish. 'Smile' is another experimental track, very much in the style of Neil Young and Crazy Horse (you can see the influence from Young, after all they recorded an album 'Mirror Ball' with him) and it is a highlight of the album. 'Off He Goes' is a slower, hushed track - Vedder sings this one with real emotion. 'Had It' is another heavy rocker and 'Red Mosquito' incorporates some versatile guitar play from Gossard and McCready. 'Lukin' is a very listenable one minute interlude track; Vedder shouts at the top of his voice. Then, though we have the follow up in 'Present Tense', the greatest track on the album for me, with amazingly deep and mellow guitar tones characterising it. 'Mankind' is sung by Stone Gossard and this one sounds very much like the stuff Green Day do in today's music world - its that influence factor again! 'I'm Open' is another experimental track, which has Eddie Vedder speaking over the top in an almost prophetic style. 'Around the Bend' is a classy, country styled track to round off the album.<br /><br />'No Code' is an immensely important part of the Pearl Jam's development as a band. Its a classic album full of experimental ideas that work extremely well. This record is unfairly underrated and deserves much more credit than it gets. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone familiar with the band as you'll almost certainly not be disappointed. I would advise new listeners to the band to get the grungy period stuff first (i.e. 'Ten' and 'Vs.') before experiencing this one - you can appreciate it much more that way.tone Gossard and this one sounds very much like the stuff Green Day do in today's music world - its that influence factor again!

B0007OCG4W|1.0|I was really excited about seeing this, since it got such good reviews. Boy, was I surprised. This movie is so depressing, with everyone cheating on each other and getting hurt. There was a review that said that this is a real love story, but if that's true we all might as well throw in the towel. If you like feeling like you want to slit your wrists, then watch the movie. If not, definitely look elsewhere.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Amnesiac (2001.), Radiohead's fifth studio album<br /><br />Radiohead over the years have captured the imagination of many a listener with their unique and often mind-boggling style of alternative rock. 'Amnesiac', Radiohead's fifth studio album, released in 2001 is, in very much simple terms, a continuation of the experimental 'Kid A', which they had released a year earlier. Since the groundbreaking popularity and critical acclaim of their 1997 masterpiece, 'OK Computer', Radiohead took steps to completely change their style and 'Amnesiac' is a fine example of this phase of the bands career, where they produced music which echoed the band's own dislike of the great popularity and acclaim which they gained from their earlier releases.<br /><br />'Amnesiac', I'll put it simply, is quite a complex ultra-layered record which you have to put an awful lot of effort in yourself to get into as it has a very intraverted and off-the-wall style (more so in my opinion than 'Kid A'). 'Amnesiac' has often unfairly been given the tag of being 'Kid B' by those who believe this is the rejects from the 'Kid A' recording sessions in 2000. I think this is quite harsh on the album - I think that Radiohead have actually separated the music from the 2000 creative batch quite well into the two albums. The stuff on 'Amnesiac' is quite different to that on 'Kid A', remember that Radiohead are not a band that puts out the same album twice.<br /><br />The tracks on the album have quite a big keyboard and effects presence and again, like on 'Kid A', the guitar usage is very much stripped down. In many ways, 'Amnesiac' is an album which focuses the listener on the human senses and the song titles (such as Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors) can almost be sensed in the music on the tracks, its pretty ingenious. Certainly, the more you listen to this work, the more this becomes apparant. Similarly, Thom Yorke's vocals play a major part in creating these effects with the tracks as his lacklustre style conveys the often cynical and sarcastic nature of Radiohead's lyrics, especially on this album. Overall, you can't fault Radiohead's creative genius on this album but I think the complexity of some of their tracks can just be a little too much at times and I think they in parts sacrifice too much listenability for complex, difficult ideas.<br /><br />'Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box' is an interesting opener (the title tells you that alone!) but it is very clever, especially with the metallic sound that you hear at the start before it blends into a rather mellow keyboard orientated track. 'Pyramid Song' is a highlight of the album, very atmospheric with Yorke's humming style with the piano style in the background. The lyrics aren't pleasant but that's part of the songs style - there's some good drumming from Phil Selway later on in the track. 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors' is another conceptual track and a very good one, with a computerised voice speaking over sounds which sound ... well ... 'revolutionary!' 'You and whose army' is a hollow, harmonised track with some dead-pan singing from Thom Yorke but it builds to a good climax at the end. 'I Might be Wrong' has a spacey start but this soon becomes a guitar based track with a great riff alongside some wailing vocals from Thom Yorke. 'Knives Out' is another very much classic Radiohead sounding track with more nifty guitar play. 'Morning Bell/Amnesiac' though is basically another version of the track on 'Kid A' and it doesn't really seem that necessary. Next up is 'Dollars and Cents', a kind of haunting track with loads of dissonance. 'Hunting Bears' is a good 2 minute interval which is basically guitar play with a few 'yelping' effects. 'Like Spinning Plates' is a pretty odd starting track but the effects the song creates is like what the song title says. 'Life in a Glasshouse' is almost like a song you'd hear at a theatre, with a jazz band background, a very interesting finisher.<br /><br />In my opinion, 'Amnesiac' is a continuation of Radiohead's experimental post-millenia style and it works very well, even if it is a little over-complex in parts. I personally think it doesn't hold a candle to previous works like 'The Bends' but it is a multi-dimensional album which is bound to get you thinking when you listen to it. I'd definitely recommend it for any fan of Radiohead but not for a new listener.perimental post-millenia style and it works very well, even if it is a little over-complex in parts.

B00009V7P8|5.0|i love every single song on this CD. i have been in love with this CD since the first time i heard it. the songs are so beautifully filled with emotion that they had me in tears (that is a very hard thing to do considering that i didn't even cry when my grandma died). my friend and i have listened to O 1,000 times and each time it is still as beautiful as it was the first time.
1400032717|4.0|The book was very interesting. It made you want to keep reading. I read and moticed that it cussed a lot. When Christopher tells the story he enters everything into the book. Cussing and all. I had to do it for a school report, and thankfully my teacher hadn't read the book yet. :P I encourage you to read the book if you think that your life suxs. I know that it's fiction, but it seems real.
0767817486|3.0|Brad Davis in his best, and most famous, role as Billy Hayes...a young American trapped in the Turkish prison system.  His beautiful, sensitive performance in an arguably (un)sympathetic role and Guber's understated direction combine to make this standard prison-break drama an above average and suspenseful two hours.<br /><br />Interesting to see again in the context of 21st Century political climate/correctness, global relations and drug culture.  Too bad the 20th Anniversary DVD edition didn't rise to the occasion and include at least a scholarly or insightful commentary track...but they played it safe and played it cheap by slapping together this \\"special edition\\" which offers NOTHING special other than the fine performances and compelling story of the original film.  Oh, yeah...and the disk had some glitches, too.<br /><br />I recommend the movie to see again, but this DVD is not worth purchasing even at the discount price.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|1 star is generous..save your money.......this genere   of film does need a certain atmosphere but van helsing is so dark that 90 per cent of the film is un-viewwable.....acting?.frankenstein was ok.
B00097DX3U|5.0|What a great followup album with lots of interesting sounds and lyrics.  I have always been a Chris Cornell fan, I actually still listen to his Euphoria Morning album which i still find awesome, and his unique talent is no different on this album.  Of course Morello's guitar is one-of-a-kind and makes plenty of contributions also.  The group sounds like they found their musical style, and although thier debut was incredible, i think this one should receive the same attention.  You won't be dissapointed!
B00004YX39|2.0|This album is a test for Steely Dan fans because there are not many, if any, good songs on Gaucho.  I liked \\"Third World Man\\" when I first heard it and \\"Hey Nineteen\\" is kind of likeable, even if the lyrics are really goofy.  Steely Dan's songs can be goofy at times but usually the instrumentation carries the music more than the lyrics do.  Somehow, \\"Hey Nineteen\\" comes across this way, with lyrics like, \\"Way back when in '67, I was a dandy of Gamma Chi.\\"  \\"Sweet things from Boston, so young and reelin'.\\" \\"Move down to Scarsdale, where the hell am I?\\"  Somehow, the rest of the songs just don't come across as inspiring, intriguing, interesting, or even relaxing to me.  In fact, some of the songs on here are a bit depressing because the songs have the potential to be stimulating in a good way. Somehow, the mechanical feel of the records just ruins the enjoyment of the songs altogether.  I've read a couple of reviews of this CD that say the record is \\"overly studied,\\" or \\"excessively precise and polished.\\"  I think those reviews somehow capture the energy of this record in a true way.  However, if you are able to like even just one song on \\"gaucho,\\" then it's safe to say you are a Steely Dan fan.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was recommended this album from numerous peers with similar music taste, and seeing as they've not led me wrong yet, I'd figure I check this band out.<br /><br />What I got was my pick for the best album of 2004. A jaunty, uplifting poppy album, the songs really vary in tone, but overall they're all great songs. While some songs (Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels), Rebellion (Lies), and In the Backseat) have the edge over some (Une Anee Sans Lumiere, Haiti), this album is a masterwork of what music these days should be, rather than cheap MTV targeted pop garbage. This album moves me every time I hear it, and I strongly recommend it if you like alternative or pop alike.
B0007GAERG|5.0|After 15 years, Mariah is still the BEST Pop/R&B female in the industry. There are many copies and imitations out there, but Mariah is the original. The one and only. No need to compare her to the other Pop/R&B divas because there's no contest. Mariah's talent looms large over her competitors. You don't get to be Mariah Carey by being average. She's the best and everyone knows it. And now she's making her own history by making a GREAT album and proving everybody else wrong. If you're a true Mariah fan and you don't have this album, then you're really missing out.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|It's Time is a celebration of musical magic! Michael Buble is a refreshing and welcome addition to the music scene. Celebrate how he manages to make every song on this cd his own and he accomplishes it with style and panache. <br /> <br />Since my purchase of It's Time it has been in steady rotation both in my car stereo and in the offices and will continue playing for a long long time. There is something on this album for all moods and it's refreshing to enjoy EVERY track on a cd for a change. Thank you Mr. Buble.
0575074361|4.0|I was eagerly anticipating Alastair Reynolds first full length novel outside of the Revelation Space universe.  In Century Rain he creates a pastiche of hard science fiction and alternate history noir thriller with some horror elements thrown in as well.  Surprisingly, it was the non-science fiction elements of the story that appealed to me the most.  The shadowy atmosphere of E2 was more intriguing than the high tech battlefield of the real solar system.   <br />The main failure of the novel was that it devolved into an extended chase scene and in the process jettisoned much in the way of plot and character development.  Despite this fact, I still enjoyed reading Century Rain.  Reynolds' writes well and is adept at integrating cutting edge physics without bogging down the storyline.  Ultimately, the conclusion I came to while a good way through the book was that for better or worse it would make a pretty good movie.
B0007P3582|1.0|come on people...look at the album cover, its a hood-rich version of the HULK...50 obviously gave in to the demands of the mainstream and is lovin it, as hes pleasin plenty of 40 year old real-estater's (alongwith their wives), and clueless 13 year old's who claim 50 is a lyrical genious....be real people.  <br />-rbsambo
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests and then some.  Keanu's acting is so bad in this film that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance.  Rachel Weisz does give a great and lively performance but she's the only actor in the film who bothers to give one while the rest of the actors camp it up to the point of nausea (with the exception of Peter Stormare, who was great as the devil) The direction is a joke and lacks coherency plus the screenplay does not handle the subject very well at all with dialog that is horrendous and story structure that literally makes no sense. <br /> <br />Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stormare for at least doing their best with what was handed to them but the movie itself was horrible.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002F7I9Y|2.0|I have been an avid fan of Ray's for over 45 years and this is my least favorite album.  Some of the duets are unlistenable.  I archived 4 tracks to a mix CD and tossed this thing somewhere -- I don't know where or care.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This guy defines GEEK! Look at this guy. This is the type of guy you can save your lunch money off of. I wish this guy went to my high school. I would kick him around everyday. HAHAHA. This movie was ok. It wasn't better than FDTV, but it is funny as heck. I can watch this movie over and over. I would recommend this with FDTV.
B0002OERI0|1.0|First off this is not punk, this is pop with instruments. I am 14 and everybody in my school has this d*mm cd and I can't stand it. Green Day Have never been good. I bought a copy of Dookie last year and ended up giving it to GoodWill. All this is is overplayed garbage with a political statement that there shoving down our throats If i want to hear politics I'll turn on CSPAN not put in a record. If you want punk try The Clash, Ramones, Sex Pistols, Velvet Underground, or anything else. But please dont buy this album and let them make another one.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Team America reinforces the idea that sometimes simple is just better. Trey Parker and his associates show \\"South Park\\" showed that a piece of colored construction paper cutouts could turn into the lovable character named \\"Cartman\\". I love the simple stuff. I'm tired of all these big budget movies and then I leave the theatre and it wasn't even good. Lets take things back to the basics. I like this movie. What I like most about it is that its \\"cheezy\\". I love cheezy movies. These hollywood guys think that you need to spend 50 million to make a good movie. I think thats crap. Look at movies like \\"Team America, \\"FDTV\\" and \\"South Park\\". These show you that it doesn't take a big budget to make timeless classics. I love this kinda stuff!
B00082IJ08|5.0|This album was everything I expected and more. It seemlessly blends a unique mix of instrumentals with rap (sometimes unexpected but always fitting). A great addition to any music collection.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|The same pieces are there and even the plot makes a little bit more sense than the plot in the original Bourne movie, but somehow it fails to click.
B000002H4Q|4.0|While certainly not as good as \\"Disintegration\\" (the band's next album), nonetheless \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" stands out as an adventurous album on which the listener never knows what to expect next.  In that regard, it's alot of fun to listen to.  The most recognizable track \\"Just Like Heaven,\\" is one of those songs that bars play to keep people inside (like \\"American Pie\\" or \\"Baba O'Reilly\\").  If you really think about it, the song is a similar but slightly improved version of \\"In Between Days,\\" the opening track of \\"Head on the Door.\\"  At first one might think it's a straight forward song about romance, but the last stanza seems to suggest that poor Robert Smith is just fantasizing.  (Fans of this song might be interested in hearing \\"All the Way\\" off of New Order's album \\"Technique\\" which basically sound like a carbon copy of \\"Just Like Heaven\\").    \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" tells a compelling story about Robert and his companion being approached by a gypsy man and his two children.  While Robert feels guilty about all of his possessions, he is profoundly saddened and disappointed when his companion says \\"I hate these people staring, make them go away from me.\\"  Ouch!    Other favorites of mine on the album include \\"Icing Sugar\\" and \\"Shiver and Shake.\\"  Each song stands alone in its own little world, and perfectly creates the atmosphere of Smith's lyrics.    It is interesting to note that on the previous album \\"Head on the Door,\\" Smith takes sole credit for both music and lyrics; here, all the band members are credited for the music.  Also, in my opinion, instrumentally, \\"Kiss Me\\" and \\"Disintegration\\" represent the band at its peak.
B00023B1LC|3.0|If you think about the content of this thing you will be appalled by its absurdity, but it does not matter at all, you can simply enjoy the smooth action.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Behemoth face a dilemma as a Polish death metal act. Now that they have forgone most of their black metal roots, they will now forever be compared with another state-of-the-art Polish death metal group - the mighty Decapitated; of course Decapitated are reguarly compared to seminal Polish deathsters Vader.  <br />  <br />Decapitated raised the death metal bar significantly on their last two releases 2002's  Nihility and 2004's The Negation. Behemoth were always going to face an uphill battle, like it or not, to at least come close to the brilliance of their country mates. Did they? Straight answer - Yes. Behemoth have not only lived-up to the standards set by Decapitated, they have outdone anything produced by another band they have recently been compated to heavily - the mighty Nile...and that is definately saying something. <br />  <br />Demigod is a crushing album from start to finish, the brutal 'Sculpting The Throne of Seth' erupts out of the speakers at maximum velocity and by the time you reach track 4, the savage 'Nephilim Rising' the listener is aware they are not listening to just another faceless death metal act riding the corpses of Deicide and Morbid Angel. <br />  <br />While it is undoubledly the music that takes centre stage on Demigod, you cannot overlook the brilliant effort the band has displayed in the album's presentation. Lead vocalist and lyricist Nergal explains each song brilliantly and sheds a fascinating light on his personal beliefs in the process. <br />  <br />Demigod is a first-class slab of brutal modern death metal. In a musical climate where death metal is beginning to be associated with keyboards and clean vocals, Behemoth are keeping the true essence of this once dangerous genre well and truly alive, without sacrificing progression. That is without a doubt an achievement few can lay claim to. <br />  <br />
B000002L7R|3.0|This album found Prince dabling in psychedelia (especially on the absolutely wonderful 'Paisley Park').  Not that this is a psychadelic album really, but it does mark a slight foray into an area in which Prince had not yet traveled up to this point.  The first two tracks are great.  In addition to the standard psychadelic trippy-ness, both the title track and 'Paisley Park' are filled with the type of optimism and idealism that largely characterized the psychedelic movement, and even more so, its companion hippie counter-culture.  Yet there is a touch of somberness to both of these songs.  There is a general somberness to this entire album actually.  This is in direct contrast to his previous two masterstrokes.  Both \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain\\" were intense passionate affairs with off the charts kenetic energy.  This album has its lively moments such as the stripped down funk jam 'Tamborine' and the dense multi-layered funk jam 'America', but this album generally finds Prince being more somber than we were used to seeing him up until this point (the most obvious exception is the huge hit 'Raspberry Beret' which is one of the greatest pop songs that anyone has ever made).  He is especially contemplative on the utterly beautiful 'Condition of the Heart' which is a great song once it finally decides to get started after 1:45 seconds into the song.  The other hit 'Pop Life' is yet another impeccably constructed funky & flawless pop song from Prince.  It seems that Prince could pump this kind of stuff out in his sleep at this time.  You're probably familiar with the two big hits off of this album, but please don't buy this album thinking that anything else on here sounds anything like those two songs because it doesn't.  My other personal favorite on here is the soulful half sung, half spoken-word 'The Ladder'.  'Temptation' is a *really* raucus track, and the unbridled and unmannered libido-driven intensity is a pretty sharp departure from most of the rest of the album.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this as an introduction to Prince, but if you already own all of his other albums from \\"Dirty Mind\\" to \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\", then this should make for a pretty solid addition to your collection.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I just finished watching season 3 and now I'll have to wait for season 4. First of all, I was a little startled with the skimppy packaging. What happen? I guess they just want to cut cost?<BR>Anyway,back to my review. I love this season as the previous. I still can't believe they haven't added a commentary or some sort for some episodes like some other movies or series. I'm a little bit disappointed. <BR>A nice bonus/extras on the actors comments on their childhood,short but cute.<BR>I like the part where Kirk shows some dance moves.<BR>One addition I like to see in the future's dvds besides the commentary from the actors and director is adding the Stars Hollow map where the viewer can have a virtual visit to this beloved town.<BR>I love Gilmore Girls and I know when the 4th season comes out,I'll be first in line to get them.

0316172324|5.0|I really liked this book.  Read the whole thing at a bookstore.  Fascinating look at how we humans make up our minds much quicker and with much less data than we think we do.  I believe Gladwell is bringing us closer to the truth about how humans really make decision.
0425098478|1.0|The authors try to dress up common sense in a \\"parable\\" that will make anyone with any sense of the literary cringe.  Don't waste your time on this unless you want to study how not to write a book.   The writing is awful and the attempts to illustrate what they consider to be deep nuggets of wisdom are laughable.  The book is corny in the sense of \\"gee-golly-whiz Mr. Manager, duh, why didn't I see that.  Boy oh boy, by gompers, you're so wise and I want to be just like you!\\"  Book summary: If you want to be effective at work, use common sense, be honest but fair in your praises and criticisms, and master some basic social skills.  Really?  Wow!  That's deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|When I picked up this cd, I never heard it before. I only bought it because of the huge hype and critical acclaim about it. I put it into my discman and played it.     At first I thought it was ok...reminded me of The Talking Heads a lil. Through repeated listens, I grew to love this cd. Over more listens of the cd, and with a read through over the lyrics, I fell in love with it.  Haunting vocals, inceredible lyrics, what else could you want in a cd.     Highlights include the amazing Neighboord #1 (Tunnels), The fantasic Une Annee Sans Lumiere, and the Wonderfully Haunting and Brillintly Produced Wake up, which happens to rock your soul out but tug at your heart strings. Wake Up is perhaps one of the best recorded songs of teh past 10 years. When you hear the lead singer sing the lyrics \\"If the children dont grow up, our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up. We're just a million little god's causin' rain storms turnin' every good thing to rust, I guess we'll just have to adjust\\", your eyes fill with tears. Its just so haunting and beautiful. Thats how the rest of the cd is.      If your a fan of the Talking Heads, or Roxy Music, buy this. You wont regret it...Promise.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom discovers that his old college professor, Morrie Schwartz, is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease.  Mitch begins to visits Morrie every Tuesday, and they discuss issues such as death, the meaning of live, family, etc.      I do agree with the reviewers who have said that there were no big revelations in this book.  The final lessons Morrie taught to Mitch were common sense and things that most people either figure out on their own or have been told numerous times by other 'teachers' in their life (be it an actual teacher, a parent, a friend, etc).  Live life to the fullest, realize that the most important things in life have nothing to do with money, don't get so busy getting ahead that you forget what really matters, don't fail to take time to enjoy what really matters, etc, etc.      However, even if you *know* these things, often you still need to be reminded of them.  This book does a wonderful job of reminding!  It's a very powerful book, and I highly recommend it to people of all ages.
1400032717|5.0|Reading this book, I could identify with Christopher, and the writing and story is amazing. I could not put it down. Definite RECOMMEND!
0062502182|5.0|This book is so out of the reality in which we live in... I think that's what makes it so inspiring and beautiful. For people who like adventure, and seach for dreams come true, this is a great example of how life can become \\"a box of chocolates\\"... Loved it.
B00097DX3U|1.0|Crap! Everything about this new effort is crap. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on \\"Your time has come\\" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are trite, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album. Perhaps they should've stayed in exile awhile longer.
0060589272|4.0|I think this is a transition in Coelho's writing. It is the most realistic and adventurous of all his novels. Through it you can almost feel like you're wachting a movie. Loved the end...
B0002IU988|5.0|After Creed split I did not know what to think. I was glad I would not be hearing from \\"bleeding your ears\\" voice of Scott Stapp, but I was sad that the band had split. Now with Myles Kennedy, formerly of Mayfield Four, at the vocals, and the rest of Creed, minus Stapp, emerges Alter Bridge: the best new rock band out there and nothing like Creed. <br /> <br />This is the CD where Mark Tremonti lets loose and shows his potential which he did not seem to be able to demonstrate because of Stapp's controlling attitude. His guitar riffs are excellent and his solos are majestic; he is emerging as one of the best guitarists in today's rock. <br /> <br />Aside from a new name, Alter Bridge is a completely different band beacause of new Lead Singer Myles Kennedy. His vocal range is exceptionnal on this record and his voice and power fit Alter Bridge to perfection. His voice is similiar to that of Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. But the difference with Creed is very visible and it shows how one person can change the face of a band; at least with Kennedy you can understand what he's saying, not like Stapp where you needed a supercomputer to decipher the word coming out of his mouth. <br /> <br />Now, as for the CD, it's almost perfect. It evokes such emotion, such passion and strength, you will get hooked and will not be able to stop listening to it. For everyone, the band's songs and name will have a different significance, but for me, this record is about Life, humanity, finding yourself and facing the end of days, may that be personal (death) or collective (end of the world, not in a biblical manner). The band's name Alter Bridge is another fascinating name evoking a passage to somewhere new, a connection between two worlds, whether they be past or future, death and life, or a passage between an old and a new different world. The record is full of spiritual meaning, not in a religious way, but more in a way that attaches itself to human condition. Don't believe the tag \\"christian rock\\" that is sometimes put on the band; that is what may be said about Creed, but without Scott Stapp, this is a great new hard rock band.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are just phenomenal on this CD, they are the best that I've heard so far, or in a long long time; Tremonti should continue to write this kind of music. <br /> <br />Now for the songs: Open  Your Eyes, Metalingus, Broken Wings, In Loving Memory, Down To My Last and Shed my Skin are all 10/10 songs, they are perfection in every sense of the word. The solo and emotion on Open your eyes, the sheer perfection of Metalingus, the lyrics in Shed my Skin and Broken Wings, the soft ballad In Loving Memory and the passion in Down To My &#319;ast : WOW!!!! <br /> <br />Now for the others they are also great songs : One Day Remains, The End is here are 9/10, Find the real is 8/10, and Burn it down is 6/10, by far the weakest song on this album. <br /> <br />The songs are pure energy produced by one of the best bands that we have in the music industry today. GET THE CD, LISTEN TO IT, LOVE IT. You Will NOT REGRET. This is worth your money and time, simply absolutely incredible, believe me.
B0002O0CM0|5.0|This CD really gives the other voices in the band (Ray Manzarek and Robbie Krieger) the chance to shine. Although Jim Morrison fans will not be too fond of it, Ray fans will. His voice and keyboard skills in Ships with Sails and Wandering Musician are something to be noted for. Suprisingly, Tightrope Ride was written and demoed when Morrison was still alive. And Get Up and Dance will have you up and about, clapping and singing with Ray and the girls in the back. Manzarek also writes a song called the Peking King and the New York Queen which is a tale with a creativity that matches that of Jim Morrison. What about Robbie? He  sings catchy songs like I'm Horny,I'm Stoned and Variety is the Spice of Life, which puts him in tale of him cheating on his wife. I'm Horny, I'm Stoned portrays him in time that we've all been in at least once in our life, lonely and bored. But Ray sings quite a diverse selection of songs with like that of Verdilac, which is a voo-doo shaman funky type thing and going to that of Hardwood Floor, which is a song of a young couple who are in desperate need of money but happy with their love. It has Robbie multi-tasking, playing harmonica and guitar at the same time (like that guy on the DQ commercial). <br />     All in all, if you're a Jim Morrison fan, do not expect to be looking for any trace of the old Doors in here, you won't find it. But if you're more interested in the rest of the band or just love the Doors, get it for your collection.

0385336810|2.0|I was five hours from home and bored, so I decided to stop by the local libery, get a card and check out a book. I wanted something light and fuzzy, so I could get through it quickly and take a break from some of the heavier stuff I have been reading. I was oringally looking for one of the author's Shopacholic books, but only found this one. I was oddly disappointed, though I don't know why. I wanted a light read and that's what I got. <br /> <br />Emma Corrigan is a hapless British woman, struggling to hold onto her job. Blowing what she believes to be her one chance at a promotion, she boards an airplane already depressed. Scary turbulence causes Emma to spill all her secrets to the man seated next to her. Going to work the next day, Emma finds out that the man next to her is the CEO of her company. What follows is a series of wacky but predicat able high jicks.  <br /> <br />The book is best described as a Julia Roberts movie, sweet, but there is nothing different to set it apart from other chick lite and it is forgetable. There was knowing new here at all. I shouldn't complain, because I wanted fluff. I just thought I would get fluff with a little more substance.
B00097DX3U|2.0|Im all for bands changing their style but honestly this kinda detracts from the audioslave people came to know. <br /> <br />at least for me this album puts me to sleep with those slow soul or bluesy songs. But then it kicks back with some awesome guitars and vocals on songs like Number One Zero....even the lead single is another take on Like A Stone. <br /> <br />sometims they sound like Guns n Roses pulling the blues thing (The Curse) and other times they sound like STP (The Worm). The only song that stood out for me is YESTERDAY TO TOMORROW. Simply because of the emotion and guitars incorporated. <br /> <br />I suppose they want to break from any comparisons to their previous bands and im all for bands changing their style and with this they lose or win new fans. However this album is not as energetic as their debut. At times it felt i was in a gospel choir. Tnis one suffers the sophomore curse. As boring as the picture on the cover.
0316666343|3.0|On the way home from school, Susie Salmon (like the fish) is raped and murder by her next door neighbor. She enters heaven, a place where all her desires are granted and she looks down and watches her family and friends move on. Her father is unable to admit that she is dead and gone. Her mother moves on too quickly and can't stand to be around anything that reminds her of Susie. Sister Lindsey is hunted by her sister's death, known as the dead girl's sister at her school. She struggles to come out from underneath it all, while brother Buckley struggles to understand that his sister is gone and later, who she was. Grandma arrives to put the family together, before taking over as the mother. There is also the boy that could have been for Susie, the one who gave her her first kiss. On her way to heaven, Susie touched a girl name Ruth and changed her. Ruth now spends her days searching for the dead. There are other various characters as well, some who knew Susie well and some who were just in passing. <br /> <br />This is my second reading of The Lovely Bones. On the first reading, I was enchanted by it. Sebold has a poetic way of writing things. However, upon the second reading, I believed I just gave myself into the hype. Her writing is still lyrical, but the plot is a bit silly. It starts off well, with each family member and friend dealing with the first year of the murder. But in the middle, it starts to lose it's way. The ending with Susie and Ray is a bit riduculus. It also seems as if the rules of heaven change half way through. The dead can not interact with the living, but Susie does several times. Too much time is spend on uninteresting characters such as the dad and the mother and not enough on minor characters such as the grandmother or Ruth. If the mother was a man, there would be no redemption for her actions. This book doesn't stand up to a second, unbaised reading.
B00066N8JS|5.0|A masterpiece of sound and one of the most popular and praised albums of the mid-90s, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" has aged well.  Trent Reznor has crafted an album that successfully fuses the sounds he experimented with in the past, the pop/industrial and dark balladry of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", the sexual tension of his covers of \\"Get Down Make Love\\" and \\"Physical\\", the angry blast of \\"Broken\\", even the overproduction of the remixes, all come together on this album, with a healthy dose of Berlin-era David Bowie thrown into the mix.  But the strength is in the lyrics-- themes of alienation, pain, self-deprecation, but with a universal feel to it-- everyone has felt this way, maybe not to these extremes, but they have. <br /> <br />Opening with a salvo of anger and rage (\\"Mr Self Destruct\\"), \\"The Downward Spiral\\" at first sounds like the logical successor to \\"Broken\\", but there's something else, an odd, textured bridge and an undercurrent of sexual tension that informs itself throughout that song and the rest of the record-- from the funky rhythms of \\"Piggy\\" to the chorus \\"March of the Pigs\\" to the overtness of \\"Reptile\\".  The sexuality of the record comes to a head (clearly) with \\"Closer\\" before becoming mixed with pain and despair-- effective on such cuts as \\"The Becoming\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" before culminating in \\"Hurt\\", an expression of anguish and loss.  The strength on the record lies not with the clever construction or the impressive musical arrangements, but with Reznor's vocal, infused with all the intent of the music and way up in the forefront, framed and supported well by the song arrangements. <br /> <br />The real point is, start to finish, the record is superb, and it works as a whole.  The deluxe edition remasters the record, remarkably improving the sound drastically enough to make it worthwhile and adds a disc of \\"remixes, b-sides, demos, and non-album tracks.  <br /> <br />While its probably of minimal value to a long-time fan, the material certainly augments the album nicely and really does collect most of the best material from the era (mind you, I would have made some changes, but I think anyone can argue that).  Selected for inclusion are two songs featured on soundtracks (the slab of rage \\"Burn\\" from \\"Natural Born Killers\\" and a cover of Joy Division's \\"Dead Souls\\", which if you like you should check out Joy Division), two tracks from the \\"March of the Pigs\\" single (the extended MotP remix \\"All the Pigs, All Lined Up\\", similar to Reznor's live performances and the brief and stunning instrumental loop \\"A Violet Fluid\\"), three tracks from the \\"Closer\\" single (the intriguing precursor remix that adds depth and mystery to the piece in place of its funkiness, \\"Closer to God\\", agressive retake on the track, and a fantastic dark and haunting cover of Soft Cell's \\"Memorabilia\\"), three tracks from the remix album \\"Further Down the Spiral\\" (the fantastic Rick Ruben remix of \\"Piggy\\" featuring fantastic guitar by Dave Navarro, a great, bleak remix of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" by Coil/Danny Hyde that is vastly superior to the original and the single edit/remix of \\"Hurt\\"), and three demos from the era.  The demos are all very interesting, but of limited value-- typically the only real difference is in inferior vocal delivery. <br /> <br />In the day of endless remasters, repackagings, reissues, its great to see one thats worthwhile-- this one gets it right.  Highly recommended.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent Reznor never fails to surprise me with his delicate touches of instrumental fervor, stylistic maneuverability, and pure originality.  Pretty Hate Machine broke the ice with hits such as \\"Head Like  Hole\\" and made it possible for NIN precursors like Skinny Puppy to reach a greater following.  The Downward Spiral was a masterpiece that I still listen to even today.  Hands down, finding that place where metal meets Depeche Mode synth and taking it further yet.  And... The Fragile.  An overladen album, very ambitiously portrayed and magnificient in its own right, but heavily lauded by critics as a sellout.    <br /> <br />Reznor left the scene for awhile, scoring video game soundtracks and such, and has returned with the much-awaited With Teeth.   <br /> <br />It's got bite, but it's got beauty too.  Below-the-belt rockers like \\"You Know What You Are\\" and \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" are balanced out by more nuanced material: the hypnotic \\"All the Love in the World\\" and the piano ballad \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\"   <br /> <br />While the first half of the album is a characteristic NIN cruncher, with each song structured around a pounding drum sample, the magic really begins with the title track, and lasts the entire album.   <br /> <br />Yet within this format, the production shines the most.  Reznor has destroyed the banality of that cold, studio perfection that screams Pro-Tools, and replaced it with a live band.  This, above all, is the greatest marvel of \\"With Teeth,\\" it is the first NIN effort to sound like a live band instead of a layered one-man approach.  Drummer Dave Grohl's contributions to the album are excellent, and he has already been termed this generation's Jon Bonham.   <br /> <br />Truly worth a listen and shows that Reznor is worthy even in another decade at the age of 40.   <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|I first learned about Keane when I saw their CD in a music store for less than ten dollars.  I'd seen one of their videos on VH-1 and decided to buy the CD.  What the heck, right?  Keane has become one of my FAVORITE bands, and I've seen them in concert twice since then. <br /> <br />This album is a collection of brilliantly simple piano/synth-based songs with soaring, unforgettable melodies that you will find yourself singing all throughout the day.  Every song on the album is amazing - there are no filler tracks or bad cuts.  Everything sounds great, and the music will get your blood pumping and your voice singing before you know it. <br /> <br />I can't say enough great things about this band or this album.  It's a work of art, and you will not regret buying it for a second, especially at this price.  Get in while Keane is still relatively unknown, so two years from now you can say, \\"Oh, yeah.  I knew about Keane years ago when their first album came out.  You're just now hearing about them?  Where HAVE you been?\\"  :-)
B00097DX3U|5.0|Like a monster out of the gates, Audioslave has finally come crashing back into the music world with their much-awaited sophomore album.   <br />  <br />They have returned to prove yet again that the sum is, impossibly so, greater than its parts.  The supergroup enjoyed a self-titled debut in 2003 that skyrocketed up the charts with radio favorites \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Like a Stone,\\" and \\"Show Me How to Live,\\" though by the end of that summer, nearly the entire album had been played out on rock radio stations.   <br />  <br />Ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell has returned at the helm, bringing his original lineup of guitar wizard Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and Tim Commerford, all formerly of Rage Against the Machine.  And the effort here is much more solidified, the group identity has been realized to a much fuller extent.  While 2003's self titled was an immensely successful effort, and a hard rocker in its own right, it had points of sounding like what it really was at the time, Soundgarden singing over Rage Against the Machine instrumentals.    <br />  <br />After a year on the road, the supergroup seems to have cast off the chains of their former groups, and Audioslave is now an entity of its own stylistic ventures.  Upon first listen, Rubin's production has brought the group together to create a wall of harmonic hard-rock sound, of group energy and unity.  And as Cornell's vocals have ventured beyond the croon-scream song structures of the debut album, Tom Morello's chops have worked to weld themselves more deeply to the musical foundations of Audioslave.   <br />  <br />It is in this sense that we see an expansion of range, and upon second and third listens it is apparent that the sound has become more heavily blues-tinged, while still hanging on to the hard edge and whammy solos that popularized the first album.  Cornell steps forward even more as a modern day Robert Plant, playing off Morello's Robert Plant, and the result is dynamic.  Wilk and Commerford, equally,have become a truly muscular rhythm section. <br />  <br />The first single, \\"Be Yourself,\\" has garnered much criticism on fan forums and sites for being too \\"formulaic\\" in the vein of the previous hit \\"Like a Stone.\\"  While it is true that the skeletal aspects of this work, with the hypnotic rhythm section and mystical guitar leads mirroring Cornell's tenor crooning, reflect that particular hit, it is an original in its own right.  Within the context of \\"Out of Exile\\" the song thrives wonderfully, nestled between two great rockers.   <br /> <br />Hard rock ballads like \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" and \\"Heaven's Dead\\" would bring a solemn tear to the eye of any GNR or Zeppelin fan, and yet the songs contain so much more modernity that one could never consider this work dated.  Fringe rockers like \\"The Worm\\" and \\"Man and Animal\\" are remniscent of recent supergroup Velvet Revolver in their fearless melding of punk and metal with sheer pop sensiblity.   <br />  <br />This album is truly a recommendation for anyone, pop music and metal fan alike.  It contains just the right balance of hard rock, shredding, and ear-candy vocals to satisfy even the most critical of tastes.   <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|ok this is kinda long so stay with me. i probably sound harsh on some of the songs.. and morello is still a guitar god to me. i think im just so used to the 1st cd that this was a surprise. i love soundgarden a lot and some songs sound like that.. more sound like chris cornells euphoria morning though.. mixed with a guitar break/solo from rage - kinda ackward but they are better blended this time around. so go buy this cd :)  <br /> <br />Your Time Has Come: looked at the lyrics a lot, good song - has meaning. the guitar intro in beginning is awesome. the little solo break actually goes with the song *gasps*. 8/10 <br /> <br />Out Of Exile:  this song is pretty good if you dont look at the lyrics.. maybe it has other meaning rather then the religous meaning im getting from it - still pretty catchy.. not much of a guitar solo - but there is one kinda.. drum beat is kinda weird but eh. 7/10 <br /> <br />Be Youself: didnt like it at first- struggled with it for weeks.. its positive sounding at first.. but i have turned it into a sarcastic positive meaning so its an awesome song! the guitar solo does fit here.. somewhat. 9/10 <br /> <br />Doesn't Remind Me: seemingly random lyrics work for this song.. kinda of blues-ish beat going on - i fought the law (and the law won) keeps popping into my head but oh well. couldve done w/o the guitar solo. 9/10 <br /> <br />Drown Me Slowly: guitar solo umm.. destroyed this song. the ending is alright though. 6/10 <br /> <br />Heaven's Dead: cheesy lyrics.. heaven's dead when your sad.. umm ok yeah. this song sounds like it should be on Euphoria Morning. 4/10 <br /> <br />The Worm: really cool song. vocal stuff sounds like something.. but i cant place it. i dont quite understand the lyrics - but im working on it. guitar solo is umm.. overdone.. but it almost goes with the song - congrats morello for coming this (---) close to ruining another song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Man or Animal: oh.. ok. well this song sounds like the worm. guitar isackward here.. not sure what he is trying to prove with the sounds - it would of worked on a rage cd probably. 8/10 <br /> <br />Yesterday to Tomorrow: this song is my favorite. YAY. the guitar solo actually saved the song. the music is the best here - everyone does an awesome job. pretty slow - but its way good. ignore the lyrics for the most part and listen to the band. 10/10 <br /> <br />Dandelion: ok i almost threw up after listening to the opening verse - never got through this one.. i dont want to even try to remember the lyrics - look at the title.. enough said. 0/10 <br /> <br />#1 Zero: sounds like a stalker theme song.. the guitar part is pretty awesome through out the song. 6/10 <br /> <br />The Curse: desperate sounding song.. trying to make sure some girl doesnt leave or hate him or something. guitar is ok i guess. filler song if i have ever heard one. 5/10 <br />
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This album came out about a year ago originally, but it took me awhile to finally get to it.  Much of this time was spent immersing myself in metal and thrash.  Namely, re-educating myself with industrial Nine Inch Nails metal, jumping headfirst into some early Metallica hits, enjoying Shadows Fall's recent hit The War Within, rehashing my past with Linkin Park and the Deftones, and rediscovering the magic on my Coal Chamber Chamber Music CD.  Now for the Slipknot.    I never was really into these guys...with early hits like Iowa, it always sounded like Ministry jumping into a meat grinder and coming out through a distorted amplifier.  It also bothered me that it seemed to take nine guys (masked, as well) to create that particular brand of metal.  Maybe it just bothered me that they were so downright scary looking.  I suppose that was it.       (...) I grew a little more interested.  They didnt seem to be hiding behind disfigured masks anymore, and the music was more than tolerable: i enjoyed it.       Now I've bought the cd, and I have to confess a certain affinity towards it.  Compared to their previous work, Slipknot have entered more prog-metal territory.  The guitar-shredding is more complex than before, and the throat-shredding is more bearable this time around.  The drum work here is astounding.  On songs like \\"The Blister Exists,\\" Slipknot enters progressive passages of deranged military-esque percussion work.  Equally, the guitars are riff-heavy, hypnotic, and seductive in their energy.       Corey Taylor's vocals are more of a standout on this album than ever before, and his work on surprisingly slower ballads like \\"Circle\\" is genuinely profound.  He seems to be willing to remove the zipper-mouthed mask more often than ever these days.       But the spotlight here goes to Rick Rubin's stellar production.  This year the man is everywhere, and has produced the biggest hard rock acts of modern music.  System of a Down, Weezer, the new Audioslave album, and more.  Here the production is crystal-clear and truly makes the band shine in their element.  Added cellos and string arrangements mellow and age the band's sound, while eclectic texturings make hits like Duality stand out incredibly.       My advice?  Buy an album that Rick Rubin has produced.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002UAX|5.0|I was never a fan of Beatles. I grew up (like the rest of) being aurally assualted by them during every television docu-drama, in every elevator, amidst every familiy road trip. By the time I formed my own musical opinions, I was utterly turned off to anything Beatles so I'll be the first to admit that this cultural inundation prevented me from listening to their music with anything close to a fresh ear. For reasons I cant explain, I re-examined them toward the end of High School. I listened to all the records I was familiar with, namely everything before the White Album and I was impressed. They came up with one adorable melody after another, and paired them with simple lyrical conciets that scanned almost perfectly. None of the music gave me any visceral feeling of musical fulfillment but I must say that there were moments during Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour that came damn close. <br /> <br />A couple months later, I heard the White Album during (gee-wiz) a road trip. I recognized some songs (Ob-la-di, USSR, Blackbird) but most of it was entirely new to me. By the fifth track I began to get that feeling. What I found in the White Album was an intesity and vibrance that was missing from every other Beatles CD (Abbey Road has since become my second favorite). The thing that amazed me most was how or why Lennon and McCartney waited this long to start singing their songs with some fricken balls. There are pre-White Album moments mostly on Lennon tracks like \\"I am the Walrus,\\" or \\"A Day in the Life\\" but thats just what they are, moments. The first disc starts off kind of lukewarm but picks up almost immediately with \\"Dear Prudence\\" and doesn't really begin to let up until near the end. To be sure, there are plently of weak spots: \\"Ob-la-di,\\" \\"Dont Pass me by,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" \\"I Will,\\" \\"Long Long Long,\\" \\"Revolution #9,\\" \\"Good Night\\" which is why most people are quick to critisize this opus since most Beatles albums dont have \\"weak spots.\\" Then again, most Beatles albums dont even come close to the White Albums high points of which there are plenty. Harrisons compositions are generally weaker but succeed (for the most part) on sheer ingenuity. Ringo's song is a good effort but pretty disposable. But even McCartney who provides most of the albums cheese, pulls \\"Helter Skelter\\" out of his hat which is quite possibly the greatest Beatles recording I've ever heard. Each song on the album displays an interesting musical idea and is worth listening to but in the end, the album belongs to Lennon. Every one of his tracks (with the exception of his lengthy Cagian exercise) hits the mark. He succeeds on song after song at being personal, witty, and utterly euphonious all at the same time and he seems to do it more effortlessly than any other Beatle. Thats not to say he didn't struggle with his compositions. Songwriting is hard work even for a musical genius. Lennons specific genius is his ability to compose songs which SEEM effortless and natural as opposed to McCartney's more contrived approach. Nowhere is this temperamental difference more apparent than on the White Album which is one explaination for why its completely schizo. <br /> <br />This lack of coherence provides most of the fuel for White Album detractors who just cant seem to accept the arguement that the very absence of a unifying concept is, in itself, a concept. This was an experimental album in more ways than one in that it SEEMS to force the listener into a song by song experience SEEMINGLY providing a stark contrast to Abbey Road which is nothing if not  a cohesive whole. I believe The White Album can be experienced the same way, though. That is, in fact, why we call it the White Album. Or more accurately, that is why the Beatles didn't give it a real name and made the cover white. You sit back and listen to an array of songs (colors) which are very different (blue, yellow, green, red) when experienced seperately but can also be experienced together as well (white-assuming these colors are light based) thus bringing the listener into a trance-like meditative state--and the Indian influence thus rears its ugly head. In this way, all the supposed filler and mediocre songs serve a purpose. Epstiens death and the ensuing lack of leadership is not the unfortunate cause of the White Album as many people are wont to claim. The Beatles were perfectly capable of not making silly crap like \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" \\"Piggies,\\" or \\"Martha my Dear.\\" They where perfectly capable of opting for a single disc full of grandiose themes and top 40 hits. Instead they chose to make one of the greatest CDs of all time
B00082IJ08|3.0|I just bought the album today and listened to it twice on a long drive. I replayed a couple tracks over and the discovery I made was; this album only has one single on it. What I mean is there's only one strong song on the entire album. The rest of the songs are good but not enough for single release. This stuck me as odd. Last month I bought the new Garbage album \\"Bleed Like Me\\" and I was able to pick out several strong songs that would make for good singles. Not the same case with The Gorilaz. The songs on Demon Days are alright but they're not very strong. The overall album is for consistant musically than the more experimental debut album but much to my dismay Demon Days also has an increased number of rappers & reduced presence of Damon Albarn (aka \\"2D\\", the lead singer of the band). I'll give the record a few more spins but I think my mind is already made up. Demon Days is a good album but not a great one.
B000000W5L|4.0|Nothing more to say.  <br /> <br />Other than anyone notice that the people who give it one star can't spell worth a damn?
B000002J09|2.0|We get it. Led Zeppelin was a great band, possibly the greatest of their time. But f**king get over it. I'm so tired of people who think they are metalheads, yet all they listen to is AC DC, Led Zeppelin, and Metallica. THERE IS OTHER MUSIC OUT THERE. Quit clinging to the past and branch out a bit! Extend your musical horizons! For the love of GOD!
B00006AUIG|5.0|An earlier review had it right on, you have to watch this one a few times to finally get it. I feel asleep the first time I saw it, but something kept me watching it everytime it came on. The atmosphere of the movie and the whole abandoned building/mental hospital is what kept my interest. The idea that this could happen in real life I think is what makes this one truely good. If there were any monsters or killers-that-just-wouldn't-die, it just wouldn't be good. This is one of my favorite movies.
B0000640VO|5.0|I for one really enjoyed this movie; perhaps because I could really relate to the main character. Amelie is essentially the story of a very shy, introverted young woman. People need to keep this in mind when viewing this movie. She is faced with difficult people and problems in her life, and instead of blowing up at these people and problems verbally; she is more cunning and cleaver and helps out using less obvious, more creative means. Yes, she doesn't speak very much throughout the movie, but maybe we need more people like her in the world. People who shut the heck up and figure out problems in more imaginative, peaceful ways. She saw flaws in people's lives and instead of confronting these people, she helped guide them in seeing there errs in more inconspicuous ways, yet she was reluctant to face her own problems in her own life. The ultimate conclusion of the move is that she was finally able to see there were flaws in her own life from lack of confronting her feelings of love. I feel Amelie is a wonderful work of art. This is not one of those Hollywood films that just screams out its message. The film is full of subtleties.
B00006V9A0|5.0|First off id like 2 say this is a very lazy and medicore greatest hits, but i give it 5 stars bc the songs that on here are amazing but nirvana was much better than this shows. This has pretty much all the \\"Must-Haves\\" of Nirvana between \\"nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" very brilliant cds. But Bleach and Incesticide were totally unfairly left out. \\"bleach is probably my favorite nirvana cd. <br />              So now for the songs i feel should have been on here. First off how the hell did \\"been a son\\" get on this cd. So im thinking 4 future nirvana greastest hits make it 2 discs. K so off \\"bleach\\" u have 2 have blew, school, love buzz, and mr moustache(all of which were left off this cd) to be fair, but if i could pick all of bleach would b on there. Off Nevermind the did a good job with this cd on the greatest hits, but i say put lounge act, drain you, and territorial pissings ( which is a hard song, and this greatest hits really doesnt show nirvana's \\"harder\\" side) Off \\"In Utero\\" u put scentless apprentice, frances farmer, and radio freindly unit shifter, and milk it!!!Now off Incesticide i was dumbfounded when i found out dive, and anyerusym were left off this cd they are great songs and 4 the future nirvana greatest that will come out i highly highly recomment those 2 tracks. and also maybe more unrealeased songs cuz on this cd their is only one which goes against nirvana's punk ethos that u shouldnt buy a cd 4 one song. so maybe put even in his youth, and blandest 4 some rare tracks and this is asking 4 2 much but a dvd would b nice!!!
B000003N7K|5.0|No serious lover of music should feel qualified unless they have this piece in thier collection.  It is the performance that eclipses and stands as the bench-mark for all others to live up to.  I think it is time for me to shut up.  In closing, I only wish Hartman had done other recordings with a couple of the \\"Other Masters\\".  I am a young 48 years old and only wish that I could have seen him perform.  Check out Kurt Elling.  I have seen him
B000008LOU|5.0|I JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED A CD WITH VOL. I ( WHICH I HAD ON TAPE ALREADY) AND VOL. 3...OH! THIS IS EVEN MORE SUPERIOR THAN VOL. I, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AN UNTOUCHABLE COMPILATION OF EXCELLENCE. DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THIS! EVERY SINGLE SONG IS RICHLY INTENSE...SHOWING A MATURITY AND NEAR GENIUS GROUP AT ITS PEAK!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a rock fan for 40 years.  Since I got this album for Christmas I've listened to it at least 50 times and it keeps getting better.  I rate the 2 suites, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, as the creme de la creme here.  They remind me of the Mean Mr Mustard/Polythene Pam etc suite from the White Album, with incredibly engaging hooks and melodies that appear for 30 seconds then segue into something totally different. And then they end it with Whatshername, an amusing ode to forgotten girlfriends all can relate to. <br /> <br />Its way too melodious and harmonious to be punk, pop-punk is probably the right term.  Its the same direction Green Day's (and my) heroes the Ramones took as they \\"matured\\", but done here to the highest of standards. <br /> <br />The only criticism I can make is the music is derivative, but then again so is virtually all rock music.  And these guys picked the best (Beatles, Who, U2, Ramones, VU)to borrow from. <br /> <br />Green Day's live show is also pretty spectacular, they play their hearts out and the price is a bargain compared to what has-been classic rock groups (Stones etc) charge.  See em! <br /> <br />PS some of the reviews here are pretty funny, one guy thinks they're a British band, another is mad they have the audacity to throw politics in with music.  Yes I guess we are American Idiots.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Pro's : Every song is brilliant.  Political lyrics work without shoving them down your throat.  Seriously heavy riffs with insane chorus/hooks.  Daron Malakian's vocal style is insane and just adds a whole new presence to the band.  Serj as ever rocks.  My wife is finally learning to like it.  So worth the wait. <br />Con's: Short (but that just makes you put it back on)
1869504917|4.0|I've been on two trips to New Zealand and used the first guidebook on the first trip and the revised edition (after Two Towers) on the second trip.  The revised edition was much improved over the original one.  I visited probably 80%+ of the sites in the book between the two trips.  The guidebooks give a lot of interesting trivia about filming LOTR and can certainly help you decide what to visit, how accessible it is and how to plan a route.  As all have stated, the problem is that the directions get you sort of there, within a hundred meters if you're lucky, and the pictures are marginally helpful. On the second trip I brought a portable DVD player with the LOTR DVDs and I found the relevant scene in the film while I was at the location, so I could make a positive identification and not have to wonder if I was at the right rock or tree. It was particularly useful at Mavora Lakes, Poolburn and Whakapapa, for example, where so much of the scenery looks the same throughout the whole site.  Otherwise, without the DVD, about the only thing to do when you get to Whakapapa using the guidebook is to just look around and know that it was used for the Mordor locations.  With the DVD you can identify the exact spot where the opening title for Two Towers was filmed, among other venues.  If you don't want to drag a DVD player with you, another option I would recommend is to print out screen caps from the films of those locations you really want to identify and take along a notebook filled with them.  Either option is a must for identifying, for example, the Legolas rock at Deer Park Heights, particularly since the rock was flipped 180 in the film.  Ian's book is a good start, but its utility will vary for each person depending on just how precise you want to be in saying \\"I was there.\\"
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is an AMAZING rock band, the best new rock to be introduced, the best rock cd of the 2000's. <br />They ought to be famous forever, this is how amazing they are, and this CD is incredible. <br /> <br />Time is running Out <br />Hysteria <br />Stockholm Sydrome <br />Sing for Absolution <br />Thoughts of a dying atheist <br /> <br />All incredible on their own accord, even greater considering they came from one single band.  <br />Buy this CD if you want something to get over the crap that you last listened to and restore your faith that good rock still exists.
0920668364|5.0|Truthfully, I rarely read this book to my son because it makes me so sad and I cry.  Although I think it is a must have for a children's library adults will not have an easy time reading this book.  My four year old son likes this book and he doesn't process it the same way as I do.  He refers to it as, \\"the book that makes Mommy sad.\\"  P.S. (I also can barely read the Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein to him for the same exact reasons.  Go ahead and buy the book but have a bunch of tissues ready.)
B0000CDLA7|2.0|-  It is very difficult for me to give this album less than three stars, but I know that deep down, the album as a whole just doesn't \\"do it\\" for me. I am the farthest thing from a metalhead that you can find. I listen to Shostakovich. Therefore I am a HUGE Yes fan, and I love all of the other classic Prog rock bands; Genesis, Pink Floyd, ELP, Supertramp etc. I had heard great things about Dream Theater, that they were the best Prog Metal band there is, and also the best \\"third tier\\" prog band. This was the only DT album that my local music store had, so I bought it, after reading the awesome reviews on this website. I experienced reactions that were more mixed than all other reactions I have ever experienced. Commence track by track review now: <br /> <br />\\"As I Am\\" - Not bad. The introduction is a great way to start an album. A shimmering keyboard chord evaporates into an awesome distorted guitar line, followed by loud and slow guitar chords. Then the main body of the song begins, and it speeds along fairly well. <br /> <br />\\"This Dying Soul\\" - Ugggh! What a terrible song! There is no trace of prog in this number. Being a Shostakovich fan, I can't take more than one minute of this. It almost single handedly removed a star from my rating! <br /> <br />\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" - I like the acoustic bits, and I hate everything else. <br /> <br />\\"Honour thy Father\\" - This is very much like \\"TDS\\" to me, but not quite as bad. <br /> <br />By now you may be thinking, \\"He hates this album, where did 3 stars come from?\\" Read on. <br /> <br />\\"Vacant\\" - A nice (if short) ballad of desperation, in which a man loses a loved one. Probably a daughter, judging by the corresponding photograph in the Storm Thergousten (sp?) booklet. This acts as a prologue to the emotions expressed in \\"Stream of Consciousness\\". <br /> <br />\\"Stream of Consciousness\\" - WOW. This lengthyish instrumental is the high point of the album for me. So many musical ideas are packed together in one enormously technical and emotional song. I always have to move when I listen to this song. I usually do air keyboards, as this is my home instrument. Jordan Rudess's brief keyboard excursions make me cry. Great guitar and drums as well. <br /> <br />\\"In the Name of God\\" - WHOA. Another great track. The longest on the album, and with the best lyrics. It talks about how people bend what the Bible says and exploit fanatics for their own gain. The Latin bit is really cool, and this track has some great acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />Now. Why 2 stars? Because I just heard Images and Words. Every song on the album surpasses the first four tracks on this album, but none of it can come close to the last two. This is a good place to start if you want to get into DT, as it will let you know if you like the \\"Six Degrees\\" era, which I have heard is very heavy; or the \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" era, is brilliant prog metal. DONT BUY
0790734060|4.0|Amadeus\\" appears to tell the story of child prodigy Mozart(Tom Hulce)really has more to do with the villainous Salieri (Best Actor Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) who outwardly befriends Mozart but actually undermines him in every way. Inspired y ales of the younger Amadeus as a blessed musical prodigy, Salieri dedicates himself to becoming a virtuoso himself.  Years later, an accomplished and acclaimed composer, Salieri gets to meet Mozart, and discovers that the boy maestro is a vile wonk and is also (and frustratingly) divinely gifted with music.  Though setting up house in Vienna during the reign of the Musical Emperor Franz Joseph (Jeffrey Jones), and recognized for his talent, Mozart soon burns bridges with his uncompromising attitudes towards everything. Strangely, only Salieri can recognize the sheer genius in his work. Though pledging his soul to god in return for the gift of unsurpassed talent, Salieri's exposure to Mozart's music painfully shows the Italian composer how badly heaven has shortchanged him. After one read of a Mozart rough draft, Salieri consigns every crucifix in his house to the fireplace. Despite Salieri's knowledge, Mozart is underappreciated at every quarter, and Salieri's conspiracies prove redundant to hurting Mozart's career. However, when tragedy strikes Mozart, his vindictive enemy learns to direct the stricken genius towards self-destruction. <br /> <br />This was a great story, in every way.  Though the nominal villain, the script slowly but surely makes a reluctant hero of the mediocre Salieri.  Salieri envies Mozart's genius, not his success (the story pointedly illuminates Salieri's popularity at the time and Mozart's marginal acclaim); The rivalry seems all the more poignant because Salieri seems to be the only one who can truly appreciate Amadeus's work.  Late in the film, Salieri tells the dying Mozart that he never missed any of Mozart's performances - a fact that seems hard to deny. If the flick has a villain, it's Amadeus himself - he was dedicated to his music but expended little effort in achieving it. Course, vulgar and conceited, he not only surpassed others, but seemed to do without much trouble. When first meeting Salieri at the emperor's court, the younger prodigy virtually dissects a Salieri work, then puts his own spin on it and produces a clearly superior piece of music. Outside of Salieri's presence, Mozart is openly disdainful of him.  Near the end of the film, the script works up an amazing conceit - with Salieri manipulating Mozart into composing a monumental requiem.  As Mozart's powers ebb, he musters his genius to one last masterwork, one last stab at greatness that he actually has to work for rather than await as a divine gift. <br /> <br />\\"Amadeus\\" is a glorious work in itself. Sumptuous music, scenes and costuming are brilliantly matched with nuanced and honest performances. Director Milos Foreman crowns this by having his cast - done up as they are in period costume and setting - speak their lines without accent or classical affectation, something that would add pretension where none was needed (and an idea that is woefully underexploited). The story, essentially a confession from a dying Salieri, is the painful elegy of the mediocre, and in this, Salieri creates a masterwork to rival Mozart's.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is possibly the most addictive, amazing album I have ever heard. To all those people who complain about the lyrics having no meaning, just take a second to realize that art is a personal thing, even if it is shared with others, meaning is not always something which artists choose to share. This album destroys all pre-concieved notions of what an album should be, what a genre should be. It is beyond description, and probably was meant to be just that. It is literally the best rock album that I know of that has come out since about 1980, and don't try to peg me as a prog fan, this has about as much to do with prog as it does with anything else. It is a melding of all of the musical influences of each member of the band, and as such, it is much more. It is something that must be experienced. If you like top 40 music, just move on. The Widow is the only track that stands a chance of pleasing you, and is easily the weakest track on the album. Seriously folks, this is one of the best rock albums of all time. And I don't say that loosely. I bought this album thinking, well, I'll give it a chance, and within the first couple of minutes it reeled me in. I have listened to it probably 30 times all the way through in the week I have owned it, and I can guarantee that I will listen to it thousands more before I put it on the shelf, if I ever do. One last thought, unless you live nowhere near a \\"Record Store\\" you should skip Amazon and go buy it at an INDEPENDENT RECORD STORE. If you live in Alaska or Idaho or something, then go with convenience and buy it from Amazon. They aren't all bad, but they, along with Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are helping destroy small record stores, and so are YOU if you buy from them instead of supporting your local independent store. That said, I like Amazon, but I don't want to lose my local store, so I always try to see if they can get something before I order it from Amazon.
B00005AWMF|5.0|The Best of Sade is just that...the very best. Aside from her more recent hits, this CD has all the greats. I love this CD so much I purchased it twice...SOMEONE STOLE MY FIRST COPY!  <br />(If that ain't proof it's a hot commodity, I don't know what is) <br />If you were ever a fan of Sade, but you're like me afraid to buy every album for fear of not liking every song...this is a great compromise! I was not a huge fan in the 80's, but I did like many of her releases. I was young then, and now that I am more mature I can really appreciate her sound. She is a one of kind class act. I have played her CD so much, I may find myself buying it a third time! Oh well...it'll be worth every penny!
B0000057C5|5.0|1.) \\"Du Hast\\" means \\"you have\\", not \\"you hate\\". The full line, \\"du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt\\", means \\"you asked me and I didn't say anything\\". German for \\"hate\\" is \\"hassen\\", as in, \\"du hasst\\", which would mean \\"you hate\\". I know Rammstein released an English version of this song entitled \\"You Hate\\", but that doesn't change the fact that \\"hate\\" is spelled with two S's, and \\"[you] have\\" is spelled with one. I hate this mistake so much. Stop making it. <br /> <br />2.) Rammstein are not militant or right-wing. Go look at the [translation of] Links 2 3 4 if you need convincing. <br /> <br />Oh, and the CD's pretty good, too. Five stars!

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This is an amazing cd. Ray's voice and style were amazing and considering that he sings with other amazing singers such as Norah Jones, Elton John and Natalie Cole. Just make the cd a must have. I really love listening to it while writing or being around the house because it makes a lot of company, just relaxes me. <br />This cd made a big impact with multi-million selling status and a bunch of Grammy awards.  <br />It's really difficult to make a review from this album beacuse there's not much new to say because we all know about Ray. The last thing that I can say is that the album is very good and you could give it a try at least listening to the samples so you can make a decision whether you add it to your collection or not.
B00003CWRX|5.0|I Don't know why i let 5 years pass before i sat down, and watched this film - probably b/c im not the biggest russell crowe fan, w/ that said ,i thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie.  From the beautiful cinemetography to the wonderful score, capped off by the excellent acting (pacino,plummer,crowe - in that order) one couldn't ask for more.  The \\"taking on big corporations\\" premise is rarely touched upon by members in hollywood, or if it is - it's very watered down.  This film is a social commentary -  it dissects how corrupt and to what length corporations will go to get their way.  This movie is so deep , and for the thinkers of the world only.  Kudos to Mann, w/ each film i watch made by him - the bigger fan i become.  Please don't pass this one up.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|This movie is hard to follow.  No question about that.  Most movies that are adapted from Broadway plays don't fair well on screen unless they're made from the classic playwrights (Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Eugene O'Neill, etc.).  Many of the negative reviews here on Amazon.com expecting more action are justified.  However, I found the movie to be better than expected.  Mike Nichols is one of Hollywood's finest directors.  And with four of the best actors around, he does very will with the challenging subject matter.  Natalie Portman has become the \\"Harrison Ford\\" of the Star Wars genre by breaking out into a great Oscar nominated role.  British TV star Clive Owen also breaks free of his shell with his excellent performance.  Juila Roberts & Jude Law round out this excellent cast.  If you can stay with it for the performances, you'll be amused.
1878424777|5.0|While listening to The Four Agreements you feel a sense on nostalgia, like, \\"I've heard this before.\\" And pretty much we all have in one way or another; however, the way in which Miquel Ruiz articulates the agreements we all need to make to let go of fears, personal demons, constricting religious strongholds, and blame is unlike I've heard before and he nails it. The first time I listened to the CD I almost cried. It was exactly what I needed to hear to empower myself and not give that power away. It's an assessment of accountability and stepping out of the victim mentality and without the dogma that have many of us stuck or giving our power away and expecting others to solve problems for us.<br /><br />Nothing Miquel Ruiz says in this book or on the CD is new. You've heard it before. But it is a pleasant reminder that is articulated in a way that simply hits home and makes you think and later, act.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Audioslave's second album is quite solid...I'm giving it three stars because it is personally not as much my cup of tea compared to the first album.  The first six tracks off the Audioslave debut hit me like a ton of bricks; it was the most innovative and heavy material Morello had written since the RATM debut over ten years before.  It's a shame that \\"Like a Stone\\" was so incredibly popular because it is obvious that some of the tracks, in particular \\"Be Yourself,\\" are trying to replicate that sound; instead it just comes across as trying to redo a tired song.  When Audioslave and Morello go back to their bread and butter, i.e. powerful songs with riffs only Morello can create, this album stacks right up to the previous one.  The title track and The Worm are both outstanding in this regard.  \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" is interesting and experimental, a bluesy number with a country twang to it that shows the band's ability to gamble on a new idea.  \\"#1 Zero\\" is the best song on the album because it combines bluesy, more downtempo rock with a supercharged metal ending - it is quite a songwriting achievement for Audioslave.  Cornell's voice is in excellent form as usual.  Overall, I think the album suffers from a few duds and is more boring overall than the debut.  However, with songs like The Worm and #1 Zero, Audioslave remains one of the absolute best rock bands on the planet...I can't wait to see where they go from here.
B00000DQSS|5.0|Kate's third release is a combination of her early style with something she later perfected on The Dreaming and Hounds Of Love. She started taking over control producing her own music and included all the ideas she had in her head. Like Kate on the cover, it's like you open you own Pandora's box and let all the weird, spooky and mysterious things out in the open. I never heard this album before my 12th birthday but it still brings back feelings and memories from my early childhood in the forms of dreams and fantasies. This is another essential album for people who like original and daring music.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|SOAD's latest album is a conundrum - good in many ways, inexplicably bad in others, but overall definitely moving the band forward.  Like so many reviewers have done, this album of dualities is best divided up into pros and cons.  One positive about this album is that it is daringly original, even for SOAD.  New, bizarre lyrical topics are entertaining, if sometimes painfully bad (see Cigaro).  The riffs are better, and heavier than ever - SOAD is breaking new ground in this regard (maybe someday we'll see a - gasp - guitar solo).  And SOAD is expanding its sound for better or worse.  Old School Hollywood is a poppy, heavier nod to 80s synth music, with accompanying cheesy robot voice effects.  Now onto the negatives.  The most glaring problem with this album is guitarist Malakian's severe influence - he wrote most of the music and gets waaaaay too much time singing lead vocals - I'd venture to say that 40% of this short album has him singing.  This is dissapointing because a) his voice is not good, and b) serj's voice is what makes this band so interesting and amazing - he has one of the most unique and powerful voices in the rock universe!  The second biggest problem is that the album is very short, and about only half of it is really good.  SOAD will probably come out with something similar in Hypnotize.  I'll bet that the two of them together will have enough songs to combine into a great album.  It just seems that right now, SOAD is suffering from artistic overconfidence.  It is clear that, while they are an innovative and fascinating band, they are not yet talented enough to release a double album of great material.  That being said, Mezmerize is still worth getting.  If you're turned off by the confusing, jarring, goes-nowhere single BYOB, as I was, don't worry - in my opinion it is one of the worst cuts on an album with some great material.

B0006IIKS0|3.0|Bottom line - some things should not be made public. At the same time, watching these guys under a microscope was both enlightening and disturbing. These guys made recording a heavy metal record look and feel like sheer drudgery!!!! They seemed to hate each other for the most part. About 10 minutes into the flick I was left wondering why they even bothered to do it??? Was their management twisting their arms to do this record??? But now as I listen to the CD, I can clearly hear them expressing their love/hate relationship to each other (i.e. \\"I'm madly in anger with you\\"). Some Kind of Monster is appropriately named for this DVD because that is exactly what these guys are feeding. Let's face it, they have enough money to survive on for the rest of their lives. They can afford a $40k a month therapist for God's sake!! What is the motivation to work together to create another metal masterpiece?? There is none! And it comes across clearly in the film. But they feel the need to keep feeding the beast because everyone else is expecting it from them. The bonus feature showing management discussing the future of Metallica after James' heads to rehab is very telling. They are \\"Some Kind of Monster\\". \\"We the people\\" are \\"Some Kind of Monster\\". Lars, James and Kirk still feel the need to feed it despite the fact that they clearly don't love it anymore. Robert Trujillo must be wondering what the hell he got himself into.
B00005JNQQ|3.0|I guess Pixar has spoiled me, because I found ROBOTS sadly lacking in integration between the visuals and a coherent story line. The plot stops periodically to show some neato-looking action sequence or Robin Williams comedy bit, then abruptly resumes again. With all the reports about how short attention spans are today, it makes you wonder what the moviemakers were thinking.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Like others have mentioned this is a movie you will either love or hate. In fact, everyone I know in person has an opinion to those extremes. I find myself in the former, because this movie is easily summed up in one word: Random. Yes, random... I wonder how it was thought up but I find it rather brilliant. So what if MTV Films was a part of this, it's a great movie. I even find people hating this movie quoting it, which is something that is pretty interesting.    If you're looking for a meaningful movie though, you'll be dissapointed. There is like no real point to the movie, although I find that to be part of what's so great. The title character doesn't reveal it, but he's quite skillful: Good artist, dancer, and used it as part of the support to vote for Pedro, someone he had met from his school when he had first came to the school. A part of this movie involved with Napoleon & Pedro is in my title of this review.    He lives with two people: his computer-loving cousin who is almost thirty and his total jerk uncle. The former character falls in love with a woman, Lafawnda, and the latter tried giving friend Deb some shampoo, which dissapoints her, although they do end up doing a dance together for the prom.    He busts his moves more than anything for the class president thing, which resulted in Pedro's victory. It is part of what's really cool, I thought, along with a speech saying that \\"all of your wildest dreams will come true\\". I mean, who wouldn't vote for that.    The greatest thing though about this movie is that it's like a home-made video in many ways, although the whole thing is completely acted. This low-budgetness kind of makes it the great movie it is as it has little to do with its visuals but with its storyline/plot. It is worth seeing multiple times.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|Will Smith has so much charm and charisma; it's hard to understand why he hasn't been in more romantic comedy roles. In this movie, he plays Alex Hitchins, \\"Hitch\\", a date doctor who helps guys with two left feet shape up so that they can make a good impression on the women they want to win. It's a Cyrano story, but in this case the handsome man is supplying the smooth words and actions for the bumbling Romeos-to-be. Eva Mendes is smart and feisty as Sara, who is supposedly a predatory gossip columnist. The film has two (well, three) intersecting sub-plots; Hitch's attempt to help Albert (Kevin James) win the rich socialite of his dream, and Sara's pursuit of dirt on this same socialite (and Sara's best friend has a bad run-in with a rejected Hitch client). The film rolls along really well until the ending, which seems forced and unbelievable.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Despite a poorly-designed DVD cover (the picture of DiCaprio looks huge and demented), this is a classic movie that would make a great addition to your DVD collection.  The story is about Howard Hughes, an aviation genius and pioneer who also suffered from a debilitating mental illness.<br /><br />Hughes is known widely for crazy behavior.  A humorous episode of the Simpsons spoofed Hughes. Mr. Burns, with wild hair and long nails, points a gun at Smithers and orders him to get into a tiny model plane Burns has dubbed the \\"Spruce Caboose.\\"  This is a take on Hughes' famous \\"Spruce Goose,\\" which is featured in the film.<br /><br />Howard Hughes was born in Texas in 1905.  His father invented a revolutionary mining drill bit that revolutionized drilling and kept Hughes in coattails for life, no matter how much money he spent.  Hughes was an orphan at 18, his parents dying within two years of each other.  He was a high school and college dropout, and took over his father's business.<br /><br />Hughes loved airplanes and movies.  His big movie, \\"Hell's Angels,\\" (1930) combined both.  Using a fleet of genuine WWI planes, the movie's budget was insane for the time.  Although the film was a box office smash, he still lost over a million dollars on it.  Hughes founded Hughes Aircraft.  He proceeded to build planes and break speed and distance records.  Some called him \\"the second Lindbergh.\\"<br /><br />Hughes also was a playboy, dating a string of beautiful actresses.  The film is almost as much about them as it is about the billionaire.  Katherine Hepburn's (Cate Blanchett) relationship with Hughes is strongly profiled.  A scene of her family at the dinner table when Hughes meets them is hilarious.  Kate Beckinsdale as Ava Gardner turns in a classy performance.<br /><br />With this performance, that missed a Best Actor Academy Award by a hair, DiCaprio has forever thrown off the mantle of pretty boy/Pack Rat Jr. actor.  His performance is so laudable in every way.  He has really grown up.  Blanchett overacts, unsuccessfully trying too hard to channel Hepburn.  It is like she studied the actress's mannerisms so hard, she forgot to be natural., unsuccessfully trying too hard to channel Hepburn.  It is like she studied the actress's mannerisms so hard, she forgot to be natural.
B00005K3NR|2.0|Carrie is actually 2 seperate movies: the first is about a granola-y teenage girl coming to terms with her body, rejecting her stern, southern mother's religion, and experiencing her life and sexuality in an open, free, 1970's kind of way. *yawn*   The second movie starts so jarringly that it's as if the director suddenly remembered that he was supposed to be filming a horror film. It's this second part, so completely over the top and lacking in any subtlety, that propels Carrie into the stratosphere of unintended cinema comedy.     Some personal reflections upon Carrie:    I think we are so supposed to feel badly for Carrie, when she's doused with pig's blood during her moment of prom glory. Unfortunately, her tormentors scheme was so ingenious and audacious -so completely divorced from anything that would actually work in real life -and DePalma leads up to it by piling one scene of teen girl bliss upon another.. I'm ashamed to admit that I was laughing quite hard when the moment finally arrived.     Incidentally.. Carrie's football-star date has a massive, blond afro/perm. Is it really very likely that an empty, tin bucket swinging into his head would knock him out cold?    Several reviewers, including nominal Catholic Roger Ebert, have remarked that Carrie and her mother pray before a statue of Jesus. Actually, the statue has arrows sticking out of it, so it is of St. Sebastian (though a St. Sebastian strangely defaced with a troll like afro and bug-eyes.) Presumably DePalma made this switch when unable to think of a timely way to telekinetically crucify Carrie's mother (it's held that Sebastian was used for archery practice). The actress playing Carrie's mother gives the best (grindingly one dimensional but that's par for the course here) performance in the film and obviously has a lot of fun with her insane, southern fried bible belter.     Sissy Spacek, a real life Texas prom-queen, was badly miscast in the lead of this film. The film obviously calls for a shy, mousy little girl. Spacek has the face of a tomboy and the shoulders of an olympic swimmer. She looks like she could lift her bullies over head without any telekinetic help. All the same, she does (when covered in blood and with eyes popped open) manage to acheive an unwholesome, Blair Witch like, force of nature quality. But then DePalma electrocutes another teen or sends one flying across the room and the effect is ruined.    Several reviewers commented that they were disturbed by the film's amorality and lack of any redemption for it's characters. This is true, but personally I do not consider this a fault (and it wouldn't be the greatest of this particular movie's problems). Indeed, in a wider way it serves to make this film a perfect product of the decade it was produced in; for what were the 70's if not an insane attempt at suicide on a civilizational level? To finish this review with a comment on the 1970's in general: I'm simply glad they're over and that I don't remember but hardly anything of them.
1881273156|5.0|I have found this book so helpful in my relationship.  It's been nice to discover the \\"love language\\" my boyfriend resonates with so that I can keep his \\"love tank\\" full.  Author, Gary Chapman, suggests that we each have a love language, i.e. words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service or physical touch.  When partners speak each other's love language to the other, both feel love and satisfaction within the relationship (a full love tank).  I love that this book gives people new tools to relating with love.  It's really been fun to try out Chapman's suggestions and reap the loving benefits.<br /><br />Another awesome book that empowers relationships is Ariel & Shya Kanes' \\"How To Create A Magical Relationship\\".  I read this book - this book won the 2007 Nautilus Book Award in the category of Relationships / Men & Women's Issues - and it is accurately awarded!  If you're looking to experience the simplicity and magic of loving relationships (with consistency - really!), you have to check out this book.  The language of love is easy to speak with the help of authors like Gary Chapman and Ariel & Shya Kane.
B00082IJ08|5.0|So dim the lights, put on your headphones, open your mind, and get ready for the journey! You've gotta hear it up close and personal to truly appreciate the masterpiece of this album. Every song is different and unique. The beats are wonderful. I have been listening to it nonstop since I brought it home this afternoon. My only gripe is that there is not enough Damon Albarn, but that's a very small gripe. I love this album. So should you.

Anybody know what song this is or who it's by!?  <br />----------------------------- <br />I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I believe it is Dido \\"Here With Me\\".   That's what I remember at least. <br /> <br />And the soundtrack is very nicely put together, well worth 4 stars.  Good soundtrack for a good movie.
B00080Z53O|4.0|Genre: Foreign, Drama <br /> <br />Genre Grade: B- <br /> <br />Final Grade: B <br /> <br />This film, based on a true story, won the Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film this year but how it succeeded in this I am not sure. While it was a very good and at times powerful film, it seemed to miss the mark completely in making me feel anything for the main character, Ramon (played by Javier Bardem). When you are making a movie about euthanasia you have got to set the audience up for accepting the end (since not many of them are going to be fans of it in this day and age). By the end of the movie I was ready for them to kill him off no matter how it happened because I just didn't think this man had a strong enough desire to die.  <br /> <br />Before I go any further I will say that I myself support euthanasia, but I do so very lightly. I have always thought that if someone wanted to kill themself that they have every right to because it is their own life and not the life of someone else. While I still think that suicide is morally wrong, I think it's something that the person attempting it is the only one who truly understands the situation. No one can TELL someone the correct way to feel. When you step into assisted suicide, I agree it is a completely different thing, but I still think that living your own life is a right, and so we all have the right to end our life. A person such as a quadripeligic should have this same right, and I believe he or she should be given the opportunity to commit suicide despite their physical inability to do so. If someone prepares an injection, for example, and then builds a mechanism to allow the person to finish the act, I think that is one (and possibly the only) proper way of going about euthanasia. While I'm still finding my feet in how I feel about the issue, I do know I support it.  <br /> <br />So why does all that matter in this movie? Because I think that in real life, a person who attempts suicide always has an opportunity toback out, and euthanasia is such a hot political topic that I think it might pressure some into doing this. While I don't know if that was the case here, I just didn't think the movie proved to ME, at least, that Ramon truly hated life enough that he wanted to end it all. He brightened the lives of many around him, but his love for them all was not enough to keep his spirit from wanting to die. And so this confused me, and left me not enjoying the film as much as I think I might have. <br /> <br />The acting and cinematography were absolutely amazing though. Just a side note, heh heh.
0316172324|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Gladwell is a wonderful researcher and communicator.  However, if I did not have the context of William Duggan's works--namely, \\"Napolean's Glance\\" and \\"The Art Of What Works: How Success Really Happens\\"--I would not have appreciated Gladwell's contribution in this field of expert intuition.   <br /> <br />Duggan is a professor of strategy and also a consultant to, um,  consumers of strategic thinking working in the U.S. government.  It seems that some of the less satisfied reviewers of \\"Blink\\" would appreciate the supplementary information from Duggan's work.
B0007OCG56|3.0|Genre: Comedy, Drama <br /> <br />Genre Grade: B+ <br /> <br />Final Grade: B- <br /> <br />This was a good movie with great effort put into it from the cast and director James L. Brooks (As Good As It Gets). However, some moments of pure cheesiness, as well as silly cliches, and some serious over-doing it caused this good movie to fall short of being a great one. However, there are some laugh-out-loud hilarious moments (mostly from Tea Leoni and Cloris Leachman) and some really great dialogue (something Brooks is known for), as sappy as it is. Adam Sandler gives a good performance, especially in his moments of being out of control, you can really sense his calmness is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This movie, though very unbelievable under the circumstances, does its job, and although it has some serious cheese factors, it's still definitely worth seeing. And now for a great line from the movie... <br /> <br />Evelyn Norwich: We have to talk.  <br />Deborah Clasky: Mother, are you buzzed?  <br />Evelyn Norwich: No. I quit drinking weeks ago! No one noticed, but I guess that's a pretty good indicator that I conducted myself quite well when I was drunk. But this isn't about me right now.
0765309408|5.0|I haven't read science fiction since the 1970s, when I was a kid enraptured with the original Star Wars film.  But I saw that 2 eminent professors, whom I read several times a week--Glenn Reynolds (Tenn) and Steven Bainbridge (UCLA)--both loved this book. <br /> <br />It was great.  I started reading on my morning and evening commutes, and had to finish it before falling asleep that same day.  A great mix of a survival tale, with epic plot tension, intriguing physics extrapolation, emotional realism, witty dialogue, and humor.  There was a bit of a contrivance in the last third of the story, but I don't want to lob up a spoiler. <br /> <br />I heard a sequel is in the works, and I'm really looking forward to what happens next to John Perry.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Genre: Foreign/Comedy/Martial Arts/Action <br /> <br />Genre Grade: A+ <br /> <br />Final Grade: A+ <br /> <br />Yes, that's right, I gave this movie an A+. I RARELY hand out the '+' with my A's, so that should say something about how friggin' awesome this movie is. It combines the best of everything you loved about The Matrix, Kill Bill, and Saturday morning cartoons. It is laugh-out-loud funny throughout the entire movie and the experience of watching it is a wild ride. This movie pokes fun and makes reference to many different movies.  <br /> <br />This movie is subtitled but it would not be the same if it was dubbed in English. It has very unrealistic fighting sequences among other things, but reality is not what this movie was going for. The music doesn't let us down either - providing the perfect soundtrack to a perfect movie. <br /> <br />This is by far one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time. Don't let the \\"R\\" rating scare you - it's only because of the violence, even though it's very animated. Check this one out in theaters now!!
B0000541AM|4.0|The Warriors is an entertaining piece of puffed up macho gang fluff.  The story has a comic book simplicity, but Walter Hill moves the not-exactly-easy-to-swallow story along with such gusto I still liked it.<br /><br />Cyrus, the leader of the most powerful gang in NYC, the Grammercy Riffs, has asked nine members from the 100 most powerful gangs in New York to convene for a conclave.  The film opens as gang members make their way towards the chosen spot.  We see our heroes, the Warriors, and we're told that Cyrus is \\"the one\\".  Hundreds of gang members arrive wearing their \\"colors\\", but \\"not packing\\".  Unfortunately, one gang, the Rogues, is led by David Patrick Kelly as Luther, at the beginning of his film career playing psychotic criminals, and the Rogues bring a pistol to the meeting.<br /><br />Cyrus stands before the assembled toughs and gives them a broad plan to form a gang alliance to stop gang warfare and begin taking over the city, one \\"turf\\" at a time.  Standing in the middle of a large crowd, Luther shoots Cyrus dead, and in the chaos that follows Luther loudly accuses The Warriors of murdering Cyrus.<br /><br />The Warriors have come the furthest of all the gangs, from Coney Island to the Bronx, and they run for it, but not before Warrior leader Cleon is overcome by Grammercy Riffs and other gang members.  The 8 remaining Warriors are now led by Michael Beck, who looks more like a Calvin Klein model than a gang member.  The remainder of the film is about The Warriors trip back to Coney Island.  Every gang in New York is after them, fueled by a radio DJ who gives instructions and locations.  The police give chase as well.<br /><br />The script is an opportunity for much macho posing.  James Remar is a hoot as Ajax, the most hot-headed Warrior, who hates the running, loves making ridiculously macho come-ons to women, and would apparently love nothing better than to beat up every gang member from one end of New York to the other.  Deborah Van Valkenburgh abandons her neighborhood gang to follow Beck and the rest of the Warriors back to Coney Island.  She serves no purpose other than to have a female character in a movie aimed squarely at an audience of testosterone-laden men.<br /><br />There are many choreographed chase and fight scenes.  Several motifs recur:  In a fight any Warrior is superior to any 2 or more members of any other gang.  There are multiple scenes of outnumbered warriors battling larger numbers of other gangs, and although we're reminded that the Warriors \\"aren't packing\\" (in keeping with the original agreement to attend Cyrus' meeting), we see them beat up multiple other gangs who outnumber them and are armed with guns, baseball bats, etc.<br /><br />Will they make it back to Coney Island?  Will it be discovered that Luther is Cyrus' real killer?  A full 5 stars on the macho meter, but I'll give it 4 overall.o follow Beck and the rest of the Warriors back to Coney Island.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|Genre: Dark Romance    Genre Grade: A+    Final Grade: A    This was a great movie - except it's possibly one of the most verbally sexual movies I've ever seen - but I can handle a little sex talk! There were about, I dunno, eight people or so who walked out of the movie because of the offensive language and sex talk. This movie breaks many barriers and talks about problems in relationships and tries to take a closer look at the raw emotions of affairs. The acting was Oscar-worthy from each person, Clive Owen coming out on top in my opinion. Natalie Portman was amazing as well, and Julia Roberts actually gives the audience something new.    This movie is extremely depressing, and is not a date movie unless you want to walk away feeling hopeless. It leaves us with a despairing look at humanity and our own desires, and the film brings to light things that are normally left in the bedroom or simply remain unspoken. Definitely worth seeing just for the performances (especially the amazing encounter between Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, and then later the discussion between Jude Law and Clive Owen), the AMAZING dialogue, and just because of the fact that Mike Nichols directed it.
0613033574|3.0|Krakauer did a good job cobbling a book together from the scant scraps of information available. However, his characterization of McCandless as a young idealist became ever more grating the more I read. He was one of the most selfish people of which I have heard; disapearing from his parents' and family's lives one day without trace while communicating regularily via letter and postcards with strangers he'd met along his journeys. How could he stroll to his doom with a backpack full of Tolstoy and rice with nary the faintest prick of conscience as to how his parents felt in the two years since he'd spoken to him to them, before he'd begun his 'journey'. McCandless was a man generous and friendly to strangers, indifferent and callous to his parents.  He was a fool possessed of neither the basest of common sense nor conscience. He was nobody's hero.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Genre: Drama <br /> <br />Genre Grade: A <br /> <br />Final Grade: A- <br /> <br />Yes, this was the first time I have ever seen this movie. I am trying to watch movies that won Best Screenplay Oscars, since I've seen just about every Best Picture winner from the past 15 years. This one won Best Adapted Screenplay. It was based on a John Irving book and he wrote the script for the movie. I really want to read his books because he wrote this book as well as The Door in the Floor and Simon Birch, and the critically-acclaimed A Widow for One Year. Anyway, this was an excellent film, very powerful and dealing with some very controversial subject matter.  <br /> <br />I am extremely pro-life, but I did agree with a couple of the lines from Michael Caine in it - that if he didn't do it properly then the pregnant mother was going to do it herself or have an amateur do it. If abortion has to be legal, I think it should be done safely, as not to accidentally end two lives instead of just one. And outside of that topic was a great story about an orphanage and how far one person will go to redeem value to their life. Great movie, I definitely recommend seeing it.
B00006AFUR|1.0|Ok, this album can be judged solely on the song \\"Echelon\\" alone.  Google the lyrics.  Seriously.  The song is a nonsensical compilation of big words that Jared Leto thought sounded cool together.  I don't understand how music like this gets popular.
6304806426|4.0|Genre: Drama, Romance <br /> <br />Genre Grade: A- <br /> <br />Final Grade: A- <br /> <br />This was a great love story, definitely one that achieved \\"classic\\" status immediately. I personally enjoyed the scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas the best, although all of the movie was good. I don't know that I have seen Juliette Binoche in any movies before, but now I'd like to see some more with her in them. She won a supporting Oscar for this film. Ralph Fiennes did a wonderful job as well.  <br /> <br />Some parts of this movie are somewhat boring, but if you pay close attention to the love story within the film then you won't be disappointed by the end of the movie. Director Anthony Minghella knows how to direct love stories like no one else. Although I enjoyed his more recent film, Cold Mountain, immensely more than this movie, I still thought this one was incredible. <br /> <br />Honestly though, this film did NOT deserve winning the Oscar over Fargo for Best Picture. Fargo broke so many barriers and offered so many new and unique filming techniques and yet still offered an unforgettable story and superb acting from everyone in the film. The English Patient, while wonderful, does not even begin to meet that kind of level of filmmaking. I'm sorry if you disagree, but I would definitely have to argue that the Academy got it WRONG that year.
0670033375|4.0|The first and probably most interesting part of this book looks at archeology and, in some cases, written records to explore the collapse of various past civilizations.  Diamond's analysis is that they fell for similar reasons, generally linked to environmental stress.  Some themes show up repeatedly in this section: cultures grow to high population density in years of good climate, leading to disasters when droughts or temperature changes make the environment less hospitable.  When a given environment can no longer support its present population, the population often falls back not to the new maximum support level, but to much less or nothing at all, due to civil war and collapse of existing social structures.  Diamond admires and explains the remarkably ingenious steps used by 'uncivilized' peoples to survive in extremely challenging circumstances; one chapter discusses how early Polynesians managed the incredible feat of setting up permanent homes on an island with no stable source of fresh water.  He also points out how social elites have often responded to crises with hugely inappropriate projects: the classic example, discussed at length here, is the famous giant statues of Easter Island. <br /> <br />Subsequent chapters look at various modern societies and their responses to environmental crises.  An interesting chapter points out that Rwanda, prior to the genocide there, was severely strained by overpopulation which left most subsistence farmers, the core of that nation's economy, working farms too small to feed even their families, much less sell excess for profit.  He also discusses the distinct histories of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, arguing that strong environmental policies are crucial to why the latter is relatively well off, while Haiti is by far the poorest country in the hemisphere. <br /> <br />The final section gives an overview of various modern environmental problems and what can be done to address them.  Diamond's decision to keep this section fairly short is understandable and probably correct - the book runs to over 500 pages as it stands.  But going over so much territory so quickly makes this section the least satisfying.  The final chapter in particular is really the outline of another book, but trying to pack all the material into a few pages leads to a superficial and unstisfactory treatment.   <br /> <br />Overall, this isn't quite as strong as Diamond's justly famous \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", but still a compelling and persuasive book.
0767830555|4.0|Genre: Drama, Thriller <br /> <br />Genre Grade: B <br /> <br />Final Grade: A- <br /> <br />This was a great movie from director Martin Scorsese. This was the first time I ever saw this movie and I was very impressed with how well Scorsese handled it. Robert De Niro gave one of the best performances of his career in this film and it's definitely worth seeing just for that. Jodie Foster was great in her supporting role, even if her character is so controversial (she's a child prostitute). All of Scorsese's films have this certain controlled madness to them. I think you can see it in this movie most of all, but it's also very apparent in his most recent film, The Aviator. He's so good at dealing with psychological disorders in his characters. Although I was disappointed with the ending (it lacked oomph, in my opinion, for how much build-up this movie had), I still thought this was a great movie.
0441012906|5.0|Not long after the end of World War II, American jazz musician Wendell Floyd came to Paris to play.  Though he had some gigs, he and his band partner Andre Custine earn their keep as private investigators.  French landlord Blanchard hires them to investigate the death of a tenant Susan White; the cops declared her death a suicide or accident, but their current client believes a homicide occurred.<br /><br />Three hundred years later, the earth is a frozen wasteland devastated by the twenty-third century technological calamity the Nanocaust.  Archeologist Verity Augur leads a dig beneath the icy landscape of Paris until an assistant is killed during the excavation.  Verity expects to be blamed and her career aborted when the tribunal hearing rules.  Still, she keeps working as the bureaucracy is slow to begin the inquiry.  Soon she finds \\"threads\\" that tie her present to 1950s Paris and the route to arrive in this warmer upbeat city.  There she meets Wendell; they quickly realize they need one another to solve their respective scenarios; neither expected nor prepared for an overarching revelation that they find in the Paris Metro that could destroy space occupying both worlds.<br /><br />CENTURY RAIN is an exciting mixing of an urban noir inside a fabulous quantum physics based science fiction thriller.  The story line is action-packed, moving back and forth between the ages but mostly commingling in the 1950s.  Wendell and Verity are a fine pairing while the support cast enhances understanding of both ages and the string that bounds time and place.  The set up for the finale is so good that a wonderfully developed finish feels almost anti-climatic as Alastair Reynolds is at his best.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
6305327041|3.0|Genre: Comedy <br /> <br />Genre Grade: C+ <br /> <br />Final Grade: B- <br /> <br />Tim Roth gives a hilarious performance in this collection of four short films by four different directors. Allison Anders directed the first segment of the film. She is pretty much an unknown and according to this part of the film, she isn't much of a director. Alexandre Rockwell (In the Soup) directed the second segment, and it was hilarious and quirky and entertaining, which lifted my spirits for this seemingly stupid film. Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Desperado) did an excellent job in the third segment of the film, giving the best direction in the whole film. Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill) wrapped up the movie with his segment, but it didn't compare to the dark humor that Rodriguez gave the film. Tarantino did stick to his roots though, writing great dialogue and having a little fun with shock value too. His mistake is that he wrote himself into the script and gave the worst acting out of anyone else in the film.  <br /> <br />In the end this was a funny and interesting compilation of stories that ultimately makes Tim Roth look like a hysterical madman. Check it out if you enjoy any of the directors of the film or if you like Tim Roth.
B0006213WG|2.0|This cd was more metal than I expected.  Just know that before you buy it.  I should have listened to the sample music.  If you like the harder stuff, you will probably like this.  But if you like the sillier, punk stuff you probably won't.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Genre: Action, Drama, Dark Comedy <br /> <br />Genre Grade: A <br /> <br />Final Grade: A <br /> <br />This was a spectacular movie with great achievements on all levels. Robert Rodriguez hasn't made a movie this good since From Dusk Till Dawn in 1996. However I think he has found an entirely new element and I hope he makes a sequel to this awesome flick soon.  <br /> <br />I am not even going to comment on the amazing cinematography and style of this film because it's so obvious that it is top-notch. I will comment on the story though - a strong one that molds together to fit into a story that comes together in the end without ever confusing the audience as to what is going on and who is who. The dialogue seemed like it had been written by Tarantino himself, sticking to the classic, bold lines that make you grin and really root for the characters. Even Jessica Alba did a great job in her acting! I do wish Britney Murphy would have been in more of it, she is a great actress and so underrated, in my opinion. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, and Mickey Rourke all did a great job with their characters as well.  <br /> <br />Great movie, but definitely one to keep kids away from. It is extremely gruesome (not so bad since it's in black and white) and it steps across new boundaries in mainstream film. Think Silence of the Lambs meets Se7en meets classic crime drama, and you got Sin City. Great movie!! <br /> <br />Oh, and I found out which part of the film Tarantino directed. It's about a 3-4 minute sequence and once I found out it was quite obvious that it was Tarantino who had directed it. If ye want to know, ask and it shall be known to ye.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|My impression of many of the negative reviews of this album - and some of the positive ones - is that folks are too caught up with how this band fits into a \\"scene\\", or making fine distinctions of cool and meta-cool (e.g., independent music that isn't detached and ironic enough should be derided).<br /><br />  Me, I'm some guy in my mid-30's who hasn't a clue what is cool anymore, or cooler-than-cool, but just tries like heck to search out interesting music by browsing the Web and trading suggestions with friends.  And \\"Funeral\\" - which I only heard about a year or so after it came out - is one of my favorite finds in recent years.<br /><br />This is passionate, beautiful, rich, yet catchy-as-all-heck pop music.  It has touchstones in the past (to me, I hear Talking Heads and Sugarcubes, but this is richer and warmer music) but sounds fresh and forward looking.  The lyrics interleave melancholy and regret with passion and hope so finely that the differences among these are obliterated.  Check out \\"Haiti\\" - the only song with any overtly political level to it: \\"All the tears and all the bodies bring about our second birth\\" - and this is set to some of the catchiest, slinkiest, and most sensual rhythms you'll hear in pop music.<br /><br />It's rare to hear such sustained inspiration on an album, much less a debut album. It actually brought tears to my eyes!
B0007Y08I8|3.0|Genre: Comedy <br /> <br />Genre Grade: B+ <br /> <br />Final Grade: B <br /> <br />I was suprised that I actually liked this movie. I figured it would be funny since it came from the guys behind South Park, but I didn't think puppets could be this funny. From the extremely cheesy music to the soap opera acting of the puppets, you will be cracking up throughout the whole movie. This movie pokes fun at conservatives more so than anything, but it also takes a lot of jabs at hardcore celebrity liberals, which is also very funny. This movie is dripping with satire. I bet if I went back and watched it again I would find another joke that has some satirical message behind it about our government.  <br /> <br />If you're a conservative you might not like how this movie throws the facts right out there and then makes fun of them, but hopefully it would make you realize the absurdity of some of the conservative ideals. I think the same can be said for liberals, even if Matt Stone and Trey Parker are just making fun at their devout practice of freedom of speech.  <br /> <br />This film also contains some extremely graphic content, but it's all puppetized so it's just funny.
B00097DX3U|3.0|The second CD from the SuperBand that is Audioslave is simply more of the same music that we got with the first record. There are no edges pushed, there are no signs of musical brilliance or depth, and in the end it's a few interesting riffs and Chris Cornell wailing away. <br /> <br />I expected more.
B00004U8P9|3.0|Genre: Musical/Horror/Romance/Comedy <br /> <br />Genre Grade: B+ <br /> <br />Final Grade: B <br /> <br />My friend Nicki has been pestering me for months to watch this movie so I finally did, and I think she is going to kill me when she reads my review of it. I think I'm being fair in giving it the grade that I am.. Keep in mind that this is only MY opinion of the film, and I can definitely see why this movie has such a large cult following. It is extremely original and very unique, not to mention risque for its day and age.  <br /> <br />This is one twisted movie. The music was interesting, the costumes and characters outrageous, but I think this movie faltered greatly in having a strong story. It jumps all around between a transvestite who owns the mansion, the newly engaged couple who originally just wanted to find their friend Dr. Scott and tell them the happy news, to the Frankenstein-esque monster named \\"Rocky\\" who looks like he's an anorexic steroid-addict. Between the high-pitched singing, the wild sets, and the annoying characters, this movie is probably one of the most \\"out there\\" movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br />And thus is the reason why I think this movie is respected so much. While I was not crazy about it, I do think it was well-made (the cinematography is very Kubrickish) and did entertain despite its seemingly random plot. I suggest this film to anyone who enjoys musicals, because I swear you've never seen anything quite like it. I might compare this movie to Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but in reality they're nothing alike. And...I actually enjoyed Hedwig a little more.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave followed through with this album proving themselves the most solid band in rock today.  When the ex-members of Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell first got together I thought of Audioslave as more of a \\"project\\" than a band never thinking they would accomplish leaving their mark in music history(again) as a group.  I was very impressed with their debut(granted with that much talent it should be expected) and highly anticipated it's follow up.  It delivered completely.  The guys sound more like a cohesive band than ever.  Tom Morello is probably the most innovative guitar player today, manipulating every effect imaginable out of his instrument.  Chris Cornell is still one of the top vocalist in rock music (in my opinion competing only with Andrew Sudderth of Fair To Midland([...]) for the #1 position).  Two of the greatest bands of the 90's have officially made history by becoming one of the greatest bands of the 2000's.
B000005HLV|3.0|I've read so much about this album from many sources <br />and I anticipated that I would hear something great. <br />Well, I have to say I was initially disappointed.  <br />I think that those who want \\"atmosphere\\" need to hear <br />the works of \\"Xasthur\\" if they want minimalist black <br />metal that truely moves you. This album is very repetitive. <br />It seems as if all the songs start on the same note, but proceed just slightly different from the previous song. <br /> <br />Hey I like the album a bit. On some days I'd give it 6 out of 10, and when life really sucks I'd give it a 7. I don't think <br />Atila did anything for me. I do really like the split Mayhem <br />did with \\"Meads of Asphodel\\" \\"Dead\\" seems like a better vocalist. <br />In fact, I almost like every black metal singer better the Atila. Why this is the best black metal CD ever I will never <br />understand. And I am open-minded enough to enjoy all types of it. Hell, Varg on Burzam sounds way better. He captures the essence well and moves you far more than Atila.  <br /> <br />Also, check out Bestial Mockery. Now that's a great band! They may be tormented, but at least they sound like they want to live another day; so they can drink most likely.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This is easily one of the best CDs I've heard this year(possibly this millennium). Josh Homme creates a world of children's fairytails haunted by nightmares better than anyone since obvious influences Black Sabbath.  Nick Oliveri may be Stone Age history, but this album comes across as the most consistant of all QOTSA.  It is not as heavy as SONGS FOR THE DEAF without Dave Grohl's pounding drums, but the phsycadelic trip guides your emotions with great melodies, catchy riffs and tripped out sounds like cowbells and the annoying beeping of a phone left off the hook that blends perfectly.    (...)
B000002UA2|3.0|Review no. 107. Originally released in 1972, this looks to be Pink Floyd's seventh lp - including compilations. 'Obscured By Clouds' have never exactly been one of my favorite Floyd albums, although I'm not saying that it's a bad effort. I thought that it is definitely a bit different than their other recorded works. Thought that this CD reissue's instrumentals - like the title track \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", \\"When You're In\\" and \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" were decently played. Even sort of got something out of the somewhat funky \\"Childhood's End\\", the ballad \\"Burning Bridges\\" and maybe even the occasionally (heard on FM radio late night) \\"Wot's ... Uh The Deal\\". As a whole, this record had simply failed to -thrill my gorilla-. Floyd fanatics will most likely get more out of this title than I did. Hear it for yourself.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is(in my humble opinion) a classic the likes of Metallica's BLACK or Guns 'n Roses APETITE FOR DESTRUCTION!  Linkin Park debuted with an eclectic but still distinct hard rocking sound that took everything everyone else was doing at the time and stepping it up to the next level.  Chester Bennington can sing soft melodies and scream with the best.  Mike Shinoda is a capable MC with heartfelt lyrics unlike most rap-metal bands around the turn of the century.  Joseph Hahn's use of turntables and samples adds enough depth to the music that there is truly something for everyone.  This is truly one of the incredible debuts that come around very rarely.  I'm hoping once Fair To Midland(WWW.FTMBAND.COM) are signed they might have such an impact.
0930289455|4.0|How I wish Moore would write more Batman stories and graphic novels. I remember reading this 16 odd years ago, and it was such an event then. Bolland had spent 2 years or so drawing the artwork for this seminal piece. <br /> <br />Yet, somehow, when it was published, I was left a bit unsatisfied. It was good, very good and it still is. But I had felt that not enough was done with the potential that came with MOore, Bolland and the Joker origin story. It was very artsy as you would have expected from Moore with the panels leading from one scene into another elegantly. <br /> <br />Yet, the crippling of Babs Gordon and the humiliationg of Jim Gordon, felt a bit excessive at that time. Stil the showdown between Batman and Joker is a classic. The exchanges, and the final joke. I just felt that 48 pages was too little to contain what could have been a bigger epic to fulfill. <br /> <br />Yet this remains a very popular classic and will thrill and entertain to those who has never been exposed to Moore and Bolland. A flawed masterpiece.

B00004Y6NT|5.0|When I first listened to the first Dire Straits album, back in the Seventies, I was instantly drawn to them. There was too much going on in the music scene at that time, sonically that is, and suddenly, here comes a band with a no-distortion guitar sound, with down-to-earth themes-mind you, those themes had their own spirituality- and, most important, with the ability to touch us all with music and words that speak directly to our hearts and souls! Am I exaggerating here? (...)    I do feel though, that, while other bands and artists at that time felt the need to create a complicated \\"progressive rock sound\\" aiming at impressing their young and inexperienced audience, these guys took their themes out of the harsh reality of life and made them songs, without bothering to sugar-coat them or disguise them in any way...and yet, the beautiful simplicity of their music is breathtaking!    I was born and raised in Athens, Greece, a city where life is damn difficult, but also a city that has never lost its soul, and this is where the first big success came for Dire Straits: Over 40,000 sales for their first album and at least as many for Communique, almost overnight!!!!  And this album was much inspired by the Greek way of life, especially the last song, \\"Follow Me Home\\", which Mark Knopfler wrote after the band visited the island of Rhodes. Having lived in Rhodes for three years, I can totally relate to that song...    I must say, I enjoyed what Dire Straits did after \\"Communique\\". I like \\"Making Movies\\" and even more I like \\"Love Over Gold\\", the second Dire Straits album to deeply touch my soul, especially after going through the 80's recession in British Columbia, Canada.    I still maintain though, that, \\"Communique\\" is a unique album. Despite some sonic similarities with their first album, especially in the opening tracks of \\"sides A & B\\", the feeling here is distinctly different from their first LP. I won't go through the individual songs here, other reviewers have done this already, and the fact is, I like all the songs.    My advice to all the listeners is simply to just relax, listen to this CD and get the feeling of it!  Enjoy!
B00005JMYI|3.0|This is a scattershot comedy that ended up frustrating me. The parts that were funny, had me laughing until I couldn't breathe and the parts that didn't work had me looking at my watch waiting for them to move on. The basics are Will Ferrell plays a 70s era local news anchorman who is very popular and works and parties with his crew: weatherman, sports reporter and field reporter. Christina Applegate arrives as a beautiful young reporter trying to move in on what has been a male-only broadcast. This was a lot like a Monty Python movie in that it seemed more like a group of sketches loosely tied together to try to make a coherent movie. In this case when it works it's extremely funny and clever. But when it doesn't, it's just stupid.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I never expected this band to become as great as they are. If they continue they will be looked at equally as Rage Against the Machine. (Thats a big if) A lot of solid songs here. I agree the first album is better, but hey this album is great too. The whole album is easy to listen to with no filler.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is great. 'Nuff said. The DVD has some really interesting extras in it where they show you the castle it was shot at and which rooms all the scenes were in.<br /><br />If you are a Monty Python fan, this is a great DVD to add your collection.
B0006399FS|5.0|Stop with the negative reviews. If you don't like U2 thats fine. Facts are is that U2's last two albums keep getting better and better. Maybe their sound sounds the same but each album gets better as time goes by. From start to finish this album is great. I love Pearl Jam a lot also but overall their albums in the past five years haven't been this good.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I think this is maybe the worst album from DT. I'm completely amazed how unique their playing is and how much their songs vary in the previous albums. DT is unlike many bands... for example if you've heard one metallica album, you've heard them all, but every DT album is different. Again, they've made an album that's definantely different, but unfortunately it's no good. It's not that i don't like heavy stuff, it's just that i don't like DT:s heavy stuff. The reason heavy doesn't fit DT is James LaBrie. His voice is no good. I get cold shivers when he tries to scream high notes especially in the live performances... on the other hand his voice is nearly perfect in vacant and other albums like six degrees. On ToT his singing melodies are almost nothing compared to what they've been in many other albums. But why in the world does he rap in this album? Another dissapointment is Petrucci. How can, in my oppinion, the best guitarist in the world make this kind of s*it? How can his guitarplaying be so mindless shredding... no musicality at all. Every song on the album execpt vacant has a solo. Nothing wrong with that if the solos were good and would vary but they're all as fast as petrucci can play with no musical content at all. I just hate seeing such a good player doing this kind of music. Before his playing has been something that i've never experienced before. No guitarist in the world has made such great music that i never get bored listening to it. His live performances in the mid 90:s are incredible. For example Steve Vai is a good guitarist, but he's a bad musician. Most of his music is boring and unoriginal... it's meaning is only to show how technically proficient he is... I think petruccis playing has gone to the same point in ToT... his solos have no idea... or atleast if there were an idea you couldn't here it because it's played so fast its. Playing fast should be a tool to accomplish expressing a feeling for example or something. Fast parts should balancethe slow parts to make the music more alive. Speed shouln't be the purpose itself like on ToT it is. The album has it's good moments too. Vacant balances the albums heavy songs, and does a great job at it. Stream of Conciousness i think is the best song off of the album...the most musical and it has a good feeling to it in the name of god is also great but maybe a bit too long. As for the first 4 songs... they are awful. As i am,The dying soul and honor thy father sound almost like any angry teen music... they have their good parts also but it doesn't help much. Endless sacrifice has atleast some effort. After hearing other DT albums, it isn't just enough that the songs are ok, they have to have something that makes me listen to them over and over again. The 4 first songs definantly aren't those kinds of songs. I think everyone of you who read these appreciate good music... otherwise you wouldn't listen to dream theater. Because of this i have to suggest you all listen to a german band called Superior. I think it's the best that heavy metal as a genre can offer. The singer is amazing and their music is just incredible compared to train of thought. And if many of you consider Train of Thought good... well you should really listen to it. Please e-mail me if you something you would like to say or maybe try to convert me into liking the album :)  <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|This cd really rocks!!  Everyone shines on this release, especially Tom Morello.  It's great to hear some old school rock with a modern edge.  Thanks guys!!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|i agree with the last review- but i think its worse- not good prog- check out the new pagan's mind or symphony x instead!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|You know, from reading these reviews, it's quite obvious to me people just don't get these guys.  They are, hands down, rock visionaries.  I love their humor, politics and keen sense of punk-metal sensibility.  SOAD are the Queen/Led Zeppelin/Frank Zappa of our generation.  Great, although short in time, cd!  I'm eagerly anticipating Hypnotize. I love these crazy Armenians!
0393035158|4.0|In this hotly controversial book, author Sam Harris faults religion for being illogical, for inciting societies to violence and for not reconciling faith and reason. Many classic thinkers and theologians struggled with this question, including Maimonides and Aquinas, who are absent from the index. Such omissions lead one to acknowledge the author's passionate writing perhaps more than his scholarship, which is also open to some challenge as he explains the tenets of various faiths. Harris, who has a compelling narrative style, provokes readers to confront their own philosophies as he asks another ancient question: why does a good God permit evil? Harris's anti-religious discourse promotes reason as a panacea and asserts that spiritual living does not require religious practice. He particularly examines the role of extremist religious belief in its most violent manifestations, such as Jihad. He asks why polite society cannot criticize religion if it motivates suicide bombers and terrorist attacks. Unfortunately, however, Harris follows the Pied Piper of rationalism off the cliff by articulating a dispiriting, dangerous message against tolerating religious tolerance itself. If you want to provoke some spirited conversations, or reconsider venerable philosophical issues in the light of difficult modern times, we believe this may intrigue you. Readers who share Harris' fury about religion's influence will find their opinions vigorously supported, while those who believe that religion is a force for good will find that reading this book is an opportunity to exercise the patience of a saint.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Je viens de recevoir ce coffret et, comme celui de la saison 2, les DVD semblent être dézonés. Je peux parfaitement les lire sur tous mes lecteurs zone 2. Cela est d'autant plus bizarre qu'il y a bien marqué qu'il s'agit d'un zone 1 sur la boîte. Enfin, c'est une bonne chose sachant qu'en France, ce coffret ne sortira probablement jamais.<br />Un mot sur la série elle-même : Gilmore Girls est l'une des meilleures séries produite par la télévision américaine ces dernières années (à égalité avec Veronica Mars). A voir et à revoir.
B00004Y6NV|3.0|I really started getting into Dire Straits right before On Every Street came out. In the course of 6 months I had bought all of their previous recordings and was listening to them religiously. So of course I was elated when I happened to catch the video for \\"Calling Elvis\\" on MTV. If you haven't seen it it is awesome, it features characters from the show Thunderbirds. So I waited, brimming with anticipation until the release of the record. Yeah, I had read a few bad reviews before the release of the record, but I overlooked them trying to give Mark Knopfler and co. the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, the reviews were right on the mark. <br /> <br />True, the record starts off great. \\"Calling Elvis\\" is a fun song and makes you want to hear what the rest of the record has to offer. The next song \\"On Every Street\\" is perhaps the best song Dire Straits has ever written. Once again, Mark Knopfler tells us a story of desperation, longing and bittersweet hope. And my, the melodies alone send shivers down the spine. After this, however, the record starts taking a dive.  <br /> <br />First of all, there is way too much country music on here for me. Yes, Dire Straits' music has always had a country influence in it but some of these songs are straight up Nashville. If I wanted to buy a country record I would buy Garth Brooks, not Dire Straits. A warning label should have been issued with the record so us fans would have known there was going to be a switch in genre. <br /> <br />Second of all, the rest of the songs on the record that are good (i.e. the bluesy and lusty \\"You and your Friends\\" and the jazzy, with a Santana solo at the end, \\"Planet of New Orleans\\")don't even come close to their masterpieces of old like \\"Your Latest Trick\\". <br /> <br />Last but not least, it seems on some songs Mark Knopfler has completely run out of ideas, because he rewrites a few of their old songs into new and lamer versions. Thus, Money for Nothing becomes \\"Heavy Fuel\\" and \\"The man's toStrong\\" becomes \\"Iron Hand\\". And neither matches the glory of their origin. Another hint at his lack of new ideas becomes apparent in the appaling lyrics of \\"My Parties\\" and \\"Heavy Fuel\\". You truly start to wonder if this is the same man who wrote \\"Telegraph road\\".  <br /> <br />But for all of that I wouldn't rule this record out. If you are a Dire Straits fan it is worth getting for the half of the record that is good. I would hate any Dire Straits fan to miss out on the feeling of sitting in some seedy jazz club in \\"Fade to Black\\" and driving down a dimly New Orleans street in \\"Planet of New Orleans\\" simply on account of my review. Yeah, their are lame songs but thank God almighty for skip buttons and used cd's so you don't have to pay full price for a record that is only half good.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Forgettable horror/MTV style vanity project lacks a script that makes sense and a leading man who is believable in the role. Keanu Reeves stinks up the screen in one of the worse performances of his career in one of his worse movies ever as a private detective who is trying to stop the coming of the apocalypse. To say to Keanu is miscast is a real understatement because he's worse thing about the entire film. His dried delivery of his lines are legend and will be remembered as one of the biggest fowl up since Batman and Robin of a comic book adaptation. The script is horrendous and the direction lacks professionalism not to mention focus. The only actor in the entire film that does give a real and believably performance is Rachel Weisz, who does more for this film than she should have because her performance is way better than the movie. She's so good in fact that she almost single handedly redeems Keanu's acting, and I mean almost. That's real talent.  <br /> <br />The one star is definitely for Rachel Weisz for at least trying to give the audience someone to care about while the movie itself is forgettable.  <br />
6305090564|1.0|Don't know how anyone can like this movie, i saw it on TNT late night. Some of those movies are good, but this one wasn't one of those, it was just plain stupid.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was never a fan of the original Let It Be. I was also born after the original album came out so I have absolutely no sentimental attachment to it or the Beatles.  Honestly, I don't even like the Beatles as much now as I once did.<br /><br />However, this album has really grown on me over the past 18 months that I have owned it.  I am happy that the chatter between songs has been cut out, and I always HATED the Phil Spector strings in Long and Winding Road, which up to now had been my least favorite Beatles Song.<br /><br />With its fresh remastered sound quality, this album is simply one of the best sounding Beatles records there is.  I don't care if it wasn't what the Beatles wanted, or if is different from what people remember.  The bottom line is that it is an album of great sounding music, and because of this fact, the album frequently enjoys trips in my car's CD player -- a priviledge not enjoyed by any of my other Beatles albums.
B00005JKED|4.0|Seriously, the only reason I am giving this movie a 4 is because Denzel is in it, and Denzel is the man. I really didn't like this movie because of all the big time evilness and corruption all for the sake of it. It's so terrible to see how a cop could be so corrupt and wayward, as well as the hierarchy rule in the police department and agencies, that I had to wonder if such a level of immorality could really exist. You then look at the world around you and know that this is exactly what goes on all the time. Denzel's character as a bad cop did get his in the end-meaning his \\"just deserts\\". That's all I have to say.
B0007TKH66|2.0|I just finished rewatching Firefly, and Enterprise is a real frustration in comparison.  I sort of like Enterprise.  I love Star Trek.  I'd say about 23% of the episodes in Season 1 are really interesting.  30% are almost exact copies of episodes from the other Star Trek series.  For the most part, the writing is really lazy.  The writers treated Enterprise like Voyager, which was a boring nowhere concept that they KNEW didn't work.  The ship should have been teetering on disaster, exploring the strange and beautiful.  Instead, the Enterprise crew were like stupid rednecks with no common sense meeting boring aliens.  And the Jolene Blalock T&A scenes are inexcusable and insulting.  Shame on you Berman and writing staff.  Enterprise does get really good in Season 3 and Season 4.  It's too bad the writers didn't treat the franchise like it was in trouble from the beginning.  For your money, buy Firefly and the complete Deep Space Nine series.  When Enterprise Season 3 comes out, start there.

0783225881|5.0|A truly magical movie that moved me unlike most movies. Of course, there are moments where we need to suspend logic, but isn't that what movies are about? I was amazed by some of the negative criticism of this film. I was equally amazed at people who read too much into it. It was like taking a Robert Frost poem and reading it as one would a poem by T.S. Eliot. The brutal realists will hate this movie, but those with even half a heart will be moved. There is not one false note in the entire film. Even the phrase \\" If you Build It He Will Come\\" has become a catch phrase of an entire generation. Yes, I admire this film greatly & I happily dismiss anyone who does not.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is a fantastic CD. Matt Bellamys stellar vocals deliver with emotive conviction. Definitely an album that belongs in the \\"Conjures some feeling\\" pile.  <br />Everyone seems to be mentioning the more upbeat songs as the ones deserving of praise, well the song that got me hooked beyond any other was \\"Blackout\\" this song is hauntingly beautiful, it's actually reminiscent of Jeff Buckley ala Grace.  <br />The album is consistantly excellent and highly recommended
B0007XT87G|3.0|All-in-all a somewhat boring release by PT.  PT is one of my favorite bands and contrary to other reviewers, I don't think it is anything like In Absentia.....in fact, it feels more like some of the more weaker releases from \\"up the downstairs\\" or signify\\" era, but with more up-to-date guitar distortion.  Beautiful melody is generally lacking and replaced with dry, brooding jams.  Even though I rated it average, I am rating against the 'PT standard'.....so Deadwing is worthy of attention over most music out there.
0761119752|1.0|We never got around to reading this book because my baby went right for mouthing it. A minute later I saw her face was covered in black specks of ink because the cover had started to disintegrate. The ink was really hard to get off and plenty was ingested. She mouths all of her board books and this has only happened with this one.
B00069YE0W|5.0|but everyone who does understand, will see beauty at its finest. It honestly sounds like John is singing next to you physically, while your lying on your bed staring at the roof. In a digital age, its hard to find something so pure sounding, not that every non digital albums are good (white stripes etc.), but it accompanies johns warmth feeling to curtains and compliments his acoustic style alot more.  <br /> <br />Lots of people dont understand, and really its their loss(and a big one might i add), although no one should force themselves to love it, as it was an album i have been waiting for along time personally. Im not sure what people were expecting, but really no modern pop artists portrays ideas and ambitions like John. <br /> <br />Personal highlights are the first 4 songs. Johns voice serenates raw loose melodies and think harmonies over 70's esque acoustic chords. Personally i reckon the album would of been better if it were no synths and drums, but it doesnt do much harm to have them there. <br /> <br />The only slight problem, which bothers me is that the album clocks just over half an hour. Which isnt really a problem, but im just greedy and want more! Although my favourite beach boys clock in around that time(friends,20/20, wild honey, sunflower) and its nice to drive to the city and hear the whole album through on the way.  <br /> <br /> <br />One of my favourite records that ive ever heard, and i recomend the vynal copy, as it adds to the warmth which curtains demonstrates so well. John makes his albums prely for his fans, and really as my other artist David Bowie states, \\"its the artists who dictate the future, not the critics\\", in other words, who cares if John isnt intouch with current fashions and fads in the music industry, hes still putting out better albums and purer music than most hyped bands. Im not really promoting bying the album, although i recomend a listen(download?), this is a mere tribute.
B00097DX3U|5.0|All alliteration aside, this is a remarkable album. After their first album, I had ridiculous expectations from the quartet, and to their credit they have delivered upon them.  <br /> <br />Being a massive Sundgarden fan (my favourite band), I can safely say this is an outstanding album from top to bottom by my favourite vocalist. Every song here is a masterpeice of emotion and craftsmanship, much like Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\". The band has gelled togeather remarkably well over the years, and it's quite scary to think that this is only the 2nd album; the future looks quite exciting. <br /> <br />There is a reason why I am starting to treasure and respect this album more every time I listen to it. Audioslave are the poster child for the modern progession of Rock and Roll. In our current POP dominated music marketplace, one can easily feel alienated. Remember not so long ago when you were headbanging and letting loose to some GLORIOUS rock songs? I'm talking Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins and Rage Against The Machine. We have gone from those MASTERFUL bands to now: Britney Spears and Mariah Carey ruling the airwaves.  <br /> <br />Audioslave is modern rock's saviour. So buy the CD, switch to track #2 'Out of Exile' or track #7 'The Worm' and by god man, Rock the F*** Out!!  <br /> <br />P.S I'm convinced that Tom Morello is Jimi Hendirix's bastard child. I don't believe in Reincarnation, but I just might do so in this case.
B00003CWL6|4.0|All they look for it desperately. They covet it. Find the perfect couple. A stable marriage, a family, a pretty house in a pleasant suburb. A work that offers comfort, security, luxuries and whims. A perfect life, like the stamp of a Kodak photography. The American Dream.<br /><br />And nevertheless, for Lester, Carolyn and Jane Burham, the American dream is a fraud. Meager, without sense, they can barely stand it. The Burham lead lives of calm desperation. They are frustrated, bored. Lester admits feeling like a failure. Carolyn wouldn't do it in a million years. Jane can't see the hour to go away from home.<br /><br />Routine. Emptiness. Boredom. This is the life in the Burham house, until Jane introduces her parents to Angela, her friend at school and gives Lester a bizarre reason to enjoy life again.<br /><br />Angela is transformed into the object of such strong fantasies that they turn Lester into a completely different man. A middle age crisis assaults him, scaring and scandalizing his wife and daughter. Nothing can stop him.<br /><br />Behind each door in the suburbs a volatile world exists, on the brink of madness and self-destruction. That's true or American Beauty is just an isolated case. Not likely.<br /><br />The sharp real world that the director, screenwriter and cast display on screen is as pleasant as it is irritating. Pleasant because it shows an acute observation about the American family lifestyle. Irritating because confronts honestly the hypocrisy that usually surrounds life: the modern values, often hollow, the weaknesses that make us adopt behavior patterns that are not part of our personality, the phobias, prejudices, ambitions, the insecurities that we all feel internally.<br /><br />American Beauty tells us that there is nothing no worse than being \\"ordinary\\".

0151008116|5.0|Simply brilliant.   There are so many levels to this novel I know I have yet to scratch the surface.   One one level, it is simply a remakable story about a boy stranded on a boat with a tiger.  It is interesting and engaging on that level.  However, we are forced to ask ourselves: is what we think we know what really happened? (For that matter, do we ever know what really happened?)  <br /> <br />A novel about story telling, perception and reality, spirituality, loss, coming of age, good and evil, religion and the forces of our natural world.  Let me know when you figure out the island. <br /> <br />This work is destined to be taught in classrooms some day.  I was sorry when it was over. <br /> <br />
0671891634|4.0|Peter Lynch writes well and this book has some classic wisdom that lets you into his mind.  One drawback is that Mr. Lynch may sometimes forget just how smart he is and tends to over simplify some aspects of investing analysis that come to him naturally.  For example, asking a clerk at a retail store what sells well is a technique Mr. Lynch will use on occasion to evaluate a stock.  However, it's key to note that he also has a great deal of resources in the form of advanced technology and research tools, not to mention personal genius.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended and can be a great tool for a business owner or investor but I'd caution most non-professionals on reading this and thinking they can become the next Peter Lynch with little more than a computer and a brokerage account.  Good book, thanks Mr. Lynch.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Forgettable Keanu Reeves film that could be possibly his worse movie to date. Keanu should have never gotten this role and it only shows that the people who work in Hollywood are really stupid because the role calls for someone who can give a complicate performance, something Reeves can not pull off. He comes across as a phony and his performance is possibly his worse. The script does not help him at all with bad dialog that could crack the sound barrier and a story that makes no sense what so ever.  Rachel Weisz does more with her role than he does with his and steals the movie with a tight and strait forward performance that could have been a better lead for this movie than Keanu's character. I believed in her characters plight more than the believed in what was going on in the entire film and would have liked to know more about her and her sister as well.  Too bad for her and the audience that the movie is more of a bore than a movie with substance and I would have like to have followed Weisz more than Reeves in this movie.  <br /> <br />Not worth your time.
0066620996|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a colleague I respect very much who has built a very successful large company.<br /><br />Good to Great breaks away from 99% of the anecdotal business books out there which simply detail the past actions of successful businesses or people or worse authors with no business knowledge.  Knowing what a successful business did is not nearly as useful as knowing whether what they did was the actual reason they were successful.  Collins does this only through a painstaking process that took several years and 25 researchers.  His team identified companies that had gone from being above average to stellar and then worked to identify the reasons and research it in depth.<br /><br />The end result is a very readable and easy to understand and use guide that is packed with enough solidness and backbone to please even the toughest academic.  Useable knowledge with solid reason and research backing - this is what a business book should be.
B00004Z459|4.0|Like most people these days, I find myself having a hard time finding a talented metal band. After realizing that the underground metal scence was full of greedy untalented crap like Morbid Angel, Testament, Iron Maiden, Amon Amarth, Nile, Suffocation, Death, Judas Priest, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom, and Cryptopsy. This Linkin Park band shows you that melody and heaviness can be combined in a brutal way. <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|I highly recommend this piece of rock to everybody who's a bit hopeless and tired of the degrading state of radio today. A truly enjoyable record that grows on you. First and foremost: it rocks. Period. Put the volume way up and shake your head to the riffs of the two opening tracks. You'll feel your blood pumping with the raw violence of Tom's simple and tasty guitar play, the amazing voice of Chris, those drums that never quit. Different tracks take you to different places, all of them relevant and credible. It feels refreshing and weird at the same time to hear a band that doesn't treat you like you are some stupid kid who enjoys catchy rythms and flashy choruses. Together with their amazing debut album, they make a great hard rock collection.
B000002J09|1.0|Why is it all of a sudden a big trend to listen to classic rock bands? When you can be listening to good modern music.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin (minus the booze, drugs, and satanism) are merely a group of average rockers. None of these tracks actually stand out, and this cd has not passed the test of time.<br /><br />For truly inspiring music just listen to Korn, Slipknot, Atreyu, Avenged Sevenfold, or any emo/hardcore or nu metal band out there... MTV is the place for good music.
B00097DX3U|5.0|The first album sounded like two groups getting together to jam. It was a great album. Out of Exile has the sound of a band rather than a collection of great artists. Audioslave has created their own sound with this one. High quality music here, and more than makes up for other summer power albums being weak.
B0007P3582|5.0|Rap started off with a slump back in the 80s and early 90s. America was tired of useless rappers like Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, Run DMC, 2Pac,etc... so MTV started recruiting Talented rappers such as Ludacris, Usher, Nelly, Chingy.. you know the rest. <br /> <br />50 Cent is lyrically a genius. Never has an artist had so many good songs on a single album.  He sings about life in the streets and how growing up was tough; things that matter. <br />Unlike 2pac, he doesn't have to fake his death to make sales. <br /> <br />5 Stars. NOT ENOUGH!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this cd, put it in the cd player and listened to it straight through--no skipping around--and my high expectations were completely fulfilled.<br /><br />I love music.  It's such a powerful medium.  It can take you places--back to childhood, to the hopeful places in your heart that aspire for greatness, to the quiet places inside yourself that you rarely share with others....  EMANCIPATION OF MIMI was one of those albums that has the energy of something new and also is familiar...having elements that remind you of your favorite songs; some of the tracks seem to be very present and contemporary takes on songs that otherwise would have a clearly 'old school' feel.  And I don't know if any of you feel this, but there is something under Mariah Carey's voice--an essence of gospel, if you will.  The soul and perfection of her voice can 'take you to church' even if she's performing a pop or hip-hop number:-)<br /><br />The writing, the beats, the style is brilliant.  Mariah Carey is a maestro, and she makes me love even the songs that don't feel like any others that I've ever heard.  I admire her for trying different things, not being afraid to go out on a limb artistically.  And I'm glad she's back.<br /><br />While I loved the entire album, I especially liked:  'Like This and Like That'; 'We Belong Together'; 'Get Your Number'; 'One and Only'; 'Mine Again';'Joy Ride'; and 'Fly Like A Bird'.  I'm glad Mariah is back to give us all chills with her lovely poetry and angelic voice.<br /><br />Gorgeous and Genius.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|It's about submarines and World War II.  I enjoyed it alot.  It shows some of the real story behind critical intelligence missions during World War II.
B000066744|5.0|This movie, which reeled me in with its mysterious premise- a baby found abandoned on a ship, who grows into a man who never steps a foot on land- turned out to be spectacular. <br />First off, the camera work was fabulous, the film sumptuously shot.  This isn't a movie where you bounce from frame to frame.  I love movies that take their time and explore what they've created, not zip through it once lines have been said.  Virtually every shot, every frame has an essence, a feeling, be it gaiety, romance, sadness, etc.  That alone made it a joy to watch. <br />Tim Roth was fabulous as 1900- those big, thoughtful eyes can convey such emotion.  Though some will sight this movie as being too sad, with a terrible ending, I cannot agree.  The only sadness comes from 1900's predicament- having lived his whole life on a finite ship that finally cultivated a paralyzing fear of the rest of the world.  Other complaints have their merit- the girl for whom 1900 finally tries to get off the boat has really no relationship at all with him, making it odd to take such a big step for someone he hardly knows.  Yet I like to chalk it up to her representing something to him- love, companionship, a home, and a family- even if she isn't the one, she brings up these feelings in him.  There are logical gaps in the movie- where did this baby come from?, why in the world did one of the workers get to keep it?, 1900 could just sit down as a kid and play?, did the boat never go in for repairs, in which case 1900 would have to get off?, how did 1900 manage to survive when it was so decrepit and ready to be blown up?  But the movie is mythical- after all, a legend.  The details melt away in the grander vision of things.  I cannot say that the movie will let you leave feeling good.  It could have ended with 1900 finally getting off- maybe seeing the girl from the boat again somewhere- but it wouldn't have fit. <br />The movie is just so magical.  I couldn't keep this silly grin off my face when the piano began to spin in the ballroom as the ship rocked and rolled, with 1900 playing- it was perfectly whimsical.  I cheered when 1900 won the piano duel by lighting the cigarette with the strings hot from his playing.  I loved the way he observed people and made up little songs to suit them.  I gasped to hear him say \\"F*** the regulations.\\"  These little things just stick in my head.  Watch this movie.  You won't regret it.
B000069AUI|5.0|First introduction to the band was during their outstanding performance of Politik in the 2003 Grammy Awards show. Martin's falsetto is haunting and the band's sound is very focused. The main theme/melody of each song is very clearly defined (something sorely lacking in today's music!!) and the accompanying support is always centred on making that central theme shine. Besides that they are excellent performers, which was what struck me the most when I watched them during the Grammys. I know this review is really late in coming since X & Y is due really soon. But I just wished to express my support for this phenomenal band. Coldplay, you've got a die-hard fan in me! Keep making your music!
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album definitely is great but not as good as the first. There are 3 singles on this CD which are \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Your Time Has Come\\", and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" <br />The top songs on this album are: <br />#4  Doesn't Remind Me - Probably the best to me on the album <br />#3  Be Yourself <br />#7  The Worm <br />#8  Man Or Animal <br />#10 Dandelion <br />#9 Yesterday to Tomorrow - which sounds like almost a \\"I am the Highway\\" kind of melody or \\"Like A Stone.\\" <br />Drown Me Slowly sounds so much like a Soundgarden song and Man or Aimal has the riffs of RATM totally. Overall a great album but there self titled album would be there baby. AS brings together two great bands and manages to produce some original material.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album is one of SOAD's best to date. Although I prefer Steal This Album! over this one, it still contains a nice charm that keeps it high in my book.  <br /> <br />The positives:  <br /> <br />Much more intense music. This is their heaviest album, Vocally, that they've ever had with songs like BYOB. <br /> <br />Variety of songs and messages in songs is very nice and doesnt make the album stale. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />I only have 3 qualms about this album: <br /> <br />the one slowsong/ballad isn't that good (\\"Lost in Hollywood\\")   <br /> <br />The album iss short at 36mins. Hopefully the next version will remedy this. <br /> <br />Serj takes the backseat in the lyrics and songwriting of this album. Which makes me wonder what direction the band is heading in at this point. Not to say that this is a bad thing, it is just puzzling. <br /> <br /> <br />Other than these things, GREAT album. SOAD is large and in charge. Carrying the torch that Rage Against the Machine carried so well.
B00082IJ08|1.0|If you liked the first album keep it and cherish it. Do not bother this load of garbage. I can't even use it as background music.
B000002U9W|4.0|\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is one of the more unknown Floyd albums, but without good reason. The inclusion of the horns to the music is a tremendous asset. The 24 minute long title tracks takes the listener on a sonic journey through the abyss. The first section with the horns is simply beautiful and epic. It really is too bad that the band decided to take the horns out of the foreground for the next few albums (ie: a sax in Money and in Us and Them, but little else). <br /> <br />This record is supremely trippy, with the band conjuring up strange and wonderful guitar, just listen to the middle section of the title track, choral chanting, percussive beats and and electric organ. Only Pink Floyd... <br /> <br />If is a much simpler, acoustic song that is pretty simple, especially by the standards set by the past, although the arpeggios created by the guitar are excellent. Summer '68 picks up better, with Rick Wright on vocals (sounding, strangely enough, like later Roger Waters). The piano on this song steals the show, with a pleasent chord progression. The chorus is extremely weird...has to be heard. Fat Old Sun is another acoustic song, and is better than If, in my opinion. The final track is possibly the weirdest thing Floyd has ever come up with, a soundscape of background noise with jams over top. <br /> <br />\\"Marmalade, I love marmalade\\" <br /> <br />Phychedelic indeed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anyone unsure of whether to buy the Firefly tv series should wait no longer - it's worth it.  <br /> <br />I wasn't a big fan when Firefly came out on Fox, mainly because the scheduling was erratic and the episodes were shown (as I later found out) out of order. The confusion and frustration I felt made me finally give up. I blame that entirely on Fox, because I know of Joss Whedon's storytelling skills. <br /> <br />So, after the dvd set came out, friends of mine kept telling me how crazy I was not to watch Firefly.  I remembered some interesting episodes and good acting, but just wasn't sure it was worth it to buy - especially since it was a season cut short.  <br /> <br />Well, when I saw the Serenity movie trailer and had some gift certificates to spend, I finally took the \\"chance\\" and bought it. And then I proceeded to watch episode after episode, night after night, engrossed in a great storytelling. Watching ALL the episodes in the CORRECT order really made this a fun experience. Shame on Fox for poor decision making. <br /> <br />The Firefly DVD is worth every penny. Though the series' life was cut short, hopefully the Serenity movie due out in September 2005 (along with the comic series that will hit summer 2005) should continue the adventures of the Serenity crew.  <br /> <br />You won't regret buying this series.
B000024D4R|4.0|\\"Animals\\" is perhaps Floyd's strangest album. Mostly guitar based, and lacking any real keyboard hooks, this work comes between the beautiful epic \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and the 1979 magnum opus, \\"The Wall. Seeming completely removed from the trippiness of the rest of the Pink Floyd catalog, \\"Animals\\" stands as an independant triumph.   <br /> <br />Most notable moments in the album include the charming acoustic pieces acting as bookshelves for the epics, the middle section of Dogs and the guitar work on Sheep. The lyrics of Pigs (3 Different Ones) are also to be commended.  <br /> <br />While \\"Animals\\" lacks the distinction of being my top Floyd record, it indeed holds its place in their legacy, and remains one of the lost gems in their catalog after the big 3 (Dark Side, Wish and The Wall).
B000683VI4|4.0|I would like to offer the following disclaimer before beginning this review: I am a crier. I cry at movies. Romantic movies, chick flicks, movies with happy endings, movies with sad endings...you name it, I'll have at least a few tears going by the end. That being said, only two movies have ever managed to completely reduce me to a messy, sobbing wreck: Titanic and Steel Magnolias. Well, thanks to author Nicholas Sparks and director Nick Cassavetes, I can now add The Notebook to that very short list.  <br /> <br />The general plot of The Notebook is a story as old as the hills: Rich girl (Allie, played by Rachel McAdams) meets penniless boy (Noah, played by Ryan Gosling), and they fall in love. Allie's parents don't approve, and the brief relationship ultimately ends. Years later, Allie is engaged to another man (Lon, played by James Marsden). Noah suddenly comes screaming back into her life, and she's forced to choose between two men that she loves dearly.  <br /> <br />What makes The Notebook stand apart from similar tales is the way the plot is presented. The story of Noah and Allie's love is told entirely in flashback mode-an older Noah (James Garner) reads the story to an older Allie (Gena Rowlands), who now suffers from Alzheimer's. Since Allie is no longer able to recognize Noah, much less remember the story of their teenage romance, Noah reads to her from a notebook that encapsulates the story of their love. He reads to her every day, and on \\"good days,\\" she manages to remember and come back to him for a short time.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend stocking up on tissues before you sit down to watch this film. I was unprepared the first time I watched it-I ran out of tissues and ended up sobbing into my husband's shirt instead. (He was remarkably understanding.) The story of Noah and Allie's romance-by itself-will evoke a few tears from some viewers. But the real heartbreaking stuff lies in the scenes with James Garner and Gena Rowlands. They're both brilliant actors, and their scenes together were the parts that reduced me to a sobbing mess.  <br /> <br />The DVD is packed with lots of bonus features, including two commentaries: one by author Nicholas Sparks and one by director Nick Cassavetes. Also included are documentaries on the original novel and casting and several deleted scenes.  <br /> <br />I very, very highly recommend The Notebook, as long as you take my advice: Be prepared with at least one full box of Kleenex (more if you watch with a group of people), and don't watch it alone. Have a significant other over to cry with you, or make it a girls' night in. Having a shoulder (or two or three) to cry on will make all the difference with this movie.
B0000026NC|5.0|The guy above must be joking (or he didn't listened to it all)! It's the best Pink Floyd's album I've ever heard!! All songs sounds better than on studio albums. And \\"One of these days\\"... Oh my God! This song simply kicks ass!!! After having listened to this song (from this album) I became dedicated Pink Floyd fan...
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I loved the movie!!!!!! I think that it was a whole lot better that the play.I didnt really care for the play.And pluse Gerard Butler is so hot!!! I really recomend this movie. I have watched it like 20 times and i still cry.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Only good songs. Bvbd, holiday, whatsername. thats it. buy nimrod or dookie. download the other songs. good thing sombody burnt it for me. greenday went downhill when they started getting political.
B0000009RX|5.0|It was Palmdale, 1967 or 1968. My neighbor had an original copy before Verve censored it. My best friend and I went to listen to it and the neighbor had taken a pin and scratched out all the dirty parts so his mom would not hear them. Yet, that scratchy album had a profound impact on me and hooked me on the Mothers. In the end, I collected 27 Mothers/Zappa albums and though there were some great classics, none of them compared to this one. Just as interesting are some of the back stories to the songs which I learned from the Real Frank Zappa book.<br /><br />The album has it all. Surf music, a skipping record, a blatant reference to \\"Hey Joe,\\" snorks, and of course, Jimmy Carl Black! The hippies, the phonies, the punks (not as you know them from the eighties either!), and corporate America. From what I remember of that time, he skewered the whole peace, love, dove, era and a lot of those people I knew never had a clue he was talking about them. I'll admit my exposure to real hippies was limited, so I can't say that it went over all of them! Especially when many of those \\"flower children\\" went on to be PHD's, scientists, doctors, lawyers, etc.<br /><br />This \\"re-mastered by FZ\\" release has been tampered with, so for purists, there are some differences. I noticed them but can not say for sure what they are, they are subtle, and to me, do not take away from the album. If you are a purist, you may want to look for a different version NOT re-mastered by FZ.<br /><br />There is no better way to describe the atmosphere of the times, or know the Mothers. Highly recommended.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Having given Demon Days a few listens so far, I am quite impressed, however, it seems about half the reviewers here aren't.  It appears to me that there were a lot of expectations of a follow-up that looked and felt like the original.  Well, I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but this is NOT a clone of the self-titled first Gorillaz album.  It is VERY different. <br /> <br />A greater emphasis on hip-hop and electronica than the debut album makes itself present as well as some interesting variations (Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head comes to mind).  It's different, but still recongizable as Gorillaz.  Don't fear change.  Don't fear variety.  Go in with an open mind and enjoy the ride.  It's worth it!
B00097DX3U|5.0|There are only two singers in rock n roll history that possess the voice of the gods. Mr. Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin and Mr. Chris Cornell from Soundgarden, Temple of The Dog, and now Audioslave. After falling to obsession with their first album released in 2002, I have eagerly anticpated their second. After a few songs I knew that this album would be a little different, but just as amazing as their debut. The voice of Chris Cornell, the guitars of Tom Morello, the bass of Tim Commerford, and the drums of Brad Wilk are all back and come together to make an insanely incredable sophmore album, \\"Out Of Exile\\". Brilliance-Pure-Brilliance!
0743454537|5.0|By far the best book I've read this year.   An amazing story and journey that will stir your emotions.
B0006399FS|5.0|When I first played the cd - Vertigo by that stage was well known - quick skip to Miracle Drug, not bad I thought. When Sometimes got going I thought has to be a single. By the time City of Blinding Lights finished, I couldn't go on. Too much information so I started again. This time from Vertigo right through to Yahweh. Every track is unique in its own way. My favourite right away was Sometimes, but now i've moved onto Original of the Species, absolutely their best track on the cd. I hope it is not released as a single as it should not be overplayed. Its too good. This whole cd is original and once the tour finally gets down under this will be their greatest acheivement since Joshua Tree. 10 out of 10 for me. Will be a classic in the years to come.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Don't listen to the haters this CD is absoluetly amazing. I'm liking it better than Clint Eastwood the darker tone mixed with catchy dance beats is great and most importantly it sounds different than nething else out right now and it sounds different than eastwood. The people that said they don't like it didn't really give any real reason. Guess they dont like change. If you liked the first one you should like this and its a safe buy. Unlike most other albums every song on here is great. Someone said this is uninspired, now i dont know completely what that means but im sure they dont either cus this definately sounds inspired. I think you have to be inspired to say lets have dennis hopper narrate a story in one of our songs(dont worry its good, creative, and INSPIRED). In a music industry filled with rap(not saying rap is bad(in fact i like it)just theres a lot of it), and pop singers like mariah carey(ok this is bad) and whatnot this is a much needed breath of fresh music. i reccomend you buy this album, fans and curious onlookers alike.
B00097DX3U|4.0|There is Audioslave. You had RATM and Soundgarden. Ok... simple, right? YES... though Audioslave come from seperate bands they are, without a doubt, unique in their entirety! There are similar elements from both but overall it's obvious that they are going through an evolution in attempt to try to make their own style seperate from their pasts. To really see this album for what it is you have to step back and look at Audioslave that way.  <br /> <br />Their last self-titled album was similar to Out of Exile but overall this is a pretty noticeable change from before. Their debut signaled a HARD-rock feeling with some mellow points and overall it kicked tail. Now we have Out of Exile which is the opposite--a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of HARD-rock moments and mellower/BLUESY fusion of what we saw before. It is different but kicks tail of equal magnitude! <br /> <br />The cool thing about Audioslave is they can not be lumped into any solid category because they fuse together so many elements of music. That is by far the main element which makes them stand out so much.  <br /> <br />Basically, cop the album! It's great if you're able to accept the evolution that Audioslave has followed! Real fans will love it no matter what! You still got Cornell, Morello, Wilk and Commerford. The same guys we love and that's all needed for a hot ROCK album!!!
B0000669JL|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest artists of all time. You could listen to this no mater what kind of mood your in. And if you start listening to it with a certain lady friend, then get up and start dancing alog to it with her! One of the most romantic things i ever i did!(skip over when it gets to \\"i shot the sherrif\\").  <br />Whats this about someone complaining that he took drugs?! well of curse he did you fools, he's a Rastapharian!!! its wo they do!! <br />FAV SONG ON ALBUM= \\"could this be love\\" Download this, get it, isten to it, one of the best songs ever! <br />Oh and the ratings given by the other reviewer are wrong, this song is without a doubt 11/10!!! <br />
B00080ZG10|4.0|I don't know if we'll ever see the gritty, personal Martin Scorsese that the world of American movies saw in the '70s and '80s with classics like MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, and RAGING BULL, among others. These days, Scorsese seems more interested in making epics than with expressionistically delving into characters and psyches. At least, though, he still has a sense of style that renders even relatively hollow material with a feeling of freshness, and it seems to me that style---as well as Scorsese's love for old movies and old Hollywood---is what THE AVIATOR, his most recent picture, is all about. <br /> <br />Certainly the first hour of THE AVIATOR (which runs close to 3 hours) shows Scorsese at his most energetic: the period recreations are lovingly detailed and magnificently shot (by Robert Richardson), and the restaging of the aerial dogfight sequence of HELL'S ANGELS is exhilarating. And all throughout, you get a sense that Scorsese sees something of himself in Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), at least in the near-fanatical energy and zeal he brings not only to making his films, but in making his airplanes. (There are one or two shots in which Hughes runs his fingers over the exterior of a plane in the same adoring way he runs his fingers over a woman's back.) There is a sense throughout parts of THE AVIATOR of personal involvement here that I thought was missing in GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), and it's that sense that energizes this film, especially in its first hour. <br /> <br />But wait a minute...this movie is supposed to be Howard Hughes, isn't it? Which brings me to my one major reservation about this film: as an exploration of Howard Hughes---the man who had such brief glory in the 1930s and '40s before his OCD overtook him and turned him into an equally fanatical recluse---it rarely penetrates below the surface of the alternately charming and megalomaniacal Hughes. We see him accomplish amazing things (and the first flight of his Spruce Goose is an amazing sight in this movie indeed), and we see terrible things happen to him; but never do we really get an understanding of him---a fault that I thought was also present in his much-acclaimed RAGING BULL. Scorsese seems less interested in psychology here than in surface sheen; and, as dazzling as THE AVIATOR often is on the surface, the ultimate feeling I get from the movie is of a sumptuously entertaining but hollow biopic. <br /> <br />Still, I did enjoy the movie for its energy and freshness, and for its lack of sentimentality and typical Hollywood uplift (the end of the movie finds Hughes repeating \\"The way of the future\\" over and over again in front of a bathroom mirror, a tragic symptom of his serious OCD; even in triumph, his future looks bleak). It has a few scenes that contain some truths about the cost of stardom in Hollywood (so it's not a TOTALLY empty experience, I suppose). And I did enjoy some of the performances, particularly Cate Blanchett's Oscar-winning turn as one of Hughes' many loves, Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett doesn't really look like Hepburn, and at times she sounds more like a caricature of the distinctive Hepburn voice than the Real McCoy; but she brings depth and humanity to the interpretation, and never allows it to lapse into caricature. (If she doesn't always get the details right, she certainly gets that spunky Hepburn spirit down pat.) As for Leonard DiCaprio...well, he wouldn't have been my choice for Howard Hughes, and certainly his boyish voice doesn't really suggest the kind of authority to it that would have made people like his accountant Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) hang on loyally with him despite constantly questioning his judgment (or his sanity). But DiCaprio does convincingly convey his passion and megalomania; and, on small occasions, he does show flashes of the same charm he brought to parts of his great performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Steven Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. (DiCaprio is undoubtedly a fine actor, but I thought he did a better job carrying CATCH ME IF YOU CAN than he does here.) <br /> <br />All in all, THE AVIATOR is a mixed bag: you won't learn much more about Howard Hughes than the fact that he made two or three controversial Hollywood movies, had a fixation on aviation and women, and had a serious fear of germs. In spite of its hollow center, THE AVIATOR is a stylish and entertaining epic about director Martin Scorsese's love of Hollywood's golden years. Sheer energy level and visual beauty will carry you along its 170-minute length. (And, personally, I'd take this over the overrated MILLION DOLLAR BABY anyday.) Recommended.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This album is better than I expected. I did in fact, expect to here much of the same from the first album, but you get the sense that Audioslave has meshed even better on \\"Out of Exile\\". The group combines the best of both former bands, Soundgarden and RATM. Cornell is at his best sounding much like the singer on \\"Superunknown\\". Morello and Co. are at their classic best, beating out vibes for the album. What is great about the album is how rounded it actually sounds....it doesnt sound like two separate bands trying to make a record together (like the first Audioslave effort). All in all, if you are fan of 90's hard rock...this is an album for you! <br />
0375507256|4.0|The first chapter is the journal of a mapmaker in the South Seas, in the clutches of a quack doctor who invents a brain disease and feeds him narcotics.  That ends abruptly - mid-sentence - and we find (eventually) the journal was being read by a young, brash, penniless composer in Belgium in the early twentieth century.  But only about half the journal has survived; thus the sudden ending.  Now we are reading letters this composer is writing to a good friend in England, until we discover the letters are actually being read by an investigative journalist; the dead man who tipped her off was their recipient.  We follow her adventures to uncover the truth, until her car plunges off a bridge and we discover we are actually reading the first proofs of a novel, in the hands of a loony small-time publisher, who is himself running from creditors and manages to get himself incarcerated in a nursing home.  We laugh at his attempts to escape, until we realize we're actually watching a movie, sometime in the future, in the company of a liberated clone and an underground rebel.  We hear this clone's story of liberation, in question and answer format, and it's pretty clear we are listening in on an interview - the only question is who is listening with us.   Turns out it is a post-civilization Hawaiian, who saw the interview when an anthropologist of sorts brought the player with her from a slightly-more-civilized place.  He watched the first half incognito but was interrupted, but now on his deathbed, after telling the story of his life, he'd like to see the rest.  So we watch the rest.  And the clone, just before her execution, asks to finish the movie she was watching before she was on the lam.  And the small-time publisher, once he escapes the nursing home, finds the novel writer, reads the rest of the story, and publishes it.   And the investigative journalist, once her case is cracked, comes across the rest of the letters between her tip-off and his longtime friend, the composer.  Who finds the rest of the  maritime journal under a bed.   And we are back where we started.  Sort of.   <br /> <br />The effect is that, at least through the first half, you feel like you're reading a collection of short stories.   Probably Mitchell's greatest achievement is his ability to really inhabit the widely varying styles of different stories - each one feels completely different, not just in plot, place, time period, but in style, like a new author is taking over.    <br /> <br />There is a recurring bit about a comet-shaped birthmark and de ja v,  leaving you to draw your own conclusions about reincarnation/past lives etc,  though I don't know quite how this would work and the stories are varying levels of fiction and reality.   This theme seems superficial and extraneous to me, and I don't think the book would lose much if it lost it.   <br />  <br />The real theme running through the book is about power, oppression, and rebellion -  in every story, the main character, in one way or another, overcomes an oppressive system, be it a nursing home or a vast technocratic totalitarian government.  Mitchell indulges himself on the last page, allowing his character to wax philosophical and express his themes directly.   I was going to copy that passage out for this review, but the book was due back at the library.   So you'll have to read it for yourself.
B000002H70|5.0|What can I say about \\"Disintegration\\" that hasn't already been said repeatedly?  Yes, like others, it's, by far, my favorite album by my favorite band (\\"Faith\\" would be second).  The sheer length of the album, as well as most of the songs, can appear daunting, until you start listening to the complex textures and riveting lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Disintegration\\" begins with \\"Plainsong\\" with those tinkling wind chimes followed by a burst of sound: \\"You said 'and it's so cold it's like the cold if you were dead' and then you smiled for a second.\\"  The usually glum Robert Smith is telling us things aren't always that bad.  \\"Pictures of You,\\" about longing for a former lover, and expressing the anger of loss by destroying photographs of her, is universally considered to be one of the band's great songs, of which I wholeheartedly agree.  As usual, Simon Gallup stands out on bass (this is also, with \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me,\\" The Cure's greatest album instrumentally). <br /> <br />The opposing sentiments of joy and despair stand out on two of the next three tracks \\"Closedown\\" and \\"Last Dance,\\" which sandwich one of The Cure's most recognisable songs, the bittersweet \\"Lovesong,\\" which, though commercially oriented, is still one of my favorite Cure songs.  \\"Lullaby\\" can be straight out of \\"Grimm's Fairy Tales\\" but, quite frankly, this is one song I can skip, although it seems to be a fan favorite when they perform it in concert.  For some reason, \\"Fascination Street\\" reminds me of the French Quarter in New Orleans (\\"Oh it's opening time down on fascination street\\"), but I really don't have a clue as to what the song is about, and I don't care, because,with its driving unique sound it is yet another one of my favorites. <br /> <br />\\"Prayers for Rain\\" grips the listener in an extraordinary way, and the lyrics are incredibily compelling (\\"I deteriorate, I live in dirt\\") about someone who is praying for rain as a metaphor for redemption.  \\"The Same Deep Water as You\\" places one in a meditative state, again, in which Smith uses the symbolism of water in a powerful and meaningful way.  The meditative mood lasts right through \\"Disintegration\\" and \\"Homesick,\\" with melancholy setting in, until the closing track \\"Untitled,\\" which, despite its rather bleak lyrics (\\"I'll never lose this pain, never dream of you again\\"), nevertheless, conveys a sense of hope and peace.  In fact, if one can come up with a simple \\"theme\\" of \\"Disintegration\\" it would have to be the feeling of lost love.  But how eloquently Smith and Co. express this sentiment! <br /> <br />Footnote:  Since my above title for this review indicates that this would be one of ten (rock) albums I would bring to a desert island, I though I would list the others.  I am not including any greatest hits compilations, boxed sets or live albums, which I think is cheating.  They're in no particular order, and please, no fighting! <br /> <br />1.  Disintegration - The Cure <br />2.  Born to Run - Bruce Springsteen <br />3.  Who's Next - The Who <br />4.  To Our Children's Children's Children - The Moody Blues <br />5.  Beggars Banquet - The Rolling Stones <br />6.  The Stone Roses - The Stone Roses <br />7.  In the Court of The Crimson King - King Crimson <br />8.  The Joshua Tree - U2 <br />9.  Loveless - My Bloody Valentine <br />10. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway - Genesis <br /> <br />I hope I didn't offend anyone by the above list, and remember, it's just one humble person's opinion! <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|This one WILL be in my cd player for a good couple of weeks. I really can't complain about this cd, except that Morello's solos are a bit eccentric and over the top. Sometimes I wish Morello would just do some sick guitar/fingering work and not worry so much about his effect pedals and crazy sounds (my wish comes true on \\"Dandelion\\"...it fits perfectly) <br /> <br />Favorites on the album so far: <br />Drown me slowly (solo starts out like Rage's \\"Bulls on Parade\\") <br />Man or Animal <br />#1 Zero <br />The Worm <br />Your Time Has Come (2nd Single) <br /> <br />Of course those are really the ones that make ur head bang...everything else on the cd is definitely good...with the exception of \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" which is decent but I'm not really feeling it.  <br /> <br />Anyways, I definitely recommend it for Audioslave fans because it's more of the same great stuff from them, but also to people who've never really heard any of their music. Any person who can truly appreciate rock music will like this cd.
B000001FZK|5.0|Formed in the U.K. in 1981.....Talk Talk have seeked out their own increasingly individualistic path of music.  With a sound and structure that would encompass 'New Wave', 'Post-Rock', 'Jazz', 'Classical'...(and later on) 'Ambient'. Theirs is a sound that centres around the fractured vocal dynamics of vocalist \\"Mark Hollis\\", and with each album becoming more increasingly harder to catergorise & define.  Which centered around largely uncategorizable sound informed, by pieces of various downtempo genres reworked and composed to fit within their increasingly selective musical sensibilities, and seemingly committed to making huge musical (and artistic) strides with each successive album. <br /> <br />Although probably best known for their U.K. hit single \\"Life's What you Make it\\", which was a gloriously uplifting piece of sophisticated reflective experimental/Post-Rock.  The album \\"Laughing stock\\" instead takes off from where the equally breath-taking \\"Spirit of Eden\\" finished, with elegant, organic and engaging electronics, fleshed out tunes of simply beautiful understated grace and mood.  Here things are taken a step further...comprising of Six distinct parts, each is arguably a stand-out in their own right.  \\"Myrrhman\\" is a song with the barest sketches of ambient instruments, and compositions of equal parts minimalist guitar & piano.  With Mark Hollis adding fractures of vocals over the top, in the subtlest way possible....its cerebral without seeming pretentious, moving without feeling forced, and a statement of artistic endeavour over commercial appeal. <br /> <br /> \\"Ascension Day\\", is considerably more uptempo...with more layers of percussion and lingering guitar riff, punctuated by strings and horns, and after listening to it's fusion of guitar feedback & detached vocals matched with a haunting hypnotic sound, belie a level of of complexity and immense beauty, and it becomes quickly clear that the band are stretching for something far beyond conventional pop/rock themes and entering into a more spiritual realm, even if that means sacrificing mainstream appeal, in favour of something more substantial.  <br /> <br />\\"New Grass\\", like the rest of the tracks on this album, is mostly a feature long improvised section, with delicately balanced ambient flourshies with each part of the track delicately unfolding subtly and fitting perfectly into the dreamlike mood of the rest of the album, and feel like evolving soundscapes, constantly pushing the boundaries of atmospheric music, & instrumentation, to a level only previously felt on \\"Spirit of Eden\\", and thus managing to make all the elements combine, to produce something of a truly breath-taking introspective elegance.   <br /> <br />For an album that was generally ignored by the record-buying public, it's probably not too hard to see why this was passed over.  It landed at a time, when British music was firmly enthralled with both Pop & Rock music in the more conventional sense, and so the lilting, delicate and softly-focused performances of this quietly elegant album, must have been seen as hugely out of step with what was currently being produced. But just because it was ignored then, doesn't mean that you should ignore it now.  If you are reading this review, then you are almost certainly strongly recommended to pick this album up.  It shows an air of grace, bittersweet and passionate subtlety rarely seen in the music, around the time this was released (or indeed since), and one that unfortunately relegated the band to the margins of being a cult act, that was no longer a viable commercial prospect.  Its a album that if far too subtle for mass market appeal, but those that are prepared to take the leap, will be rewarded with a creatively and artistically stunning album.  Extremely recommended.
B000274THQ|4.0|I saw this movie in its German DVD version, and it's a good bitter-sweet film. Not an all-time great film, but a very good one. Daniel Brhl does his usual fine work in the role of Alex, and the rest of the cast is also above-average, particularly Katrin Sass as his mother. It's 1989. Alex and his single, divorced mom Christine live in a tiny apartment in East Berlin. Shortly before the Berlin Wall falls and East Germany becomes history, Alex's mother, a dedicated party activist and DDR supporter, has a heart attack and falls into a coma - and misses the triumph of capitalism. Eight months later, her miraculous awakening and recovery present Alex with a dilemma: How to protect his mother's weakened heart from the shock of Coca-Cola, Burger King, Audis and Mercedes. His efforts to protect her arise partly out of guilt. After all, his loyal communist mother collapsed after seeing him participating in an anti - DDR demonstration. But he quickly discovers that his plan to protect mom by creating an artificial \\"DDR\\" within their small apartment faces huge obstacles. One of them is a huge Coca-Cola banner hanging within sight of their apartment window. Another is where to find all the old East German products that vanished within months of the demise of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik. His efforts to keep all the historical changes from his mother are both funny and poignant. In the process, Alex reinvents history and creates an entirely new version of what happened while his mother was in a coma. One of the funnier tricks Alex uses to do this is a fake TV news broadcast. <br />

B0000039QA|5.0|No, I'm not talking about jewelry. This album went DIAMONDS. For those of you who don't know what that means. A gold album is 500,000 sales, platinum is 1,000,000, DIAMONDS is 10,000,000 sales. Thats over ten million of these albums sold. <br /> <br />What can I write bad about this album? Until I sell 11 million of ANYTHING, all I can have is good words about this album. Biggie was the best rapper in my opnion of all time. I wonder what would be going on right now if he was alive. The songs that he would have made, the records he would have broke.  <br /> <br />I'm only writing reviews on the best of the best. <br /> <br />One of the GREATEST ALBUMS EVER... and I'm not just talking about hip hop/rap albums... I'm talking about ALL genres.  <br /> <br />1 OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.  <br /> <br />...oh yea, did I say it went Diamonds? Until you sell 10 million of ANYTHING, don't EVER write anything bad about this album.
B00097DX3U|4.0|When Rage Split is was quite sad, and When Soundgarden called it quit nearly 8 years ago i was heart broken. this is whyAudioslave is a project i've been following for at least 5 years now. Ever since it was a rumor that Cornell and the insturmental members of Rage were jamming together. Ever since they were know and \\"Civilian.\\" Ever since the \\"break up\\" and re-birth of Audioslave. I've seen them twice and was eagerly anticipating a new album.<br /><br />Then Earlier this year I heard Be Yourself and was less then amazed. It was decent but nothing amazing. BUT I must tell you all that every other song on this album makes up for it. Every member makes their best effort in a long time. Morello's solos are back to the DJ esque RATM greatness. Tim's bassline are as driving and funkey as they were on Evil Empire. Brad is as solid as he was on Battle. and Chris Cornell's vocals are reminiciant of Superunknown and even his solo release, Euphoria Morning.<br /><br />The songs are a lot more rocking but at the same time more melodic. I think Audioslave is becoming more then a Supergroup, and are well on the way to becoming a really important Rock and Roll band.
0833509454|5.0|I've read IT about 6 times. The first time I read it I was only 11, and to be honest, though I enjoyed IT in general, I didn't understand a lot of it (I was actually looking up the dirty words I didn't understand in the dictionary and wondering why they weren't there!). I was morbidly fascinated and afraid by the horror and the sex scenes; confused by the Derry Interludes. Weirdly enough though, I love the book today at 24 for the same reasons I loved it at 11: IT is a fantastic and intricately layered story with characters that you miss when the book is over, because you've been with them through their whole story as children and adults, best friends. IT leaves you emotional, wanting more, especially of the summer of '58.<br />I'm not sure what I thought about the ending. I agree that perhaps it was a bit anticlimactic. But when I think about it, what else could have been done? I'm not talking about the \\"Beverly & the boys\\" scene. Even I thought that to be unnecessary and very unbelievable. I was 11 when I first read the book and I found this part extremely weird and shocking. Other than that, I guess the kill had to be anticlimactic; King sort of wrote himself into a corner there. But I forgive the ending for the rest of the book.<br />To those who think that the book needed \\"slimming\\" a few hundred pages, I don't get it! I believe that every element of the story was essential to build a history of Derry, identifying with the book's characters (there were 7 after all). People don't seem to have any patience anymore. I don't see the book as sloppy. I don't see extra chapters as a \\"waste of time\\" if they're adding to the book.<br />I didn't want to mention the movie here, I saw it when I was little and it's sort of a kitch classic for my friends and I, and Tim Curry was great. But why did adult Bill have to have that stupid ponytail????? haha.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Not much can be said about this album that hasn't already been said. Thus, I will try to write this review without sounding cliche. But mind you, if you've already read reviews for this album, then you already know how great it is, so what are you reading my review for?<br /><br />Slayer weren't the first thrash-metal band to ever exist (that credit goes to Motorhead, Metal Church and Metallica), but they might as well have been. Tom Araya, Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, and Dave Lombardo are the godfathers of thrash and extreme metal; they are to thrash as Bob Marley is to reggae and Ministry is to industrial. Slayer almost single-handedly popularized the genre and set the standard for what it should be like. Slayer is as important to heavy metal as any other band, and \\"Reign in Blood\\" is equally as influential and innovative as Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" and Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\"<br /><br />Even though Slayer didn't give birth to thrash-metal, I do think their 1983 debut \\"Show No Mercy\\" popularized extreme/death metal. The bands Venom (a Slayer influence) and Death came along before Slayer, but I think of Venom as black metal, not extreme; and I believe Death are only thought of as the creators of death metal because of their name. The fact is, (at the time) nobody made music as fast, heavy, and extreme as Slayer. Slayer are the inspiration for (probably) 90% of all speed/thrash/death/extreme metal bands, including two other influential death metal bands from the 1980's, Sepultura and Morbid Angel.<br /><br />No one does what Slayer do better than them, and this album proves it. Everything about \\"Reign in Blood\\" screams that this album is a pure, unadulterated masterpiece that has definitely withstood the test of time. It is full to the brim with explosive, rocket fast beats and tempos, propulsive riffs that fly by like lightning, scorching solos, insane drum work, and eerie, tortured screams. And it never lets up. Throughout these eleven tracks (or twelve, if you buy the remastered version) and 28 minutes of music, the massive onslaught only slows down for a few seconds, before picking up where it left off.<br /><br />Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman won't go down as the all time best guitar soloists, but they do play precise guitar riffs at a speed that makes other guitarists want to chop their hands off in frustration. And, their solos may not be much more than a bunch of random notes played as fast as possible, but I've never heard solos that are as wild or blistering as Kerry King's. Furthermore, Dave Lombardo's drum work and Tom Araya's vocals are also super fast. With guitar riffs this fast, Dave and Tom sometimes fall behind, and have to play \\"catch up.\\" The drum work is (obviously) very talented and Tom's words are so speedy, they sometimes sound like gibberish.<br /><br />Since almost every second of every song is as fast as the one before it (and this album has only one tempo and mood), it is sometimes difficult to discern where one track ends and another begins. You're just not metal if you don't know the song \\"Angel of Death.\\" As an album opener, it sets the bar high, and is also a good representation of the album as a whole. Slayer waste no time getting to the good stuff: \\"Angel of Death\\" shoots out of the starting gate; within three seconds, Slayer are waist-deep in blindingly fast riffs. This riff remains throughout the song, and five (count `em, five!) blistering, trademark guitar solos are also included. This song has brutal lyrics (which are about the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, and Dr. Mengele torturing and killing Jews in a variety of ways) and fitting, equally as brutal music.\\"Necrophobic\\" begins as fast as any other song on here, but it gradually slows down. It does pick up where it left off, however, before two wild solos.\\"Jesus Saves\\" seems like a continuation of track four, \\"Altar of Sacrafice.\\" It starts out fast, and from there it only gets faster (ending with a rocket fast beatand riffs). Similarly, \\"Raining Blood\\" has fast chugging riffs, then a tempo change kicks in and makes the riffs even faster. The drums on this song give the beat a \\"boom boom\\" sound.<br /><br />With so much hype surrounding it, I, initially, didn't like \\"Reign in Blood\\" as much as everyone else. Luckily, it took me only a little bit of time to believe the hype about this C.D. and become addicted to it. I am so addicted to it, it has become worn out (the bottom has been worn off, because I almost always press the PLAY button again when the C.D. is over). Even if you don't like this C.D., or don't like this type of music, you should still give Slayer props for making an album that's as fast, extreme, and influential as this one.<br /><br />In conclusion, (as aforementioned) there isn't much that can be said about this C.D. that hasn't already been said, because metalheads all around the world know how great it is. \\"RiB\\" is simply a standard-setting and genre defining album. If there ever was a landmark/milestone album, this is it. Oh, and in case I forgot to mention...\\"Reign in Blood\\" is also, hands down, the finest thrash-metal album to ever be known to man. (Note, however, that I consider Sepultura's \\"Beneath the Remains\\" to be death metal.) The bottom line is no heavy metal collection is complete without this C.D. If you're a metalhead, you should already own this C.D. (and you should have listened to it at least a dozen times by now). And if you're new to metal, you definitely need to make this one of your next purchases.

0789723107|5.0|I have a couple webdesign-related books here at work, and this is the only one I come back to from time to time. It's very well designed and laid out, has plenty of illustrations and humorous cartoons, and just like the title says, you can breeze through this thing and soak it up without really even trying. <br /> <br />This book isn't a nuts-n-bolts kind of thing, with code illustrations or or tooltips or any of that low-level stuff. No CSS, HTML, scripting, architecture tips are in this book.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This two Disk DVD Set is extraordinary. The Picture and Sound quality are so very good that you feel as though you are watching it in a theater. Because it's a widescreen picture the closed captioning doesn't interfere with the picture. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus special features. Everything you ever wanted to know about First Contact and weren't afraid to be told. Let's not forget what a wonderful job Jonathan Frakes did directing. He truly proved himself a more than qualified director for feature films. We all know what a great job he did behind the cameras on the T.V. show. My boyfriend and I watched it together and he was really impressed. He asked me how much it cost. When I told him how inexpensive it was he bought two copies. One for a gift to another Treky fan. I highly recommend this two disk set and suggest you buy it right away before they run out. If you're not satisfied with it, I'll pay you for it. That's how much confidence I have that you'll absolutely LOVE it. Believe me when I tell you this is one purchase that you will never regret. ORDER NOW!!! In response to your comment first of all thank you for reading my review and please feel free to check them all out. You are correct I didn't leave enough information on my personal feelings. I thought the film was terrific. It lived up to the quality that we are used to getting when we see anything that starts out with the heading Star Trek. The storyline was very entertaining, it was as usual well acted, written, directed, great effects. I agree I could have done a better job on the body of the review itself. I'm busy writing another review as we speak. Thank you for taking the time to read my comments and I will strive to do better in the future!
0689835604|5.0|These books by Karen Katz are wonderful. My daughter recevied these books from my mother when she was 8 months, she is now 11 months and i must tell you that this book remains her favorite thing to play with. She kisses all the babies in the book. My mother actually purchased Karen Katz's books as a set it came with Where Is Baby's Mommy?, Where Is Baby's Bellybutton, and Toes, Ears, and Nose. My daughter just loves lifting the flaps and has learned where her tongue, nose, eyes, ears, etc... are thanks to these great books! I assure you that your child will just love this book!

B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorillaz is probably the greatest band producing music right now. No, scratch that-they are the greatest band producing music right now. A pity most people won't 'get' it. The band is the brainchild of Damon Albarn (from Blur) and cartoonist Jamie Hewlett.  That's right CARTOONIST! Why cartoonist? Because Gorillaz is a fictional cartoon band! The idea is so ironic, so fit for the times...it's genius. Think Ms. Spears and Backstreet Boys are manufactured? Ha! Gorillaz is the ultimate manufactured band (they don't even exist!). Okay, cartooning aside (the music videos are awesome, imagine Western animation meeting Japanese anime mereged seamlessly with GCI graphics) lets focus on the music.<br /><br />What makes Gorillaz so incredible is the music.  The range this band has in amazing!! This is album is: a rock record, a hip hop record, a dance record, a punk record, and a techno record rolled into one. Not to mention the Spanish speaking, world beat track. The lyrics, while at once catchy and strange ('she turned my Dad on/she turned my Dad on/ She made me kill myself') are appropriate and unique. But that's not the main event here, Gorillaz music is where you'll find yourself floored. The sound is both High-Fi extemely polished on some tracks, and on others girtty and almost Lo-Fi. I've never heard a more textured record in my entire life. From the brutally sharp trumpets on \\"Latin Simone\\" to the electro regaee of \\"Dracula.\\"<br /><br />There are so many near 'magic' moments for me on this record.  The killer chorus and awesome rap of the smash single \\"Clint Eastwood\\" is one. The blistering turntable scratch on \\"Sound Check\\" is another. The ultra creepy \\"M1 A1\\" with it's frightening build up and awesome guitar/drum work is another. Which brings me to another wonderful aspect of this ablum: mood.  Never have I heard such a moody album. Certain tracks are bright and sunny (\\"19-2000\\" and \\"Rock the House\\") while others are dreary and/or downright scary (\\"M1 A1\\" and \\"New Genius\\"). It's this amazing diversity and genre bending, borrowing, and splicing that makes this record such a huge hit on an artistic level (which of course spilled over into the realm of the commercially successful).<br /><br />The only downside to this band is that as cartoons the ability to tour/perform live is somewhat limited.  The only downside to this record is that it ends. Gorillaz rule!\\"New Genius\\").

B00097DX3U|4.0|Ok, Ok, Ok, I know... I can already, and have already, heard and read the critisms of Out of Exile. With that aside, with all expectations aside, and without any pretense this is one damn fine rock album! Listen to MTV and radio these days, then listen again. Forget about what you wanted to hear, forget about what you thought you would hear, and just listen. I am a very critical music enhusiest, I have been playing myself for over 10 years, I am an obsessively huge Soundgarden fan, and love RATM, this album to me sounds like they are having the most fun that all inclusively have had musically in countless years; and not at the listeners expense. They still have the elements that made Audioslave album #1 so damn rockin, but they have added some flavor and experimentation that deserves more than just a few listens to appreciate. I had so much expectations for this album, but it's been my experience that what I expect and what a band does are two different things. I (you) had to let go of any expectations from second 00:01, as a true fan I try to go in with an empty slate, and just try to experience the album. After about 5 listens, I can say that I am in no way disappointed. 12 more songs from one of the only commercially succesful rock bands that is making new and true rock, what the f**k more can you ask for? I say thank god there is still real rock in mainstream, f**k your elitist musical views (of which I have a'plenty) and just god damn bang your head in the name of ROCK...BEeATCH!!
0140072187|5.0|Bob tells an amazing story that keeps you pinned to the book. This was my first vietnam read ten years ago & from reading Chickenhawk it brought on an interest to read many more of the same theme. This was though, by far my favourite. I remember finishing the book the first time & it leaving a hollow feeling in my stomach. I think the last line in the book sums up what Mr Mason went through. As to the start of the book, you feel you could jump into a helicopter & fly yourself. To summarise.... Absolutely Fantastic, a must read even if this isn't in your catagory.
0783226845|5.0|A retired Army veteran and a young prep-school student meet at the crossroads of their lives during the Thanksgiving holiday.  Al Pacino is Army Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, medically retired for blindness, who tows a reluctant Charlie Sims, actor Chris O'Donnell, to New York for a holiday bash.  While it starts out as \\"Real Life 101\\" for Charlie at the hands of the abrasive and experienced Frank who has been around the world three or four times, magic begins to happen as both get to know each other.      Charlie faces possible expulsion from his school for disciplinary reasons, and Frank is tired of living as a recluse at his daughter's home.  The two meet when Charlie takes a job to look after Frank while his daughter is away for the holiday.  Frank has a grand plan to enjoy the fruits of life he has missed for years and their trip to New York exposes the innocent Charlie to some bold adventure regarding women, politics, war, liquor and Ferraris.  While Charlie's eyes are opened by Frank's candor about life, he also learns that Frank has lived in pain for several reasons and it's about to get the best of him.      The real magic occurs as Charlie's discipline issue, awaiting his return from the holiday, resurrects Frank's Army officer instincts and it is this that affects major changes for both men in the coming days.  While there is a lot of humor and great moments, there are some dramatic scenes to stir your emotions.  The spontaneous tango between Frank and a young woman at a New York restaurant will melt women's hearts and Frank's rise to help Charlie delivers one of the best scenes in cinema history.
B0000029GA|5.0|To be honest, the first Nas song I've ever heard was \\"Got Yourself A Gun.\\" That's when I really started to get in to Nas a lot. Then after I heard \\"One Mic\\" I was hooked. Then he released 'God's Son' which to me is one of Nas' weakest albums. But then somebody told me about his old stuff he released prior to 'Stillmatic.' The first album I got was 'Illmatic' which in my opinion is the greatest rap album of all time. <br /> <br />The album starts off with a little intro, \\"The Genesis,\\" where you can hear a little of Nas' verse from Live At The Barbeque. Then it rolls in to the track called \\"New York State Of Mind\\" which was produced my DJ Premier. Nas dropped nothing but fire on this track, it was crazy. After the song was over I almost wanted to listen to the song again but I let it go in to \\"Life's A B****.\\" On this track you can hear Nas' father Olu Dara playing his trumpet in the background and AZ is the guest appearance. AZ's verse amazed me so much I had to listen to it again. Nas' verse was just as good on the track too. \\"The World Is Yours\\" is another hot song where Nas drops some sick lyrics that'll amaze you, even non rap fans. This is the song Jay-Z gets the sample for \\"Dead Presidents\\" off his 'Reasonable Doubt' album. \\"Halftime\\" is the next good song on the album. Nas again drops nothing but fire on this track. Then comes one of my favorites \\"Memory Lane.\\" Nas drops well thought out rhymes on every verse on this album. On this track Nas takes us back in time a little and talks about his past. Then the song to the incarcerated Cormega called \\"One Love.\\" Nas basically writes Cormega a letter telling him everythings going to be alright and you'll be out soon so don't worry. He also fills Cormega in on what's been going on lately since he's been gone. \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\" is another banging track. Nas' rhyming scheme on this one is crazy, he just rips it like it's nothing. \\"Represent,\\" the song for the block to jam to. Then the album closes out with \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell.\\" This is a perfect way to end the album. He's basically saying after you've heard this album it ain't hard to tell that I'm the best in the game right now. <br /> <br />I gave this album a 5/5 rating because it is hot from start to finish. I will admit all albums have some sort of weakness to it so I'm going to tell you. The production isn't that great, the album is pretty short(10 tracks), and most of the choruses are plain and boring. But as far as the lyrics go, I would give those a 10/5 if I could. The lyrics make up for the other weaknesses to this album. I would suggest this album to any rap fan, it's definitely worth your money. If you're a real rap fan and you don't have this album then there's something wrong with you. That's real talk, I'm not lying.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|As Matt Stone said himself - \\"I hate conservatives. But I really fu*king hate liberals.\\" Parker is of the same ilk. Surprisingly, this film is quite apolitical. If you're a conservative, you'll probably hate it. If you're a liberal, you'll probably really fu*king hate it. But if you're among that blessed throng that can't abide the self-righteous blather of either side - you'll love this film. Seeing the movie in theaters twice, the first time on opening night, it was truly gratifying to see the massive number of liberal hipsters thoroughly waylaid by the film's content. When Michael Moore exploded, I was one of only three or four people that applauded loudly. The rest of the audience was in a sort of stunned silence. The new, younger right of center folks, who have little regard for church, but even less regard for the frenzied-religious-like orthodoxy of the left will love this film. For some that see this as an implicit jab at W. Bush - you are wrong. Parker and Stone have never implied anything. They are quite obvious with their contempt. That is why Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, Janine Garafalo and others make an actual appearance in the film and George Bush does not. (Garafalo apparently cried upon learning she had been lampooned and shot in the face in the Team America - one of the most visceral and violent, immediate and pleasant death scenes in modern cinema) Stone and Parker are certainly no fans of Bush...but they \\"really fu*king {seem} to hate\\" those that appear in the film, if only when they change shape from actor to activist. In the Team America cosmos it is obvious Parker and Stone are not Pu**ies, or A**holes. They're dicks. And their movie is a rare kind of thing in today's Hollywood.
B00008977N|2.0|I'm not sure whether the person who says \\"disregard negative reviews\\" is doing anyone a favour - because a lot of what's been said to date here about the poor video is negative but very accurate.  I love Peter Gabriel - I have all his albums and had this DVD on VHS previously.  I bought this DVD along with Growing Up in the weekend.  Growing Up is superb video quality whereas Secret World Live is the worst and grainest music DVD I've ever seen.  I have a very good quality TV set and hundreds of music DVDs so my comments are most certainly not to do with equipment or operator error.  The sound quality is superb though and as a result you can tolerate the bad video for the amazing sound.  It rocks in DTS!  Its sad that such poor video quality (and one which boasts of being remastered!) is out there and I'm sure the artist himself did not know about this before it was released.

B0000508U6|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  I can feel the words, the notes, the music.  Their music carries so much emotion.  I especially love the song Don't Panic.  It's beautiful.  Trouble, Yellow and Everything's Not Lost are three more emotional, inspiring songs.  Go Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is perhaps one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, and I am far from one to exaggerate. It is lush and sumptuous, with breathtaking orchestrations and vocals. I was blown away by the sheer talent of the entire cast, especially the leads. Emmy Rossum gives the perfect performance; her Christine is just how she should be innocent and naive, beautiful and talented. As Carlotta asks right before Prima Donna, \\"Would you not rather have your precious little ingnue?\\" and the answer is, yes, we would. What Gerard Buttler lacks in vocal training and experience (though the range and power of his voice is impressive), he makes up in the sheer ability to emote so beautifully in every word he sings. As his heart breaks, yours breaks with him, and at times you sympathize with his Phantom. Patrick Wilson is a wonderful Raoul with the essential amounts of charm, sophistication, and heroism. From what I've heard he took a character that is usually not liked and made him loved. Minnie Driver as Carlotta steals every scene she is in, even though she does not sing, she is hugely enjoyable. <br /> <br />The music alone is reason enough to buy this DVD, because accompanied with the visuals (the sets are stunning, perfect for a movie based on a stage musical, there is the perfect flare of theatrics to them) of the movie, the music is even better. The spectacular orchestration are breathtaking, especially when you hear the overture for the first time, you will be floored. The songs themselves are at times exciting and enjoyable, romantic and loving, and heartbreaking and sad, a wonderful range. Particular favorites of mine are \\"All I Ask of You\\" sung by Raoul and Christine, a beautiful love song, perhaps my favorite of any musical love songs; \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is a haunting song sung by Christine about her father, I defy anyone who has lost someone to not be affected by this song; finally \\"The Point of No Return\\" is not only Gerard Butler's best performance vocally in the movie, but it is a stirring and powerful song preparing us for the movie's spectacular (and heartbreaking) conclusion. <br /> <br />I was so moved by this film that the day after I saw it, I went out and bought the soundtrack and this Special Edition DVD. Do yourselves a favor and follow in my footsteps, you won't regret it. I recommend that you by this special edition, because it is only a few dollars more, and comes with two wonderful hour long documentaries about the origins of the stage musical and the making of the movie. There is also a deleted scene featuring the original version of \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" (sung by Minnie Driver on the soundtrack) called \\"No One Would Listen\\" sung by the Phantom. I wish that they had kept it in the film. Finally, if you keep scrolling down on the menu, you will find a highly enjoyable Easter Egg. <br /> <br />Buy this, I've been disappointed when people have over-hyped films for me, but I can't say enough about this film. It is moving, riveting, and beautiful.
B0001ADB8C|4.0|It's great to see George's Dark Horse work spotlighted, and the sound quality is excellent. I, too, would have preferred a DVD with all of George's videos, but the DVD with this set is a nice one.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there's no getting away from the feeling that this set shortchanges the buyer, even those who are not fanatics who \\"must have everything.\\" There simply are too many tracks missing, including \\"Flying Hour,\\" \\"Lay His Head,\\" and \\"Sat Singing,\\" which were inexplicably dumped from the \\"Somewhere In England\\" album, but are among George's best solo work. There are others that should have been here too, including the \\"Best Of Dark Horse\\" CD, but others have already noted them in their reviews.<br /><br />There is also a shocking and disappointing lack of meaningful liner notes in this set. More time and care should have been taken to research these recordings, including session dates, personnel, and other background information, particularly about the two versions of \\"Somewhere in England.\\" A collection like this cries out for a Mark Lewisohn or Allen Wiener to produce liner notes of such quality and the paying customer deserves them. After all, what does David Fricke really know about George Harrison that most fans couldn't have written themselves?<br /><br />An artist who was as gifted and original as George Harrison (quite apart from his Beatles recordings) deserves a truly comprehensive compendium of his work. Sadly, this otherwise enjoyable, but overpriced, box is not it.
B00029LNHS|4.0|Ive been a Peas fan since before they were big. This CD is good but a lot of the old fans see it as more of a sell-out album. Dont get me wrong, its a good CD, it has some songs that is closer to their nature like \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" are great. I hate the other version \\"Let's Get it Strated\\". That was a blaitent sell out song... I cant stand hearing it. I have heared a pre-release of the next album \\"Monkey Business\\" and it is way more intune with their original sound. This is a good album but if you LOVE this album and this type of sound then their next album might not be for you...

The film, after all these years, still remains one of the highest grossing films in history (currently at 450+ million dollars).<br /><br />Taking place roughly twenty years after \\"Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith\\", \\"Star Wars\\" (renamed \\"Epiosde IV: A New Hope\\" in 1999, after the release of the first prequel film) has the galaxy under the grip of the tyrannical Galactic Empire (the former Republic from the prequel films).<br /><br />The Empire's ultimate weapon, The Death Star (shown in a skelatal structure at the end of \\"Sith\\") has come to fruition & spells certain doom for the small band of rebels trying to restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br />Princess Leia, senator of the planet Alderaan, races home aboard her starship after stealing schematic plans to the battle station. Imperial forces, led by Darth Vader, intercept the ship, take Leia hostage, & destroy the ship, but, not before the Princess records a short message to Genaral Obi-Wan Kenobi & downloads the message with the valuable, stolen Death Star plans into a nearby astromech droid. As fate would have it, Artoo-Detoo is the recipient & with his companion See-Threepio use an escape pod to get off the ship blasting to the planet of Tatooine below.<br /><br />Once on the surface, & through some unusual circumstances, the droids fall into the hands of Owen Lars, & his step-nephew, Luke Skywalker. While cleaning up the two droids, Luke accidently stumbles across the ending of the message Artoo was trying to  keep hidden (\\"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Your my only hope\\").<br /><br />Luke tells his Uncle about the message & in response wants both droids memory's erased (it must have dawned on Owen that both droids have been here before & he knows the history surrounding them). Luke also asks if he can join the Academy (most of his friends have already gone), but, his Uncle also nixes that idea (as Luke leaves the dinner table, in a huff, Owens wife, Beru, tells him that Luke has to much of his father's spirit in him. Owen's reply, \\"That's what I'm afraid of.\\").<br /><br />But, Artoo has other plans. Insistent on delivering the message to Obi-Wan, Artoo ditches Threepio, while Luke & his family are at dinner, & goes searching for the Jedi Knight himself. Upon this discovery, Luke sets out early the following morning, with Threepio, & unknowingly sets his destiny to become a Jedi Knight into motion.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars\\" is the first film to be released, but, is Episode IV, chronilogically in the overall saga. Thanks to the monsterous success of this film, the rest of the saga was a go. \\"Star Wars\\" was first created as a stand alone film (in case it flopped at the box-office). With its first re-release, the film then had the \\"Episode IV, A New Hope\\" moniker attached to the opening prologue. Nominated for 11 Oscars (winner of 8).<br /><br />Over the past 28 years:<br />\\"Star Wars\\" has been re-released 7 times (including the Special Edition release) in theaters,& released on video 7 times (including the 2004 DVD release, a repricing in the late 80's, & a repackage (very badly) in the early 90's ). I've seen a very early rental copy of \\"Star Wars\\", with a plastic clamshell box that says \\"for rental only\\" at the bottom of the box from 1983, go for sale on e-bay, a few years back, for roughly 250 to 300 bucks. Thats a rarity.<br /><br />Differences over the years:<br /><br />The film had different audio tracks according to the film's format in theatre's (two types of formats were used in the original release, 35 mm & 70 mm. The 35 mm tracks were recorded first for national distribution while the 70 mm tracks were recorded for special releases. Rumor has it that these tracks weren't finished until the morning of the film's release).<br /><br />In 1997, the original trilogy was released in theatres as Special Edition's. the negative for \\"Star Wars\\" was cleaned up with a few new scenes added among them:<br /><br />The Stormtrooper squad that finds the droids escape pod is a lot bigger than in the original release. Overall, nice effect that either way doesn't kill the film.<br /><br />Mos Eisley spaceport gets a big redo. Instead of the hole in the ground from the original release, here its a big spaceport complete with ships taking off & all sorts of new scum & villainy walking the streets. Overall, this was always Lucas' vision, but, again, due to time & budget back in the day he had to make due with what he had. Still, he didn't need to take out the werewolf creature from the cantina.<br /><br />During the confrontation between Greedo & Han Solo, Greedo shoots first while the original shot of Solo firing is now a retaliation shot. The most absolute damning thing George Lucas has done to the moviegoing public (that includes \\"Howard The Duck\\"). This basiclaly destroys some of Han Solo's character. This guy doesn't take s*it from anybody. But, with the tinkering of this shot, its now just in self-defense. It sucks anyway you look at it.<br /><br />Jabba The Hutt makes an appearance (he was originally supposed to be in the film, but, due to budget & money constraints in 1976, he could never be fully realized). A fully grown Boba Fett is also present in the background setting up his bigger role in \\"Empire\\". Overall, cool effect & the scene was always meant to be there. But, Jabba looks a bit odd & doesn't look like the Jabba from \\"Return Of The Jedi\\".<br /><br />Han Solo is chased by battalions of Stormtrooopers instead of five. Overall, funny effect, but, so was the original.<br /><br />Certain dogfight scenes were replaced with CGI substitues to make the battle's more tight & fast. Overall, needed in spots & the battle is now more of a grand scale assault.<br /><br />A new scene between Luke & his friend Biggs Darklighter has been added before the space battle at the climax of the film. Note: a line about Luke's father is cut. As Red Leader is about to speak to Luke & Biggs a crewman walks in front of the camera with Red Leader, saying \\"You'll do all right.\\" The correct line is \\"If your as good a pilot as your father was, You'll do all right.\\" Overall, nice scene that lets the viewer in on a little bit of the friendship between Luke & Biggs before his death.<br /><br />For the 2004 DVD release:<br /><br />A new Jabba The Hutt takes the place of the old. Overall, needed. The new Jabba looks more like the \\"Jedi\\" Jabba, and is better for it.<br /><br />A 27 year old film gaffe is finally fixed. If you have an old VHS copy of the film, fast forward to the scene where just after Darth Vader cuts down Obi-Wan Kenobi, notice when the big metal doors close, take a careful notice to the color of Vader's lightsabre.

B0002BO0AS|2.0|This record is as unoriginal as it is rocking.  The songs become a game of \\"What band do they sound like now - Lamb of God (raspy growls), Killswitch Engage (vocal adlibs), or Shadows Fall (twin guitar harmonies)?\\"  Sometimes the group even sounds like Atreyu, another band of imitators, but minus Atreyu's gift for drama.  Everything is well-played, and the bass tone is full and warm.  But this is metalcore strictly by the numbers, sounding very \\"2004.\\"  It's time for chops this accomplished to get a sound of their own.

B0008G2IRO|5.0|I've had Gorillaz self-titled album since early 2003, and it has rarely left my 3 disc CD player. It's just a mind-bogglingly brilliant piece of work. So I felt compelled to get Demon Days as soon as it came out. And I did. And while I do love this album...it's most definitely not \\"more of the same.\\" <br /> <br />The vibe, the sound, the overall feel the first album, none of them have carried over to \\"Demon Days.\\" It's all changed. And when you really think about it, it's not surprising. It's almost like Damon Albarn has decided that since the \\"band\\" isn't an actual band, he'll just do whatever he wants with the sound of Gorillaz whenever he feels like it, to hell with what anyone else wants or expects. And he can. And he does. From funk/dance/hip-hop/rock blend on the self-titled album, to the \\"Whatever genre the song is, take it to the extreme\\" G-Sides, to Laika Come Home, an album of nothing but dub reinterpretations, to now Demon Days, a strange blend of club-vibe, bass driven riffs, a dash of hip-hop, some choir performances, and a much more minimalist sound than before. In one respect, this is just like the first Gorillaz album, in that after listening to it, I said to myself \\"I've never heard anything that sounds quite like this before.\\" <br /> <br />Of course, just because something is fresh and unique doesn't mean you'll like it. And while I thoroughly enjoy this album up and down, I can understand how fans of the self-titled album might not like this one. They're completely different beasts. And there's nothing out there musically that you can compare with this album, so I can't say \\"If you like this and that, then you'll like Demon Days.\\" I can only suggest that you give the album a listen, without expectations, and judge for yourself. The only thing I find myself \\"missing\\" from this album is a song with Del...oh well. Can't have it all. <br /> <br />Special Edition: If you're the kind of person that like extras, then I highly recommend it over the normaledition. It comes with a neat little CD holder, and the booklet is much cooler than the standard one, with notes and selected lyrics for each song (Would've preferred full lyrics for each song, they could've fit them, but hey, take what you can get) It also comes with a DVD with and extra audio track, video for \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" and some other goodies, and it also unlocks special sections of the Gorillaz website. I haven't checked out any of that stuff, since my computer doesn't have a DVD-ROM, but I got it for only $2 more than the standard version, and just the cool packaging alone was worth it for me.
B000002MT0|5.0|True to title, this album is super-sexed.  But despite the theme, there's plenty of variation. \\"Loose!\\" has rave-y synth stabs; \\"Dark\\" has honest-to-goodness blues guitar.  In \\"Solo,\\" Prince unleashes chilling and note-perfect acapella singing.  Eerie keyboards underlie much of the album and soften the early `90's New Jack swing.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|The dvd is amazing purchase, and hard to belive that people are actully selling it for under 7 dollars. The dvd package is great, the speical features are really worthwhile. The story lacks, but the live performances were a treat. I found in interviews, they are annoying and seemed to be drugged out of there minds. Couldnt they find better interviews? This dvd is a great buy, but if you want a complete story on a band-check out the Beatles anthology. The speical features on the Beatles lack, making the Who's speical features the winner. Anther problem I had is who did this band make it for over 14 years? They never seemed to talk to one anther, Pete Townshend hogged all the spotlight, Keith Moon interupted basically all interviews and said a wise remark; I wondered if Moon suffered for ADD or just was crazy like that.
B000006NPY|3.0|Electronics, pianos, and acoustic guitars replace then-fired drummer Jimmy Chamberlain and the trademark buzzing squall.  Results are mixed; songs range from catchy (\\"Perfect\\") to pleasant (\\"Annie-Dog\\") to pointless (a 17-second last track).  Intimate and heavy on atmosphere, this album will please fans of the band's \\"lullaby\\" side.
B00004R99J|1.0|This is the most racist movie I have ever seen.  PC to the max.
B000669GAI|2.0|For a band self-styled on being contrarian, this collection reveals Pearl Jam as safe and middle-of-the-road.  Disc 1 (\\"Up\\") contains more rocking fare, including the requisite anthems from \\"Ten,\\" as well as \\"hits\\" from the band's increasingly anti-commercial output afterwards.  Quirkier moments like \\"Do the Evolution\\" stand out amongst largely generic blues-based rock.  Disc 2 (\\"Down\\") contains more pensive material, and is downright miserable, skirting perilously close to Hootie and the Blowfish.  Blatant ripoffs of Neil Young (\\"Not for You\\") and Led Zeppelin (\\"Given to Fly\\") also detract.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I love the first three SOAD albums, and this one is amazing as well, but it's lacking something the first three had.  Daron sings on his own more often... and he really shouldn't be, because his voice is nowhere close to Serj.  In addition, the lyrics still have the same political/societal message as usual, but they seem much more straightforward than in the past, which is somewhat disappointing.  Again, this is probably Daron's fault-- the lyrics to each song were either written entirely by him, or mainly by him, with Serj given secondary credit.   For me, it's always been Serj's amazing voice and lyrical skill that defined SOAD, and his diminished presence here really shows.  I'm just hoping this is a temporary thing, with Mesmerize being more of a Daron album, and Hypnotize going back to being more Serj.   <br /> <br />Anyhow, I'd still recommend this CD, if you're a System fan, or anyone else... it's good stuff, but be warned it's not on the same level as the previous albums.

B0008G2IRO|3.0|I honestly looked forward to this release and have purchased it blindly. I did grab \\"Gorillaz\\" and \\"G-Sides\\" and enjoyed the originality.  <br />  If you are looking for the stellar album of the year, go else where! However, I find that some of these CDs that are a little different or have an ability to blend music genres together differently are sometimes the CD you grab.  <br />  This is definitley not the album of the year, but I did enjoy the overall creativity of the the CD/DVD. Blending the Hip/Hop, Rock, and Pop does build a creative energy within this release. I especially enjoyed the vocals of the CD. These vocals almost tailor correctly to the track and the vocals seem to speak in unison to the music. For instance, in \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" the vocals almost slide away. Pretty solid in the start and straight through, but after some middle ground including some Hip-Hop lyrics, the vocals change to be more submissive and hesitant. Then, it builds back to the positive. <br />  I will give this three stars, but overall, this should be a CD in your collection. A truly great experience with great lyrical value and sound. It really is a great CD with many different Genres and experiences. Pick it up, try to get the DVD/CD combo for a few bucks more. This will not be a disapointment, but will not knock you over. Buy It!
B00097DX3U|4.0|This is not a case of sophomore jinx.  It is a progression that sees Audioslave soften up, slow down and... frankly, get a little boring.  The rolling tunes are still there, but mellowed. Chris Cornell is still his brooding self but he is left to drone on too long on many  tracks.  Somebody needs to tell him he doesn't need to be singing the whole length of every song.  In fact, the best song on the album (Be Yourself) is only outstanding because the music is allowed to stand by itself.  This band has potential which has only partly been unfolded, and this album seems like a step in the wrong direction.    Audioslave has yet to truly open up.
B00006EXL5|3.0|Why do people keep comparing this to Thursday?  They sound nothing like Thursday. (I adore Thursday.) I think this album is 'ok'.  last two tracks are my favorite but it's just like \\"Three Cheers...\\" where I can't get over his annoying voice.  It's just a bit much. (One track in 3 cheers is a perfect example, where he says \\"by the grace of goooooooooood\\".  He always sounds like he's just been crying for 3 hours and has that 3 year old-temper-tantrum-can't-catch-my-breath sound.)<br /><br />Still, good stuff, ok, mediocre, a better than 'nothing special'.  Not saying I hate them, just that they're albums aren't on heavy rotation in my stereo.  Buy it if it's cheap.  Better yet download 6-7 songs from either album to get a feel and then buy it if you like it.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I would still give The Aviator 5 out of 5. Or an A. The Aviator was perfect but Million Dollar Baby was just better. Cate Blanchett once again gave a wonderful performance! Deserving for it's 5 oscars. This just wasn't Martin Scorsese's best film.
0790732203|5.0|I can say without hyperbole that this movie marked the stunning introduction of our generation's greatest actor. Not Tom Cruise, who would go on to such one-dimensional roles as an overcompensating F-14 pilot, nor the already well-established, and frequently partially clothed, Rebecca De Mornay. No, I am speaking of the great Curtis Armstrong, who captured the zegiest of the generation that came of age in the 1980s with his Risky Business coda, \\"Sometimes, you've just got to say what the f---.\\" You see flashes of the brilliance that would later become abundant to all in his starring role as Booger, a cinematic Everyman in the second-greatest film trilogy in film history, the Revenge of the Nerds series, and in his later maturation into a serious dramatic actor, including such emotionally gripping roles as Drunkard #2 in Disney's Huckleberry Finn, which proved that 30 seconds of screen time is more than sufficient to carry a film. Admittedly, Risky Business has its share of trite dialogue and predictable plotting, but it's well worth sitting through it to see the origins of one of cinema's true masters.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|IMHO, this work stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with anything else... not like anything else out there.  innovative, intuitive, original, resilient, intriguing, diverse, passionate, depth, maturity, spiritual.<br /><br />true to the band's name, this is a bevy of instrumental effects and sensations.  national treasure!  world-class.<br /><br />mystic. can music be captured?  can he be captured?  Robert Strange Sensation Plant. (just teasing)<br /><br />I think the music has equalled his enigmatic lyrics! in the nicest way.  I like him wherever he's at.  one song into the next comes in mighty waves.<br /><br />A.T.: wonder-ful. rolling percussion underpinning set against his contrasting nuance lightened voice. great start!<br /><br />SIAA: mesmerizing. heartbeat rythmn. powerful. flawless. (strikes a chord in me...what I say everyday: 'I live in and expand my Lovelight to all, and to All That Is.')<br /><br />F.F.: rock on!  ageless voice.  effective use of his voice as an additional instrument in the band.<br /><br />TPA: strange sensation!  lesson: never take Robert (or the band) for granted.  lyrics taught me not to rest on my laurels...keep moving along...there's stories to be told.  music as a vehicle for message. like a train pacing itself against the breaks in the steel rails. click clack. very nice.  leave it to Robert to come up with the new and (this story's) the strangely beautiful!<br /><br />ATKH: nice acoustic.  Grrr has an engaging lilting way of ending notes...walking on air.  returning to innocence as we're getting older.<br /><br />T.

B00012QM86|5.0|Being one of the most obsessive students in history I try to exploit a historical movies' weakness by making a joke about some misquotation or enormous inaccuracy.  <br />For once I could not. Schindler's List is such a haunting masterpiece I get chills whenever I hear the soundtrack. Everything is done so dramatically and it all fits together so perfectly it's like your there as its occuring. It's a movie that with all the bad things going on in the world there are still (Some) good people and we can all relate to that. After the engrossing 3 and a hald hour movie is over you relize that the holocaust really did happen and in some parts of the world genocidal activities really do still take place.  <br />This movie is NOT for the weak of heart as it graphically depicts humans being beat, shot, tortured, starved, and even gassed in hauntingly graphic sequences. Kids shouldn't see this movie as many children are depicted being murdered. We can all learn a lesson from this movie...whatever it be.

B00003CXCT|2.0|After seeing the prequels i was pretty exicited to see the rest of the story so I bought the trilogy set. Quite dissapointing. The old movies are nothing compared to the prequels as regards the special effects which ofcourse is to be expected. But I must say the acting in these movies is much better. The last scene in episode VI with Hayden Christensen is a nice touch. But the first two movies are a bit slow and they tend to drag a little. I would not recommend this series unless you want some prehistoric special effects, average acting and some humour or if you want to complete your star wars collection like me. The music ofcourse is classic John Williams.
B000683VI4|5.0|When I read a book and/or see a movie that inspires me, I want to become a better person.  Everyone should be so lucky to have a person love them just a fraction of the time this story tells.  This is the best love story I have ever seen.  It inspired me to look at my life and remind myself how very lucky I am, as well.
B0006PV5U8|4.0|This is my first foray into the reissued RCA Living Stereo hybrid SACD disks that have gotten a lot of publicity in recent months. Others in the batch of releases include some Rubinstein piano concertos, French music by Charles Munch and some of Fritz Reiner's orchestral specialties in Chicago.<br /><br />This CD features legendary fiddler Jascha Heifitz mated to three different conductors and orchestras doing the Sibelius, Prokofiev No. 2 and Glazunov concertos. Heifitz was closely linked with the first two, less so with the third one. He does them all quite well here in sound that is as good as advertised, at least based on what my equipment tells me.<br /><br />I bought this both before and after I converted to 5.1 SACD. The recording is wonderful in SACD and almost as good in traditional stereo. In particular, the timpani underpinning of the Prokofiev accompaniment by Munch and the Boston Symphony is quite thrilling. So to is the backup by Hendl and the Chicago Orchestra in the Sibelius.<br /><br />However, a better recording can also show flaws that perhaps weren't as obvious before. In the waning moments of the Sibelius opening movement, there is a time -- maybe 5-6 bars in duration -- where Heifitz, Hendl, the symphony and one of its principal woodwind players seem to be missing connections by a half-beat or so. This is a minor quibble and will do little to discourage enjoyment of this otherwise fine issue.<br /><br />As to the performances, the Sibelius is an example of Heifitz's searing tone and remarkable bowing. The accompaniment by Hendl and the CSO is a bit more severe than some of the more romanticized accounts but fully in sync with Heifitz direction.<br /><br />I've heard accounts of the Prokofiev that concentrated more fully on the music's dreamy legato. In this version Heifitz and Munch seem more attuned the the spiky nature of Prokofiev's creation while maintaining a marginal aloofness, as if they are old juveniles having fun with the 20th century creation. It works fine both ways and this is a good one.<br /><br />Heifitz and Hendl, this time with the RCA Symphony Orchestra, seem more romantically engaged in the slight 18-minute concerto by Glazunov. This romantic trip through lightweight Russian music is a fitting end to a wonderful CD brought up to 21st century speed by the new technology of SACD.<br /><br />This issue is handsomely packaged in a durable CD case and includes the original LP notes plus other notes by Joseph Wechsberg from 1959. There are also notes on the history of Living Stereo and some chatter on technical details, plus a separate set of notes on SACD and how it works.<br /><br />Wechsberg's notes begin: \\"There can be no doubt today (1959) that Jascha Heifitz is the greatest violinist of our generation. When all is listened to and said and done, Heifitz' supremacy as fiddler and musician emerges as one of the few unchallenged facts of our clouded musical age.\\"<br /><br />There is still little debate today (2005) about the first half of Wechsberg's thesis -- that Heifitz is the greatest fiddler. His tone, technique, bowing and sound continue today to blow away most competitors and this splendid sounding CD reinforces his greatness as a player.<br /><br />But as an artist? Well, there's the rub. The performances on this CD are very good but I have heard more artistic renderings of the Sibelius and can imagine more committed versions of the Prokofiev. The legend of Heifitz was, generally speaking, of his stature as a player, where he continues to be without parallel.<br /><br />But his artistic approach to the music he played has been questioned for many years. Lots of listeners -- especially those that more fully appreciate the Oistrakh-Vengerov approach -- will prefer other fiddlers in these works.<br /><br />I don't belong to either camp and appreciate players with all viewpoints. I found this CD to be well worth the $12 list price. The sound puts it into direct competition with today'sbest new DDD recordings, something you couldn't say about past issues. For collectors that have yet to sample the legend of Heifitz, this would be a good starting point.best new DDD recordings, something you couldn't say about past issues.

B0008G2IRO|4.0|I remember when I first heard the gorillaz. I was on a school field trip to the roller rink for an end of the year celebration. After eating everything in the place, my friends and I made our way to the rink, rented some crappy rollerskates and made our best effort to not to fall and look dumb or break the rollerskates that were held together by duct tape. Then, the rent-a-dj decided he was done for the day and spun the last track of the night. Low and behold, it was Clint Eastwood. Not only was this what made me love the gorillaz, this is, to the best of my memory, the first rap song i actually liked, as opposed to the mainstream crap i had heard on commercial radio. <br /> <br />That holiday season, I only had one item on my wish list: The gorillaz debut album. For 11th birthday, I received a walkman, and the gorillaz cd. It was all cartoonish, which I thought was cool beyond everything I had ever seen. I popped it into the walkman, and regained the love I felt that night. It was still there.  <br /> <br /> Two days later, still listening and loving it, I decided to do an internet search on the gorillaz. All the biographies and information archives seemed to indicate that the gorillaz weren't real, but rather a big cartoon reality backed by djs and several guest vocalists, backed by Damon Albarn of Blur. Having my fantasy smashed about going to a concert and meeting the band and getting there autograph, etc, really didnt phase me at all. The concept of a cartoon band only made me love them even more. <br /> <br />So you can imagine my joy when i heard feel good inc, which is possibly one of my all time favorite songs. A new gorillaz cd??? The band that ignited my love for hip hop??? I had to have it. I waited until the release date, bought the special edition, and rushed home, hoping to hear more of the same/similar gorillaz i knew from before.  <br /> <br />To make a long story short, thats far from this album. Demon Days is a completely different experience thanthe first, less happy and more somber. What i loved about the first album was how experimental it was, and how different every song was. Clicking through the songs on demon days, it sounds like they have found their niche and have defined the band they want to be. But in my opinion, they were better when they didnt know. Because they end product is a bunch of unintelligible songs that I have tried so hard to like, but with no avail. With that being said, PLEASE, AUTOMATOR, COME BACK!!!!!!! dont get me wrong, danger mouse is tight, but i dont think hes the right man for the job. Now the grey album, there was a cool cd. The experimental beats and genres were what kept the gorillaz (and the grey album, as long as im on that topic) tight.  <br /> <br />But enough with the negative, there were some tracks on this cd that I really liked. Here is a short review <br /> <br />Intro- Some oboe thing or something, I don't really know. Not digging it, this track was pretty boring. Oh well, it's just the intro. Who cares if it sucks? 4/10 <br />Last Living Souls- Starts with some drumming, cues in Albarns off key, low key talk/singing, then comes in some new wave keyboards that steadily grow more upbeat. Kind of obnoxious, but I can listen to it, maybe just out of hope that the song will take a turn for the better. 6/10 <br />Kids with Guns- I dont care what people say, this bass riff is NOT tight. Here come the crappy talk/singing vocals. Takes a slight turn for the better after some guitars come in. Sorry though, still not diggin it. 5/10 <br />O Green World- Mediocre bass riff, with heavy percussion, some bird shrieking or something, then comes in a pretty tight guitar part, with choir like oh's, then distorted vocals from Albarn aka 2D. Pretty good 7/10 <br />Dirty Harry- This was one of the songs I liked a bit more. It starts of with some cool instrumentals, then some vocals which dont add much really, but then a children's choir comes in, which cant help but remind me ofthe wall by pink floyd. After that, it gets techno with a cool melody. This continues for awhile, then goes into a rap segment by some dude named Bootie Brown, which caught me off guard but I still liked it. 8/10 <br />FEEL GOOD INC- I dont really know what to say about this song, youve all probably heard it before. Tight bass riff enters in with some talkish vocals, which are wearing thin but i can tolerate them. You cant really understand the vocals, and after you learn them and try to sing along it sounds kinda weird. Cool drums, peaceful interval singing about a windmill, then comes the hard hitting rap solo by De La Soul. This is what reminded me of Del's work on Clint Eastwood. This bizarre chemistry they have with opposite genres that fluctuate a lot, it really shouldnt work, and it almost feels like two different songs (other than the bass riff). But it works. Really, really well. Way to go mouse. 11.5/10 <br />El Manana- low key, one of the few songs on this CD that doesnt change styles or vocalists frequently. Really nice vocals from Albarn. Gotta love this one man. Its growing on me. 9/10 <br />Every Planet We Reach is Dead- Hardcore intro with keyboard and synthesizer, I like it so far. It drops the keyboards and syth to give way to some slow, sweet vocals by Albarn. Then, goes back to the keyboard and synth. I like this one too 8.5/10 <br />November Has Come- I like this song, tight rhymes by MF Doom, nice chorus by Albarn. Also, my birthday is in November. 9/10 <br />All Alone- This song is really bizarre. It starts with echo vocals: \\"All alone, all alone\\" with some chipmunk like singers. Then, it hits you with some heavy percussion, which gives way to an awesome rap segment by Roots Manuva. Awesome, seriously. 9.5/10 <br />White Light- repetitive, ok bass and drums, then comes with some weird guitar, which really threw me off. My least favorite song by far. Sorry guys, youre getting a 4. 4/10 <br />Dare- This song has a more techno feel, with an 80'sstyle keyboard and vocals with some mediocre vocals. Pretty good, i cant find much bad things to say about it. 7.5/10 <br />Fire Coming out of a Monkey's Head- Storytelling mixed with twangy guitar, with refrains by Albarn that were kind of folksy but awesome. A good addition to the album. 8.5/10 <br />Dont Get Lost in Heaven- this song didnt really fit with the others in my mind, but why not??? nothing really fit together on the debut record, and thats what i loved it for. Soft Piano, with a choir singing in the background. 7/10 <br />Demon Days- Opens with violin, and high pitched woo wooing in the background, then some unintelligible falsetto vocals. Pretty good, didnt really stand out in my mind. 6/10 <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this is a good album, worth getting probably. I wouldnt recomend the deluxe edition, because theres not much there other than the feel good inc video and hilarious commentary on it.  <br /> <br />Thanks for reading, Malcolm
B00082IJ08|3.0|Danger Mouse is a creative guy, and the beats he provides are definitely above average, some are even pretty good. However, what he did was create his own version of Gorillaz. Obviously this is good because he should be able to shine on his own, but without Dan The Automator, the \\"band\\" loses it's backbone. It's like comparing Audioslave to Rage Against the Machine. The talent is there and most of it is intact, but it's still not the same. If you want more of the last album stay clear, this one fails to deliver.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I am a huge 50 Cent fan but this cd is absolute garbage.  I thought  his first cd was on of the best ever...up the with the chronic 2001 and other great gangsta albums.  He was one of the best..if not the best rapper until this album.  He steered away from his old style and decided to go in a different direction which turned out to be the wrong move.  There are probably at most 4 decent songs on this album.  I mean wtf is this piggy bank crap!!!  He needs to stop dissing people it and most of the time when u diss on people it ruins the song.  What the hell is happening with 50 and Game.  Personally i think 50 is getting a little ROID RAGE over the fact that Game is stealing some attention from 50.  If you want an awesome west coast cd go pick up The Documentary from the Game!!
B0007Y08IS|2.0|Okay, I just saw the unedited puppet intimate scene, and it is by far one of the funniest things I've seen in d*mn near a decade. still, Janeane Garofalo did not deserve to die, nor did Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, or George Clooney.

B00004HYLF|5.0|This was the ultimate in jazz fusion. I was only 16 years old when I first heard it and I was blown away. My brother was 18 at the time and was/is a guitatist. He got so deep into Al DiMeola, that before we knew it he was playing just as fast. Blam, his fingers started to bleed that is how fast he was going. He hadn't obviously built up the kinda callouses needed for that kind of speed. Come on, what is there not to love? Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Al DiMeola, and one of my favorite drummers Lenny white. <br /> <br />Just buy the darn thing. <br />
0790742780|5.0|Somehow, all of us - through the time of our lives - have experienced a border line situation. Sometimes you may control yourself, but others simply are out of control, grow in intensity and involve you with unpredictable consequences.<br /><br />A middle class man, rigid and austere is in the traffic when the day begins. And suddenly in a crucial scene that reminded me so much to 81/2, he gets off his car and runs to evade the ominous reality and troubling stress.<br /><br />Without hesitating, he decides to make his own codes in the urban jungle. The camera will be the loyal witness that will allow to engage with him and even understand the reasoning beneath the madness.<br /><br />The psychological process of self destruction was carried to unexpected limits. Haunting and unforgettable film that needed perhaps a more dramatic punch, but with a so well supporting cast that you may excuse some holes in the script and melodramatic concessions: Barbara Hershey, as always, shone with her own light as his wife, and so Robert Duvall as the implacable chaser was overwhelming too.<br /><br />To my mind this has been the second best performance of Michael Douglas after Wall Street.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this film.  It was by far the worst movie I've seen this year.  In fact, it was so bad that I doubt I'll be able to enjoy watching the main 4 actors ever again. <br /> <br />Although some people feel that watching 4 people destroy each other is beautiful, I find it to be depressing.  This movie is about 4 \\"lovers\\" who use each other uncaringly, cry a lot, use the \\"f\\" word multiple times in every sentence, and who are completely unlikeable.  It's like the director thought that having 4 beautiful people in a film was enough.  I love a good drama, but this wasn't even close.  <br /> <br />The plot is as shallow as the characters.  The ending is very silly; we find out information that the film makers thought would create a \\"Usual Suspects\\" type of ending, but it all falls flat and seems contrived.  Amazon has many better DVDs for sale than this garbage.
6305079811|4.0|Forget the \\"cheesy\\" complaints about the FX in this film. Helloooooo....the effects look the way they do ON PURPOSE. This film is art directed with great skill and originality. It goes into that same category as \\"Prospero's Books\\" and \\"Orlando\\"...a beautiful worthwhile failure. Costumes and sets are phenomenally beautiful and clever. Bugle beading for days and comic book colors. Perfection. Queen's score is not the highlight. The look is. The failure comes from incoherent directing [I worked on a film with Michael Hodges....who also brought us the original \\"Get Carter\\"...and he's not great] and some questionable casting [though some is right on the money].<br /><br />But this film has a great script [very tongue in cheek] and is visually stunning. So much so that it is worth its weight in hot pink silk satin. And well worth waiting for a re-release if doctored up to look sharp.<br /><br />Now if they'd just release \\"Prospero's Books\\"!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Mighty Rearranger--Robert Plant<br /><br />Upon first listen you will be taken aback if you were<br /><br />expecting straight forward rock n roll. What you get is a<br /><br />rich tapestry of woven pieces and nuances. What you don't<br /><br />realize is that a seed is planted in your mind. From then<br /><br />on you hear certain parts and pieces of the songs melody and<br /><br />as you hear the songs again the seed starts to grow.<br /><br />In the layers of the music, you hear the Zepplinesque sound<br /><br />fused with tribal earthy beats with techno electronica<br /><br />thrown in the mix to produce something truly unique. The<br /><br />listener<br /><br />gets transported through the rich textures. Images form, in<br /><br />ones mind, of landscapes of open wideness, heat, dust, sun,<br /><br />a desert. Images of the open frontier, where the cowboy<br /><br />would ride by day and in the evening build a campfire.<br /><br />There are western guitar sounds filtered with tribal exotic<br /><br />undertones. You can almost hear the call of the old blues<br /><br />fusing with the hypnotic tribal beat producing something<br /><br />totally new.<br /><br />Robert's voice front and center of the recording, makes<br /><br />things sound intimate. He sings from a soft whisper to the<br /><br />un-leasing of his famous monstrous wails. His lyrics are<br /><br />from the heart, having a mystical, magical quality.<br /><br />This CD is not for the headbanger, who wants screaming<br /><br />guitars and the usual let's rock lyrics, but for the<br /><br />listener who wants something unique and intriguing.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br /><br />Enchanter<br /><br />Another Tribe<br /><br />Shine it All Around<br /><br />Tin Pan Valley<br /><br />All the Kings Horses<br /><br />Let The Four Winds Blow<br /><br />Takamba<br /><br />Dancing in Heaven<br /><br />Mighty Rearranger<br /><br />*hidden track after Brother Ray, Techno version of Shine it<br /><br />all Around*<br /><br />Vilma~<br /><br />[...]
B00082IJ08|4.0|Ah, happy national cd release day.  <br /> <br />This album is great because of its tightness- beats are perfectly timed and the vocals are beautiful (missed Kool Keith though). The addition of Danger Mouse is clear. In short, you've got your Clint Eastwood (Feel Good Inc.) and every other track is strong. If there's any justice in the music industry 'Demon Days' should be an early entry for Album of the Year.
0451207521|4.0|I became a Follet fan after reading \\"Eye Of The Needle\\" when I was a teenager, arguably one of the best WWII thrillers ever. I have read almost everything Ken Follet has written since, and I  concur his World War stories are the best. This is no exception, you can tell the author is having a blast while writing it. You will enjoy reading it too!.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Sub-standard action-horror movie that has all the makings of a good movie but lacks the right edge to push it forward. Keanu Reeves tries but fails in his role because of the way his character is written and not to mention the way he played his character as well. You actually think that he's making a joke out of the film with his very bad Clint Eastwood imitation but he stays in that mold thou out the entire film and you just get sick of it after a while. You don't care about him as a person at all and you just want to hit at some points of the film because of his stupidity.  Anti-heroes have a reason for their behavior and have the right kind of sympathy for their characters as well for the audience to care about what they are doing but you really don't care about Reeves character at all and you don't give a damn about what happens to him because there is really no back story to hold what he is doing as reasonable.  He's actually not very important to the story at all and is just there to fill space. The movie actually could have worked better with Rachel Weisz's character as the lead because she at the very least makes you care about what is happening with the film and what will happen with her character as well. Weisz not only deserves all the praise she has been getting from those who have seen the film but her performance is actually way too mature for this sloppy film to handle. She gives a very complex and sophisticated performance with a very deep rooted character that has more levels of reality than this movie has and that's where the movie fails because it rather be a dumb special effects film than a mature horror movie that actually makes you think about what is going on. Weisz's performance not on makes you think but makes you wish that you were seeing a better film with just her character in it. The story makes no sense at all because it contradicts itself on several occasions and has a couple of loose plot points that does not further the story at all.It also has a big revelation at the end that makes no sense what so ever and is not even hinted at doing the course of the first three-quarters of the film.  There was a lot of potential for this to be an excellent film but with a very bad screenplay and a lackluster performance by Keanu Reeves, the film really had a up hill battle to be any good and in a sense, it is because of Rachel Weisz's amazing performance but she is basically by herself in what is any good this movie really has.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0380733358|5.0|Originally published in the late seventies this is still one of the best; if not the best, WWII espionage thrillers ever written. This is the book that put Ken Follet on the map. Several other novels mimic if not blatantly copy the stile, structure and story of this book, none of them surpass it thought. You can't go wrong with this one!  <br />

B00080ZG10|5.0|It seems impossible for Martin Scorcese to make a bad movie (he might have--I've never seen New York, New York), and he certainly hit a homer with this one. <br /> <br />It's a long movie--over 2-1/2 hours--but never boring, and I was disappointed that it ended when it did.  It may just be that Hughes is an inherently fascinating character, but Scorcese maintained tension--rising tension--from beginning to end.  The performances are great, but at first Cate Blanchette seems almost to be satirizing Hepburn in her portrayal of the great actress's mannerisms.  DiCaprio seems to have done his homework, and renders HH's obsessive-compulsiveness with an intensity that is never caricatured.  He certainly isn't the actor I would have expected to fill this role, but it's his, down to his bones. <br /> <br />This movie is a treat, definitely worth watching.
B00082IJ08|1.0|As a huge fan of Gorillaz debut album, I wondered if this side project of Blur's Damon Albarn would become anything other than a one trick pony. Well, the follow up has finally arrived, and it's a complete and total disappointment. <br /> <br />\\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is a decent song, but can't even compete with the coolness that \\"Clint Eastwood\\" reeked when it first hit the radio. Demon Days is a lot heavier on the hip-hop than the debut, which may or may not be a good thing. Personally, I was hoping for more songs along the lines of \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", my personal favorite track from the debut. <br /> <br />Overall, a terrible follow up that could have been something truly spectacular.

0451457994|5.0|To date, one of my favorite Sci-fi books (and that isn't many, I'm writing this to get Amazon to recommend more like this). It was very interesting, kept you holding on to it. It wasn't long enough to get bored, but wasn't nearly short enough to be pointless. It explains more about the movie which is nice. I recommend it.
1567184855|5.0|If you are like me searching for answers to such things as why were here, what is my purpose?etc? then this is the book to read, this book inspired me and opened up my mind, I now see things in a different light then before.  'Gosh what an amazing book! I have read other books concerning the spirit world but I often find that topics are not deep enough or haven't been explored in great depth showing case studies examples. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to reading the follow up from this book..which I have already ordered..
B0007OCG56|3.0|Let's start off with; this wasn't a bad movie, it simply needed some work.<br /><br />The story itself is a feel good kind of movie...often referred to as a `chick flick.'  There are no explosions, no guns, and no fist-fights.  Other than a nonnudity sex scene where Te'a Leoni tries to do an orgasm scene that just doesn't cut it, there isn't much to be embarrassed about when watching this with young kids.<br /><br />Overall I feel the director wanted his actors to be too over the top.  Te'a Leoni was waaaaaay over acting.  This is something that someone just doesn't do, but is told to do.  Cloris Leachman also had a few moments of over acting but for the most part was good and had some of the best lines in the movie to bring about a laugh.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce who plays Christina did a great job.  She was very convincing and pulled out some fine scenes.  Paz Vega who plays Flor is breathtakingly beautiful and is able to act extremely well.  (I hope she does many more films)  Sarah Steele who plays Bernice is bound to be a very popular actor because she can act.<br /><br />The `big' name, Adam Sandler was okay.  He isn't doing his normal funny guy thing in this film.  I feel his character wasn't well written so much of the fault lies with the writer, who by the way is the director.<br /><br />Overall, I watched it twice and enjoyed it both times but it's definitely not one I'll buy.
B00006BNDI|5.0|Burzum. The one man band created by Varg Vikernes, one of black metal's gods. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is probably one of black metal's most important and true albums. This is the true style, this is up there with Darkthrone's \\"Transilvanian Hunger\\". By the way, Varg also wrote the lyrics for tracks five through eight on that album. Anyway, This album is simplistic and short but that is not something that makes it any less good. This album has Varg's tortured misanthropic vocals with the buzz saw guitars and blast beat drums. The guitar is very much the highlight of this album, the sound chills you to the core and makes you wince like true black metal should. The four songs are listed below:  <br /> <br /> <br />1.) Det Som En Gang Var: Very cold and harsh, a great opener (5/5) <br /> <br />2.) Hvis Lyset Tar Oss: Very good and very true style, I think its too simple though (4/5) <br /> <br />3.) Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen: The best on the album, a hauntingly beautiful melodic guitar riff towards to end. The rest is cold and harsh black metal. (10/5)  <br /> <br />4.) Tomhet: Superb. This track displays Varg's pain and the cold music he creates (5/5)
B00005JMXX|1.0|I don't really need to say much. This movie is some more multi-million dollar budget trash. This movie is horrible. You don't have to see this to know whats going to happen in the end. What happens in the end of all movies that are garbage? We all know. I wish I could murder this movie.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes has produced their best DVD to date...I saw this tour live when they played Clarkston, MI and this DVD captures that experience completely.  It is absolutely magnificent; a dream set list (\\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Ritual\\", \\"Gates of Delirium\\", \\"And You and I\\" all on one DVD?!!! I'm sure Yes fans never thought they'd see the day...), flawlessly performed; the sound and video both excellent.  The way the concert was shot and edited was perfect, and should be a blueprint for how live concerts should be presented on DVD.  The orchestra really is a treat and you can see the joy on their faces when they are performing.  And of course we have the classic line-up of Anderson, Howe, White, and Squire.  Even without Wakeman in the band at this time (Yes fans always miss him when he's not in the band), the orchestra makes up for his absence and give all of the songs an extra lift and new life.  Bravo guys, thanks for a great show and DVD.  A special thanks to the production crew, director, and editor also for knowing how to capture a great performance on video.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is the best music that i've heard since Led Zeppelin IV.  I believe that this is the classic rock of our time.  Every song contributes to the great story of a person looking for his biological parents.  If you do not have this album then you probably should start working on that, broseph.  But hey don't overlook this one, seriously.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|This album is, simply put, fantastic and fun. The band members said they were going for a sound that people could dance to, but this is more than dance hall/club music. It is really good alternative rock and roll. The songs all have a similar sound, but are quite different upon true listening.  <br /> <br />The only drawback is the similar sound of all of the songs. If one doesn't like the sound of Franz Ferdinand, don't bother listening to the rest of the album.  However, if one does like the sound, it's an album that's good for more than a few straight-through listen-to's in the cd-player.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|I first saw this film on VHS and was delighted when it came out on DVD, especially in a Criterion edition.<br /><br />All right, it is slow in parts as the basis of the switch is spelled out, but then a rapid decision would be not in keeping with the period of the movie. You become immersed in the time period of the 16th Century.<br /><br />I feel the quality of the print is first rate, and if one compares the visual look of the preview trailer to the presented film, the difference is clear.  Ironically, the Japanese trailers and teasers are visually crisp.<br /><br />My greatest memory from having seen the VHS version was the final battle scene and the futility of it all.  Swords and spears against muskets is not a good match-up.  This is not a battle scene in the spirit of The Wild Bunch, so one gets the horror of the battle through visual looks of the spectators rather than the carnage on the field, although the aftermath of the battle is clear as to the terror of the battle.  I am glad Kurosawa chose not to make it a 'splatter' scene.  It was if the Generals could not believe what was happening and could not adapt.  The empty stools after the battle are more telling than any battle scene could be.<br /><br />This is a movie in the manner of great epics.  They surely don't make this type of movie anymore, except on computers.  The visuals are sweeping, and all of it with real people and horses.  To think that the warriors were sent into battle with large flags attached to poles on their backs is amazing, and a visual feast.<br /><br />Added:  I recently had the chance to re-watch the film, and the commentary, which made it much more enjoyable, as the contrast was made between the full length Japanese version, and the truncated American version.  The Criterion edition has the full version.
B00064X3BI|3.0|This is without a doubt Eric Claptons best album. After a couple of mediocre lps, Theres one in every crowd, E C was here, and No reason to cry where Eric was going in a more ambitious direction with special guests in his band and bigger productions (which is not always a good thing), Clapton decided to go back to a simpler low key approach. And it worked. Keeping his vocals to a minimum and letting his guitar do more of the talking, he came up with a beautifully solid and laid back sound, similar to his 461 Ocean Boulevard album which was his other classic. The classic Cocaine, Lay Down Sally, and The Core to name a few, this is a real feel good lp. Sometimes simpler is better. I'm sorry to report however that the SACD version of the album did disapoint me. The new surround mix was done by the original producer Glyn Johns, and you would think that since he handled the original recording, that he would really go all out on the remixing into surround on this LP. Unfortunately no. Don't get me wrong, this is a decent sounding mix. Clean and spacious but it could have been more dynamic. It sounds a little flat. Also a little muddy. However, it is definitely worth repeated listenings and still is a very enjoyable album. I still recommend it.
0743454537|3.0|I was not aware when I picked this book that the writing is probably around 7th-10th grade level. I found the use of different fonts to represent different characters fairly cheesy, especially since the same fonts were used for multiple characters, meaning you couldn't tell them apart without looking at the chapter head anyway. That said, I really enjoyed some of the more evocative metaphors, and I think I would have liked this book a lot more in 7th grade. <br /> <br />I agree with pretty much every other reviewer about the ending. It is extremely harsh and anticlimactic, especially considering the book spends 400 pages slooowly building up to it.
1573223085|3.0|With all the buzz lately about right-brained thinking and the growing panic over losing one's job to machines and under-paid Asian workers, I have to chuckle a bit at what I take to be the irony of messages like Pink's.<br /><br />The way I see it is that we all will (in fact we currently do) have a pressing need to think with both the right and left sides of our brain. We will need to become far more creative, more intuitive and a great deal more insightful about what occurs around us.<br /><br />Except this won't be because our jobs are being performed by a billion collge-educated Asians. It won't be because a machine can perform accounting duties as well as a 25-year accounting veteran. Hell, not even because machines will be fighting our wars for us.<br /><br />It's because we need a whole lot of brain power to get us out of the looming global environmental catastrophe. We'll need whole-brained thinkers to figure out how create sustainable living practices even though we've exhausted the plains, the forests and the oceans. We'll need new thinkers to figure out how to ween humanity off its destructive addiction to unchecked population growth.<br /><br />And we're going to need a helluva Einstein to figure out how to keep us from our slow but inexorably quickening slide into global biological/nuclear war.<br /><br />More likely, 50 years from now we'll need whole-brained thinkers just to figure out how to feed their families and find clean drinking water.<br /><br />So yes, I guess Pink is right; whole-brained thinkers will be invaluable to us in the near future. Being able to see the big picture is pretty useful to surviving.
B000003TAR|4.0|Nirvana's last album In Utero is a work of pure genious.Being <br />some of the last recordings of this legendary band helped shape <br />the fans views of the songs on this album.After Kurt's death, <br />the band started to get more attention.Some people saw some of the songs as a subliminal suicide note from kurt.For example <br />in the song Milk It one of the lines goes \\"look on the bright side is suicide\\".This,of course,may have been just coincidence. <br />Some of the dark vibe surrounding the album was due to kurt's struggle with heroin.The album is definetly different from Nevermind,but does carry some of the same feel as Bleach,Nirvana's first album.Though some of its muddy sound came from their bleach days,In Utero is definitely unique and has its own sound.I have been a hardcore Nirvana fan for years and deeply recommend this album to any fans of the grundge genre.It is personally my second favorite nirvana album.If your just becoming a Nirvana fan I would suggest you check out Nevermind first though.But overall,I think what makes this album great is that it is the last of possibly the greatest band ever.Nirvana's In Utero - the last works of a legend.
B00000099Y|1.0|Whoa! Everyone seems to have an opinion on this. Tool fans seem to go out of their way to convince the casual buyer that this record is the work of absolute genius, and that it will change you life etc. Being a rather nave and gullible individual I decided to give the album a whirl. I lay down, put my headphones on and prepared to be swept up in the brilliance that is tool and left drooling. Well, I fell asleep but I tried I really did! It's just this album is so monotonous!   A song about fisting? Yeah, I know it supposed to have a whole *deeper meaning*, but its still stupid, not to mention bloody painful. The five star reviewers make this album out to be intensely thought provoking and some even go as far by saying that it's so hard to comprehend that only a select few will grasp the true meaning. That's a load of codswallop! You don't have to be really intelligent to get this, there's nothing to get, its just pretentious whining. Albeit twisted to make it into *music for pseudo intellectuals*. I'd rather listen to korn, at least they're straight forward about it.  Tool fans are quick to insult the average human being for disliking their favorite band by dismissing them as ignorant twits. No, it's just the music is so dull I'm sure over exposure is enough to make anyone brain dead for a little while. My brain cells came out waving a white flag about half way through. I had to listen to skinny puppy to perk them back up again. In a way, tool fans remind me of born again Christians, as in you're either a blind follower or a total waste of space. It's like a cult. Perhaps that's the appeal. Does being a tool fan make you better then other people? If you think so then you are a sad, sad person. Perhaps you think my tiny brain just can't grasp the fact that tool are the best band in the world and that Maynard James Keenan (sounds like an Indian dish) is a god. Personally I think he's laughing his wig off at all of you. But anyway you can't be swayed. To the curious buyer, I'd listen to the samples and look up some of the lyrics before you start believing all the hype. By the way I just want to say the `secretary' from Boston is a plagiarizer. (...)Oh and one more thing. If Maynard James Keenan moved to Spain and (under Spanish law) married Pilar Gmez Daz, her name would remain Pilar Gmez Daz. If they had a daughter christened Mercedes, she will be called Mercedes James Gmez. If she got married to Juan Garca Martnez she would keep her original name but her son, Pedro, would be called Perdro Garca James. You see where this could go! Having such a long winded name is a danger to Spanish society!  Have you just read all that? If you have, you now know what listening to a tool album feels like. It's simple and easy to understand but presented in such a difficult and presumptuous way, that it just gets annoying and unnecessarily tedious after a while.
B00005JO8T|5.0|Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) and Jannek (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) are brothers living in Denmark: the former a loving husband/father and Danish troop visiting from Afghanistan, the latter an irresponsible drunk fresh from jail after assaulting a local woman. In the film's opening, we see Michael's subtle condescension to Jannek, his beautiful wife Sarah (Connie Nielson), his two adorable little girls: everything expected from the prototypical \\"good son.\\" Jannek is seen drinking, smoking, defending himself from his father's harsh judgement. Director Susanne Bier presents them as the human embodiments of paradox. But early in the film, Michael leaves his home for Afghanistan, where his helicopter is shot down and he is reported dead.  <br /> <br />Thus, the film takes a sharp turn and all changes, in some ways for the better.  <br /> <br />Jannek sees in Sarah opportunity. Initially, she is only responsibility (perhaps warming up to her and helping out a bit is the \\"right thing to do\\"), but when their relationship blooms they discover in each other catharsis, which leads to unexpected implications but ultimately the kind of positivity needed when a loved one dies and a void needs to be filled. But (and I'm not giving anything away, as this is revealed early on) Michael in fact survived the crash and is brought to an Afghani prison camp, forced to make a drastic decision and promptly saved from death twice, eventually returning home with the British army.  <br /> <br />Michael comes home to find his shelves replaced by Jannek's hand-made cabinets, children that look at him in fear, and a wife who suspects change. Bier studies Michael's reaction and change as a result of war and the effects this has on the emotional bonds he'd constructed before leaving for Afghanistan. Her observant style as director captures the nuance in every hug or conversation. Notice how the camera often closes in on a set of teary eyes or the way two people look at each other post-conversation. Bier provesto be a strong director in not only making every glance or set of dialogue poignant and necessary, but also by eliciting strong performances from her actors to fulfill what strengths she brings to the project.  <br /> <br />Strongest in the cast is Lie Kaas, who I've not seen before. He brings an unexpected dimension to Jannek. When he's shown as a former criminal and drunk Lie Kaas manages to capture Jannek's hidden vulnerability and emotional need, suggesting that there is good in him waiting to manifest; thus, the audience connects and is not alienated in the slightest. Lie Kaas also makes Jannek's change from distant to welcoming and warm seem natural, not forced or contrived. When Michael returns and supposes Jannek and Sarah slept together, observe the look of shock and worry on his face. This is fine acting, and in this moment Lie Kaas establishes an additional complexity and mystery in Jannek.  <br /> <br />Nielson is strong, true, and graceful, inhabiting Sarah with utmost maturity. Her performance is nomination-worthy, and her perceptive approach to the \\"frightened wife of scarred soldier\\" is not just luminous but unique. Thomsen is also breathtaking, bringing control to Michael's most intense moments post-alleged death.  <br /> <br />Some say the film is ultimately worthless, bringing nothing new to the table in its look at war's devastating effects on family life. Contrary to this opinion, Bier's masterly direction makes the film more about the characters than anything timely or political. I've seen \\"Brothers\\" compared to Michael Cimino's home-from-war drama \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" but it is a significantly better film. What Cimino brought to \\"Deer Hunter\\" was a naive view of the relationship of five men, resulting in a manipulative melodrama saved only by the pure talent of Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken. Everything in his film seemed to obviously aspire to greatness, like a little boy wearing his father's best suit. \\"Brothers\\" is not young, but mature and well-modulated. Its focus and balance are naturally captivating; unlike \\"Deer Hunter,\\" it has no need to proclaim its greatness. Bier makes her characters deeply involving, her story not manipulative but genuinely effective. What's most amazing, though, is that it is important not because it's programmed to be, but because its characters are so human and the situations so effortlessly devastating that there is no need to push: we connect, feel, and then walk away hoping for change.
B00004RF98|5.0|\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is the crown jewel of the MGM musicals made between 1928 and 1960.  This is not a knock on the wonderful films that Fred Astaire made at MGM and other studio's, not at all, but without a doubt this one is the best synthesis of Broadway Musical and Hollywood extravaganza.  Made in stunning color just in time to keep audiences away from the first wave of TV sets, Hollywood had Gene Kelly tapping down everything he knew about dance into a fun little script about the old transition from 1920's flappers and silents to the new audio age. <br /> <br />It is so much fun to see the contrast between Donald O'Connor, the limber clown, and Gene Kelly the athletic man's man. Their dance is all about thrills and acrobatics, spectacular steps and synchronization.  Add young Debbie Reynolds, and the effect is pure entertainment.  Get up off your couch and start dancing on the dining room table.  Don't scare the wife and kids.   <br /> <br />Much has been said about the sexy Cyd Charisse number.  Her long, long, green stocking legs made the boys uncomfortable in their theatre seats.  I think she was taller than Gene Kelly.  The Freudian, gauze in the wind scene is all about intercourse as much as the sensibilities of 1952 could handle.  It's burlesque, but ballet, or modern dance, combining at a time when Broadway was experimenting; Bob Fosse and others were choreographing the golden age of American stage musical.  <br /> <br />In the end, sentimental, romantic, and ageless, SITR is in the top twenty films ever made. <br />
0156027321|3.0|About half way through Life of Pi, the story begins to pick up: teenager Pi Patel finds himself alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  Up until now we have learned about Pi's childhood and in particular his fascination with religion -- Pi considers himself to be Hindu, Christian, and Muslim.  Whereas leaders from these religions represent Pi's spiritual side, his zookeeper father and his biology teacher represent Pi's rational, scientific side.  The two pieces of Pi become whole as the narrator spends months adjusting tactics in order to remain alive on a small craft with a natural predator. <br /> <br />Pi's story gets more fanciful as it progresses, sometimes just skirting the edge of the reader's suspended disbelief.  We know from the beginning that our narrator survives this ordeal, but it is not until the end that we learn the true meaning of Pi's adventure.  Rare is the ending that pushes the reader to consider what he has just read in a different light; Life of Pi succeeds in this. <br /> <br />Martel takes his time getting to the heart of the story - too long, I would argue.  Part One certainly sets the scene for the adventure to come, is essential in order to understand Martel's greater meaning, and teaches a great deal about animals and zoos to boot.  But if you find yourself slugging through this (as I did at times) and are considering putting the book down, try instead skipping to Part Two, which begins with the jarring, short sentence: \\"The ship sank.\\"  Life of Pi is worth finishing, and it would be a shame to stop early on and miss the better story.
0312263120|2.0|If you are looking for a little escape with minimum brain exertion, then this book is for you.  I read it when I was sick and couldn't concentrate on a more serious literature.  The National Security Agency has to figure out how to break an unbreakable code in order to prevent the USA's classified intelligence from being revealed to the entire world.  The plot was engaging if you are willing to overlook some errors in facts and logic.  One has to remember that this book is a suspense mystery, that is, a fiction, so nobody expects the facts in the book to be true.  The book is designed to be read fast, with little effort and without close scrutiny.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Just like folk music, in its earliest incarnation, needed the Carter family, 60's folk music needed Bob Dylan. Dylan was and is the center by which all other folk artist measure themselves to this day. There is some of his well known social commentary on here which is a bit on heavy side, but still brilliant. My personal favorites are his ballads and humor songs, like Corrina and I shall be free. Dylan simply uses the folk medium for his own indiosynchratic and inspired style. It's really hard to say which of his earliest works is best. Freewheelin is definitely a top contender in this catagory of Mr. Dylan's vast catalog.  <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|I Have been a fan of Green Day for many years and I have to say this is a good cd but i miss the old gd.  The songs St. Jimmy and American Idiot sound like they could have been taken right off of Dookie though the rest of the cd is almost intierly different.  Boulevard of broken dreams was a good song for about the first 1000 times I heard it but now I cant stand it.  Also Are we the waiting just bores me to death i believe this trend of boring songs started with Good riddince and have kept popping up throughout gd albums.  Its not all bad though Jesus of Suburbia is a musical work of art.  I know that its boring for a band to do the same thing over and over but I just desperatly miss the Green Day that made Dookie. I must say i think that it is really cool how they made the whole cd like a story.  Although it is a change it is not bad.  As a music lover I think this cd is great but as a Green Day lover I cant say the same.
B000002UJQ|5.0|u need to listen to it a few times, but once u do, u wont be able to stop listening. Easily their best album.
B00005221M|2.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I just can't bring myself to by it in this \\"expanded\\" director's cut version. My apologies to the director, but we liked your first version better. I have it on VHS, but really want to add the DVD to my collection. But not this DVD. Please put the original version on DVD!!
0316776963|5.0|A wonderful collection of short stories from the author's life told in a way that is almost magical.  If a reader is framiliar with the authors public radio appearances and/or his sister Amy's work (Strangers With Candy, Late Night and Late Show guest, ...) this book will be even more enjoyable.
B0007TKNIS|1.0|Oh lord was this horrible.  The only redeeming feature of this movie was the phantom himself, and that's not to insinuate his acting was by any means extraordinary.  There is one part at the end when Raoul just stands there weeping like a woman while the phantom loosely wraps him in some weak excuse for a noose, and he supposedly can't \\"break\\" free.  Oh boy was this silly.  The only musical rendition of this that could not beat this stupid movie is the one showing in your nine year old's back yard.  NOBODY who has seen this on Broadway and has any sense would claim this even remotely compares in quality.  If this is the best we can come up with than our society is sorely lacking, my friends.
B0001AP12G|5.0|What more can I say. Im surprised some of you are dissing him. <br /> <br />Listen to : <br /> <br />Never Let You Down <br />All falls Down <br />Jesus Walks <br />Breathe in Breath Out <br /> <br />and then tell me if Kanye is not a good artist.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is an awesome album.  I think it is slightly better than their first one.  A great listen!  They sound more like a new band, than two bands just playing together.  Rock on Audioslave!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Wow, I raced out today to get this since I'm a huge fan and there was only one CD left!!! So I said, \\"HOLY CRAP!\\" and grabbed it!  Anyway, I started listening to it in the car and it was sooo good I said, \\"HOLY CRAP!\\" since it was so good.  I loved the catchy tunes.  A week previous I was mezmerized by Mezmerize, but now I'm mesmerized by this sparkeling masterpiece.  \\"HOLY CRAP!\\"  I can't describe this at all.  It's too good for words.  I mean, I can say that it makes me crap my pants it's so good.  Alot of the songs are also like 80's dance songs, but extremely well done.  80's dance music sort of sucks...but this is awsome.  Gorillaz are a sweet band.  And when the last 2 songs tied together at the end I said, \\"HOLY CRAP!\\" <br /> <br />NOTE:  THIS ALBUM DOES NOT HAVE EITHER 19-2000 OR CLINT EASTWOOD IN THE TRACK LISTING, THEREFORE IT'S VERY GOOD AND ORIGINAL. <br /> <br />NOTE #2:  How many versions can you possibly make of a song? <br />19-2000 - 4 versions (one crappy one) <br />Clint Eastwood - 4 versions <br /> <br />Hmm, they're good songs but they're not the second coming if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />Note #3:  BUY THIS CD!!! <br /> <br />\\"HOLY CRAP!\\"
B00097DX3U|4.0|I won't bother reiterating what 35 other reviewers have already said. This is a better and more consistent release than the debut album with tighter, stronger songwriting. But there's one thing that urks me slightly, as I prepare to be flamed: Cornell's vocals sound like they are on the decline. Cornell is one of the best hard rock vocalists ever, and If you've never heard earlier Soundgarden recordings than you might not even notice it, but I find his vocals on this release very inconsistent. Some songs sound like the Cornell of old, while others just sound like Cornell IS old. I don't know if he's deliberately doing it to adopt a new sound to his tone, but he's gotten quite raspy and overly gritty on some of these songs, and he simply sounds like he doesn't have the power he used to or he recorded half these songs after blowing his voice out. (He's starting to sound like Bob Segar!). Cornell in top form could steamroll over a track years ago.(Soundgarden's \\"SuperUnknown\\" album, for example). Granted, he's better than 99% of the rock vocalists out there, but the subtle differences are there and more noticeable than the first release.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I'm a fan of the comics, I've been reading Hellblazer since issue 41 and now it's at issue 208. Needless to say I'm a bit of a purist. Given that most of us Hellblazer readers were pretty upset when this flick was announced, I was surprised that I actually liked this movie!!! It is what it is, far from perfect but a decent 2 hours of entertainment. Keanu isn't as wooden as he's been in other movies and he never utters a single \\"whoa\\". Would I have prefered if the studio had stuck closer to the comic? Of course. But what they gave us didn't turn out that bad.
015204907X|5.0|Sheep are appealing creatures, known for being gentle.  Indeed, our very lexicon includes the expression, \\"gentle as a lamb,\\" so it comes as no suprise that many delightful books for pre-schoolers involve sheep in some form.  The ovine theme works like a charm in this book.  It takes its place among other good ovine literature such as \\"Sherman the Sheep\\" and \\"Sheep in a Jeep.\\"<br /><br />This book does a nice job of blending fact and fantasy.  Sheep are drawn in pastoral settings, happily eating daisies, grass and clovers as well as being anthropormorphized and engaged in human activites such as fixing a car; sleeping in a bed; taking baths and dancing.<br /><br />Young children will find that this book will keep their attention.  The language is clear and direct without overdoing; the point is made right off the bat.  Cognitive concepts such as color, up, down, in and out are included.  One can also interpret the sheep of many colors, blue, red, etc. as being a metaphor for diversity and acceptance.  The Quest for the Green Sheep makes for very humorous reading indeed.<br /><br />The writing, together with the excellent illustrations make for a very nice package indeed.  Regardless of level of degree in matters ovine, readers and listeners alike will enjoy the pure fun of this book.  People of all ages will laugh at the ovine antics and get a charge out of finding out the whereabouts of that green sheep!
0425152251|5.0|I remember when I first heard about philosophy. It was sometimes during my High-school period, and one of the classes we had to tend was philosophy. Our teacher told us which books is necessary for that course, and, of course, we bought it. Sooner or later I started browsing trough that book just to see what it is all about. And of course, the book was about history of philosophy. Though some of my teachers later in life had said that history of philosophy is the philosophy itself, I didn't care much for it back then. All I saw was endless ammount of years, names, places, events, various doctrines which all seemed alike to me, and maybe the most important thing was that book was so poorly written that boredom seeped from it's pages. (for that matter, nothing has changed even today, some of the historical textbooks and various representations still attained their ammount of painful boredom)<br /><br />I will not say: \\"Gee if I had this book back then\\" couse it wouldn't mean a thing. If you put aside the boredom of the textbook, philosophy itself intrigued me quite enoguh, but enough with me. This is the wonderfull book. I'll close on of my eyes and let some flaws in narrative construction pass me by, I will also put by me \\"simplistic\\" view of philosophy. All I want to see, and all you should see is the process that this book is trying to do. It is the process of thinking, having doubts, comparing among doctrines and finding the right path trough them, it teaches development of oneself as the only real way to be happy and succesfull in life. This book teaches one to ask that question that we are all afraid of \\"why?\\"<br /><br />In a world where children literature is nothing but simplistic, almost retarded approach to \\"teen\\" and children inteligence, this book stands high above any other.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|What a riot.  Corny, imaginative, subtle and overt humor...it exceeded my expectations.  I didn't figure it would be as good as Shrek; I was mistaken.  This had Simpson-like humor with an even faster pace.  You must be paying attention to catch all the innuendo.  This will be a must buy DVD so I can see it again for the first time.
B000068CNX|5.0|Season 2 was the peak of the media frenzy that caused what is now known as the backlash years. They've became so overexposed with the diet coke commercials, the theme song, magazine covers everywhere. But there is no doubt that Season 2 is a strong season. This is also probably the peak of Chandler and Joey as best buds which wass one of my favorite running storylines of the series. And not o mention the much awaited Ross and Rachel hookup. Elsewhere this is also the genesis of Monica and Richard's (Tom Selleck) romance and also the start of Phoebe's storylines about her family.     Standout episodes are TOW the Ross New Girlfriend (The best season opener of the series, all three storylines were memorable, Aniston was especially good and hilarious), Tow the baby on the Bus (Kudrow, Perry, and Le blanc were all magnificent here), Tow the List (Aniston and Schwimmer were the standout here especially towards the end), Tow the Prom Video (one of my all time favorite episodes, everything about this episode screams CLASSIC), TOW Ross Finds Out (another Schwimmer and Aniston classic especially their historic first big fight and first real kiss), TOW the Two Parties, TOW Eddie Moves In, TOW Joey Moves Out (Cox was the standout here), and TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding (probably the most low key finale of the series)    I have to talk more about TOW the Prom Video, the best episode of the season. I love that at the start it seemed like a regular episode until it reached towards the end where we know this isn't just a regular episode. This is destined to become a classic. Everything about this episode is memorable from the performances, to the one-liners (\\"How many cameras are actually on you?\\" \\"I think I'm ready for my (...) now\\") to the debut of Fat Monica and Ross afro, to Chandler's bracelet to Phoebe's lobster theory and of course the fact that Ross and Rachel are officially together.     Grade: A
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I must say the tracks for this album is not bad at all. <br /> <br />Gave it 3 stars for the following reasons: <br /> <br />Pros <br />-Sounds/voice are perfect if your the average system of a down fan. Sounds were wonderful! <br /> <br />Cons <br />-Poor Lyrics <br />-They go way over board with political views. Way too much for me to listen to when you have family over there in the mid east fighting.
B000050FEN|5.0|One of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The characters and images from the film stayed with me longer than I wanted. I mean that in a good and creepy way.  <br /> <br />I very much like the storytelling style, we get to see in different emphasis and length all the seven deadly sins performed by the serial killer as his modus operandi, Some are visually grotesque, others psychologically disturbing and others both. I was especially disturbed with the \\"lust\\" part, it wasn't exactly visually shown but just the way it was explained and said was just unthinkable. And of course the ending which was the culmination of the performed seven deadly sins was just unbelievably terrifying. It's creepy in the psychological and spiritual way because just when you thought it's just a run of the mill serial killer's acts, there's a disturbing rationalization for that acts. Really disturbing, I can't say that word enough   <br /> <br />The atmosphere of the film was also a strength of the film, it has a gritty and simplistic approach to how the movie is going to look like. And the result is an elegant and un-Hollywood look for the film. The chaotic and impersonal nature of the city as a backdrop provided a strong mood for the lonely and disillusioned characters in this film. I think it was brilliantly setuped and designed. <br /> <br />Even though this movie is too popular to be a cult classic, but also not too popular with regard to critical acclaim and awards unlike Silence of the Lambs, that's why I personally think it's underappreciated. This movie is an intelligent and thought-provoking thriller that deserves to be regarded in the same breath as the great thrillers of all time.  <br /> <br />Grade: A
B0008ISM40|5.0|It's so good to have NIN back. <br />I;ve listened the entire album for 3 times and it's still amazing me. <br />There are so many bands that have been influenced by NIN like TOOL,Linkin Park, etc... that we allways expect something new and different from Trent Reznor. <br />With TEETH is a complete different album from the others NIN's works but it still have the NIN essence. <br />For me The best song in the album is \\"Beside you in time\\". <br />I'ts a masterpiece and i see the Future of NIN there. <br />NINE INCH NAILS NO TE ME MUERAS NUNCA <br />
6305537321|5.0|For me this is the film that captures Audrey Hepburn's legendary career. Some people may push for My Fair Lady (but her singing voice wasn't used in the movie so it's hard to argue its definitiveness, besides it's more associated with Julie Andrews) or Roman Holiday (her only Academy Award win), but I am whole-heartedly for Breakfast at Tiffany's because everything about the movie captures the magic that is Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />When I first saw the first scene of the movie which was Hepburn having breakfast at a still closed Tiffany's with the score of Moon River in the backgroud, it already had me. There's something about the melancholic atmosphere of the beginning credits that captured the loneliness of Holly Golightly. This is one of the most memorable opening credits ever, and no single word was even uttered.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn may not be regarded in the same breath as Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn in terms of acting, but only Audrey Hepburn can combine charm, effervescence, vulnerability, and heartbreaking tenderness into her roles particularly in this one, she is an acting goddess in her own right.<br /><br />Grade:A
B0008G2IRO|2.0|Where's Miho Hatori?! <br />Two listens now, and I think I'm done. <br />Do not bother buying this expanded edition with DVD, it is an absolute waste. <br />The first time i listened to the Gorillaz, I became excited, that some one was doing something new, catchy, and smart. <br />This cd bores me so far, and I will try to listen to it again. <br />Go to their website, and become as lost as I find myself now trying to describe my disappointment.
0790731509|5.0|There's a line in the movie Ordinary People that I can't help but associate with this movie, to paraphrase it, it's something like don't idolize someone too much, cause it'll disappoint you. Luke (Newman) was somehow in that situation he's become such a hero to the other prisoners that he can't disappoint them. Even when he told the truth about the fake photo and the final escape (you've got to watch it for context), they turn it into something that will support their \\"hero\\" fantasy. In short they're into the image and not the person. In Luke's darkest hour they all left him, somehow implying their shallow relationship.  <br /> <br /> The character Luke is enigmatic, it's really hard to tell with certainty why he is the way he is. Paul Newman embodied the role perfectly, this might be his most beloved role of his career probably even more than Butch Cassidy and \\"Fast\\" Eddie Felson. Paul Newman exhibited great range as an actor, he got to be this really intense guy and then play the \\"cool\\" guy and then he's got  to be really quietly moving without making any big acting dramatics. He is truly one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> There are lots of great moments particularly the now famous and infamous \\"egg-eating contest\\". Or how about the numerous attempts of Luke to get out of jail and then eventually recaptured. The big fight between Dragline and Luke and then tragic finale of the film. There are so many great moments in this film and I just hope the DVD will be re-released. How cool it would be to have a Paul Newman commentary!  <br /> <br />Grade: A
0385336810|5.0|This book was one of the most enjoyable books i have ever read! I found this book to be hilarious, romantic and at some times mysterious. How the auther portrayed the character of Emma Coragin was so detailed that i couldn't put it down. I have re-read this book 3 times after I purchased it, and each time I was satisfied. Definatly a 5 star book to me!
B00097DX3U|4.0|I have been looking foward to this record for almost three months know and am glad to say I was not disappointed. While much different then their self titled release it has a strength all its own. The band has found a style of its own seperate form Rage and Soungarden and it shows in songs like, \\"Out of Exile\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\". If you want to compare the two records Out of Exile is the light side to their self titled Audioslave. All of the songs are great in their own way but my favorites are \\"Out of Exile\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\",\\"Heaven's Dead\\". Anyone who complains that this record is to soft just wants the band to stay stuck in the mold Audioslave
0385504209|1.0|The characters are predictable one dimensional cartoons, the good guys are the atheist tree hugging narcissistic pagans, the bad guys include a very pale man who believes in God; the hedonistic oh-so-witty and sophisticated heroes manage to have the upper hand at every turn so there is zero suspense once you catch on to his technique. This book is just not very good fiction plain and simple. Pass on this [...]. Go waste your money on something [...] fattening, but please do not encourage the dumming down of the reading public.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Ditch the pop music on side one. Track 1,2,3. Now let's hear some music! Anyone that can honestly say they love music can NOT turn off the infectious sound of Zanzabar. Now we have Rosalinda's eyes (a song that my children have learned to love thru listening to vinyl on those nice eveninigs with a bbq and friends) one of the best song that Billy ever wrote. What can I say about Stillitto, other than perfect? Buy this album get thru the usual hit machine  Pop music and enjoy a great adult comtempory sound.
B000003BDJ|4.0|I'm not a huge Rolling Stones fan, but I do like a number of their songs very much, so I bought this greatest hits compilation and played it so much that the tape broke.  Naturally, I then bought the CD.  Highly recommend - even for the casual Stones fan like myself.
B000000OSE|5.0|The \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums are one of the most ambitious albums in history, and perhaps the number one most ambitious rock album. No one had ever before released two separate albums at the same time, let alone two sprawling epics at 76 minutes apiece. It was a bold, daring and dangerous move, but ultimately a resounding success. <br /> <br />\\"Use Your Illusion I\\" - probably unintentionally - rocks harder than its twin, and it was a good effort to match the brilliant \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" A good effort, but not good enough. Some of the songs on this record are as good or better than some on AFD: \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" are as good as \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" etc. But AFD was a better record overall, with zero filler, and in fact every song was a giant. UYI1 doesn't manage that, but comes close. <br /> <br />It kicks off with \\"Right Next Door to Hell,\\" a short, fast-paced rocker with an AFD flavor. Some of Izzy's best are on this album, and \\"Dust N' Bones,\\" a bluesy Stones-esque track is one of the finest. \\"Live and Let Die\\" is a good Stones cover, but overrated.  <br /> <br />\\"Don't Cry\\" is one of the best power ballads ever done, although at times the lyrics are watery. The solo is an asskicker, strong and hard, forceful even though it's not fast. The finale is great, even the neverending \\"toniiiiiiiiiight.\\" \\"Perfect Crime\\" is short and sweet, hard rock rolling along at a breakneck speed. Izzy's amusing \\"You Ain't the First\\" tempers the last song's fury with a little acoustic goodbye. \\"Bad Obsession\\" is one of Axl's deep-voiced tracks, another strong one. \\"Back Off Bitch\\" boasts a ripper of a solo from slash, although some of the lyrics are less than inspiring. Izzy and Duff are awesome in \\"Double Talkin' Jive,\\" not to mention Slash's exhibition of guitar perfection at the end. <br /> <br />\\"November Rain\\" is probably the best song on the album, with an orchestral background, a good piano part and some of the most awesome riffs ever.The finale is incredible, too, and doesn't seem like an attempt to make the song longer or harder. It isn't. The lyrics are fantastic, not sappy, but a powerful message: that sometimes you have to walk away when it's raining too hard, but nothing lasts forever. If you hold one, everything will be all right. <br /> <br />\\"The Garden\\" is a bizarre but brilliant song, with a behind bane solo by Slash, and abrupt changes in tempo and style, from soft guitar strums to hard and heavy rock. \\"Garden of Eden\\" is one of the best songs, and really seems to carry on the AFD spirit, though it's actually far faster than any of the debut album's songs. Short and very, very fast, all brought together by some brilliant Slash riffs. \\"Don't Damn Me\\" is again, one of the album's highlights, fast, beautiful solo, and the some of Axl's cleverest, truest and downright jawdropping lyrics. A magnificent song. <br /> <br />\\"Bad Apples\\" is another great song, with a great solo and very good lyrics. \\"Dead Horse\\" is awesome, but the throat-shredding screams that kick in a bit later on are overdone. <br /> <br />\\"Coma\\" is a monster. Slash is absolutely at the pinnacle here, and so is Axl, vocally diverse and lyrically superb. The long, long final verse is one of the best endings to an album and a song that you'll ever hear, on par with \\"Rocket Queen.\\" It's a giant that has all the members of GNR apparently showing off. <br /> <br />All in all, UYI1 is one of the best rock albums ever, and is a worthy follow-up to \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" if not quite as good. Some of the material here is Guns N' Roses' best, but some is simply very very good. That's the scale: very good to classic. It doesn't get much better than \\"Use Your Illusion I.\\"
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This movie is my favorite, along with fight club and trainspotting. while reading some of the reviews, i saw how many people thought the revelation of penn's daughter's murder was lame. this movie was not a mystery. dont go into this movie expecting a mystery. sure, the movie is built around a mystery, but it is far from the regular cops and robbers plot you may see on TV. this movie is about the characters. its about penn's battle with his criminal past (and future), robbins' tragic portrayal of a man sexually molested as a boy, harding's decision to do the right thing (or what she thinks is the right thing). this movie is far from a mystery, so don't review it as if it were one.
B00003CXCT|1.0|NOTE: this review encompasses all six movies <br /> <br />A 37 year old child has died. The cause of death was the same thing that had unnaturally prolonged childhood an additional 28 years: Star Wars. The victim was a husband, father of three and a huge Star Wars geek. Don't weep for him, for he is me and although my geek-side has died, I have been resurrected. I guess you could say that now I am truly, finally, an adult. <br /> <br />So what happened? How did my undying love for Star Wars die? How does a man go from the joy of spending most of his life and disposable income on Star Wars toys, clothes, cards, conventions, magazines, videos, digitally enhanced videos, extended version DVDs and countless movie tickets to a dead feeling at the center of his soul? How does a man go from standing in line for three hours in the freezing rain waiting to get into Celebration III (humming the Ewok song like a Buddhist monk chanting to keep his mind from despair) to wanting to sell every Star Wars-related item in his home? How does a man achieve total Nerd-vana, then turn his back on it? It is quite a task to murder such enthusiasm and as such, it took the concerted effort of three highly trained assassins armed with the latest technology and gadgets. The assassins were Episode I, Episode II and Episode III. <br /> <br />Step away from the keyboard, fan-boy. I am not a prequel hater whose childhood was raped by George Lucas. Heck, I even find a great deal of merit in Jar Jar Binks. The prequels are great science fiction/fantasy movies filled with incredible sights, sounds and fully rendered worlds of amazing depth and imagination. But for all the wonders we are blessed with on the silver screen, none of these films are really Star Wars. Throughout every viewing of these films and trust me, there were many, I couldn't shake an inchoate sense that something wasn't quite right. I liked the Gungan/Droid battle and Darth Maul opened a terrific can of Sith whoopass on the Jedi, but for all that, something was nagging at me that this wasn't right. My brain was trying to tell me that George Lucas was off track, but my heart wouldn't listen. What was he up to? Why is he introducing all these new characters instead of focusing on the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker? Surely he must have some master plan that would all be wrapped up neatly in Episode III? So I sat dutifully through the childish fart jokes in Episode I and the egregiously awful Anakin/Padme' love scenes in Episode II in order to get to the big payoff of Episode III. Like a brainwashed religious zealot, I kept the faith that my cult-leader Lucas would lead us into the promised Star Wars paradise. And then the veil dropped and revealed nothing more than a painted straw man. <br /> <br />My fellow friends and geeks, I am not here to tell you that Episode III was a bad film. It wasn't. It was quite a good film actually. In fact, of all six films, this would be in the top three. It had a great story, exciting action sequences, state of the art special effects, satisfying battles and well-developed characters. It was well-edited and fast paced; a perfect popcorn movie. Lucas kept the story focused on the main characters and pushed the secondary characters to the edge of the film. Jar Jar is only in two brief scenes and he is only seen and never heard. Great, right? Wrong. Wrong. Stupendously wrong! As a stand alone film, Revenge of the Sith is superb. But it cannot be a stand alone film. It is part of a trilogy. It is the payoff and reward for our loyalty to the series and patience of sitting through two other films and waiting 6 years for this one. It is the reward for 28 years dreaming and imagining the legendary light saber duel on the lava planet and the birth of Darth Vader. Was the reward worth the effort? Well, let's hear from the master himself. This is how he rewards loyalty and devotion: <br /> <br />\\"Now he [George Lucas] volunteers that his prequel story line-derived from material he brainstormed over 30 years ago to inform his writing of Star Wars-was `thin'...'It was not written as a movie. It's basically a character study and exhibition piece about politics-two things that are not dramatic. [Not like] the dramatic story that was constructed for Star Wars. But I wanted to be faithful to it, so I didn't construct other stories. It is what it is...This is the story. I know I'm going to need to use Hamburger Helper to get it to two hours, but that's what I want to do.' By Lucas' own calculations, 60 percent of the prequel plot he dreamed up decades earlier takes place in Sith. The remaining 40 percent he split evenly between Menace and Clones, meaning each film contained lots of...filler.\\" <br />--Entertainment Weekly, #820, May 20, 2005 <br /> <br />\\"Filler\\", \\"hamburger helper\\". That is our reward my fellow geeks and fanboys. By Lucas' own calculations, Episode I and Episode II were 20 percent story arc and 80 percent filler. Filler that by Lucas' own admission was not \\"written as a movie\\". Digest that for a moment. Do you feel used? Unappreciated? Is your love unrequited? I feel the hate in you. Let it go, release your anger and your journey to the Dark Side will be complete. George Lucas has been writing about Sith Lords for so long that he has become one. His reward to us for our decades of unfettered loyalty and devotion was betrayal by \\"filler\\". My love for Star Wars went into a coma after viewing Revenge of the Sith. After reading that interview, the feeding tube was removed and my Star Wars fueled adolescence finally passed away quietly in its sleep. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM
B00009L1TA|4.0|I thought Travolta's part was a little overdone.  However, the movie has no dull moments and a great ending that completely surprised me.  Something that you don't see too much these days.
B00097DX3U|4.0|This album is cool. Tom and Tim really shine on <br />this CD. Some songs, Tom is really, really out their on <br />solos. Brad's drumming is alot more solid as compared <br />to the first album. Chris is singing more than <br />screeching on the first album (more like Soundgarden). After <br />listening to it a few times, it has grown on me. It's nice to hear them play songs that actually go somewhere, i.e. chords and progression. The first album seemed like an expierment leading to  \\"Out of Exile\\". Hopefully, this album will grow on you too. I am  <br />hoping for a live CD with the boys digging into their earlier <br />catalogs (playing RATM and S.G. songs on tour).
B00006LLJ4|4.0|My collection of action packed films is growing.  I watch them when I am on the treadmill and the time flies by.  Since this is a cross between action and dialogue, there were parts that seemed slow, probably because it made me glance down at my distance, speed and calories burned!  However, if you are a Tom Cruise fan, you will enjoy this movie whether or not you like the plot.
0778320448|5.0|This book is absolutely delightful!  The characters are very <br />real, appealing & most of us can identify easily with each of <br />them.  I would recommend this book to every reader & have bought <br />more copies for gifts.  READ IT!!!
B00097DX3U|5.0|Chris Cornell's vocal ability is still intact.  Excellent disc!! It has been a couple of years since the debut of Audioslave.  Rage and Chris Cornell?  That doesn't seem like it sounds right; however, the debut proved me that they had their own sound.  The second release 'out of exile' is even better than their first. This band has evolved since than and seem to find a comfortable place feeling the vibe. Songs like 'out of exile', and 'be yourself' are personal favorites.  One of the best rock cds I've heard in a real long time.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Bad adaptation to the great comic book called Hellblazer has probably the worse actor imaginable playing the title role. Keanu Reeves is with out a shadow of a doubt miscast in the title role and makes a fool out of himself and almost everyone in the movie. The script is an incoherent mess and the direction from first time director Frances Lawrence is lackluster to say the least. Of all the actors involved, Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou are able to give their best to their underwritten characters. Weisz gives a strong and determine performance and Hounsou does more with a throwaway role than Keanu does as the lead. The rest of the actors involved are almost as bad as Reeves himself with Shia LaBeouf being as annoying as ever and Peter Stormare over doing it as the prince of darkness. <br /> <br />Say what you may about the Blade films but at least the first two Blade movies had a script that at least entertain you for a good solid two hours while this film will have you looking at your watch after the first 45 minutes.  IF you like to see bad movies then be my guess, if not avoid.  <br />
B0008G2IRO|4.0|Rating: B+ <br />ALthough I never really got hooked on the Gorillaz first effort, I must honestly say that this record has some of the catchiest and well thought out beats and lyrics to be released so far this year. This is probably my second favorite hip-hop experimental album this year, right up there with Lyric's Born's: Same S#it, Different Day, although this album is more of a fusion of the gap bridging between rock and rap, as DJ Danger Mouse, now notorious for the Gray Album takes center stage with some tight slinky-like beats that work their way through the song and in and out of your ears with the slightest of ease. A very chilled out laid back album with my favorite tracks probably being Last Living Souls, and the oh so addicting radio single Feel Good Inc., you just gotta love that damn hook. By the way, while your picking up this great album, make sure you're picking up the special deluxe edition which come with a DVD loaded with extras and a couple extra tracks. Not only that but the overall packaging is top notch, as the artwork loaded up in here is well thought out, and it'll just make ya smile to see what this band has done as you open up your package. Well the boys have done it again, enjoy it I know I will.
B00097DX3U|4.0|A much better effort. <br />The self-titled album consisted of RATM tracks with Cornell's vocals about drug addiction, which got boring after a few listens, and simply made me want to listen to RATM and Soundgarden respectively. <br />This time around the band is clicking. There's strange similarities in song structure with Led Zeppelin, and I swear that one of the tracks sounds like it could have been written by U2 - but overall, the album is much better than the original and more indicative of what these guys are capable of.<br />It's not perfect though. Almost all the songs follow the same basic formula: Intro, power chords, chorus, Morello indulging in effects, repeat. But hell, that's why I listen to it - sometimes it's good to breakaway from more complex and artsy music and just indulge.<br />Keep in mind that it's stadium rock and that you're supposed to have fun listening to it. Don't expect genius or mind, in fact, don't expect anything. Just listen pop it in and have a good time.
1570629706|5.0|As I read this book, (it took me about an hour and a half,) I kept thinking about how similar it is to THE ALCHEMIST by Paolo Coehlo.  Lots of the same messages: follow your heart, seek enlightenment, be yourself, learn about love, among others.  The reason I like this book better is simple.  It came out first.  I'd venture to say it was some kind of inspiration for THE ALCHEMIST.  This book leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth, and is a must read for anyone who may feel lost or out of touch with themselves.  I loved it.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|For some reason I have a bad habit of never following up on sequels until years later.  It's a flaw that occurs when I like something, but not quite enough to wait in lines at theaters or reserve copies at a rental store when I'm never quite sure of my schedule.  The Matrix falls into that category, very well done and imaginative, no doubt, but it didn't stir me enough to rush to see the sequels.<br /><br />Now I've seen Reloaded, and I continue to be impressed, not so much by the raw imagination of Matrix, but by it's ability to skirt the obvious paradigms that the viewer expects and hare off instead in entirely new directions.  Of course, the wild chases and fight scenes are here in all their glory.  At a certain point, they actually become abstract and tedious extravaganzas.  The Wachowski's put everything they can into Neo's acrobatics, coming closer and closer to a bloodbath that never actually happens.  Unfortunately this means stretching them out until they cry for editing.<br /><br />In spite of all this showmanship, it is the plot and characters that really make this film.  Neo struggles to discover what he needs to do Morpheus seeks after the Oracle, and a whirl of voice enhance characters sweep across the screen like Dune revisited.  New characters like Merovingian and Persephone liven things up.  And Agent Smith turns into a cast of thousands all by himself.<br /><br />Doom is descending to destroy Zion, and Neo must decide what is important, what is real, what is maze, and what is purpose.  Zion itself comes to life beautifully, and we finally get an understanding of how this culture of rebels really works.  My only irritation is that the film ends in a total cliffhanger, which somehow smacks of cheating.  I mean, I would have gotten to Matrix Revolutions sooner or later anyway.
B000002H33|5.0|...This is Metallica's real deal here. They have created the best heavy metal album known to man! This is an absolute masterpiece. You will never need to press the pesky little skip-track button on your CD-player. If you just want more of this too, get Ride the Lightning with it. This is also the last album with one of the greatest, Cliff Burton(R.I.P.). Tracks like Orion and For Whom The Bell Tolls(from \\"Ride the Lightning\\") show his greatest work. BREAKDOWN!: <br /> <br />1. Battery - Great acoustic intro leading into the raw powerfullness. (10/10) <br /> <br />2. Master Of Puppets - One of their most famous songs. Similar to Battery. Great transition from thrashy to a little bit softer. (10/10) <br /> <br />3. The Thing That Should Not Be - One of my favorites. Great tempo and beat. (9/10) <br /> <br />4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - Hetfield's best lyrics ever. (10/10) <br /> <br />5. Disposable Heroes -  Not much to say. Really thrashy and another great one. (8/10) <br /> <br />6. Leper Messiah - Really great song with a good beat. If I am skipping around the CD (rare), this is one of the first songs that I play and one of my favorites of all time. (10/10) <br /> <br />7. Orion - Ahhhhh! Here it is. Argubly their best instrumental ever. Personally I can't decide between this and The Call of Ktulu(from Ride the Lightning). Features a short solo from the bass legend Cliff Burton (R.I.P.). (10/10) <br /> <br />8. Damage Inc. - Another popular and fantasic song. Argubly the best track on the album to some. (10/10) <br /> <br />So do what the title says. There is a reason why this is the best-selling heavy metal album of all time.
B00003CX9E|5.0|What can one add to what's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time?  \\"Citizen Kane\\" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the making of the film is as interesting as the movie itself.  It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the 1995 documentary, \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane.\\" <br /> <br />Despite \\"Kane's\\" continued status as \\"greatest film ever,\\" I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who haven't seen it, or worse yet, who watched it only once and thought it was just OK.  Believe me: seeing it once is simply not enough!  This is true of any great film, but more so for \\"Kane,\\" which contains countless layers, subtexts, and details that are simply impossible to absorb the first time.  In many ways, \\"Kane\\" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it. <br /> <br />Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks.  Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry.  Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.  <br /> <br />The bonus documentary, \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane,\\" is expertly produced, but belabors the comparison between the careers of Hearst and Welles.  Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter.  By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles didn't accomplish much after \\"Kane,\\" the documentary unfairly simplifies Welles' career.  Welles made several great films of the course of his career, two of which (1958's \\"Touch of Evil\\" and 1966's \\"Chimes at Midnight\\") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to \\"Kane.\\" <br /> <br />The greatest movie of all time?  Quite possibly, though I believe that \\"Touch of Evil\\" is even better among Welles' own films.  But \\"Kane\\" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. \\"Citizen Kane\\" has topped the \\"Sight and Sound\\" critics' and directors' polls since 1962, and its #1 status was reinforced yet again in 1998's American Film Institute Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong?  Watch \\"Citizen Kane\\" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself.
1401301010|4.0|This book really grabbed me. Kiedis is a good story teller and has had a very interesting life. Its filled with a bit of overkill when it comes to the drug/sex life of Kiedis since this really doesn't break new ground when it comes to \\"rock star\\" books. What makes the book so interesting is how his childhood really set him on a course of destruction that would have led most people to a place of no return. Yet he somehow comes through it, stays in touch with his own failings and never lets go of the joy of life. I think what really carries the story is that Anthony is a likeable person that has done some unlikeable things and many people can identify with that. I would have liked him to expand more on his relationship with Flea. I would have also been nice if he had talked more about his feelings as the band grew in popularity. Overall this is a quick, enjoyable read.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Forget \\"Gone with The Wind\\". This is the greatest movie ever made. And this special edition comes close to encapsulating it. There are, as usual, some gripes to be had. But the overall package is impressive.<br /><br />In 1963, the world had just lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, and nuclear one-upsmanship was a pressinc concern. The overwhelmind seriousness of atomic war was almost too much to take on a serious level. So leave it to Stanley Kubrick and Terry Southern to approach the subject in an unusual way: the End of The World as Comedy. The most surprising thing is, it worked.<br /><br />The film runs roughshod over the prevailing notions of US-Russia relations during the Cold War, and the nuclear preparedness of both countries in the event one should strike. Its plot is probably well-known to even the new viewers at this point, so I'll just disect the DVD package here.<br /><br />The film is presented in letterboxing or widescreen format, a move which seems to restore the movie to its original aspect ratio. There are probably some details lost in the frame because of this, but the widescreen is not so obvious that it distracts the viewer.<br /><br />The supplementary features include those already on a previous \\"special editon\\", but also have brand-new documentaries on the performances of Peter Sellers and the actual nuclear threat that inspired \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" which are illuminating and worth watching.<br /><br />My only complaint (and this is minor) is that there is no commentary. Obviously Kubrick can't do that (he passed away in 1999), but one would think there are a wide number of estimable film critics who could offer a commentary. Someone like Roger Ebert or Richard Schickel could easily have made an effort to discuss the movie as it is shown. Maybe it's just that I like commentaries from the filmmakers or (barring that) critics, but I think a true \\"special edition\\" could have made do with a commentary discussion of the film as it is shown.<br /><br />All in all, this is the best movie ever made. It's certainly one of the funniest, and the best depiction of the kind of paranoia that controlled the Cold War and allowed it to get to the brink of destruction in 1962. So get this special edition even if it hairlips everybody on Bear Creek. It wouldn't sap your precious bodily fluids to do so.hown. <br /> <br />All in all, this is the best movie ever made.

B0007QJ1MK|2.0|This was bound to happen. After the brilliant \\"Songs for the deaf\\" they release \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\". Why do I say \\"they\\"? There is no \\"They\\" anymore. There's only Josh Homme with some session-musicians. Songs for the deaf had Nick Olivieri, Mark Lanegan and Dave \\"bleepin'\\" Grohl! Nick Olivieri's absence takes away their edge, Mark Lanegan only sings the intro, and well the new drummer is NO DAVE GROHL!!!  <br />The sound leans toward the Debut album. But it's not as good as the debut album either.  <br /> <br />I think it could have been a lot better if only Nick had stayed, I mean everyone knew Grohl & Lanegan wouldn't stay permanently. But losing Olivieri? He gave them that edge. Homme is more of a \\"tripper\\". As we can hear on this album. Still I like the single \\"Little Sister\\" and there are more catchy tunes here. But it should have been credited as a Josh Homme solo album.
B000002LKU|5.0|I was given this tape about 14 years ago by a mate I used to work with. The first song I listened to was 'Feel like going home'. A friend of mine had passed away the previous week, and the song's melancholy lyrics and feel immediately touched my heart. The rest of the album, especially 'Railroad Song' is also very good. I cannot put my finger on the magic thing this album has, but all the songs match up to a complete experience. Definitely a must buy. And this coming from a hard-core heavy metal fan... simply brilliant. I buy another copy of the CD to give to my friends everytime to give a gift and I want to show that I respect them, and want to show my feelings for them. BUY IT NOW!
B0000542D2|5.0|Having read some of the previous reviews, I'm going to cut against the grain and review this DVD based on the content of the movie and not all the technical aspects.  Since I was one year old when The Beatles called it quits, I might be a little jaded in my opinions as a fan.  Am I a true Beatlemaniac?  Well...obviously not as much as those who are sitting around measurine DB levels and bitching about aspect ratios.  Did I grow up with The Beatles as a musical influence in my life.  Yes.  Do I have a tattoo of Ringo anywhere on my body?  Sorry, Mr. Starkey, but that answer to that is no.  Anyway...let's talk movie talk and let the hardcore fanatics stew a little in the background.  Is this movie hysterical.  Yes.  The first time I saw this movie years ago it became one of my personal favorites instantly.  The humor here is genius.  The plot is thin...but who gives a sh*t.  This movie was a vehicle for bringing The Fab Four to the silver screen and it served its purpose.  Love it for what it is.  A great flick to pop in and unwind to.  Are you a Mod or a Rocker.  I'm a Mocker.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, and there aren't many recently I can say that about. I haven't read the Hellblazer comics so I don't have to struggle with loyalty to cannon, I understand how deviations can be irriating, but just on its own merits I found Constantine to be greatly entertaining. It gets 5 stars because it is the only movie I've seen in the theatre in the last 6 months I  didn't regret paying for.
B000000OAL|3.0|Queen (1973.), Queen's first studio album<br /><br />'Queen', Queen's self titled debut studio album, released in 1973 was the beginning effort from one of the most popular rock bands of all time. Queen's contribution to music has been immense and over the almost 20 years period they produced music before the sad loss of Freddie Mercury in 1991, the band pushed their limits constantly. This initial debut is one of Queen's forgotten albums, namely because it contains less memorable material that casual listeners will simply not be aware of. Afterall, not one track from this album appears on Queen's Greatest Hits Vol. 1, a compilation which many are familiar with. So, does Queen's first album bash deserve more credit than it is given?<br /><br />My answer to that question would be that it certainly deserves to be noticed much more, afterall this is where Queen's career started and plenty of styles which Queen adopted on later classic albums like 'A Night at the Opera' are rooted in this debut effort. However, I would not say this was an overly underrated record. True, the music has great potential on the album and the ideas are great but the album seems to lack genuine consistency overall. There are plenty of tracks on the album which seem to not have any particular direction to them. As a listener, you just settle into one theme on a track before there is an abrupt transition. I'm sounding quite harsh here, afterall, there have been many bands whose debuts are just as wild, raw and unrefined at the edges and it is no bad thing to start that way. Queen's sound on this album is quite hard rock sounding and the album certainly would make a case as being Queen's heaviest album. They are very much a 70's classic rock act at this time, though they do have that characteristic theatrical/operatic style to them even from the start. Therefore there's plenty of guitar presence on the album and Brian May shows us how good a guitarist he really is and you can hear the potential in his playing. Similarly, Freddie Mercury uses his incredible vocal range from the very start and he gives the tracks real character. On Queen's debut, the musicianship is excellent, its just the songwriting and track direction that's at fault really.<br /><br />Still however, the Queen sound is evident from track one. 'Keep Yourself Alive' is an opener with plenty of whirling guitar play from Brian May with plenty of powerful chords thrown in. This is one of the stronger tracks on the album, a little inconsistent in parts though. 'Doing All Right' is similar, the ideas are good with some emotional singing from Freddie Mercury with a great piano part but the middle section of the track goes off at a bit of a tangent sadly, before settling down to the initial theme again. 'Great King Rat' is a much stronger track with lots of heavy guitar play, strong vocals and some creative drumming from Roger Taylor. 'My Fairy King' is not bad, with lots of piano guitar integration again. 'Liar' is the best track on the album in my opinion, a great drumming opener which builds into a six minute epic with a heavy voice 'Liar! Liar!' chorus. 'The Night Comes Down' is a pacier track with plenty of ideas which work loosely. Following this is a short track 'Modern Times Rock n' Roll', some great guitar work with a real rocking style. 'Son and Daughter' is a good rocking track but the track that follows it, 'Jesus', is really awful. I'm not anti-religion or anything but I'm not a fan of Christian lyrics to rock/metal, the song just has no substance to it. 'Seven Seas of Rhye' closes the album. This is a Queen classic however, on the album we only have a one minute demo with no vocals because the band couldn't develop it fully in time for the album's release - I would have perhaps given the album 4 stars if this track was on in full, however, I'm content that its ideas are on the album at least!<br /><br />Queen are a great band no question, however their debut effort leaves a lot to bedesired as it is quite inconsistent (even if there are 1 or 2 good tracks on there). The band were 4 great musicians and you can hear the potential on this album. Any fan of Queen will enjoy this album, especially from the point of view of hearing the band in their early days before widespread fame. Overall though, if your not a massive Queen fan I would stave off this work until you've aquired some of their classic material like 'A Night at the Opera' and 'News of the World'.ent (even if there are 1 or 2 good tracks on there).

B000021YQV|5.0|I got System of a Down's self-titled debut about a month ago and I LOVED IT! At the time, it was my favorite CD of all time. I think it still is, but Toxicity comes close to beating it.<br /><br />  Toxicity is much more commercial than their debut. If you listen to a metal or hard rock radio station, you are likely to hear Toxicity, Aerials or Chop Suey!. That doesn't make this album bad, it just kind of wares out those songs. But, the radio can't ruin System of a Down. My favorite band releases another winner with Toxicity.<br /><br />  I'll rate each song one by one on a scale of 1 to 10.<br /><br />1= horrible song, deserves to be burned<br /><br />10= AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />1. Prison Song- Toxicity is a lot more melodic than \\"System of a Down.\\" But this song isn't. Listening to this song makes you think this album is going to be like their first CD, but it's not. This is the hardest song on the CD. And it's the best. Although the lyrics aren't the best (They're trying to build a prison, they're trying to build a prison, they're trying to build a prison, for you and me, another prison system, another prison system, another prison system, for you and me.), the music is great and Serj Tankian (vocals for SOAD) sings fast and great. Necessity.<br /><br />Rating: 11/10 (off the charts)<br /><br />2. Needles:  This song is pretty good. Although it's not near as good as Prison Song before it and barely not as good as Deer Dance after it, it's still good. The lyrics are much better than the Prison Song lyrics and the music is still really good. Awesome, but there's better.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10<br /><br />3. Deer Dance: This is a GREAT song. The lyrics to the chorus are awesome and the music is also good. This is a great song, but unfortunately it's followed up by...<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />4. Jet Pilot: Usually, I like really really hard songs like this one, but this is just annoying. Half of the lyrics to the song are \\"Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot, one that smiled when he flew over the bay.\\" They say that at least 50 times, and it gets IRRITATING AS HECK. Just filler.<br /><br />Rating: 6/10<br /><br />5. X- All \\"X\\" is is filler just like Jet Pilot, only not as hard and not as oogd. Just like the horse lyrics on Jet Pilot, on this song, they say \\"We don't need to multiply.\\" That sentence is said a lot and it's just as irritating.<br /><br />Rating: 5/10<br /><br />6. Chop Suey!- YES! After two crap songs, System of a Down prove themselves once again with a great song that you've probably heard before on the radio. This song is about suicide, Jesus and many other things. The first single off of this CD, and I know why.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />7. Bounce- Although I hate Jet Pilot and X because they say the same line over and over and over, I like this song. And all they say is \\"Bounce, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo.\\" Then they have a short verse, then there's more \\"Bounce, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo.\\" Awesome, but I have no idea why I like it.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />8. Forest- This song is one of the slower songs on the disc. But the thing is who cares? Everything on this is at least sort of metal and it's all LOUD. This song is awesome and the lyrics are great.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />9. ATWA- Okay, THIS song is the slowest. This song is good and the lyrics are just plain original. I like it, and you should too.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />10. Science- This song is about science failing our world. (as you can tell from the lyrics) This song is really good, just as good as ATWA or Forest.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />11. Shimmy- This song is like Bounce to me. It's one of the Top 3 songs of the album to me, and there's no reason not to like it. The lyrics are pretty good, but there's better lyrics on this album. I just want to say, IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />12. Toxicity- This isanother song that you might have heard on the radio a lot. This song talks about how we are polluting and destroying the world. This is many peoples' favorite song, but this would be #5 for me. I'm not saying this song is bad, because it's not. There's just better songs.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />13. Psycho- This song is about cocaine-crazed groupie people. The lyrics on this song are awful, but the music and the great singing by Serj Tankian make up for that. This song is like Shimmy or Bounce, but barely not as good.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />14. Aerials- The third and final commercial song on the album. I take my statement back that I made back at #9. I said that ATWA was the slowest song on the album. It's not. That place is taken by this. This song is good and all, and it's very long, considering many System of a Down songs. It's slow and it's good. Although I like many others more on this CD, I still give this a 9.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />  Okay, I'm done. Now, for the burning question in everyone's mind...<br /><br />WHICH CD IS BETTER? SYSTEM OF A DOWN OR TOXICITY?<br /><br />  Well, I'd have to answer \\"System of a Down\\", just because the lyrics are better and there's no bad songs, like \\"X\\" or \\"Jet Pilot\\". If they would have replaced those two songs with two more great songs like the rest of the album, this could have placed ahead of their debut. I'm not saying Toxicity is bad, because it's still GREAT, but their debut is barely better, by about 0.0000010%. Just buy them both. Now, for the 5 best songs and the songs that just needed to be left off.<br /><br />#5. Toxicity<br /><br />#4. Chop Suey!<br /><br />#3. Shimmy<br /><br />#2. Bounce<br /><br />#1.

B000002KAT|5.0|This album, every song, has been reviewed to death.  The title song is outstanding but most of what Van does is outstanding.  I have read reviews of this album over the years.  Most speak of the bluesy soul wrenching songs Cyprus Avenue and Madam George.  These are wonderful songs.  But, I'm a romantic.  I could listen to Sweet Thing and The Way Young Lovers Do, forever.  More importandly, although we own more than 20 Van Morrison albums, the three that are played repeatedly are Astril Weeks, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 2, and Poetic Champions.  This is a \\"must have\\" CD.
0060764899|5.0|C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.<br /><br />To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.<br /><br />Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...<br /><br />How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.<br /><br />Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.<br /><br />Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience.

0064471837|5.0|\\"read or die\\" is the title for my review, and I will explain to you why. You MUST read this book, or you will die without reading the BEST OF THE BEST books in the world. And also this book is about a necromancer, who, of course, deals with Death. [yes, I added the capital D in for a reason. you will find out as you read along.]<br /><br />ANYWAY...<br />When I first picked up Sabriel, I did not expect much from it, and thought of it as a short fantasy book that might be interesting. However, as I started reading it, I became absorbed by the magical world, literally, of Garth Nix's Sabriel.<br /><br />Here's the general idea.<br /><br />Sabriel is a girl, and obviously the main character, of this story that takes place in a world where Charter Magic and the Dead roam about on one side of a wall, while the other side is completely modernised with guns and tanks in the military. Sabriel is raised on the modernised side, known as Ancelstierre, so she can be protected from the dangers of the free magic roaming about. Her father, a trained and special necromancer, lives on the other side, known as the Old Kingdom, and teaches her the art of his trade, which you will read about. Sabriel's father, one day, sends her a messenger, and she wonders what happened to her father, so she takes a journey to go find out.<br />As Sabriel is travelling, she meets many creatures, friend and foe, and many adventures await her. I can't say the ending is entirely expected, because there are definitely quite a few twists in the story that help it surprise and lock the reader's mind. In fact, there are many clever parts of the story where things that people may never have imagined will happen, and truly shock the reader. [In a good way, of course.]<br /><br />When I read this book, I could not put it down at all. My parents kept told me to do homework over and over again, but instead I would read and read and read, not letting it go or even letting the book out of my sight. In fact, I carried this book around wherever I went, until I finished it, and immediately reserved the next book, Lirael, from the library. I wish I had more money because I want to buy the book and keep it for myself, not just borrow it.

B00097DX3U|5.0|This album is superb, Audioslave are sounding tighter than in their debut, some fantastic hard rock songs and some great slower tempo numbers.  My favourites would have to be \\"Man or Animal\\" for hard rock, and \\"Dosent Remind Me\\" or \\"Be Yourself\\" for slower songs.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|When my mom got this CD for her birthday I totally wasn't interested. But when I heard some of the various songs I dicided to borrow it for awhile. It is awsome!! Each song seems to be it's own, no song alike. Although it does't have some songs like \\"St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Clud Band\\", it is still worth listening to. Plus inside there is a little book that shows the year each song came out and the record covers for them. And one last thing, on the internet there is a 1# CD site that has audio and video of the beatles playing.
B00000HYXB|5.0|The concept is a little cheesy, but the songs are rich, melodic and catchy. Every song is good.
B000002KCC|5.0|People either love or hate this album, but I propose that if you simply see Neil Young as personified by Harvest or After the Goldrush, you will be disappointed. Utterly. Why? Those are disciplined collections of tight songs that reflect a very big songwriter who could tap the folkish vein of the times, become a commercial success, please the record company, and satisfy most artists' insecurity. But Young is a fierce independent who has never fallen for that kind of safe, packaged, career trajectory. He's restless by nature, and in characteristic Young independence, Tonight's the Night throws order and commercial grooming out the window. By his own admission it's his most \\"liquid album,\\" i.e., loaded. It's raw and bulging with emotion; there's a compelling urgency to every note sung and played or misplayed, every cracking-voice line. Just when the glitter era of high-heels and David Bowie/Elton John were being broadcast from every radio and turntable, Neil Young threw this bone to the world like a big fat middle finger. The original album actually included a package of glitter with it, so that when you first opened the album it fell over everything. Interesting to note that this is one of his own all-time faves (see his biography, \\"Shakey\\"). Think about that for a moment. When Rick Danko of the Band heard it he flipped, urging Young to release what had been laying around for some time.  We played this album everyday for months from day one before we needed another copy. It signified something, I can't say what, in its attitude, its often beautiful melodies sandpapered with unfussy takes. The lyricism and spare sound create real power, hit a nerve whose vibration is ultimately affirming. Call it artistic triumph. No knife flash and glitter, just real blood.
0812550706|3.0|A recent LA Times story noted that Ender's Game was voted the favorite sci fi novel by Caltech students. Having read it as a 41 year old of slightly above average intelligence (at best), I realize this book was not written for my demographic. Ender's appeal to the young genius is understandable, but the rest of us are left with a thin, repetitive story and an ending that suggests Card must support the George W Bush preemptive war doctrine. The bulk of the story is devoted to Ender's training in battle school, which mostly consists of the same, minimally varied battle room simulation scene repeated ad nauseum. This culminates with an ending which 1) everyone except Ender sees coming from a mile off and, 2) suggests that if an alien race attacks Earth twice, without provocation and killing many millions, we would be wrong to go after them and exterminate the Buggers. Card has said that he wrote this as a setup for the only slightly superior Speaker for the Dead, and it reads as a story knocked off to lead to the next book in the series.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I will never thank enough the person who gave me the DVD as a gift! As an avid fan of Gaston Leroux's work, I was a bit apprehensive regarding this version. I don't think I have ever been happier to be so utterly wrong! Patrick Watson (Raoul) is a delightful lyrical tenor and makes a great romantic lead, while Emmy Rossum is the definitive Christine (sorry Ms. Brightman, I adore you but Rossum was perfectly cast), she conveys the perfect mix of purity, youth and innocence and comes of age right before our eyes. Brilliant. But my main appreciation has to go to Gerard Butler (the Phantom), who makes us feel his pain very keenly. You empathize with him big time. I was totally blown away by his ability to convey so much emotion while signing. Whoever made the final decision to cast him instead of a trained singer deserves all my admiration. It was a gutsy move, but a very brilliant one. He delivered every single note to perfection in terms of emotion and of vocal performance. He creates the perfect contrast with Watson and Rossum (intense and passionate compared to lyrical and romantic). &quot;The Point Of No Return&quot; is a particularly poignant number. Supporting actors are also very well cast and provide an interesting comic relief to the drama that unfolds, particularly in the case of Minnie Driver, Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone. You don't even have to be crazy about musicals to appreciate it.
B000069AUI|5.0|After listening to this for most of the past three years, I can safely say that this is music that will last.  Much like Steely Dan's music, which I have enjoyed for the past 30 years, I can see these songs aging that well.  Each and every song has a musical or vocal hook that just pulls you in.  In this day and age when a hummable melody is all but nonexistent in popular music, the lads in Coldplay have arrived to show us the way.  Keats famously said that \\"a thing of beauty is a joy forever.\\"  He might as well have been talking about this album.
B000005J56|5.0|I have had this cd since its release- and I still play it- which is a real surprise to me.  Most of our music these days is so disposable- one hit wonders- sixteen bands that sound & look identical-  but this cd lives on.  It's a beautiful & astonishing cd.  I sincerely believe its just one of those things that gets better each time I hear it.
6305949980|5.0|Words fail me when expressing how much I love this film. It first came out when I was in middle school and I have watched the film countless times since then; each viewing as entrancing as the last. I love this movie not only for it's visuals but also for its incredible music. I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman. Had he just put out an album with music like this without being attached to the movie I would have been happy, however, this incredible music is accompanied by spectacular visuals, ultimately creating an amazing experience.<br /><br />It is obvious to me that Tim Burton is a fan of Edward Gorey; the influence is apparent in his artwork. All of the art in the movie is rather dark, and dreary. The whole movie is stop-motion animation yet the movie takes on an ambiance of being sketched with a pencil. The story is very creative and quit alluring. All the characters in the film are relatable in one way or another. Jack is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. Though he is the King of fright, he longs for more in life, but he doesn't know what will fill that void. Then there is Sally. She longs to be free from her creator and wants to experience life on her own terms. Ultimately Jack discovers that the void he has been feeling is not from lack of fame but from lack of love, which he finds with Sally.<br /><br />As far as the DVD itself, you get wonderful bonuses with it. The production, commentaries, and creating of the movie is very interesting. It's amazing the amount of work, patience, and talent that went into this movie. Then there is the short film Vincent which Tim Burton made years before his breakthrough in the film industry. Though it is only a few minutes long, it's so cute, creative and well done. I just love everything about this DVD; the movie itself plus all the extras.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Truly one of the greater albums to come out of late and extremely unique. Artistically arranged yet easy to get hooked this is a must buy for anyone looking for some intelligent music! I hope this a trend of things to come.<br />SS
B000000W9Z|5.0|I've been meaning to write a review on this album for some time now. I was in middle-school when this album came out. My cousin, who is a huge David Bowie fan, bought this CD and we listened to it in the car while driving home. I was absolutely blown away. Sadly, this was the first time I really ever heard David Bowie (boy was I missing out). I ran out right away and bought my own copy and I've not been able to put it down since. This album is responsible for opening countless doors for me in the music world. Before this I was stuck in a rut of listening to whatever was on the radio but this album showed me there is so much more out there.<br /><br />David Bowie is a true artist. This album is a work of art. Every song takes on its own personality, and between the songs are creepy monologs of characters that accent the music. I love every track on this CD. Some of the tracks are very hard and industrial-like, and some are more upbeat and dance-like. I agree with another reviewer in saying that the album is quite bipolar; great analysis. This album is nothing like his previous works or his following; but then again, when are any of his albums similar to one another. David Bowie is forever changing with the times. That's why he's been one of the top musical artists for so long.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Yea it is an amazing album and it was much expected when someone told me about a year ago they were starting to work on another one I couldnt wait and now...its finally here.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Without a doubt Dream Theater is one of the most talented prog rock bands out there. There songwriting and overall talent are just amazing and production of this album was pretty good. I did enjoy the Instrumedley showing the diversity of the band. As always John Petrucci guitar work is incredible. Defintely worth picking up for any Dream Theater fan.
B00097DX3U|2.0|I am a big fan of Audioslave's first album (it rocks). If I were going to describe the new album I would call it dull and boring. I dont know were they are going with this, but they need to go back to were they jammed.
B0002X314C|1.0|I wasn't going to review this album, because of my strong negative feelings toward the  artist.I felt that the music was uninspired and his voice was very irritating.It amazes me how people seem to really like this man's music. Don't get me wrong I dont knock it,if thats what you really like,but this is definitely not what I'd call ''real'' music.<br /><br />I recommend  Spirit Tales by  Stephen Simmonds instead.
B00001OH7T|2.0|There are two good songs on this album: Fame and the Hot Chocolate inspired and somewhat lame Young Americans.  The other songs are mediocre at best, ie bland disco-soul without much soul, or depth and a plain cover of the Beatles song Across the Universe. Bowie sings well but comes across as a dillitente whose reasons for making Young Americans seemed to have more to do with the popular tastes of the day than artistic consideration. This album was made during the popular and thankfully shortlived accendancy of that musical pablum known as disco.  And while Young Americans isn't really disco, it's not soul or in any case good soul either. If I want to hear soul music or R&B circa 1974 I'll listen to Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield or any of the thousands of real practitioners of the genre.  If you want blue eyed soul you'd be better served by picking up a Righteous Brothers album, Hall and Oates or even Tom Jones. Most of Young Americans is boring b.s., the songs are subpar.<br /><br />Thankfully Bowie's facination with plastic soul was a short lived lapse in taste (and reason) and he moved on to Station To Station and the magnificent trilogy of Low, Heroes and Lodger, not to mention Scary Monsters. Young Americans is his worst album of the seventies with the worst album cover of his entire career. It's just so corny looking. I wouldn't pay more than three dollars for this album. Not only is it a complete betrayal of rock, not only is it a commercial sellout album, most of it at best bland. Rip the two \\"good\\" songs from a friend or download them from iMusic and forget this failed experiment.
0790729369|5.0|... until I can get widescreen.  Full screen?  Gimme a break. <br /> <br />J.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Scary Monsters is a focused album played with the intensity of punk while retaining an intellectual and slyly witty art rock flavor, and brings together the diverse musical styles that Bowie explored in the past while thoroughly (post) modernizing them. Bowie really created a monsterwork here from the beautiful and melodic sequel to Space Oddity, Ashes To Ashes to the cockney accented freakout of Scary Monsters (and supercreeps) to the Japanese language interludes of Its No Game Pt1. It's punk, it's science fiction, it's art rock and it's Bowies last truly great album.  In fact Scary Monsters may be Bowie's best album, certainly within the top 3.<br /><br />To get where he needed to go Bowie used a lot of collaborators on this album. Most notably Robert Fripp whose insane leads on the title track and Fashion are almost worth the cost of the album alone. Of course Pete Townshend, Roy Bittan, Carlos Alomar and Andy Clark aren't slouches either. But the true star of this album is Bowie himself. His singing is some of the most expressive of his career going from barely contained screams one moment to world weary crooning the next.  He pulls out every trick in his bag to great effect. Scary Monsters is  highly creative and highly recommended album. If you're a Bowie fan you need this in your collection.
0425180638|2.0|This I by far the worst Scarpetta book in the series. What a shame that Cornwell let this amazing series of books get away from her. First of all, this book does redeem that terrible ending to the preceding work, `Black Notice' in which for the umpteenth time Scarpetta foolishly allows a serial killer into her home for an inevitable dull climax. And this book does have a very engaging premise in which Scarpetta is the victim here on trial, and her name is being sullied. But aside from that, this book is a disaster.<br /><br />I hated the ending of Black Notice and was furious with Cornwell that she devastated a remarkably taught book with it. Other than that, I thought that the writing was the best she had done and was looking forwards to this new one because it seemed that Cornwell grew as an author from one book to the next. Also I felt that it was well past time that she tried to get away from the very predictable plot line that she has used in every single Scarpetta book up to this point. But for some reason, Cornwell's prose just falls apart here; it is dull and lengthy, without a shred of the suspense that I have grown to expect from this fine author. And the promising plot just collapses as she tries with all of her might to force it into the conformity and safe harbors of her past novels.<br /><br />Some of what I hated most about this book are that there is no detecting here, Scarpetta just happenstances upon the end solution, its as if Cornwell became tired of writing and just hurried through the last couple of chapters to bring this book to an end. Secondly, Some of what could have made this book interesting, such as Scarpetta's supposed guilt over a murder from `Black Notice' never becomes a full-fledged possibility. Instead Cornwell skates around this alluring plot, spending half of the book building it up, but never pushing it over the edge. Thirdly, what's the point of having any extra characters such as Lucy or Marino? Marino never seems to add anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever? All Marino ever does is leap to the wrong conclusions. Secondly, Lucy and her Last Precinct firm never get off the ground. Why was the Last Precinct firm even in the book? What did Lucy do to help her aunt?<br /><br />The only interesting thing this book offered was two interactions. One was with the psychiatrist Anna and the other was with the ADA Berger. Both of these scenes either reminiscing over WWII or walking through some evidence were well done.<br /><br />Cornwell, if you read these, break the mold. Do you have to have serial killers in every novel? Do you have to follow the same plot line?anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever?

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Making these kinds of movies is fraught with dangers. There are so many things that can go wrong, and some things did in this expensive-- costs were nearly two hundred millions dollars-- epic \\"inspired\\" by Homer's ILIAD.<br /><br />First the good: there are certainly many things to like about this movie. Although the film is about three hours long, the action moves rapidly. The ship scenes as well are the hand-to-hand combat battles are quite amazing and really do become epic-like. Some of the acting is terrific as well. Eric Bana as Hector gives a first-rate performance. Julie Christie in a small role as Achilles' mother is also great. But Peter O'Toole as King Priam-- British accent notwithstanding-- is simply wonderful. (Of course he is no stranger to period pieces with movies such as BECKET, LION IN WINTER and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA under his belt.) The scene where he approaches Achilles to beg for the dead body of his beloved son Hector achieves high tragedy, something that rarely happens in epics. Just as in grand opera with its usual outrageous plots, when real acting occurs, it's all the more appreciated.<br /><br />Then those things that really aren't that significant (so-so). First, the director plays hard and fast with the original story; but after all, it's just his inspiration, not his roadmap. Remember: the movie is not the book. There are also missed opportunities. For instance, there is a beautifully scene in the ILIAD when Hector goes off to battle and sees his wife and child for what will be the last time. Because he is wearing his helmet, his baby son does not recognize him and cries. This is one of the most touching scenes in all of the ILIAD. I thought the director was setting us up for that in this movie. The child cries as Hector says goodbye, however, and then puts on his helmet later.<br /><br />Finally the bad: Orlando Bloom as Paris is totally unconvincing as someone Helen would even look at. And Brad Pitt, for all his buffed-up beauty, is still Brad Pitt, only with long hair and in ancient Grecian drag. He is completely miscast as the sober, brooding, sulking Achilles.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, however, for all the battles and the fine acting by Peter O'Toole.is still Brad Pitt, only with long hair and in ancient Grecian drag.

B00097DX3U|5.0|If you are a \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" fan this CD is for you.  If you are just an Audioslave fan it will blow you away.  The guitar solos alone make it worth buying this CD.    It was well worth the wait.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|A day after picking up the album (dvd bonus edition) I shouldn't venture too far to analyze the thing, but I must say that this exceeds any expectations I had.  The whole album is just ridiculously good.  It is definitely different than the first album, but I wouldn't like a band that really kept making the same album forever.  I can't find any flaws with this.   <br />As for the bonus materials, the track on the DVD \\"The Swagga\\" is pretty good, but I wish I could play it on my stereo like a normal cd, it should've just been added as a bonus to the regular disc.  The track to download is also good.  The video material isn't very lengthy, but it's nice to have if you're a fan. <br /> <br />There should be lots of hits here if there's any soul at all left in the crass corporate radio world.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is Zeppelin's greatest and, unfortunetly, last great album. While I and II might be famous for supersizing old Chicago blues classics, III for introducing British folk rhythms, IV for its Zeppeln standards like \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" for its sweeping instrumental arrangements, \\"Graffiti\\" is the only album that is entirely symbolic of Zeppelin's sound alone. Out of all of their albums, this is the one I would choose to play for a non-Zeppelin fan to demonstrate what they were all about. Of course, there is the standard review of the album, which always requires a mention of the blending of their classic blues-rock hybrid with \\"Middle-eastern and folk rhythms.\\" But any band can bog down an album with an eclectic gathering of different genres. What makes \\"Graffiti\\" so great is that the songs are musically amazing, but also incredibly listenable. Despite using orchestras, \\"Middle-eastern\\" instruments, and synthesizers, \\"Graffiti\\" never at any point comes across as pretentious or arrogant. Zeppelin used those instruments not just to look special, but because they knew it would result in great music. Side one is the greatest six song span in their entire career. \\"Custard Pie\\", to use layman's terms, is arguably the most kickass song in their entire repetoire. \\"The Rover\\" is a tour-de-force that is the forerunner to every early-eighties metal band from Priest to Maiden. \\"In My Time of Dying\\" never tires during its exhilerating 11 minutes, and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" stands out despite not being on the album that shares the same name. \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is a classic, which, with its humorous lyrics and ultra-funky rhythm, displayed Zeppelin's incredible versatility. And, of course, side one ends with \\"Kashmir,\\" for which words cannot do justice. Side two is slightly less remarkable, but that is similar to saying that Julius Erving was slightly less remarkable than Michael Jordan. It includes the hard-edged \\"The WantonSong\\" and \\"Sick Again\\" and the epic \\"In the Light\\" and \\"Ten Years Gone\\", among other classics. Quite simply, it is their best album.
0380778556|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it a thousand times and I am still captivated by the sensory details Daphne DuMaurier uses. I have been to Manderly, I have stood in the gallery hall, I have seen Mrs. Danvers- cold and angry and I have watched Mrs. DeWinter grow from a gauky girl into a woman. I have sometimes felt as if I were at tea with them in the library and I could almost pet Jasper's head.<br /><br />This is a classic literary work. It never ages and I give this book as a gift to special friends at Christmas and everyone of them has done the same.<br /><br />There will never be another story to parallel this.
B00000K0DT|5.0|My god, this movie is the most mindblowing, intense, and truly spellbinding movie i've ever seen. great cast, great script, and what can i say about the ending that hasnt been said. So many quotable lines in this movie, from the \\"devil's greatest trick\\" to the \\"hand me the keys you...\\" well you know. and did i mention the end was unbelievable. singer could have simply said, \\"ok heres the ending...surprise\\" and just called it a day. but no, the way the end is revieled...i mean honestly its the coolest piece of footage i think i've ever seen. i wanna say it but i dont wanna spoil it, just go see this movie now.
B0007GAERG|1.0|PEOPLE....PEOPLE....PEOPLE <br /> <br />Open up your ears.  This album is PG---pure garbage. <br /> <br />Mariah Carey is so overrated. Those high notes--ergh. <br /> <br />They fit a NATURALLY sweet voice, like Minnie Riperton or Chante Moore, not Mariah Carey's screeches. It probably wouldn't be so bad if, like Beyonce, Ashanti (girls who CANNOT carry a tune at all) she did not try to fuse this awful Hip/Hop--Rap with POP/R&B.  Her introductory material in the early 90s was........tolerable.  Now this mess is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />I am not \\"hating\\" on Mariah Carey, or Beyonce and the like, but just ask yourselves for a moment, are these rap/R&B songs going to stand the test of time and be popular 10, 20 or 30 years from now, when most of you turn 40, 50 years old.  Huhh.. I think not.  Beyonce/Mariah's shaking it now, but what happens when they turn 50, it won't be so cute anymore, will it?  I didn't think so!!! <br /> <br />If you want a true musical experience and music that you will enjoy for years to come, check out REAL singers.  They're not hard to find, just check out those artists that are not topping the charts.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|ok, honestly, watching the previews for this movie didnt really imply that it was oscar worthy. it looked like a bunch of uneccessary gore, and make no mistake, it is violent. however, its actually a very good movie. the acting isnt A+ at moments, but the story is actually very well written. the movie obviously doesnt rely on its cast (when's the last time cary elwes was the top guy, Robin Hood Men In Tights?) so it hits you with a plot that twists your mind in 8 different directions. the games the killer plays are groteque and may make the weaker audience turn away, but the lessons that Jigsaw teaches do have a purpose. the end was my favorite, if any of your friend told you they predicted the end to this movie, its a lie. it's so out of left field, yet still blows you away in that, when you think about it, its not illogical. no, the movie isnt Se7en (the movie that set the standerd for this genre) but its still worth the price of admission. fans of the creepy crime dramas are sure to enjoy sAw. hopefully the sequal is just as good, or better.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is a great album!  It's \\"classic\\" SOAD.  It's one of those albums where the first time you hear the song you just say \\"WTF?!\\"  Then you listen again and can't stop!  Buy it, it works for fans of just about any genre.  I personally have a soft spot for heavy metal (not rap metal, which isn't even metal, it's just crap!), this isn't your typical heavy metal album but it hits pretty hard.  On a side note to the duche(?) bags who compared this to slayer and other awesome death/thrash metal bands, are you retarded?  SOAD is nothing like those bands, their music has some of the same elements but it's not the same.  Would you call a fat guy w/ man boobs a woman just because he has some of the same parts, ie. the man boobs?  I sure hope not.  If you're looking for a normal thrash album, pass on this until you're in the mood for something a little different but still awesome, then go buy it!  Anyways, why are you still reading this, you haven't went to buy it yet?!  WTF?!
B000050FEN|5.0|wow, thats really all i could say at the end of this movie. dark, grungy, twisted, creepy and all around powerful. Se7en is excellently cast, brilliantly written, and masterfully directed. Pitt and Freeman are great as the token polar opposite cops, yet take this familiar role to a new level. and Kevin Spacey, what is there to say except Fincher could not have picked a better person to fully display the power of John Doe. Spacey only shows up in the last 20 minutes, but the scenes with him are so well acted that he should have received two oscars that year (in addition to Usual Suspects). The story is incredibly well written, a killer that slays victims in the form of the the seven deadly sins. You never see the crimes, just the aftermath. Through this, Fincher makes the audience use their imagination, which almost makes it creepier. not one scene of this movie is wasted, every one puts another piece of the puzzle together. this is the one movie that gives the bad guy full control throughout the entire piece and is still a great flick. Se7en is just proof that, sometimes the good guys get the short end of the straw, no matter how sadistic that bad guy really is. Get this movie, dont rent it, dont watch it on TV, just buy it, you wont be disappointed.
B000002KZT|1.0|Satan can do many things in this worls for exemple help metal bands to compose songs and write lyrics. Slayer is band controlled by dark forces. Only Jesus can save them from eternal destruction. <br /> <br />This cd is music from hell which is not surprise because demons has really helped these guys!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Let me start of by stating that in no way is Toxicity SOAD's best album!  Some of the songs still make me cringe after being a hardcore fan from the beggining of their self-titled.  Some say Mezmerize is too repeditive, but I must say, what do you expect?  Toxicity had like one line per song, over and over again.  With the repeditivness it is STILL great music.  I love it.  This album is just amazing.  Starts off with a song thats nice and slow and reminds us all that this is only the \\"soldier's side\\" (side one) - in several months we will get side two.  The rest of the songs are catchy and sometimes funny.  I definatly reccomend it to all who like System in the least.  I have listened to it several times a day for the last week and still crave it everyday.  Its great.  Anyone who says otherwise must have only started liking SOAD when they released that poppy piece of crap Chop Seuy on the radio... Turn your radio off and put this CD in your stereo!
B000062YB1|1.0|Yeah! Do you really want to go hell? <br />Listen to this cd and you'll know what kind of music demons likes to play. Of course you are burning all the time and can't see no one there. You are just alone with the beast.

B00080ZG10|5.0|To the two reviewers below and others thinking the same thing about the color. There isn't suppose to be green in the first half of the film (it was this was in the theater on purpose)! It represents the two-tone color look of the 1920's. The green is a bluish hue, just read the IGN.com review and it will explain this to you and why Scorsese did the color this way. Now on to the review...I didn't know much about Howard Hughes going in other than the fact he was a rich recluse who sometimes rented entire hotels just so he could stay alone in solitude for nights on end. But after seeing this film I really feel I know the guy. I am not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio by any means, but I have to admit he nails the part here. All the supporting actors are great as well, with Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn really standing out by copying her voice and body movements perfectly. I really like Clint Eastwood and his film Million Dollar Baby, but Martin Scorsese should have finally gotten the Oscar this time around that he should have won 14 years ago for Goodfellas. The Aviator is worth owning and it stands proud beside my copies of Raging Bull and Goodfellas.
0790729601|4.0|You're probably thinking that this is your typical Schwarzennegar vehicle, but \\"Eraser\\" is actually more fun than that. It's not spectacular, but then it doesn't overload you and overwhelm its thin story with a lot of expensive pyrotechnics, and best of all, it doesn't make you feel like an utter idiot for buying into its rapid-fire nonsense. <br /> <br />The Plot: our hero is John Krueger (which is easier to spell), a lone-wolf commando who handles high-risk participants in the Justice Department's witness protection program. He creates phony identities and lives for people who risked their lives by testifying for the government. When necessary (which proves often), he also stages brutal but effectively believable deaths for the witnesses themselves - anything to throw off the trail of their hunters. (We learn this watching Kruger take out a pair of hitmen sent to rub out a mob-informer played by the late Bob Pastorelli, better known as Murphy Brown's house painter.) He's so good erasing the lives of witnesses and their hunters that he's even known as...okay, you've probably figured out that part by now. \\"Eraser\\" kicks off when Kruger's latest charge is Lee (Vanessa Williams), a beautiful and brilliant programmer who can implicate her boss in a complex though clearly illegal arms deal. Cyrez, the defense contractor she works for, took billions in tax-dollars to develop rail-gun technology it openly declared impossible. (Rail-guns use electromagnetism to fire projectiles at near-light speeds and capable of punching holes in battleships). Lee stumbles onto evidence that Cyrez not only worked the bugs out, creating a handier version of the impossible weapon, but is now on the verge of selling a shipload of their guns to a thoroughly vile Russian arms dealer. Unlike the wiseguys Kruger normally deals with, Cyrez has enough at stake to pay for powerful friends, even some who work for John.  <br /> <br />\\"Eraser\\" so faithfully follows the rules of action-thrillers, thatit cheerfully surprises you with its lack of surprise. Will there be strings of lop-sided gun battles? Of course. Will our hero narrowly survive in various impossible to believe stunts (a free-fall from 10,000 feet, after being near-rammed by a 727)? Natch! Will the bad guys and other enemies suffer murderous one-liners? You bet! (\\"You're luggage\\" Kruger tells a wanton alligator during a shoot-out improbably set at NYC's Central Park Zoo). \\"Eraser\\" also throws in some good supporting players - especially Pastorelli, but James Caan as his mentor, Williams who holds her own as the damsel in not-so-much distress, and also Pastorelli's shady associates of the Baltimore docks (\\"Don't make me hurt you, Mikey!\\"). \\"Eraser\\" is perfect when you need something to help you decompress. I caught this blast-fest after taking the '96 NYS Bar exam, and it (almost) erased the previous two tension-filled months.
071198042X|4.0|Peter Freestone travelled over hill and dale with Freddie, and holds very little back in his account of life with one of rock's most \\"mercurial\\" stars.<br /><br />Was he the man who knew Freddie best?  He claims to be, and yet there are a number of fans and other authorities who feel he has claimed this intimate title without the back story to back it up.  He knew the tragic star for eleven years, the last years before his death from AIDS, and he even became kind of a nurse to him, so there were elements of Freddie's life he had an eyewitness view of, and saw things no other mortal was ever privileged to see.<br /><br />The music, the madness, the mirth, all are aspects that Peter isn't so hip on, but I dare any reader to go through this book right to the end and fail to shed a tear as the implications of Freddie's diagnosis begin to take root, and people begin to realize what this will mean to Freddie himself and to all those who loved Queen and rock music too.  Peter F. was there, amd he writes sensitively about a difficult issue.  Elsewhere his writing is humorous and sparkly, with a bit of an outsider edge, when he describes the ingenious ways he thought of to protect Freddie from the punters and paparazzi, but at the end you will feel your heart in your throat.
B000669GAI|4.0|First of all, everyone knows that the first three Pearl Jam albums are widely considered to be the best of all the Pearl Jam albums and second, Creed released their first album years after \\"Ten\\" was released so how could Pearl Jam been able to rip off Creed. Thirdly, last time I checked Creed broke up and Pearl Jam is still around making great music. I am not the biggest Pearl Jam fan but I know good music when I hear it and this greatest hits collection is just that. I just get a little mad when a nu-metal fan can't get their facts straight. Next time you write a review, make sure you don't make yourself look like such an idiot.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I consider myself a huge System of a Down fan. When I heard about the new album coming out a couple months back, I was overwhelmed with excitement. Everyday, yearning for May 17th to come around. Well, it finally came... and S.O.A.D. did not dissappoint.  <br /> <br />The Album starts off with \\"Soldier Side - Intro\\" which is a great opening track, a calm intro that kicks off the fast-paced adrenaline rushed album. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"BYOB\\" which is currently S.O.A.D.'s single. \\"BYOB\\" is a great political song that will kick your ass one minute and the next minute take you into a calm catchy pop chorus. <br /> <br />After hearing the first 2 songs I couldn't wait for the 3rd. \\"Revenga\\" is next, such a great song. Very melodic at times, much like a majority of the songs on this cd. <br /> <br />\\"Cigaro\\" is number 4, which is one of S.O.A.D.'s thrash metal songs, with hilarious lyrics and violent guitar riffs. <br /> <br />\\"Radio/Video\\" is next. Which in my opinion, is the best on the album. One minute it you will be \\"rockin' out\\" to it. The next you will be shocked by the cool reggae/ska beat. This is a song where you can tell Daron's vocals have improved greatly. <br /> <br />\\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" is number 6 on the cd. SOAD's second song about cocaine. Much like \\"Cigaro\\" this song has hilarious lyrics with a deadly riff. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Violent Pornography\\" which is second best on the album. The guitar in this song is so simple, yet so great. It made me want to pick up my guitar and learn it. By track number 7  I was convinced Serj and Daron were a great duo. <br /> <br />\\"Question!\\" is next. This song goes back to \\"Toxicity\\" SOAD. Reminds me of \\"Chop Suey!\\". <br /> <br />Song number 9 is \\"Sad Statue\\". \\"Sad Statue\\" has a killer riff at the beginning that makes you want to jump around the room and rip the blinds off the nearest window. But, again. By the chorus you get another surprise of a calm pop hook. <br /> <br />\\"Old School Hollywood\\" is next. This song is a nice quaint song with unusual lyrics and a great added touch of a synth. <br /> <br />\\"Lost in Hollywood\\" is the only song on Mezmerize I could do without. Simply because Daron completely takes over in this song. If this song was sung by Serj. It would be great. <br /> <br />To sum it up, Mezmerize is a great album. Daron Malakian is the genius behind it. If only he could have stepped aside and let Serj handle some of the vocals, this album would be nearly flawless. But, System of a Down succeeded in leaving you wanting more. 6 months until Hypnotize.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If your a fan of the zombie genre, this is the best comedy horror since Return of the Living Dead (excluding Dead Alive). Great make-up, some gory moments,and plenty of inside (the genre) jokes. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! FUN! FUN! FUN!
B000024J9B|5.0|I have thought about purchasing this set for quite some time, and finally decided to do so (Along with the 60s collection). Much of the \\"King's\\" best material was done in the 70's (An \\"American Trilogy, \\"Danny Boy\\", and his live version of \\"The Impossible Dream\\" to name a few), so it is worth the money spent. The reality is as time goes by (Elvis has been dead for almost 30 years now), he becomes more important then ever before. As music increasingly goes downhill (Rap, dance music, music for teengers (Backstreet Boys, Brittney Spears etc), techo and house music, and of course, hate filled stuff like Marilyn Manson to name a few examples), you go back to the masters for quality: It does not matter if you are talking about Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Patsy Cline, George Strait, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Pink Floyd, or of course Elvis, the principle is the same: If you want music that has quality lyrics, that can be entertaining and intelligent, and with people actually playing musical instruments (Instead of using computers), this is where to go.    What I would recommend getting is all three boxed sets (The 50's set as well), his 68 Comeback Special, his 2nd To None (For \\"If I Can Dream\\" (My favorite Elvis Song)), and his Hollywood Hits (FOR \\"Follow That Dream'\\" and \\"Kissin' Cousins\\"), and you will have all the Elvis you will need to last a lifetime.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Some will call it formulaic.  Others will call it a re-hash.  Don't listen to them, and just call it \\"Nine Inch Nails.\\"  Trent achieved what he set out to do in this carefully constructed album that will have fans remembering why they listened to Nine Inch Nails in the first place.  Haunting ballads, edgy rough tracks, and drum beats that will stick to the roof of your mouth, \\"With Teeth\\" delivers the kind of creativity and innovation that Nails fans have come to expect, nay, demand from Trent. <br /> <br />An incredibly personal album, \\"With Teeth\\" carries with it the same sometimes reflective, sometimes brooding, and always disgruntled tones that all Nine Inch Nails albums have.  Expect to hear \\"feeling sorry for myself\\" style lyrics that will take some back to the Pretty Hate Machine days, followed up by angst-filled shout-rock that challenges \\"don't you ****ing know what you are!?\\"   <br /> <br />The uber-NIN geeks will revile how accessible Trent made this album.  The less ardent fans who came on board after \\"The Downward Spiral\\" will be disappointed that there is no direct equivalent to \\"Closer\\" on this album.  Neither of these camps are important.  The bottom line is the music, and if good, thoughtful music is what you like, you'll find yourself reaching for your \\"With Teeth\\" album often. <br /> <br />My biggest dissappointment was that the album wasn't at least three songs longer.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This might be my favorite dire straits release.  It starts out with the epic \\"telegraph Road\\", which is easily the best song on the album, and mabye the best song the dire straits ever recorded.  then next comes \\"private investigations\\".  This is probably the most haunting song they have ever recorded.  hearing it can make you almost imagine a scene in an old black and white detective film.  Skip the butchered version of this on the both the best disks and get this. Industrial disease fallows.  the one thing that amazes me is that this wasn't a bigger hit than it was.  It is easily the catchiest song on the album, and its full of Knophler's trade-mark sarcasim.  the title track is a very pretty song. It is full of beatiful lyrics and equally beatiful spainish guitar licks.  \\"It never rains\\" is a very good song to.  but it seems to ramble on rather pointlessly at the end. <br />This is probably my favorite Dire straits CD.  Another thing is that even though it is only 5 songs.  It is still longer that making movies(another great CD). <br />
B00065GWK6|5.0|If you love the movie, you will watch to watch is many times. <br /> <br />If you hate it, watch it again.  I guarantee you will then like it. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite is a great movie, just takes some getting used to.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Faking the two-stripe and three-stripe color process from the 30's trashed this movie. Why make a movie look bad intentionally? Also, Leonardo DiCapro was the wrong choice to play Howard Hughes.
B000000H5K|5.0|With so much water having flown into the river since the release of \\"Roots\\" certain concrete conclusions can be safely drawn.       All the bands that were influenced by this monumental album (including Max Cavalera's own Soulfly) have not been able to match the incomparable ferocity and raw rage that Roots unleashed onto an unsuspectful public almost 10 years ago.     It is highly unlikely anyone ever will too.      If we were to scan for the most significant releases in music (and i mean in all the musical spectrum) \\"Roots\\" would rate way up there amongst the most original and influential albums of all time, not to mention one that drew yes many copycats but like all genius efforts it's nearly impossible to reproduce.       Obviously for anyone who's heard it, the winning factor here is the truly hair-raising percussions (involving even tribal percussionists from Brazil). This tribal feeling achieved in Roots isnt only unique in its conception, but it would take someone totally devoid of any musical appreciation not to be utterly shaken upon hearing it. Nothing to take away from the guitars of course, because without the surreally vicious riffs Sepultura came up with here the percussion alone wouldnt be able to do the trick. The guitars here pushed the envelope to unimagined limits:    dense, ultra-tight, and angry beyond belief but more importantly melodic nevertheless. Sepultura proved that guitars can have the weight of an eighteen-wheeler without being simply pointless noise. Or, that you can make a stunningly heavy song with a melody people can remember, in stark contrast with literally 100s of metal bands who consume themselves in decibels but fail miserably in the musical department.        Clearly this was the band's paramount effort and with the departure of Max Cavalera afterwards they were never able to match themselves this musical masterpiece.       The title song and not only have become heavy rock classics in dj sets around the world ever since andit will take some seriously out of this world effort to dethrone them from their place of rock glory.       What's more substantial is that the band established themselves with \\"Roots\\" as one with one of the most important rock albums of all time under their belts, one of those albums that justifiably deserve the title of \\"definitive rock album\\", in fact, and as far as I'm concerned it's among the top 5 rock albums in this genre's history.    If for whatever reason you've missed out on this classic do yourself a huge favor and discover it.
B0007XT87G|3.0|Well Steven, you've caught a wave to our local AOR grind and crud station. Though a novelty hearing Porcupine Tree trashing Tool, this outing is, indeed, a dead wing - it never gets off the ground. It's a sad day when Adrian Belew has to stand in to carry off the best two guitar solo's on the disc. It never occured to me in my wildest dreams that I'd be giving a PT release the thumbs down. The only redeeming quality is that this may bring (long overdo) attention to a band thats a heck of alot better than you'll hear here. Why one of the truly remarkable guitarists of our time (among other instruments) has been in a retrograde orbit since \\"Siginify\\" continues to baffle me. If you want to hear SW in his prime, listen to the classic \\"Dark Matter.\\" Or better yet, get a hard-to-find issue of \\"Coma Divine.\\" Now THAT'S a mind blower. My stunning introduction to PT was \\"In Absentia\\". It has been played more than any collection I've owned in 30 some odd years. If you're new to PT, don't miss their early stuff. In doing so you'll come to recognize what a truly remarkable band they are. I'll wait hopefully for the next release.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I loved soundgarden because of chris cornell's voice but I never cared much for rage against the machine because of tom morello. there is no doubt that he is a great guitarist but he likes to show off and is a little arrogant. there are a few songs on here where he does short solos that have no business being in the song. he was more guilty of the on there first album. you can see how arrogant he is by watching him play. Aside from that all of the others are up to par. the bass and drums are perfect. this album is more laid back which i liked but i missed the heavier songs because chris is so good at those. it is better than there first album. they sound like they have really come together as a band. chris' lyrics really drive the album.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|With its catchy lyrics and melodies, this album is the best of their work. Their indirect, political ideas are present in a smart way like all their other albums.  Love the double melodies!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I normally don't give reviews on cd's but I had to for this one. I received it a week and a half ago and right away I loved it. I listened to it 3x strait the first day I got it and 3x the following day. I'd been disappointed in Mariah's past few cd's. Rainbow was alright but that's when she started getting soft, I didn't bother getting Glitter & Charm bracelet because I don't listen to cotton candy music. I preview all cd's on Amazon before I get them. This one seemed like she was getting back to singing actual R&B so I took a chance and bought it. I'm SO glad I did! This is one of her best cd's since Daydream & Butterfly and I LOVE those cd's. I'm gonna break tha cd down now.. <br /> <br />(1. It's like that 10/10. This song is off tha chain. <br /> <br />(2. We belong together 10/10. I LOVE this song! <br /> <br />(3. Shake it off 10/10. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />(4. Mine again 8/10. If I'm not in the mood I can skip this song but it's still good. <br /> <br />(5. Say Something 10/10. I have this song as my cell's voicemail. Hot. <br /> <br />(6. Stay the night 10/10. My 2nd favorite song on this cd. It usually gets played more than once. <br /> <br />(7. Get your number 6/10. Jermain Dupree whines too much on this song, not Mariah's fault. It's alrite but I usually skip it unless I'm in tha mood to hear it.  <br /> <br />(8. One and only 10/10. I feel her on this song & Twista.. who doesn't like Twista? <br /> <br />(9. Circles 10/10. Tite, I love this song. <br /> <br />(10. Your girl 0/10. Bubble gum/cotton candy music. I always skip this song. <br /> <br />(11. I wish you only knew 9/10. Her singing saves this song, tha content is cotton candy like.  <br /> <br />(12. To the floor 10/10. Mariah & Nelly.. need I say more? <br /> <br />(13. Joy Ride 10/10. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD! ALWAYS PLAYED MORE THAN ONCE! If you like 4th of July and Underneath the stars then you'll love this song. <br /> <br />(14. Fly like a bird 10/10. Church song she sings beautifully. <br /> <br />Did I mention I'm listening to this cd right now for the 2nd time in a row right now? YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD! ONE OF MARIAH'S BEST!
B0009AM5JK|4.0|One word that will explain this album... different. The album is a little off the theme of their debut and not as good but is still worth at least a listen. Some tracks really live up to what the Gorillaz can do and to their first album and some don't fall into that but I'm not saying that they are bad but that some Gorillaz fans will not enjoy the tracks as much. These tracks are:<br />Kids With Guns, Feel Good Inc, November Has Come, and Dare.<br />What I'm really saying is that these tracks would fit in well into the old album and the others are a little different. Really all the tracks are great and I love the CD myself except for the two last tracks. Both Don't Get Lost In Heaven and Demon Days are sung by the London Choir thingie. I did not buy this album to listen to a british choir and the songs are just bad, especially the album titled Demon Days track. Now I know why it's the last one. Even with a few negatives this album is really worth listening to. Personally I love it. A good point is that you get the coolest little picture book in it that has a picture to each track. <br />Demon Days - 8.1 / 10
B0002BO0HG|5.0|this album is not only for antony's fans but for everyone! <br /> <br />his voice is extremely beautifull....played at piano and added more instruments to melodys. <br /> \\"i am a bird\\" has more simple harmonies then this debut album..still..a fantastic album! <br /> <br />if you like this one you'll love \\"i am a bird\\" or \\" the lake \\" ep....well...anyone that likes antony music knows that everysong it's a surprise and waiting to the beauty to come <br />
B00005RHGK|2.0|I had a hard time trying to decide wether to give this movie two or three stars.  In the end I decided 2 but I could see if someone wanted to give 3. <br /> <br />The good: <br />1) First half of the  movie. <br />2) The creature before you actually see him. <br />3) The truck he drives. <br />4) The old school horror movie feel they try to give. <br />5) The attractive sister. <br /> <br />The bad: <br />1) The second half the movie. <br />2) The creature after you see fully see it. <br />3) The physic.  <br />4) The stupid song. <br />5) the fairly weak story. <br /> <br />In short if they would have kept the creature a mystery a bite longer, took the physic out, and came up with a slightly better premise for the creature this movie would have been great.  As it is, it's still fun, not great but fun. If you like horror movies and do not require it to have a deep plot or to wow you. This movie will entertain.
B00008BXJF|5.0|The Power to Believe is the last KC album I purchased and again I ask myself why I waited all this time!?  <br /> <br />I had some reserves about it having heard The ConstruKction of Light before. I actually like TCoL but it needs a lot more listening before getting into it. The ConstruKction of Light is 100% full of testosterone, ultra complex and sometimes heavy as hell (see Larks' Tongues in Aspic IV ;)). The Power to Believe has a lot of different dynamics, more than TCoL. The track order is balanced better and the production is a lot more satisfying. Now, it's time for a track by track review folks! <br /> <br />The Power to Believe I - \\"She carries me through days of apathy, to washes over me. She saved my life in a matter of speaking, when she gave me back the power to believe.\\" That's all. <br /> <br />Level Five - HEAVY instrumental based on some typical Frippian reduced scales. Really cool. (That was the only track I'd heard about before buying the album) <br /> <br />Eyes Wide Open - Catchy Adrian Belew song about lost opportunities. That was in my opinion what they missed on TCoL : a little break with a good song. <br /> <br />Elektrik - Excellent use of percussive electronics. Classic twin guitar picking attack with a solid groove. Best instrumental and possibly best song of the album. <br /> <br />Facts of Life - Here again they rock hard but I feel a certain touch of humor (Fripp's solo). Lyrics are crappish. Cool song though. <br /> <br />The Power to Believe II - Oriental mood. Adds variety to the album. Very appropriate. <br /> <br />Dangerous Curves - 5:30 instrumental crescendo with electronic percussions, great soundscapes and the SAME riff from Adrian Belew. Solid! (I cover it with my band...) <br /> <br />Happy With What You Have to Be Happy With - Hilarious song. They make fun of Nu-metal bands with over distorted guitars, vocal distortion box (see lyrics) and sampled turntables scratchings! <br /> <br />The Power to Believe III - More experimental track with a very electronic sound. Cool <br /> <br />The Power to Believe IV - See The Power to Believe I and add some beautiful soundscapes to it.  <br /> <br />Finally, I consider that this album is essential to a KC discography and it's pretty accessible by the band's standards. It may probably be their last ever so get yourself a treat. It's pretty addictive.
B000669GAI|2.0|I give Pearl Jam 2 stars.. why? Well they didn't become good unti recently, and they didn't help invent grunge. <br /> <br />Creed invented grunge, millions are trying to copy their formula. <br /> <br />For a good greatest hits, get Creed.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down has been a favorite of mine for years. They have such great lyrics and they play FAST as hell. <br /> <br />Beat that Slayer! <br /> <br />Reign in Blood is no match for the burtality of this album. <br /> <br />A must have for speed metal fans.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I thought that it was a great film. I don't know what those people were talking about at the bottom. But I am a comic fan in real life too so that is also why I liked it. Special Effects were good but the story line kind of declined in the end. Other than that i thought that it was a good movie.
B00000612P|5.0|When Rod Stewart released his third solo album in 1971, he was still a full-time member of the Faces.  [In fact, Ron Wood plays on all tracks and Ian McLagan also provides organ on a few tracks.] EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY is arguably the best album of Stewart's entire career. There is not a weak track to be found.  The three Stewart originals are superb.  The title track (co-written with Wood) rocks as hard as anything he did with the Faces. \\"Maggie May\\" (co-written with guitarist Martin Quinttenton) was Stewart's breakthrough hit. \\"Mandolin Wind\\" showed that Stewart had not completely abondoned his folk roots.<br /><br />Rounding out the album are five well chosen covers. From Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right\\" to Bob Dylan's \\"Tomorrow is Such a Long Time\\" (with its \\"Amazing Grace\\" intro) and Tim Hardin's \\"Reason to Believe,\\" Stewart's too-much-whiskey-and-cigarettes voice add a warmth and depth to these songs.  And his cover of the Temptation's \\"I Know I'm Losing You,\\" powered by Mick Waller's drumming, shows his affinity for soul music.<br /><br />If all you know of Rod Stewart are his hits--and he's had plenty--you've only been exposed to one facet of this gifted artist.  This album belongs in any serious music fan's collection.  ESSENTIAL

B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie was a total train wreck.  Made no sense, characters had no personality.  Napoleon's awkwardness is painful and irritating to watch.  Only ever saw this movie because of all the hype around it, which I still don't understand.  There are better movies, ones with plots, that you can watch.  I can't really understand why anyone over the age of 15 would find this funny.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Although this album is different from their debut, it's nevertheless just as brilliant. I would say it's a little less heavy, but still have the strong Tom Morello riffs, and the superb Chris Cornell vocals. I've waited a long time for new music to save me from the pop-sters of the world who only care about 'image' and dance choreography, and I'm thanking God for real musicians like Chris and Tom. So what if Tom likes to show off, he has the right to. Mind you, I was neither a Soundgarden or RATM fan, but started recognizing Chris's talent first with Temple of the Dog, and then his solo album then Audioslave's debut. <br /> <br />For everyone who did not think much of Out of Exile, I respect your opinion, but please don't belittle the musical genius of Audioslave just because you don't appreciate their brand of music. Oh, and if you ever saw these guys live, you'd be hooked like the rest of us.
B00005JNEI|4.0|whatever your political ideology farenheit 9/11 is worth seeing. Yes sure mike is biased but would he be effective if he sat on the fence? would anyone bother to listen to him? probably not. He is sensational to get the message out there, what you make of it is your own PERSONAL opinion. Ignore the declarations that the movie is ahem \\"excrement\\" those are low blows from individuals who don't bother to come up with adequete hypothesis' as to WHY one shouldn't see the film. It is NOT a hoard of lies, and it is NOT an unbiased glance at the Bush Administration but niether of those things is really a surprise. <br /> <br />Personally I was moved not by the idiocy of Bush which everyone has come to accept but by the images of broken and bloodied children who have lost their homes and families and likely their futures.

0792843584|2.0|It's hard to believe that this November it will be 25 years since this movie made its, uh, mark on film history. And trust me, 25 years later I can remember like yesterday the whole controversy over that doomed project. In 1978, being a nieve movie-goer at age 18, was blown away by \\"The Deer Hunter\\" so much so that I would pay to see it 4 times in the movie theater. So NATURALLY I was eagerly awaiting Michael Cimino's follow-up project. <br /> <br />You can only imagine my surprise while on the way to school on that Thursday morning hearing on the radio that United Artists had cancelled Friday's opening of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" because of bad reviews. Huh? Pull a movie the day before it's suppose to open? And because of bad reviews? So what, I thought, lots of movies get bad reviews. As most of us old enough to remember know, these were not your ordinary set of bad reviews. They went way beyond saying the movie stunk. Why were the critics so nasty to this one particular film when there were obviously worse ones out there? For that, we will skip ahead four years to the time I rented the VHS tape for my friend - who was quite curious as to whether the movie was as bad as he had heard. And I might add, this still holds true in 2005: <br /> <br />Movie opens in 1870. A graduation ceremony is taking place at Harvard University, where we see a marching band, and several men running to no particular place with the greatest enthusiasm. My friend says the first indication: \\"My God. That's two minutes right there that could have been cut.\\" Unfortunately, we're only 3 minutes into the film. <br /> <br />Now we skip to 1890, and we're now in Casper, Wyoming. The camera stays with Kris Kristofferson as he walks through the streets crowded with horses and buggies, plus seemingly endless supply of people on the sidewalk. Just then my friend starts to laugh. Huh? Did I miss something here? He says, \\"You got to be kidding. There ain't even that many people in Casper, Wyoming NOW.\\" <br /><br />And there you have it. Amongst the historically inaccurate settings, inaudible dialogue, and can't-see action, lies a movie that is screaming \\"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE DAMMIT!!!\\" Starting with frame one, it's as though EVERY camera move and every line of dialogue is being fed to us as though we're suppose to think this is the most awe-inspiring movie experience we're EVER going to see. It shows with EVERY shot being filled with dust or smoke, and those artful pauses between each line of dialogue - provided you can actually hear what's being said, and the actors standing in such a way as to tell us that \\"you're going to hear the most important stuff ever muttered by an actor\\". Every ounce of this movie is so pretentious, I can totally understand why the critics went after it with the gusto in which they did. And through all my own not-nice things I have had to say about it, I do have much sympathy for Cimino, cause I truly believe he thought he was making a masterpiece that would stand the test of time. <br /> <br />But is the movie really THAT bad? I'm going to say no. In the grand scheme of things, worse films have and will continue to be made. And despite the pretentiousness of it all, there are certain camera shots that are breathtaking, and the photography - when it's not dusty - is true eye candy. But 25 years later, alls I can recommend is that you buy the movie, watch it with a group of friends, and discuss while watching the movie where the whole thing went wrong. Sorry, but 25 years later has not made me see this movie any differently - it's still an achingly dull misfire that sank United Artists and became a byword for \\"Big Budget Disaster\\".
B0007YMUZW|4.0|This is the type of album that would have been touted as a 'major statement' back in the 70's.  But obviously the ground has shifted since then, and this album for better or worse has a calculated, 'retro' feel to it.    The worst that the cynics can say is that Ryan Adams is pandering to an aging boomer mentality (which many others besides aging boomers are afficted with), but even the curmudgeonly can't begrudge Adams his talent.  Someone like this doesn't come along that often.    \\"Let it Ride\\" is a little gold nugget of a song with a gorgeous middle-eight (hey, I'm not a musician, but it's the part that goes, \\"I want to see you tonight, dancing in the endless moonlight...\\").  Not everything else on the album rises to that level, but some other songs, like \\"Sweet Illusion\\" and \\"Dance All Night\\" come pretty close.    I would rate this album higher than Stephen Stills' \\"Manassas\\" double elpee, or Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\".  I have to dock it one star for being derivative.  On some of the tunes, the guitar and bass do weave around in figures very reminiscent of Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh.  There seems to be little point in denying that.  If that sound is your cup of tea, wouldn't it  make more sense to pull out your copy of \\"American Beauty\\" instead?
B00080ZG10|3.0|Leo tries too hard.  I like him, but he overacts.  The best reason to see, rent or buy this movie is to find out about the life of Howard Hughes and how he influenced our airline industry and to see Kate Blanchett play an absolutely fabulous version of Katherine Hepburn (she won best supporting actress this year for her portrayal).  Other than that, I'd say this movie was overhyped and overdone.  Not a total loss, but I think this movie could have been so much better had it been a bit more subtle and had someone else played the lead role of Howard Hughes.  Leonardo DiCaprio gave up the Anakin Skywalker role for the Star Wars series for this and Gangs of New York -- I think that was a mistake.
B000002UAU|5.0|The argument over which Beatles album is best will never end with this album vying with Revolver etc for the title.Personally I think it's Abbey Road but Sgt Pepper is very close,and if in the right mood maybe my favorite.These things change ya know! <br />Now the songs,not a weak one among them as the Beatles perfect psychedelic music and make rock music a bonafide art form.As the reviewer states no one took rock seriously until Sgt Pepper though an argument could be made that Revolver also did. The album itself is a melange,yes a melange! of quirky english psychedelia,rock and old style english pop that some would say is the blueprint for brit-pop along with Revolver. Musical escapism at it's best and a testament to the unsurpassed musical genius of the Beatles. <br />Buy!!!
B0007GAERG|2.0|Mariah Carey is not at her best with this CD.  Her songs all sound the same and sound like every other R&B song on the market today.  I am very upset about this.  Mariah has a wonderful voice which she seems unwilling to use the way she used to (unless she can't any longer).  This CD is not worth it.  There is one catchy song on there (Its Like That) which in actuality isn't as good or doesn't have the depth that any of her previous number 1 hits in the 1990's had.<br /><br />If you like the silly, simple minded, cookie-cutter R&B that is currently on the airwaves, then you probably will like this ... BUT, if you liked the sultry, high note and smooth style of Mariah in the 1990's watch out!  Find some way to listen to this CD before you buy.  I listened to the songs on Rapsody.com but I think you can listen to snipets here.
B00097DX3U|4.0|What a great second album from one of the best singers to come out of Seattle. It is not the first album, but still worthy.  <br /> <br />Hey Heritic - if you want to sell your copy let me know....idiots like you SHOULD stick to the Back Street Boys!
630512762X|4.0|The best part about this movie is you get to see both the actors as hero and villian. John and Nicholas acted so nicely, that the idea of whole face/off surgical theme didn't look silly or matter much. Two great actors at their best...
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a deeply compelling book about a young girl \\"Susie Salmon\\" who is raped then murdered. The story starts off with a young girl walking home from school while she is stopped by her next door neighbor Mr. Harvey . Her neighbor then invites her into a \\"little hiding place\\" where he rapes her and murders her. Immediately after Susie Salmon's (like the fish) death, she goes to \\"her heaven\\" where she gets what ever she designers when ever she wants. In her heaven she can look down at her family and observe their every move and their everyday life. She then realizes the impact her death left upon then. <br />  If you are the type of person who loves to read a drama/thriller/exciting book, than this is a must read. This book is wonderfully written, Alice Sebold does a wonderful job on creating such characters and such poetic lines. This book will bring you through so many emotions that you thought you never had, with its intense climatic scenes, and its disturbing descriptions all the way to its nice and happy ending. The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold should be in every school library, and should be read in every English class. This book would be great for the ages of 14-20, because that is the age of the main character \\"Susie\\" and people could relate to her, but this book can be read by any age! I defiantly hope you give The Lovely Bones a chance, because I did, and I loved it, and I know you will as well. <br />
0679746048|4.0|Set in a psychiatric hospital in 1967, it is told by 18-year-old Susanna, who is living under a blanket of depression and spending her days in McLean Hospital near Boston. We see the hospital and its occupants through her eyes, while trying to understand her mental illness (Borderline Disorder). <br />For a difficult subject, this book has a somewhat playful tone. It's as if the halls of McLean hospital are typical corridors of an apartment complex. (\\"It was a perpetual picnic, our hospital.\\") and a \\"seclusion room\\" (\\"Freedom was the price of privacy\\"). Through other characters' stories, Kaysen pieces together the reasons for her own suicide attempt. With each flashback, she reveals more details about her own attempted \\"premeditated murder.\\" She discusses her fears and delusions, wondering if others see them, too. This makes us question ourselves and feel a bit closer to the comfort of being called crazy. Kaysen escorts us on a journey to a \\"parallel universe,\\" creating a direct and clear route in case we travel there ourselves one day. I am hoping that I experience no one going down the same path Kaysen does in the book but I am sure I will. To overall put a score on the book was I would rate it a 9 out of a 10. One thing that was a disappointment was how the film-version of the novel strayed from the truth. I wish the film had been an accurate portrayal of this real life novel. <br />
0151008787|5.0|As I wrote yesterday, but deleted because I don't use my real name, this book is everything the news and customers have posted. I will only add this WARNING. Those of you, who, like myself, read about this book as the story of his mother's suicide, have been given a slanted idea about \\" A Tale of Love and Darkness.\\" Yes, his mother's suicide is here, but far more than that.<br /><br />As others have said better than I: It's a history of Palestine (pre-Israel), the autobiography of a writer, the way that European Jews experienced lower class/lower middle class life Palestine in the late 30's, early 40's, and all the myriad influences and people that created the great Amos Oz, who is surprisingly modest throughout. REALLY modest.<br /><br />Yes, as others have said, Oz is my favorite author. BUT, no one should imagine that this will be an easy read, because it is not. It isn't written to excite;is not plot-driven but meditative and far-ranging, as well as non-linear. It differs from Oz' other work, both novels and non-fiction, in that way. It is a long march and the reader must do some hard work to keep up with chronology and mostly to keep one's interest going.<br /><br />Do not buy this because of a few sensationalist views. Buy this, and yes, I too believe it is a MASTERPIECE, truly AMAZING-- if you are interested in: writing, Israel, Kibbutz life, in exile and hope, in situational despair, in character portraits, and in Oz himself.<br /><br />His mother's death IS utterly wrenching but hardly the main story and his father comes to life through Oz' genius, as well as his unhappy O how unhappy mom. Also, beware that because he meanders hither and yon, when her death happens it hurts, man o does it! During the second section and esp on the last pages I was sobbing, as her life's end is overwhelmingly sad. But whoever I first read claiming this is the story of his mother, I believe was wrong. It is a HUGE travel and the reader needs energy to keep going, to keep interested until at some point, one is simply hooked.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly but for experienced readers only, not looking for a quick fix, nor a page turner. For those who want a panoramtic and highly detailed tale, yes buy this and work it. I'm so glad Amos Oz dared to write a book so different from his other ones as he is a private man, a great one, and he got so much right here. Dig in and don't expect to love it all, not at the beginning. I remember almost every vignette now but it took three tries to get 'in'.o keep interested until at some point, one is simply hooked.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly but for experienced readers only, not looking for a quick fix, nor a page turner.

B000002O4S|5.0|We could say : it is all right. It is interesting but not as good as the movie...Bla...Bla...Bla...But the fact is one is not  the other: the brilliance of the movie was a story well portayed by Michael J. Fox and christopher LLoyd and a fabulous script. <br /> <br />The music has its brilliance by a cool mixture of rock, movie score and songs that reminds you of the movie BUT also feeds some feelings of hope or fun when you day might start the hard way..Now...Isn't that cool enough when a soundtrack does that?
B000683VI4|4.0|I really only have one thing to say about this movie: despite the fact that it is completely dripping in the nectar of sentimentality and appeals to the hopeless romantic inside of us all, THE NOTEBOOK is good story-telling through and through.  You will not be surprised by the plot.  It is a classic tale of star-crossed lovers: she, a rich queen from a well-to-do family, and he, a simple craftsmen from humble beginnings.  Their summer fling is brought short by fate and becomes the focal point of their young lives.  I won't completely reveal the ending, but as Hollywood is wont to do, our lovers do not remain star-crossed forever and we all share a big cry at the end.  Big shocker.<br /><br />But, as I said, despite the fact that THE NOTEBOOK is a sappy love story, it is a moving one all the same.  In particular, I found the \\"present-day\\" love story between James Garner and Gena Rowlands particularly touching.  If nothing else, it helps to break the well-trodden story and provide a bit of originality.  Unfortunately, to do so it simply weaves in another traveled road: a story about a woman losing her memory, only to have moments of clarity brought about by the re-telling of her life's epic love story.  If you do not shed at least one tear during the final scene of this film, you have no soul.  But just keep it at one tear.  I will give the following recommendation: if you enjoy watching romantic stories, THE NOTEBOOK is well-told and will delight you to the ends of the earth.  If you absolutely hate sentimentality, go elsewhere.
1881273156|5.0|I was very skeptical about this book at first.  Now I must admit that it is very insightful and worth reading.  It is amazing how much little things can mean when it is done in someone's love language.  Learning from this book takes a lot of \\"work\\" out of relationships and gives practical advice how to discover and speak others Love Language to make them KNOW that they are special to you.
B00080ZG10|1.0|This was a horrible movie; it could have been about half as long, but Scorsese was trying to win his Oscar.  I am glad that this movie fell way short.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album rocks hard from beginning to end. Mezmerize is the first installment of a planned double-album set, the second part of which will come out sometime later this year with Hypnotize. We can only hope that the second disc is as wildly entertaining as this one. The whole of Mezmerize has a solid urgency and the political enthusiasm that one can only expect from a genuine anger toward the current national trend toward neo-fascism. S.O.A.D. consists of lead singer Serj Tankian, singer-guitarist Daron Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan. The album is marked by spastic, maniacal, insane, and rapidly changing tempos and instrumental styles. I dig this!<br /><br />The album's first single, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is extraordinarily catchy. The vocal artistry ranges from euphonious pop to serious and bombastic operatic histrionics. After a couple of listens, one cannot help but sing along. \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is intensely political, as is much of the album, calling to account a pompous leadership who glibly send other peoples' children to fight their wars. In the midst of exceptionally tight and hard-driving rock and roll rifts, the strong vocal by Tankian and Malakian questions, ''Where the f*** are you? / Why don't presidents fight the war? / Why do they always send the poor? / Why do they always send the poor? / Why do they always send the poor?\\"<br /><br />This album is more than entertainment. It makes an important political statement, and it is an exercize in breathtaking performance art. My only gripe is that it is too short - 38 minutes or so. One of the plusses is that guitarist Daron Malakian gets more vocal time than in previous albums. This compliments Serj Tankian's vocal peformance and adds to the rich tapestry of musical artistry rendered here.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|I don't get what everyone is raving about. This has to be one of the worst albums I have ever purchased. The only redeeming qualities are track 2 and the fact that you can use the CD as a Frisbee.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is an allegory. Not only that, but it is one of the finest movies ever made. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance in the title role. His body language - the curving shoulders, freaky smiles and brooding eyes - reveals an instinctual knowing without the benefit of a complete revelation. His acting is truly outstanding. I'm not saying that anyone else's acting is particularly great or that the special effects are the bomb (they are quite good for a low budget film). What I am saying is that this movie is a multi-dimensional rollercoaster ride that you don't even realize that you are on until it's too late to get off. The closest thing I can relate it to is Twelve Monkeys. But Donnie Darko goes farther and deeper and asks more questions. It is haunting and humorous and even a little scary. If you are a person given to flights of philosophical fancy or theological speculation, (or even if you like reading Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku), you will love this movie. But be prepared! You will have to watch the movie over and over again, and each time you do the allegory becomes fuller and fuller as the revelation opens.<br /><br />Now, my interpretation of the allegory may not be anyone else's. I would be quite interested in hearing other points of view. But here is my idea in a nutshell...<br /><br />The wrinkle in time is this present world<br /><br />Donnie Darko is the Christ figure (hence, his mother = Mary; father = Joseph)<br /><br />Jim Cunnigham is the devil (Or is Frank the devil and Jim the Antichrist?)<br /><br />Gretchen Ross is the Church<br /><br />Kittie Farmer is Self-righteous churchianity (as opposed to The Two Teachers, below)<br /><br />Roberta Sparrow/Grandma Death is the Bible (by way of her book The Philosophy of Time Travel)<br /><br />The Two Teachers (Noah Wyle and Drew Barrymore) represent conscientious but silenced clergy - the prophetic voice<br /><br />The wrinkle in time in which the story takes place is the world as we know it. Donnie gives up his life so that his beloved might live, but in the process he changes everyone and everything. Even Jim Cunningham - the evil molester who, because of the death of Donnie may not even be found out - is reduced to tears, perhaps knowing that everything has changed. The world as a whole will never be the same again.<br /><br />Okay, you philosophers and movie wizards... what does the fat man in the jogging suit represent? What about Frank? What is he really? Or the psychiatrist? Or Sparkle Magic? What does Donnie's older sister represent? Frank is her boyfriend! Frank also is the oracle that cause Donnie to act. Lots of stuff I just haven't figured out yet!!!!<br /><br />First time writer/director Richard Kelly has created a real gem here. The film already has a hardy cult following and will become, I think, the theologian's and philosopher's Rocky Horror Picture Show.is the world as we know it.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I love this album, but in a way different from my brother, the only other person I know who listens to it (I don't really discuss Radiohead anyway.) I listen to this album as a way of relaxing, and for that it gets 5 stars. I actually cut Knives Out from the album because it kept waking me up as I was going to sleep. <br /> <br />Some may think that because of my above comment, it is almost as if I am bashing the album, but the fact is it fills a very important hole in my life, and for that, why not give it such a high mark? <br /> <br />All I know is that the first time I was listening to it, before I knew who Radiohead was, I just sat there and was so at peace with myself, I was astounded. I begged my friend to borrow her copy so I could listen to it at home, and did such repeatedly. I'm not a Radiohead groupie, hell, this is the only Radiohead album I listen to, and I love it.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I expected this to be just another slasher film with unnecessary nudity and people running upstairs instead of down. But, it's actually nothing like that surprisingly. This is a fresh feel to a horror movie, probably seen before, but hasn't been done to death over the past few years.    The movie starts off a bit confusing, but you pick up on whats going on. It starts off showing the two main actors, already stuck in their prison that the villain has placed them in. They're locked in chains, have no idea how they got there and don't know what is going on. As it goes on, they find these sort of clues, and have to solve little riddles or something while a clock is running down. If they run out of time, pay the consequences. Also it follows a story of an ex-cop played by Danny Glover who is on the hunt for the \\"Jigsaw\\" killer. During the movie there are flashbacks to things the main actors are remembering from their pasts, trying to remember how they got into the situation they are in, what they had heard, who they thought it was, who they where etc...    It's hard to say anything really without giving away the whole deal. So I'll just say, this an interesting movie because every-time you think you predict something, you don't! Plus it's interesting that the killers actions aren't murder, he puts his victim in a situation where if they want to live, they must make sacrifices to stay alive.
0425129616|5.0|This book set the standard for all classics to come by A.C. and even her successors of the genre.    In TMAAS, to say that the plot was a brilliant concoction of A.C. would be a severe understatement. I'm obviously a fan of A.C., but I'm even a bigger fan of the classic style evident in this book:The confined setting, the uncomlicated, yet tightly woven plot, the intimacies amongst the suspects, and an almost invisible veil of pressure for the crime solver to expose the culprit. A.C. served up heaping helpings of this and then some. I'd be redundant if I replicated the description of the plot, but I will say that the formula would not be unfamiliar to the common reader: The weatlhy heiress is murdered, the would be benefactors of her inheritance become the obvious suspects, and the sleuth steals the show to tell whodunit.    The only reservation I had was that A.C.'s prose could have been a bit less heavy-handed. The dated English vernacular was a bit much at times. Also,there were a few severely politically incorrect references made that could possibly dissuade a sensitive reader (keep in mind that the book was written in 1910 and pub'd in 1920),however, the die-hards of mystery/A.C. will take them w/ a grain of salt.    I highly recommend this book to readers who've never read A.C. before. In doing so, the reader will kill two birds w/ one stone:They will read the 1st book ever written by A.C.(introducing the extraordinary Hercule Poirot),and experience the phenomenal and undisputed A.C. style that has become one of America's favorite age old pleasures.
B000002O1P|4.0|The mega-hit \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\", to be exact. Many of the other songs are the reason I don't drop this album to two stars. \\"Rebels\\" starts you thinking this album is a worthy follow-up to \\"Hard Promises\\". The title track later on is a powerful, introspective piano-voice ballad. Some listeners looking for a continuation of driving rock may find it \\"boring\\", but don't get me started on that type of \\"boredom\\". Believe me, this song kicks booty. But that MTV-drivel \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\". The lyrics are contrived, you get the sense that the main aim was for the lines to rhyme. That mid-Sixties sitar arrangement is more consistent with the pointless psychedelia renaissance than with a Tom Petty album. That sort of crapola is lame even as a parody. And the video! Ever since that came out, everyone looking to depict Petty for whatever entertainment purpose has him in that dorky Mad Hatter hat. I'm sure there were trick-or-treaters the following Halloween wearing \\"Tom Petty\\" costumes. The chief advantage of the CD is that you can program around that song. Which I suggest you do as you listen to this album's good stuff.

0345347951|5.0|Everytime I read a book or short story by Arthur C. Clarke I fall from one amazement into another. Like in the Rama series he always knows how to let you know that there is something going on which you will find out a little later, so you keep on reading. <br /> <br />This book is no different but it's one of Clarke's best. Again he knows to blend science, occultism and even religion into one great story. <br /> <br />A group of aliens come to earth and hover their ships above the great cities of the world (think Independance Day), they are not out for the ruling of the world but know to end war and poverty within a few years and mankind enters a golden age. After 50 years they finally make themselves known and they look a lot like the old medieval devil images. Later the children of the world enter a new phase of existence (another common Clarke theme) and the world enters a new phase. <br /> <br />Be surprised all over again, a magnificent read
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Pardon me while I wipe the tears away.  If you judge a film by the amount of copious fluids you excrete from your person then \\"Team America-World Police\\" is an outright masterpiece.  All kidding aside, this was the funniest film of 2004 and will inevitably achieve classic status.  This is probably the crowning moment of Parker and Stone's repertoire.  The beauty of this film is that I know both liberals and conservatives who are just as effusive in their fervor for this film.  The film's targets, global politics, Hollywood activism, high-voltage action films to name a few, are skewered brilliantly.  The puppets are stunning and expressive.  The miniature sets and visuals are breath-taking.  Like other Parker and Stone ventures the film has a great song score.  If you're not easily offended or have a slightly askew sense of humor \\"Team America\\" is the film for you.  Dirka, Dirka!
B0007GAERG|5.0|In all honesty its been a while since i came upon an album that truly contains real and genuine singles. i love to collect cds but recently it seems most artists are deceptive. they release one amazing single and thats it. period. one nice song is enough to fool music lovers into buying an album. i almost gave up. as a matter of fact i did. i quit buying records except when alicia keys or josh stone release one. until i discovered mariah's new gem, the emancipation of mimi. i read the reviews here in amazon.com and felt like this album must be something. ive always loved mariah and her music. a have all her albums except glitter. but the last one charmbracelet was a downer. so it took me sometime to decide and buy the album. when i got hold of it, i had never felt better. all songs and i mean all are wonderful. you can really tell that blood and sweat have poured just to make each a masterpiece. u can truly feel that each song has gone through a lot. each song sounds different. but each one sounds nice as well. it is as if all songs are made to be released as a single. i am blown away buy this album. never have my ears been treated so wonderfully. real music is back in one heck of a real and genuine album. mariah shows again that one should never lose hope. so do we.
B00065U08Q|3.0|better than most albums ive ever heard. All Johns albums from TROWFTD till Curtains are 5 stars except this album, which ironically i was looking most forward to. <br /> <br />THe low point is that it couldve been a whole lot better. For starters its too short considering the tracks move slowly as it, and should be atleast double the amount of songs to be really good, and despite being short, some songs could be better \\"walls\\".  <br /> <br />Although the josh tracks and the track \\"THe afterglow are great and af the whole album wasnt as rushed and done in the same vein as in those songs, the album would be great. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Curtians\\" and \\"The will to death\\" are my absolute favourite albums ever, so its fine to let one album slip, while im still absorbing the greatness from his other albums.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Mezmerize sounds like the band wasn't even trying.  There are maybe two or three decent songs on this strangely short album, and allowing their guitarist to scream and wail throughout half the album was one of the worst decisions in the history of music.  Not only is Serj sidelined, but the lyrics are no longer surreal and political in an interesting-if-stupid way like they were in Toxicity and Steal This Album.  Now the lyrics have crossed the line to being just plain stupid.  They alternate between banal, uncreative political whining and complete nonsense. <br /> <br />Skip this album and hope like hell that Hypnotize turns out better.
B0006399FS|5.0|I bought this album the night it came out. I will admit that it took me one listen to get attached but once i sat through it once I was hooked. Of course I know its not their best album (though I do think it belongs in the top 5). The Joshua Tree will always be considered their best and that will never change. I firmly disagree with anyone who thinks that this album is the next Joshua Tree or Acthung. Even a monkey could see thats not the case. After that, it could be War but I think this one is next in line. Needless today, its the best U2 since Acthung Baby and you are foolish if you think otherwise. People are missing the whole thing about what U2 is all about. The key word is experimentation. They did it the Joshua Tree and Acthung. They've been doing it throughout the 90's. They did it at the turn of the millenium with ATYCLB. Here once again they are experimenting, this time on a bit more of a political and personal level in regards to the songs themselves. With the actual production of the songs, it feels as if the band digs back to their basic roots, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The opening five songs could be the best opening we've heard on a U2 album since the Joshua Tree. Vertigo (once you get past the millions of times it has gotten airplay) is alot like Elevation from ATYCLB. Nowhere near the best U2 song but it holds you over for some better work and it opens an album perfectly. Miracle Drug and Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own could be the best 2-3 punch we've seen from U2 to date. The former ties in emotions with politics (I get the feeling it is an anti-\\"pull the plug\\" song, U2 being probobly the most pro-life group on the market). It features beautiful lyrics: \\"Freedom has a scent like the top of a newborn baby's head\\" is the most memorable line. \\"Sometimes\\" is a personal statement from Bono, to his father who died in 2001. Bono sings his heart out and you can feel his passion. Anyone who thinks he sold out for this album should listen to this song if they want to be proven wrong. \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is an anti-war statement no doubt aimed at the War in Iraq. Although it may get drowned in liberal politics, if you look at it as a song it is quite impressive. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is an absolutley incredible song. It might be the best song on the album, or close to it. From the intro to the powerful bridge to the striking conclusion everything about it screams classic U2. the album takes off in another direction from tracks 6 to 11. \\"All Because of You\\" is the second single. Here we hear U2 stripped down. Hard guitar riffs, screaming lyrics, incredible bass line, gets U2 away from its poprock 90's appeal. \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is the first of three \\"subpar\\" songs. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\" are three weaker U2 attempts but that is to be expected. Like I sayd, this album is not like The Joshua Tree in which every song was basically a gem. At \\"Original of the Species\\" U2 mixes rock with pop, in a Beatlesque performance which I think works very well, contrary to many beleifs. The lyrics are great, the melody is catchy, and the song means something which is hard to say about many rock performances today. The last song, \\"Yahweh\\", is a religous cry and one of the better U2 closers. \\"Take this mouth, so quick to criticize, take this mouth give it a kiss\\" is a brilliant line which basically sums up the album. Love, and then do what you want, which is basically what U2 has been trying to say since 1980. The album is great, and I think in time people will begin to see that.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Saving private ryan was a good movie, but i always wanted more character development, more battles, stories upon the stories and the whole scope of the company, regiment and battalion, Band of Brothers delivers that wish and more. Excellent portrayal of the heros who were in those situations, and the true to life stories the series is based on are heartfelt and honest.
B0002858YS|5.0|Yeah I have a reputation of being 100% metal on this site, but I assure fellow readers that I have an open mind. I did enjoy these guys alot. I don't listen to the radio, so the so called \\"singles\\" aren't old to me. While every song is very good on this CD, the best song, IMO is Mr. Brightside. I did really enjoy this CD and I think it deserves a place in everyone's CD library. Pick this up if you're into this style of music.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|When I frist got this album I liked it more then I do now.The only reason why I gave it 3 star's Is that it has very good singing on it.The music and lyric's on the other hand are so so.The music itself is more pop/rock then what musical's music is really like.If you like the pop/rock sound of musical's then this album may be for you .
B00097DX3U|5.0|As a fan of the blues, I have often found myself, in the last decade or so, torn between my appreciation for a heavy riff and drum beat, and the technical skill of the blues or classical music. While bands like Metallica have all but abandoned any semblence of \\"how'd they do that\\" guitar playing or drumming, Audioslave (along with Tool) remains a bright spot. Tom Morello has always been a player who makes you wonder what kind of effects he using, or what the hell he is doing to that poor guitar to get that sound out of it, but his work with Audioslave also proves that he has a heart for the blues and more traditional, technically astute leads. And the whole band has a very \\"old skool\\" sound to it. Every time I hear them, I am taken back to the days of Led Zeppelin or the Doors. And the straight up (not that fake, rap crap) funk contained on their 2 great albums is very refreshing. I did like Rage and Soundgarden, but as a mucician myself, I realized that when a band moves on stylistically, you should expect them to try some different things...and when (essentially) 2 great bands become one, you are very lucky if the result is Audioslave.
140003180X|2.0|I have read 4 of the #1 ladies books and the first one was great then all the books started to go down in my books. Lots of people like the sequals but I dont I find they have no life, there boring and flat. This book is all of that but at times is o.k. when they add mystery. I am no longer going to read the other books becouse I am really dissapointed in the series.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I am one of those guys who really digs albums that the rest of my friends just don't seem to get. I've read a lot of reviews from people who seem to think this album is terrible (and sales seem to say that a lot of people agree). I'll be honest and admit, I am a very new fan of NIN. If it helps, I was pretty turned off by \\"The Hand That Feeds\\"... that is the worst track on this album. I love songs like \\"Head like a hole\\", and \\"Hurt\\" really hooked me. I'm not a guy who only likes a very specific musical genre. I love Tool, Radiohead, Led Zepelin, System of a Down, Mars Volta, U2, Incubus, and A Perfect Circle. With Teeth was actually recommended to me by a friend, who also is into widely varied and eclectic musical tastes as well. This album features some amazingly creative instrumentation (yes, the lyrics could have been written by a 14 year old \\"wannabe\\" goth, but to their credit, I often find myself singing them in my head). The melodies, beats, and \\"what the hell did he sample here?\\" mistique is there. Maybe not as much so as on previous albums, but in my opinion, With Teeth is up there with System of A Down's \\"Mesmerize\\" as one of my favorite albums released this year (and it has not left my cd player for 2 weeks now). One more thing, I am a fairly well known musician myself, and this album will likely be a tremendous influence my music for some time to come.

B00079FUI6|5.0|I only started watching this show at episode 18, but DH has quickly beome my favorite series. I absolutely love the storylines and the way each of the characters interacts.<br /><br />For anyone who's never seen it, here's a quick run-down of the show:<br /><br />In the first episode, the narrator of the series, Mary Alice Young, kills herself. It's later discovered by her neighbors that she was being blackmailed, and committed suicide to hide her secrets. The four wives of Wisteria Lane spend the rest of the season searching for clues that might help solve the mystery behind Mary Alice's past. The clues pile up; from a tape stolen from a marriage counselor, to a baby blanket embroidered with the name \\"Dana\\".<br /><br />Bree Van De Kamp is the epitome of the Stepford Wife - perky, resourceful, and perfect in almost every way. Except for one thing: her family thinks she's psychotic. Her husband wants a divorce, and is later caught up in a sex scandel when another wife's little black book surfaces. Bree and Rex have an on-again-off-again relationship, and two children, Andrew and Danielle. Andrew is a seemingly-average kid, except that he runs over a helpless older woman, gets caught smoking weed, confesses an affinity for homosexuality to Bree and Rex, and confesses to a local priest of his plans to make his mother's life a living Hell. Danielle, the 4th, seldom-seen Van De Kamp, is probably the most normal of the group. Further complicating their lives is George, a local pharmacist. Attempting to get back at Rex, Bree starts seeing George, but breaks it off when a reconciliation seems possible. However, George hasn't gotten over his feelings for Bree, and has a tricks up his sleeves.<br /><br />Next is Gabrielle Solis. A once-famous runway model, she married Carlos for his money, not realizing that he was marrying her as a trophy wife. Unsatisfied with how things have gone in their marriage, Gabrielle seeks fulfilment in their gardener, 17-year-old John. Their affair is nearly discovered by Juanita, Carlos' mother, but she is run down by Andrew Van De Kamp, and later dies, before passing on her discovery. Carlos, desperate for children, starts tampering with Gabrielle's birth control pills, much to Gabrielle's dismay when she finds out.<br /><br />Then there is Lynnette Scavo. Once a top-notch ad-exec, Lynnette has since traded in her PowerPoint presentations for diapers and parent-teacher conferences. The mother of 4 (a baby girl and 3 boys, two of whom are twins), she spends each day trying not to rip her hair out dealing with the boys. Tom Scavo, Lynnette's husband, is a busy advertiser, and spends most of his time on business trips. Lynnette becomes suspicious of Tom, and also deals with a drug dependency at one point.<br /><br />Finally, there is Susan Mayer. A single mother, she has a funny way of making a mess out of every situation. From burning AND under-cooking macaroni and cheese to burning down her neighbor's house, her clumsyness has no limits. Her 14-year-old daughter, Julie, seems more mature than her, and ends up doing the recon work when Susan gets a crush on new neighbor, the mysterious Mike Delfino.<br /><br />Secrets abound on Wisteria Lane. The only way to see them all is to get this DVD set and watch the series. You're never going to find another series as complex and complicated as Desperate Housewives.ir affair is nearly discovered by Juanita, Carlos' mother, but she is run down by Andrew Van De Kamp, and later dies, before passing on her discovery.

0743454529|5.0|Best book I've read in years.  Compelling and amazingly written.  I loved the format and the topic!!!
037571457X|5.0|I've heard great things about this book and was afraid I would be disappointed b/c of all the hype.  In fact, I was truly touched by the humor, humanity, wit, and tragedy artfully conveyed by Marjane Satrapi.  I know the outlines of the Iranian Revolution and this is surely one of the most accessible and powerful works of art to emerge from that period.  Regardless of your background and interest in either comics or Iran, you will be engrossed by this beautiful, funny, and graceful work of art.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Ehh, I actually don't like this CD a whole lot. It is very, VERY repetitive. Over and over the same words. Sure some of the other albums have done the same, but this is overboard. And I do agree that there is too much Daron. I like him getting more air time but this is just too much. They are much more face paced now too. Almost every song is super fast words to the point where you have no clue what they are talking about. Aside from that, I like the guitar riffs. BYOB is still a good song though, along with Question!. Those are probably the only 2 songs I listen to a lot on this album. <br />The most recent CD I bought that blew me away was Fall Out Boy - From Under the Cork Tree. I remember the days when I bought a new CD from a band, it was always awesome. Just seems like a lot of music is getting worse.
B00006690G|5.0|Well what's their to say, the album doesnt have any bad tracks, the tracks that aren't great are \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" and \\"When The Music Stops\\". the rest of the album is pretty good, my favourite tracks are \\"Business\\" \\"Cleanin' out My Closet\\" \\"Square Dance\\" \\"Drips\\" \\"Without Me\\" \\"Superman\\" \\"Haile's Song\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\". \\"Till I Collapse\\" is real good also. 2 bad his next release \\"Encore\\" was awful :( <br />The Eminem Show is not a disappointment though and i do recommend this to u all ! !
B0007OCG56|4.0|I have never been an Adam Sandler fan; however, this movie is really wonderful. Sandler has matured as an actor and is apparently taking roles with more meat and less physical comedy. His character is the polar opposite of Tea Leoni's. His love for their children and his understanding of human nature just shine through. Leoni is perfect as the neurotic, narcissistic wife and mother. A wonderful foil to Sandler's even tempered character. While you might think this is a great date movie, I think it's a better married with children couple date movie. Lots of truisms here. Favorite line: When Leoni's character tells her mother she isn't helping with her low self esteem, and the mother replies \\" these days your low self esteem is just good common sense\\". Sandler just might make it to my must see list for the future. <br />
B00005QZWI|5.0|After a lot of careful consideration I have chosen to rank this soundtrack as the second greatest that I have ever heard.  (Second only to the Return of the King.)  Many, many people have commented that Howard Shore is one of the greatest composers ever, possibly second only to John Williams.  I however, must disagree.  Howard Shore has proven in the soundtracks for all three Lord of the Rings films that his talents can far outshine even those of John Williams.  (Williams fans don't get me wrong. He is my second favorite composer, I love his music and think that he has produced some of the greatest theme songs ever.) However, what makes Shore stand out to me is the fact that every song on this cd is a SONG!  What do I mean?  Well, if you ever have the chance, listen to the soundtracks to Jurassic Park or Star Wars and you will see that all too often John Williams composes music that has no real emotional value; the music is nothing more a few horn toots or string slurs that do little more than irritate.  The theme songs that Williams writes are  hauntingly beautiful and easily recognizable but they only appear on a few of the tracks on the cd with the rest of the cd consisting of what I like to call \\"the orchestra is warming up now\\" music.  Shore manages to tell a story in his music and I have found that as I to listen to not only a few, but every song on this track I think WOW! Williams is great when he's composing a movie's main theme(s) but Shore takes the cake for all around movie music masterpiece.
B000003ER4|5.0|I had the great good fortune to see, and more importantly, to hear New York City Opera's production of this nearly forgotten work with the astonishing team of soprano Carol Neblett, tenor John Alexander (for whom, it is said, NYCO mounted the production), and conductor Julius Rudel.  It is an experience I have never forgotten. <br /> <br />It was to have been revived the following season with Carol Neblett, who was moving on to other things, to be replaced by the estimable soprano Johanna Meier.  Unfortunately, the opera was met with stunning indifference by audiences, and the second season performances were cancelled.  Too bad. <br /> <br />This recording preserves the performance of the vastly underrated Neblett, adds the veteran baton of Erich Leinsdorf to the mix, and, because of bizarre German musician's union regulations, replaces the magnificent Paul of American tenor John Alexander with the decidedly inferior work of the German Rene Kollo, a singer who, with perhaps all the best intentions, was simply not up to the job.  He has the unfortunate ability to do just the opposite of Alexander in this role.  Whereas the vocally secure Alexander tended to take the most difficult passages of this score in stride, Mr. Kollo manages to make them sound even more difficult than they really are, no small feat. <br /> <br />That grumbling aside, this is a wonderful recording of an opera which, truth be told, may not be to everyone's taste, but which assuredly is to mine.  The truth of the matter is Korngold had the heart of an operetta composer - lovely melodies crowding upon each other, with the prodigious compositional skills of a Richard Strauss.  Not always a comfortable combination.  But when it works, as with the famous 1st Act Aria/Duet and the breathtaking Appparition Scene which follows, it REALLY works! <br /> <br />The recorded sound here is just about perfect, showing yet again how good analog recording had become near the end of its' run. <br /> <br />A musthave recording.
B000002I2I|4.0|Morrison Hotel/Hard Rock Caf&eacute; is a well influenced blues/rock album, and by many critics, is considered a prime choice for Doors albums. Although maybe not as psychadelic as some other efforts, it is very artistic and poetic in rockish sense.<br /><br />The first side is easily the best, beginning with the heavy rocker, Roadhouse Blues, an instant hit with killer lyrics and an awesome metal riff. The album doesn't slow down from there taking us into Waiting For The Sun, a beautiful, poetic composition with a masterful chorus. You Make Me Real is a good, energetic rocker, and Peace Frog is a thrilling track, especially for its killer basslines at the beginning and unbelievable guitar riffs. A slower track comes with Blue Sunday and it is fairly well done, but Ship Of Fools gives it a much needed lift, with a great, rock based melody. Land Ho! is a solid rocker. The Spy has some nice keyboards and is a pretty ballad.<br />Morrison closes out with a nice bluesy number, Maggie Mcgill, The Doors giving us strong instrumental performances, with obvious blues roots built into nice keyboard vibes and spins.<br /><br />Morrison Hotel achieves success with certain key components where some Doors albums didn't. I found the key to its success was consistency, as it stays very rooted to the essential theme of the album, and no track really breaks away from that theme. Lyrically exceptional as always, and it features easily one of the Doors greatest rockers, Roadhouse Blues. An absolute must for  diehard Doors fans, and possibly essential for the casual fan too, featuring some great rock numbers that most 60s rock listeners can appreciate. All in all a great album, and highly recommended.
B000003TA4|1.0|This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music?? I'm serious... <br /> <br />This type of music, known by most in the Ward as \\"Rock\\" or \\"Metal\\" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano. <br /> <br />Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan. If you are like me, you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever. <br /> <br />I hate rock and roll and I have taken it upon myself as my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the Holy Mormon Church.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Would all you people who claim to be S.O.A.D. fans please shut the ----up about how short the cd is or how this is not like their other releases!!  I am sick and tired of hearing you little youngins cry.  This cd is a splendid mix of thrash and weirdness that has made the band so popular.  This is probably their catchiest release yet, fun to sing along to like their past releases.  Yes they are extremely popular but that has not gotten in the way of them thrashing it up on this one and having some extremely heavy parts.  Daron does sing alot more and that is fine because it works, even though Serj still has one of the most interesting and unique vocals around.  No need to go over the songs, they all rock, except for the last track, which is a lame ending to a great cd.  Still minor quibbles.  If you liked all of the band's other efforts you will no doubt enjoy this.  Even though my forte is Death Metal comparing this to Death Metal releases is pointless even though some jerks will.  They will say if you want true heaviness go and get this or that band's cd, stupidity.  If you're one to complain all the time and find fault in everything a band puts out then go and complain about it, no one is listening to you losers.  Great cd.  Buy or Die!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|This band is a welcome return of the 80s tunes I remember dancing to in the mirror of my room!!! It's reminiscent of an era whose music has fallen to the wayside. When's the last time you heard something on the radio that gets you grooving in your car? Think Molly Ringwald movie soundtrack with this CD. It's a phenomenal tribute to bands like Dead or Alive, YAZ and New Order. Fans who appreciate these other icons will not be disappointed with The Killers.
0321334876|4.0|[A review of the 3rd EDITION 2005].<br /><br />This seems to be for a C++ programmer who has moved beyond mastery of the basic syntax. Ok, you can implement a set of interrelated classes and get everything compiled and run. But, and you're aware of this, there may be refinements in coding that elude you. So Meyers offers a cookbook of 55 improvements. I'd agree with the cover's claim that these recipes are indeed specific enough to be useful. Take the suggestion about deferring variable definitions as long as possible. This minimises the chance of creating unused variables, which has an attendant cost in computing and memory, if the compiler is not smart enough to omit them. Plus, there is a cost in harder coding and debugging, if the definition of a variable is many screens before its first usage. Such a contrast with earlier languages like C or Fortran, where you have to define all the variables upon entry to a subroutine. This example also shows an unheralded merit of the book. A bunch of recipes are also germane in other OO languages like Java.<br /><br />The only gripe I have is with the suggestion of declaring data variables private. I certainly agree with it. But this is one of the first things you learn in any introductory text on an OO language. It really seems unnecessary here, unless the author is just padding out the book.
B000003TA4|5.0|I don't know what this priest's problem is, this is one of the best records in the diverse history of rock. I think this guy should be sent straight to the lowest depths of hell, where only Judas Escariot resides, for saying anything bad about Kurt Cobain (one of the best song writers ever). I hope this guy gets sent to prison for abusing his children, and raped by a very large man with AIDS. The only thing we need to rid the world of is him and all the backwards thinkers that reside with him. If I ever see him at his church, I will crucify him in front of it.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|what's happening to SOAD?  is daron taking over the entire band?  after listening to the tracks on mezmerize, it almost sounded like serj was doing background vocals.      sure...the cd has its redeeming moments: radio/video, revenga, question!    but the fact remains...there isn't enough serj!  catchy SOAD style riffs, great lyrics...but theres just so much more potential for this band.  what happened to the good old days...the old school system, toxicity...     it took a while to grow on the album which is actually decent.  but for system fans everywhere who love the hard core, solid, harmonic, old school SOAD...look elsewhere.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In this day of music, where everyone wants to tune their guitars down low and all sound the same, Audioslave is a breath of fresh air to the music industry.  They are looked at as being a supergroup, but they completely stand on their own, independent of their \\"original\\" sounds.  Audioslave has managed to take my favorite part of Soundgarden, Chris Cornell, and of Rage Against the Machine, Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk, and put them together.  Cornell's vocals blend well with the music put up by the rest of Audioslave.  Morello gets a lot of credit for his guitar playing, but Commerford and Wilk are no slouches either.  Both are tremendous musicians and excel greatly in what they do. This album rocks right from the opening chords of \\"Cochise\\" on to the end.  These 4 brilliant musicians definitely excel better together than they did with their former acts.  Anyone out there looking for a good rock cd with some catchy guitar riffs, this is your cd.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm a little late with a review, but I was late getting the album for the simple fact that I really did not totally dig the last couple of albums.. There are always some good songs on each one, but repetition seemed to be getting the better of the group.. Well they totally threw my opinion out the door when I listened to this cd.. I dont know where to begin, well yes I do.. Jesus of Suburbia.. That is the most Un-Green Day song you will ever hear, but yet do they still manage to keep it simple in its 9 minute entirety? You bet your sweet a$$ they do.. Its absolutely brilliant and retro to boot.. After that song i seriously gave the rest of the album a decent try and I'm glad I did.. There are two songs that I dont care for (the 2 slow ones), but the rest of the album more than makes up for them.. The cd is worth getting on many levels, but my favorite thing is how they have reinvented themselves which I think is the key to any lasting groups stay power.. This album would be the Rubber Soul or Revolver for Green Day... Yes I just compared it to two of the greatest rock cd's of all-time.. Own this gem and I guarantee you will be keeping this cd close at hand in your car and certainly on top of your entertainment center.. \\"Somebody get me out of here!\\"

B00009V7P8|5.0|I have found my favorite album of the year with Damien Rice's \\"O\\".  I am not afraid to shout that from the top of the tallest mountain or from the bottom of every ocean.  When friends ask me, from now on, who I think is one of the best singer/songwriters out there, it will be very easy for me to reply \\"my friends, it is Damien Rice\\".  Never before have I witnessed such passion, emotion, and consistency as I did with this album.  It just oozes sincerity and epitomizes the true meaning of folk music.<br /><br />While I am not afraid to admit that I found him when I watched the film Closer, and was pulled in by his song \\"the blower's daughter\\", I quickly discovered there was more to him than what this film allowed.  While I do think \\"the blower's daughter\\" is nothing short of perfection, there are other songs that I think better represent the overall tune of Rice.  My favorites on the album are such:<br /><br />1) Volcano<br /><br />2) Cannonball<br /><br />3) Eskimo (with a brilliant orchestra finale)<br /><br />4) Cold Water<br /><br />In fact, I am not afraid to admit that there isn't one song on this album that I do not like.  I have placed this CD into my surround sound system at home and do not intend for it ever to leave.  This is the type of music that you can listen to when you need to relax, reflect, or just enjoy the bits and pieces of your life.  It is the type of music that forces you to remember that you are alive and to take each moment, each day, and embrace it for everything that it is worth.<br /><br />The consistent tone and raw emotion behind Rice's vocals is by far the most impressive.  His poetic lyrics remind me of early Dave Matthews moments, while the welcomed intrusion of Lisa Hannigan left my jaw on the ground.  Why hasn't his music become more popular here in America?  Honestly, I have never been so impressed with an album purchase as I was with this one.  The simplistic packaging of the disc and bold artwork only force you to sit on your couch and become engulfed with the intrinsic tunes that Rice offers us.<br /><br />I cannot speak any better of this album, if Amazon would allow me to give it more than five stars I would.  For those folk music fans that are looking for that quintessential album that fully represents the genre, this is the one for your collection.  I am impressed, and cannot wait to see what else Damien has for us in the future.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****nd become engulfed with the intrinsic tunes that Rice offers us. <br /> <br />I cannot speak any better of this album, if Amazon would allow me to give it more than five stars I would.

B00003CXCT|4.0|The long awaited DVD boxset is back and badder than ever, and chock full `o' nuts - and by \\"nuts\\" I mean special features, crystal clear digitally restored movies, and lots of gizmos.  Get it in wiiiiiiiiiiiiiide screen for full Kung Fu effect.   <br /> <br />It delivers what it promises and promises what it delivers.  Its tall on promise and short on delivery - wait... anyway, the Star Wars Trilogy presents the future, and who knows the future better than Molvania's own techno-pop duo, Zlad!  \\"Supersonik - Electronik\\" <br /> <br />\\"Hey baby, wake up from your asleep.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've always been a modest SOAD fan, but i was needing some new music to rock out to, so i was reading new 2005 cd releases and i saw \\"mezmerize\\" may 17th, that was it! So from about mid-march i've been waiting for that day and now it's come! Tracks: <br />1.Soldier Side-Intro:7/10..Well it's as simple as that, an \\"intro\\" but a beautiful one at that. It really kicks off the album well. <br />2.B.Y.O.B.:9/10..I really love this song, even though i've heard it tons of times, who hasn't? But still it's a nice sign that SOAD is approaching a new direction with this one.. <br />3.Revenga:10/10..I absolutely hated this song when i got the cd. I ended up kicking myself for it, i have no idea why i didn't like it. Great song, changes tempo numerous times <br />4.Cigaro:8/10...Another one everybody's heard, i still find it funny, the first time i heard this on the radio i couldn't believe what i was hearing, but this is a good song just to rock out to and maybe even have a good laugh to. <br />5.Radio/Video:9/10..Another one that i initially didn't care for, but it without a doubt grew on me, it's quite different (yes even for soad) with a polka kind of reggea feel to it. Changes melodies tons of times like most of the album. <br />6.This Cocaine...:7/10..The beggining of this song is my favorite on the cd, with the guitars hitting hard and pausing every other 2 seconds with only the cymbals playing, the rest of the song is pretty decent, another funny one. The only part that kind of annoys me is when serj says \\"killers never hurt feelings\\" he says it in a very unusual way. <br />7.Violent Pornography:10/10...My second favorite on the cd. This song is just fantastic, my favorite part is the pre-chorus where serj spits out \\"non-stop disco bet you it's nabisco! bet you didn't know hoo hoo!\\" <br />8.Question!10/10..My favorite on the cd, i just love how the acoustic blends so well w/the riff, i'm surprised alot more people don't like this song, it's definitely single worthy. <br/>9.Sad Statue:10/10..My 3rd favorite, the beginning riff begins right after question, you don't even get time to think, the verses rock very hard, but then they surprise you with a soft melodic chorus..this and byob are the most political songs on Mezmerize. <br />10.Old School Hollywood:6/10..This is the reason why Daron shouldn't be singing as much as he does on this cd, the only part i absolutely hate is the verses where Daron sings in nausiating fashion, but the chorus and guitars are very good. <br />11.Lost In Hollywood:9/10..Easily the softest soad song ever, even spiders and aerials have their heavy parts, but this song remains soft and melodic through out. Daron sings good on this song, but i believe if serj sings this song, it's better =/ But you gotta give credit where credit is due. <br />Overall:A great album, probably my second favorite behind the self titled, but the one obvious flaw would be the over use of Daron, there is no need for serj to become back up vocals on 70% of the songs, he's much too talented of a vocalist for that, and Daron, although a superb guitarist, about 95% of the time i can do without his voice...Great CD, now i'm just waitin' for Hypnotize
B0007DAZW8|2.0|After another four-year wait, Daft Punk officially return with a relative clunker that was recorded in just 6 weeks from what I understand. The real shame is that there are still some killer riffs to be found here but they are played out with the utmost minimalism lacking any variation or increasing complexity. Songs -- or should I say vignettes? -- that would have been satifying at a neat 3 minutes are dragged out to close to 5 minutes for almost no apparent reason other than to pad this sparse album's playtime. The title track \\"Human After All\\"  is the clearly shining track on the album, setting the rest of the album up for disappointment. Other singles like \\"Robot Rock\\" feature great riffs but quickly wear out their welcome when the 4-minute mark is reached and there's hardly anything to show for it. Daft Punk have always been about a certain degree of minimalism and simplicity in their own cheerfully naive way, but this time they have exposed themselves as plainly insipid.
B00082IJ08|5.0|We all remember the Gorillaz first self-titled debut Album.  It was quirky, hip and a good listen.  Some songs were kinda weak though and I hear a lot about people pressing the skip button.  Personally, I was dissapointed with that album only b/c the other songs were so good that I couldn't see why the Gorillaz would shame themselves with the weaker songs like \\"Double Bass\\" and \\"M1-A1\\" <br /> <br />Enter \\"Demon Days\\". <br /> <br />Where \\"Gorillaz\\" seemed like one crazy quirky party, Demon Days is a somewhat solemn and introspective look at life.  In particular, at the Demon Days/Bad Days.  It's not so depressing that you can't bob your head to the poppy \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" but somber songs like \\"Kids with Guns\\", \\"Fire Coming out of a Monkey's Head\\" and \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\" make you really reavaluate things.   <br /> <br />No, Del the Funky Homo Sapien is no longer involved, but thats okay b/c Damion Albarn (who is the singing voice for 2-D) has compiled a multifarious cast of rappers, choirs and music mixers to fill the gap. <br /> <br />To be specific, the children's choir used in \\"Dirty Harry\\" really give it that extra push that makes it just right. <br /> <br />I've never heard ANYTHING like this before, so the uniqueness in itself is quite refreshing. <br /> <br />Also, quite possibly the best thing about this album is whereas \\"Gorillaz\\" was more of a \\"surface album\\" with little to no depth in the lyrics, \\"Demon Days\\" really makes you think.  Its full of metaphors and commentaries on society.  Some disturbing, others possibly fulfilling in some strange sense. <br /> <br />Do what I did and listen to the samples provided on this site.  They'll give a general feel of the album before you buy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|4.0|\\"Out of Exile\\" is certainly a crowning achievement for Chris Cornell and the existing members of Rage Against The Machine. Simply because we aren't hearing those two elements as separate colliding forces anymore. This is truly what Audioslave should sound like. They feel like a complete band now. Their debut was full of potential, but many critics including myself would agree, that it wasn't executed properly (although record sales wouldn't reflect that). When they recorded the first album, they had never played live, and subsequently joined forces in the studio. Well, now they returned to the studio to do it right after a long period of playing live concerts. It is still possible to pick out elements of Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden, but they actually pull off unification with the record nicely. You can tell that these guys really feel comfortable playing together, which was simply not the case with their debut. Here, we see Chris Cornell taking complete control of the lyrical direction (as it should be). It's simply amazing that Chris Cornell is still releasing material just as potent as his debut album with Soundgarden in 1988. And I feel that I can say without regret, that this is his best work since Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\" album from 1994. Tom Morello also adds to the album beautifully. His guitar work is among the most innovative in today's music, where Kim Thayil was more of a classicist guitar player (and one of the best). Morello simply keeps Chris Cornell's writing and delivery on the cutting edge. And I would have to say, that this is the best I've ever heard Morello play, seamlessly belting out solos in nearly every tune. Some people may think that solos are overdone, and aren't original in music anymore (Metallica). Well, I don't think that's true in the slightest, and especially with a guitarist like Morello. Since he's not a classicist guitarist, he experiments heavily on the guitar (more so than their debut). The guitar solos add heavily to the originality of the record. The chemistry between Cornell and Morello is simply phenomenal when comparing it to that of their first record.<br /><br />Overall, I'm truly happy that Audioslave has decided to return and get it right this time. Hell, they've already lasted longer than most super groups. \\"Out of Exile\\" is on par with Chris Cornell's legendary history, let alone one of the best albums of the year.ily to the originality of the record.

0440214041|5.0|This book is a non-stop, action-packed murder mystery filled with multiple layers of fascinating tangled political, business, and romantic intrigues. John Grisham is at his finest in creating a dynamic reading experience about highly attractive charasmatic people who stumble upon the truth ... during their hedonistic lifestyle in one of America's most colorful cities, New Orleans. Darby Shaw is a twenty-something law student at Tulane University in New Orleans when she learns of the murders of two Supreme Court Justices. One of the victims, Abraham Rosenberg, is the most admired and often quoted law scholar by Thomas Callahan, her constitutional law professor and ... also her lover. The speculation is that conservatives will be apppointed to replace the two Justices. The impact of these expected appointments on the future interpretation of the law will create thunderstorms in the Judicial system well into the future for at least 10 years ...<br /><br />Darby secluded herself for four days in a law library, digging through briefs, dissents, books, newspapers, essays, and law opinions ... trying to discover what the two murdered Justices had in common. By accident, she stumbles upon a subject of passionate interest to both: the environment. Her tenacity and persistence paid off, she wrote a paper on her discovery and speculated who had the most to gain by their elimination. She gave the paper to her law professor who shared the suppositions with lawyer friend from his law school days, who now works as an attorney for the F.B.I. The head of the F.B.I. discovered the suspect had donated money to the President's last re-election campaign, all of which was deemed legal. The accusations against the suspect were dismissed as mere speculation by the White House ... Yet, in some circles where the paper had circulated, the topic unleashed a wild tiger which hunted for its prey, in this case, Darby Shaw.<br /><br />One significant turning point in the book is when Thomas Callahan and Darby are out for dinner in the Big Easy. Thomas had too much to drink. Darby cautions him to let her drive, he denies his inebriated state. They have a big fight over this and she storms off, deciding to walk rather than ride with him. After Thomas turns the key in the ignition, a huge explosion occurs flipping the Porsche and knocking Darby face-down on the sidewalk. She arises from a daze ... nearly in shock. One must read the book to discover how she becomes a fugutive from a world famous assassin whom she manages to allude. After Thomas' death, she realizes *she* was the intended victim. This book is an un-put-downable, page-turning, suspense-filled murder mystery which is solved after Darby partners with a Washington Post reporter. Both of them help unravel the reasons for the two murders and help bring the perpetrator to justice. This is a superb novel.<br /><br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)an and Darby are out for dinner in the Big Easy. Thomas had too much to drink.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Back when I was a teenager, I would listen to stations like WAAF in Boston that played bands like Staind, Linkin Park, and System of a Down and based their image on being different than all that 'wussy pop music' you hear on other radio stations.  By listening to music that screams, pounds, and creens about how much mainstream society sucks, you became a nonconformist, one of the 'cool' people.  What they don't tell you is that Staind, Linkin Park, and System of a Down were all selling millions of records.  When I got tired of hearing just a bunch of screaming and pounding in everything I listened to, I took a step back and realized these bands were just as trite, predictable, and boring as the boy bands and teenage-girls-who-lipsync I detested so much. <br /> <br />System of a Down, being one of those trendy counter-cultural bands that you have to conform to in order to officially be a nonconformist, could have just yelled and pounded some more and sold millions more albums.  Instead, they made a refreshing decision to change their sound and move in a more creative direction.  In 'Mezmerize', the first half of a two disc set, the second of which will be released in the late fall, System of a Down takes the screaming and pounding that made them famous and adds a certain punk-esque melodic sensibility that lends their sound a whole new layer of depth, bringing them to a grand total of one layer of depth, and giving them a one-layer lead over all the other bands that get played on counter-cultural radio stations.  They've still got a few scream-your-head-off songs, such as the radio single 'B.Y.O.B.', but they're tempered by an unconventional, almost toungue-in-cheek appraoch to songwriting and a Sex Pistols-esque attitude that makes every song gripping and creates a unique feel that widens the scope of their sonic pallet farther than you might think is possible for metal. <br /> <br />A few of the less scream-your-head-off tracks sound almost like a punk band pickedup heavy metal instruments and started pounding on them.  'Lost In Hollywood', the highlight of the album, groans fatalistically about the amorality and facelessness of the process of fame.  Their lyrics are savagely countercultural, with lashes such as 'Why don't presidents fight the war/Why do they always send the poor'.  But unlike the forementioned class of countercultural music that includes Staind and Linkin Park, they manage to make it into a mood and atmosphere instead of just the self-pitiful whining vagueries you'd expect. <br /> <br />Mezmerize is an album that, unlike Staind's 'Break The Cycle' and Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory', it's fans might actually still care about ten years from now.
0393035158|5.0|How are we going to react when a nuclear explosion deletes one of our large modern population centers? How are we going to react when millions of \\"westerners\\" are annihilated at the hands of people who are simply following the guidance of a book that millions believe to be \\"the word of god\\"?  How are we going to respond to the collapse of the world economy when terror inflicts its ultimate goal (sending millions of infidels to hell)? <br /> <br />I for one believe that the above scenario is inevitable because we humans are stuck in a variety of belief systems that are counter productive to human cooperation and development. Mr. Harris in his rational discourse on religion and ancient tired dogmas should be a wake up call to all humans that we need to change our course. The End of Faith emphasizes that we all need to look deeply at our indoctrinated beliefs and \\"blind faiths\\" and begin to criticize this mind set.  As Mr. Harris states \\"time is not on our side\\". <br /> <br />Too many historical reviews of human behavior under the influence of religious indoctrination (and The End of Faith sites many) reveals some of the most irrational and horrifying behavior. Also, far too many current events have an underlying motivation that is religious belief based, including behavior of our own government. The End of Faith illustrates the fact that religion is the basis of much of modern conflict. If we are to improve our lot and move civilization forward, we need to heed Mr. Harris and seek an alternative moral methodology devoid of ancient scriptures. <br /> <br />The End of Faith is a must read for all inhabitants of this small planet. All humans must begin a dialog that criticizes our belief systems and opens our minds to create a new moral education and socialization infrastructure.  <br /> <br />How are we going to survive if we don't?

B00063F8B2|5.0|This will be a favorite CD for many years.  My 5 and 2 yr old sons love it. We listen to it all the time.  I keep it in the car and even burned them a copy for their playroom so they won't scratch the original.  They know all the words and ask to listen to it at least twice a week (and it is springtime!)  I find myself listening to it when driving alone.  It really puts you in a good mood.  We can't wait to buy the movie!
B00003CX5P|4.0|First I would like to say that Episode's I - III are PREQUELS to IV - VI.  I have read many reviews stating they are disappointed because there was no Darth Vader (James Earl Jones voice)  Attention:  There is no Darth Vader in Episodes I or II because he doesn't EXIST yet!<br /><br />Also I must get a few things off of my chest before I continue:  1.) Anakin is NOT Luke's son, and 2.) Obi Wan did not come back from the dead and ended up being young again having to train as a Jedi all over again.  3.) C-3PO was not \\"rebuilt\\" 4.) Anakin does NOT become the \\"new\\" Darth Vader.<br /><br />Again these are prequels, meaning they occur BEFORE A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />Storyline<br /><br />Obi Wan Kenobi and his Master Qui Jon Jinn are sent to settle a dispute with the Trade Federation.  They are attacked almost immediately but of course escape unharmed.  During the course of the movie these two Jedi cross paths with Queen Amidala who is being forced to sign a treaty that would certainly lead to war.  After Jinn and Kenobi rescue them and escape, their ship is damaged in the process.  They are forced to land on Tatooine to find supplies to repair their ship.  It is here that we meet Anakin Skywalker.  On the outside Anakin seems just like another little boy.  But Jinn sees and senses something in him that no one else has been able to see to this point except for his mother.  Jinn knows almost immediately that Anakin is indeed very special and could become a very powerful ally as a Jedi.  Young Anakin eventually decides to leave Tatooine with Jinn and Kenobi to start Jedi training.  The Jedi council is wary of having Anakin train as a Jedi because they sense that he could very dangerous.<br /><br />In order to prevent this review from being too long, I will leave the storyline at that, it can get very confusing and it jumps around quite a bit.<br /><br />To review the actual movie, I really enjoyed it.  Some scenes were better left out and one character in particular should have been left out completely, Jar Jar of course.  While he didn't annoy me quite as much as he did for others, I found him ruining this movie; especially how he accidentally killed those droids.  Had been less clumsy, and goofy, it would have been fine.  I could even put up with his strange voice had it not been for everything else.<br /><br />Jack Lloyd made a pretty good Anakin, I am glad Lucas choose a little known actor to play this role, mainly because anyone else who was more recognized would have caused viewed to associate that actor with other movies.  A perfect example of this is Mace Windu (played by Samuel MFing Jackson).  While I think Jackson did a great job playing his role, I just found it very hard to associate him with being a Jedi Master.  This is made even worse that he is the only Jedi I noticed that had a purple light saber, drawing even more attention to him.  The most convincing roles in the movie are Jinn and Kenobi.  Kenobi is an old favorite and I related to him almost immediately.  His master Jinn is also a character who is easy to relate to.  He is cool, calm and patient, all of which are traits Jedi's must possess.  He is not scared to do what he believes is right even going against the advice of Master Yoda, Master Windu and the rest of the Jedi Council.  At this point in his life, Obi-Wan is still quite young and does not yet posses the same degree of patience and confidence as his master.  However he does learn very quickly.<br /><br />There are only two Jedi duels in this movie (One and a half is more like it).  But the final duel is amazing.  Darth Maul's dual light saber has to be the coolest thing ever made.<br /><br />Though good prevailed in the end of this one, the movie ended in sort of a cliff hanger as Windu and Yoda were still trying to determine who the Sith Lord was.<br /><br />If you take the movie for what it is, then there really isn't more that can be expected from this movie.  While I can certainly accept people just not liking the movie, what I have a problem with, is people who rip this movie just because they don't understand it.  If you understand what is going on and you don't like the movie than that is fine.  You understand the movie enough to form an honest opinion about it.  Example, The previous review \\"Hank (The Hammer)\\" wrote an excellent review explaining why he didn't really like the movie.  He understands the story but just didn't like it.<br /><br />Others however write bad reviews just because they don't understand the story. Do not give this movie a bad review just because you don't get the plot or storyline, hoping that somehow characters that didn't even exist yet were in it, saying there were too much politics, or too many \\"new\\" characters.  If this is the case then you need to go back and re-watch it and understand it before reviewing it.<br /><br />The politics in this movie while a bit boring in some parts, really could not be avoided as it was necessary in order to show how the Empire and the Rebellion came to be.  I think Lucas did a brilliant job in telling this story, showing how things were before the Emperor took over, and also showing how Anakin Skywalker was discovered and that he wasn't always evil.ave a problem with, is people who rip this movie just because they don't understand it.

B00005JMUL|5.0|We took our 5yr old and 2yr old sons to see this.  They both loved it.  I was a little disappointed in some of the scenes although it did follow the book very closely with some Hollywood additions.  We loved the musical scenes.  Did not like the talking toys scene on the train.  A little scary for us and the children.  I did not think the Santa was very warm or jovial.  Would have liked him to be a little friendlier and jolly.  We have been fans of the book for a couple years and were so excited to see it made into a movie.  We are big Tom Hanks' fans and he did not disappoint.  We actually saw it twice at the kid's insistance that we take the grandparents. I actually enjoyed it better the second time! I saw a softer side to the Santa the second time around and the song between the little boy and girl on the train made me and my husband tear up.  We have since bought the CD and listen to it all the time.  The children love it.  My 2 yr old knows almost all the words.  Priceless to hear him sing, \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\".  I cry all over again.  We can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  We will be standing in line to buy it.  Going to have a big Polar Express movie night complete with Hot, Hot Chocolate!

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Matt Stone and Trey Parker are among some of the most clever and most savage satirists working today. Every week on their crudely animated TV show, South Park, they skewer sacred cows like religion, politics and dominant figures in popular culture. Their feature film debut, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, was a brilliant attack on rampant nationalism and the hypocrisy of the MPAA movie censors. Stone and Parker are back with another ingenious effort, Team America World Police, an action film done with puppets in the tradition of the classic Thunderbirds TV show.<br /><br />Like any good satire, Stone and Parker play it completely straight, never winking at the audience. Satire that works is almost always misinterpreted and rarely appreciated when it first comes out. Case in point: the South Park movie which wasn't the mega-blockbuster that the studio had hoped but has since developed a loyal cult following. I can see Team America heading the same way. One of the things that makes this movie so funny is that it goes after targets so in need of being satirized.<br /><br />The Unrated Version of this movie features a slightly longer, more disturbingly explicit puppet sex scene, which, not surprisingly, did not pass the MPAA censors.<br /><br />\\"Team America: An Introduction\\" has Parker and Stone introduce the members of the team. They mention that this movie was a conscious decision to take a giant step back, technology-wise, and a response to the excessive use of CGI in contemporary action movies.<br /><br />\\"Building the World\\" takes a look at the ambitious sets built for this movie. Production designer Jim Dultz had to recreate a believable Bruckheimer-esque world. The scale is truly impressive as is the amount of detail.<br /><br />\\"Crafting the Puppets\\" features puppet producer Edward Chiodo who talks about how he helped realize Matt and Trey's vision. We are taken through the design process (size, sculpting, etc.), how they are put together and so on.<br /><br />\\"Pulling the Strings\\" is a brief look at the art of puppeteering and how the film's puppeteers tried to achieve everything Matt and Trey wanted, including large scale action sequences with many puppets on camera at once.<br /><br />\\"Capturing the Action\\" takes a look at the film's director of photography, Bill Pope (who worked on The Matrix movies). He talks about applying normal action film camera moves to this movie and how he had to adjust said techniques for a smaller scale.<br /><br />\\"Miniature Pyrotechnics\\" shows how they pulled off some of the great looking explosions in camera and with no CGI.<br /><br />\\"Up Close with Kim Jong-Il\\" features Matt and Trey talking about why they cast the notorious North Korean dictator as the film's villain.

B00005JMXX|1.0|There is something positive about in this movie. It managed to start some public conversations about the greenhouse-effect at least somewhere in the globe but the enviromental message in \\"The Day After Tommorrow\\" got finally buried under its stupidness. No wonder, unfortunately. This is exactly something that could have been expected from the same director who has made such rubbish as \\"universal soldier\\" and \\"the Indepencence day\\". Unlike many other foreign directors Emmerich has found his way to stay in the big budget business by adding each time some korny and sentimental patriotism in his films, often directly out from the mouth of the president himself. There`s lots of holes in the script which can`t be filled not even by the massive special effects. Maybe I`m just too old( yet still a teenager) but I just can`t get excited by stuff like some crappy animated CGI-wolfs anymore. In this context, the first pictures of the gigantic wave where quite entertaining though.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I got the cd the day it came out. Audioslave has always been a great band and this cd shows it! Compared to their first cd, this one has deeper lyrics and overall just better music. The first album was amazing and i didn't think they could get any better but they did!!! Songs like Your time will come, Doesn't remind me and of course Be Yourself are great! You should definitly buy the album!
B0007DAZW8|1.0|The first time I played this album, I thought there was something wrong with my CD player.  Seriously.  Toward the end of track 2 I took the disc out and looked to make sure it wasn't scratched or damaged.  I just couldn't believe that someone listened to the track all the way through and at the end said \\"Yep, that's perfect!\\"  Uhhh, it's 3 minutes of a drum loop followed by 2 minutes of white noise guys. <br /> <br />I wouldn't even call it pretentious, because I don't feel like any real thought went into making this album.  It's annoying, it's WAY too repetitive (even for electronica), and it doesn't resemble either of their other two albums that I absolutely love. <br /> <br />The only track that's mildly interesting to me is \\"Technologic\\", and you don't have to buy the album to hear that.  Just wait for the iPod commercial to come on TV.  You can't miss it.  It's on about every 5 seconds.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The greatly organic produced new album from Miss Carey has become her comeback album undeniablely.  Since the leading single IT'S LIKE THAT started getting a great deal of airplay you knew Mariah was back on her game, although many pointed that Carey was a copycat of novelty acts such as Beyonce and others, Mariah has always been the leading lady in POP and R&B fusion, IT'S LIKE THAT is a pure party stomping dance track, carefree and ready to the clubs, WE BELONG TOGETHER the second single, is a average R&B tune, but with clever lyrics and heartbreakin' voice, SHAKE IT OFF, although is my less likeable track, is still okay, love the part HATE TO TOLD YOU SO, is been promoted a lot in Las Vegas, MINE AGAIN, one of the first retro soundin' song, strong voice!, SAY SOMETHIN, the chillin' out here song, really badd and outrageous, SNOPP shines, STAY THE NIGHT, one of my favorite so retro, so melancolic, so painful, extremely great, GET YOUR NUMBER, JD sounds like Nelly here, but stil I like the fast vocal part in the prechorus, amazing club joint, ONE AND ONLY, ok this is kind of Charmbracelet reminiscence...NOT THAT GREAT, but not thatbad, CIRCLES, retro sound and inspirational, YOUR GIRL, easy and great chorus, naughty thoughts into your mond, like the background, I WISH YOU KNEW, another retro...hate the live thing but I guess is different. TO THE FLOOR totally a neptunes rock track...easy, and everybody to the flo, JOY RIDE an amazing love song. FLY LIKE A BIRD...great closure, strong and definitely the return of the voice, as cheesy as it sounds, it's real...try it this is a great album.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I saw this film on theatrical release in and was very disappointed. Of course, alot of the disappointment initially had to do with the incredible hype build-up that accompanied the new trilogy. Nothing could have lived up to the public's expectations.  That having been said, The Phantom Menace is disappointing not so much because it stinks, but because, I felt, with some additional tweaking, it could have been much much better. Its almost as if Lucas got the plot ideas and character concepts developed to a schematic level and then sort of lost interest in them and did not develop them any further.  Specific gripes:   1. We never really bond with or understand Qui-Gon's character or his relationship with young Anakin. He states that he thinks Anakin may be the chosen one, but that is not really sufficient. We need to see an emotional bond or some kind of identification between the two, but it just isn't there.  2. Not to pick on Jake Lloyd (he's probably a great kid), but Lucas or whoever just did not get a good performance out of him. Plus, there is no hint in young Anakin at this point of character traits or flaws that might later foreshadow his fall. Yoda says he sees anger and fear in Anakin and the Jedi Council make vague predications that he may eventually be dangerous, but we as audience members just don't see it. We are supposed to infer that Anakin is somehow damaged by his life as as slave and subsequent separation from his mother, but again, we don't see any of this. His life as a slave doesn't seem to indicate any hardship; his big scene saying goodbye to his mom is not particularly moving (mainly due to wooden acting by Lloyd; Pernilla August as his mom does a good job thought). Also, if he's a slave, how does he have time/resources to build robots and pod racers? Just not very true to life.  Perhaps if we had seen Anakin and/or his mom subjected to some sort of abuse or exploitation we would have a better indication both of the fear and anger in Anakinand also a potential emotional reason for why Qui-Gon wants to rescue Anakin. When I reflected on it, I thought it would almost be better if Anakin were like the feral boy in Road Warrior II: an unkempt, unclean, and agressive character that had to be somewhat tamed and civilized by his Jedi rescuers. We don't see any character flaws, any little hints of selfishness, anger, fear or frustration. As is, young Anakin is just an average cute kid; we don't see any depth to why he wants to escape his life as a slave or run off to join the Jedi so we don't really care.  3. Source of humor: The original series had a mix of humor based upon the droids 3PO and R2D2 and also with the human characters (primarily interactions between Solo, Leia, and Luke). In TPM, the primary source of humor is generated from droids and Jar Jar Binks with little or no humorous banter or interaction between human characters. This has two effects: 1)relying on computer-generated characters for humor means the primary form of humor becomes physical slapstick, which is one of the main complaints about the Jar Jar charcter; and 2)the interactions between the human main characters, when deprived of humor, makes their relationships seem dry and mechanical, another source of the shallow characterizations.   The one humorous moment that stands out is when, after being ambushed by the Trade Feds at the beginning, Obi-Won says to Qui-Gon with a wry smile: \\"Well, you were right about one thing Master....the negotiations were short!\\" This one moment stands out because it is one of the few jokes between human characters and it works and expresses some of Obi-Won's personality. It also effectively echoes some of the banter and attitude that made Solo's character so liekable and crucial to the original films, an attitude and sensibility that is lacking in TPM. As is, we are stuck with Jar Jar's pratfalls for yuks, and it just doesn't work unless you are 5 years old.   4. The shallowness of Darth Maul: Similar to other problems with character depth, we don't know enough about Maul. He says early in the film that at last he will have revenge on the Jedi. Revenge for what? We never know beyond vague notions that the Sith and Jedi are ancient enemies. That is not enough. We either need to be shown more back story on this or have some reason for Maul's motivation. His fight scenes with the Jedi at the end are dynamite and clearly the actor is very skilled in martial arts and projects a menacing attitude with only minimal dialog or screen time, but we never really know anything about him other than \\"he is a bad guy\\" and that is not enough.  5. Plot goofiness. As others have pointed out, all the midi-chlorian business is a red herring of mumbo-jumbo that takes the mystical mystery out of the Force and reduces it to a medical condition. The Jedi are supposed to be wise, powerful seers, but them seem oblivious to the presence and intentions of the bad guys over and over again. Having young Anakin build C3PO is silly and seems like a forced \\"circle closer\\". Further, having Anakin start out on Tatooine doesn't seem right and seems like another circle closer that is forced. Wouldn't he remember all this years later as Darth Vader in Episode 4? Wouldn't there be some result of this coincidence? As noted above, having a slave that doesn't seem to be deprived or suffering and has the time/resources to build robots and pod racers as a hobby seems goofy too.  Again, it seemed to me like Lucas got the plot and characters to a certain point and then quit on them. With only a little extra effort or different emphasis on certain elements, the movie could have been much improved and the audience would have had more insight into the characters and identified with them more. As is, the lack of character development combined with wooden acting makes it hard for the audience to care. The special effects set pieces are spectacular, and the computer generated elements are pioneering and well executed, but without a reason to care about or like the characters, its hard to get too excited.  Again, not a horrid movie, but frustrating because with just a few changes or extra effort, it could have been so much better.  POSTSCRIPT (2011)to my original year 2005 review:   This movie does not get better with time or repeated viewings. Further, the contention of some fans who like this movie and claim it should be viewed in the context of the other films (now complete) is not only a misguided apologist stance, but outright doesn't hold water. Why? Because if you compare TPM to any of the 5 other SW films, it is clearly the idiot bastard son of the bunch, wheezing and drooling in the corner.   In review, I give credence to a theory that a lot of other reviewers have given: in essence, Lucas was boiling everything down in this film to aim at the 5-year-old to 8-year-old demographic (probably to sell toys and mechandise, the real unexpected treasure that the original trilogy coughed up back in the 70's and 80's) and, as a result, bored everyone else to tears and/or made older fans hopping mad. However, huge stretches of this movie are so slow-moving that I bet a lot of the the target audience squirmed around in their seats anyway.  The second theory that other viewers have posed that seems to ring true with me as well is that Lucas is in a position now where he's THE MAN and, as a result, has no one around him that is willing to bring up constructive criticism to him or challenge weaknesses in the plot, script, or characters. Back in the day, while the original SW was certainly his vision, that film had to rely on a far more collaborative process to get made and address the many challenges its making entailed. With TPM, Lucas had total personal control and it seems like no one around Lucas had the guts to say: \\"George, we need a good kid actor to play a central character like Anakin, not some cutesy wooden mop-topped kid from TV commericals\\" or \\"Damn, George, that Jar Jaris irritating as hell!\\" or \\"George, did you realize all the aliens seem to be stand-ins for offensive real-life planet Earth racial / cultural stereotypes?\\" or \\"All the scenes with Kabuki-Natalie are boring boring boring\\" or \\"This movie is all-CGI and no plot and no character depth!\\" or \\"This movie is full of jumbled-up crap that makes no sense!\\". Further, modern movie technology further consolidated control with Lucas in that the 1970's technology required many people's input to solve technical problems and was far less malleable; modern CGI allows Lucas to personally review, tweak, and endlessly revise every aspect of the film just the way he wants it.  In a nutshell, there is a reason that the Irvin Kerschner (R.I.P.)- directed \\"Empire\\" is widely viewed as the best of the 6 films. How Lucas could see dailies of some of the performances he got out of his actors in TPM and not realize things stank or, at the very least, weren't working is beyond me, unless he was constantly surrounded by lackeys and toadies saying \\"That's great, Mr. Lucas! Not explaining anything about Darth Maul makes him sooooo mysterious! Having Jar Jar be a moron who speaks like Stepin Fetchit is really cool! He needs more screen time! You're a genius!\\". In retrospect, I wish that Lucas had handed over all the remaining films from \\"Return\\" all the way thru the newer Pre-Quel trilogy to others with Lucas only having an overall story arc / consulting role.   I know that Lucas is irritated by fans who act as if he \\"owes them\\" to handle all these movies a certain way (its HIS vision, as I'm sure he'd point out), and maybe it is unfair to whine about how Lucas could have / should have directed the story a different way. But the fact is that TPM is not a very good movie, and regardless of quibbles about overall direction of the story line, Lucas did owe it to fans to at least not make a stinker-roo that not only insults fans above the age of 8, but really tarnishes the legacy from the first trilogy.Lucas seems to think these movies are only for kids now, and has, at least in the case of TPM, clearly targeted them accordingly.   However, while I guess one could argue that adults should only go to see films like \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" or the oevre of Ingmar Bergman and leave anything less mature and intellectual to the kiddies, the fact is millions and millions of adults went to and enjoyed the first trilogy (and other action-adventure-fantasy films) and it is not unrealistic to expect millions of adults would have some interest in the Pre-Quel trilogy as well. Further, it is not unreasonable to expect those adults would have some expectation that the Pre-Quel trilogy would not only have something worthwhile for grown ups, but would also build and expand upon, in a worthy way, the original trilogy that was so well-liked. Lucas, frankly, dropped the ball on this one; contentions that it should be enough simply because it sprang out of Lucas' mind and vision are not sufficient.   One could even argue that Lucas now has more contempt than anything else for his adult audience and for the fanboys who gripe about things like \\"How could he make Greedo shoot first?\\" (the big Special Edition tweak that many felt was a poke in the eye.) Lucas seems to go thru great lengths to tweak things that don't need it and then ignores or is oblivious to things that are huge, infected carbuncles staring him right in the face, like crappy dialog, unrealistic plot devices, bad casting, and wooden acting. Its almost as if with TPM he's saying \\"Grow up, already! Trix are for kids! Don't forget to buy your kid a Happy Meal with an authorized LucasFilm toy on the way home!\\"   In short, Lucas seems to be taking his own films far less seriously than his fan base (and probably movie goers in general) does, and it clearly irritates the crap out of him (and/or he doesn't understand it). However, it also irritates the crap out of his fans and the audiences who loved the movies of the original Trilogy and expected more of the TPM. At worst, as some other harsh reviews have pointed out, TPM seems like just another cynical Hollywood-as-usual souless big money cash-in; was it so wrong for fans to expect something more than that? Until TPM, everyone felt that the Star Wars series was somehow different from the myriad of sci-fi / fantasy effects-laden movies (many of them awful; others: naked cash grabs) that its success inspired and spurred from 1977 onwards. The Star Wars series seemed to have a spirit of its own. The reason, whether Lucas understands it or not, for the vitirol spewed about TPM is many fans felt this \\"special-ness\\" was betrayed or sold short (either out of laziness, sloppiness, ineptitude, or worse, greed).   In short, TPM is a stinker. I surmise that even though he seemed to discount it in the press, Lucas took some of the fan reaction to TPM to heart as he stepped his game up somewhat with (the marginally better) AOTC and certainly with the much better (and darker, natch) ROTS. (Granted, no one is going to think ROTS was directed by Kubrick, but you get my point). Too bad TPM seems, still, like a serious and uncertain mis-step, almost like a rough draft concept that should have been abandoned and re-done from scratch. \\"Super Special Edition\\" anyone?
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Poorly made horror film that has Keanu Reeves in his worse performance in quite sometime fighting the forces of evil in order to save the world from the coming apocalypse. Keanu is a decent actor but he's miscast in the role of John Constantine and his performance is so uninspiring that it could put you a sleep if you are not careful.  The story is a real bore and manages to go against what it sets up earlier in the film in the last twenty minutes in order for Keanu to have a gun fight with the bad guys and the plot twist in the end makes absolutely no sense at all because the movie does not establish the reason why a certain character does what she does.  A lot of praise has been giving to Rachel Weisz for being the only good thing this film has and she does deserve that praise because her performance does make this film better than it really is. Too bad for her and all of us that the movie just does not live up to her performance and we have to suffer with a film that is more in tune with Keanu's bad acting than the graceful and professional performance by Rachel Weisz that the movie should have been more in tune with.
0393038912|5.0|The western colonising pioneers have left a legacy of racial bias to their descendants. Wherever white folk have taken civilisation to the savage native populations the indigenous peoples have suffered destruction of their own cultures (which were invisible to the colonizers or regarded as proof of the natives' savagery)and racial vilification. The superiority of western culture, as perceived by Europeans, has been taken as proof of the superiority of Europeans themselves and the inferiority of the colonised peoples. Surely, the arguement goes, if they had been as intelligent, hard-working, creative or favored by God as the Europeans, they would have developed advanced cultures as the Europeans have done. <br />Diamond's book is a brilliant riposte to that racist arguement. He shows how domesticatible plants and animals were the key factor in the development of farming allowing the abandonment of a hunter and gatherer existence. He shows that the so-called inferior cultures lacked those resources. He shows that the development of farming allowed specialisation in production, the development of an army and resistence to disease through close contact with farm animals which are the ultimate source of most human infections. He shows that colonising forces were able to subdue indigenous populations by infecting them and carving them up with their superior weapons. <br />Once again science demonstrates the folly of racial supremacy theory. Good on you, Jared!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Jack Nicholson portrayed 63 year-old Harry Sanborn, owner of a rap record company, who only dates younger women (yes, fiction can mirror the truth).  Diane Keaton portrayed Erica Barry, a famous playwright who has been divorced for a few years and never thought she would be involved with another man again.<br /><br />Sanborn is dating much younger Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), Erica's daughter, and the two opt for two days of nooky at her mother's house in The Hamptons.  When Erica and her other daughter stumble upon Sanborn in his boxers raiding the fridge, they're surprised to learn that this much older guy is Marin's boyfriend.  Thus begins the adventure.<br /><br />After Harry and Marin go into the bedroom for a little fun, Harry suffers a heart attack.  He's ordered to take it easy for a while and his doctor, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) orders him to stay in the vicinity of the hospital in order to keep tabs on him.  Erica's house just so happens to be in the vicinity.<br /><br />While Marin enjoys the nightlife, Harry recoups at her mother's house and, while sitting around, has nothing better to do than strike up conversation with Erica.  They discover they are curious to know more about the other but just won't admit to it.  The daughter sees the chemistry and gets out of the way (although she realizes that Harry broke up with her and not the other way around).<br /><br />In the meantime, much younger Dr. Mercer takes an interest in Erica and she goes from a lonely divorcee to an older woman in the middle of two mens' affection (and I think Reeves was charming in his role).<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I was thrown for a loop when it seemed that Harry and Erica were getting along great and then, boom, she's all of a sudden pissed at him because she sees him in a restaurant with another woman (whom he, typically, refers to as a \\"friend\\").<br /><br />He admits that he's not a good \\"boyfriend\\" and Erica is devastated.  She channels her hurt by sobbing uncontrollably and completing her autobiographical play, basing it on her experiences with Harry - which he doesn't find out about until a (young) actress he's wining and dining explains the premise.  Feeling insulted, he confronts Erica, explaining that \\"...schmucks are people, too\\" and she wants to go forward as friends.<br /><br />Fast forward: Harry retires to the Caribbean for a whole 2 weeks and seeks out his former girlfriends who inform him what kind of a jerk he's been to them.  He travels the farthest to Paris to see Erica (remembering her favorite resturant there) and just when you think they might end up together, in comes Dr. Mercer who proposes.  Erica accepts and one thinks that they may end up together and leave Harry in the cold.  Not so.<br /><br />How Dr. Mercer got out of the way was a little too easy (more conflict?) but Harry and Erica wound up together (and married) after all.<br /><br />And Diane Keaton parle français tr&egrave;s bien (and from what I could hear on my TV, Jack ain't too shabby himself).<br /><br />Refreshing premise that proves women aren't obliged to sit at home and roll up into a ball for the remainder of eternity just because they're over 25.l play, basing it on her experiences with Harry - which he doesn't find out about until a (young) actress he's wining and dining explains the premise.

B000063CPL|5.0|Wow.  Imagine being part of the crowd during Iron Maiden's stop to Rio de Janerio for their Brave New World tour.  Just think being part of 250,000 screaming brazilians who know every word to every song that Iron Maiden perform.  Also imagine Iron Maiden's best live album released since Live After Death.  Finally, imagine Bruce Dickinson, the voice of Iron Maiden, back with the band to stay!<br /><br />Maiden get things going with a bang with the opener, The Wickerman.  They continue on with Ghost of the Navigator and Brave New World.  The song 2 Minutes to Midnight is breathtaking, along with the song, Blood Brothers.  Two of my favorite tracks come from...yes...songs from the two Blaze albums he did with Iron Maiden - The Sign of the Cross and The Clansman.  Even though Bruce did not write the material, he performs them with so much emotion and passion.  The Evil that Men Do and Fear of the Dark sound equally good.  The songs Number of the Beast, Hallowed be thy Name, and Run to the Hills caps off a brilliant live show.<br /><br />Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time.  This live album is just as good as Live After Death and a great compliment to anyone's metal collection.  Maiden continues to make incredible music with their Dance of Death release last year.  I was able to see them perform in Los Angeles, CA for their American leg of that tour.  It was a beautiful experience.  Please buy this album, along with Live After Death!!  These are ESSENTIAL to own for Maiden fans! This is NOT to be missed!  Purchase the live DVD!!
B00005J6T1|5.0|I'm \\"old\\" enough to remember the Madonna craze that swept the nation in the early and mid-1980's: It seemed as though every adolescent kid (me) and teenaged girl wanted to copy her look with the tons of jewelry, the calf-length pants, the sky-high hair, the pounds of makeup, and the punk clothes.  Of course, those of us still in the single digits of age would have gotten our hides kicked if we walked around in that much makeup, so we settled for listening to her album (back when it was actually an album!).<br /><br />I enjoy listening to Madonna's first self-titled album time and again because of the fact that, indeed, they're songs that can still be (and are) enjoyed to this day - 22 years later.<br /><br />\\"Burning Up\\" is special for us Madonna fans as this was her first video.  The song sounds dated (those 80's synthesizers at work!) but you can always ignore that and just enjoy the beat.<br /><br />\\"Holiday\\" has become a classic party tune and whenever I hear \\"Borderline\\" I think of the video where she's playing a wanna-be model spray-painting on the wall and how the paint winds up on the photographer's car (who happens to have taken a romatic interest in her) and the look that says she just doesn't care.<br /><br />People can say whatever they want about Madonna but the woman has proven she can change according to the times and still match and/or outsell kids half her age.<br /><br />You can either like her or hate her, but there's definitely no in between.  And, either way, she laughs all the way to the bank.
1400079179|3.0|With \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" Dan Brown has achieved the dream of all writers, he has achieved tremendous success and immortality. It won't matter if his next book is a dud, it will make number one in the New York Times. The struggle is over.<br /><br />As for why the book if so popular when there is nothing original about it or actually disclose anything we have not heard, read or seen in movies thousands of times?. I think I know the answer, CONTROVERSY; let's be real, this was not a cultural phenomenon in the world till it became famous in America. And the only reason it did is because Americans love controversy, they thrive on it!.<br /><br />There are hundreds of books and movies (The last temptation of Christ, anyone?) that suggest that Mary Magdalene and you know who were having fun. But nobody ripped their clothes in outrage till now? Why? I know the answer again OPORTUNISM; this is the time to be noted and raise hell.<br /><br />Anyway, all that probably will pass soon, if you must read DVC go ahead, it's actually a pretty fast and entertaining read, but do not allow it to change your perception of reality, you know better than that! Remember FICTION.
B00005J6T0|5.0|Of all Madonna's albums, \\"True Blue\\" remains the most underrated.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm happy to see it get such high marks here.<br /><br />\\"True Blue\\" proved that Madonna could change her look and sound to keep things interesting.  It also proved her songwriting could take curves if she wanted it to.<br /><br />Even though she didn't write \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (except to add \\"additional lyrics\\" to it), I'll always remember the video to it (especially that great shirt proclaiming, \\"Italians Do It Better\\") as well as to \\"Open Your Heart\\" - where she played one of those women in peep shows.  \\"La Isla Bonita\\" also stands out because of the video in which she dances in beautiful Spanish costume in the barrio and prays at a makeshift altar.<br /><br />But my favorite track here is \\"Live To Tell,\\" which was a cut written for her then-husband Sean Penn's movie, \\"At Close Range\\" (which was good).  Almost 20 years later and you can still feel that foreboding in her voice that if that secret is let out, she's doomed.  Besides, the melody rocks.<br /><br />Her tribute to James Cagney (\\"White Heat\\") was catchy and \\"Where's the Party?\\" has become quite a party favorite (wonder why).<br /><br />Solid Madonna album and a must-have (to put it mildly).
B00082IJ08|5.0|I recently bought the new Gorillaz album, Demon Days, which I have been anticipating for quite sometime now ever since I caught a glimpse at their music video for the single `Feel Good inc.' I must admit I was immediately captivated  by the intensely original and slightly off illustrations and graphics of Jamie Hewlett while their just as intensely original and experimental sound left be some what bewildered. Their music I admit does take a bit of acquiring when first listened to. With such a variety of integrated beats and instrumentals and not to mention the ghostly vocals of front man, Damon Albern [aka 2D; the animated lead vocalist of the group] it is not surprising to me that it takes more than one time for the ears to take in the full impact of their music. The `Project, Gorillaz' has proven to be a revolutionary movement in music itself, melding together the collaborations of many different artists and styles with the politically and environmentally aware lyrics to back it up. With an immensely urban vibe coursing through the newly released album, smooth vocals, intriguing lyrics and the equally intriguing animated group members, this is definitely one album that you don't want to overlook in the music section. <br /> <br />
B000002L6P|4.0|After the success of her first album, Madonna went commercial with \\"Like A Virgin,\\" creating a video for \\"Material Girl\\" that was a direct copy of a scene in \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" starring Marilyn Monroe (and a tag that has branded her to this day when the media refer to her) and the unforgettable video of her dancing on a gondola in Venice, Italy and being seduced by a tiger/man for the title track.<br /><br />I tend to gravitate more towards the lesser known tunes such as \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (which didn't get a whole lot of airplay back in the day, at least in my city, but now gets played pretty frequently), \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo,\\" and \\"Pretender.\\"<br /><br />Some songs show their age but, in all, \\"Like A Virgin\\" is essential Madonna as it showed her growth as a songwriter (and her ability to sing other folks' compositions) as well as appeal to a wide range of people (whereas she was mainly targeted towards a dance audience).<br /><br />Classic 80's stuff.
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway is an excellent story of trials, courage, love and sacrifice. In this book, Hemingway tells the story of a young American professor of Spanish while he works as a dynamiter in the Spanish Civil War. His mission: to cover the attack of the Army of the Republic on a pass in the mountains by blowing up a bridge to prevent reinforcements from arriving at the front. Through the course of his mission, he will experience a roller coster ride of emotion, from the heights of love to the depth of sorrow. In this book, Hemingway gives us excellently developed and rounded characters. Their histories are bared to us, as they tell of the horror that is civil war. For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book for any high schooler wishing for an amazing book, or for any adult who wishes to have an extremely well written book to read.
B000002LGQ|5.0|I originally bought this on cassette back when it was first released in 1989 and remember the furor over the video to \\"Like A Prayer\\" with the burning crosses and Pepsi cancelling their contract with her because of all the negative publicity.<br /><br />The censorship hasn't let up since.<br /><br />Madonna showed, once again, that she wasn't afraid to cross boundaries and use a taboo subject - religion - to sell her music.  In 1989, she was Roman Catholic and shrugged off the comments about what a lousy Catholic she really was (she's so lousy that even though she converted to another religion when she had her children, she chose to name them after two Catholic saints - Our Lady of Lourdes and San Rocco).<br /><br />This is Madonna's most polished work of the 80's - and possibly of her career.  She proved that she could be pop but included serious messages in her music, such as with \\"Oh Father\\" (having to deal with abusive men in her life) and \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" about, again, being in an abusive relationship.  \\"Promise To Try\\" has a beautiful melody but with super sad lyrics.<br /><br />I do enjoy \\"Love Song.\\"  I didn't think Madonna and Prince would make a good songwriting team but, boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />You can't be a Madonna fan and not have this in your collection.
0345440900|5.0|I read this book to help me solve sleeping problems with the 4 month old I am nannying (as recommended by mom).  It is easier to read than most parenting books and gives good practical advise.  For example, she advises to put baby down before he's asleep but pick him up if he cries and comfort him until he stops and then put him back down - repeat until baby is able to calm himself to sleep.  I was worried that picking him up would establish a bad habit, but I found out that after a while, he didn't need me to pick him up anymore.  She mentions that on one occassion while teaching a baby to calm himself, she picked-up/put-down the baby over 100 times one night before the baby went to sleep.  That's a little frightening, but it's those details - the range of normalcy - that most advise books leave out!  Without that information you may get to pick-up # 30 and think, \\"My baby is different.  Surely the author would agree that this just isn't working\\" and quit.  But the example gives you confidence that although it may be tough at first, if you just persevere, it will get better and your life will be easier - and the baby happier.  <br /> <br />I thought the advise about talking to your baby (giving it a tour of the house, explaining every touch and diaper change) was a little out-there, but I tried it and found that the baby responded much better and seemed to even understand.  She also discusses that most babies' crying will escalate 3 times when putting them to sleep.  That was helpful because I could count them in my head and know that after about the 2nd or 3rd, it would end!   <br /> <br />The Baby Whisperer approach is neither too child-centered (attachment parenting) or too parent-centered (or rigid scheduling).  It doesn't tell you to control the baby, but it also points out how teaching the baby independence is good for  and respectful of him.  It was extremely helpful to read a book that told me, \\"Do this and it will get better if you follow through.\\"  And itdid!  It wasn't more than a few days after applying the advise that I was able to get the baby to sleep without a fight.  Now he's practically eliminated the whole 10-minute routine I did before naptime and will reach for his crib, find his passy and go to sleep by himself (sometimes with a little crying).  I understand more when he's telling me he's ready for a nap and I find it's a fairly predictable schedule, although not rigid.   <br /> <br />The explanation of 5 typical baby personalities is helpful, yet flexible.  My baby didn't fit into one category, but I understood him better.  May especially be helpful for parents with a \\"grumpy\\" baby to know that it's nothing you're doing or not doing (although it might be if the baby's not on a flexible schedule).  Often it's just a disposition the baby has.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I've also read Gary Ezzo's book and prefered this, even though most of my friends follow Baby Wise.  I recommended this to my sister-in-law who was having trouble with her newborn's sleeping habits and it helped her tremendously also.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Have you ever finished a movie feeling such immense affection for its characters you wondered what happened to them after the film ended, and hated that you'd never know? How rare it is to get the answer to that question in a worthy sequel. Before Sunset is that rare movie.    In the first film, Before Sunrise, in 1995 two early twenty-somethings, an American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and a French girl named Celene (Julie Delpy) met on a train through Europe. After spending the day and night and into the next day walking and talking around Vienna, they were firmly in love, and as they parted at the train station promised to meet on that same spot, at 6 PM, exactly six months later. There the movie ended. As is pointed out in Before Sunset, different people react differently to the previous movie's ambiguous ending. Did the two young lovers make that appointment? Did they meet again, did they live happily ever after? Depending on your personality, some will say no, some yes, some can't decide.    In the sequel, Before Sunset, we learn the answer: they did not. It's nine years later, 2004, and Jesse has written a bestseller about that one night, that special girl he never saw again. Then, in Paris on the last stop of a whirlwind promotional tour, he looks up and there she is. Celene, the girl who got away. Thus the two embark on another walking, talking marathon, in a different year, through a different city. But this time the stakes are higher. In the first movie they had most of a day to fall in love; and they were young, they didn't really understand what they had. After all, if this one love slipped away, surely there would be another, just as good, along shortly. Now in their thirties, they both suspect the sort of love they felt comes, if you're extremely lucky, once in a lifetime. Now they have only hours before Jesse's plane leaves to take him back to the US. (Apparently in Before Sunset-land simply taking a later flight is not an option. So in that sensethe \\"time limit,\\" as in the first movie, is a bit artificial.) In that time they have to determine if fate dealt them a horrible misdeed, if they truly were robbed of their soulmate, if they're still in love, if they have a place in each others lives. And if this is true love, as rare as it is to find that in life, how much rarer to be given a second chance. Should they go for it or walk away, knowing there won't be a third chance?    This is not a simple question. Jesse is trapped in a loveless marriage but has a four-year old son he adores. Leaving his wife to be with Celene would also mean leaving his son. Celene's had a series of horrible relationships leaving her almost incapable of daring to believe she could ever be truly happy, ever believe in love again. This is a woman with more than a few emotional dings. (Or is it that Jesse's primary problem with his wife is that she's not Celene? Is Celene's problem with any other man that he's not Jesse?)    It's fascinating to note how from movie to movie the two characters' personalities have interchanged. In Before Sunrise, Jesse was the complete cynic, constantly questioning and popping Celene's starry-eyed, trusting worldview. Nine years later, the loss of each other has worked profound alterations in them both. Jesse's felt the lack of love in his life but it hasn't made him bitter, he's come to the conclusion the world just might be a pretty good place, he's much more ready to believe in true love. In the interim, Celene's become so afraid of being hurt in love she describes her current boyfriend's major positive trait as being that he's almost never there. The cynic has become the romantic and vice-versa.     I might as well mention the one thing I did not love about this movie. Early on, there's a scene in which Celene voices a long litany of ultra-liberal, anti-industry, anti-gun, anti-good ol' US of A sentiments, among them calling the US an \\"imperialist country\\" and saying the only reason to be proud of being an American is the sexual staying power of its men. (Okay, I kind of liked that part, but it's certainly not the ONLY reason to be proud.) The fact that the expression on Jesse's face during Celene's angry, hate-filled rant shows he finds her performance charming had me doubting both characters' sanity. That scene really left a bad taste in my mouth. It was going to take an absolutely killer movie from that point on - great acting, dialogue, direction - to win me back over to its side. Fortunately, as my 5 star rating for the film shows, Before Sunset has all that stuff. By the end of the movie, I was just loving it, caring about Jesse and, yes, Celene as well.    The idea for a sequel to Before Sunrise was hatched in the minds of director Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (all of whom contributed to the sequel's script) before the first movie was even complete. Because they wondered the same things as other people: did Jesse and Celene ever meet again? Did they live happily ever after? In Before Sunset, the question is: how to end the movie? Shall we make a statement about the possibility of finding true love, or the nobility of self-sacrifice and facing up to reality at all costs? Romantic or realist? You can make a serious case for both. Some people find the ending of Before Sunset, like the ending of Before Sunrise, ambiguous. I don't. The answer is clear to me. After the final fade-out, I whispered to myself: \\"Perfect. Just....perfect.\\"
B00097DX3U|2.0|i still CRANK all of soundgarden and rage's music -- i read somewhere that morella says he didn't come to the show with big riffs -- damn shame -- 'cause it shows.  as for cornell, though a good voice, he wants to be in the same league as mariah carey -- damn shame.  as for the lyrics -- same old same old -- he needs some new metaphors -- perhaps a few literature courses or the \\"poetic principle\\" -- all in all, damn shame. <br /> <br />they need to 'feel' the rage again and live like animals.....they're gone...:(
B0007OASII|5.0|While this may not be the most progressive of metal albums around, it is certainly Kamelot at their artistic apex, musically and lyrically. Their music has transcended from power metal into the realm of progressive music with each consecutive album, especially with their previous album Epica, though even that was quite filled with power metal songwriting structures. The release of Black Halo sees Kamelot driving their music even further into the progressive music while still having somewhat of a link to their well-written power metal influence (unlike their following flop of an album, Ghost Opera), if not being even heavier. The lyrical concept album sequel to Epica, each song from the start of the album to finish is incredible, stunningly composed and orchestrated, especially March of Mephisto and The Haunting. I think This Pain is probably the only slightly mediocre song on the whole album. Even the storyline of the album is well produced and executed, the lyrical content being almost flawless in itself. And like many progressive albums it takes a few listens to appreciate it's genius (with there being some actual genius to appreciate). This may be only arguably a progressive masterpiece, but it is without doubt a metal masterpiece in the genre of progressive music.<br /><br />While this may not be the most progressive of metal albums around, it is certainly Kamelot at their artistic apex, musically and lyrically.

B0007WZUMY|3.0|If your looking for more of the same from the first cd you will be sadly disappointed..this album is softer and the lyrical content written by cornell is shakey..how could his fellow band mates let him record such trivial lyrics like \\"dosen't remind me\\"...don't get me wrong i love audioslave and their first album is in my top three of all time but this cd lacks depth..there are some decent songs such as \\"the worm\\" but overall this album falls short of audioslaves potential..album three will be the true test...
B00082IJ08|5.0|Holy ... don't think i can say that on the internet this album totally rocks! With amazing colaborations from de la soul, dennis hopper and some weird london choirs, this album is truly so much better than G-SIDES and GORILLAZ. Tracks worth looking out for are dirty harry, obviously named after their hit single clint eastwood, giving off a kind of bubbly music sense to it, but a pretty weird message. White light, no doubt about DRUGS! goes on for about two minutes, but has a WICKED base line and beat to it. Undoubtedly the best track is fire coming out of the monkey's head, and i think it's one of the best songs i have ever heard. Basically, the whole song is about the \\"happy folk\\" and how they begin to get greedy, but just close your eyes while listening to Dennis Hopper's amazingly freaky narration and you just get this totally awesome picture in you head. <br /> <br />So all in all? A friggin' amazing album, somewhere up there with the best track from GORILLAZ m1a1. <br /> <br />ABSOLUTELY DAMN WICKED!!! Totally five stars!!!
B000002UEB|5.0|the operation mindcrime album is amazing. it tells the story of a man who gets caught up in a sect where he gets orders to assassinate certain high ranking government members from the mysterious leader. he falls in love with a nun who helps him out who used to be a hooker. the songs are classic \\"spreading the disease \\"probablly being the best one. geoff tate is a real character and theres a rumor of part two coming out. this album rules and is eerie in its story telling.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Cornell sounds like he is more at the helm of this project than the last one.  I don't find him screaming as much either, but that's a good thing cause he can sing &quot;mary had a little lamb&quot; and make it sound like the next best thing.<br />&quot;Your time has come&quot; sounds like an extension of Cochise, but chugs along like a steamroller.  Fave's right now would be &quot;Out of Exile&quot;, Heaven's Dead&quot;, &quot;The Worm&quot;, and 'Drown me Slowly&quot;.  The latter sounding like total Superunkown Soundgarden era.<br />Production is always top notch with Rick Rubin.  Everything cranked up to ten but also in the right places.<br />Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.  It does take a couple of listens but I can't take it out of my cd player now.
1594200106|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book tremendously.  Such a tale of intrigue.  Anyone who's ever been to Barcelona and walked the streets should read this book.  A fabulous read that could not be put down.  I read it in Spanish first and have since bought the book in English to reread it.<br /><br />Excelente
B0000UHFC6|5.0|When I was watching the movies, I would hum along with the music.  I finally bought the soundtrack, and I absolutely love it.  It completely captures Middle Earth, and it's cultures and themes.  I never really liked classical music or that sort of thing, but I can not stop listening to the Lord of the Rings Soundtracks.  The Return of the King is my favorite.  My favorite tracks are 2- Hope and Memory, 8- Twilight and Shadow(the elvish music is so relaxing and comforting!), 17- The Return of the King, and 19- Into the West.  I really shouldn't say I have a favorite because all of the tracks are so SPECTACULAR.  This album didn't win an Oscar for nothing, it truly is the best.
076790592X|4.0|A story of Morrie Schwartz's life and his passing of the torch to Mitch, with the hope that the lessons he's learned can be used by Mitch.<br /><br />It's very inspirational and the lessons that Morrie gives us are applicable to every one of us uniquely.  The insights that Morrie offers through Mitch are especially valuable to younger readers who have yet to test out and find their own way and purpose in life, as Morrie makes a strong case that happiness lies in having the ability to live life your way.<br /><br />It's an easy book to finish, as I had it read in less than 3 hours, but you might say it's short and sweet.  VERY sweet, actually....so much so that I felt a little nauseaus!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Don't buy this, this is not the original trilogy. Hated it.
B000001EAQ|2.0|U2 pulled off an amazing feat with 1991's ACHTUNG BABY and 1993's ZOOROPA: both were successful departures from their classic sound and completely redefined the band. With 1997's POP, they tried another direction, but this time it doesn't work. Bono claims they failed because they let their management take control, setting a tour schedule before the album was complete, and as a result, the band were pressured to finish POP on time, but it's doubtful more time would've saved this album. <br /> <br />The songs aren't that good. \\"If God Will Send His Angels,\\" \\"Last Night On Earth,\\" \\"Gone,\\" \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress,\\" and \\"Please\\" all have something to like about them, but they never take off and aren't that memorable. Only \\"Mofo\\" and \\"Staring At The Sun\\" really hold-up. <br /> <br />U2 should be commended for trying something new, hiring some excellent DJ's to mix and produce their music, but they don't have a good grasp on contemporary dance trends. \\"Discotheque\\" was the big, lead-off single, and it's not a bad track, but it feels too forced and a little awkward. \\"Mofo\\" is the only successful dance track, with a muscular production that crushes \\"Discotheque,\\" and unlike the other dance-oriented tracks, it flows pretty naturally.  <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, this album is one of their least popular ones. When they released BEST OF: 1990-2000, they tried remixing a few songs, removing most of the production, but they only made the songs worse, exposing the weaknesses more and removing the very thing that made these songs interesting (not good, maybe, but at least interesting). <br /> <br />If you're a big U2 fan who's still curious, pick this up used: it usually goes for really cheap, usually $1-3. Just to have \\"Mofo\\" and \\"Staring At The Sun,\\" that's a pretty fair deal.
B00003CX5P|3.0|For only the legions of serious Star Wars fans do I write. I am only going to discuss my feelings about this movie.The DVD in itself is fine with all the extras and deleted scenes, it's quite fascinating really but it's unfortunately not Star Warsesque for me.We all were very excited about episode 1 when it came out in 1999,it was the most anticipated movie in history,16 years after episode 6, a storyline taking place 32 years before episode 4. And in this lies the dilemma. The backstory, we know automatically that certain characters won't exist yet. Luke,Han,Leia,Chewie,Darth Vader,the imperial stormtroopers,Lando,Boba Fett, there's no rebellion against an evil galactic Empire,there's no Millenium Falcon or Tie fighters or X-wings,the wisdom of Yoda when he was on Dagobah,the great comraderie of the lovable droid duo R2-D2 and C3PO.If one looks for all of these characters one will sourly be dissapointed and furthermore comparing characters from the classic to this is no contest. Luke or Anakin,  Darth Vader or Darth Maul, Chewbacca or Jar Jar Binks, Leia or Padme, Old Obi-Wan or young Obi-Wan, artoo and threepio of the trilogy or of the prequel plus no Han for anybody to match up. The Classic Trilogy wins hands down. but most essentially what the Phantom Menace lacked was an EDGE.How many people can honestly say that they despised the villainous Darth Maul,most likely nobody,especially that I know of,however in episode 4 within just a little under 40 minutes Darth Vader without needing to wield a lightsaber made us fear and hate him.He was THE EDGE to Star Wars.When I used the word despise I'm using it reverently in the sense of a character you love to hate.A truly dark character. Darth Maul desperately needed to wield his lightsaber in episode 1 just to emphasize that his character had some sort of personality. What was disapointing about Maul was how he was underutilized by Lucas. We know that Palpatine was Sidious, there never was any mystique about that,we know he used the Trade Federation to catapult himself to become Supreme Chancellor with the help of his Queen's vote of no confidence in Valorum's leadership and therefore after earning a nomination to succeed Valorum he would ultimately earn a sympathy vote by the senate and became the new Chancellor.  <br /> The Phantom was not a very complicated story as people intend it to be, it's a rather simple story what, that I daresay never needed or even deserved to be given the royal treatment as a two hour feature. It's how the future Emperor ascends to power and in doing so indirectly results with the discovery of the slave boy who will one day become the dark lord of the Sith Darth Vader. Palpatine,Valorum,Qui-Gon,and Obi-Wan, are factors that lead to his discovery and Darth Maul and the duel of fates that will contibute to skywalker's descend from the light. Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi knight and Anakin first meets his true love padme(his future bride and mother of Luke and Leia). That's episode 1 in a nutshell. That could have been told in ten minutes flat.What isn't explained at all is why  the Trade federation blockaded Naboo in the first place. Obviously we know that Sidious forced them into it in what he was seeking but what the heck were they supposed to get out of it. The prologue states that the taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute , most people say what?! What does that mean? I'm lost already. The Trade federation is upset about the taxing of routes that they use for traveling, equivalent say to being charged 65 bucks by your homestate for using your local highways  <br />and expressways that they never did but are now doing. If it was explained in episode 1 that Palpatine led a committee in the senate levying severe taxes for years and years and crippling the trade industry it might just be plausible enough to understand that, now we all understand why they're blockading Palpatine's Queen's planet of Naboo, it's a direct opposal against Palpatine's cruelty with heavy taxes of legislation against the Trade Feraration.Now they're enraged to a boiling point and have taken severe action.  UNFORTUNATELY WE NEVER LEARN OF ANY EXPLANATION OF WHY THEY BLOCKADE THE PLANET.WHERE JUST SUPPOSED TO SIMPLY ACCEPT THAT THEY ARE. We know that Jar Jar Binks was a dope, if he had been exiled because he challenged authority and was considered a threat to Boss Nass and his control it just may have worked.Not because he was clumsly. If he was a strongly muscled creature with a tough voice and no nonsensed he would have been a very affable <br /> character. Natalie Portman was kind of like an enigma, she was good as the Queen but wooden and unappealing as padme.You just couldn't feel her character. Ewan's a talented actor so they say but you learn nothing about Obi-Wan from him his performance. Not to say it's entirely his fault,it's the writing and direction by Lucas in this one, now in episode 4 Sir Alec Guiness was brilliant, watching him perform, you could feel the force. His Obi-Wan was a link to the past. We only know Obi-Wan from him. Jake Lloyd a kid playing Anakin?He wasn't good. You needed someone in my opinion that was a little older, Anakin should have been portrayed as teenager around 17. And he creates C3PO? NO WAY. That's cheesy. Now when I watch Empire and see Han get frozen in carbonite In that great and powerful scene and observe Vader brooding amidst the smoke and witness C3PO strapped to chewie's back I shudder to think that's his former creator over there when Darth was a young kid ANI .Please! I know a lot of people liked the pod race but I felt that it lessoned the seriousness of the Queen's plight. All these silly and goofy looking aliens racing in pods. Gimme a brake. The jedi council was weak, it had the makings to be something cool but we only hear from Yoda And Mace Windu and conehead Ki-Adi Mundi. Why bother even having the rest. Could you imagine those actors, yeah I was in episode 1 the Jedi Temple I was one of the Jedi Masters who just sat there, you barely saw me I hope they give me a line in the next movie if my character makes the cut which some of them didn't. In the trilogy you had Yoda and Kenobi, now you get a plethora of Jedi and it's not exciting, because they're just sitting there in comatose states. Give me a good blaster any day. When a Sith is revealed, a stir is not caused, what would have been cool is for Anakin to ask Qui-Gon\\"what was that?\\"And Qui-Gon would have responded by telling Anakin about the history of the Sith. And in a magnificent flashback the firt one and most likely only one ever to be used.This would be the EDGE. How about it an intro to the planet Sith many Sith warriors fighting Jedi and each other.That would have been excellent. The battle droids were were stupidly designed,a stiff wind looks as if it could knock a battle droid of its feet.I will admit that the Droidekas(destroyer droids) were cool. ultimately the ruination of episode 1 was the weakness of characterization,horrible writing,lackluster characters without any depth. No substance.Unlike the trilogy I never felt anything for these characters. All in all I gave it 3 out 5 stars not to be cruel but also not to be kind. Mainly because there was no passion or great emotion from the actors,the acting was ridiculously wooden. I love balance between drama and action. Never the lopsidedness of one over the other.
0440237688|4.0|I thought this was a very thought provoking and well written book. It's an easy book to read (most people probably read it in a day or two). This would be a perfect book for people who enjoy going to book clubs and discussing a book. You could have a discussion on it for hours.  <br /> <br />I however DID NOT like how the ending ended like that..... leaving it up for you to decide how you wanted it to end. The book needed to go into a more detailed ending leaving it as it did to me was a little unacceptable. (But that's why it is also a good book to discuss in a book club)  <br /> <br />I thought the book also did a poor job of explaining things that are kind of important like why no one could see color, how the Giver can pass on a memory with only a touch of his hand.... etc.....  <br /> <br />Regardless of the ending I think its great that elementary/junior high schools are having kids read this book. It's a book that's easy to read, it makes you think, it's a book that gives you something to talk about, it's a book where you can draw several different opinions on and have a very lively discussion which is all the qualities you look for in a book, especially for young people whose minds are still developing.

Steal this album was good, but you could tell it was scrap tracks. <br /> <br />This album.... how do I start...... <br /> <br />Darin seriously needs to shut up and play guitar. I think hes taking his sweet revenge out on us with his horrid singing. <br /> <br />Serj.... what can i say... he is by far one of the most talented vocalists out there. Such quality with no effort at all. This guy is going to shine something fierce. <br /> <br />I hope hypnotize is closer to their first to than to this one. A few of these tracks grew on me, but there first album reached out and stole me. Cmon guys, get your sh*t together and rock my fu**ng head off....
B000002H33|5.0|Either this album or Black Sabbaths \\"Paranoid\\" is the greatest metal album ever. Personally I think Paranoid is better but if you asked most people they would tell you that Master Of Puppets is the best. This isnt my favorite Metallica album, I think Ride The Lightning is better but this album was huge, it was the benchmark of heavy metal, its like The \\"Dark side Of The Moon\\" or The \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts club Band\\" of Metal. Heres what I think of the songs.     1.Battery (5/5)- awesome acoustic intro building up the mood until you get blown away by the Hulking main riff.  2.Master Of Puppets (5/5)-awesome riff, song about drug Addictions taking over peoples lives,Metallicas best song  3.Thing That Should Not Be (5/5)- very creative lyrics about some killer underwater sea monster  4.Welcome Home (Sanitarium) (5/5)- I just call it Sanitarium instead of Welcome Home, Ballad type song about patients in an asylum breaking free from their cages  5.Disposable Heroes (4.5/5)- song about the government sending soldiers too die in war, Great Lyrics \\"Back too the front, you will do what I say when I say, You will die when I say you must die\\"  6.Lepper Messiah (4/5)- the riff is kinda weak but still a good song  7.Orion (4/5)- Awesome instrumental track  8.Damage Inc. (2.5/5)- I dont know why so many people like this song its not that good, the worst track on the album    If you like metal buy this album, its a must have.    If you liked this album you might also like:  Slayer- Reign In Blood  Anthrax- Among The Living  Pantera- Cowboys In Hell  White Zombie- La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Vol. 1

B0007CNXUK|2.0|Johnny Depp put in a good performance in this movie. And that's the problem. I expect an actor of his caliber to show me something on the screen that will blow me away every single time. (Sorry about that,  but Johnny has spoiled me). Instead what I saw was an actor reigned in. Did the money-mafia intercede somewhere along the line and say \\"no funny stuff..we're going for main stream here. Think Oscar.\\"  Kate Winslet just was not credible in the role of a woman dying of a progressive, wasting disease.  Really?!  When Barrie finally reveals Neverland to her, supposedly on the eve of her death, she looks like nothing but the beautiful English girl that she is. As fresh and as robust as the proverbial milkmaid. As for Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman...what about them? Their parts could of been played by actors of lesser talent and the final product would not have suffered for it . This is not the worst movie ever made but it's got to be the worst misuse of acting talent in recent history. Finding Neverland is a medicore commercial product. The invitation implied gourmet but on arrival I got fast food. And I really, really  wanted to LIKE this movie.
0385510454|4.0|I recently completed Broker, An excellent storyline with a visit to Italy. The book initially caught my attention and I couldnt put it down, but it stretched too much. I think Grisham tried to put too many things. The book is very interesting but the end was very typical. I expected the ending to be much more thrilling. Overall a good book.
1585473316|5.0|Mma. Precious Ramotswe muses, \\"I must remember how fortunate I am in this life, at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the veranda of my home in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white.\\" Our wise protagonist has much to be thankful for, indeed. Now in her late thirties, (\\"the very finest age to be\\"), Mma Ramotswe is a successful entrepreneur, a top notch detective, the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, engaged to be married to the wonderful Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, (the best mechanic in Botswana), foster mother of two lively children, homeowner, and a most respected member of the community.<br /><br />Her life is not free of care, however. There are problems with her adopted son, a date has yet to be set for her wedding, and friend and colleague Grace Makutsi is having trouble finding a husband. Savvy assistant detective Makutsi, who has picked-up  business acumen from her boss, opens the \\"Kalahari Typing School For Men,\\" with a little help from her friends. This special all male school is necessary, as the guys are ashamed to sit in class with women. When Mma Makutsi is not busy looking for suitors, she is searching for potential students.<br /><br />And across town there is new found competition for the Ladies' Detective Agency - always No. 1 in my book. Until recently, Precious Ramotswe  had the only PI office in Gaborone. However, the \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency\\" has just opened its doors and is ready for business. Arrogant, aggressive Cephas Buthelezi, the owner, a retired NYC cop, and a male chauvinist if there ever was one, is a master at fighting dirty. He has reopened the issue about a woman's place in the sleuth business...and is making inroads with the local clientele. He advises potential customers to, \\"Entrust your enquiries to a MAN!\\" Needless to say, the financial problems which have longed plagued Mma Ramotswe, significantly increase with the competition.<br /><br />New cases include, a well-to-do engineer from Lobatse, who hires Mma Ramotswe to assist him in righting the wrongs he committed in the past. And, a potentially philandering husband is investigated with disturbing results.<br /><br />Author Alexander McCall Smith's series is so outstanding because of his phenomenal characters, although the storylines are fascinating, and his elegant but simple writing style makes reading enjoyable. Precious Ramotswe is a jewel - an absolute original. Extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities, she possesses a keen perception of the human character. Along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, Mma Ramotswe inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"<br /><br />JANAion. <br />  <br />New cases include, a well-to-do engineer from Lobatse, who hires Mma Ramotswe to assist him in righting the wrongs he committed in the past.

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Daron has just got to stop singing.  Serj's unique, sometimes amazing vocals are arguably System's best asset.  I can't believe how much of a step back this is for System.  Songs like Cigaro have nothing to offer.  Compare this album to Toxicity, you'll hardly know you're listening to the same band.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Going for the One was a radical change in musical direction for Yes after the epic spiritual musings of the previous three albums; the music was startlingly clear and cohesive, to the point of being real prog ROCK with the title track and Parallels. With this album, Yes came exploding back onto the prog scene like thoroughbreds out of the gate. And explode this album does. On Going for the One, you have Howe wailing away on rock pedal steel LONG before Robert Randolph. You have the rhapsodic interplay of guitar and piano on Turn of the Century. Then Parallels explodes into your headphones with its pounding intro church organ chords (to this day, whenever I see a church organ, I desperately want to sit down and pound those four chords out like there's no tomorrow), and rocks out with an intensity previously not heard on Yes records. The gentle Wondrous Stories enchants with its delicate keyboards and vachalia. Then, one of the mighty Yes epics of all times; Awaken. The beautiful, breezy beginning, the flying guitar solos of Howe in the middle parts (folks, he's playing a 12-string there; do you know how hard it is to play a 12-string that fast?!); the eerily quiet harp and triangle section, with the church organ joining in, that gradually builds and builds to the earth-shaking climax of church organ, choir and guitars that leads back to the same gentle beginning theme at the end. Altogether a symphonic masterpiece that in my opinion outdoes And You And I, Heart of the Sunrise, and even Nous Sommes du Soleil (but not the Gates of Delirium). This album is a progressive rock landmark, at a time when prog rock was beginning its wane. Yes was truly at the top of their game for this recording.
0446310786|5.0|This epic novel is one of the best that I've read.This story has to do with the contraversial issues of racism.Taking place in the days where african-americans really didn't get respect,it is precise in every detail,and gives the reader a front row seat at the events that happen.Harper Lee is a critically acclaimed novelist,and this book gave her a place in the world of literature forever.       <br /> <br /> <br />           -Great Book! Recommended!!!!!!!! <br />
B00009Z574|3.0|Even a bad album by Yes is better by far than a good album by most groups out there, due to the superior musicianship of the members. That being said, if you have experienced the jaw-dropping mastery of Yes in their Fragile to Going for the One years, this album is a significant letdown. The songs Future Times/Rejoice and Onward are pretty good, but not up to the standard that Yes was capable of. The songs Don't Kill the Whale, Release Release, Arriving UFO and Circus of Heaven were the turkeys that dragged it down for me. The only two really Yes-worthy good tunes on the disk are Madrigal and On the Silent Wings of Freedom. I guess it's worth getting if you don't mind hitting the advance button a few times. The later albums Drama and 90125 prove that a change in artistic direction does not have to result in mediocrity; too bad this album didn't rise to that occasion.
B0000CGV00|5.0|I was introduced to the title track \\"Credo\\" (Arvo Part) by something I heard on public radio. After purchasing it, that was the only track I generally listened to. This is a powerful, orchestrated, piece; unlike any other Arvo Part I have heard. <br /> <br />However there's a much subtler side to this CD... <br /> <br />Over the past few weeks I found myself listening to the Corigliano track almost daily. What an incredibly expressive performance. This twelve minute journey passes thru several musical textures. Some of my favorite moments are when one hand is playing straight Beethoven and the other is off in another, more modern, space. <br /> <br />The second piece, Beethoven solo piano is a wonderful anchoring piece, to bring one back to the roots of this whole CD, that of master Beethoven himself. <br /> <br />I'm trying to convince an accomplished pianist friend to add this piece to his repertoir. <br /> <br />I'm interested in more _expressive_ piano recordings like this one's first track. <br /> <br />- Jeff
038073186X|5.0|Shutter Island is about Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal sent to Shutter Island to investigate a missing woman. Things look suspicious right off the bat, and Teddy (and his partner Chuck) start to realize that things aren't what they seem.<br /><br />I thought this book was well-written; and the hugest selling point for me was the twist in the ending. In fact, I'd advise you not to read ahead in the other reviews (some which contain spoilers), so the ending is a surprise. A very entertaining book!
B0000640VO|5.0|Another Ran-Right-Out-And-Bought Production...I loved Loved LOVED this movie!  There are a few adult scenes but they are so amusingly done (not smutty like American films would be) that they are almost safe to watch with your folks.  While watching this movie, my husband turned to me and asked, \\"Would you mind if I fell in love with her (Audrey)?\\" I said I didnt mind at all; I was nearly in love with her myself.  This is a beautiful, fantastic movie.  What is it about the French...
6305428522|5.0|I just saw \\"Quiz Show\\" last night for the first time. It should have won the 1994 Academy Award for Best Picture instead of that annoying, shallow pap titled \\"Forrest Gump.\\" Not only was the story and acting in \\"QS\\" much better than in \\"FG,\\" it also had paid incredible attention to period detail without resorting to cheap FX gimmicks to make its point or advance the plot.    \\"QS\\" is not merely a fascinating period piece of a landmark event in recent US history, but is also very much a \\"man's movie\\"---and I don't mean some shallow, bicep-flexing, explosion-filled \\"action film.\\" What I mean by \\"man's movie\\" is that \\"QS\\" does a fine job of showing how men interact with each other at all levels, personally and professionally; accurately and honestly exploring the concepts of competition, status, fame, behavior, friendship and the meaning of personal honor and compassion, when not in the presence of women. The supporting women characters in films like these, although \\"once removed\\" from the immediate action, interestingly enough, play strong, vital and highly influential roles far beyond their immediate circumstances and respective time periods. The only other film I can recall that does this as well as \\"QS\\" is the obscure 1956 Rod Serling-scripted \\"Patterns.\\"    To me, Ralph Fiennes as Columbia University luminary Charles van Doren and John Turturro as blue-collar Queens resident Herb Stempel, both contestants on the rigged game show \\"Twenty-One,\\" were each fascinating male character studies. Stempel was portrayed as envious and disdainful of elite \\"WASP\\" van Doren and this propelled him to expose the rigged show to the media and the federal government. After van Doren was ruined in front of the House investigating committee, Stempel, experiencing a sudden \\"epiphany,\\" honestly and sincerely felt compassion for the man he previously despised and envied and indirectly helped discredit.    The van Doren character had lamented that he had, throughout his life had \\"risen onthe wings of others,\\" but in truth he never really had had a chance to stretch his own wings at all. Stempel and van Doren had both been considered frustrated \\"second raters,\\" so to speak, in their respective worlds. Stempel was very intelligent but a working-class man who, deep down, thought himself a failure. Van Doren, who would have anywhere else been at the top of the mountain, was considered a second-rater within his own stunningly brilliant family. Going on a TV game show had been, for both of them as they saw it, a sort of once-in-a-lifetime chance to quickly and completely break out of their seemingly suffocating existences in the hope of gaining what they thought would have been some real respect (too often confused with transitory and superficial \\"fame.\\") The money they each had won was a nice benefit, but less important then the chance to somehow be truly, as it were, \\"somebody,\\" completely through their own efforts. However, much like Luigi Pirandello's hapless characters in his \\"Six Characters in Search of an Author,\\" van Doren and Stempel were in truth mere expedient, rootless simulacra, just passing through on the long wave of television viewer ratings.    Both men, as the scandal played itself out, soon became two of the earliest casualties of what was soon to become the relentless and short-memoried American \\"celebrity culture\\" which rewards handsomely yet punishes severely and is all too maddeningly fickle, and moreover, can have a deeply suffocating nature of its own. So many of us grab for fame as a cheap substitute for love and respect in a world around us which is even more \\"celebrity\\" dominated than it was in 1959; the ever-more pervasive and intrusive TV always raising the stakes, subtly and repeatedly telling us that deep down none of us really \\"measure up\\" to the endless parade of images of the \\"beautiful people and places\\" it relentlessly transmits, now 24 hours per day all over the planet. Friedrich Hegel had once written that what is reasonable is real. If he had experienced the history of television, and especially the 1959 quiz show scandals, he might have quickly retracted that claim.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Besides the catchy inventive singles of \\"Dirrty\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", this album is stripped of anything worthwhile.    Of course, four worthwhile songs on one album isn't anything to scoff at either.  The problem is all the boring, droning filler songs that occupy the space inbetween.    While I appreciate the confessionals (\\"Sorry I'm not a virgin, sorry I'm not a slut\\") it really detracts from what the rest of the album has to say.  Which is, overall, surviving.    I dunno, take from it what you will.  Just...make sure you get this cheap.    Added 6/29/05 - I just rediscovered the song \\"Make Over\\".  Wow!  Where did *this* come from?!  I am entirely impressed, and sort of wish I could add a half-star to my rating.  *sigh*
B000002UZ4|5.0|First of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the 80's with this collection!!!! Each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again!!!!! With the beginning of the album which would be \\"West End Girls\\" to \\" Jealously\\"!!!!!! If you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band,but for the great 80 songs that take us back in the day!!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|There is no end to the amount of fun one person can have while listening to Andrew W.K.'s debut album, I Get Wet.  It's fast paced, anthemic, and hard hitting.  You walk away from it feeling so inspired, so alive.... <br /> <br />I stumbled onto him, to be honest.  I don't remember how, but I am so grateful for finding this album.  You just can't go wrong with it!  I'll break it down for you. <br /> <br />1.  It's Time To Party - Remember that expedia commercial (I think) where the parents imagine their sons having a raging party in their absence?  That's this song.  It only sets the mood. <br /> <br />2.  Party Hard - If your head ain't movin by the first few seconds of this song, GO AWAY.  Don't turn back.  This album is NOT for you. <br /> <br />3.  Girls Own Love - This is the first song hinting to the true talent of Andrew W.K.  Combining the deep bass guitar and twinkling keyboards, he creates a happy hard rock coaster here.  Nothing special though. <br /> <br />4.  Ready To Die - Fun in a basket!  I believe this is aimed at those to blame for 9/11, and if it isn't, it's perfectly timed! <br /> <br />5.  Take It Off - Not a horribly memorable track but it may appease some anthem fans. <br /> <br />6.  I Love NYC - Again, I think this is post-9/11 music here.  Most people didn't have as much love or pride for being from NYC until those attacks, but to be honest, this song always applies. <br /> <br />7.  She Is Beautiful - THE BEST song on the entire CD.  You can't help but have to catch your breath after this one.  You *will* be singing your heart out to it! <br /> <br />8.  Party Til You Puke - A bit excessive, if you ask me.  Parties are fun and all, but vomiting?  Really now... <br /> <br />9.  Fun Night - A slower song, but not \\"slow\\" by any means.  It's fun, definitely. <br /> <br />10.  Got To Do It - Also not a very memorable song.  Probably the one that sounds like 80's Hair Metal the most. <br /> <br />11.  I Get Wet - Title track, and damnably good!This one is just as much energy as She Is Beautiful, but more repetitious.  You'll love this one too. <br /> <br />12.  Don't Stop Living In The Red - A big hint at what his sophomore album is going to sound like.  This song seems to be more musically aimed than the rest of the album.  A shame it's too short... <br /> <br />If that doesn't help you figure out whether you want this album, flip a coin.  Kiss the coin when it tells you to buy it and you end up loving it.
B0002234LS|5.0|Facts first: Secret Window is based - loosely - on a novella by Stephen King. I've never read the book, but I did love the movie, and let me tell you why. <br />Secret Window is about a writer by the name of Morton Rainey (played brilliantly as usual by Johnny Depp) who is in the middle of a nasty divorce from his wife Amy (Maria Bello). Mort suffers from a bad case of writer's block, probably caused more by the fact that he caught Amy with Ted Milner (Timothy Hutton) than anything else. He lives in an isolated cabin in the middle of the woods a good few miles from the nearest town, and is in such a mess that he can't even bring himself to sign the divorce papers. <br />Enter John Shooter (played with quiet, menacing conviction by John Turturro), a Mississippi farmer who shows up on Mort's doorstep with an accusation of plagiarism. Turturro is great, but perhaps a tad underused in this film. His Southern drawl adds a strange element of creepiness to his performance here, and his most memorable line is, \\"I'll burn your life and everyone in it like a cornfield in a high wind\\", which despite its almost cliched threat, is delivered convincingly enough for me to have rated this movie as deserving of five stars. <br />Mort's life proceeds to descend into absolute chaos. His dog is killed, an old man from town is killed, his private detective is killed...the suspense is nail-biting. David Koepp's directing is fantastic, and upheld nicely by Fred Murphy's moody cinematography and Philip Glass's appropriately menacing score. <br />The ending in particular was a work of master genius, and as Mort says numerous times, the ending is the most important part of the story. As a writer myself, I tend to agree, and this one does not disappoint. I personally am not a big fan of happy endings, and if you're anything like me, you'll absolutely adore this one. It took my breath away. <br />Call me biased, but I found Secret Window to be an excellently crafted and dramatic piece. The script calls for Depp to be alone most of the time, and he carries it off marvellously with a certain claustrophobic twitchiness. Mort's quirks and tics speak volumes about Depp's ability as an actor: the character is confused, driven, horrified, furious and depressed, and sometimes more than one of these at any given moment. Worse yet, Depp can't hide from his pretty face: all the things about Mort's appearance that should turn anyone in their right mind off - wild blond-streaked hair with dark roots, a filthy, ratty bathrobe, glasses, even braces - only serve to accentuate the perfection of one of Hollywood's most intriguing actors. <br />Go see this movie, especially if you hate happy endings. The plot won't disappoint you, the score is good, and there are some genuinely thrilling parts. If you find the plot growing predictable, however, keep your eye on Depp as he turns increasingly inventive and morbidly comic, and watch for details, like what Mort has half-open on his coffee table. <br />The bottom line: the strength of Depp's performance alone makes Secret Window worthwhile to watch. <br />Me? I bought the damn DVD.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I had never heard of this film. I saw it and read some of the reviews and saw that it was supposed to be a takeoff of my favorite play of all time, TAMING OF THE SHREW, by William Shakespeare. That was enough for me to buy it. <br /> <br />It must be admitted that the movie is very loosely based on TAMING OF THE SHREW but the operative words are VERY LOOSELY. Some of the names are right and the rough outline of the idea are there as is the shrewish nature of the elder daghter. After that, the divergance goes pretty wide. That didn't stop it from being a good show. <br /> <br />The premise of the story is that there are two daughters with a controlling father. Everyone wants to date the youngest daughter but there is a catch. The younger cannot date until the elder does. Since the eldest is so hard to get along with, Pop thinks that the girls will be safe well into their 40's. That doesn't stop the scheming. A boy is paid to get the elder to go out with him, opening the way for the younger. No one couted on them falling for each other. <br /> <br />Some of the elements of Shakespeare's play are not present. This is almost mandatory since the original is anything but politically correct. Kate, the eldest, is played as a shrew but she never becomes tamed. Her famous speech from act 5, or an analog, is not present. Neither are the identities of Bianca's suitors switched to fool the dad. As I said, it was loosely based. <br /> <br />I never heard of either of the girls playing the leads but they do a good job. The father seemed familiar, though I don't know his name, and did a great job in his role racking up the laughs. Other minor parts also added magnificently to the whole. <br /> <br />This is a great movie and lots of fun. Sit back and enjoy it. Aftwwards, check out Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's TAMING OF THE SHREW. Once you get used to the language, it too is a fun movie.
B00064MW6K|1.0|For one hour and 44 minutes, even Halle Berry's exotic beauty cannot salvage the credibility of \\"Catwoman,\\" a comic book-cum-box office joke. The movie was released July 23, 2004, and by some miracle of God grossed $16,728,411 at the weekend box office, almost $2 million more than the sensational \\"Spider-Man 2.\\" <br /> <br />Berry's leather cat-suit seems a bit much (or little), especially the way over-the-top mask, which would hardly keep her identity a secret to Benjamin Bratt's character Tom Lone, the detective she's dating as Patience Phillips and who she continually bumps into as Catwoman. Indeed, Berry is more likeable as the apologetic, forgettable advertising artist Patience Phillips. <br /> <br />Added to the mix is the awkward subplot with Frances Conroy as Ophelia Powers, a former college professor-turned-Catwoman expert. Her house is overrun with cats, including the extraordinary Midnight, an Egyptian Mau, which supposedly is a cat with supernatural powers. To tell the truth, the sight of the adorable, cuddly Midnight almost makes the $5 paid for a student ticket worthwhile. Almost. <br /> <br />In short, this film is a laugh and a half, but was obviously not meant that way. I am thoroughly disappointed that two such credible stars as Halle Berry (\\"Swordfish,\\" \\"Monster's Ball\\") and Benjamin Bratt (\\"Traffic,\\" \\"Miss Congeniality\\") would sacrifice their dignity by associating themselves with such a production. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Miss Berry already has a comic book identity. Was \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X-2\\"'s weather-manipulating, ivory-haired Storm persona simply too credible? <br /> <br />My Rating: One star (out of however many you want: five, ten, five hundred) <br />Rated: PG-13, for action violence and some sensuality
B00005UEAR|5.0|Can I just say...listening to this album has been the most wonderful experience since the dark side of the moon and Ok computer....A sweeping statement I know...but its true.This album has everything u would want as a conoisseur of art or even simply a leyman music listener..So let me start of with the review: <br /> <br />Disk 1 is good..Really good.the kind of stuff u would expect from a progressing prog metal band.The glass prison is an absolute masterpiece!...The guitar solo for starters is just mind boggling..So artistic,so beautiful and not just pettrucci wanking of on the wah or the wammy for a change!And has Pottnoy improved like a million times by any chance or is it the sleek production or say a drum machine creating an illusition of drumming from outa space to say the least!...I mean the fillins and the rolls in blind faith are just so----can barely even find the words...that its almost not even real!He does just what ever he feels like--starts of the role in the middle of a bar,extends it in the next and still manages to hold the insane time signature!..misunderstood is really nice,tho i really wish they dont make it so vague inbetween....disappear is almost a cross between karma police and exit music!..lol...fabulous song tho. <br /> <br />Disc Two according to me is where the real stuff lies..While Disc one portrays technique that leaves your jaws dropped...this disc showcases the simple fact that these guys can go into their zone if they want to ..where the level of thinking lies on a different plane itself.This is what separates bands like DT and radiohead from the rest...Just that once they entre their zone..its pure genius all the way...Love overture..But whats fantastic is how they manage to integrate the various sub bits of this piece in all their other pieces...Every time they do that...it just sends chills down your spine...coz its pure wonderful melody coming in from straight prog rock...The best part for me starts from good night kiss and goes all the way to the end.The lyrics from here play a BIG part.and the orchestral arrangement is just SO WONDERFUL.Nice jazz clip in solitary shell...and the last piece the grand finale is just so beautiful and sad and nice...and the theme of the album is essentially understood with the last verse...where it all makes sense...kind of like what eclipse does on dark side of the moon... <br /> <br />This album for me beats scenes hollow...Almost makes it look amature...(the drumming sure as hell does!)...This is where they come into their own..Once u hear this u know they cant go any higher..like OK comp for radiohead or led zep 4.hence the only way is down...As is the case in train of thought-which by the way is the most crappy piece of junk DT has written till now!! <br />Anyways a definite buy if ur a fan of radiohead and floyd..if u arent u will be left wondering as to what the hell is going on..
B000929AJQ|2.0|As a true NIN fan...this album did nothing but disappoint. <br /> <br />I'm truly sad. <br /> <br />I could get into deep descriptions on why, but it's not necessary. Just listen to a few songs, you'll understand. <br /> <br />Why Trent?!?! Why?!?!
B0000C1733|4.0|\\"Love Rollercoaster\\" is missing. That was the big \\"Beavis and Butthead Do America\\" hit! And it was a kick ass 'Peppers hit at the time too. I'm a little disappointed so I'll give it a 4. The rest of the album ROCKS!!!!
B00005RIKI|5.0|Great Album, Freebird ROX! This is one of Skynyrd's Best Albums, Classic Skynyrd through and threw, not any of the boring \\"Vicious Cylcle\\" crap that Johnny wrote. I should mention that the viewer who gave this album 1 star (Himo Pohonen) never gave any of the items he has reviewed more than 3 stars. He is clearly biased and only likes Led Zeppelin(Not that liking Led Zeppelin is a bad thing, thier cool). Buy this album, Second Helping, or 1 More for the road, stay clear of any Skynyrd album made past 1987.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is, hands down, my favorite Disney animated movie and the only one I have no reservations about letting my four year old daughter watch. Finally, a young heroine in a Disney movie who isn't the helpless princess in need of rescue by the handsome prince so she can go off and become a docile teenage bride. <br /> <br />Mulan is smart, tough, loves her family and is a little bit rebellious. If there is any \\"princess\\" I want my daughter to want to emulate it would be Mulan. The folks at Disney might not be sure whether Mulan is one of the Princesses, but in my house, Mulan is the best princess of all. <br /> <br />This is one of the most watchable and most fun of all the Disney cartoons (ok, Lion King might be better taken on the whole, but--especially if you have a little girl--Mulan is the best).
B00005YU1O|1.0|I had a number of problems with this movie. For a movie that tries so incredibly hard to be profound, the concepts in it are not terribly original, nor particularly conciousness expanding. This movie is basically a series of lectures on philosophy, that someone put in different setting and animated. The concepts given kept me interested for all of around 10 minutes, by which time the endless repitition of the same basic concepts became tiresome. <br /> <br />This movie is perfect for people who are in need of something they can watch so that they feel smarter about themselves. However, for someone with serious interest in these topics I would recomend avoiding this movie.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Considered by many to be Slayers best album, I tend to agree considering it is the better of the two I own.  The other being South of Heaven.  This is a good album.  Slayer has a great tone of just controled chaos and I like it.  I don't believe some one can go wrong buying this album if you like heavy, hard music.  Slayer is good but for me, Pantera takes the crown along with Master Of Puppets.  Slayer comes in a close third.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Their first album was their best.  Toxicity was better as well.  However, it's better than Steal This Album.  If you want to check out some groups that are political try out Skinny Puppy's The Greater Wrong of the Right and Ministry's Houses of the Mole.  I think they're better efforts than this one.
B000021XS0|5.0|A friend of mine gave me this recording. I was immediately blown away at the brilliance and genius of what went into making this disc! There were many influences evident when I heard the album. I heard parts that had tinges of Pink Floyd, Rush, Metallica, Jethro Tull, Frank Zappa, Jan Hammer from a Mahavishnu stand point and even a part with an Indian (east Indies)flavor. Admittingly, I am not too familiar with Dream Theater's music. Being a musician myself, these musicians are virtuosos! Mike Portnoy's drumming is sheer genius. Mike's chops are monsterous. His dynamic range extends from subtle to explosive thrash. He reminds me of Terry Bozzio. I am not into heavy metal, but this is certainly and exception. An interesting mix of metal and progressive. John Petrucci's guitar work is of Steve Vai calliber! Amazingly fast and tight. Equally, Jordan Rudess' keyboard work was fantastic! It appears that some D.T. fans do not appreciate Jordan's contribution to this recording. I feel the color Jordan Rudess brought was brilliant! Listening to this felt like I was listening to an extreme version of Jethro Tull's \\"A passion Play\\" or \\"Thick as A Brick\\". If you like progressive, don't pass this one up! Well done D.T.! <br />
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Wow, the only thing I'm mezmerized about is how disappointing this cd is.<br /><br />After reading 5 glowing reviews in magazines i decided to purchase this cd. I have the limited edition versions of their first two cd's and own all their promo&import singles. The reviews promised this to be a \\"prog influenced batch of political thinking quirky metal\\".<br /><br />You can tell that all reviewers only copy off each other and never really listen to the album. Or, they only listen to certain trax the record comapny provides and make their half assed judgements from there.<br /><br />Here are my HUGE complaints about this bore-fest:<br /><br />1) I can't believe mags haven't mentioned the abomination of: THIS CD ONLY CLOCKS IN AT 36 MINUTES! What a friggin rip off of Sony to actually market this as \\"Wow, SOAD made two such great albums we couldn't fit em all on to one, so you get \\"Hypnotize\\" towards Novemeber\\". Are you kidding me?!?!? Both albums can fit on to one cd (the max a cd can hold nowadays is 78 minutes) and you have the nerve to charge FULL PRICE for a cd that should of been put out as an E.P. (remember those?) at half the price. A 36 min cd does not warrant full retail list price, especially when the music is as mediocre as this.<br /><br />#2) Maybe two or three songs have political or relevant social commentary to them. I've never seen a cd so full of repetitive brainless choruses and stupid lyrics about Hollywood, abusing women and watching porn. I expect this from nu metal teenage punx but not from this band who has proved they could write great lyrics.<br /><br />#3) This is barely a hard rock record! If you heard BYOB on the radio, well that is about the heaviest it gets on here. Most of this sounds like radio friendly music if it wasn't for the blathering inept lyrics that are sub-standard at best.<br /><br />4) Doesn't anybody remember that SOAD's last album was a cd called \\"Steal this album\\" which were a bunch of throw away B-sides from the two previous albums?? Reviewers say \\"their first cd in a handful of years\\"...well it's been even longer than that because the last cd was just put out to counter the bootleggers and keep fans from forgetting the band! And they had the nerve to charge full price for that cd (which came with no front cover art and were , after all only B-sides).<br /><br />And after all these years SOAD only comes out with an initial 36 minutes of music?!?!?! and You are musicians???<br /><br />Sony, SOAD, and reviwers around the globe should be ashamed of themselves for promoting such a waste of money. But, alas these are the same reviewers who claimed Metallica \\"returned to their roots\\" with the snore-fest that was \\"St.Anger\\" (and, yes, they filled all 78 minutes of that cd with music no problem). They don't want to get cut off from free tix and cd's from the label so they kiss their butts instead.

B0008G2IRO|5.0|I still vividly remember the day my sister introduced me to the Gorillaz. With my confused rap mindset, I couldn't handle a cartoon band with such melodies. About a year later , I was at a local Warehouse (CD store) and found all of their CDs for a VERY low price. I picked them all up and was instantly hooked. Now, 2 years later, Their original album has literally never left my CD player and I own all of their albums. <br /> <br />While cruising Itunes, I came upon the genius that is  <br />\\"Feel Good Inc.\\" <br /> This song has all of it, a tight rap section, swingin' vocals, a dance beat, everything. I became instantly excited, as I thought the Gorillaz had broken up. I couldn't find any information on their new CD, except the name, \\"Demon Days\\" <br />I waited, I'd check Amazon every day. The day it came to be available by pre-order, I picked it up. When it was shipped to my house, I was again entranced by their songs. I can't put the CD down. They've never done a song I didn't like, and \\"Demon Days\\" holds true to that theory. <br /> <br /> I've always been a Blur fan (I now have all of their CDs), so getting into the Gorillaz wasn't hard. I'm still lovin' it, 3 years later. <br /> <br />For song reviews: <br /> <br />Intro: After 20 seconds, I skipped it. 4/10 <br /> <br />Last Living Souls: 8/10 <br /> <br />Kids With Guns: 8/10 <br /> <br />O Green World: 9/10 <br /> <br />Dirty Harry: 8/10 <br /> <br />Feel Good Inc.: 10/10 <br /> <br />El Manana: 8/10 <br /> <br />Every Planet We Reach Is Dead: 8/10 <br /> <br />November Has Come: 8/10 <br /> <br />All alone: 8/10 <br /> <br />White Light: 9/10 (This song is thoroughly influenced by Blur) <br /> <br />Dare: 10/10 (I instantly fell in love with this song) <br /> <br />Fire Coming Out of A Monkey's Head: 9/10, it's the right blend of creepy and awesome. <br /> <br />Don't Get Lost In Heaven: 9/10 <br /> <br />Demon Days: 10/10 <br /> <br />Thanks for reading! <br />
B00082IJ08|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying this. If you're expecting something like \\"Punk\\" or \\"M1A1\\" from their self-titled debut, this isn't what you're looking for. Nevertheless, this album is still great. Danger Mouse does a great job of giving Demon Days a different feel, yet still having that Gorillaz style of being different. Some tracks can go through about 3 or 4 styles in about 3 or 4 minutes, leaving you guessing of what's coming up next. It has elements of violins, synth pop, hip-hop, funk, drum & bass, choir,   a tad bit of bossanova, and about any other genre, sub-genre, and such combined into a melting pot of cool. The album overall has a more matured sound to it than the previous. They even have Dennis Hopper doing a monologue on \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\". This album is about as close to perfect as you're going to get this summer, fall, winter, and so on. Already in my top 10 of favorite albums. <br /> <br />Highly suggested for just about anyone. Wait, no, everyone.
B000003C4K|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM! There is no question about how amazing this thrash masterpiece is. It is no doubt the best exodus album......its better than kill em' all........its almost as good as reign in blood (slitely different style).......and, well, yeah. I also love the vocals. i think i've said enough. Here are my song ratings:   <br />Bonded By Blood-great album opener, great riff, great vocals. 5/5 <br />Exodus-This song expands on the first one (really makes you want to bang your head!) 5/5 <br />And Then There were None-The song has an amazing riff! Slower than the first two but even more amazing. 6/5 <br />Lesson In violence-My personal favorite on the album. Fast and in your face classic thrash. 6/5 <br />Metal Command- First riff is slighty Priest-ish (not a problem) gets the job done well. 5/5 <br />Pirahna-Classic Exodus song (you can't resist banging your head to this) amazing song. 6/5 <br />No Love-Acoustic opening leading into a complicated riff slowest song on the album. Still good though. 4/5 <br />Deliver Us to Evil-Amazing riff. More of the same formula as ANd Then There Were None. 5/5 <br />Strike of The Beast-Fastest song on the album.Another one of my favorites, very amazing song, more of a lesson in violence. 6/5 <br />And Then There Were None (live)-Different singer, faster, very good live take (i dont really like the vocals) still good. 5/5 <br />Lesson In Violence (live)-Faster, better, i love this song live all except for the vocals. 6/5
B000001EAQ|5.0|Forget iPod, forget Bono's long hair back, forget Super Bowl, forget Beautiful Day and Vertigo and all that canned corporate radio-friendly s***. THIS IS MUSIC AND ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS. <br /> <br />Brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, Pop is the most overlooked and the most fascinating U2 album at the same time. I do like the fact that most of brianwashed fans pretend to love hit and miss prefabricated works as ATYCLB and HTDAAB, because this album needs a higher level of taste.  <br /> <br />Pop is the finest expression of U2's songwriting. Just read the lyrics and listen to the music. Of course, there aren't clich lyrics that every high school guy remember at once as Sometimes You Can't Make It, Peace On Earth, Grace, Stuck In A Moment, Miracle Drug, etc. And of course, there are no room for such stupid filler lyrics as Elevation, Vertigo, All Because Of You, etc. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, take lessons of poetry and then read the lyrics of Pop. Take lessons of songwriting and then listen to the music of Pop...meanwhile keep pretending that \\"songs\\" as Beautiful Day or Vertigo \\"rocks!\\". <br /> <br />Remember: This is ART. Can you deal with that, 2000 \\"fans\\"?...I don't think so
B00003CXE7|3.0|Gladiator by Ridley Scott won a lot of awards and was praised by a number of people. It is a gritly movie, with revenge, honor, triumph and some decent acting. It is supposed to based on history of Roman empire, but much maligned. A lot of similarities exist between this movie and Braveheart. I do notice that a number of people like both movies, probably due to the similarities. It will easily appeal to people who are drawn to battle and blood sports. Like a number of recent movies, it suffers from a lack of good screenplay. The days of great epics are gone. Many have compared it to Spartacus and found this wanting. I do not concur. Spartacus had spectacular acting and screenplay. I cannot remember any of the great lines in this movie, though it had good graphics.  <br /> <br />Spartacus on the other hand had Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas give magnificent performances. Even the lines in the movie are resplendent. That movie has stood the test of the time, which I suspect this will not. People who see such movies would say this is a movie, not a documentary, so it need not be close to the truth. In the past, directors like William Wyler used to Gore Vidal to clean up the script for movies such as Ben-Hur. Nowadays, they do not bother. If something is inaccurate why bother, very few people read about the Roman empire, its rise and fall. All they want is a brief 2 hours of spectacle. I shudder to think that they go back home thinking that what they saw was the truth. This movie had a good score and decent photography, so I give it 3 stars. I can watch a few times, but it falls short of the great epics. The laughable part was an emperor fighting with a general in the arena. I do not know who came up with that, do people who see the movie stop and think for a moment how stupid that is.
B00097DX3U|3.0|Tom Morello is a terrific guitarist.  In fits and spurts he can create terrific riffs and solos.  However, he is inconsistent.  He often seems too obsessed with his own creativity and forgets about the depth of the music he is playing.  This CD is a perfect example of his inconsistency, and, as others have said, all of his noodling eventually gets a little boring.  Audioslave has more potential than this.  They have a terrific rythm section, a great vocalist and good lyricist, and a talented guitarist.  The solution:  Mr. Morello needs to be reined in a little bit, and Mr. Cornell needs to be given a little more freedom.  Adding a few guitar licks from Mr. Cornell would do wonders for the depth of Audioslave's music.  Unless and until that happens, they will have CDs like this - good, but all too familiar.
B0007NFL18|1.0|I've never heard such sugary beats and weak lyrics ever. i would give this album 0 stars if i could. if you want to hear true hip hop check atmosphere or murs. peace
0553579908|4.0|Consider a lovemaking session without end. While such an idea may seem wonderful at first blush, on further reflection drawbacks come to mind. Part of the thrill of lovemaking-or of reading a novel-is rising tension. But tension largely produces pleasure via anticipation of a release of tension. A climax. If tension continues to rise, unceasing, and there is no climax, no release, no end, then what had once produced pleasure can eventually result in pain. <br /> <br />A Clash of Kings, the second in A Song of Ice and Fire, is very well written. The characters are well drawn, interesting and distinct, and the plot is compelling. Everything is described clearly and crisply. And yet, I once again feel compelled to rate Martin's novel four rather than the five stars that it might otherwise deserve. And, again, for the oddest of reasons. Part of an issue that I have developed with this novel is that of tension and climax. It is essentially all rising tension, as was its predecessor. For those keeping count, I've read about seventeen hundred pages of this series so far, two out of a projected six book series (or so I've heard), each being a little shy of the thousand-page mark, and hardly a thing has been resolved thus far. Prolonged rising tension, as noted earlier, can eventually graduate from pleasure to pain when there is no relief or release, and so it is, here. Martin is in love with, and good at constructing, cliffhangers. Nearly every chapter ends in a cliffhanger. I'm certain that many people would argue that this is a great feature, and what am I complaining about that for, but the problem is that people can't run marathons at a sprint pace, either literally or figuratively. Yes, as Martin wanted, the cliffhanger structure does keep me turning pages, does keep me picking up his book, all to the good. But it also has me sailing through chapters looking for something (even the slightest of matters) to be ultimately resolved, and now discouraged because I have to assume that I won't have many more answers a thousand pages from now. <br /> <br />Most novels of much shorter length sprinkle some climax and resolution throughout their plots as means of rewarding, and resting, their readers. If you eat coffee ice cream, and nothing but coffee ice cream, non-stop for hours on end, your taste buds will acclimate and eventually you won't really notice the flavor any more. However, if you rest for, say, ten minutes, every so often, when you come back to the ice cream it will again be fresh and flavorful. Action packed novels, like A Clash of Kings, need periods of rest to allow readers to replenish their emotions in order to be able to feel the rising tension again. They need some climax, and some resolution, along the way. They need some variation in pacing, shifts in speed. Especially novels, and series, as long as this one. <br /> <br />Also, and this is probably also accountable to the incredible length (and also complexity of plot), even after two gargantuan novels, it is hard to see where the series is going. It's hard to know, not what will be the final climax, but what even could be the final climax. As a for instance, somewhere near the beginning of Star Wars, we understand that eventually it will come down to a confrontation between Skywalker and Vader. In Rocky, we know that the crux will be Rocky's confrontation with Creed. In Thelma and Louise, we know that the final climax will be a resolution of their flight-either they'll find a way to get back into society, or they won't in a profound way (incarceration, death, disappearing into another country). In A Clash of Kings, there are so many major characters and so many major events all awaiting a resolution, that I can't even precisely piece out what forms the core conflict requiring resolution. Or what event short of global annihilation could bring about such a resolution. Is there a main protagonist or antagonist? Perhaps the Houses of Stark and Lannister provide those. Or, perhaps not (what of Daenerys, for instance, or the oncoming Winter)? <br /> <br />And so, I enjoy this series and think quite highly of it for many reasons. Tomorrow, I buy the third of the series. But I have little hope that I'll feel fulfilled by it-it probably will tease and leave me hanging, like the two before-which I find slightly unkind to what has to be a dedicated readership. With so much invested, and so many questions, it can only be hoped that there will eventually be answers. And Mr. Martin, if you're reading, don't take the global annihilation ploy; this series demands something better. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I don't quite know exactly when hard rock became so lame but I think it was around the mid 90's when rap metal became all the rage. Then in '98 the self-titled System of a Down album came out and there was light at the end of the tunnel. The new album delivers on the promise shown by that debut album and Toxicity. Some have complained that it is too short, but I think a lot of albums that come out today only have about 40 minutes of good music and the rest is all filler. Personally, I would rather have an album of great songs that is a bit shorter. The two part harmonies are unbelievable. Probably the best since Alice In Chains (probably one of the last metal bands before SOAD that was worthwhile). Daron's guitar work is a killer as well. I have listened to this record about 10 times and I am still not anywhere near sick of it yet. If you are a fan of System, or even if you are a rock n' roll fan in general, buy this album by one of last great American rock bands and watch as it becomes a classic, as opposed to most other so called nu metal albums, which are destined to be sold for $1.00 in fine cardboard cutout bins at a record store near you. <br /> <br /> <br />
1400031362|3.0|This is the third book of the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series and some of the novelty is starting to run down. Also comes the realization, that this is more a book about Africa and its people then about solving crimes. The mysteries, so it seems, are just a side issue to the story. This fact was indeed quite clear after the first book and I confess it did not and does not bother me; Africa is an interesting enough subject to hold a story.  I also appreciate the choice of lady detective and \\"mystery\\" as a means to unfold the tales of the African people. My criticism however is with the easy way in which the issues and problems (these are not really crimes) are solved. It seems that this gets easier from one book to the next. If solving crimes is the method you choose, then maybe you should try a little harder. It seems a little far-fetched to believe that all servants and maids confide with Mma Ramotswe and her secretary and actually hand them the answers they look for on a silver platter. Also a little disappointing that the issue of the boy with the \\"lion smell\\" presented in such an intriguing way in the beginning of the book is discarded later on with no more then a few sentences (although I did appreciate the clever conversation between Mma Ramotswe and Mma Potokwane).  <br />In this book we again follow Mma Ramotswe, our regular heroine and her faithful secretary (now promoted to the position of Assistant Detective and even acting manager of the garage) Mma Makutsi who proves to be a wonder woman. Not only she proves herself to be a great detective but also appears to hold great knowledge of cars and a lot of self-confidence.  <br />Another problem is that many of the issues return again and seem to be a little overused. A good example would be mentioning, again, for the 100th time that Mma Ramotswe is a \\"traditionally built\\" woman. OK, we understood that. It seems that the writer wants to make his point again and again.  <br />And yet, after I have spilled all my criticism, I must say that the story is a nice and easy read and the current problems of Africa are presented with a love that comes out of every sentence. Mma Ramotswe is no doubt an incredible character and I can only assume that I will also buy the next book of the series, if only to find out how is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his adopted children.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
0380733358|5.0|In the months before the Allie invasion, Adolph Hitler contemplated over where the Allie attack would occur.  Would it be Normandy or the port of Calais?  One great German spy, Henry Faber, held the photographic evidence of the Allie's true intentions.  The Eye of the Needle follows the suspenseful struggle of Faber as he uses his ingenuity and deadly skills as a German spy to try and rendezvous with the U-boat 505.  If Faber reaches the U505, the advantage of a surprise attack would be lost and the war could be over for the Allies. The keen sighted and extremely skilled Faber, (code named Die Nadel) is an exhilarating character to follow as he uses his stiletto to dispose of any opposition.  For those looking for a suspenseful historical fiction, I would highly recommend this book.  Ken Follett's Bestselling Super Thriller is a quick read and a non-stop page turner.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I am a bit tried of hearing the rantings of these guys need to \\"feel rage\\" and the like. I saw these guys in Philly a few weeks back, the new stuff sounds great (better than on the disc).  <br />I for one find it refreshing to have a less heavy album out from these guys. Furthermore, it is refreshing to hear a soild flowing rock album that is just fun to listen to.  <br />This album proves my point of what I said when I first heard that Cornell was joining the RATM guys, and that was Cornell will help influence/teach these guys more about writing music and playing their instruments. Thanks to Cornell, Rubin, and Brandon O'Brien with mixing duties, the RATM guys have learned you can make other types of riffs and they don't have to sound like a rap-like beats.  <br />I just can't wait now for the next album (hopefully it will be a double with some more of the 80+ songs I heard they have in various stages of writing).
0786890754|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was kind of cheesy at times but I stuck with it and ended up in tears at the end.  It made me not want to take my relationship for granted it was so sweet.  It was really simple to read and I whizzed through it.  When reading this kind of book I always think I know where the story is heading but I was really surprised with this one.
0802130208|5.0|This book is a comic masterpiece, it narrates the adventures and misadventures of Ignatius a not too young, highly educated gentleman who is pushed by his mother to find a job in a hostile New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Because of his humanistic studies Ignatius has a medieval and poetic perception of the reality surrounding him that results in hilarius misunderstandings when he shares his views with other characters. <br /> <br />I truly believe this novel is unique, the author must have had an extraordinary sense of humor!
B0007QJ1MK|1.0|I hate this album! I ended up giving it away it sucked so much! the only DECENT song is Little Sister, and that gets old fast!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Great from start to finish, Demon Days is an excellent follow up to their first album. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of their previous work, especially because this isn't just more of the same. It has a completely new feel, and I think it's actually better than their first release. As much as I loved their first album, there were a few songs on it I just couldn't stand (mostly towards the end of the disc), that I always skip. Not so on this album, it's on from the first song to the last. Del is one of my favorite hip-hop artists, and this album is so good it doesn't even feel incomplete without him. Very tight work, indeed.
B000007T1M|5.0|I pity the bandwagon bunch that bought toxicity first. I was going to come up with something profound, a review that avid readers could really sink their teeth into...but its all been said, much better then i could ever articulate.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|It seems that the last few years have have been a creative desert in the world of music, whether it be commercial pop, metal, alternative rock and whatever other catagory there is. Apart from a few exceptions, most popular acts today are just rehashed versions of something that came before, predictable and formula based. <br /> <br />Not System of a Down.  <br /> <br />'Mezmerize' is fresh and unpredictable, humourous yet still politically biting. Basically these guys know how to have fun, not take themselves too seriously yet voice real social issues. Regardless of how heavy or franetic the tracks of 'Mezmerize' get, there is still fantasic melody present over their deep grooves and in most cases, infectious vocal harmonies. The musical arrangements are complex and diverse yet they don't 'flog the musical log' for the sake of progressiveness. The production is outstanding, clear, tight, full and rich, you will be hard pressed to find a fault with the sound of 'Mezmerize'. <br />There are moments of commercial pop in amoungst the low end thrash and the chorus of 'B.Y.O.B' is a classic example of this. Who can resist the line \\"Everybodies going to the party, have a real good time.\\" That just goes around and around in your head for days but you don't get sick of it. And that lines double meaning is very sharp, probably refering to the allied forces or Bush's cronnies getting together to secure their superannuation by planting the ol' stars and stripes on an Iraqie oil field after their armed forces have obliterated the local populous. Anyway, take it how ever you want it, this track is a little ripper.  <br /> <br />I believe you would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't get something from this album.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Asking \\"Which Cash prison album is best: San Quentin or Folsom Prison?\\" is like saying \\"Which of your lungs is your favourite?\\". They're both essential to ANY music collection. (If pressed by a particularly menacing and armed inmate, I'd lean towards the more atmospheric FOLSOM.) Which one you like best will probably depend on whether you want a more comprehensive take on Cash's music (the love songs and gospel on this one) or one aimed square at his audience (the prison song laden \\"Folsom\\").<br /><br />Read the glowing praise from Merle Haggard (or Marty Stuart if you want someone of more recent vintage) and look at any critic's list of \\"Essential\\" country music and this will be on it. Look at the better pop critics' lists and even they will recognize this as the epochal moment in music that it is.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Choosing the best tunes here is hard, but I'll try. As on Folsom, Johnny performs an actual prisoner's song (T. Cuttie's \\"I Don't Know Where I'm Bound\\"). Cuttie's lyric is a classic tale about \\"rambling\\" and the search for identity. The reaction to the title song's line \\"San Quentin, may you rot and burn in He*l\\" is a \\"goosebump\\" moment for me. The audience loved it so much they demanded he sing it again...immediately. (Afterwards Cash remarks \\"I'm starting to like it myself\\" with a grin...) \\"Wanted Man\\" is surprisingly \\"commercial\\" for a collaboration with Bob Dylan. The \\"funny\\" songs on this one are also better than \\"Folsom\\": \\"Starkville City Jail\\" and alltime classic \\"Boy Named Sue\\" (which the liners note was being performed for the first time at this show..Cash actually had to read the lyrics off a sheet). \\"Daddy Sang Bass\\" is a great number,too...no doubt because the lyric (from Carl Perkins) reflected Cash's own upbringing. It's abetted by June Carter Cash, Perkins himself, and the Statler Brothers' harmony.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />No clunkers at all this time. There's nothing here I'd remove...and that includes the bonus songs. This is as perfect as it gets on a song by song basis.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I hope you're looking at this for 1 of 2 reasons:<br />1) You came here to vote on reviews<br />2) You're updating the copy you have to the newer remastered version.<br /><br />If it's because you don't actually own this, click \\"Buy this\\" and hope that no one sees you do it.

0440180295|4.0|I first read this book as a fifth grader more than thirty years ago. The very fact that a ten year old could read it with no difficulty at all certainly highlights the best of Vonnegut -- his completely natural, clean, flowing colloquial style. Without question, this man is a great American writer in the tradition of Mark Twain.<br /><br />Just as Vonnegut is the modern Mark Twain, so Billy Pilgrim is like Huck Finn, only floating through time instead of floating down the Mississippi. The difficulty with this novel, however, is that unlike Huck Finn the protagonist never grows up, never takes responsibility for his actions, and never really learns anything of lasting value.<br /><br />Most reviewers seem to think that the message of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is that \\"war is wrong.\\" This would parallel Twain's message in Huck Finn that slavery is wrong. Problem is, while Huck takes action and strikes out at slavery directly, by freeing Jim, Billy Pilgrim remains merely a passive spectator throughout his life. Vonnegut tries to excuse this with a lot of sci-gimmickry, about being \\"unstuck in time\\" but in the end what really comes across is not the evil of war but one man's personal surrender.<br /><br />There are other problems, more specific to Vonnegut's writing. The whole outer space adventure is fascinating at first, with Billy being a pampered prize exhibit in an intergalactic zoo, with a beautiful porn star as his mate. Thirty years ago I spent hours and hours fantasizing about this -- it's just what a ten year old would think of as the ideal sexual situation.<br /><br />But now that I'm middle aged, I wonder about certain things. Vonnegut stresses over and over again that the tiny Tralfamadorian aliens think Billy is a \\"perfect male specimen.\\" They don't know enough about the male physique to see he's a runty middle aged man. Fair enough. But then, why do they find a stunning porn star for him to mate with? Evidently they know a lot more about women's bodies than men? Why didn't they just pick up a male porn star so they could have a matched set?<br /><br />Then there's the obvious contempt Vonnegut has for women. In the Tralfamadorian sections, the aliens quiz Billy endlessly about life on earth, war, suffering, justice, free will, and so on. But nobody seems to think Montana Wildhack has anything to contribute to the discussion. And evidently there are no female aliens to ask her about the female perspective. The very fact that Vonnegut does this without thinking shows how narrow minded he really is.<br /><br />In the war sections, one notices that beneath the hippy-pleasing pacifist rhetoric there is a lot of callousness, and some strange examples of the double standard. It goes without saying, as many critics have noted, that Vonnegut refuses to discuss the bombing of Dresden in the context of Auschwitz. \\"So it goes\\" replaces more basic insights like, \\"what goes around, comes around,\\" \\"you reap what you sew\\" and \\"you raise hell, you get hell.\\"<br /><br />But there are more subtle manifestations of this. For example, Roland Weary, the vicious American soldier who picks on Billy, is particularized with great skill. His behavior is not just shrugged off with a \\"so it goes.\\" Vonnegut describes it with passion. But what Vonnegut does not do is acknowledge the fact that there are SS and Gestapo agents all over Germany who make Roland Weary look like an amateur. The only Germans we ever see are noble, long-suffering and thoroughly civilized. Even as he condemns America for fighting an unjust war in Vietnam, Vonnegut implies that the German people are in no way to blame for fighting a far more unjust war against an entire continent of people. On the one hand, he insists that free will is an illusion, and no one is responsible for anything, and on the other he condemns American brutality as if we all are personally responsible for everything our government does.<br /><br />The fact is, as rich and rewarding as SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE isas a reading experience, it's not a book you can reread after thirty years and still respect as a classic. Vonnegut has the style and grace of Mark Twain, but not the clear moral vision.as SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is as a reading experience, it's not a book you can reread after thirty years and still respect as a classic.

B000002GZ1|5.0|This is the first album from the classic chicago blues band \\"The Paul Butterfield Blues Band\\". The group was an all star line up of blues musicians which featured Paul Butterfield on harmonica and vocals. The spectacular Mike Bloomfield on lead guitar, Elvin Bishop on rhythm guitar, Sam Lay (drummer for howlin' wolf and various other blues bands) on drums, organ/pianist Mark Naftalin and bass player Jerome Arnold. This is early Bloomfield, his licks are searing and his guitar stings throughout the album. Butterfield's classic harp wails and cries ferociously. The album opens up with the gritty \\"Born In Chicago\\". They then do a cover of \\"Shake Your Money Maker.\\" The third track and one of the best, \\"Blues With a Feeling\\", has Bloomfield biting and chomping through the song. \\"Thank You Mr. Poobah\\" is a great instrumental with a bit of a jazz swing. They cover Muddy Waters \\"I Got My Mojo Working\\" solidly adding new energy into the song. \\"Mellow Down Easy\\" is a little weak but still good. They come back with the instrumental \\"Screamin'\\" which cranks. Bloomfield's licks and solos spew out of his guitar like magma. \\"Our Love is Drifting\\" is another K.O. slower blues number with more fierce guitarmanship. \\"Mystery Train\\" and \\"Last Night\\" are a little weaker but they make up for it with a cover of \\"Look Over Yonders Wall\\". <br />
B00005JN2Z|2.0|What are the chances of some cabbie picking up a fare that is later targeted on the same night by a different fare for murder.  I say, Zilch!  Its almost what this stupid movie is worth - 0 stars. But I was in a generous mood and gave it 2, only for the visual experience.  Bad plot, bad script are the tale of this movie.  Seeing all these positive reviews tells me more about the dumbing down of American society than anything!
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I want to go on and on about this album and about Ryan Adams himself but I think I'm going to keep it simple and just say that this album is absolutely incredible.  It's one of the best albums I own and, being a music fanatic, that's saying something.
B000002P72|5.0|Anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album. Sure, B.B. King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say \\"oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling\\". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of \\"Help the Poor\\", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like \\"Play it all night!\\" and \\"Tell it, B.B.!\\" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like \\"Sweet Little Angel\\", \\"Worry Worry\\", \\"How Blue Can You Get\\", and \\"You Upset Me Baby\\". An absolute must-have.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Though many accuse Alfonso Cuaron of \\"royally screwing\\" this film up, I for one agree with JK Rowling: It is my personal favorite of the three films thus far. While Cuaron does make several changes to the story, none of them harm it in the least. In fact, Rowling commented in one interview that she wished that she had invented the shrunken heads first! That aside, the actors continue to amaze, especially the trio (Harry, Ron, and Hermione). They are maturing with each film, and it is apparent. This film is much darker, so it would be wise for parents to see it first, but for everyone over the age of 12 it is an excellent and exciting ride. Mischief Managed!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|\\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" was the last album that RATM made with original songs. Although it's not as strong as \\"Evil Empire\\" and the unforgetable debut (self-titled) way back from 1992, it's still got that catchy groove, aggressive bite, and angry poetry from Zack's notebook. Not the best album to start on if you're looking into getting to know Rage (start with Evil Empire), but once you get what they're all about, you'll find yourself getting this one soon.
B00097DX3U|3.0|I dont know how these guys can put out not 1, but 2 albums of tight concise rock that really does nothing to stand out. Besides \\"Like a Stone\\" there wasn't much as far as memorable tracks. <br /> <br />I have been listening to this album for about two to three weeks and I can say that the first 5-6 songs dont seem to have much variation. \\"Be Yourself\\" is a weak first single and sounds like they are trying to capitalize of the success of \\"Like a Stone\\". There are still a few good tunes near the middle of the album. But again after 2-3 weeks of this album I still cant find one track that will make its way onto my playlist. Tom Morello sounds like has is being made to tame his playing as most the funk is gone. I think it all went to Wes Borland and the new Bizkit album since Wes rips off Tom's heavy riffs on 3-4 of the new Bizkit tracks (The propaganda, The Truth) <br /> <br />Much like the latest NIN effort, Audioslave makes an album that will please the fans. These albums however, are both safe and unoriginal when it comes to the history of these groups and their memebers. <br /> <br />OVERALL GRADE: C+
B00097DX3U|4.0|A few years ago when it was announced that former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell would be joining forces with three quarters of Rage Against The Machine (after the departure of singer Zack de la Rocha) expectations were high. Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden had been two of the best rock bands from the 1990s and the public was eager to hear what kind of collaboration this new supergroup would make. Would this supergroup, Audioslave, live up to the hype? For the most part, the answer was a resounding yes. Audioslave delivered. While some RATM and Soundgarden fans alike were disappointed, Audioslave's self-titled debut was a strong collection of songs that pleased most fans.<br /><br />Now, almost three years later, Audioslave is back for their second release \\"Out of Exile\\" an album that surpasses the debut. Although Audioslave's self-titled debut is a strong album, when it was recorded, Chris Cornel was still new to the rest of the band-guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford, and drummer Brad Wilk. Now, after three years of touring and already having one album under their belt, the band seems to have really jelled. All four members seem to have found a common ground and found what works and sounds best for the group as a whole. Audioslave seems more like a band now than just a supergroup, or an all-star collaboration of 90s alt. rock superstars.<br /><br />\\"Out of Exile\\" is essentially a straight-ahead rock album, with a real classic rock feel. This is hardly surprising when you consider that although Rage Against The Machine incorporated elements of rap and hip-hop into their formula, a lot of their riffs were firmly rooted in classic rock. And as was the case with the debut, the band has, for the most part, written songs more on the melodic side, to fit the style of the soulful Chris Cornell, as opposed to the rap/hip-hop styling of Zack de la Rocha. But as was the case with the debut, the band hasn't abandoned their sound. You can definitely hear Rage Against The Machine in Audioslave, it's just that the rap/hip elements have been left behind and a more classic rock sound has been embraced. As previously stated, the band seems to have really jelled, so the songs on \\"Out of Exile\\" sound tighter than those on the debut and the band seems more focused. In short, compared to the debut, \\"Out of Exile\\" is a leaner, meaner album.<br /><br />All twelve tracks on \\"Out of Exile\\" are quite strong. It's pretty much all killer and no filler. The CD has a good pace and never runs out of stream or looses momentum. Some of the songs, like the opening fast-paced \\"Your Time has Come, \\"Out of Exile\\" and \\"Man or Animal\\" sound very RATM-ish and probably could have been re-worked for Zack de la Rocha. These songs should please fans who have been missing RATM. Some of the album is more melodic, like the tuneful \\"Be Yourself,\\" \\"Don't Remind Me\\" and the gorgeous \\"Dandelion.\\" Fans of Soundgarden/Chris Cornell should be pleased with those. But all of the songs are tinged with elements of classic rock. \\"The Worm\\" actually sounds somewhat similar to Led Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog,\\" off their \\"ZOSO\\" album. So whether you're primarily a fan of Rage, Chris Cornell/Soundgarden or classic rock, there is something on \\"Out of Exile\\" for everyone.<br /><br />Tom Morello has proved to be one of the best guitarists of the last twenty years. He's not only technically a solid player, but he has also come up with some of the catchiest and creative riffs in years. With \\"Out of Exile,\\" Morello has come up with a new batch of songs that both bare his signature and expand upon his previous work. Morello has always had a knack for coming up with catchy and creative riffs, that sound both fresh and unique. His fans will not be let down with this release.<br /><br />Bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk have shown to be one of the most exciting and dynamic rhythm sections of the last twenty years. They have proved to be more than just the backdrop to let Morello do his thing. Their playing is thoroughly commanding, electrifying, and intense. They were essential to Rage's, and now Audioslave's sound.<br /><br />Vocalist Chris Cornell has been universally hailed as one of the best singers in rock. And while he is undoubtedly a great singer, he is also a gifted songwriter. The chemistry between Cornell and the rest of the band has grown stronger and his soulful delivery seems well-suited for the classic rock styling of Morello. Although in all honesty, Cornell is not quite the singer that he once was. He still has a fine voice, but it seems strained at times. He can't quite make those screams the way he used to.<br /><br />While \\"Out of Exile\\" isn't quite up there with such classics as \\"Rage Against The Machine\\" (1992), \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" (1999), \\"Badmotorfinger\\" (1991), or \\"Superunknown\\" (1994), it's still a very strong album.

B00009Z576|4.0|I will admit I'm not a rabid fan of YES. I do enjoy their music, from all eras and all the line ups, but I'm not a fanatic, just a fan. Having said that, I will tell you that I think this IS <br />a YES album, and it does sound like YES. Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman are not the heart and soul of the band, at least not to the point that the band could not continue without them. <br />In it's history YES has had at least two drummers, several keyboard players and guitarists, and two lead singers, but they have had only one bass player. Chris Squire IS the heart and soul of YES and has played in every line-up, on every album. <br />When Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left the band before the recording of DRAMA, many listeners gave the group little or no chance of going on. They were wrong. Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes did an admirable job on this album (and as history shows, on their post-yes projects as well).Maybe they don't sound exactly like Anderson and Wakeman, but one cannot  imagine the three remaining members sitting them down and saying they must try to sound like Anderson and Wakeman. They were allowed to sound like themselves, and YES and DRAMA were the better for it. <br />What I am saying is this: YES was YES before Alan White, Before Steve Howe,before and after Wakeman, and with or without Jon Anderson. As long as the amazingly talented Chris Squire is there, YES will be YES. DRAMA is YES.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|You will wind up talking about this movie.  <br /> <br />What makes Napoleon so great is that I totally can identify with the three characters. I was one of them. Smart and funny, but not accepted, with few friends. Those who hate the movie, or don't find it funny, I wonder what group they belonged to, because I found myself laughing so hard that I remembered what it was like to be in high school, and how mind numbingly cruel the in-crowd can be. The pinata scene is hilarious for one reason, if the beautiful Ms. Wheatley had done it, nothing would have happened to her. Uncle Rico is is a riot with his football and minivan longing for days when he could have been somebody.  <br /> <br />The music, the time machine, even the tupperware...No wonder people don't get the point. No special effects, no over the top moments, no moral pontification. Just Napoleon doing what I wish I had when I ran for Class President...Dance my butt off to a rockin song, and have people cheer you - because you took a stand and stayed true to who you were. There is no better plot point in movies today.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator revisits the epic genre last seen in Ben Hur and in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus. Scott's Gladiator successfully explores the formidable savagery of the Roman gladiator games and the ageless and universal appeal for violence. <br /> <br />Having proven his valiant commitment to Rome, the great General Maximus (Russell Crowe) earns the respect of his army and of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Weakened by a lifetime of war, yet conscientious of the brave and noble nature of his General, the dying Caesar decides to appoint Maximus as his successor and bewilders his ambitious and amoral son Commodus. Before the true successor is officially announced, however, Commodus silences his father's wishes, coerces his observant sister Lucilla, rises to power, and condemns Maximus and his vulnerable family. Escaping death, Maximus is sold into slavery and is trained as a gladiator by Proximo, who knows how to exploit the spectators' thirst for violent entertainment, and who teaches Maximus the importance of winning a crowd. Driven by the mission to avenge Commodus' cruelty and corruption, and guided by his unshakable principles and sense of justice, Maximus is transformed from a slave to a hero. <br /> <br />Gladiator is the product of the carefully choreographed sword fights, of magnificent set design, especially the reconstruction of the Coliseum, accurate costume designs, and weaponry design. Gladiator captures most of its glory in the heroism of its main character Maximus, the General/Gladiator. The character's strength and appeal derives from a well-developed role and from Crowe's accurate personification and skillful performance. <br /> <br />Gladiator, however, owes most of its success to its clever exploration of the notion of \\"spectatorship\\". By providing violent images of the gladiator games, the film portrays the Roman crowd's thirst for violence while simultaneously confronting the film's spectators with their appeal for screen violence. In this manner, Gladiator connects the violence of the arena with the violence of the screen and establishes a common ground between the \\"Roman mob\\" and the \\"movie theater mob\\". Consequently, Gladiator manages to lure the viewer into reacting as the Roman crowd does, ultimately rejecting the villains and sympathizing with the inspiring hero, as the Roman crowd does. All in all, Gladiator is a spectacular film that cleverly uses its poignant images and its powerful characters to create a dramatic story that speaks of the corruptibility of the human mind and the redeeming powers of love and justice.

Obviously, if you are a die-hard DT fan, you already have this.  <br /> <br />But if you are like me, you probably discovered this brilliant band only a few years ago. I got into this band when they released 6DOIT. Awesome album, by the way. But If you are just getting into this band, this DVD set is an excellent place to start. You'll learn a lot of things about this band's history throughout the 90's, like lineup changes, the rigors of touring, and such. Both discs have commentary by the band, which gives further insight into the footage.  <br /> <br />A MUST HAVE FOR ANY DT FANATIC!!!
0792842731|4.0|A ruthless and meglomaniacal media tycoon - comparisons to Rupert Murdoch seem as apt as to Bill Gates - uses his seemingly endless wealth to engineer an Anglo-Sino  war. Though the ambitions of Carver (Jonathan Pryce) seem benign compared to the likes of Hugo Drax, Stromberg or Blofeld (he doesn't want to conquer the world, just the ratings, media and corporate worlds - the worlds that already subjugate the rest of us).  However, Carver's hopes for higher ratings he'd realize on the opening of war between Beijing and London are actually a first step and mask even darker ambitions.  <br /> <br />The sinking of a British warship - apparently by the Chinese - offers hints of Carver's machinations. Unconvinced, British admirals press for immediate retaliation against China. Only the one-time relationship between Carver's wife and agent James Bond offers M (Judi Dench) a way out that doesn't require volleys of cruise missiles.  <br /> <br />Picking up the trail in Germany, Bond finds clues to the extent of Carver's treachery. He also meets up with a wily rival - Michelle Yeoh as high-kicking Chinese agent following the same trail.  <br /> <br />I actually enjoyed \\"Tomorrow\\" better than \\"The World is Not Enough\\" - the direction seems better paced, with action scenes that don't seem to take even the directors by surprise. Too much is kept to the end - like how much fun Jonathan Pryce should have as the baddie (are we supposed to not hate a media bigwig) or how much fun Michelle Yeoh is. As his counterpart, Yeoh is probably the biggest challenge Bond has faced in the d'amour department since Barbara Bach in \\"Spy Who Loved Me\\" (she was the one who wanted to kill him). The plot seems to come together too comfortably otherwise, with the expected showdown in Carver's stealth-catamaran.  Until then, TND tosses in a bullet-proof, remote controlled BMW, a motorcycle and helicopter chase and Michelle Yeoh in a catsuit.  Utterly preposterous, but definitely fun.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I would like to say, just as everyone has said, that Muse is a <br />great band. They were amazing with Showbiz(even if most of you <br />would call it a lame album), they were more amazing with Origin <br />of Symmetry, and now with Absolution, they are so amazing that <br />most of my friends consider their music too sophisticated to  <br />listen to( I agree, but that's probably because the rest of the <br />music nowadays is too simple ). But I would like to say two things: <br />     1. I don't think that it is sensible to put Radiohead down <br />just to prove that Muse is different. Radiohead is simply the  <br />greatest band of the 90s( Nirvana did not last long enough to <br />become the best according to me; of course, they were great too ). Radiohead is probably a more \\"intelligent rock\\" band but <br />Muse expresses the same ideas in a more accessible and musical, <br />rather than experimental, way. <br />     2. The fact that both bands are depressing and really cool <br />to listen to does not mean that they are the same thing. Muse is <br />different with its heavier and more regular beats, with its much <br />more noticeable importance of the presence of the bass( after <br />all they are only three guys, not five like in Radiohead ), and <br />their piano is completely different from Radiohead's piano. Even <br />Showbiz was very different. I can't believe that all of you say <br />that it copied The Bends. <br />        My advice is that all of you buy The Bends( I'm sure many of you have not heard the album ). Radiohead are amazing <br />and Muse are amazing. What should unite the fans of both bands is that they never sound bad( not even a single element of a  <br />song ), they always change and surprise us, and that they are <br />the best proof that good music does not have to necessarily contain  <br />swearing, the repetition of two beats  over and over again and <br />the usage of hip hop elements.
0553260111|5.0|Sometimes, a spy is a good thing to have in the city. In The Bourne Identity, a man named Jason Bourne is always trying to solve the crimes that people do by using DNA. This spy is always trying to help other people that are in trouble or in need of their belongings that were stolen from somebody. <br /> Some shows remind me of this book. Like CSI, they investigate the crimes that other people do and also investigate the things that these people left behind looking for stuff that could identify the person that did it. Furthermore, I think that the people in Zurich, Switzerland are good people to hang out with; but if you have committed a crime, you better watch out. <br /> I love this book because of the action. Like when J. Bourne was shot and police officer pitched in to help the chase of the killers. Also, the investigators investigate the crimes that the bad people do during this century. <br /> I would grade this book as a range of high school reading to collegiate reading. For this book, I think that you have to be very smart to read this book and learn a little French.  <br /> Also, whoever is a rookie detective or spy should read this book, or if you want some excitement to your day. <br /> Jason Bourne also had to deal with a chase of two killers that actually wanted to kill this detective or spy. I don't know why he had to get involved in this case. Nevertheless, I think that Mr. Bourne does a lot of good to his society and to our world. <br /> If you want to know if the killers get caught or not; or if you want to know more about the characters in this book, you better read Book 1 of The Bourne Identity. <br /> <br />  <br />

0316776963|3.0|Looking for an edge away from the \\"same ol' same ol'\\", I picked up this book on a recommendation by a friend.  In reading the first chapter, I was extremely delighted in this non-timeconsuming and simplistically funny book.  However, the further I got into the book, the more abstract the humor was and the harder it was for me to believe the outlandish situations that David Sedaris claims to have experienced.  Though this was not true for every chapter, I found that the far-fetched chapters that slightly pinched a nerve had then made many of the other chapters unbelievable, thus ruining the chance of finding ANY meaning in this book and, instead, making it a book purely for entertainment.  The chapters don't even run together in any plausible and linear format, and instead seem to be formed in the succession of a scattered memory.   <br /> <br />Though I have nothing against books meant for entertainment purposes only, I do not wish to spend much of my time reading them.  Luckily, each chapter contains a short story in itself that could be picked up at any moment I desired.  So, despite my criticism, I did enjoy the book...but only sparingly.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this book is innovative in the way it is written and in it's contents.  However, if you are a fan of philosophy fiction and stories with hidden meanings,  I would recommend this book only if you're the type that needs a complete break once and a while.  Though the book is funny, I would only fully recommend it to those who don't mind spending hours reading scattered stories with no meaning for the lone purpose of being mindlessly entertained.   <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|What is there to say about a woman that has been around for 15 years through heartache, heartbreak, triumph and pain.  This album is slamming. ONE OF HER BEST. I have almost all of her CD's and this is one of the best.  Her range alone speaks volume but her ability to write a song, compose it and produce it speaks higher.  Many are a good singer but few can write and produce.  Her octaves are breath taking and just her confidence in herself is enough. I remember the first day I heard Vision of Love in the early 1990's.  I said who is this singing?  I have been hooked every since. The songs I love are:  We belong together, Circles, It's like that,  Say Somethin (with Snoop), To the Floor (Nelly) and for those who need inspiration she ends it with Fly Like a Bird.  I am a singer and if my career takes off, this is someone I want to mirror.  God bless you Mariah, thanks for sharing your gift of song with us.  Thanks to the good Lord above for blessing her with the gift of song.  READERS go and buy it.  One of the best albums for 2005.  Tee

Starting with its debut-week numbers of over 400,000 copies, the biggest debut week of her career.  As of this week, she earned her 16th #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"We Belong Together.\\"  The only artists who have more number one hits than she does are The Beatles (20 #1s) and Elvis (18 #1s).  Congrats to my girl....MARIAH CAREY! <br /> <br />This album is overall a very great one.  Not her best (my personal favorite is 1997's \\"Butterfly\\"), but still spectacular.  You'd think that having four guest-spots on the album, that the guest-spot songs would be the best; WRONG!  Actually, the solo numbers are really where Mariah shines.  Highlights (my favorites) here are: \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Shake It Off,\\" \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Say Somethin' (feat. Snoop Dogg), \\"Stay The Night,\\" \\"Circles,\\" \\"To The Floor (feat. Nelly),\\" and \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\" <br /> <br />The best slow jam here is \\"Mine Again.\\"  This ballad really exhibits Mariah's vocals.  I must say, she doesn't sing nearly as well as she once did, but she's still a terrific vocalist.  People might say that she can't sing because she doesn't sound anywhere near as good as she once was, but she can still sing.  \\"Mine Again\\" proves so. <br /> <br />\\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" speak for themselves.  They're the first two singles from the album, and great ones as expected.  At top 5 favorite here is the Gospel number, \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\"  I love Gospel music.  Artists like Kirk Franklin, the Winans family, Mary Mary, Fred Hammond are what I grew up on.  This is a great Gospel/inspirational song.  Mariah pours her soul and emotion into this one. <br /> <br />The best featured-guest songs here are \\"To The Floor\\" with Nelly, and \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop Dogg.  Either will make for a blazin' single.  Another great ballad on this CD is \\"Circles.\\"  It has an ol' skool feel to it (I purposely misspelled). <br /> <br />The remainings of the album aren't what you'd call filler, they just aren't standouts.  With that said, I'll only rate my favorites: (*denotes best of the best) <br /> <br />\\"It's Like That\\" - 5/5* <br /> <br />\\"We Belong Together\\" - 5/5* <br /> <br />\\"Shake It Off\\" - 5/5* <br /> <br />\\"Mine Again\\" - 5/5* <br /> <br />\\"Say Somethin'\\" (f/Snoop Dogg) - 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Stay The Night\\" - 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Circles\\" - 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"To The Floor\\" (f/Nelly) - 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Fly Like A Bird\\" - 5/5* <br /> <br /> <br />Any true Mariah Carey fan, or R&B/Hip-Hop music fan, should have this in their CD changer.
B0002S94OS|5.0|it rips your freakin' ears from your head! After the re-attachment of the east west iPod fillers (so carefully completed by Dr. Kovorkian!), this recording flourishes as Randy, Chris, Will, Mark and John pound the hairs under your flesh up and out. Holy Crap! On my 1 hour trek to work, I CONSTANTLY get reactions from those on the NJ Turnpike and Major Deegan, all cultures, with the look of FEAR and disgust as I BLAST the cd. I just love the way the cd opens as Laid to Rest begins. The tune that gets me in trouble as I drive (not one accident yet!) is Hourglass, when the song breaks when either Will or Mark rips that solo! I know all of you try to move your fingers with your air guitar trying to keep up. I do! The whole cd is tight. I had reservations about the cd because they signed to a major label with Epic. When a really good band signs with major labels, stuff like the heavyness, production, musicianship is watered down. Not here. It's like Prosthetic Records hit the lottery and bought new equipment! The sound quality got better, music got Heavier!, Chris' pounding is TIGHT!, and you can actually hear John on the Bass thundering through! And Randy. What else needs to be said about Randy. One of the best throats in the industry (IMO). For those of you contemplating, pick this up. You will not regret it! Peace.
B000929AJQ|3.0|the album itself is good. anything else coming out these days almost definetely cannot match this. However, we've been waiting for around 6 years, and I don't know about you, but to me, this is no downward spiral. I know that may have been NIN's prime, and its unfair to compare this strictly to the one cd. but after waiting 6 years, i must say i am rather dissapointed. However, for a person just looking for good music, you definetely need this cd. for those looking to get into NIN, i suggest buying The Downward Spiral and The Fragile beforehand. <br /> <br />
B000003BEV|4.0|Difficult to assimilate even after a few plays, \\"Satantic Majesties\\" is still a colorful, lazy-chaotic mess with blissfully stoned moments of sad, fake-merriment. \\"Citadel\\" is a tough, jangling rocker, \\"In Another Land\\" is almost a ballad(and a beautiful one)with psychedelic flourishes, \\"2000 Man\\" is a great stone-out, and \\"On With The Show\\" is an amusing musical swipe at the Beatles. The opener, \\"Sing This All Together\\", is a kicky pop-wannabe, but the jam session reprise is an obvious time-filler. Thankfully, \\"She's a Rainbow\\" saves the second volley, and is a majestic pop masterwork. Nothing else on \\"Majesties\\" is quite as captivating or as memorable as \\"Rainbow\\", but the opening songs are well worth hearing and feature some incredible orchestration.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a brilliant satire that plays out like an old war sitcom, such as Hogan's Heroes or M*A*S*H*.  The story takes place in an airbase, on a small island off the cost of Italy, during the end of World War II.  The sitcom feel comes from the over twenty central characters, each with their own different fears, ambitions, passions, personalities, goals and beliefs.  Not to mention each character is INSANE in his own personal way.  From the rebellious Yosarrian, who believes everybody is out to kill him, to the capitalistic Milo, who bombs the base himself as a business investment, the misadventures that occur on the island when all these characters try to survive with one another bestows upon the story its sitcom-like charm.   <br />  <br />The author, Joseph Heller, uses elements such as dark humor, explicit violence, and everything in between to craft this novel.  By making you laugh out loud on one page, and then sicken you with disgust on the next, Heller demonstrates the utter insanity of war.  He blatantly accuses the government and the military of turning their back on the innocent men they USED to do their dirty work.  The generals in Catch-22 are portrayed as irrational, ignorant, and power hungry because they are more concerned with the prestige they may receive than the number of men they pointlessly send to their death. <br />  <br />On the whole I would recommend this book because of its ability to be humorous, appalling, and thought provoking all at the same time.  By the end, the reader begins to understand the hopelessness of all the characters because they are not evil men, but the war forces them to choose between doing evil and being killed.  <br />
1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is a tale of one man's path to redefining his life after his girlfriend leaves him.  He then traces back through all his past relationships making a list of his top 5 worst breakups.  Rob then comes to terms with who he is and considers a career change.  In the end he gets back together with Laura and starts his DJ career up again.  I found this book to be a great read and anybody who likes music would appreciate it, especially those aware of the indie snobs in the world.  The character Barry hits the nail on the head.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|Marc Forster's FINDING NEVERLAND isn't a bad movie, I suppose. In its depiction of playwright J.M. Barrie's creation of the classic PETER PAN, it has its occasional moments of real wide-eyed wonder (mostly during re-enactments of moments in the actual play), and it has generally fine performances from its cast---not even the prestige-pic atmosphere of this movie can keep the wide-ranging actor Johnny Depp down. And, of course, the movie looks sumptuous and handsome (which counts for something in my book).    But FINDING NEVERLAND is yet another example of the kind of sentimental, non-threatening tripe that Hollywood has a tendency to produce and foist upon the masses during Oscar season. This particular Oscar-bait picture has as its mantra \\"Just believe,\\" but the movie rarely ever elicits the same sense of innocent wonder that this film's Barrie clearly believes in. (Its brief \\"fantasy\\" sequences---which includes Barrie dancing with a dog, or Barrie playing a pirate with a widower's kids---are too cheesily done to make us believe in anything.) Nor does it have much of a sharp edge to its potentially disturbing depiction of a writer's sudden fixation on the widower's kids; his attraction to the innocence of these kids---at least, in most of the kids; one of them, played by Freddie Highmore, still carries the pain and anger of loss with him---is depicted (and romanticized) by Forster and screenwriter David Magee as mostly pure and rather beautiful. (Yea right; so is Michael Jackson's, too?) By smoothing away almost all of the rough edges, by manipulating events to fit its banal message, by toning down Johnny Depp's usual actorly exuberance, Marc Forster comes up with a film that, for all its impressive production values, is never very intellectually stimulating. It's insufferably pleasant rather than challenging. Is it deeply moving? For me, not really; when Forster finally unveils his visual depiction of Neverland towards the end, it is mawkish rather than transporting; so is its final scene, in which Barrie tells disillusioned young Peter Davies to \\"just believe\\" that his relatives still live on.     Look, it's a nice idea, to be able to hold on to your child-like innocence and all that. But, just because you become an adult, that doesn't mean you have to lose your imagination or sense of child-like wonder. (That's one of the things movies can do best---but not this movie.) But it's hardly a good idea either to be as child-like as this film's Barrie is; in this difficult world, you'd never survive if your only purpose in life was to remain an innocent child throughout, the way Barrie tries to be. Growing up is something everybody has to do; it's something FINDING NEVERLAND apparently doesn't believe in. It's better to remain a naive kid rather than live in the real world. And of course this potentially dangerous philosophy gets applause from gullible viewers who find the movie \\"enchanting\\": it's a fantasy that appeals to them, which is precisely why I think the film is intellectually empty. Sorry if that sounds terribly cynical, but that personal reaction to the film's message is the only way I can explain why there was only one scene in the movie that genuinely moved me: a scene in which an angry Peter Davies shouts out to Barrie, \\"I will not be lied to.\\" It's the only scene with any real dramatic weight to it, because it is the closest the movie comes to challenging its own sentimental, simple-minded \\"just believe\\" philosophy. Peter has glimpsed the cold, hard reality of death, and is trying to deal with it in his own way; this film's Barrie, instead, would probably try to tell himself that no one ever really dies, as long as his/her memory is kept alive. Again, a comforting notion; but it can be plain delusional to deny the harsh reality of death.    FINDING NEVERLAND is well-made enough that it's worth the 3 stars I'm granting it here. The movie probably makes worthy family entertainment; there's nothing all that offensivefor parents to get too worried about. But if you're expecting something truly insightful or deeply moving from this trite Hollywood prestige pic, you might be disappointed. For all of its adult pretensions, FINDING NEVERLAND is, at heart, as childish as its real-life hero.

B0002CTSW2|2.0|I found the main character in this movie very difficult to believe. He is supposedly imbued with superhuman powers, given to him by his deity father. However, when faced with persecution by the Romans the guy just sits back and takes it!<br />It is hard to find any verisimilitude in a \\"god-like\\" figure who can't do a thing to protect himself from a bunch of soldiers armed only with swords and whips.<br />A friend of mind who is really into Christianity explained to me that Jesus let them torture and kill him so that all his followers would be absolved of their sins and saved  whatever that means. What a joke!! If the guy had all these fantastic powers it would only make sense that he stop the evil guys (Romans) and then absolve all of his followers sins after the fact.<br />I don't think this movie even tries to look at any of the incongruities of the source material. My theory is this Jesus guy was a total fraud. He claims to be the son of God so he can meet girls and start a big movement (based on himself) by telling everyone he's the son of God. He claims that he's done all these \\"miracles\\" but when it's time to pull a miracle out his sleeve and save his own skin, he conveniently just sits back and says he is doing it for the good of everyone else. Give me a break!<br />If this guy was such a saviour to the earth he would have done a heck of a lot more to clean up the mess that was going on in that part of the world at the time and quit trying to self-promote himself as some sort of messianic figure. The whole story about the guys life sounds absurd and contrived. I can't believe people are still buying this tripe, 2000 years on.
B00008OLYN|3.0|Good music, but really boring. Intresting CD but really repetitive. <br />Try it only if you're a fan...if not, try the oldies.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I know that im not in the band- but they need to wake up- and go back to their roots- they are getting worse and worse
B00005176F|3.0|I'm not a huge die hard blur fan, but I like some of the hits that made airplay in the US (though Song 2 isn't the best IMO). But, man, a couple of the tunes that don't have a whole lot more to say than a three minute pop song should hang around for twice that long (beetlebum, for tomorrow, tender - just goes on and on and on). Harmless tunes in and of themselves but stretched out as if it's pure gold that they just didn't have the heart to end. Boys, it's not THAT great. A lot of these Brit Boy Bands take themselves way too seriously (cough... oasis). Parklife is my favorite and weighs in at a reasonable 3:07.  <br /> <br />Maybe take a cue from Supergrass and keep'em short or make them interesting for the entire ride if you've just got to go past 4:00.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This film took me by surprise. My girlfriend rented it and we sat down to watch it, i wasnt expecting to much. But from start to finish this film is nothing short of breathtaking. The acting in this movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, the script writing is amazing as well as the music. Daniel Day Lewis who plays \\"the butcher\\" is by far in my opinion the best villain of all time. His acting in this movie is BRILLIANT! Even his costume is awesome, he just looks cool. To me this movie is one of my favorites of all time, and if i were you i would go and see this!!
B000001GPX|5.0|Wonderful Music <br />Beautifully performed <br />Excellent recording <br />And masterful remastering <br /> <br />If I had to narrow my (considerable) collection to one CD only - I would have had no hesitations...
B00005JNTX|5.0|I could go on and on and tell you the 10 billion reasons why this is one of the best films i have ever watched, but everyone else has already done that. The fact is, this movie ROCKS, i could watch it time and time again and never get tired. So simply go out and see this movie and enjoy the visual masterpiece. The music is also amazing. SEE THIS FILM!
B00029LNHS|5.0|Elephunk is one of the most energetic and awesome albums ever! All the songs will make you get up and dance. It's not your ordinary hip-hop/rap album! The Black Eyed Peas have their own type of music. \\"Hey Mama!\\" and \\"Shut Up\\" are my two favorite songs on the album! They carry great beats with awesome lyrics that MAKE you get up and dance. \\"Elephunk\\" is certainly a great attribute to the music today, and I can't wait until \\"Monkey Business\\" comes out! I've already pre-ordered it on iTunes! If you're a person who likes to get up and just dance to a cool beat, this CD for you. Even if you don't like to dance, this is a great CD to listen to. I would definitely buy this album if I didn't already have it!
B0007OASII|5.0|I just recently started listening to \\"power metal\\" and ordered this CD blind through amazon's recommendations and I sure am glad I did.  This record is incredible.  I think it is very unique.  I really haven't heard anything like it.  Sure there are 'similar' bands, but Kahn's voice really sets them apart.  He has a voice that could cross over into different genres (luckily he doesn't) and he'd have a good shot at winning American Idol (not that I watch that show, I'm just trying to explain!). <br />This is definatly a must have for anyone who is interested in any sub-genre of metal.   <br />
B00080ZG10|5.0|Very good movie about Howard Hughes directed in a big Hollywood style way. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B000099T2L|1.0|I know there are a lot of major Beyonce fans out there and the last thing I would want to do is anger all of you, but I must be honest in saying that this album and Beyonce's overall presentation echoes glorified prostitution.  Her songs on this album have ABSOLUTELY no substance, just about having sex (which is something that children definitely DO NOT need to hear).  You might think it's just a dance album, but just listen carefully to the lyrics of her songs (ex: Crazy In Love, Naughty Girl).  The only songs that have true substance and meaning were the ones she chose to remake.  Don't get me wrong, I am no hater.  But when I see a beautiful, somewhat talented young women just shaking and dancing in next to nothing, it is such a waste.  Just think for a moment, hypothetically, if Beyonce reached 50 years old and gained 100+ pounds, are you really going to want to see her perform \\"Crazy in Love.\\"  It will lose all its momentum. <br /> <br />Beyonce can make music without exposing herself.  She needs to go with a more elegant and classy approach, instead of sheer raunchiness.  With more vocal training and a better song selection, Beyonce might just stand right up there with Billie Holliday and Aretha Franklin as a woman known for her voice instead of slut appeal.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Infinite distance of an inch could be unbearable when one does not have the ability to provide in any form for anyone.  A mere inch might as well be in a different continent much like an endless long-distance relationship.  The difficulty of reaching for the inch results from the inability of sending signals from the from brain through the spinal cord to the motor neurons that control muscular contraction that creates movement through a number of complex levers generated through the muscles and bones.  Also, no stimulus can return to the brain that would be perceived as touch, warmth, and pain.  Thus, there is no way for a quadriplegic to openly express their thoughts through actions, as actions bear more depth than meager words.  In the Sea Inside the protagonist Ram&oacute;n Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has suffered from this sad disability for more than a quarter of a century, as he only can move his facial muscles.<br /><br />\\"Relax...\\" is the first word of the film, which sets an ironic tone due to Ram&oacute;n's disability.  However, the word's purpose is of serenity, as the voice of Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), tries to induce mental state that can help Ram&oacute;n dream and imagine of how life could have been if he never were injured.  This scene illustrates the power of the mind, as Ram&oacute;n drifts into his personal paradise where the waves of the ocean brush the perfect beach while the water gently sweeps over his feet during his walk.  His stroll along the beach provides an opportunity for him to feel the warm wind run between his fingers and against his skin.  Everything is perfect, until reality returns in form of a thunderstorm outside.  Only the mind can create these sensations in artificial manners such as dreaming.  In reality, Ram&oacute;n needs help with basic needs such as sleep, food, water, and toilet visits which requires continuous loyal support.  For example, someone must turn him or he will most likely suffer a bed soars that could give him an infection.  His lives a life with constant distance where privacy does no longer exists, as time simply passes before him.<br /><br />Over time Ram&oacute;n has learned that crying does not sooth his pain within, as he must rely on others.  As a result, Ram&oacute;n smiles whenever he cries, and he does a lot of smiling throughout the film.  When Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda), a lawyer that will help Ram&oacute;n to achieve his ultimate goal in life, which is to end his life asks the question why he desires to die Ram&oacute;n replies that he wants to die because his life offers him no dignity.  However, in order to help push through a law that could help euthanasia for Ram&oacute;n, she must dig deeper into his psyche and his identity.  Through the portrayal of Ram&oacute;n the audience learns that he was an active person who loved his freedom while traveling the world.  His dreams of the ocean and being able to fly enhances his desire for freedom, which he cannot obtain.<br /><br />The film continues to propose notions about love, freedom, death, and life.  Rosa (Lola Due&ntilde;as), a factory worker and radio host, becomes heavily involved with Ram&oacute;n, but through her fear of loosing him she persists to keep him alive.  Instead of being loving and accepting the others wishes, she becomes selfish and through her selfishness Ram&oacute;n remains a prisoner to life.  Ram&oacute;n has a similar relationship to his brother.  There is also an interesting scene in the film is when a quadriplegic priest visits Ram&oacute;n and tries to convince him that life is worth living.  Throughout the discussion between the two men the priests says, \\"Freedom without a life is not freedom.\\"  Ram&oacute;n counters with \\"A life without freedom is not a life.\\"  This might sound slightly arrogant by Ram&oacute;n, but he also does not judge others, as he simply wants to live with dignity.  These ideas and many others offer a poignant solution to what he wants and what others want,which offers much to ponder.<br /><br />Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar directs an absolutely amazing film that brings the audience a taboo topic up close and personal.  Previously, Amen&aacute;bar has directed terrific films such as the frightful Thesis (1996) and brilliant visual maze Open Your Eyes (1997).  This time he continues to show improvement in his skills as a filmmaker, as many viewers will probably see much more from this up and coming director.  The Sea Inside covers almost every possible angel that relies on a great script, which keeps the audience engrossed in the cinematic experience.  The meticulous camerawork captures every detail of the astounding mise-en-scene.  This enhances the artistic and visual experience.  Lastly, the terrific cast around Javier Bardem helps augment his stellar performance, as it will leave many viewers in deep contemplation in regards to its theme.pic up close and personal.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Major league letdown of the comic book Hellblazer lacks the drama and horror of that book and put in a dumb sense of humor that not only does not fly but has a leading man that does not do his character any justice at all. I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on Keanu Reeves because I think he has a certain charm to him but I have to agree with the majority that he is miscast in the role of John Constantine. He does not come across well and his brooding streak does not fit the character at all. He acts more like Batman than the charming and humorous John Constantine of the comic books and the performance he gives is not very good at all because of it. The story is not very compelling at all and it feels like it was rush into production with out a single rewrite to put things in order because everything feels like it has no structure at all. The special effects also feel rushed and certain scenes actually feel awkward because of the direction, which is not bad but could have been more original than it was. The ending of the film contradicts the beginning and the plot lines concerning certain characters especially John Constantine himself doesn't really fit the movie at all. The only thing that worked in this film is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which not only kept the movie from spiraling into its own vat of stupidity but also made the movie a lot more compelling than it really was.  Weisz gave this movie more dignity and substance than it deserved and her performance really does deserve a better movie than this because it's the only real thing about the entire film. You actually believe in her character and her struggles with her own faith while you don't buy the story that she is stuck in.  Rachel Weisz truly deserves all the praise she has garnered for this film and our sympathy as well for being the only good thing about it.  <br /> <br />I don't know what went wrong here but it's not a good adaptation of the comic book and it that's a major crime because the comic book is so much better than what this film was. <br />
B000957O82|4.0|Cupid flutters around spreading happiness with his arrows of love and affection.  These arrows strike each target with one single attempt, as the person falls in love after the single moment when the arrow strikes them.  Love changes everything, as it means commitment, trust, and mutual affection when the love is answered.  Hitch (Will Smith) is the human cupid, as he works his magic as a partner consultant that helps men get noticed by the woman who is the target of their love.  Everything around Hitch oozes of class as nothing is cheesy, cheap, or corrupt. He is a true gentleman that helps others find their opportunity with love by shooting his arrows of affection.<br /><br />Hitch ended up becoming a love consultant due to an incident in college when he suffered from a broken heart.  Now he focuses on helping guys like he once was, as he helps them strategize their upcoming encounters and dates.  Carefully Hitch helps the men with how to approach the women, what to say, and how they must behave around the woman they love.  Everything is thoroughly planned, as it all comes down to one moment - the first kiss.<br /><br />When Hitch meets his freshest client Albert (Kevin James) he senses a disaster.  The problems increase when he finds out that Albert loves Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a famous and incredibly rich woman.  Nonetheless, Hitch believes that he can pull it off by creating a masterpiece.  Simultaneously, he meets Sara (Eva Mendes), a relentless gossip columnist, with whom he falls in love.  This affair turns into a greater mess than expected for Hitch who finds himself kicking women, having severe food allergies, while Sara finds it difficult to combine personal life and professional life.<br /><br />Hitch is a warm comedy about love, affection, and the connection between people.  Will Smith is perfect for the role as Hitch, as he easily drifts into the gentle and cool character.  His performance is well balanced with the supporting cast, and Kevin James complements Will Smith by making the two look like contemporary Laurel and Hardy.

B000002V1D|5.0|This cd for me falls into the catagory of \\"I would never want to lose this cd, and if I do, it will be replaced ASAP!\\" <br /> <br />This Duran Duran album is a classic IMO. Ranks only second to my beloved Notorious album, but Wedding Album contains some rocking rocking tracks! <br />The way Duran Duran fused some new electronica sounds (like Come Undone, and Love Voodoo) with more acoustic-sounding tracks (like Ordinary World) is just a testament to their genius and cool music sense! <br /> <br />My track favorites are-Too Much Information (heavy on drums and guitar, very cool \\"harder\\" Duran!) Very fun driving song! <br />-Ordinary World..needs no explanation..just a real hot track..very somber, but also uplifting at the same time! Classic <br />-Love Voodoo-actually is one of the top 2 non single tracks for me. Very powerful and slinky...\\"Night after night I try to prove..that I can resist you\\"...very sexy! Very 'Come Undone' ish in production ... LOVE THIS SONG!  <br />-Come Undone-classic DD! Great performed live in concert too <br />-None of the Above-Definitely a great Duran track..one of my favorite songs of all time! Cool fusing of electronica sounds and kind of acoustic guitar sounds! GREAT gem on this cd! <br /> <br />I also agree that this cd is an underrated gem from the '90's and an unbelievable DD cd!
B000002GYI|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard \\"Computer love\\"I was walkind down canal street with my brother in 81 and we were carrying his JVC very large boom box and he says\\"listen to this song. I think if they ever made The Omega Man part 2 it would be perfect for it so he puts in the tape and presses play and then those first 9 keys come on full blast and were walking between a side street and the sound is echoing between the buildings and im just like \\"this is the greatest thing ive ever heard\\" and it just keeps going and were both just in another world and because of that intro to Computer World Computer love has become my favorite song of all time.This is a Monster of a album it really doesnt get any better.I once listened to Computer love 8.5 hours in a row.And yes Kraftwerk is playing the Greek theatre on june 6th 05 and already got my tickets and i just cant wait to be in the presence of \\"true Greatness\\". Buy this cd you wont be sorry.Im a Dj and know my stuff just remember DJC rocks the mic so viciously and thats the way it is HU!
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I think that this is arguably Adams' most solid and consistent record yet. I've loved all of his records, but let's admit it, even the best of them are uneven. \\"Heartbreaker\\", for all of its greatness, gets bogged down in places with its meandering acoustic numbers. Although a more solid record, \\"Gold\\" sags here and there. \\"Demolition\\", strangely enough, is a pretty solid collection, but still has the feel of a demo collection. And I could go on. <br /> <br />Another thing that people seem to complain about is Adams' style changing, but this has never bothered me. For some reason, it didn't seem strange to me that he would make a rock n roll record. Where he succeeds with the style changes is in the fact that (\\"Demolition\\" aside) he is consistent within each record. All of \\"Gold\\" had the same feel, all of \\"Love is Hell\\" had the same feel. And now, here is a rock-solid country-ish collection from him. <br /> <br />I'm not saying this is his best, I'm just saying that it feels like more of a complete work than any of the rest of his albums have. It feels like he had one creative vision and followed it through front to back. <br /> <br />The packaging alone is worth the four stars. <br /> <br />Buy this record.
B000002INR|5.0|I can always go back to this album and rock out! You can play air guitar and drums to this album for years and then some! A must have for 80's hair/hard rock fans. Rock on Skid Kids!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Loved by some metal fans and hated by prog fans. Strange Evolution no?? (if this can be called evolution) Actually I like this, it has one or two good tracks, but but... this album as a whole entity is nothing, its just music well played (excersise instructions r not?) but it has nothing to say, besides it has a dirty sound nothing to do compared with the previous ones. After SDOIT (which i love) i thought they were going to follow that rout, instead they were for the metal rout but without sense. Other thing that i didn't like about this albumis that JORDAN RUDESS didn`t on this one... ah ah.. Did he play her??? ahh ok did he do it like a guess?? no no... PETRUCCI & PORTNOY didn't give any chance to him to get involved in it... what a waste of such a musician!!!. As i said, there are some good track, ENDLESS SACRIFICE has some SFAM feeling some good changes, some RUDESS touches, well... a good, STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS is the best track, well structured, a good progressive aproach, (well, progressive is too much for this album!!!). Other thing that i missed was a \\"grand finale\\", like learning to live, finally free... you know. IN THE NAME OF GOD is an goodok song but it doesn't have the DT magic, it has some feeling but... nt enough for DT. Well, i hope a next try but more progressive otherwise... they will be pulling under my faith on them.
B00006LI4S|4.0|Forget any of the bad reviews. The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 was because I didn't want it to end!!!! <br />  I loved every second of it... I will admit the fact that the 2 guest singers read off of a piece of paper. Other then that I could not get enough. I've been listening to Floyd since about 1978 and love Gilmour's guitar. His guitar, his vocals and the song list are just incredible. <br />  After reading some of the other reviews I was a bit worried about what this might be like and I will tell you I am very glad I bought this. The \\"spare digits\\" feature alone was worth my money.. it was the first part I viewed... but once I watched the whole thing I couldn't wait to write this review to say..... <br /> <br />... if you don't like this then you just don't understand!! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|OK, call me a stickler for details, but it's not my fault I've actually read the Illiad and the Odyssey.  How could the producer reduce this epic that lasted 10 years to a series of battles lasting just 4 days???  I am OK with poetic licence, but this is pushing it a bit.  There is no explanation about the horse or where it came from (actually, it was Odysseus' idea) and the killing of the bad guys in the end is just stupid and is simply there to conform to Hollywood's mania about justice at all costs - the good ones always win and the bad guys die.  Ridiculous, just ridiculous...

B0000CDLA7|1.0|Unfortunately, a very disappointing album which gives a clear indication of Dream Theaters decline artistically. Not being content with having given us the studio-improvised pretentiousness of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Dream Theater, five professional musicians in their 30s and 40s, want to become angsty, heavy and dark. Unfortunately, they stopped being young and angry 20 years ago, and the result is laughably bad, devoid of any impact whatsoever. Solos are abundant, with clean precise picking and fast runs, but this listener feels nothing when he hears Dream Theaters studio indulgences and empty virtuosity. There is also little magic to be found in the harmonic minor heavy metal riffs John Petrucci churns out on his seven-string guitar, all following the same basic patterns of root note-transition-root note, often throwing in a bar or two in odd time signatures (so it can classify as \\"prog\\", like that should matter). <br /> <br />All that was magical about Dream Theater has vanished, a development starting with the appointment of Jordan Rudess as keyboardist. With this man behind the 'boards, all sense of restraint vanished and those that had given us such brilliant albums like Falling Into Infinity and Images and Words now went fully professional and started composing in the studio, instead of honing their compositions to the max in rehearsals. Train of Thought is clear evidence that DT are now releasing albums for the sake of releasing them, and is so mediocre that it marks the first album by said group that I have not, and will not, purchase.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Most of the reviews on here are totally nonsensical. I hear much complaining about many of the elements that make Dream Theater progressive. Just because you don't like how it sounds, doesn't mean its bad. I don't like James LaBrie's rap renditions. And I don't like the gated/muted shouting either. I also don't like the unstructured progression of Stream of Consciousness- it gells much too much like The Dance of Eternity. Wanna hear a good improv jam? Check out Bombay Vindaloo.  <br /> <br />This doesn't mean its bad music though. Most people forget that speed, tempo, and trills are just as essential to music and the creation of mood and emotion as any other aspect of songwriting. Just because YOU don't like it, doesn't mean it should be dismissed. <br /> <br />I actually find Endless Sacrifice and Vacant to be a pleasant break from the non- commercial side of Dream Theater. Endless Sacrifice has a good commercial groove to it that will suddenly fool the listener as soon as they break into the solo. And the coda to ES, as much as some might want to write it off as 'Metallica', is so much more complex in notation and fingering than typical Metallica pick chords as fast as you can music. The two are totally incomparable. <br /> <br />In the name of God reminds me a lot of Learning to Live in its structure and its good to hear DT still can create some tasteful epic songs. <br /> <br />This is not DT's best effort, but certainly worth a listen or two. <br /> <br />I would really like to see DT spread their progressive wings and maybe ditch LaBrie for an album...how about a female singer in the likes of Amy Lee from Evanescence. Or Ray Alder from Fates Warning. LaBrie is a great singer technically, but the timbre of his voice isn't so great outside of the 800-1000Hz range. The smooth, soaring vocals like that found in Images and Words are his forte. <br /> <br />I would also like to see DT branch into a instrumental album exploring jazz, blues, classical, and experimental (like Mahavishnu orchestra type stuff).
0393314804|4.0|Like many people, I read \\"Trainspotting\\" after seeing the eponymous film.  The movie was just a great ride and the book was too.  The book, however, was darker and more nihilistic.  The humour blacker and landscape even bleaker.<br /><br />The essence of \\"Trainspotting\\" is a series of events revolving around the main character, Mark Renton, and his drug addicted mates.  It is set against the backdrop of Edinburgh and its working class slums where work is resisted and drugs are accepted as part of day to day life.<br /><br />The language of the book is coarse yet plausible.  The jargon and argot of the junkie weaves its way through out the book.  As for the dialogue and grammar, this is the rough brogue of the streets.  At first, this is difficult to grasp but after a few pages, it gradually makes sense and becomes more familiar.  It is like a twentieth century and bastardised version of what Mark Twain was trying to do with Huckleberry Finn.<br /><br />\\"Trainspotting\\" is not a book to be read by the easily shocked or the self-righteous moraliser.  It is a book that confronts our sensibilities as it slowly draws us into another world.  The scenes often make the reader cringe but there is always something within the characters and the settings that acts to mesmerise.  This is a book that acts like a flame to the moth.  Its attraction is over powering.  Take a gulp of air and be truly challenged.  Read the book!
B00005RZV4|5.0|If you haven't seen Nine Inch Nails live, you really don't know what you're missing, but this record can help fill in the gaps.    One thing immediately noticable about the show is that the level of energy is enormous-- having seen several incarnations of live Nine Inch Nails one thing that's consistently true is that the band always seems to be primed to explode.  On this tour (and record), its further accentuated by moments of calm between pieces such as a fantastic extended \\"The Frail\\" (pity the crowd couldn't keep quiet during it).  But the highlight is the high energy pieces-- opener \\"Terrible Lie\\", \\"March of the Pigs\\" and \\"Wish\\" are all dynamic and powerful.  Its also a nice mix of material, with six songs from the then most recent album (\\"The Fragile\\"), four from \\"The Downward Spiral\\", and three each from \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"Broken\\".    For those interested, the sound quality is superb-- crisp, clean, and loud.    If you can dig it up, you might want to check out the two disc version, which features several songs new and old recorded in stripped down arrangements.    Either way, this is a great set, highly recommended.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I love this CD.  My husband and I have been waiting for this CD since the first one came out.  I was a bit worried because there is such statistical bad luck for groups formed from prior supergroups.  Love Soundgarden and Love the RATM songs I have heard, but Audioslave is awesome!  I know most good things always come to an end but I hope to see Audioslave rock on as long as the Stones have.  Chris Cornell has a beautiful voice and the guitar, bass, and drums are just as rivaling.  This is a CD that I truly listen to each song; the words, the sounds of the instruments - without skipping over any one song as you do on so many other CDS.  There is not one song where I feel like, wow, could have done without this track. They are all separate yet blend together as a work of art. In Music these days with all of the Britney Spears and artists that all sound alike, or oops, I did a movie, maybe now I can put out a record now too, or worse yet a reality TV Show.  I also attended Audioslave's concert in Chicago April 22nd at the Aragon, it was also incredible.  Chris and the band offered a variety of Audioslave, Former Acoustic Soundgarden, and RATM.  Audioslave did not play a lot of their new tunes since the album had not debuted yet other than a couple of singles like Be Yourself,,I think this was genius for them to come out and tour just before their 2nd album came out. What a great thing to get all of their base fans from Soundgarden, RATM, and the First Audioslave excited and come out and see them so that you were just panting to go out there and listen to the new CD a month later.  While I too enjoy Chris's solo voice (Euphoria Morning)...this group of men seems like true music artists, not willing to put out an album until it feels right for them artistically, they seem genuinely grateful and down to earth for their fans...I guess what I want to say is that I hope they stay together for a very long time because each of these members is incredibly talented.  On the album cover insert, Chris and the band members thank special people in their life and at the end thank \\"you\\", the audioslave fans.  In this day of music crap (worse than the 80's glam rock and metal), it is truly me THANKING AUDIOSLAVE.  This album has been in my CD player nonstop since its' release.  There is no other band out there right now that can compare.  Again, THANKYOU AUDIOSLAVE!  May you all be blessed and especially thanks for tracks 2, 4, 10, 11, and 12!!!!
B0007WZUMO|3.0|When \\"With Teeth\\" first came out, I wrote a highly critical review of it, which I stand by.  I won't bore with a repeat of that review, but I'll summarize and add a few further thoughts before delving into why I found the Japanese issue quite a bit more rewarding. <br /> <br />I've had a chance recently to listen to \\"With Teeth\\" in context of the rest of Reznor's output, and while it bears out my original assessment of the record, I missed a critical detail-- essentially I viewed \\"The Fragile\\" as a somewhat bipolar album, much of it was verse-chorus soft/loud structured songs, and the rest of it was largely experimental pieces with sparse and often unique instrumental arrangements.  Its the former material that led to this album, which is largely an exploration of pop forms in the context of Nine Inch Nails' vocabulary, but my main complaint is that it covers very little new ground, the exception being the broaching of an odd funk sensibility on the album-- check out opener \\"All the Love in the World\\" and \\"Sunspots\\" for this. <br /> <br />The Japanese edition comes with a trio of bonus tracks that lead me to believe it may have largely been material and arrangement selection that caused \\"With Teeth\\" to be so weak.  Ignoring the remix of \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", the other two tracks are fantastic-- \\"Home\\", similar in vein to the better material on the album but with a more unique arrangement would have been one of the standouts had it been included on the record.  The v2 remix of \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" peels back the arrangement and increases the piece's effectiveness. <br /> <br />My advice-- get this edition, the bonus tracks won't disappoint (although the amazon price seems rather high....), and it augments the album nicely.
B00000IP4H|5.0|testament turns death metal with this release. the first 3 songs really kick some ass, also check out murky waters.
1400032717|5.0|The story, simple yet original, is told with a heartbreaking honesty unique to the autistic.  It was easy for me to be drawn in and forget, which reading, that this was a fiction.  The main character is not always easy to like, and accompanying him through his adventure is often frustrating and emotionally draining, but leaves you with a great sympathy for him and for those who care for him.  I've recommended this book to all my family and friends.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I absolutly love this musical! I went to block buster one day in search of a different musical, but no luck. So I said \\"well, I've wanted to see CATS for a while\\" so I rented that instead, and I'm glad I did! So I watched it for the first time and it was nothing I thought it would be. So then I watched it once more... Thats when I fell in love with it! Well, rental time was up and out of the seven days I had it, I watched it twenty-two times! Well, I rented it again and then I got up to fourty-six times. Then I bought it off of E-bay a few days ago, and I have watched it fourty-nine times in all. You may think I'm obbsessed... BUT I'M NOT!!!!!!! I recomend this wonderful musical to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it!
0312995423|2.0|This book is for you if you believe: <br />A beautiful 170 IQ cryptographer can't subtract 235 from 238. <br />Technology explained clearly is better than technology explained correctly. <br />Amazing coincidences typically happen continuously. <br /> <br />Despite enjoying his other works, reading \\"Digital Fortress\\" was the morbid watching of a trainwreck.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After having just listened to this album, I can surely say that any and all Dream Theater fans will not be dissapointed. The title song \\"Octavarium\\" is, although slow at first, a very good song with strong emotion. It speeds up after a couple minutes and turns it an awsome song. The other songs are also sure to please, and I'm sure all who buy it, when released will be pleased.
0385510438|4.0|This is not your typical Grisham novel as it's set over a period of 9 years.  It could have used a little more character development and a little more suspense, but overall it was an interesting read.  Grisham does a good job of creating a believable setting and picks interesting story lines to follow.  Worth the read.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|GUESS WHAT- IF I DONT LIKE THE NEW DT- GONNA SPAM THAT ONE AS WELL- YOU WONT BEAT ME- HAHAHAHAHAHA
B00005JKC3|4.0|...though not a perfect one.  Most of the reviews on this site are completely off base.  One person questions the Hulk's ability to \\"jump as if there's no gravity.\\"  That's straight from the comic book!  As a longtime reader of the Incredible Hulk comics, I can tell you that this movie has quite a few things right.  The best Hulk stories have always been about Banner's inner war with his repressed personality and how it affects the people around him, and this movie showcases a lot of those elements.   I don't know if people expected a superhero movie, but Hulk has never been a superhero.  He has more in common with Frankenstein and Mr. Hyde than he does with Superman.  If you're looking for a superhero flick, check out Spider-man and Superman.  If you want to see some excellent sci-fi/horror/fantasy that might inspire discussion beyond, \\"Wasn't that cool when...,\\" check out the Hulk.
6305718954|5.0|...and I find \\"Stigmata\\" unique having never seen anything nearly as significant or as facinating as it is indeed. If you believe that there's more to life between earth and sky then I'd recommend you watching this, not that it is anything more than a movie, but it is clever made -and based on quite interesting elements of \\"truth\\" behind the religion of christianity. It might just make your imagination spin, and of course \\"Stigmata\\" intends to do just that -well, it works! (On me that is)    Fantastic picture, the same goes for the acting and the talented cast, Arquette and Byrne were as born for their parts -usually all movies contain one or more scenes that may irritate a little, something unecassary (even the movies that are your favorites) -but I find \\"Stigmata\\" complete. Not a second's wasted!    Keep in mind when you see \\"Stigmata\\" that this is not a horror-movie, and I'd recommend you watch it with the alternate ending.    Bravo!
B000002BSV|3.0|Coming Up is a fun album and you can see why Suede made it after the great but a bit suffocating Dog Man Star and going separate ways with original guitarist Bernard Butler.  There's lots of songs with loud, catchy guitar hooks about going out and experiencing life in Brett Anderson's decadence-filled London.  Half the album charted as singles and there are no real low spots.    As great as this all sounds, Anderson sings in a touch too-high voice throughout and combined with the sugary production pushes the album into some sort of glam/kiddie-pop territory that hurts its longevity.  Coming Up should bring back a lot of fond memories for those who played it growing up but it's a bit hard not to wince at almost 10 years on.
B00080ZG10|4.0|4.4 stars    Again, I missed this one on big screen.. so I had to watch it on rented DVD..    Good points:     Awe-inspiring story about a larger-than-life character.. Well, it's a Howard Hughes story! What do you expect?    Top notch acting.. DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors as far as I'm concerned. Don't believe me? Watch this movie and then go watch \\"What's eating gilbert grape?\\" again. Blanchett and Beckinsale, and Stefani all deliver as aspected. Can't even find flaws in the movie supporting cast.     Educational.. Well, you'll certainly learn a thing or two about a history of aviation from this movie.    Very cool DVD bonus features.. So the DVDs are actually worth buying even if you've already seen the movie on big screen..    Good script and good camera work.. I mean they are not like extraordinary but you can't quite find faults in them either.      Not so strong points:    I think it would have been a greater experience if I watched it on big screen. The movie is a bit too long and there is really nothing in the movie that keeps you glued to the screen when you are at home. I mean during the 170 mins, I paused five times to go get dinner, to go to the bathroom, and to check my emails.. that surely says something right? [and no I don't have a short attention span]    So maybe it's something to do with editing or the pace of the movie.. or it's probably that the story doesn't really have a climax/ climaxes.. [at least to me anyway].. I think they could have told the story in a more exciting way but since I'm not a filmmaker I don't know how LOL..    Another nitpick, I know that the goal of the movie is to make you like Howard Hughes.. but you know what it lacks something.. to make it more convincing. Howard Hughes is a charming man with great great great accomplishments but my impression of him is that he has many many many flaws too [not just his mental illness]. In this movie, they put emphasis on his mental state and his single-mindedness. Theyimply that everything else about Hughes is great. Well, I think the movie would have been much stronger if they made the Hughes character even more rounded. You know like.. show more of  his dark side but in the end still manage to make people admire who Hughes is/was.. [But that would definitely have been a much tougher job to pull off.]      Ok, to sum it up..     A GREAT GREAT GREAT movie with a big big big room for improvement!!!    Definitely a must-rent..     And I'm buying the DVDs because of the acting!
B00009V7T2|5.0|My friends told me about the Mars Volta, but I did not really listen to them after their recommendations. It was not until recently, when my friend lent me her copy of De-Loused in the Comatorium, that I listened to the album. It is extremely hard for me to classify their music. Words that comes to mind are: stupefying, astounding, extraordinary, staggering, and genius.  <br /> <br />I do not play any instruments, but The Mars Volta's album can make anybody appreciate the instruments played. I preferred this album to Frances the Mute, but they are both remarkable albums.
0393035158|5.0|For people of reason and even for people of faith, the book The End of Faith by Sam Harris is a must-read. The threat that religion and religious faith are to all of us, even to civilization itself, is clearly delineated. The chilling mess that religion has lead us to is documented, as are possible solutions for saving civilization. No one, including those who would be in agreement with the book's theses and those who would oppose and ban this book, can help but be transformed for the better by the ideas and concepts contained within The End of Faith. <br /> <br />Sadly, those that are unhappy with this book, i.e. the religious, will react in a totally predictable manner, that is, name call, attack the author, and of course, never deal with the issues raised. This is the way of religion and religious faith and is why religion and religious faith are the enemy to be defeated if we are all, religious and secular, to survive. <br />
B00004TFFS|5.0|I would definitely pick this up the day it is released if in fact this listing is accurate.  If it is a mistake, amazon needs to pay closer attention to what they are doing.  Currently, the only way to hear this digitally is either the CD that came out in '87 or the long out of print and now expensive MFSL gold disc.  I don't know what the band or Island records are up to by not remastering this in one way or another, other than using the original as a cash cow after 18 years, but this is a recording that would benefit greatly if released on SACD or DVD-Audio.
B0006Z2KX4|4.0|When this film was released in 1938, the great majority of filmgoers were young enough to have experienced the era of vaudevile, whose death knell had been sounded by the coming of &quot;talkies&quot; after 1927. For this reason the film was not so much of a hit as it is today. Considered old fashioned and a bit passe, these type of screwball comedies that borrowed heavily on vaudeville routines, no longer commanded broad appeal and the genre in general was soon confined to such lesser lights as Abbot and Costello.<BR>Flash forward 65 years and BRINGING UP BABY is now acclaimed as a minor masterpiece. That it harkens back to vaudeville is no longer a handicap. More entrancing is that it features two legends of the Silver Screen in their early prime. Cary Grant, who cut his teeth on the vaudeville circuit, is amazing in both his comic timing and his ability to carry off visual gags. To see the Grant who went on to become the very symbol of urbane sophistication stumbling around the set dressed in a night gown is priceless.<BR>     Screwball comedy is a matter of personal taste. Some people prefer comedy that arises out of a certain situation, rather than comedy generated for it's own sake, such as is evident in BRINGING UP BABY.  One weakness of the genre is that as one visual gag follows another in rapid fire succession, the viewer becomes somewhat jaded, just as a gourmet would feel after consuming too many chocolate bonbons in a single sitting. After an hour or so, my attention was beginning to wander because my brain was not able to connect to a discernable plot line. Although it was great fun to see Grant and Hepburn go through their paces, one's intellect was not engaged and in the end the film just seemed a bit longer than it really is.<BR>It's quite an honour for such a film to be featured in a two disc package. I am a big fan of Cary Grant and very much enjoyed the retrospection on his career. When they made Cary Grant they certainly did throw away the mould.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|After having placed De-loused as the best CD so far in the new millenium, I was really looking forward to their new record. And it has been a major dissapointment. I truly believe these guys are much more talented playing rock than playing prog. And in this CD prog dominates the whole thing. The few moments of rock brilliance are scarce and separated. If De-loused had some moments were songs started to go nowhere, here nowhere is the place where songs reside, appearing only for few moments. Omar has proved again he needs a producer with enough courage to cut songs where they have to. They seem to make longs songs just for the sake of it. Led Zeppelin played a song during 30 minutes and you didn't lose yourself. Here is just you are never found. These guys are probably the most talented guys out there right now. But TMV is having the attitude of the teeneger: rebel without a cause. Knowing they could be the greatest band, they burn their own talent. It is a real shame that such bright people don't understand that the most stupid are the ones who believe they are always right.
091581112X|5.0|<br /> <br />I am delighted to say I have had a copy of this book for several years and each time i dip into it, there is something new and different for me.It did take a little while for me to realise just what a gem it is. I have been on a conscious path of spiritual growth for many years and took a while to realise what a useful resource it is for both old hands and folks new to the path of spiritual growth. There are many exercises and techniques to choose from and regular, gentle application bears fruit. It reveals its gifts through time,and as I look back to when I first began to study and apply the contents, I can see how it has supported my blossoming. It is also a very good book for a group of friends to explore in a study group format as well. I have used it as a title for one of my own classes, and students were very pleased. I see it as a valuable resource for a lifetime.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|If you like juvenille humor, high school hijinxs, and sterotypes, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time.  You are indeed an IDIOT [a word you hear every 2 minutes] if you plunk down the $21 for this movie.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Post Downward Spiral Nine Inch Nails output has really been hardly worth the interminal wait.  I realize that Trent may need time to come up with great material, but he just hasn't come through on the promise of so much time.  While the Fragile, and now With Teeth, both sound enough like NIN, neither break any new ground or push the limits of extremes that was always what made NIN the untouchable great band that they once were.  Perhaps it's me and my changing tastes after so many years, probably not though since I still get a great kick from Downward Spiral, Broken, and Pretty Hate Machine.  Maybe it's all the mental issues Trent seems to have (Bi-polarism - cocaine addiction/ recovery) has just taken it out of him - or at least been a huge distraction.  Either way ten years is way too much time to wait for merely two albums of such average output.  Those of you who are into NIN will no doubt love this album, but I just can't endure reasonably OK music from a band that was exceptional and great.  I think I am done waiting.
B000002UJQ|4.0|If you are contemplating buying this CD, ask yourself this question, How did you feel about The Bends? There are two styles of music Radiohead has put out there. Pre-Kid A and Kid A and Amnesiac. I dont think people who like Kid A and Amnesiac will fall in love with this album. But, if you liked The Bends, you will most likely enjoy this CD just as much. I own all of Radioheads albums, and I like each one in their own way, but The Bends and Ok Computer are my all time favorite releases from this band. <br /> <br />Thom Yorke's voice is as haunting and brooding as ever. The music is simplistic, it lacks the electronic sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac. Its much more understated. I think this is one of those CD's that you really need to listen to all the way through about three times to really appreciate it. You will understand the messages better. <br /> <br />This is a great album from begining to end. Paranoid Android is one of the best songs on the CD. Its a really creative, artistic album. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Problem 1: People who take on side immediately, only because they want to feel connected to the \\"mass\\" pop-culture audience.  This is no mystery or suprise; be it sports, fashion, cars, vacation spots, etc., people desire connection to larger things mostly out of dissapointment from their own failures, losses, and frustrations.  Gibson did not just pander to the religious-right bible thumping deep south fanatics, but what he really was after was placing blame square on someone's shoulders: seeing that Morgenstern's father had to beg Mel to cut out the blood be on your children part, it's pretty straightforward as to where he comes from and who he wishes to demonize.  Furthermore, Gibson is staunchly Roman Catholic, demanding that people follow him and keep prayers in the Latin tongue...umm, alright Mel, frankly that whole side to you is lame and passe; it's like saying to someone \\"Hey, do these prayers my way or the highway!\\"  Mel really looked to place blame and rekindle old doubts and frictions between the Vatican and the Middle East; perhaps he had is way in that respect.  Main Point: Mel loves his Vatican and old religious practices and tried to turn the good Christians in America toward the side of the Vatican.  Result: very bad move. <br />Problem 2: Religion or Race?  What is really more important and deeply engrained in the minds of most peoples?  Do you cast greater prejudice on grounds of physical features or religious affiliations?: Answer, race motivates on a deeper, actually realistic level as compared to phony religious claimings.  All of the worlds struggles, great conflicts, boil down to nationalistic pride and xenophobia more so than religious differences; e.g. the Persians allowing Jerusalem to be a site of worship for all peaceful peoples.  The real cancer on the Earth today is still the Vatican, which is itself pagan and by no means perfect (crusades, persecutions, papal bullying of nations including England and Germany by Romes legions, grand inquisition, etc.).  Will there ever be an African Pope?  Ha, not bloody likely.  Let's be real people, the world is determined and judged not by titles or teams (though commendment and numbers do help a cause) but by physical looks and similarities to our own ideals and preferences.  Main Point: Cut the nonsense, this world of ours is a cyclic sphere of national aspirations and individual coruption when faced with far-reaching decisions.  Result: we judge not by content of character or work ethic but by ideals. <br />Problem 3: Religious difference as excuse for Racial decimation.  The Vatican, Mel's favorite big brother, that old institution in Rome once hellbent on ruling the world (how dare these thugs in robes who do little work...Karol Wojytola or John Paul II as an exception...and do absolutely nothing for science or human alleviation but would rather tell women how to live and enjoy old religious ceremonies tell whole nations and unique peoples such as Russia and China how to live) has been shown in the last few years (child molestation and financial fraudulence) to be highly corrupt and hypocritical.  How can Rome try to invade England and ruin Germany and deploy Spanish troops to Ireland hundreds of years ago, leaving death and destruction in their wake (Mel should have thought harder when making Braveheart, but being chauvanistic as he is, he forgot how the Scottish painted their faces blue and fought off Catholic Roman and Spanish troops trying to invande and take over the British Isles, not fight the English who have been a model nation to the world in regards to civilty and scientific thought...Newton ring a bell anyone?).  Main Point: for a nonspiritual demagoguery such as the Vatican to escape unscathed for what they've done to so many nations who were gentle and intellgent and progressive all until Catholic dogma invaded, they've really dodged quite a few bullets.  However, their time is running out.  Result: a world growing increasingly tired of relgious teachings as their ever evolving senses tell them of its use as a pretext for conquests and plundering. <br />Problem 4: As the brilliant Harvard professor Samuel Huntington has portrayed in his books on clashes of cultures and remaking world order, the world is by no means stable.  Not even after civil wars, revolutions, world wars, coups....none have secured the longlasting peace so hoped for by many, but not all (e.g. thugs, gangs, criminals, dictators - the less intelligent real-life monsters of past and present).  The world of tommrrow is not one of religion (even south america is growing apart thanks to hugo chavez's finger pointing at america) but one of national identity...ironically, that has always been the case.  Main Point: integration and segregation continue to pull at eachother, fracturing America more than ever before.  The unrealistic thoughts of everyone \\"liking\\" each other and just \\"getting along\\" are over, and have never been much more than false words for false security.  Result: An America and Western world that wakes up to the threats from the east, a new China that could be peaceful partner or worst nightmare, and countries forced to take extreme measures due to unwanted influences (i.e. muslims taking over London's streets, France becoming a barnyard bash that doesn't work, and China wanting to remain a cultural empire unhinged by capitalism.  The world will survive and grow as old ideas of how to do just such collapse across the globe.  Dogma fails while reason, service, and a new humanity to all neighbors, be they of any race, flourishes.  The Herculean Man-God ideal fades as people grow tired of God being white, black, asian, green, blue, etc.  The world matures, people relax spiritually, and scientific advance continues to do some good, some bad.  As John Lennon so poetically said, sometimes we all have to \\"Let It Be.\\"
B000092ZYX|4.0|I find this to be an interesting album. It is like Thom Yorke took 'Ok Computer', 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' and blended them together to form 'Hail To The Thief'. I can agree with the other reviewers that this album does lack some flow. But, Radiohead has never been able to fit into some sort of formula. <br /> <br />This album takes longer to \\"get into\\", so to speak. I had to listen to it a few times to truly appreciate it. I remember feeling the same way with 'Kid A', and I like that album a lot now.  I really like the title of this album and how it corelates with the 2000 election. I find Radiohead's tongue and cheek response funny. <br /> <br />I think this album does fit into any Radiohead fan's collection. Its a good album, but maybe not as brilliant as Kid A, The Bends, or Ok Computer. It is still good stuff. If you are new to Radiohead, this may not be the best album to start off with. Try 'The Bends' or 'Ok Computer.'
B00000099Y|5.0|This isn't just the best metal album ever made. In my opinion it's the best album ever made, all categories. I felt I had to write something and try to contribute towards the 5 stars overall this album deserves. I don't blame the people who gave it one star, it's their opinion, and maybe this album isn't for everyone. First of all, you have to like music. Second, you should like metal. Third, you should be enough interested in life and like the medium of music to express aspects of life. I have owned this album for seven years and it still grows. I can still cry listening to it, just because of the beauty, the pure energy this album conveys. A masterpiece, from the first second to the last. A lesson in life.
B00004STDN|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was in theaters, and even on this second viewing, I found myself on the edge of my seat in the opening sequence.  Director Renny Harlin gives us a breathtaking, ultimately horrific, scene in which a young inexperienced climber fights for her life, and loses.  From this point on, CLIFFHANGER maintains that sense of dizzying tension and is one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies.  With gorgeous scenery and awesome \\"cliffhanging\\" sequences, CLIFFHANGER never lets up and is a pure adrenaline rush.  Stallone does well, as does his supporting cast:  John Lithgow (whom I will never forgive for killing Nancy Allen in Blowout); Craig Fairbass as the psychotic soccer player; Rex Linn as the repulsive Travers; Janine Turner as the lovely love interest; Michael Rooker as the onetime friend of Stallone's, and of course, Michelle Joyner as Sarah, whose plea for Stallone to save her life is as gutwrenching as ever.  For pure testosterone thrills, CLIFFHANGER is still one of the best.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I love this album, this and Tools Aenima was the main influences for the band I played in at '96. It has meant very much for me over the years. I love the mood this record gets you in. To call this Nu-metal is wrong I think, the genre didn't exist at the time it was made and I don't want to put it in the same genre as alot of bands that doesn't have the same quality as Deftones. The sound is abit rough, but I like that. That puts the focus more on the songs and the lyrics, which are great. At the beginning of owning this album Root was my favourite, but now I think it's Minus Blindfold or Lifter. The music isn't technically advanced, and I think that's good, actually. Music is about feeling, and you should do what it takes to convey the feelings you want to convey. To play advanced stuff just because you're able isn't good. Then you're just showing off, forgetting about the point of it all. I give this album a 5, because of the historical aspect of it, and the fact that they are masters of setting the mood and expressing strong feelings. Along with Tool Deftones is the best metal band out there, period.
0671027387|4.0|This masterful novel gives the reader a sense of adventure and suspense from the beginning to end. In the beginning we meet Rachel Sexton, who is helping the president win his re-election against her own father, Sedgewick Sexton. Unfortunately for Rachel, this makes many people become suspicious of her and what she's doing on the opponent's campaign. Nonetheless, the president proves Rachel's loyalty to everyone on his campaign, by sending her out to Antarctica where a revolutionary NASA discovery has just been made. From the moment Rachel gets to Antarctica, she endures many near death experiences. Rachel, along with two civilian scientists, try to do everything in their powers to survive and give the world the shocking information about the NASA discovery. The question now is whether or not they gave the information to the president on time, and if they survived the whole ordeal which you haveto read to find out......

B0007Y08I8|4.0|This movie is REALLY funny. But - really offensive. There was an interesting msn article recently about how the South Park guys Trey Parker and Matt Stone (who are the same ones that did this movie) are some kind of \\"puzzle\\" becuase they mock the left and the right. But what if the reason that they mock both right and left is because they're libertarian? It's a good thing to keep in mind while watching the movie, at any rate.  They certainly ream all parties concerned with very little mercy! <br /> <br />Best quote: \\"We will handle this with talk and reasoning... the F.A.G. way.\\"
B0008ISM40|4.0|Trent Reznor is back with another trip through his psyche in With Teeth, and this time, it's a rock and roll trip. Six years after the release of his last studio album, The Fragile Trent brings us an album that at face value has a alt-rock sound, yet has all the underpinnings of a true Nine Inch Nails release. The album is subtly complex full of the layering fans would expect from a follow up to Downward Spiral and The Fragile, but may not be immediately aware of them as they blend in so naturally with the composition. With Teeth separates itself from its predecessors with high energy tracks throughout the album, with a notable exception of the quiet Right Where It Belongs. Driving this energy is the rock record finish on this album of trashy guitars and driving percussion, a majority of the live percussion done by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters. The emotion of the album shows in Trents signature vocals and a matured version of angst and anger in the lyrics and music. Longtime fans may miss the abundance of harsh synthesizers and wildly distorted guitar found in previous albums. <br /> <br />With Teeth is rife with the sound of rock clichs spun through the industrial machine that is Nine Inch Nails. The first single from the album \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is commercial rock so riddled with clichd questions and just as if not more compelling then Closer was when it was released. Edges of punk rock come out in Getting Smaller, and Only has a opening and a synth line that could have come straight out of an 80's new wave hit. Sunspots stands out sounding like something that R.E.M. might have done coming out of a week-long drug bender. Something that surprised me so much to find on a Nine Inch Nails album that I had to replay the track several times, Right Where It Belongs has a definite country western bend to it and could have been this albums Hurt given a different treatment. With multiple plays I am positive any listener will be able to draw lines connecting the sounds ofWith Teeth to all corners of the rock genre. <br /> <br />I applaud Trent and the marketing at Nothing Records for providing everything this or any album needs for the art that is the entire package to survive in the digital age. Neither physical format of the album comes with much more liner notes than a track listing and a web link to find all the information at a page for the album on nin.com including downloadable PDF versions to print and save.
B00005LOLD|2.0|ok im young and im so in love with marlon brando's acting that is's just sick ok. But this film was one of his worst of all time. It just didn't do anything for me, The accent he had was horrible. The story line was also lacking. It was a big waste of my time. This whole movie is about loving someone that you cant have and is set in hong kong and tokyo. Im going to say it agian it was just really, really boring.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin's debut Album Chariot tops any other CD I've ever listened to. When I listen to an artist I like them to play their own insrtuments and write their own songs. Gavin does both and has an amazing voice. This CD is something that you can listen to at all times of the DAY! The Chariot CD pumps you up for an awesome day and the Chariot Stripped Bonus CD, calms your nerves after a long day. I have never been so excited to tell my friends about an artist as I was after I listened to Gavin.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I think this is maybe the worst album from DT. I'm completely amazed how unique their playing is and how much their songs vary in the previous albums. DT is unlike many bands... for example if you've heard one metallica album, you've heard them all, but every DT album is different.  <br /> <br />Again, they've made an album that's definantely different, but unfortunately it's no good. It's not that i don't like heavy stuff, it's just that i don't like DT:s heavy stuff. The reason heavy doesn't fit DT is James LaBrie. His voice is no good. I get cold shivers when he tries to scream high notes especially in the live performances... on the other hand his voice is nearly perfect in vacant and other albums like six degrees. On ToT his singing melodies are almost nothing compared to what they've been in many other albums. But why in the world does he rap in this album?  <br /> <br />Another dissapointment is Petrucci. How can, in my oppinion, the best guitarist in the world make this kind of s*it? How can his guitarplaying be so mindless shredding... no musicality at all. Every song on the album execpt vacant has a solo. Nothing wrong with that if the solos were good and would vary but they're all as fast as petrucci can play with no musical content at all. I just hate seeing such a good player doing this kind of music. Before his playing has been something that i've never experienced before. No guitarist in the world has made such great music that i never get bored listening to it. His live performances in the mid 90:s are incredible. For example Steve Vai is a good guitarist, but he's a bad musician. Most of his music is boring and unoriginal... it's meaning is only to show how technically proficient he is... I think petruccis playing has gone to the same point in ToT... his solos have no idea... or atleast if there were an idea you couldn't here it because it's played so fast its. Playing fast should be a tool to accomplish expressing a feeling for example or something. Fast parts should balance the slow parts to make the music more alive. Speed shouln't be the purpose itself like on ToT it is. <br /> <br />The album has it's good moments too. Vacant balances the albums heavy songs, and does a great job at it. Stream of Conciousness i think is the best song off of the album...the most musical and it has a good feeling to it in the name of god is also great but maybe a bit too long. As for the first 4 songs... they are awful. As i am,The dying soul and honor thy father sound almost like any angry teen music... they have their good parts also but it doesn't help much. Endless sacrifice has atleast some effort. After hearing other DT albums, it isn't just enough that the songs are ok, they have to have something that makes me listen to them over and over again. The 4 first songs definantly aren't those kinds of songs.  <br /> <br />I think everyone of you who read these appreciate good music... otherwise you wouldn't listen to dream theater. Because of this i have to suggest you all listen to a german band called Superior. I think it's the best that heavy metal as a genre can offer. The singer is amazing and their music is just incredible compared to train of thought. And if many of you consider Train of Thought good... well you should really listen to it. <br />
B00012FXAE|5.0|Ok, hard to add things to the hundreds of reviews, but since I just watched this again last night, and just read through many reviews, here are my thoughts.  The space marines are what the starship troopers should have been like, and in fact, I believe this movie team used the starship trooper novel as the reference for the marines.  Yes, I agree with the nitpicks on them not using certain ammo or Paxton's crying, but come on, who wouldn't be crying after what they've been through?  I can't believe anybody would bag on the first Alien movie, Aliens is so excellent, but the first movie is incredible.  My friends and I often wonder whether or not we could write our own sequel and have it be better than what hollywood put out.  Part III was worthless, and part IV was OK.  I've always wondered how another installment would play out, and while I've put some thought into how it what and how it should be, I don't think I've come up with anything impressive.  Alien vs Predator was fair, although they really could have kicked ass with that one, a lost opportunity.  Alien V has potential, as long as it includes the Alien home planet, we'll see if it ever makes it out.
0790731002|4.0|I know I'm one of the few to say this, but to me...this was the best Batman movie and I'll tell you why. First, I'll give a short account of the story. Batman is out to save Gotham City from 2 villains now, Two-Face and the Riddler. A new psychologist is in town, and of course falls for Batman, and Robin is introduced in the Batman series...the story ensues.    I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie. I experienced what I could say was somewhat of a guilty pleasure. This was largely due to the acting and the introduction of 2 of my favourite villains in the Batman comic series. Val Kilmer is a talented but often misused actor in Hollywood. Given certain roles, he really shines and I thought he made a wonderful Batman. I liked the first 2 Batman movies as well, but the main problem I had was that Michael Keaton did not look the part of a vigilante caped crusader kicking a$$ in the streets of Gotham and protecting the people. Kilmer looks much more cooler and pulls of Batman very well. Another thing I liked about Kilmer was he played Batman as a tormented man, a man haunted by his past. That is after all why he chose to be Batman, to use the bat as a symbol to fight crime. I thought this was a good angle for Bruce Wayne/Batman.    After Jack Nicholson so superbly defined Joker in Batman...he brought Batman villains to a whole new level. And here, we have Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as Riddler. I thought they were both very fun to watch. Tommy Lee Jones was obviously having a great time playing his character. This is after all a comic book movie, and he outdoes himself with all the over-the-top acting as well as that evil laugh. Fantastic! And Jim Carrey basically plays himself. That whole wacky persona he gives Riddler goes very well and the things he says and does brings a smile to me everytime. Chris O'Donnell plays the role of a rebellious teen quite well and manages to pull off Robin with as much enthusiasm as anyone could have. Nicole Kidman (her pre-Oscar days) brings a lot of sexiness and female power to her role of Dr. Chase Meridien. The first time I watched this movie, I was 13 and I remember I had a crush on her for days.    Much has been said about director Joel Schumacher's take on this movie and while it is definitely different from Burton's style of directing, I thought it was really good. Heck, Tim Burton was co-producer so I guess he was okay with it as well. Where Burton's Batman was darker and more gothic, Schumacher's is an attack on your sensors. A no holds barred splash of colors and sounds without being annoying or irritating and I thoroughly enjoyed that.    Finally I just want to say that, this is a very entertaining movie to watch. Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, don't over-analyze it...I mean, it's a comic book movie after all, and things are supposed to be over-the-top and crazy at times. That's why it's fun to watch. A little known fact, this movie is actually the 2nd highest grossing Batman in the U.S. and worldwide for that matter, after the first Batman. So, believe me...this is far from terrible, and as I said...it's the best Batman for me. Hope you found my review helpful and if you haven't watched this movie, please do!
B00080ZG10|4.0|I saw this film in theatrical release and definitely agree with most of the reviewers on here who thought it was beautifully shot.  I enjoyed all of the flight sequences, and the \\"life-altering\\" flight sequence that occurs at about the midway point left me a little short of breath.  Dicaprio and Blanchett both gave great performances (Blanchett definitely deserves her Academy Award), and I was very pleasantly surprised to see John C. Reilly show up in the cast as he was never credited in any of the trailers I had seen.   <br /> <br />I will not dwell on plot details, you can read those pretty much anywhere else, but I will say that I felt the movie succeeded more in recounting Howard Hughes' dedication to his planes than in chronicling his battles with his inner demons (OCD and other symptoms of mental strain and anguish).  From a biographical standpoint, I really can't comment on the accuracy of the portrayed events, but as a casual filmgoer, I felt like there was a 20-25 minute period in the latter half of the movie that seemed to unglue itself from an otherwise cohesive movie.   <br /> <br />However, the court case and the ending scene were both very satisfying, and I left the theater with a smile.
B00061QJZI|2.0|I just had no interest at all in watching this one; I just didn't think I could stand Will Ferrel again after I suffered through \\"Elf\\". But for a measly $2 a rental around here, I figured I'd grab a bunch that I didn't wanna see, because the ones I really have wanted to see have been crap, and I figured the ones I didnt wanna watch would probably become new found favorites.    Well, this is by far NOT a new found favorite, but it was OK and seeing as how I was thinking it would probably be one I'd turn off after 30 minutes, it survived a whole screening from me.     The humor is a little weak through a lot of the movie, but some parts got me laughing.     Just a rental/wait for TV imo.     The high point is what Will says to San Deago that results in him getting fired. The low point is there is a small scene with Ben Stiller. I rolled my eyes and nearly puked, is there any non-stoner comedies made in the past few years that doesn't have him in it?
B000005J56|5.0|I have never listened to Cuban music in my life until 5 yrs ago when I happened upon a PBS special with the Buena Vista Social Club.  I am in love.  This stuff is fabulous.  What treasures these old Cuban singers are.  This CD is wonderful ... makes you think you are in a little club in Havana or somewhere on a hot, humid beach in Miami ... the music literally transports you -- most music cannot do that.<br /><br />I think a few of these treasures have since passed but this music will live on carrying their names on the wind forever.  Wonderful music for Cuban or South Florida dreaming.  Enjoy!
051788710X|5.0|I loved this book, and found it to be a very \\"shamanic\\" dreamwork manual.   It has wonderful exercises for both the beginning and more advanced  dreamworker and includes everything you could imagine, from dream incubation, dream reentry and working with nightmares to shape-shifting, meeting deceased loved ones, angels and psychic self defense.   <br /> <br />Conscious Dreaming has much to offer both the beginning and more advanced dreamworker and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding out more about their inner world of the Dreamtime.   <br /> <br />
1565117700|3.0|Since \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is about two ranch hands--Geogre (the more intelligent of the two who keeps his friend and their jobs in line) and Lennnie (a very large, mentally hadicapped man who underestimates his own physical strength on many occasions)--that must find work at a new ranch since they got into trouble at the old one and end up repeating their misfortune, the stroyline is a little dry.  The book opens witht the two friends camping out in the woods while traveleing to their new job location.  They are running from an angry mob looking to lynch them since Lennie allegedly \\"raped\\" a women.  The truth is that Lennie has the simple mindset of a young child and needs to touch everything to fully understand it.  He went to touch the woman's dress and wouldn't let go.  Now that Lennie and George are making camp in the woods for the night, Lennie entertains himself by catching mice.  He likes to hold and pet them, but he squeezes too hard and the mice keep dying.  (At this point, I felt a little betrayed by the title of the novel.  \\"Of Mice and Men\\" sounds emotional and philosophical with powerful hidden messages about mankind and life as a whole.  Who knew it was a about some big guy who goes around crushing little animals because he likes to pet them?)  Anyway, George and Lennie reach the ranch and meet all of the other ranch hands, including Candy (an old cripple in charge of maintenance) and his dog.  At the end of the night, when the men return to their quarters after work, they complain that Candy's dog stinks and they don't want him around.  They also think that it is cruel to le the dog live in misery, since he is old and bilnd and can't eat, so one of the men takes the dog outside and shoots him in the back of the head.  (Get the tissues ready--a real tearjerker!)  However, another dog on the ranch has just had puppies, so Candy can raise a new one.  Lennie also wants one so that he can hold and pet it.  Sure enough, though, Lennie holds the dog too tightand crushes it to death.  The boss of the ranch's son, Curley, has a new wife that lives on the ranch.  She tries to console Lennie about the loss of his pet by letting him touch her hair.  Big mistake--doesn't she know this guy's track record?  Anyway, Lennie holds on too tight and breaks her neck.  Now a new angry mob--the hands on this ranch--are chasing after Lennie.  He ends up back in the woods where the novel started out.  (In this sense, the book starts to come full circle.)  George has always loooked out for Lennie and tried to protect him, but not this time.  George has gun, and shoots Lennie in the back of the head.  (Not exactly a happy ending.) <br />Liking and appreciating this book comes with looking at the story in retrospect.  Hidden somehwere in this grim tale are messages about relationships, companionship, survival, suffering, and human emotion.  The concept of the American Dream is also woven through the book, since George and Lennie have hopes of earning enough money to buy their own land.  Their dream seems unattainable, until George kills Lennie and revives his own chances of success.  Overall, the story is certainly unique and it's interesting to see how the book became a classic.  I haven't put it at the top of my list, but it is a good read.  ( And it's real short!)  Enjoy.
B000069AUI|4.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  This is what not only what rock and roll is about, but also music.  In a recent interview I read about Coldplay in Blender Magazine, they acknowledged the fact that they weren't \\"flashy\\" in a sense where playing their instruments was concerned because \\"they couldn't\\" be.  While they may have limitations (very few people don't), they used their attributes as musicians to the very best of their abilities, hence making better albums than some bands with more experienced musicians.  I have no doubt that A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD will forever be a part of Rock and Roll History as one of its best albums.  After more than 2 years, it is still a much hailed/ talked about album.  No offense to Simple Plan (who'm I'm a fan of), but are we going to be talking about it 2 years after its initial release (...Still Not Getting Any).  No, simply on the basis that Coldplay's material is more focused and filled with more depth compared to say a punk band like Simple Plan.<br /><br />With that said, everyone will most likely say that \\"Clocks\\" is their very favorite track.  My favorite happens to be the haunting opening track \\"Politik\\".  It is just so well written with an opening crescendo of hard rocking guitars that then grow in dimunition to Chris Martin's solo piano line while he sings in his somber voice.  It will give you chills, especially when Martin ascends into his falsetto.<br /><br />I won't give an individual critique of the rest of the tracks.  But I will summarize with this that this is an enjoyable listening and a stellar album.  I am a person who listens to more urban stuff probably than say rock and roll, but as an open-eared listener, who could deny the incredible musicianship and sound that Coldplay posess on this rock masterpiece? Well so much for short and sweet!<br /><br />Track Picks:  \\"Politik\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"God Put A Smile On Your Face\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\"
B000002GQH|5.0|This is the first of many 5 star (in my opinion) efforts to follow. The songs are all great. The weakest tunes on here are Pinder's 'Have You Heard' pts 1&2. They are still very good songs - just not stellar. Everything from the concept and songwriting to the musicianship and sound production is fantastic. This music in itself justifies a very confusing period in the culture of popular music circa 1969. There is so much crap out there, why don't you just pick up an album like this and let it speak to you!!!??? Timeless music. Pertinent today as it was nearly 40 years ago. A nice collection of great songs. The Moodies were on the threshold of something BIG with this release. Pick it up - tickle your ears and lift your spirit.
B00079018K|5.0|I just wanted to let one of the reviewers know that the song, \\"Club Foot\\", was used in the trailer for \\"Serenity\\". I hope I could be of some help. I need to buy the CD now - I'm going to the concert on June 15th....
B00008MNYS|4.0|The satirical self-absorption, at turns self-deprecation, of this artist may not always be appealing, but Robbie Williams can't be ignored. No matter what the context, his confident, original styling is worth a listen. Such is the case this time.  Not without its flaws, \\"Escapology\\" still makes for an entertaining musical experience. Aimed at the mass (some have argued specifically American) market, it runs the gamut of genres from hard to soft rock, from alternative to folk-rock. That eclectic mix would deter some, but Williams' broad vocal dimension enables him to \\"to cover it all.\\"<br /><br />The best of the selections, \\"Feel,\\" ranks with \\"Angels\\" as perhaps one the finest compositions the Guy Chambers- Robbie Williams writing team has penned. It is fitting that it would be on this, their last album together.  It begins with a rhythmic, solo piano intro; then Robbie, sounding better than ever, enters, singing, \\"C-mon take my hand, I want to contact the living,\\" followed by a clever, cascading melody line culminating in a crescendo chorus of, \\"I just want to FEEL real love.\\" Of deserved notice as well are: \\"One Fine Day,\\" with masterful irony in the phrases and a memorable musical refrain; \\"Something Beautiful,\\" an R & B  thumper reminiscent of Wilson Pickett; a suprising treat, \\"Me and My Monkey\\" where Robbie dabbles in very witty, eccentric story-telling, and \\"Nan's Song,\\" a tribute to his grandmother and the first song for which he wrote both the music and the lyrics.<br /><br />What is clear on several of the other tracks is Robbie's desire to push the boundaries, to allow more of his in-your-face, brash character to come through.  While these songs reflect his inward preoccupation, they are simultaneously a symbol of the real battle waged in the studio. Williams' efforts to make a rawer, what he believes more honest, statement have prevailed here over Chambers' previously successful attempts to produce a slick, conventional package: \\"Sexed Up\\" is a colorless,biting farewell to a former lover; \\"Get a Little High\\" suggests some liberating though disturbing options to the downtrodden; \\"Handsome Man\\" [in what appears a purposeful foil to \\"Better Man\\" on his previous album] finds Robbie saying he's the center of the universe- \\"I'm the one who put the 'Brit' in celebrity\\"- though, as usual, we get the impression that he's not sure he belongs there. \\"Monsoon\\" and the power ballad, \\"Come Undone,\\" (\\"Because I'm scum, I'm your son, I've come undone\\") move even further toward Robbie's unrestricted, self-promoting/self-doubting side.  A bit offensive and rather rudimentary in form, they are nonetheless compelling.<br /><br />This is not the British pop star's best CD, but it could very well be his most interesting.  What we are actually hearing are the last vestiges of his past alongside portents of what will come.  After listening to it all, you may find yourself trying to decide which Robbie Williams you like better.
6302763835|4.0|Sometimes I really wish I had been born 15 years earlier so I would have been able to enjoy great films like \\"Them\\" and \\"Tarantula\\" at a drive-in movie.  That really would have been fun.  Tarantula has always been one of my favorites in the Giant insect genre of films and I rank it right up there (almost) with \\"Them\\".<br /><br />Professor Deemer is working on an experimental nutrient to solve the worlds hunger problem.  During a fight with an assistant, a Tarantula that had been injected with the experimental formula escapes and begins to mutate, growing large and larger.  Soon the giant arachnid is out feeding on livestock, ranchers, and just about anything else that gets in its way.  A local doctor played by the great John Agar eventually is able to determine that white stuff found at the site of the attacks is spider venom.  Soon the local police and residents take on the giant spider but bullets and even dynamite don't slow it down.  Finally its decided to call in the Air Force where we get a brief glimpse of Clint Eastwood in an early, uncredited role as an air force pilot.<br /><br />Sure the special effects are cheesy by today's CGI standards but this is still a great movie and wonderful fun.  The type you want to watch on a summer night at the drive in with a big bowl of popcorn.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Every new album for Robert Plant is a bold new adventure.  Or so the man likes to declare.  He hates to retread past hooks and keeps pushing on restlessly for a new sound.  Well it looks like he's finally found his peace.  His last album Dreamland was too slow and quiet for me - like a spring fountain.  This album is more like a hot geyser, flowing with great ideas.<br /><br />With Mighty Rearranger, Plant has managed at last, to leverage years of sounds and experience and distill it into a unique sounding rock album which pleases the ear and yet doesn't sound hackneyed.  Past albums were either too minimalist or tried too hard.  Mighty Rearranger manages to find that balance and is a very well produced album.<br /><br />Diverse and mature, Plant compares this effort to Zep's Physical Graffiti.  What really works is the band - the drums are excellent and make you sit up and listen.  The atmosphere is there and Plant's voice does the job just right.  He may be evolving and getting older, but this is worth listening to.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey can sing.  Whether she is singing the uninspired material gracing here 2000 albums, or singing the excellent material from her heydey in the 1990s (who can forget getting chills from the Carey-Boyz II Men collaboration on \\"One Sweet Day\\"?), Carey can clearly sing.  The truth of the matter is that Mariah Carey is a much better singer than a lot of people who are debuting for the first time in the R&B/Pop/Hip-Hop world.  True, THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI has its \\"flat\\" moments as I like to refer to them as, but it truly is Mariah's strongest and most omnipresent album in recent times.  If you add up its weekly totals, it will surely surpass CHARMBRACELET in album sales and it already has surpassed all of her previous openings.<br /><br />With that said, there are three standouts on THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI.  They are the club-dance influenced \\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\" (it is a shame that that single didn't pick up at radio as well as it should've), \\"MINE AGAIN\\", a very strong ballad that will give you chills listening to it, and \\"SAY SOMETHING\\" featuring Snoop Dogg, A Neptunes produced track.  I personally find myself playing these tracks the most of any of the tracks on the album.<br /><br />There are of course what I like to refer as the \\"lesser hits\\".  \\"We Belong Together\\" is definitely deserving to be the #1 single that it is.  The thing that makes it a lesser hit is the fact that it reminds you of past Mariah Carey ballads with its overall feel.  Also \\"Stay The Night\\" which samples soul classic \\"Betcha By Golly Wow\\" is very worthy.<br /><br />Tracks that could've been left behind are what plague THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI.  Certainly \\"Shake It Off\\" is really an example of a filler song where a more welcome selection the caliber of \\"It's Like That\\" or \\"Say Something\\" would've been more appropriate.  Also \\"Get Your Number\\" featuring Jermaine Dupri fails miserably.  Had it not been for non-hits, this album would've been top rate Mariah Carey material.  Despite its flat moments (especially as the album progresses),  Mimi truly has returned with here voice and is right in her element in the R&B world where she belongs.  Good Effort Mimi!ite its flat moments (especially as the album progresses),  Mimi truly has returned with here voice and is right in her element in the R&B world where she belongs.

B000002GQJ|5.0|Answer - because they are fundamentally opposed to what the Hall stands for! and they know it! (the Hall that is). It really doesn't bother me, except that my kids are dying to go to the Hall but we WILL NOT until/unless the Moodies are admitted. But that's O.K. Their music lives on in our hearts, so to speak. This album is also weaved together seamlessly by the craft of Tony Clarke. I love this music. I wish there were more bands that were this intellectually honest about their art. It's obvious that the MB's were more concerned with a faithful portrayal of 'what it means to be alive' than with the current party scene, or the current Rock-n-Roll sound/persona. Thank God for that. Pick it up. You cannot lose.
B000002L9J|5.0|Besides standing out as the Smiths greatest achievement \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is that rare specimen of an album that has several clear highlights(notably\\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\",\\"Some Girls are Bigger than others\\"and \\"Frankly Mr.Shankly\\")but works best as an ensemble piece since all the songs contribute to a flow that propels the record towards a quality well beyond the worth of the individual tracks.<br /><br />Also Morrissey's lyrics are better than ever,be it on the title tracks's rant,on the surreally comic \\"Bigmouth Strikes again\\"(\\"now I know how Joan of Arc felt\\"),on\\"I know it's over\\"'s downbeat sentiments or in \\"There is a light that never goes out\\"'s ultra romantic fatalism.<br /><br />And of course there's Johnny Marr's magical guitar to add that extra colour that made them so unique and compellingly vital in the 80's.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|It is very rare for a debut album to explode on the scene like the gorillaz's first cd.  not only was it a sonic masterpiece, but a visual one to boot.  the pressure on the sophmore effort must have been tremendous.  the Gorillaz's Demon Days has delivered and then some.  The album may not have the new innovative feel as the first one, because we have seen it before, but the album itself, may actually be better.  the last sophmore to top a debut album that comes to mind is pearl jam's Vs as compared to ten.  there are many good songs,the best being <br />dirty harry (in keeping with the clint eastwood reference of the 1st album), feel good inc, dare, fire coming out of a monkeys head, dont get lost in heaven, and o green world.  there are some great cameos here, including de la soul, shaun ryder, an dennis hopper.  this is another masterpiece of an album.  who new damon alburn was this multitalented,  not oasis thats for sure.  if you liked the 1st cd buy this immediately.   <br />
0321334876|5.0|How do you improve a book that has been known as a \\"bible\\" in the C++ community for years?  As Scott mentions at the beginning of the text, he almost threw everything out, and started from scratch.  When I first say the book, I thought that there are five new items that were added to the book, but I couldn't be more wrong.  As you might have guessed, C++ has gone thru a number of significant changes over the past decade, and the third edition of this book is updated to take advantage of the new editions to the C++ standard.  In reality, almost every item in this book has gone thru a re-write.  Many have been consolidated and new chapters, topics and many new items have been added.  A few items that did not make sense anymore like items 2, 3 and 4 in the second edition are removed from this third edition.   <br /> <br />Scott breaks down the c++ language into 4 subparts:  <br />* The old C subsystem.  Before all these advanced programming languages such as Java and .NET came, C was the language of choice.   C++ is \\"translated\\" to C first, and then complied and linked to an executable.   <br />* OO C++, which is C with Classes.  This is where the concept of Object Orientation in C++ started.  Even though this concept was very much new a decade ago, it is very much part of a programmer's vocabulary. <br />* Template C++, which is the newest edition to the C++ standard and it brings with it the concept of Template Metaprogramming.  This concept is very much new, and this book has dedicated a whole chapter around templates, and template metaprogramming.   <br />* STL, which is the C++ Standard Template Library.  Again, STL was a new concept a few years back, but it is very much an established notion in C++.   <br /> <br />Scott has taken a new approach to this book and has covered all four of these subparts.  He has a book dedicated to STL, but he is using STL notions and \\"language\\" throughout this book.  The chances are that the reader is already familiar with other languages such as Java and .Net, so the text covers area where these two languages differ with C++, especially in the area of inheritance and polymorphism.  But not everything has changed.  Topics such as,\\"Explicitly disallow the use of Compiler Generated functions you do not want,\\" will never get old or outdated.   <br /> <br />New chapters cover topics such as C++ Template and Generic Programming, Resource Allocation and topics that cover the latest C++ standard and additions, including the TR1 (Technical Report 1).  \\"new and delete\\" have been separated into their own chapter, and the author goes into great depth demonstrating to the reader the various ways that these two operators can be modified, and why.   <br /> <br />Exceptions and programming in light of exceptions is also a very new concept in C++.  The previous versions on this text did not touch on exceptions all that much, but the author has spread the use of exceptions throughout the text, with a number of items dedicated explicitly to exceptions and exceptions handling.   <br /> <br />The updated items, new topics and chapters and a new look and feel of the text with color coded examples make this book a joy to for C++ programmer to read. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000929AJQ|4.0|This was my very first NIN album. What led me to buy it was curiousity as well as the many articles and interviews that I had read about Trent Reznor. I am a musician myself and I always like to try new things and get \\"out of the box\\" of just one genre.  So I listened to the special streaming that they did of \\"With Teeth\\" on the internet and I absolutely liked the writing that Trent Reznor did.  So of course I bought it the day that it came out.<br /><br />My favorite track is the opening track \\"All The Love In The World\\". Reznor uses electric drum programming at the beginning that gives the track such a unique feel.  After three minutes of programming, Reznor goes on to play a repetitive piano line that later is echoed by the blasting sound of electric guitars with Reznor belting out at the top of his lungs.  There is no way that you can deny his genius.<br /><br />Next, Reznor follows up with a more hardcore \\"Don't You Know What You Are\\".  The chorus moves this song as Reznor repeatedly says \\"Don't you f****** know what you are\\" with the guitars at full dynamics backing him\\".<br /><br />Reznor than moves on to \\"The Collector\\", which isn't as exciting as the first two tracks, but is certainly enjoyable.<br />It is track number four that really stirs your attention. While \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is certainly Reznor's most commercial track, he has no reason to say that he compromised his musical individuality.  This track is rocking hard no matter what.  Only a musical genius can make a track that is not only commercial but also satisfying to himself as a musician.<br /><br />\\"With Teeth\\" isn't as good as \\"All The Love in The World\\", \\"Don't You Know What You Are\\", or \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", but it is a decent track.  What is unfortunate is the fact that like most title tracks, it doesn't live up to be a great, great track.  \\"Only\\" is probably my favorite next to \\"All The Love In The World\\".  It has a great groove going with it along with Trent Reznor's signature writing. The rest of WITH TEETH has its enjoyable listens along with some unremarkable material.  The True hits are at the beginning with a few tracks following towards the latter half of the album.  With that said, WITH TEETH is Trent Reznor's masterpiece, and it is a well put together one at that.  Find out \\"what you are\\" by buying NINE INCH NAIL'S must buy WITH TEETH.  I highly recommend it. 4 stars.s enjoyable listens along with some unremarkable material.  The True hits are at the beginning with a few tracks following towards the latter half of the album.

B000002GQG|4.0|The Moodies did something very interesting with this release. They moved away from the orchestral flavor of 'Days' and learned how to play sitar and other eastern instruments for this one. They played more than 30 different instruments collectively, while adopting the Mellotron as their new found expression. This album deals with a 'Search' for truth, or life, or something. oh, the lost chord, that's it! The sound is somewhat eastern and mystical (The Word/OM) as well as very accessible (Ride my See-Saw, Voices in the Sky). The Ode to Tim Leary (Legend of a Mind) is O.K., but an overrated tune IMHO. Nearly everything else is better than it. As with every Moodies album in their catalog(ue), this one is a 'must hear'.
B000002L5P|5.0|Unlike their more coherent subsequent albums the Smiths debut comes through more as a singles collection than anything else.But when the said singles are of the caliber of\\"This Charming Man\\",\\"What Difference does it make?\\"(hands down my favorite Smiths composition) or \\"Hand in Glove\\" words like coherence and flow barely seem to matter.<br /><br />Some of the stuff may even qualify as filler(like \\"Suffer little children\\") and here also lies what has to be their weirdest song-the punky,falsetto laden yet undeniably entertaining\\"Miserable Lie\\".But as always with Morrissey and Marr's gang any slip up or lack of focus is widely  made up for with the sparkling quality of the overwhelming majority of their reportoire,here highlighted by material as unarguably sensational as \\"Pretty Girls make Graves\\" or \\"Still Ill\\".
0060234814|5.0|Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles.  Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. <br /> <br />From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel.  I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants.  I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia. <br /> <br />The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author.  Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|The first time I listened to \\"Lullabies\\" was on an 11-hour flight to London so I had plenty of time to relax and let the music sink in.  After my first listen, I couldn't believe what I had heard.  The album seemed so boring and slow.  After so much excitement from hearing Little Sister, I was incredibly disappointed.  Yet I wanted to give it another shot.  So I did, and I ended up listening to the album at least 15 times during my one week stay in Oxford.<br /><br />It's now my favorite QOTSA album.  I used to think Rated R was their best, because it had the most diversity but I just think Lullabies is a more cohesive album, and a creepy one at that.  It definitely has a grotesque, nightmarish quality to it.  I really can't get enough of it.  I was too quick to write it off, but it gets better with each listen.  Favorite song: The Blood Is Love.<br /><br />For the full experience, listen to it in the darkest room you can find with a good pair of headphones.  Mind blowing.
B0002858YS|3.0|The Killers are definitely a group deserving the recognition of which they are building as of late.  \\"MR. BRIGHTSIDE\\" is a ubiquitous music video on both VH1 as well as MTV.  \\"SOMEBODY TOLD ME\\" was a great musical adventure as well. The sound of which the Killers produce is definitely of a resurgence of the 1980s.  The neat thing about the Killers is that they aren't afraid to add synth sounds to enhance the arrangement and give it that 80s quality.  They are definitely a band to watch out for.<br /><br />HOT FUSS was definitely deserving of the Grammy Nominations that they received, just as FRANZ FERDINAND was as well.  But in a way, HOT FUSS falls into the same trap as FRANZ FERDINAND did.  Both are equally good albums, but they're other tracks don't turn out to be as remarkable as they're lead singles.  While \\"Andy You're A Star\\" is a top track pick & \\"Jenny Was A Friend of Mine\\" was good as well, the other tracks just sort of give you a filler filling compared to the masterpiece quality of the best tracks.<br /><br />Brandon Flowers is  a good vocalist, but listening to the album all the way through, it may grate on you slightly after a while considering his vocal style is different than that of other bands that are out. As I said before, this is a band to watch out for. While HOT FUSS does has it low points (very few albums don't)they are still a very credible group and one who will have a great degree of sucess.
B000002GQE|4.0|This is the 1st MB release with Justin and John as members of the band. I think it's safe to say that without J & J, we would be saying stuff like...\\"the Moody who's?\\" This one album guaranteed that we would remember. Every once in a while an artist makes art that is timeless. The Moodies did just that in 1967 with the release of their critically acclaimed 'Days of Future Passed'. There is something for everyone here. The songwriting and storytelling aspect is unique and believable. The music segues from theme to theme seamlessly. Sometimes soaring, sometimes rocking, always appealing to our sense of the truth. Days is the defining Moodies release - if you like it you'll probably like most of their stuff. A day in the life of 'everyman' put to music, prose and song. The cross-fades and segues weave a tale worth hearing, a tale that is still applicable today - nearly 40 years later.
B000286RKW|5.0|I'm not really into these \\"Mob Films\\", but GoodFellas was quite interesting, and it's not because it has a bunch of actors I like in it. Anyone that hasn't seen it already needs to see it. Even if you're not into mob movies, you'll still enjoy it.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's self-titled, debut album was the definitive rock album of the 1990s and, more than any other album from its time, has influenced the mainstream rock genre as it flows through the airwaves today. Although Rage's influence on the evolution of rock music has generally been overlooked and understated by critics, if one were to analyze the current state of rock music, he/she would be hard pressed to argue that it could still be what it is today without Rage. <br /> <br />Rage spawned the rap/rock revolution (for better or worse), infused rock music with intelligent social and political commentary at a time when the genre was severely lacking it, and helped rock music evolve to its current state. Listen to the entire album once, all the way through, and you will see why. An amazing band, with amazing musicianship, lyricism, and insight, Rage should go down in history as one of the most influential rock bands of its generation, although it seems as though the scope of its influence may always be overshadowed by other deserving bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Regardless, what's most important is that the music will always be there for us to enjoy, and the music can never lie. <br /> <br />Trust me and the others who have taken the time to express their opinions on this album -- if you are a true fan of rock music, you owe it to yourself to own this album.
B0000630BT|5.0|SADLY, THIS IS THE LAST AND THE BEST WORK OF JUDAS PRIEST..... <br /> <br />BUT ALSO, THE OTHER ONE IS 2-DISC SET \\"METAL WORKS\\" WHICH IS A COMPILATION & IS A VERY GOOD COLLECTION OF SONGS FROM THE ALBUMS TILL PAINKILLER... <br /> <br />I HIGHLY RECOMEND THE OTHER DVD BY THEM TITLED \\"JUDAS PRIEST-ELECTRIC EVE\\"
B000089CJI|5.0|This cd isn't the best cd I have ever heard but is still very good. To be honest I like more DCFC but they are still one of the best music bands on these days of bad , overrated, and unoriginal music. The combination bewtween the electronic beats and the voice of the singer is great and sometimes beautiful soundscapes result in their songs. My personal favorites are Nothing Better and Brand New colony, please check the lyrice of nothing better, they are just amazing and the way the singer combines with the woman to sing the song together is awesome. This cd is worth your money and really deserves serious attention. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|An awesome album and a must have for any radiohead fan. Requires more than 3 listens to be fully appreciated, but after that it will fill you with awe. It holds your attention from the marvellous opener \\"airbag\\" to the joyous ride of the \\"tourist\\" You must own this album. This is one of my favourite albums of all time and with good reason, it is truly the greatest album of all time.
0060958324|5.0|The search for a greater understanding, greater meaning than what you see on the surface, is something that many men have but few men actually undertake, and fewer yet find what they are looking for. An ideal first step to becoming one of the individuals that makes an effort to go on this search is to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. One of the deepest, most profound works ever written, the book takes you on a journey of a who that searches so deeply into the mind that he eventually loses his, and takes on the personality of the narrator. The narrator then goes on a journey with his son, Chris, to discover a greater understanding of what his alter-ego, Phaedrus, was looking for. Along the way, we ponder deep, philosophical questions, most notably \\"What is quality?\\" and the split between the underlying function of things and what they appear to be on the outside (classic vs romantic).  The ideas to be sparked, the questions to be asked further, and the deeper and deeper levels of the mind to be pondered after reaading this work will go on for thousands of years. Take advantage of your mind, go deeper, and explore the intidmitating, yet glorious possibilities.
B00005JKHP|1.0|<br />most interesting part of movie:I honestly cant think of any. <br /> <br /> <br />Why is it that when I watch this movie I can think of several star trek episodes which could have been redone to take it's this movies place??
B000069AUI|4.0|This CD is one of my all time favorite's! I wouldn't say it breaks new ground, but it certainly digs a little deeper into its genre. Chris Martin is an fantastic frontman for Coldplay and his vocals are amazing! The entire CD is filled with excellent songs, but here are a few highlights: <br /> <br />\\"Polotik\\". My  second favorite song on the CD. <br />It starts out loud with banging drums, but halfway through, it switches to a soft, two minute instumental with heartmoving piano playing by Martin. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Scientist\\". My favorite of the CD. <br />A haunting ballad of love, loss and forgiveness. <br />The piano is extraordinary!  <br /> <br />Overall, the CD is never boring and I can listen to it all the way through without skipping any tracks. <br /> <br />At times its quiet and refelctive, or loud and incredible. <br /> <br />Chris Martin, Will Champion, John Buckland and Guy Berryman are truely geniuses of our time. <br /> <br />I cannot wait to get their new CD and I am definetly going to atten their concert in September. <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|I found the new Audioslave cd to be a great piece of art any musician would be happy to have produced.  It has its hard driving moments as well as its subtler moments.  What comes across loud and clear however is that these guys are group of talented musicians who have paid their dues and refined their style over time.  In a music world where increasingly overproduced music is feed to the masses suffering from  a.d.d. Audioslave forces you to really listen to appreciate it.  If you appreciate the hard driving stuff of the first album or are looking for something more reminiscent of both bands past you will find it in bits and pieces.  Anyone familiar with the histories of either band will realize this is a perfect blend of two styles.  I don't think any other singer would have pushed this band the way Chris has and vise versa.  Just buy it and listen to it a few times then complain if you must but don't deny the artistry.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|For me this album represents a big decline in the quality of writing from Dream Theater. The songs although chock full of heavy riffs, unisons and time sig shifts seem to lack any direction and to my ears end up sounding like a collection of riffs. The lack of distinct clear melodic hooks is also very disapointing...I've always enjoyed Dream Theater above other prog/metal bands because of their ability to fuse interesting harmonic ideas, blistering technicality with soaring melodies but here, the melodic aspects are sadly missing.  <br /> <br />Technically the playing is immaculate as always, John Petrucci (Guitars) really goes for the throat on this disc (personally I prefer his more melodic playing). Everything is tight and accurate and the production is great - the bass is more audible than previous releases. If you like your prog on the heavier side of the spectrum theres lots to interest you here, otherwise you may be well advised to check out some of the bands earlier releases - \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance\\".
B000002MP2|5.0|This album is great, and there is no denying it. While to some, American Idiot was \\"the sellout album\\" of Green Day. To others, those fans who have followed Green Day from their underground years.. Dookie is \\"the sellout album.\\" <br /> <br />Comparing Dookie to American Idiot, the songs are a little more real. American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are both OK songs, they just repeat and repeat. While songs like When I Come Around, Burnout, and most of the other songs on Dookie are good songs, with out repeat the title about a zillion times in a row. Though, there is a certin hidden track that... oh have I said too much?
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This album is a disgrace to prog music- it should be in the metal section, not prog
B0007Y08IS|3.0|After the Jackass movie, this is the rudest, crudest, most offensive, profane thing I have ever seen get an \\"R\\" rating. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I'm all for freedom of speech, and parts of this were downright hilarious and quite clever - still, just not sure where we're headed as a society and not crazy about the idea of kids watching this thing (I mean, who are we kidding, the R rating means diddly squat - I'm sure half the 13 year old boys in the country have seen this movie by now).  I guess we can laugh while our culture flushes down the toilet... <br /> <br />If nothing else, I must admire the courage of creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone - I'm sure dismembering, burning alive, shooting, chopping, impaling, exploding the heads of and otherwise slaughtering puppets representing most of Hollywood Royalty REALLY made them popular guys out in Hollywood.  This movie also gives a big F.U. to political correctness.  That my friends, is sheer guts.   <br /> <br />They've got brass ones - I'll hand them that - and obviously don't give a f##k who they p!ss off.  Good for them.  Now, if they could just tone down the vulgarity...
B00097DX3U|4.0|This album is marvelous, but at first I was  a little dissapointed. From their self-entitled album, I would throw it in my deck and hear the hard drums and shredding guitar on \\"Cochise\\" I was hoping for a mimic of just that, so when I heard a lighter, softer tune, I was sad to say it, but dissapointed. But then I listened the the album again and realized, yeah the vocals, guitar and drums may be a step down in rocking out, but the lyrics, the strings and beats were more advanced. And thats the first sign of a good band, whether they are able to progress into something bigger and better. Which they have done, no doubt, with this album. Besides if you want the music from the first album, why not just listen to the first album? I am very pleased with whats been created by the formation fo two great bands, and by the way... where else are you going to hear a voice like Chris Cornell? Exactly, pick this cd up, you won't be dissapointed
078322608X|5.0|With 250 reviews of this dvd I find myself with little to add in praise of 12 Monkeys. However, I would like to mention Frank Gorshin's stylish performance as Dr. Fletcher. I'm sure it's been mentioned elsewhere, but in case you do not know, Frank Gorshin was best known for playing the Riddler in the 1960's television series Batman. Sci-fi fans might also remember him as Commissioner Bele from an episode of the original Star Trek series.  <br /> <br />Gorshin, a magnificent character actor, died May 17, 2005 and he will be sorely missed. 12 Monkeys just wouldn't be the same film without him.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator soars as it captures the most glorious slice of the life of Howard Hughes, the filmmaker, aviation innovator, and mentally unstable billionaire. The movie has an easier time with its subject matter, because Hughes lived a flamboyant life. By age 25, he filmed Hollywood's then most expensive movie. He wined, dined, and presumably slept with many leading ladies of the day, including Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, and of course, Katherine Hepburn. Where Hughes took his real risks, though, was in aviation. He was a brilliant technical innovator and a business visionary. Whether designing and flying test planes for the Air Force, building the first coast-to-coast airlines, or challenging a congressionally-proposed monopoly on international flight, Hughes did everything in a huge way. Leonardo DiCaprio, as Hughes, captures the dashing and erratic Hughes with the same boldness as Hughes lived the first part of his life. DiCaprio's intensity as a man driven by his obsessions drew me into the movie immediately. When he mentally calculates whether he can buy TWA, you accept it as a foregone conclusion. When he flies an experimental plane at 352 MPH, you're grinning as widely as Hughes. When he dates Katherine Hepburn, there was no doubt that fiery \\"Katie\\" had met her match. And when he publicly confronts a corrupt senator, all you see is Howard Hughes spitting fire. DiCaprio perfectly captures Hughes' growing mental illness, too, along with his horror at a disease that is engulfing him. When he began to obsess about cleanliness, I tensed, not wanting this great, young man to begin the slide into insanity. Every time he overwashed his hands, recoiled at a speck of dirt on a suit, and opened a doorknob with a Kleenex, my jaw clenched as I silently urged him to pull out of the grip of his illness.  This was a masterpiece. <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|The only downside of KBV1, if there is one, is that absent from the movie is Bill himself, played by David Carradine.      That scene in KBV2, where he's making the sandwiches as he has that deep discussion with our heroine is incredible.  I have never in my LIFE seen someone make a sandwich with such ease - or have a more carefully laid out assortment of sandwich fixins'. You KNOW what I'm talkin' `bout!      It brought a tear to my eye.  In terms of effortless, graceful, mayo spreading and sandwich making, it stands as one of the greatest scenes ever.  I wish Tarantino had more \\"sandwich scenes\\" in his movies.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I'd like to review the whole concept of this band. I chose to put my review here, because this record is the most horrible example of their muzak. <br /> <br />Yes I can hear that you guys are great players and I know you have gratuaded from a music school. I think that won't explain why you still lack imagination (\\"omg, we have a problem. We need to add twenty-one minutes to this song. I can't come up with anything... hey Petrucci, why don't you masturbate with your guitar for ten minutes and the others will show their enormous technical skills for ten minutes, and then we have the chorus again?\\") and dynamics? Why have you to drop out the last 1/8 of every bar to make the 4/4 riff go in 7/8, so it would be progressive? Maybe the emotion-lacking and uninnovative noise is not the issue - but the lack of DYNAMICS. Listen to Camel's Echoes. Now that is the best song ever made. The best thing is that there are quiet parts which are really quiet and louder parts which are really louder. It keeps the tension and attention going on and doesn't just bore your ears and make the music sound like a pot of porridge. It seems you think that dynamics in music is just about using a clean sound with some chorus when you want to play a softer part and then switch it to a really huge and compressed distortion when you want to rock.  <br /> <br />And how have you never heard of nuances? When you repeat this extremely hard 11/8 riff, which is just a 12/8 riff Mike Portnoy came up with while taking the [&*!#] and finally you decided to drop this last eight off because it would otherwise sound like pop music and too commercial, yes, you repeat it let's say, like, ten times, every time with the same [%*!#]ing way and same [%*!#]ing volume, so it would be reaaally boring. Oh, I forgot, it's metal music! Well, metal with its all original rawness and loudness is suitable for shorter songs, 3-4 minutes - longer ones need some kind of quieter passages and stuff borrowed from other styles or the listener would just be exhausted. LISTENING TO DREAM THEATER OR OVERLONG METAL MUSIC IN GENERAL IS JUST LIKE READING A VERY LONG TEXT IN ONLY CAPITAL LETTERS AND WITHOUT ANY PUNCTUATIONS YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T REALLY GET THE IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON AND YOU CAN'T FOLLOW THE TEXT INTENSELY FOR A LONG TIME WELL THIS IS NOT JUST WITH THIS KIND OF MUSIC IT IS A TREND WHEN MASTERING A CD TO OVERCOMPRESS THE MUSIC TOO [%*!#]ING LOUD SO IT CAN BE AS LOUD AS OR LOUDER THAN THE OTHER SONGS COMING FROM THE RADIO SO PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER THEIR SONGS BETTER BUT WITH DREAM THEATER I THINK THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE, THEY COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT WAY

B0001ADAVK|4.0|After accepting a job at the ultra conservative Wellesley women's college in the 1950s, West Coast art professor Julia Roberts finds herself among the brightest and the best, but the terminally unambitious. Getting their \\"MRS\\" degrees seems to be the goal of her students, not changing the world, not taking charge of their destiny. This rubs her the wrong way, but her attempts to \\"enlighten\\" the women results in her being called subversive and puts her on the short list for termination. The characters may be stereotypes, but they are convincing.  It was an enjoyable movie.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Before I start, I would like to state the only reason I am giving this cd a five star rating is that it's because it is quite possibly the finest rock and pop music ever written. However, if I were to judge this cd on quauntity rather than quality, this would be a one star cd.<br /><br />\\"The Beatles 1\\" is a collection of all 20 of their American singles as well as seven that went to number one in Britain. While it's no lie that these songs are classics, but really, exactly how many times does this stuff have to be rereleased before everyone is tired of The Beatles?<br /><br />The burning question is, why don't The Beatles have their own boxed set? I mean, seriously, they are the most important band that ever existed, and yet they haven't gottent their own seven or even eight disc best of with all their hits and the classics that weren't. That's a sin. It would probably take years to put together, but for The Beatles, it would be worth it. I actually came up with my own track lisitng for it. If I actually had all the cds, I'd probably make it on iTunes. Here it is:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />1)I Want To Hold Your Hand<br />2)She Loves You<br />3)Please Please Me<br />4)I Saw Her Standing There<br />5)My Bonnie<br />6)From Me To You<br />7)Twist And Shout<br />8)Can't Buy Me Love<br />9)All My Loving<br />10) Do You Want To Know A Secret<br />11) Thank You Girl<br />12) There's A Place<br />13) Love Me Do<br />14) P.S.

B00005B36H|5.0|Himo Phnen, you are the biggest \\"tool\\" on the net. All you do is write asinine reviews reflecting your worthless hypocritical pseudo-christian beliefs. Maybe if you weren't such a loser and blinded by your so-called \\"faith\\" you could take some of that negative energy and direct it toward something positive-although judging by your 20 or so pages of nonsensical reviews you will be content to jerk yourself to sleep every night for the rest of your pathetic life. 1500+ reviews of this album still yields 4.5 stars (which really should be 5 stars) despite your attempt to make a difference in swaying someone's decision away from buying this album.  Kill yourself now. Someone else needs the oxygen you're wasting. <br /> <br />Now that's out of the way- I can't say anything that countless people have said before- this album is an experience from the artwork to the many sounds and transitions this album has in store for you from the minute you press play.  Every listen you will notice something different even after hearing it time and time again. The lyrics are deeply rooted in Maynard's world which are an adventure to decipher.  I've owned this album for many years and still enjoy the occasional listen.  I don't believe that you need to be some sort of intellectual to enjoy Tool's music- but give it a chance...you might be surprised. <br /> <br />This album DESERVES 5 stars.
0156907399|3.0|\\"He would pick a flower for her, lend her his books. But could he believe that Minta read them? She dragged them about the garden, sticking in leaves to mark the place.\\"<br /><br />In my attempt to understand Virginia Woolf's life, it would seem appropriate to read more of her work and understand how she viewed life in its beauty and horror. In To the Lighthouse there are brief glimpses of beauty in regards to nature, feelings and experience. Yet, the underlying emotion in this book seems to be a subtle frustration. The frustration of the reader attempting to stay focused and connected with the main themes and the frustration of the young James Ramsay, who only wishes to visit a lighthouse.<br /><br />\\"Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down.\\"<br /><br />Virginia Woolf's descriptions can at times appear as vivid recollections and there is almost a tension at the start as if at any moment a scene of emotional instability will break and the characters will fall apart. Yet, they remain calm in their own insecurities, never really drawing on our sympathies. A child dreams, a mother hopes, a husband tries to dash both the dreams and hopes.<br /><br />Then Virginia seems to be stepping in an out of her characters lives, experiencing little nuances of their existence. This results in a swirling of temporary chaos as you try to find your way out of the emotional complexity and sometimes overwhelming lists of people she introduces briefly. Only a few characters remain until the end and many of the temporary characters fly in and out of the story so fast, we can't quite grasp the importance of their introduction.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book seems to be when the house starts to fall apart and is then rescued from the encroaching decay, swollen sea-moistened woodwork and rusting hinges.<br /><br />Some movies are better when viewed the second and third time and it seems this book gains a new clarity on the second reading. In the end I was disappointed not to learn about James' impressions of the final destination and honestly wished she had spent more time on the main characters. In the end it feels like bits and pieces all connected in some jigsaw puzzle of experience.<br /><br />If you love the sea and lighthouses, there are short moments of pleasure and the descriptions cause you to lose track of reality for minutes at a time. I did love the description of a star sliding in the sky and then the entire sea lighting up in red and gold. In her writing she seems to have the ability to paint pictures of the inner world in memorable ways.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewhen rescued from the encroaching decay, swollen sea-moistened woodwork and rusting hinges.

B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is without a doubt, along with Cher and Diana Ross, the reigning queen of pop music. And unfortunately, the queen has yet to get a proper retrospective released. However, 1990's \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" still holds up pretty well, dated as it may be.<br /><br />The majority of Madonna's hits from 1983 to 1990 are here, including \\"Holiday\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Vogue\\". They also included some less fondly remembered numbers like \\"Open Your Heart\\" (which had a memorably controversial video) and \\"Cherish\\" (my favorite Madonna song). This collection also included (when it was issued in 1990) two strong new singles, the number one hit \\"Justify My Love\\" (whose video was banned from MTV and parodied hilariously on \\"Wayne's World\\" on \\"Saturday Night Live\\").<br /><br />As I said earlier, however, Madonna has yet to have a proper collection of her best material. Thsi collection, as enjoyable as it may be, leaves out such hits from this period as \\"Angel\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", the number one single \\"Who's That Girl\\", \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\". My idea for a Madonna best of would be a two disc set containing most if not all of her chart hits up to today. I can see it now: \\"Madonna: The Definitive Collection\\". Here is what the track list would look like:<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />Holiday<br /><br />Borderline<br /><br />Lucky Star<br /><br />Like A Virgin<br /><br />Material Girl<br /><br />Crazy For You<br /><br />Angel<br /><br />Dress You Up<br /><br />Live To Tell<br /><br />Papa Don't Preach<br /><br />True Blue<br /><br />Open Your Heart<br /><br />La Isla Bonita<br /><br />Who's That Girl<br /><br />Causing A Commotion<br /><br />Like A Prayer<br /><br />Express Yourself<br /><br />Cherish<br /><br />Oh Father<br /><br />Keep It Together<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />Vogue<br /><br />Hanky Panky<br /><br />Justify My Love<br /><br />Rescue Me<br /><br />This Used To Be My Playground<br /><br />Erotica<br /><br />Deeper And Deeper<br /><br />Bad Girl<br /><br />Rain<br /><br />I'll Remember<br /><br />Secret<br /><br />Take A Bow<br /><br />Human Nature<br /><br />You'll See<br /><br />You Must Love Me<br /><br />Don't Cry For Me Argentina<br /><br />Frozen<br /><br />Ray Of Light<br /><br />The Poweer Of Goodbye<br /><br />Beautiful Stranger<br /><br />American Pie<br /><br />Music<br /><br />Don't Tell Me<br /><br />What It Feels Like For A Girl<br /><br />Die Another Day<br /><br />American life<br /><br />I understand that if they release a collection like this many songs will be edited and maybe one or two minor hits would be excluded (perhaps \\"Rain\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\", although I really like both of those songs), but for an artist like Madonna, it would be worth it. Until then, \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is without a doubt worth the money.re <br />You'll See <br />You Must Love Me <br />Don't Cry For Me Argentina <br />Frozen <br />Ray Of Light <br />The Poweer Of Goodbye <br />Beautiful Stranger <br />American Pie <br />Music  <br />Don't Tell Me <br />What It Feels Like For A Girl <br />Die Another Day <br />American life <br /> <br />I understand that if they release a collection like this many songs will be edited and maybe one or two minor hits would be excluded (perhaps \\"Rain\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\", although I really like both of those songs), but for an artist like Madonna, it would be worth it.

B000003C4K|5.0|This is a great cd and a must have for any thrash fan.  This cd is, in my opinion, better than early Metallica.  Exodus came out during the Bay Area Thrash boom and have owned ever since. <br />Their first album is like a piece of metal history, the guitar work is sweet, the lyrics are brutal and angry and the vocals are excellent. <br />Buy this album...

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you don't like this album, you're not playing it loud enough.  There, i've said it.   <br />It's music with energy people.  It keeps you on your toes and changes tempo a million times!!!  No one song really stands out, and, sure, some of the tracks aren't \\"radio friendly\\" but they will grow on you if you aren't close minded to progressive music. <br />THIS COCAINE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM ON THIS SONG <br />To clarify, it's not progressive music, it's fun music.  you won't know what to think the first time through, but once you listen to it a few times, even the songs you thought you didn't like: you will find yourself head bobbing (thrashing, really)/air drumming/singing along to.  You just have to get used to the switches and crazy tempos.  Any way about it, the more you listen, the faster your heart goes.  Beats the hell out of coffee in the morning.  Plus if you play it loud enough and you look like you're \\"enjoying\\" it in your car, people WILL get out of your way.  Good stuff.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I love this movie, but am not going to purchase it on DVD until it comes out in widescreen. I'm sure I'm not the only customer who feels this way.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Ive been reading some of these reviews- and the 5 star reviews a few below does not make sence at all- he said \\"True its not some of their best stuff\\" SO WHY GIVE IT 5 STARS????????? ruins your review---stop there- SCENES and AWAKE- are 4/5 star albums- dont rank this one with them--geez
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I love this new album.  Sure, some of the lyrics are unclear and don't make sense.  But, this to me is what makes it good, because they do make sense once you go underneath and find out what they mean.  I have noticed many people having a problem with Daron singing more on this album.  I like it, it brings System to a whole new level.  Also, he has the right to sing, he wrote and helped write 10 out of the 11 songs on the cd.  The only song Serj wrote the lyrics to on his own was Question!.  Daron wrote lyrics on 4 songs.  So all the people that say they don't like him singing.  He has the right.  I love System and I love this album.  I can't wait for hypnotize.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has sold 1.3 million copies of her wonderful album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi.\\" She is currently #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with her smash hit \\"We Belong Together.\\" Her 16th #1 to be exact. Mariah is breaking records and defying expectations. She is solidifying her place in history as one of the greatest singers ever. Thanks to great production and songwriting, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" will surely stand out as one of her best. Hopefully, this is just the beginning of another great run.
B000002H6C|5.0|These days many teens like myself criticize Metallica. Why? Because  after 1988's releasing of ...And Justice For All, Metallica took a leap into commercialized garbage. This is proven especially with St. Anger, the latest release and a mix of random, unrelated songs.  These days teens like myself aren't exposed to Metallica's four greatest works. Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All were all milestones in metal history. <br /> <br />...And Justice For All is, though poorly recorded compared to Master of Puppets, my favorite Metallica album, and perhaps my favorite album of all time behind Megadeth's Rust in Peace and Peace Sells But Who's Buying albums. From start to finish this album blows your mind, leaving you wide-eyed completely by the time you reach the end of Dyers Eve (the final track).
0140177396|3.0|The book \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was about two men that had been chased out of their old town. They are sent out to find a new job so they can fulfill their dream of having their own land. When something goes wrong at the ranch, Lennie must hide out until George comes back to get him.  Lennie ends up killing the bosses' sons' wife which leads to an unforgettable twist that will shock you. I really enjoyed the book. The only thing I didn't like was there were a few boring parts that described the scenery but there's a reason for that. this book if for young adults because of the Aurthors writting style. I like this book because it makes you think and you have to remember everything you read.
B00005JKC3|5.0|This is a complex, sophisticated film and one that most closely captures the essence of the Hulk comic.  True comics fans who love the individual character development and the art first and find the violent action a delicate garnish should LOVE this movie.  I wouldn't be surprised that these true fans also dislike the Batmans, daredevils, catwomans as these are horrible schlock that pervert the comic form.  Even Spiderman and X-men, while paying tribute, do not quite capture the spirit.  The best true comic book movies to date are not even Marvel or DC:  Sin City (but its graphic novel style) and Unbreakable.   Hulk is the best of the the DC/Marvel crowd to date  for those of us who were buying the phoenix series, electra and captain marvel fresh off the shelves...true believers.  It also beautifully sets up sequels, but it is clearly above the heads of the average moviegoer and tragically appropriate sequels may not get made.  Reminds me of 1990 when these morons were shelling out $100 a ticket for phil collins and aerosmith when they could see the pixies, jane's additiction, nirvana, soundgarden...etc almost free in local clubs.   Same thing happening today with U2/Coldplay/Radiohead etc. when bands like Cold Duck Complex are there in small clubs for the taking.  Go figure.
B00004WF68|5.0|The British version of this CD is called \\"Mr Fantasy\\" - it has a superior CD sleeve to the US version, but a lot of it is in badly mixed mono and sounds very flat.  The same album is available in the US version under the title \\"Heaven is In Your Mind\\" - it is all in stereo, and sequenced much better - makes a BIG difference - and is far superior to the U.K. version.  Both versions are great - whichever one you end up with, you're gonna love if you like psychedelic music!  Because this album is a psych CLASSIC!  I have both versions and I ALWAYS listen to the US version (\\"Heaven is In Your Mind\\") because it sounds better and makes more sense the way it is sequenced. I had never even heard of the album until 1 year ago.  I investigated this year, and I am SURE GLAD I did!!!
B00079ZACM|3.0|There is no question that this is a classic film. It is exciting, spectacular, and features some of England's finest acting talent. However, the DVD transfer is far from satisfying. In fact,it is so mediocre, that one of the reviewers thought it was a colorized version!<br />This film deserves better treatment. Filmed in Technicolor,the color registers are off much of the time, and the brightness rises and falls within many of the scenes.<br />Hopefully, a restored version will be released to preserve this wonderful film in something close to its original glory. The Criterion Collection comes to mind. Considering some of the garbage they've preserved lately, it's about time they got around to a classic like \\"The Four Feathers\\".<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/9/11<br />Well, I guess if you wish long enough, your wish might come true. It appears that the Criterion Collection is going to release a Blu-Ray version of this classic film on October 11. I for one will immediately pre-order it.
0142000663|4.0|The story unfolded with a vivid depiction of the state of Oklahoma land. Weather was scorchingly hot and dry, land was parched and harvests were unsatisfactory. To the Joad family, their livelihood, well-being, families, and happiness - in short, their everything - all hinge on the cultivation of that piece of land. However, they were forced to move west in search of money and food when their land was taken over by the bank, symbolized by the tractor. The early chapters of the book hence gave a poignant portrayal of the encroachment of capitalism on a largely agrarian society and the resulting clash between workers and owners of the land. As the families moved westwards they encountered various problems, such as lack of food, low wages, floods, torrential rains and unreasonable policeman. Yet they did not give up.<br /><br />John Steinbeck ended the story with finesse (I shan't elaborate on this here, lest it spoils your reading experience), further reaffirming the central message of the book - the triumph of human dignity, determination and perseverance. The story did not end with the Joad family making big money, transforming themselves from rags to riches. The writer chose to end it in a more subtle way, leaving room for readers to imagine. `Grapes of Wrath' also paid tribute to motherhood, as Tom Joad's mother rose to become the figure of authority in the family, giving support and charting the direction forward for the family in the later part of the book.<br /><br />I like the way John Steinbeck incorporated detached, short and sweet third person narratives into the story, giving it a fuller and more complete touch. I also fancy the dialogues, and the interplay between the imagery of the environment/weather and the development of the storyline. In all, I enjoyed reading `grapes of wrath'. A very apt metaphoric title indeed, for anger was brewing in the hearts and minds of the migrant family who helped pick the grapes that were in abundance in the orchards, but yet did not get to eat them.<br /><br />P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s. Is the writer trying to mock at capitalism gone wrong? Do segments of the story not sound like a reversal of the American ideals of freedom, liberty and equality? A reflection of the state of American society after the great depression??s, but yet did not get to eat them.  <br /> <br />P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s.

0064471047|4.0|This is the second volume (chronologically) in The Chronicles of Narnia (after The Magician's Nephew, before The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Last Battle).<br /><br />This book takes place during World War II, many years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, and tells the story of four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They are exploring the big house of an old Professor (which I'm guessig is Digory from the first book) where they've been sent during the air-raids, when Lucy enters the old wardrobe in en empty room upstairs to hide in it.<br /><br />Only this wardrobe is actually a direct passage to the world of Narnia, and Lucy finds herself in a forest on a snowy night, the only light that of a lamppost. There she meets a Faun named Tumnus, who is indeed very amazed to meet a legendary Human, an invites her to tea. In the cozy warmth of his home, he tells her of the evil White Witch, who is turning everyone who opposes her to stone, and whose spell on Narnia makes it always winter and never Christmas.<br /><br />When Lucy finally gets out of the wood and then out of the wardrobe again, no time has actually passed, and of course, when she tells her story to her brothers and sister, none of them believes her. Edmund in particular likes to make fun of her.<br /><br />On another, rainy day, when they're all playing hide-and-seek in the huge mansion, Edmund decides to hide in the wardrobe and he too finds himself in Narnia. But instead of the Faun, he meets the White Witch, who lures him with Turkish Delight (his favourite sweets) and by making him believe that he can become King if he brings her his brother and sisters.<br /><br />The book then tells the adventures of the four kids in Narnia, meeting a friendly couple of talking badgers and all kinds of other fantastic animals and creatures, among then the powerful Lion King Aslan, and helping them save the world from the evil usurper Queen.<br /><br />Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think that I would have been more enchanted, amazed and curious about the world of Narnia if I hadn't read all about its creation in the first book. I would have wondered about the lamppost, for example (and it would have been nice to read about the Lion's song later). Knowing about it in advance, I'm sure I found it a tad duller, because I wasn't discovering it at the same time as the kids. This is a nice story, and I know it's a Classic, but I must say it's not as captivating as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I advise you read it in the publication order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; The Last Battle.per Queen. <br /> <br />Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

B00003CXCW|5.0|When I first saw \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" as a teenager (many years ago), I was mesmorized by the power of the movie.  In the years since, I have been surprized that it doesn't rate higher than it does with movie critics.  For a time I thought that I must be unsophisticated in such matters.  However, I have come to conclude that sometimes experts don't know what the heck they're talking about.   <br /> <br />\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" contains all the elements of a great film; great directing, writing, acting, cinematography, and editing.  The directing is top-notch and Billy Wilder is secure enough to let Cecil B. DeMille and Eric von Stroheim play roles in the movie.  This is the movie that convinced me that William Holden is one of the great actors of his era.  Gloria Swanson is outstanding playing the part of a former movie great lost in wealthy obscurity.  The script is top notch and there are many lines from the movie that have found their way into our popular culture.   <br /> <br />The story is about wealth and fame.  On the one hand, Norma Desmond exemplifies the fleeting nature of fame as she plays an old Hollywood starlet whose time has passed.  She was addicted to the spot lights and hasn't been able to understand why it isn't happening any more.  Her wealth is fairly meaningless in her private castle on Sunset Boulevard.  Joe Gillis represents the young man in search of wealth and fame.  His associates and he are working hard to try and get their foot in the door of the movie business.  One wrong turn and Gillis finds that he suddenly has everything without lifting a finger.  One can't handle wealth and fame's depature and the other can't handle its' arrival.   <br /> <br />The story focusses on the two characters and the eerie butler played by von Stroheim.  In the mansion of Ms. Desmond time does not exist.  The past is allowed to be the present as she endlessly relives her fame.  This could have gone on and on but a mistaken message suggests to Ms. Desmond that the movies want her back.  This upsets the balance in her life and she makes a serious reach toward realizing her own version of reality.  Unfortunately everything falls apart and the movie comes to a chilling end. <br /> <br />This is one of the great dramatic films of American cinema.  If you haven't seen it then its' about time.

You have rated there worst CD is good as the first album which is a classic. <br />4. Mezmerize is not anywhere near as good as any of there other albums. <br />5. Its good to know that SOAD can sell out there fans and get great reviews for it. <br />6. The Lead Singer in this album is the guitarist not the lead singer. You cant understand anything that he sings. <br />7. When the real lead singer sings he is to mellow and sounds like has crack stuck in his nose.
B000069AUI|5.0|Hype makes it almost impossible to judge bands because the publicity seeps into one's judgment and becomes the story rather than the actual music. So I took a break from Coldplay for a year and went back to them and I must say their music transcends all the hype. Amsterdam, God Put a Smile on My Face, and my favorite, The Scientist, head the album's charge though you won't find one bad track. Why is Coldplay so successful? Of course, the voice. Of course, the universal themes. Of course, the melodies. But I can't explain why people of all ages love them. It's rare that such a cool band has such mainstream appeal. Many already know that the wonderful band Keane is being, rightly, compared to Coldplay. But for two lesser known bands that have similar melodic\\"emotional rock\\" qualities, check out the Swedish bands Ronderlin and Radio Dept.

0060586230|1.0|This review is for the audio CD version of the novel. I read the book for the first time 20+ years ago. At the time, we lived in a different world. As a teenager, I thought Vonnegut was cool, and I devoured this novel. 20+ years later, I can no longer stomach it. Back when it was hip to bash American and all it stands for, this book seemed important. I can see now that it is not. Don't bother reading this.
B000002UEB|4.0|A long time ago...I was shopping for new music. I am an aggressive CD collector always looking for a CD that will do it for me. I saw this on a new release shelf one day, and it was all new to me. Obviously, not an \\"original\\" fan since they were a local band here in Seattle and I was unaware. But in the 80's, I was looking for something that would just remain in my CD player for a while. <br /> But all things given, this CD is simply a masterpiece. A great story line and superb lyric value and musicianship.  <br /> Buy It! It is not known well, with the exception of the \\"butt Rockers\\", but this is truly a timeless creative work of art. The most aggressive piece of work at that time and it stays the course. This is really a timeless piece of art that will entertain those that listen to the heavier side of music. However, Lyrically, this is simply amazing in story line and overall quality of range in Geoff Tate.  <br /> I look forward to \\"Operation Mindcrime II\\" sometime soon. I just wish it would all come together the same way with Geoff and Chris. I just do not see it being both lyrically and musically amazing without the brilliance of the duo.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now..
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Anyway what happened to real music, this is just a bunch of slapped together riffs, much like all of SOAD's albums with a bunch of lyrics that 50% of the time are gibberish and metphors that dont mean anything. Go buy some real music. Nightrage, inflames, Dream Evil, Killswitch enage, Testament, King Diamond, something anything but this waste of plastic.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Apparently this set has all the same special features as before plus a new scrap book and two episodes of the real ghostbusters cartoon.  i think this could be a release to test the waters for a full fledged real ghostbusters release.  so i think even if you already have the two dvds it is worth 14 dollars too have chance at real ghostbusters box set come out.    I have now heard that it is slimer and the real ghostbusters.  so this isn't as good but still, I think it could be a sign of things to come.  i would probably rate it a four now instead.    Brand new update:  the two episodes are real ghostbuster episodes!!!!  they are citizen ghost and partners in slime.  and they are both definately in widescreen.  id call this review five stars now that it is real ghostbusters.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Yes, I know the last exclamation mark is a 1 <br /> <br />This film has taken its place among my top 3 favorite movies, the first 2 being The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first Pirates of the Carribean movie (they're making a sequel).  <br /> <br />First, let's talk about the music. The music is brought to the grand scale that Andrew Lloyd Webber had always dreamed of, now that it is being played by a full orchestra and not a pit band.  <br /> <br />The production design is extraordinary. I was rooting for the art department to win the Oscar for Best Art Direction. The grand scale of the stage show has been elevated to new heights.  <br /> <br />The treatment of the show itself is excellent. I loved the added touches of backstory and action and mystery. I personally preferred the sword fight in the cemetary because it works better on film than what actually happens on stage (the Phantom throws fireballs.) I also love how Schumacher gave the characters of Madame Giry and Joseph Buquet so much more to do than in the stage version. Frankly, they're just throwaway characters in the stage version but in the movie, we realize what Buquet is all about and we get to see that Madame Giry had a more vital role to play in the Phantom's life. <br /> <br />Now for the cast: <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel and is perfect for the part. She's the right age and has a young, crystalline voice. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler as the Phantom. I don't agree that his singing voice is the best in the world. I know he's not really a trained singer but they could have trained him just a tad harder. Then again, Schumacher did not want a pretty voice for the Phantom. So, I forgive him. To tell the truth, his voice isn't that bad. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson has vocal chords made of gold, which is only right since he has done Broadway. He is perfect as the dashing, romantic, swashbuckling, and somewhat wimpy Raoul. <br /> <br />Minnie Driver is hysterical as La Carlotta (I 'ATE MY 'AT!!!!)It's a pity that she's not really an opera singer.  <br /> <br />Miranda Richardson has an ok singing voice. She also puts on a convincing French accent. I've noticed that Madame Giry is normally the only member of the cast who has to do a French accent. She's less of a throwaway in the movie than in the stage version and more of a driving force. We see that she truly cares about Meg and Christine. So when the new managers are checking the two out, she's like, \\"Don't even think about it!\\" <br /> <br />Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (pronounced KEE-ran HINDS; long I) are hysterical as the two managers (this never happened in the junk business; scrap metal!)I feel that Simon Callow's singing voice rivals Ciaran Hinds by far.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Ellison is a little delight as Meg Giry. And she's the first Meg I've ever heard who can sing. She's so petite and adorable that I thought Kristen Chenoweth was playing the part!  <br /> <br />Victor McGuire as Piangi is wonderfully hammy and henpecked. He has a wonderfully exaggerated tenor which gets crappy in all the right places. (Sad to return to find the la-a-a-and we love). <br /> <br />I still don't understand why that midget was there all the time. <br /> <br />Kevin McNally as Buquet. Well, he's better than the stage Buquet, who was a total throwaway character. At least he has more to do (like trying to catch the Ballet Girls getting dressed) <br /> <br />The makeup on the Phantom was somewhat of a let down. It looked more like he had an encounter with acid as a young child. Then again, in the movie, it's never established that he was deformed from birth, so that may be what happened.  <br /> <br />The guy who played Monsuier Reyer was also funny (UNDERSTUDY!? There is no understudy for La Carlotta!) <br /> <br />Just for the record, the horse in the title song is a homage to the original novel. The Phantom takes Christine to his lair on a horse. <br /> <br />And now the special features:  <br /> <br/>The featurette on the history of the musical was really cool. I especially liked the film clips of the Sydmonton production, the current production in England and clips from the music videos (the British DVD has the full, unedited music videos. Lucky dogs! Oh, well, they've had this show and Andrew Lloyd Webber longer.) <br /> <br />The deleted song, No One Would Listen, is lovely even if it is really the first draft of Learn to Be Lonely.  <br /> <br />It's an awesome film and if the upcoming movie versions of Rent, The Producers, and Dreamgirls once again kill the movie musical which has barely been resurrected by Chicago and Moulin Rouge, this will be a reminder that this generation had its share of movie musicals. What can I say? I'm a sucker for movie musicals. I even liked Man of La Mancha.
B0002OERI0|1.0|And so we have another band that thinks America are evil and power hungry.  Blah Blah Blah we've heard this all before.  We embrace this idea and say \\"Oh they're just making their voice heared\\".  But I KNOW if someone made an album called French Idiot the news will shove that story down our throats.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen!  I don't buy movies, but after renting this one week after week, just because I couldn't get enough of it, I finally bought it.  And, let me tell you, 20-some viewings later, it still doesn't get old!  You probably have to be of the younger MTV generation (under 35) to get the humor, but for those of us that do, this movie rocks!  Gosh!
B00013RC9I|5.0|Air are a French electro-pop duo and this album is an excellent showcase of their immense talents. Their style is dreamy and relaxing.<br /><br />'Cherry blossom girl' is a tender beautiful number with light airy vocals. 'Universal traveller' is another lilting, gentle number, faintly reminiscent of Michael Franks. 'Biological' is a slow, creepy number with half spoken lyrics.<br /><br />The highlight for me are two instrumental numbers; 'Alone in Kyoto', and the brilliant, catchy, 'Alpha beta gaga' with it's whistles, beeps, and lush electronics.<br /><br />If you like this cd, try 'Melody AM by R&ouml;yksopp.
B000002MFN|5.0|To appease the losers at Wal-Mart?  Hello, people, time to stop patronizing neo-Nazi Big Brother to save a few pennies.<br /><br />Madonna has proven her point yet again: That this country is so uncomfortable talking, reading, or even thinking, about sex (which, sorry to report to Wal-Mart, is the way we all got here) that they demand that artists release \\"cleaner\\" versions of their albums.  I wonder if the $18.99 per CD is worth the censorship.<br /><br />This is one of Madonna's best 90's works: She completely reinvented herself here, creating a more funkier beat to fit in with the new decade and showing that, once again, she can keep up with the rest of them.<br /><br />My favorite cut here is \\"Secret Garden.\\"  Yeah, we all know what it's about but the jazzy melody makes it a standout.<br /><br />Loved the video for \\"Bad Girl,\\" about a single woman who finds solace in the bottle and jumping from guy to guy.  \\"Rain\\" is another goody (something tells me she listened to The Beatles song of the same name and decided to come up with her own ditty).<br /><br />\\"Why's It So Hard?\\" is her standard \\"what's wrong that we all can't get along\\" tune.  I like the meaning behind \\"Words\\" (but the video was a bit strange) and \\"Waiting,\\" again, has a good, funky beat.<br /><br />\\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" are two titles that make the know-it-all censors sweat and that's always a good thing.<br /><br />Definitely a must have for all serious Madonna fans (and those who are looking to know her music better).
B000002H6C|5.0|This is metallica's darkest,Heaviest,angriest most pissed off album. Although its a bit unfocused at times its still a great album. It also isnt as solid of an album as their previous releases, but the songs that are good are some of their best. Heres What I think of the songs.    1.Blackened (5/5)- destined too open every metallica concert since its release  2. ...And Justice For All (5/5)- a song about how justice is being overshadowed by greed for money and power, great acoustic intro  3.Eye Of The Beholder (4.5/5)- gets kinda unfocused at the chorus but still great  4.One (5/5)- based on the movie \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" were a soldier loses all his limbs his sight his speach and his hearing, My favorite Metallica song  5.Shortest Straw (3/5)-Nothing Special  6.Harvester Of Sorrows (4/5)- a song about drug dealers ruining peoples lives by selling drugs to them   7.The Frayed Ends Of Sanity (3/5)- Great opening riff but once the singing starts it kinda gets killed  8.To Live Is To Die (3/5)- Mediocre instrumental song  9.Dyers Eve (2/5)-I dont get why so many people like this song, sure you have too be pretty talented too play it but it dosent even sound good    If you like metal check this album out    If you liked this album you might also like:  Pantera- Vulgar Display Of Power  Anthrax- Among The Living  Anthrax- State Of Euphoria  Megadeth- Peace Sells But Whos Buying
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I have been a huge fan of his songwriting and guitar playing since the first Dire Straits debut many years ago.  I felt he and Dire Straits strayed too far from what made them so amazing during the Making Movies and through Brothers In Arms by the time they called it quits.  However, he has proven through these past several years of making solo albums that he has not lost a step.  This album is as good as it gets.  How can someone make an album that is so low key and smooth yet so fresh and original?  It's pure genius when an album that on the surface sounds so, um, adult contemporary (I guess that's the best phrase for this one) can still sound so fresh and new after many listenings.  I 'm guessing it is because Knopfler starts with the essential ingredient in any great album - great songwriting, and keeps the instrumentation to a minimum so the beauty and sophistication of songs can still be appreciated.  Great job, Mark.  Please release a DVD of your current tour in support of this album and please play as mush of your solo stuff as possible and don't feel the pressure to play Sultans & Money just to appease those who only know you for what you did 20+ years ago.  If you must play that band's songs, then be original and daring and choose some of your great songs they don't know, like Industrial Disease or Les Boys!
0312962118|5.0|Snow Wolf is an amazing novel that pictures actual people along with fictional characters. The plot to the story is based on one of the theories of how Josef Stalin really died. It is said that he died of natural causes, but Glenn Meade portrays the theory that Stalin was assassinated by none other than the CIA. Before Eisenhower was sworn into office, he was shown a folder that contained disturbing information about Stalin. The folder said that Stalin was in an unhealthy mental state and was in the concluding state of building a hydrogen bomb that was believed to target the US. The about-to-be President decided to take action on what he read and ordered Operation Snow Wolf to take place, an assassination plot that was to be organized by CIA agent Jake Massey. Massey chose Alex Slanksi and Anna Khorev to follow through with the mission, though Slanski was the only one out of the two to know what they were sent to do; Anna didn't know about the assassination attempt for Stalin. After the mission was in the end of the training phase, the President was informed that the KGB found out about the threat to Stalin's life and set up a hunt for the two operatives. The head of the KGB, a cold and wicked Beria, sent Major Yuri Lukin to assassinate Slanski and Anna.  The operatives go through unnerving obstacles and keep your nose in the book to see how they will outwit the Russians. You are brought into the past as you witness witty escapes and true espionage. You also realize the true connection between Slanki and Lukin as their attempts to end each other's lives comes to a climax. Snow Wolf has a very twisty plot that leaves you wondering and wanting to know what happens next. Me being almost 15, it usually takes me a while to get hooked on a book, but this novel had me hooked after the first part (I must admit, the intro is a little boring, as is the last part). IF you decide to read this book, make sure you aren't doing anything later that day, for the time goes my fast and you won't be able to put it down.d you won't be able to put it down.
067144901X|5.0|I first bought this book for my nephew who is now 17 years old and we loved it so much that I bought it for my baby before he was even born.  It's smart and funny and I don't tire of reading it to my son over and over and over...  In fact, we have it memorized and we'll recite it on car rides to help pass the time.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|THIS ALBUM DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN 3 STARS--- LISTEN YOU'LL BELIEVE ME
B000031XCR|1.0|Celine is a beautiful woman with a lovely natural, if untrained voice, but the style she adopted does not allow for the beauty of lyric or melody to come through at all. Celine has made a name for herself as yet another \\"vocal gymnast\\" who does not believe any song is good enough on it's own. She has to make it somehow \\"spectactular\\" by performing it along with a myriad of screams, yells, and supersonic vocalizations scattered through the melody. This stuff gets old very quickly, especially since Celine is crammed down our throats in every dentist office, Denny's, grocery store and \\"call waiting\\" phone feature.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|It's no surprise that Robert Plant would emerge as one of the last and finest rock singers from the ashes of his time. Anyone like myself who owns all eight Zeppelin albums can tell you that he (and the band) was ahead of their time. Plant's solo work has never really failed either (with maybe the exception of 1985's \\"Shaken 'N' Stirred\\"). So \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" is once again another solid entry in his repertoire.<br /><br />It seems that Plant revisits early Zeppelin here, with a great deal of the songs leaning into rocking blues pieces. I wish Plant had jumped on board with the DualDisc format and done this album in 5.1 surround sound. I think it would have been a great listen. I preferred the first five tracks over the rest of the album. I particularly enjoyed the opening \\"Another Tribe\\" and \\"Freedom Fries\\". \\"Shine It All Around\\" is an okay first single, but I think he should have released a different track first. \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" is great with its quiet menacing tones and Plants obvious jabs at Rod Stewart for doing cabaret (how many more standards albums will he release!!!) \\"All The Kings Horses\\" is a very nice acoustic track with Robert's vocals coming to the front to nice effect.<br /><br />It's around the sixth track, \\"The Enchanter\\" where things become a little boring--but only slightly. On the second half of the disc I enjoyed \\"Dancing In Heaven\\" and \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" best. The hidden track following the short tribute to Ray Charles \\"Brother Ray\\" is a drum 'n' bass version of \\"Shine It All Around\\". It's amusing at first, but it doesn't really fit with the rest of the album and I think at nearly eight minutes, it could have just been left as a b-side or something else.<br /><br />If you bought your copy at Target, like I did, then you get a bonus of an extra track you can access from the internet only. I downloaded it, but it didn't do much for me.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you like Zeppelin and Plant's solo work, this is for you (like me), and even if you are not familiar with all the back catalogue, this is certainly more refreshing than most of the garbage on the radio right now.u are not familiar with all the back catalogue, this is certainly more refreshing than most of the garbage on the radio right now.

B000002UAQ|5.0|Revolver is without a doubt the most statistically and musically the greatest album of all time. For more than one reason. One is that you can literally listen to this album and not skip a song because its not good.You can listen to it the whole way through. Not many albums have achieved that.And second, near the end of the album, you get a sense of musical satisfaction that literally hasnt been achieved since this album or the legandary Dark Side of the Moon. Many say that Sgt. Pepper was the ground breaker for the Beatles and rock. But Revolver was the real groundbreaker. With every song as good as the one before it. I give to you, the Revolutionary, awe inspiring, musically changing, REVOLVER! <br />
0375405380|5.0|There are some books, which leave a lasting impression on you. The kind that you start to miss before you are even done, and then when you finish, you can't read another for a while. This is that kind of book. The story follows a number of people caught up in the various sides of the Drug War, a DEA agent, coke traffickers call girl, mafiosos and a priest. The most compelling part of the story is the humanity of each character. This is not just another book with plot twists-it also makes you feel what each person is feeling. Recommend Highly
B00005JLH3|3.0|Drumline (Charles Stone III, 2002)<br /><br />What so many reviewers have already said about this movie will only be echoed here; for once, pretty much everyone's got it right. There's a lot of extraneous stuff going on in Drumline, and the movie would have benefitted from a far sterner hand in the editing department. The trite, predictable romance and the rebelling-against-authority could have been dispensed with completely, and then we would have been left with the drums.<br /><br />The drums are, of course, the reason to watch Drumline. Band camp as boot camp. Endless practicing. The heat of competition and the struggle to outwit the Smiths, the Joneses, and all other comers. Band not just as an after-school activity, but as an obsession.<br /><br />Would the viewership of the film have been smaller without the silly subplots? It might have been, and the movie might not have gotten the kind of distribution it did if it could be billed as a love story. Ultimately, though, it would have been a better movie. And three years down the pike, those of us who are still watching are watching it for one reason: the drums. So we're back to where we started. ***
B000002BBY|5.0|When I bought this album, I listened to it straight through two times in a row and I was instantly hooked.  This album is perfect, literally perfect. <br />For those who want to rock, turn up \\"Hello\\", \\"Roll With It\\", and \\"What's The Story Morning Glory.\\" <br />For those who want to mellow out, Oasis serves up four classics, \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", \\"Cast No Shadow\\", and \\"Champaign Supernova.\\"  <br />Throw in the amazing \\"Some Might Say\\" and you have a complete and flawless album.  This album defined the 90's and brought the greatness of Britpop over the pond.   <br />Oasis-more than hype, more than attitude.  The greatest rock and roll band on Earth.
B000002J6H|4.0|Stills WAS CSN and CSNY. If not for his musicianship and knowledge of production, the first CSN LP would never have existed. Why do you think even Crosby ans Nash called ``captain Fingers\\". <br />This cd is uneven, but brings together all his influences. <br />Combine this cd with Super Session and you get the full effect of what Stills was abe to do with his guitar. One listen to Season of the Witch on Super Session and it will convince you that Stills was a very underated player. The solo Cd  shows that he was a fisrt rate composer and arranger. <br />Yeah....we all wish that he could turn out another collection that would be on the par of the quyakity of CSN, but those days are gone....thank God we have these recordings tro remind us how good he was.
0784011176|1.0|First of all, <br /> <br />I saw this movie recently again (albeit, grudgingly) and still did not like the subject of the film, but I do have to say that the acting was excellent and I give Jane Campion credit for presenting this story on screen in a unique and stylized way.  That said, all bets are off from that point on. <br /> <br />I don't understand how Holly Hunter's character could adore such a man who is using a piano (the only thing she initially loves and adores) to bribe her for sex.  What exactly is the attraction?  I guess in that time and environment that is the ONLY man that treats her better than her husband.  It's nice to know that times have progressed.  <br /> <br />The story is very sadistic and not the least bit romantic as was attested to by some of my female friends. AND, the setting in the New Zealand rainforest is dreary, gray, sticky and just unpleasant.   <br /> <br />Not likely to view this movie a third time, ever! <br /> <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this movie probably doesn't like much of anything.  It is visually beautiful and full of emotion.  I have the soundtrack of the original play with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman; I also saw the play on Broadway with other actors.  Frankly, I think the movie is better.  Emmy Rossum sings like the innocent she is portraying and her voice is clear and sweet.  Patrick Wilson has a nice tenor and is believable as her young suitor, ready to conquer the world for her. (Loved the hair!!)  However, it is Gerald Butler who steals the show; he should be called the \\"Man of a thousand faces\\" and looks different in every movie I've seen him in.  He freely admitted in an interview that he's not a singer; in fact, he had to take a crash course in vocalizing to sing the part.  Given that bit of information, I think he did a fine job and his acting is superb. The only complaint is that it must have been hard to make him look bad, given his Scottish good looks. I was rooting for the Phantom for most of the movie, and I wouldn't mind if he wanted to lock me up in his dungeon. He is extremely seductive in the part, and I can't think of anyone in Hollywood who could have done a better job. With his mask, the Phantom is powerful, commanding, fearsome and magical.  Without it, he is like most of the rest of us in the world--weak, vulnerable, and emotionally fragile.  Minnie Driver was a bit of comic relief, as were the 2 owners of the opera, who made a fortune in \\"scrap metal\\" (junk). So far, I have watched the DVD 5 times since I got it, and I reach for the tissues at the end every time.  I loved this movie!!!
B00097DX3U|3.0|Audioslaves debuet album was amazing. I had doubts it'd work becuase i can't stand chris cornell's voice, but knowing tom morello and the rest of rage were involved i decided to give it a listen. I was blown away, so without hesitating i bought out of exile. When i popped the cd in i was expecting the same metal that made their first album so awesome. What i heard was a failed attempt at trying to make the group a rock band. There are only a handful of songs worth listening to and that's why i gave the cd 3 stars. Morello's guitar playing made rage big and helped make audioslave big, so they made the smart move to can some of his guitar solos! Instead of hearing a nasty guitar solo we're treated to chris cornell's wailing. There's no good metal groups, so this cd is a must for music starved metal heads, but if you aren't a big audioslave fan, then avoid this album.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|There are so many adjectives I could use to describe this album, but no single one captures the essence of this perfect album.<br /><br />It is rare for me to want to listen to an album from front to back, but this one has me held hostage!  I can't listen to anything else!<br /><br />Since when has a band mixed death-metal, pop, polka, and politics into a #1 album? I dare say, never.  And I really laugh at some of these reviews.  All you Slipknot fans who can't stand music with melody and real purpose, I can understand how you can't handle something this good.<br /><br />As for you critics who can't stand the guitarist singing, you tend to miss that Serj does an awful lot of singing here too. When they harmonize- and I'm POSITIVE that you Slipknot fans DESPISE when something other than a guttural scream comes out of the lead singer's voice- it takes the music to a whole new dimension.<br /><br />And the lyrics?  Some are obvious, some are not, and I think that is what makes a good band great.  Each song is open to interpretation.  What sounds silly to one has a deep meaning to another.<br /><br />I equate Serj and Daron to  Freddie Mercury/Brian May.  Both of these duos take major chances, and do what they feel, not what the fans require them to do. Of course, SOAD have a strong political message, while Queen wanted to entertain, but they, Like Serj and Daron, are a force to be reckoned with when they are at full power.  And, Trust me, SOAD are firing on all four cylinders.  When the second part comes out, it will solidify them as the greatest new band of the 21st Century (And yes, I know they've been around since 1995)
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|The second brilliant season of \\"The OC\\" is true to form and typically blends halarious comedy with its at times controversal drama. Though perhaps not as consistant as its first flawless season, \\"Season Two\\" is nevertheless a compelling watch. <br /> <br />Picking up where we left out awesome foursome: Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) is back in his hometown of Chino; Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) has been blackmailed into living with her mother, for whome she has much hatred; Seth Cohen (Adam Brody), distraught and lost after his best friend's departure, has run away to Portland; leaving his girlfriend Summer ROberts (Rachel Bilson) behind in Newport. <br /> <br />Following the resolutions of these situations, come many more situations! These include: A long lost relative of the Cohens, a lesbian relationship, an ex-con coming to stay, a drug overdose, a near-rape, a divorce, a death and a shooting! Enough? 'Course not! I've merely skimmed the surface! <br /> <br />This season, perhaps a bit more than \\"Season One\\" takes note on some very prominant issues in teenagers' lives. Issues including, homosexuality, rape violence are explored. I love that \\"The OC\\" goes into these relavant issues, as the majority of viewers are teenagers whome must face them in real life. <br /> <br />Having said that, I also like how \\"The OC\\" always manages to have that comical edge to it. The screenplay, by Josh Schwartz, is full of more fantastic one-liners and wonderfully funny scenes, bringing out that \\"OC\\" style of never taking itself TOO seriously! <br /> <br />Finally, the music as per usual, is fantastic. This is particularly thanks to the addition of \\"The Bait Shop,\\" a regular hang-out spot for the gang where bands perform live. It adds that extra \\"OC-ish\\" element to the show. The music definately has more of a prominant role in bringing out emotion and other moods to their full. <br /> <br />And without giving too much away the finale of this 24-episode is, in my opinion, is the best \\"OC\\" episode ever made. THe ending left me utterly paralysed and craving for the third season! <br /> <br />I thouroughly enjoyed this second season. My only criticism would maybe be that it started out a little dull, by it regained itself and finaled to a truly stunning finish! Through its great script-writing to the contagious music, \\"The OC\\" will be around for a little while yet!
B0001LJC2K|3.0|This record is kinda like Rob Zombie's movie <br />House of 1000 Corpes. It's fun and it's spooky, but it's <br />just taking cues & ideas from all the great horror <br />movies of the past, like Texas Chainsaw and Evil Dead,  <br />It's nothing new or Original, just a laugh and fun.  <br />But you've seen it all before. <br /> <br />i don't listen to much radio or watch <br />much MTV, but I had heard their \\"Time is  <br />running out\\" single and immediately thought: <br />Radiohead! You can't deny it. The Pianos melodies, <br />the manic Guitar crescendos, the \\"singing\\"? <br />He sings like Thom Yorke. Period.  <br />IF I sang that way, i'd stop myself, because i'd  <br />feel Un-Original as an artist. <br /> <br />I bought it anyway after hearing the one song and gave it <br />a few spins. Yeah, it's rockin'. Yeah there are cool <br />strings. Catchy Pop Melodies. Crazy Crunchy Guitar effects <br />Yep, the drummer is good, But I can't fully embrace it. It <br />just feels \\"un-inspired\\" because I don't feel they are  <br />doing anything radically different, just pulling from all <br />the artists that have already done this type of music. <br />In fact, it sounds a bit dated like it should have come <br />out in 1997 or 1998. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0789723107|5.0|Memo to all \\"web designers/developers\\" - WEB DESIGN IS DEAD! <br /> <br />If you did not already know, all the interesting work left to do on Web sites (especially Intranets) is information design. I have been a web designer/tech muppet for over six years now and I have been trying to figure out which direction to head with my career. Do I want to try and program, do I want to learn Flash, do I want to learn SQL... how about none of the above please!  It has taken me awhile to figure it out, but usability and information architecture are the next logical steps in my career path (I mean really, how many of you designers want to remain in \\"production\\" for the rest of your careers?!). <br /> <br />Well, this book was a great jump start for the new direction I am headed, which is usability and information architecture.  Steve puts together a real nice and neat short book to help get you headed in the right direction (only took a couple hours to complete).  I really enjoyed the book, and no... it does not matter that he wrote it 5 years ago because many items on the web have not really changed that much since.  Do not believe any of the negative comments toward this book, only newbies/rookies would not see the value of this book. I highly recommend it and I am now starting up Information Architecture by Louis Rosenfeld.  If you are interested in watching a short presentation by the two of them when they reviewed the Library of Congress web site, check out [...] <br /> <br />Great Job Steve! <br />
B00007E8V4|4.0|There's this old adage in music where the demo/b-side stuff is sometimes better than the official album songs. In this case, they're not really b-sides since they never really appeared anywhere besides one or 2 things. This is more like the leftover album and it contains some of their better songs too. <br /> <br />Chic N' Stu: Quite funny song with lyrics about pizza and advertising? Very bouncy(best word I can describe it as) beat and a solid opener. 8/10 <br /> <br />Innervision: Officially the first single although Boom is the only one with a video. The verses have a great beat but it's the chorus that shines to me. A highlight. 9/10 <br /> <br />Bubbles: This song just sounds fun. 8 guitar parts in an under 2 minute song. Wow. It's extremely short but then again it works that way. 9/10 <br /> <br />Boom!: Only video released and the chorus I like but the verses are just pretty much Serj being the government bashing spokesman in a spoken word verse. The guitar parts though make it better. 8/10 <br /> <br />Nuguns: Very fun to play on guitar and has a odd mandolin or something solo. The verses didn't catch me but the chorus did. 8/10 <br /> <br />A.D.D(American Dream Disorder): To be honest I don't really like this song. The lyrics I like but the rest of it is just rather meh. 7/10 <br /> <br />Mr. Jack: A very Spiders-like bass intro before the drums come in with some ascending guitar chords giving it a more midtempo feel. Then you go into another heavy riff. It's not really a favorite but when I put it on, I like it. Quite odd. 8/10 <br /> <br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O: Fast guitar lick before yet another heavy riff. I like when they sing the title. Like a rock version of E-I-E-I-O. The verses have incredibly strange tongue twister lyrics. 8/10 <br /> <br />36: It's 46 seconds long yet it's oddly compelling. Has that bouncy and staccato feel from Chic N' Stu. Nothing much else to say. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Pictures: Ah, a good song. That verses have a great beat and how could you not like the chorus with the octaves and that chicken ba ba ba ba!. Over too soon for me. 9/10 <br /> <br />Highway Song: As usual a heavy riff with some harmonics to give it a different sound. Nice guitar sound during the verses but it's not really a favorite for me. Bridge is good though 7.5/10 <br /> <br />F*** the System: Good title. Rather noisy intro but the verses are very good, especially that falsetto \\"ah ah ah ah!\\". Chorus is not terribly interesting. The bridge sounds good, probably only bright spot. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Ego Brain: Very nice clean intro with kind Outer Limits/X-Files-esque keyboard in the background. The guitar during the chorus is oddly catchy and the verses sound nice although a bit too similar to later song Streamline. 8/10 <br /> <br />Thetawaves: Very interesting guitar work with harmonics mixed with big guitar parts. Serj's hyper/melodic vocals sound great as always. Sure nice to hear him sing so much after listening to Mezmerize. 8/10 <br /> <br />Roulette: Before the un-System like Old School Hollywood from recent Mezmerize there was this. Probably the only song that's very different from other songs from other albums. Guitar solo is quite a highlight. Sounds Zelda-esque to me. 9/10 <br /> <br />Streamline: Probably their best closer, to me it's even better than Aerials. Great verses, strong chorus, awesome chorus and I love that final scream by Serj. 10/10 <br /> <br />I always found their music interesting and great to listen to rather than being big sing-alongs like we do with other bands. Even if the song isn't appealing, there's something oddly compelling about the song and on this album, it's always interesting.
B00097DX3U|5.0|out of exile is a superb album and better than their debut which was great too.according to reports this is selling very well and will go platinum soon.buying this excellent cd will certainly enhance your credibility so rush to your record store and get it.

0060736267|5.0|I was seriously deprived as an adolescent. I never even heard of Betty Smith's classic novel \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,\\" let alone read it. And I was an avid reader who lived relatively close to Brooklyn. Whatever the reason for this significant omission in my early literary development, I remedied the situation recently, (yes, it took me a while). I can only echo here what millions of other readers have said since the book's publication in 1943, this is an extraordinary novel which enriches and delights. I can understand why The New York Public Library chose it as one of the \\"Books of the Century.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and drew from her own experiences to portray the hardships of the Nolans, a tenement family living in that borough's Williamsburg slums during the early part of the 20th century. Teenage Francie Nolan is an avid reader who wants to become a writer. She adores her father John, an alcoholic with a multitude of pipe dreams. He, in turn, loves his children and tries to be a good father, but he is not able to carry out his responsibilities. Nolan has become a dissipated man due to his alcohol addiction. Francie believes in him regardless, (and she's the only one), because they're soul-mates. Although it seems contradictory, the girl also possesses a strong practical streak. Her mother, Katie, abandoned all illusions for a better life long ago. She is rendered almost emotionless by a surfeit of her husband's grand schemes. However she stresses to her children that education is the only path out of the tenements. Grandma Rommely, Katie's mother, also reinforces the importance of education.<br /><br />There is a single ordinary tree visible from the Nolan's tenement window. It grows doggedly through the cement, in spite of harsh conditions which thwart it's development. Yet, it perseveres. For Francie and her father the tree symbolizes hope - the blossoming of life against all odds. It is like a beacon of of light in the darkness of their daily lives. Francie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams. Unlike her father, she has the inner strength and resourcefulness to make them come true.<br /><br />The author poignantly depicts the Nolan's struggles to survive and grow in a world of poverty, hunger, class prejudice and tremendous loss. Francie, a courageous girl, of strong character, comes of age here under extremely difficult circumstances. The portrait of her family members and her relationship with them is beautifully drawn, especially her relationship with her brother Neely. And turn-of-the-century Williamsburg is brought vividly to life. Broader topics are also introduced which enhance the narrative tremendously, such as, WWI, immigration, and politics of the period. Smith's characters are strong and well developed. She uses flashbacks to tell the fascinating story of John Nolan's courtship of Katie, their marriage and early years together.<br /><br />\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a heartfelt, moving novel which touched me deeply. Betty Smith's prose is powerful, as are her storyline and characters. This is a book I will keep to reread in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />JANArancie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams.

B0001KL5DA|4.0|In the first season, there would be a death, which would lead to a funeral, which led to the funeral home. The death and funeral would be tied into the ongoing story, a dimension they got away from in the second season. Otherwise the show is... near excellent. (And disappointing to have the fifth or sixth season playing in the US, and only the second in Canada.) The show is less about cliffhangers than everyday life. I suppose thats what they call &quot;Drama&quot;. A drama well worth watching. Now I get to buy season three.
B00080ZG10|4.0|One of Scorsese's biggest and best!  The Aviator is an amazing ride and a haunting journey into the mind of a deeply disturbed genius.  It left me feeling both inspired and humbled. <br /> <br />The cinematography and flight sequences alone are worth the price of admission, epically the scene when he crashes his new spy plane into Beverly Hills.  But special effects aside, the historical and educational value of the film is also worth the 170 minutes. <br /> <br />About the length... could have done without a few of the scenes showing how positively psycho Howard was... they dragged on and were just uncomfortable, which maybe is what Scorsese was going for, but I think they detracted from the story instead of added to it. <br /> <br />Never the less, The Aviator is a powerful experience and an epic worth watching.   <br /> <br />Enjoy!
006092988X|4.0|I really liked this book about a young girl growing up in early nineteenth century Brooklyn.  Francie is a memorable, real character and one who is intelligent and very aware of her situation and surroundings as she goes about life day to day - collecting junk to sell with her brother, observing the neighbors and each of their idiosyncrasies, reading one book a day, and most of all trying to win the love of her mother.  This book paints a very lifelike feel to this time period in Brooklyn including union sentiments, prohibition talk, war rumors and overwhelming class distinction.  It makes you feel like you were there looking through the eyes of Francie.
B0002KVUKW|5.0|I love this movie, i love the action in it. It's just great..thats all i can say, i'm speechless, you just watch it and see for yourself!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|Took a couple of listens, but it is really worth the buy. If can't withstand a change then you obviously shouldn't be listening to NIN. They have a new sound with every album. Don't stay stuck in \\"The Downward Spiral\\" era, move on to the new material.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Finally! Thats what i wanna say first off. I been into gorillaz since before Clint Eastwood dropped because Im heavily into Blur and follow Damon Albarn's material like a mad man. People mentioned the whole possibilty of a sophomore slump, which is rediculous! Damon Albarn is no stranger to making hits, he's a damn genius. All that aside, this album completely blows away my expectations. All songs will one by one day by day each become your favourite, because thats how Albarn's music is. But right off the bat, the first ones I took to were \\"Kids with Guns\\" (this track has a sample of salt n pepa's \\"push it\\" which will send chills up) then its \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"DARE\\", if you pay a little more for the version with the dvd then youll likely enjoy the track on there called THE SWAGGA. Any way you slice it, this is a great album that any one can fall in love with. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Rock it in your car, ipod, cd player, whatever. Dont let yourself miss it.
6304884419|5.0|This picture works out as a real modern fable. And this atmosphere is maintained all along the story through the eyes of a simple child who observes both universes: two opposite visions about the life. His father is a honest man who works hard to survive driving a bus and Chaz Palmitieri a charismatic mobster who bets and plays hard in his domains, a violent man who is captivated by this boy in a clear allusion to his frustrated paternity and the inability to establish himself as a normal husband. Somehow he assumes to Calogero as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.<br /><br />The time comes and others problems will appear when Calogero is in love with a  black teenager. The racial issue will be other tension element in this well built movie that seems improving through the years.<br /><br />De Niro made a honest and convincing tale about the options in the life: easy money or hard work.
B00097DX3U|3.0|I have been a very big fan of this band, and have seen every show including Lollapalooza, where they stole the show. Out of Exile is a very solid album, however Cornell allows Morello to directly rip off Soundgarden on Your time has come. Check out the song \\"Get on the Snake\\" by Soundgarden, it's EXACTLY the same riff!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Chariot Stripped is one of the most soulful albums of this time.If you like pop, if you like soul, if you like rock then check out Gavin DeGraw! And see him live, because his performances are the best.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|this album is now a coaster for my drinks- it is that bad- STREAN is the only good song
B000002TQB|5.0|it's a lifestyle. <br /> <br />To 1990s Anglophile Britpop Mods, this album is as essential as the Lambretta scooter was to their 1960s counterparts. Released in 1994, \\"Parklife\\" can be cited as a large contributing force behind the 1990s Britpop / Mod movements, scooter culture, Scooter Girl comic book, the re-emergence of Fred Perry clothing and The Track Jacket, countless DJ nights in Philadelphia, and Cool Britannia.  <br /> <br />A diverse album full of a wide-array of musicial styles (from the chaotic punk of \\"Bank Holiday\\" to the music hall waltz of \\"The Debt Collector\\"), it's consistent in that it is pure Kinks-ian Englishness. This cd is a must for everyone who's ever wished that they were, too.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Wow, after hearing Cigaro & BYOB I thought this was going to be a scorcher of an album.  Instead I find it kind of annoying.  Please do not get me wrong, there are good songs and riffs on the album, most noteworthy is Sad Statue, but the lyrics are SOAD's worst.  They are repetitive and simple-minded in approach.  SOAD has always had a repetitive element in a handful of their songs, but it does not work here.  Daron's voice is annoying at times (even though I overall like it), but I find more fault with the fact that he wrote 90% of the album.  This album is heavy, but more streamlined.  The real heavy parts have the same element.  Everytime I am about to groove to a song it instead creeps up my spine.   <br /> <br />Violent Pornography is an example of a cool repetitive part that goes into an annoying chorus & bridge.  The lyrics are dumb at the end.  Lost in Hollwood is hands down the worst song they have ever written.  I can truly say I HATE that song.  I mean what is the obssession with Hollywood?  What do they have to do with it?  So generic.  I met these guys right after the first album came out, and they still are the most awesome musicians I have ever met.  Well everyone but Daron, he would not come out of the bus to chill with us.  Maybe because he is too \\"Hollywood\\". <br /> <br />SOAD is one of the best bands of the last 20 years, it is a shame that they put out this average release.
B00097DX3U|1.0|what the?? sounds like the old bandmembers from one of the rocking\\"ist\\" groups ever, are on a severe dose of nytol! too bad, we all know how this story goes.. i did really like their first album though.
B00082IJ08|2.0|Their first album was not taken out of my CD player for 5 months back when it was released. I was a hard core gorillaz nut job. I still am a fan of the old stuff, very much so, and I was first in line to get this disc from the local record shop. If only I could go back in time and warn myself that I'm better off gouging my ears out with baseball bats than buying this album, I would.<br /><br />Murdoc and Russel are the only saving graces of the album (warrenting a solid 2 stars). After \\"Feel Good Inc,\\" the album turned into a posse rap...thing. Gorillaz only had two hip/hop songs on their first album and they were both by Del, fictionally a friend of Russel's. Seemingly, half of this album has rap in it, but it's not even good rap, it's (c)rap, and that's the worst kind. Imagine Vanilla Ice and Ice Cube having a baby (if you can't picture this, someone named Vanilla Cube who has an opinion but doesn't know what about).  Where the heck does De La Soul come into play? What business did they have being in the video as real people anyway? It's like the villain of Roger Roabbit came and is destroying my cartoon fantasy!<br /><br />The club-style music and flippant attitude toward content is a complete betrayal of the fans who knew and cherished the off-beat, quirky, unique, and experimental self-titled album.
B000002H97|5.0|I know everyone's going to have their own opinion, and I'm not going to be like other people and try and force my opinion onto you. However, I really love this album. It's what got me into Metallica in the first place. My friend had the album and played me some of the songs, and a couple of years later I heard them again and absolutely HAD to have it! I was so excited when I got the album, it's one of my favorites. Every song on it is full of so much artistic quality, I could listen to it all day over and over again!! Buy this album!
B00024BHTC|5.0|I will begin by comparing this to other Nightwish albums. It is heavier than their earlier work and features a full orchestra. It is quite different from other Nightwish's work, musically, with Tarja's voice toned down even more than on Century Child. It is also their most \\"mainstream\\" album yet, and the lyrics are alot less power metal-ish. Many say Nightwish have sold out, but I disagree, it is still the same old beautiful emotional music from the genius Tuomas Holopainen. <br /> <br />Dark Chest of Wonders: An excellent intro, with the old Nightwish theme of childhhod. Very heavy. Good orchestral elements. <br />4.5/5 <br /> <br />Wish I Had An Angel: Made into a single, the most \\"mainstream\\" track on the album, feautures an almost dance-like rythm. <br />Not the greatest song, with a theme of lust, but features nice vocals by Marco. <br />3/5 <br /> <br />Nemo: A good song, though still very \\"mainstream\\", disliked by many fans  for introducing \\"posers\\" etc. to the band. Also made into a single, with a good video. Nemo- meaning nobody in latin. <br />Good catchy chorus <br />3.5/5 <br /> <br />Planet Hell: An excellent heavy song with alot of vocals by Marco and an excellent orchestral beginning. About the state f the world. <br />4/5 <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood: A very different song about the sufferings of NAtive American Indians. Great song, with Indian flutes, chanting and a poem. Though the song is quite drawn out, and gets a bit boring sometimes, however great orchestral pieces. <br />3.5/5 <br /> <br />The Siren: Good song, more instrumental parts than lyrics, sounds sort of Arabic\ Egyptian. Features an electric violin! The title is self explanatory. <br />3.5/5 <br /> <br />Dead Gardens: Interesting in that the chorus is slower and more melodic than the rest of the song. Has a good heavy ending and a spoken passage, by Tarja I think though I'm not sure. <br />3.5/10 <br /> <br />Romanticide: Heavy and aggresive, with an ending like Slaying The Dreamer. Lots of tempo changes make it very interesting. <br />4/10 <br /> <br />Ghost Love Score: Considered by many to be the greatest Nightwish song ever. A 10 minute epic with alot of great orchestral pieces, great vocals, alot of tempo changes and a great choral chorus. Unbeleivable beautiful song. <br />5/5!  <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan: Beautiful Finnish ballad. Features a beautiful cello. In a word: Beautiful. <br />4.5/10 <br /> <br />Higher Than Hope: Another incredibly beautiful song. A perfect ending to the album. With a beatiful chorus. Based on the sad story of the death of a friend of Tuomas. Beautiful vocals. <br />5/5 <br /> <br />Some people say the album should have ended with Ghost Love Score, but I strongly disagree. The last two songs are so beautiful, and remember the theme of this album was film music. Higher Than Hope is a perfect slow sad song for the end of a tragic film. <br /> <br />This album is a must buy for all Nightwish fans, and I'd recommend it to fans of bands such as: <br />Evanescence <br />Lacuna Coil <br />Sirenia <br />Within Temptation <br />Sonata Arctica <br />Thats a diverse selection of bands, and as such this album appeals to fans of many genres of music. <br />According to Tuomas himself, it is : Symphonic Metal <br /> Well this was my first review, I hope you liked it, please rate if you found it helpful
B0006399FS|1.0|This pitiful prefabricated crap is a desperate and bold attempt to get a younger and more innocent audience by the means of sounding more mainstream. The thing that bothers me the most is that they agonized over this album. I was contstantly on their website over the last year watching all their news and interviews with the band, and I got the impression that this was gonna be something really special considering how much time and effort was being given. But the result ended up being what sounded like a reunion drinks in Bono's basement playing with some pawn shop equipment, out of ideas, dusted off some old pawn shop gear, pressed record, played for a couple hours, and called it a day. <br /> <br />Bono sounds tired...like he's an aging rockstar who can't quite hit the notes like he used to. A lot of the melodies are mundane and meandering while the lyrics are pointless. A lot of the music isn't distinct either. The Edge seems to be making up the guitar parts as he goes along on some songs and borrowing from bits-and-pieces of old U2 songs some of the others. There's a ton of piano/keyboards on this puppy...too much if you ask me. In fact, a lot of these songs sound more like B-side tracks. Very disappointing!. Where's the song-writing ability here ?  <br /> <br />While the U2 of old broke new barriers with their landmark albums, on HTDAAB they are content to offer a second-grade rehash of their 80's works. Innovation is non-existent here. Cliche, boring and unfocused. The quality of all the songs on this disc would not get any other band in the world recorded by a hobby label. The attempt to update their used 'classic' sound became more important than making good music, and it resulted in songs that sound amateur and dated. Tired music, tired singing. This is the laziest U2 album ever.  <br /> <br />Time to quit U2, really.
B00080Z53O|4.0|The Sea Inside is a very heavy duty film that allowed Javier Bardem to give a mesmerizing performance that consist of almost entirely on facial expressions. It's kind of slow-paced and depressing to see Ramon Sanpedro(Bardem) to wait in bed for thirty something years before fulfilling his wish to assisted suicide. Ramon is a renowned Spanish poet, and at the age of 26 he became a quadrilegic when he dove into the shallow end of a sea shore. Even though he couldn't see the sea from the room he lived, but he had always imagined himself getting out of bed and fly away from the window to the beautiful sea miles away. It took a lot of persuasion before his friend Rosa agreed to help him even when the government denied his request. To him, living like a vegetable is meaningless and has no dignity.<br /><br />This film also featured some powerful and touching performances from the supporting cast, especially Belen Rueda who played Julia(Ramon's lawyer), and Lola Duenas(Rosa). This is probably Javier Bardem's most challenging role since Before Night Fall. I was very moved by his performance, even though it's not a conventionally entertaining experience.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This could have been much better. It could have been on par with the original Star Wars. But Lucas @$#%ed it up. He cast the worst possible choice for Anakin and gave him impossibly bad lines (\\"Now this is podracing!\\", \\"Yippee!\\"). And then he made him destroy the bad guys by accident. BY ACCIDENT! The villains died because some 9 year old got trapped in the cockpit of a fighter and didn't know the thrust from the torpedoes. Another mistake goes without mentioning: Jar Jar Binks. Never mind the fact that Lucas sold out, he was just dumb. I thought the whole fight between the Gungans and the Trade Federation was dumb, too.  <br /> <br />This movie did have two saving graces, though: Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Both were excellent for the roles of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The lightsaber duel between them and Darth Maul was brilliant. Also the podracing scene was well done, and the scenes on Coruscant were beautiful (though I could have used without the scene in the Senate chambers).  <br /> <br />I noticed one reviewer complained that why the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo was never explained. They did it on the orders of Darth Sidious (or Emperor/Chancellor Palpatine), using the defense that they were protesting the Senate's taxation on trade routes. The whole event was just a brilliant scheme by Palpatine to get elected Supreme Chancellor so later on he could use the clone army (created in Episode II to battle the Seperatists, who he also secretly oversaw) to take over the Republic and become Emperor. He also orchestrated the events around Anakin so he would eventually become his right hand, Darth Vader.
0743454537|5.0|I think that this is a book everyone considering a \\"designer baby\\" should read. The author covers all aspects and emotions a family goes through when dealing with a very sick child and one who is there for \\"spare parts\\". It is interesting to see how everyone in the family deals with their own emotions, some rebel, want to let go, or can't let go.  A shocking ending brings us to realize we are not guaranteed any time here on earth, and to spend each day to its fullest.
0451457994|5.0|This book is much better than the movie, in my opinion. I am glad that I read the book before watching the movie; otherwise I think I would have been confused and bored. Not to insult the movie at all (even though the movie had crazy psychotic background music), but this book, 2001 a space odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke was 100% much more descriptive than the movie, captivating my interest from chapter one, The road to extinction, all the way to the last chapter, Star child. However, when I finished the book I was trying to interpret the ending, which, from reading many reviews I know I wasn't the only one somewhat perplexed. The ending is open to interpretation; you'll just have to read for yourself to determine what I mean. Nothing else I can add that hasn't already been said. The book is an easy read, and it really is truly a very good sci-fi book to read.

B00080ZG10|4.0|\\"The Aviator\\" is a 2 3/4-hour extravaganza that follows 20 years in the life of multi-millionaire industrialist Howard Hughes, whose innovation and willingness to spend his considerable fortune on his passions changed the film and aviation industries in the United States. \\"The Aviator\\" captured 4 Academy Awards in 2005 and was nominated for about 100 awards by critical, professional, and other organizations in the US and the UK. Director Martin Scorsese has translated the most productive years in Hughes' life into a visual and dramatic tour de force, beginning as Hughes takes Hollywood by storm in 1927 and ending shortly after his victory over Senator Ralph Owen Brewster in securing international flight rights for TWA in 1947. The film ends before Hughes' days at RKO Studios.<br /><br />As \\"The Aviator\\" opens, Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) is using his drill bit fortune to assemble the largest private air force in the world for his first film, \\"Hell's Angels\\", which became the most expensive film ever produced at the time. Hughes went on to make a couple of other notable films and to head RKO Studios, but \\"The Aviator\\" focuses on Hughes' aeronautical achievements more than his Hollywood career. Hughes' long relationship with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), in whom he met his match, is depicted sympathetically and a bit wistfully, as if Hughes' life would have turned out differently had Kate stuck around. \\"The Aviator\\" takes us through Howard Hughes' ambition to build a passenger plane that would fly above the weather, his acquisition of TWA, his 1935 speed record, his record-breaking circumnavigation of the globe, his war contracts during World War II, and the crash that nearly killed him in 1946. The film's dramatic climax is probably the 1947 Senate hearings in which Hughes' battled Senator Brewster (Alan Alda) for TWA's right to compete with Pan Am Airways in international flights. We see Hughes' famous obsessive-compulsive behavior gradually become a corrosive force in his life, but the film ends before he became completely debilitated by it.<br /><br />Thanks to Leonardo DiCaprio, Howard Hughes' enthusiasm -indeed obsession- with aviation and his limitless ambition come across in every frame of \\"The Aviator\\". The supporting cast is all-star. Cate Blanchett seems to play Katharine Hepburn as a combination of the real woman and of her public image, which may or may not be the best approach, but it's what viewers will expect. John C. Reilly is Hughes' talented, long-suffering business manager, Noah Dietrich. Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Gwen Stefani, and Ian Holm all have small roles. Kate Beckinsale is the glamourous actress Ava Gardner, Hughes' longtime friend. And Alec Baldwin is Pan Am's cunning president Juan Trippe. Dante Ferretti and Francesca Lo Schiavo's award-winning art direction and Robert Richardson's cinematography make \\"The Aviator\\" a visual delight. The incredible recreation of Los Angeles' Coconut Grove club, seen over the course of 3 decades, deserves special attention.<br /><br />The downside is that \\"The Aviator\\" is long and sometimes feels that way. The omission of most of Hughes' Hollywood relationships and his time at RKO may disappoint film buffs. And Scorsese's attempt to explain Hughes' obsessive-compulsive disorder by alluding to a childhood cholera epidemic is awkward. But Howard Hughes lived an extraordinary and eventful life, and \\"The Aviator\\" is a celebration of his achievements and a lament of his flaws. It's an entertaining epic of a larger-than-life American innovator.orce in his life, but the film ends before he became completely debilitated by it.

B0007XT87G|5.0|My 15 year son and I just drove 150 miles to see Porcupine Tree and it was worth every penny and mile. Excellent sound and music in a small venue. With songs from In Absentia, Deadwing, and Stupid Dream, it made for a perfect concert. I'd like to think of Porcupine Tree as a contemporary form of the early Genesis with Peter Gabriel (Trespass or Selling England), with a little mix of King Crimson (Bible Black or Red), while throwing in some very nice Steve Wilson (PT) influence that helps set it apart from the those groups. Production work is solid, the music is moving, and the lyrics mysterious. Only wish they would have played Open Car from DeadWing or Strip the Soul from In Absentia in the concert. But Shallow (DW) and Blackest Eyes (IA) made up for it. Check out their schedule on Ticketmaster and go see this group. You'll be screaming for more encores...........

B0008G2IRO|4.0|The new Demon Days is kickin, but the special edition leaves something to be desired.  They're maybe 20 minutes of footage and online bonuses don't make much more of it.

IN recent years with CD+DVD special realeases the two that come to mind are the EMINEM Show and Meteora.  Demon Days falls behind both.  THe best part about it was the band's commentary on the Feel Good Inc. video, but even that sounds forced.  The cd though is a must have for Gorillaz fan of any type.  If you feel you must have the DVD knock yourself out.  If your on the fence, keep those 2-3 bucks and buy a candy bar and coke to eat while you listen to your new tunes, you'll feel better.  I love the CD.  The DVD was an upset I was hopin for a little more effort.  Thats my two cents, so take it for what ever you fell its worese and remember to reject false icons.
B00004S6GL|5.0|When I first purchased Figure 8 at a local rec store I was blown away by the song Happiness. There is just something about the lyrics that make me uplifted yet still a little bit sad. Other great songs are Stupidity Tries, Everything Reminds Me of Her, and Somebody That I Used To Know. The last one was a surprise that caught me off guard when I heard it on vinyl at a friend's house. From there I had to buy 8 and everything else. <br />By the way-Paul didn't die in a horrible car accident. No Beatle has.
0385510454|5.0|The Broker was my first John Grisham novel, and I did enjoy the read. The story is about \\"The Broker\\", known as Joel Backman, who was a high powered legal consultant/Lawyer. Joel Backman let greed run his life, eventually leading to deaths of business associates and colleagues on a deal that went bad and sent nations into frenzy. Landing The Broker in prison for 6 years, resulting in an early pardon swayed heavily by the CIA's top dog Teddy Maynard's influence upon President Morgan, who just lost a landslide reelection and was on his way out of office. <br /> <br />The surprise pardon lands The Broker in Europe, while trying to take on a new identity and continuously look over his shoulder. When you read the book you'll learn a little bit of the Italian language, and you'll be captivated by each chapter. What The Broker is destined for, I won't spoil it for anyone, you'll have to read the book and learn for yourself. Overall, I enjoyed the story, and will read other Grisham Novels.
B00030590I|5.0|This is a fantastic telling of an epic tale of intrigue told from the perspectives of various characters. Each retelling features its own narrative style and visual/color keys. The viewer may slowly piece together the \\"true\\" amalgamation, but will you figure it out before the emperor? Style to burn, masterful battle sequences, great story, and a visually stunning array of set pieces make this a thoroughly enjoyable film. Don't expect a fight-a-minute-thrill-ride or an overly obvious plot line. Also, be aware of the strong undertones of Chinese political sensibility (PRC). As grand as anything Hollywood can crank out, but with sophistication, and staggering beauty and style. A visual meal for the eyes and mind that will satisfy long after it is consumed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although I watched this series first-run in all it's confusion, droppped cash for three, not one, boxed sets (.. must... indoctrinate...), and wait eagerly for the September 30th (now, are we SURE, Universal??, cuz I have to clear my calendar soon...), I wanted to toss my hat in the ratings ring anyhoo... To anyone purchasing, or thinking of purchasing this boxed-set sight-unseen, I caution you to watch the \\"Here's How it Was...\\" documentary, and hopefully it will help you to understand that in the midst the Reality Series craze, there were some trying to make a show they actually cared about on a network that was once known for being the banner carrier against network madness (remember Faux in the beginning? When we all cheered as it gained ground against the behemoths ABC, CBS and NBC? With it's unseemingly popular \\"Married With Children\\", \\"The Simpsons\\" and the first few years of \\"The X-Files\\"? Wither Thou, Rupert Murdock??). Throughout recent years, it seems the only way to get a \\"science fiction\\" tv show on air is to take scripts from the biggest soap operas, re-write them on a space ship, toss in an alien or two, make sure to highlight a tense sexual triangle, and call it \\"science fiction\\". 'Firefly' was something more - and the only consolation in the series being cancelled is that without the outcry, the surge in dvd sales and overwhelming internet word-of-mouth, there would be no movie. With the rough-cut previews in select cities during the month of May selling out in mere hours, it is a little vindication for a series full of characters we genuinely cared about, in a \\"den of theives\\". Up yours, Faux.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Through a subtle story and script, a floaty and dreamlike cinematographical style, and the underlying theme of humour and love, this film captures the feeling of being \\"lost\\" - literally  and figuratively. \\"Lost in Translation\\" captures the essence of what the main characters are experiencing during their stay in Tokyo. The movie encourages viewers to feel as lost as John Harris (Bill Murray), an impatient and washed-up American actor who's lost touch with himself and his family, or relate to the lonely young twenty-something wife, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is intelligent yet unsure about what to do with her life and finds herself in Tokyo because she followed her young and energetic (yet lacking a certain depth) photographer husband on a business trip. John and Charlotte meet at the highly polished hotel they are both staying at and form a unique bond during their week in the impossibly foreign, overwhelmingly urban, hectic and dream-like surroundings of Tokyo. Each scene captures the essence of being both lost in one's surroundings and in one's self. The scenes are designed to embody the sometimes embarassing and funny things that can happen in an unfamiliar culture, or simply capture the powerful bond that Charlotte and John share during their time in Tokyo. No, it's not a romance between Charlotte and John, but they do form a certain love and deep understanding during their week's stay and both begin to find their way a bit easier after meeting each other. Murray and Johansson were a pleasure to watch in this film and very convincing when capturing the essence of the bond that their two characters share. Not to mention a subtle and cool soundtrack, a floaty cinematographic style, understated humour, and best of all, a sweet yet appropriate ending, this movie is certainly one of the best films of the year.
B0000025P9|3.0|\\"Toto IV\\" was a huge smash hit, but it's REALLY stretching it to call it a classic. <br /> <br />\\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\" are two of the most ubiquitously-familiar songs of the '80s--they're certainly catchy, and David Paich's craftsmanship is impressive, plus it was wise to give at least portions of the lead vocals to Steve Lukather and Paich respectively. <br /> <br />Also, Steve Porcaro does get in one of his characteristically sincere-sounding reflective ballads with the enjoyable \\"It's A Feeling\\".   <br /> <br />By and large though, the music is a case of style-over-substance, with obnoxiously-flashy synthesizer flourishes, lame-brained lyrics, and the ultra-slick, professional-yet-rote vocals of Bobby Kimball.  The band does get a really good groove going on \\"Waiting For Your Love\\", but then Kimball's annoyingly insincere vocals come in and drag the song down.  \\"Make Believe\\" brings back the doo-wop flavor of the first album's big hit \\"Hold The Line\\", but not as effectively.  Lukather's \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" is a reasonably tasteful ballad, but it's simply dull. <br /> <br />\\"Toto IV\\" is proof positive that it takes more than just great chops to make a great album.

B0000CDLA7|1.0|A disapointment after such classics as Scenes From a Memory and Images And Words. DT have almost abandoned their prog metal on train of thought. 10min + songs with below standard riffs and emotionless solos.
B0000017CA|5.0|The term \\"underground classic\\" is one that gets thrown around quite a bit, but Acid Bath's When the Kite String Pops is one recording that can lay almost undisputed claim to the title.  Unfortunately, the underground is just as full of ripoffs and one-trick ponies as the mainstream (well, ok, maybe not quite that full), but Acid Bath were one band that managed to stand alone with a distinctive sound that was decidedly ahead of its time in 1994.  Between their stunningly tight and efficient musicianship and their flair for variety, one can only imagine what these guys would've accomplished if not for their early demise.  When the Kite String Pops is a highly potent slab of controlled substance-fuelled death rock at its most discordantly evil, with songs chock full of tempo and vocal changes, but its unpredictability only serves to enhance the harrowing mood that persists througout its running time.  At times brutally scathing, at other times hauntingly melodic, but always profoundly unsettling, this album is a psycho nightmare of epic proportions, with its fourteen pieces of nightmarish sonic impressionism pushing it to about an hour of nearly nonstop punishment.<br /><br />Although Acid Bath did show some superficial resemblances to such southern metal brethren as Soilent Green and Crowbar, their sound was still their own creation, one that liberally incorporated elements of sludge, thrash, grind, and rock.  Few bands have managed to convert angst and disaffection into great music-Neurosis and Godflesh are prominent exceptions-because such emotions tend to result in whiny, self-indulgent tripe, but Acid Bath succeeded where others have failed because their focus never deviated from creativity and songwriting.  It also doesn't hurt that the band had Dax Riggs, easily one of the most distinctive metal vocalists of recent years, out in front.  Befitting Acid Bath's abrasive sound and nihilistic lyrics, Dax alternated between an acidic, face-melting howl and a cleaner singing voice that managed to be every bit as disturbing as his more \\"metal\\" vocals.<br /><br />While the overall mood of this album is one of menacing rawness and insanity, that doesn't mean Acid Bath weren't methodical in their approach, as the precision and eclecticism to be found here are uniformly impressive.  Just check out the opener Blue, which effortlessly mixes slow, grinding torment with head-banging thrash-metal passages and plenty of Dax's doomy singing.  From there, the album rarely lets up, as there are a couple of downcast acoustic numbers in the form of Scream of the Butterfly and What Color is Death, but those are definitely exceptions to the rule.  Most of the songs on When the Kite String Pops are musical and emotional roller coasters, filled with intricate, oscillating riff patterns, frantic drumming, and malevolently pounding basslines.  If forced at gunpoint to pick a favorite tune I'd have to go with the utterly unsettling Jezebel, but every song here is fully realized and brilliantly executed, a rarity for an album with this many tracks.  If you're into extreme music, this album is a must-buy.  And even if you're not, and you just want to hear something with some true emotion and intelligence behind it, you should still give it a shot.  Demented as it may seem on the surface, in a music world dominated by brainless mainstream tripe, When the Kite String Pops managed to rise to the level of art.er singing voice that managed to be every bit as disturbing as his more \\"metal\\" vocals.   <br /> <br />While the overall mood of this album is one of menacing rawness and insanity, that doesn't mean Acid Bath weren't methodical in their approach, as the precision and eclecticism to be found here are uniformly impressive.

B0000CDLA7|1.0|who cares? and people ar going to read your reviews? you freakin idiot
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I agree with T burger.  I did do some research after watching this & the main point of the movie is the same.  He created this world after meeting & falling in love with those boys.  If they made every movie that's based on fact word for word they would probably be boring.  They're usually loosely based & meant more to entertain than to inform.  I loved it.  Story, great, sets, great.  Johnny Depp Double great.   <br />

6305144176|5.0|A great movie, loosely based on the Nam tour of the real Adrian Cronauer, as others have said. <br /> <br />Adrian is a respected member of the Vietnam Vet community and a number of Vet friends have mentioned his take on the movie - 'If I'd done half of that stuff, Id have ended up in Leavenworth'. <br /> <br />The movie is both a Robin Williams vehicle and a look at the first major build-up in the War itself. As for it being a 'police action', the irony was not lost on entertainers like Bob Hope, who often greeted his Nam audiences with \\"Hello Advisors!\\" even when there were more than 500,000 troops in Vietnam. <br /> <br />In many ways this excellent movie was the first real indication of the caliber of Robin Williams as an actor. He simply shines in this role and it led to a well-deserved Oscar nomination and on to greater things. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|A customer from Montreal who wrote a previous review does not know Marillion, I too was there since the Jester, this is like a rebirth, this IS Intelligent music, one that ages with youth. This album is in the league of PF wish you were here and genenis Nursery crime. The more you listen, the better it gets; true to it's appelation of Progressive Rock. It is true the first time one listens we get caught up in The Invisible man... then it all comes together... turns into a wonderful experience. Thank you Marillion!
B00097DX3U|5.0|Audioslave has been my favorite band almost before I heard anything from them.  The minute that a friend of mine told me that Cornell wsa teaming up with the Morello, Wilk, and Commerford, I knew that it was going to be amazing.  The first disc blew me away.  I'll admit I was a little nervous about this one after hearing 'Be Yourself'.  It's a good song just not a good first single.  I couldn't be more pleased with this album.  I do not skip over any tracks and I can't say that about too many discs.  'The Curse' is probably the best song Cornell has ever written. '#1 Zero' I think is probably the best song they've ever done and I can't wait to hear it live.  'YTHC', 'Drown Me Slowly', and 'Yesterday Comes Tomorrow' really stand out.  'Dandelion' grows on me with each listen.  It sounds like something you'd hear on Zeppelin's 'Houses of the Holy'.  If you're a RATM fan, you might not like it because it's not as riff-driven.  If you're a fan of great music, you'll love it.  Can't wait for more material and to see them in St. Louis.

Don't get me wrong...it's still entertaining. This is how things are when you mix terrorism with celebrities and Kim Jong Il with marionettes. That's it. All I can really say is that I'm at a total loss to describe this movie. I can relate most to Kim Jong Il's feelings............ <br /> <br /> <br />\\"MATT DAMON!!\\"
0385335482|5.0|This book is awsome!!  Its really funny and it isn't like any other book. Sophie Kinsella is a very good author!!  I love to read all her books and it seems as though her writing is never boring.  She has a way of relating to the audience and it just helps the readers enjoy the book more as it is.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is a classic that should be seen by every child from the 80's until forever!!!  It's one of the best films ever made and this 80's film is one of the most popular movies ever!  I have been watching E.T. since the 80's when it was released on VHS and never get bored of it.  It's hilarious when E.T. is stuck at home and then when Elliott gets home, he's wearing a dress!  That part cracks me up every time!<br /><br />I have just bought this 2 DVD widescreen edition at the mall which is the ONLY place I could find it and have just watched the 2002 remake and I did notice the differences but to be honest, the differences don't make the movie unbearable like all these reviews are saying.  I can understand about the guns but if you get this 2 DVD set, you'll have both versions that you can watch whenever you want.  You could watch them back to back even.  I couldn't believe it when I read someone's review saying that they actually left the theatre in 2002 when this movie was in theatres.  Come on people, this is really not a remake because a remake would have a totally different cast, but this just has some minor adjustments.  Even though I love the original the most, I still like this 2002 version because there is this funny bathroom scene between Elliott and E.T. that I actually liked.<br /><br />I really don't understand why people can't like both versions.  Yes of course the original will always be the best and the 2002 version is almost as good, especially with that added scene.  There are tons and tons of extras on this DVD set including interviews with the cast back from 2002 about the film too.<br /><br />Even today, at 27 years old, that ending scene (even though it's from the 2002 version nonetheless) still gets to me, it brings a tear to my eye.  That ending scene hasn't changed emotionally so it still affected me.  Now you know you've found a masterpiece of a movie when that happens!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen Sommers, and Alan Silvestri. I also enjoy watching Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman act.  <br />This is an amazing film, technically, and the acting and plot is exceptional too. I don't believe all the negative reviews! <br />I watched this twice, and enjoyed it a lot.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While waiting for the second season of Battlestar Galactica, I stumbled upon Firefly. Honestly, I confuse Firefly with The Tick when it aired or some other show that didn't seem engaging and so I missed the Television run of this outstanding series. I'm glad I found it on DVD now and regret that no more episodes will be forthcoming. Firefly is a great conglomeration of Sci-Fi and Old West... sort of like all the good Han Solo aspects of the SW:OT expanded upon. The superb dialog sprinkled with Mandarin keeps you coming back for more in a way that flashy high budget special effects can't on their own. Get this set. You won't regret it.
0142000663|2.0|While Steinbeck does, in the end, manage to convey an image of a portion of America during the Great Depression, it was an image confused by wordiness. The chapters describing the family where extremely slow moving, with dialogue and descriptions that would go on for pages, but which did not have any real point in the context of the story, and, perhaps more importantly given one of the main purposes of this novel, was not necessary to give the reader a \\"feel\\" of the times.  This overabundance of irrelevent information detracts from the story, in that it makes it difficult for the reader to fully submerse his-/herself in the story and, in the end, obscures the portrait of America at this time, as the reader is given so many details, that they begin to run over each other. Essentially it is a portrait that is completely lacking a frame, and this lack of a frame- or a context for all of the details, leads to a very confused image and story.<br /><br />I did not loathe the entire book, and even enjoyed some of the intermediate chapters describing the country as a whole (I particularly liked the one about the used car dealership), as I felt that these were well written, and the most concise.  Furthermore, the symbolism was rather good, but again, overdone, as was Steinbeck's use of naturalism.<br /><br />However, the main plot line, the Joads' migration, was overly convuluted and, after the umptenth tragic mishap, left me utterly apathetic to the fate of the family or their plight, especially since there seemed to be a tendency to \\"kill off\\" or otherwise subject the characters to tragic fates before they had been developed to the point that I actually cared what happened to them-- that they became more than just characters in a book (with the sole exception of Casey).  When I reached the end of the book, I found myself asking-- \\"what was the point?\\" Steinbeck dragged this family through the depths of hell, and yet it was done in such a clinical fashion that it lacked the human and emotional essence needed to make it be for a point, or even just that no one should have to suffer so pointlessly.  One acknowledges that (hopefully) already on a logical level, but this book failed to invest it with any kind of emotional level, despite the seven page conversations.  Having read \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" I know that Steinbeck can do better.  I was decidedly NOT apathetic to the fate of Lennie and George.  Even with allowances made for the different purposes of the stories, I cannot give a great deal of credit to a story seems pointless (except maybe post-modernism :-)cked the human and emotional essence needed to make it be for a point, or even just that no one should have to suffer so pointlessly.

B0007Y4TVU|2.0|SOAD stands head and shoulders above the rest of the nu-metal tripe out there, fusing disparate elements and making it flow, instead a contrived jagginess that is packaged oh-so-often with experimentalish music. No one can deny this, even if you find them unlistenable. Facts are facts.<br /><br />However, their ignorance of basic political theory (common to liberal talking heads and a few emotional, uneducated conservatives) absolutely kills it. I don't mind that they believe xyz, it's just that their so upfront about it. It increases their stupidity exponentially. It's the same old song and dance from celebrities who are completely out of touch with governments work.<br /><br />In BYOB, Serj offers this gem repeatedly:<br /><br />\\"Why don't presidents fight the war?\\"<br /><br />Wow. Ignorance!<br /><br />The other notably oblivious line is:<br /><br />\\"We live in a fascist nation!\\"<br /><br />No. USA IS NOT A FASCIST NATION, SIR. Here's the definition of \\"fascism\\":<br /><br />\\"A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.<br /><br />A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government.<br /><br />Oppressive, dictatorial control.\\"<br /><br />This does not describe the US at all. Fascist nations do no have a codified freedom of speech. Past fascist leaders include: Mussolini, Stalin, Pol Pot, Hitler, and our favorite: Hussein. this is Poli Sci 101 and so obvious, I'm ashamed to even point it out. Where were their songs when Clinton ordered the disaster calld Bosnia? Were we fascist then or not? They don't know what they're talking about.<br /><br />Use your heads, idiots!

We made plans to fly down and be in San Francisco all weekend.   <br /> <br />On the ticketmaster flyer that came with the Dead tickets it showed that Van was playing the Saturday night before.  Van Morrison.  We were stoked.  It was just up the hill from where we were staying.   <br /> <br />It was a challenge to get tickets- With the help of a scalper named 'rick' and a few more buck-a-roos my friend and I got seats together.   <br /> <br />We even got a picture with the scalper after the tickets were bartered.   <br /> <br />We were high as hell and in San Francisco and about to see Van Morrison.  Priceless <br /> <br />It was a decent show to see.  I had fun.  Not the best though.  There is a major drawback.    <br /> <br />The drawback about the show, and you hear him quite a bit on this album, was this 'Brian Kennedy' guy.  He was filling in all over the place for Van Morrison \\"!ALL-THE-FRIGGIN-TIME!\\"  When Van Morrison's (I'm throwing my hands up in the air) stagefright was too overwhelming or something this dude became stage front and center. Van Morrison stood back behind his performers, with his dark sunglasses on. I went through a lot of st*&f to see Van and here was this snappy-young-croneresque dude up there doing Van Morrison songs while Van is hiding out somwhere. <br /> <br />The songs on the album are not in order as they were in the show.  For the first few songs of the show my friend and I were trying to figure out were Van was.  He didn't pop out on stage until about the middle of the third song. <br /> <br />Not to mention that moondance was done way too fast.  Probably for a reason.  It was a good concert though.  I enjoyed being there. <br /> <br />The horn section that night hasgot to be the sexiest horn section that I have ever seen!  Yeow!!  There is nothing like a row of hot horn players in tight mini-skirts that really know how to blow their horns.  Another good point is that, well, it's Van Morrison and there just is no other Van Morrisons out there no matter how he lets the world see him.  It was an honour to see him. <br /> <br />If you get this album and you hear a Sam Kinnison scream \\"ow-owwwww!!\\" between songs...well...that's me. <br /> <br />After the show my friend and I went back down to the Tenderloin, got us some Jack, smoked both brown and grenn and sat on the sidewalk next each other trying to bum change for the eff of it. <br /> <br />Bumming change doesn't work well when you're having a good time. <br /> <br />      <br /> <br />
0060920084|5.0|It was the coffee stain that first caught my attention. I was walking out of the bookstore and there sat a book with a coffee ring on it. I paused and smiled. The book looked like it came from my desk, coffee stain and all. I smiled at the yellow roadside sign with the red arrow. I had observed many of these as I crisscrossed the United States over the last several years. With all these associations, how could I not pause and begin reading?<br /><br />A few minutes later I walked out of the bookstore with a smile and the book under my arm. Here was a kindred spirit, a sojourner lost in his own country, navigating his way through all that was familiar and strange.<br /><br />Mr. Bryson encircles the United States in a large figure eight with Des Moines, Iowa in the center, as it should be. He covers every region of the nation, aghast and agape at what he sees. He describes it in dry prose punctuated by laugh-out-loud comments. Mr. Bryson is pithy and riotously funny.<br /><br />If you are not planning on traversing the byways of the U.S. soon, by all means read this book now. If you have a trip planned, hold off reading this. Have your own experience, then pick up this book and see how many times your paths crossed. You'll laugh out loud too.
B000001DYD|4.0|This is the very first CD-format music I ever bought, at the tender age of 13, and my father promptly told me how annoying and inappropriate it was as soon as he heard it. Ironically, the first time I saw PJ Harvey was on a late-night episode of that old TV show \\"Beavis and Butthead\\"; they played the video for \\"Man-Size\\" where she just sits on a stool in her underwear and fidgets while singing the song. It was love! Naturally I became a huge PJ fan and proceeded to buy all her albums...until \\"Is This Desire?\\", when I kind of fell out of the artist's loop. I really enjoy the bare, stripped-down quality of this CD, as well as \\"4-Track Demos\\", which is even more reduced. It often seems that the more albums an artist puts out, the more produced the songs tend to seem, and PJ is no exception. Originality still prevails, but the sound is different these days.  <br />One of my favorites is the howling \\"Legs\\", which sends a creepy shiver up your spine the first (and almost every) time you hear it. It's stark and empty yet full of really overwhelming emotion - much like the jacket photography on this album.  <br />I recommend this one and her first album \\"Dry\\" - \\"Water\\" and \\"Plants and Rags\\" are great ones off that album. Another album which doesn't come up easily on a PJ search is \\"Dance Hall at Louse Point\\" which she put out with guitarist John Parish. \\"That Was My Veil\\" (track 4)is one of the most haunting and beautiful acoustic songs I've heard in years.
B000002GJH|5.0|This would be the definitive work. This is, perhaps, the best CD I've ever heard. Perhaps it's because this album was a labor of love. Perhaps it's because Chris Cornell is one of the best songwriters and singers in the history of rock. Perhaps it's so wonderful because it is truly an amalgamation of everything that defined the Seattle music scene in that era. It's probably a mixture of all these things. <br />In case the other reviewers haven't enlightened you, this album was the eulogy to Andrew Wood, lead singer of Mother Love Bone, and penned by Chris Cornell and former MLB member Stone Gossard. The idea began with \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" and \\"Reach Down\\", both directly about Wood, and written by Cornell. When Cornell showed the demos to the other members of Mother Love Bone, the project just evolved. <br />Usually, my mood dictates what music I listen to. This album, however, defines my mood. When I put it in the player, I can't stop listening to it. I've had this CD for...6, 7 years? And it never gets old. Ever. Let's break it down track by track (keep in mind that my rating system, out of 10, is relative to other songs ON THIS ALBUM, not compared to the world at large, they are all 10/10 when compared to everything else): <br /> <br />1. Say Hello 2 Heaven; undoubtedly, this is the best song on the album. It is filled with so much emotion, and it shines throughout. The love in this song can be felt both in the lyrics and the way Cornell sings it, he was at the absolute top of his game here. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Reach Down; I did not realize that this song was 11 and a half minutes long until I'd listened to it about 10 times. This song is heavily driven by the music, not as much by Cornell's lyrics. The solos and subsequent jam session that lasts about 7 minutes are sublime, you lose yourself in the music. This song is an incredible work of art, the lyrics and music are beautiful, but it still isn't my favorite. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Hunger Strike; the most commonly heard \\"radio song\\" from this collection, it also features Eddie Vedder on backing vocals. Some people are annoyed by the extended repetition of \\"I'm goin' hungry\\", but personally I love the way Vedder's voice melds with Cornell's. They dance around each other, melodically. This is also the most \\"mainstream\\" song on the CD, not as bluesy or experimental as say, \\"Reach Down\\" or \\"Four-Walled World\\". 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Pushing Forward Back; the most driven song on the album, this song has the most edge as well. It's apparent that Cornell sings this one from his heart, and although it's brief, discusses how he fought with his mother. This song marks a shift in the CD, from the very emotional first three songs about Wood to more introspective songs Cornell wrote about himself, but wouldn't fit on a a Soundgarden album. 8/10 <br /> <br />5. Call Me a Dog; what is this song about? Your guess is as good as mine. This is, personally, my least favorite track on the album, and one of two I'll skip at times (the other is \\"Your Savior\\", but for different reasons). \\"Call Me a Dog\\" most likely relates to Wood...but then who can tell? It's oddly placed after such a driving song like \\"Pushin' Forward Back\\". 6/10 <br /> <br />6. Times of Trouble; one of the best songs on the CD, this song mixes mellow blues with mind-blowing and heart-wrenching vocal fury from Cornell. The subject material is heroin, and the addiction. The tempo of the song mirrors the content, as it starts slow (as if you were taking the drug), and it ends in violent splendor, as if Cornell were talking to heroin addicts everywhere, telling them to hold on. The last line is especially moving, musically, the way Cornell screams \\"...if somebody loved you and left you for dead...\\" always gives me goosebumps. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Wooden Jesus; another fantastic song, probably my second favorite behind \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\", mainly for the way Cornell sings it. It's a commentary on religion in America, specificallyCatholicism (Cornell was raised Catholic, something he struggled with), but it discusses how much faith they place in figurines to save them from their troubles. He mocks people who try to bargain with God, and the tone of the song is both sardonic and regretful. Cornell lets his vocals explode toward the end of the song, and it is miraculous- you can heart the bitterness dripping from his voice. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Your Savior; another religious song, continuing well the theme of \\"Wooden Jesus\\". Cornell sings of his digust for the evangelical types who \\"whisper his tragic end\\". He accepts their criticism and their complaints, but he does not want what they offer- their savior (Jesus, for the inept). I sometimes skip this song because I don't feel it fits musically with \\"Wooden Jesus\\", so I sometimes move to \\"Four-Walled World\\". Still, its an excellent song, the angriest on the CD (despite not being as hard as \\"Pushin' Forward Back\\"). 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Four-Walled World; I have mixed feelings on this song. Sometimes I love it, and sometimes I love it less (I'd be lying if I ever said I disliked it). It has a strange cadence and tempo, and like the previous two songs is very much spoken from Cornell's heart. Ostensibly, it speaks of a lover who has left him, but it is more about Cornell's struggle inside his own world, or his \\"cell\\" as he calls it. It is still an excellent song, the most bluesy on the CD, rivaling \\"Call Me a Dog\\", but much better presented. The end, once again, features about two solid minutes of Cornell destroying his vocal cords in a delicious manner, and you can feel his frustration with himself. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. All Night Thing; an excellent end to an excellent album. \\"She motioned to me/that she wanted to leave...\\" The organ-thing in the background is a bit strange sounding, but it follows the heavy snare line, both led by Cornell's dominating voice, very much the centerpiece of this song. The song is slow and smooth, and bring a sense of closure and contemplation to the work. You can feel Cornell pacing the streets of Seattle thinking about this song, forming it in his mind, as he sees people shack up in bars across the city. 8/10 <br /> <br />When all is said and done, this is the best album ever written, if for no other reason than the emotion so readily visible (or audible, I suppose). I am addicted to Cornell's voice, and this is him at the very tip top of his vocal career. No one on the Seattle scene or anywhere else could match the raw emotion that man brings to a song. I say that this CD is the perfect encapsulation of the Seattle music scene in the early 90s because it is truly a \\"supergroup\\". The men in this band had played with every major act in the city at one point or another, between the five (occasionally six) of them. The awe-inspiring power of this music made me go out and buy a Mother Love Bone CD, just to see where these wunderkinds came from. As a sidenote, its more like Queen mixed with Nirvana than it is Soundgarden or Pearl Jam. But hey, RIP Andrew Wood, and I'm sure he's thankful that his death spawned such fantastic music. <br /> <br />Everyone should go out and buy this CD immediately, for the betterment of mankind.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Note, before you read on, just know that I myself do not like the Rap genre. It doesn't appeal to me and I just never really liked it. <br /> <br />Even with that though, I completely LOVE this Album. One of its quirks being that there was an over usage of rap in \\"Demon Days\\" as opposed to their first CD, but even with that, this Album executes everything greatly.  <br /> <br />Unlike the first CD, alot of the songs go right into the other. It gives the CD a great flow and it's very enjoyable when listening to it on your car or CD player.  <br /> <br />The only thing that really stopped me from giving this CD 5 stars is the poorly executed rap, mainly in the song \\"Dirty Harry\\". I don't have any problem with the rap in the songs (Feel Good Inc., November has Come, All Alone) but in Dirty Harry, it was just so unnecessary.  The song length is 3:43, for the first two minutes, you hear this great beat, a great song. Then the rapping starts and it just sounds so out of place. It kind of ruined the flow since if it's skipped, Feel Good Inc. starts up, and \\"Dirty Harry\\" plays into \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" <br /> <br />That and the loss of Miho Hatori (Vocally, at least), at times you kind of lost the feeling of listening to the Gorillaz and it felt more like a CD with Damon Albarn and special guests. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great CD, a real accomplishment for the Gorillaz, but just little things that prevent it from being a truly great Album.
B00004VWAF|5.0|Music is all numbers.  Listen to this with your brain, not your heart.  Listen for correlation in division of time (which is universal), not tonal frequencies (as those are cultural).  With an open mind, comes understanding.  Keep your predjudices to yourself, its your own damn fault if your mind is too slow to keep up.  Ultimately, perfection is mathmatically definable.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Three homeless people find a baby in the trash.  Now they have to decide what to do with her - keep her, give her over to the cops or try to find her mother.  As the three try to decide what they need to do the three people end up exploring love, life and the meaning of it all.  It is very touching, with lots of humor and heart in each moment.  The artwork is lovely, the director Satoshi Kon's work is clearly seen within each frame and the movie is something you can't miss.<br /><br />At 92 minutes this small film has a huge punch and the DVD has a great behind-the-scene featurette to boot.  Along with Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress this should be in the library of any anime fan's library.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Howard Hughes created aviation history, pushed the film industry to new heights and generally excelled at whatever interested him. He flew high on wings of wax. Ultimately, he got a little too close to the sun and as the wings fell apart his anxieties consumed in resulting in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder taking control of his life.  Obsessive compulsive disorder can make an individual feel as if their world is both completely out of control and completely ordered. Someone with OCD requires constant reassurance which is why they are constantly checking the door to see if it is locked, obsessively stacking things, obsessively counting and fight irrational thoughts that threaten their structured existence. It's a symptom of a much larger anxiety. Howard Hughes was a risk taker something that you frequently see in people with OCD but the consequence is a worsening of their OCD symptoms and anxieties. As Hughes fame increased, his need to push the envelope increased and his OCD increasing took control of his life. \\"The Aviator\\" is much more than a movie about a man with anxiety and mental illness. Scorsese fashions a film about a man with an endless stream of ideas fighting the demons of mental illness at every turn and, ultimately, losing the battle. Of course we don't see the end of the battle we just experience Hughes in his prime; when we first meet him he's shooting \\"Hell's Angels\\" a Hollywood epic that cost the unheard of amount of $4 million in the early 30's. The film revolutionized action films and nearly ruined Hughes. \\"The Aviator\\" focuses on the difficulties that Hughes has with his OCD and how it both hampers and pushes his life forward. By the conclusion we see a hint of the Hughes that locked himself in his hotel room in Las Vegas and wore tissue boxes on his feet.<br /><br />Hughes had affairs with actresses (Katherine Hepburn in her Oscar winning role), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), Terry Wright all the while battling corporate giants that want him to fail; Pam Am's Juan Tripp (Alec Baldwin in a wonderful, oily performance), a corrupt senator (Alan Alda), studio moguls and film censor Breen (Edward Hermann). Stocked with wonderful cameos (Jude Law plays Errol Flynn, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"'s Brent Spiner as plane designer Robert Gross, Ian Holm, Willem DaFoe, singers Rufus, Loudon, and Martha Wainwright, \\"Six Feet Under\\" star Frances Conroy) Scorsese's epic tries to make sense of Hughes within the context of how he defined himself (much like \\"Raging Bull\\" did). A stylishly directed film, Scorsese pulls out all the stops to make \\"The Aviator\\" visually ravishing whether it be his imitation of the Technicolor look for each decade covered or the dazzling juxtaposition ironic images, Scorsese is at the top of his game here. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker provides Scorsese with ample support with her brilliant editing. Although overlooked by Oscar by the more timely \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", I have no doubt that time will be much kinder to Scorsese's more ambitious biopic epic. Despite criticism to the contrary, John Logan's fine script may not dig as deeply as some critics like but it's the subtext Scorsese, Logan and DiCaprio provide that may this film much richer than it appears on the surface. While there's outstanding performances from the entire cast, DiCaprio's performance anchors and dominates the film as it should. He brings Hughes to life in the film and his rewarding collaboration with Scorsese continues to be fruitful more so here than in the deeply flawed \\"Gangs of New York\\".<br /><br />A beautiful, sharp, vivid transfer receives as much bit space as possible with only the alternate commentary track by director Martin Scorsese with occasional contributions from producer/director Michael Mann and editor Thelma Schooner taking up additional space on the first disc. I'd suggest that film fans keep in mind that the smeared look that you see early on textured surfaces is intentional as the digital master has been grain reduced from start to finish. This was, again, designed to resemble many of the textures seen in early 2 strip Technicolor films. Likewise, you'll notice that the peas on Hughes' plate appear almost turquoise representing the reproduction capabilities of early Technicolor. You'll notice that the color becomes fuller, richer as the film progresses presenting the advancement from early 3 strip to later, mature 3 strip Technicolor. The sound is quite good using the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround format in a number of subtle but important ways throughout. Dialog and music are crystal clear.<br /><br />This flawed masterpiece is equaled by a great set of extras on disc two. \\"Making the Aviator\\" is a standard making of featurette where everybody praises everyone else. There's also a deleted scene where Howard tells Ava about a car accident (although the cut scenes involving Amelia Earhart are not included. Perhaps we'll get this in a deluxe expanded director's edition). The History Channel documentary Howard Hughes focuses much more on the technical innovations he introduced including the changes he made in the world of aviation, satellite technology. Hughes biographer Pat Broeske provides interesting insights as to what occurred in his life that made him the way he was. James Steele author of \\"Howard Hughes: His life and his Madness\\" points out how the Hughes empire was build on the oil drilling bit his father designed. Little of the time in the documentary focuses on Hughes movie making. George Marrett author of \\"Howard Hughes: Aviator\\" discusses how Hughes and his collaborators broke new ground with air speed records and unique airplane designs.<br /><br />\\"The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History\\" is an original documentary on the achievements that Hughes and his company did to push the envelope of aviation. It's not a conventional biography obviously. We learn from Hughes author George Marrett about Hughes' love of flying. Including interviews with DiCaprio and others associated with the film, it incorporates footage from \\"The Aviator\\" but also manages to tell Hughes role in changing air travel and breaking speed records.<br /><br />\\"OCD\\" focuses on the obsession compulsive disorder that drove him and relieved his anxieties and unstated fears. Actor Leonard DiCaprio discusses the research that he did for the role including contacting OCD expert Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz at the UCLA medical school. OCD is a disorder in the brain where bothersome thoughts intrude into the individuals thoughts without prompting creating fear. The compulsion is the behavior one does again and again to try and control the feeling. There's an interview with someone who has OCD who helped DiCaprio focus the compulsive behavior, the way it's said correctly to help pull it all together. The intrusive thoughts are caused by a chemical balance in the brain. There's also a panel discussion on OCD featuring Scorsese, DiCaprio and Hughes widow Terry Wright.<br /><br />\\"An Evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda\\" although a promo piece actually provides considerable insight into the characters they played, Hughes and the film itself. DiCaprio discusses how his early interest in the subject brought both Michael Mann and Scorsese on board.<br /><br />Scorsese's animated commentary continues to be a highlight of any DVD he's a part of. When Scorsese slows down a bit Schoonmaker steps in to discuss the editing, the craft of filmmaking and some of the more challenging scenes in the movie. Mann occasionally jumps in. Since he was the director originally attached to this project (he dropped it because he had already made two films based on real people \\"Ali\\" and \\"The Insider\\" back-to-back and wanted a break) and became a producer his comments are also quite interesting as well particularly about Scorsese uses two color Technicolor, three strip Technicolor and other devices to plant the film firmly in the various decades they took place in.<br /><br /> Although it might not be a masterpiece in the same mold as \\"Raging Bull\\", \\"The Aviator\\" is one of the best films that Scorsese has made in the latter part of his career. Heck, I'd argue that it does belong with his best films; it's just a different sort of film from what most of Scorsese's fans are used to. It has much more in common with \\"New York, New York\\" than with \\"Taxi Driver\\" although there are also elements of the latter film represented in Hughes obsessive personality. I hate comparing movies but far and away \\"The Aviator\\" is a much deeper, richer, ambitious and intelligent film than Clint Eastwood's topical but overrated \\"Million Dollar Baby\\".

B0002VKZL6|5.0|Many of these reviews hit on the same point.  At first listen, this effort didnt knock you down.  Not a BROTHERS IN ARMS. No instant gem.  Perhaps not, but when you take a little time to relax with these songs, resist the impulse to be instantly judgemental, and really listen to these words, you will find a very full piece of work. <br /> <br />Knopfler is always going to be a guitar statesman.  However, people forget or dont always give him due for his storytelling.  And the collection of riff-raff that inhabit the worlds he has built here are as varied and obscure as you can get. <br /> <br />You can easily pick out the petite bios on Ray Kroc, Elvis, Sonny Liston.  And even though you know them, you find that he's telling you something new.   <br /> <br />But how about a song sung by the banjo player in a traveling medicine show?  Where do you come up with that? <br /> <br />STAND UP GUY wont be the first song here to tempt you, but when it does, you will know just who he is and how he feels.  A nobody who will never be anybody, but as warm and alive and convincing as any Lord or Lady. <br /> <br />The stories are exceptional.  The delivery is crisp and for the most part frugal.  Not a lot of overdone on this CD.  There are some songs that you will like more than others, some you will like less, but the total at the end will make you smile.  And more important, sing along.  These are your people too. <br /> <br />Give this one the time it needs, and you will find you cant stop playing it.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I'm a 46 year old mother of 3 who somewhat embarassedly loves SOAD.  Toxicity is one of my favorite Cds. When I heard BYOB on the radio..they were on the \\"everybody goin to the party\\"..part and I freaked when my son told me it was SOAD. Now I think it's one of the best songs ever made. However, being a mom, I'm sensitive to vulgar language and was disappointed with the lyrics of the other songs. Although I think most of the songs are good musically, I can only give it a 4, or even a 3 1/2 if I could figure out how to do that, because of the language.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Never heard of the band, and I don't recall what I had purchased or investigated that made Amazon say I might like this, but it was absolutely correct. <br /> <br />Pick an instrument you want to hear in rock, and it is here. The tempos and build-up are reminiscent of Smashing Pumpkins for me, but that isn't to say they sound like SP. There are whisps of Siouxsie & The Banshees in there (e.g. Tinderbox rather than Peepshow), but this is a very mature and modern sound. Honestly, it is hard to think of musical styles that seem to have affected the sound of this (that haven't already been mentioned in the review), but I feel any music review would be amiss if it didn't at least attempt to describe the sound. Unfortunately, this attempt is very feeble. <br /> <br />The first song washes over you with a positively gorgeous build-up of tension/expectation (which it then, blissfully, satisfies), and the rest of the songs will carry you over from there. I received this CD with Darling Violetta, Mary Timony, Shonen Knife, and the new Sleater-Kinney... the last of which I haven't had a chance to listen to yet because \\"Funeral\\" has not left my CD player since it went in. <br /> <br />Fantastic and totally unexpected release. <br /> <br />I would also like to mention that it includes lyrics. For me, a band that doesn't take the effort to include lyrics is very frustrating: I want the whole package. \\"Funeral\\" delivers that package, with linear notes, a pic, lyrics, and a fairly stylish cover (if that matters to you). <br /> <br />I cannot wait to pop this release on unsuspecting listeners. <br />
B0006VIE4C|4.0|Is this the vintage 1977 edition like everyone loves??  Or is this the new 1997 edition that supposedly sucks (to die hard fans i hear)???
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I think this album is horrible. In an effort to sound \\"more grown up,\\" she has filled her album with songs about sexual topics that I don't care to go into. Instead, she just comes across sleezy and lacking in talent. I used to be a fan of hers but not anymore, not since she changed her whole style and came out with this aweful album. I don't even like most of the songs on it. Some of them are pretty strange, too. I really like \\"Everytime,\\" though, which sounds more like the Britney I used to know and love, and is very pretty. But I can't handle the other stuff, and I was especially appalled by the song \\"Touch of My Hand.\\" (And then she even pretended to act it out on stage while she sang it on her tour!) Wow. And to think I saw this album being sold at Toys R' Us one day... this isn't a CD I think the little kiddies should hear. Don't waste your money on this one.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|either you love it or you hate it. this is how kids right after kindergarten talked way back when which is what makes the movie so funny. So if you did not use words like flippin, infiniti, or ever hit on girls with the worst compliments ever you won't get this movie.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Well, I'm sitting in the theater waiting for this to start and thinking about how great that last movie I saw was. It was The Pacifier btw and it rocked unlike this carp. Well, this thing starts and immediately something is wrong. I yell to the guy and tell him to turn up the color or something but he says that's how the movie is. WTFzzors? I just saw The Pacifier which was awesome in color and now I have to watch this carp trying to be a relic from the 1950s? If I wanted to watch a boring movie with bad dialogue in black and white, I'd rent Citizen Kane or Seven Samurai. I come to the movies to be entertained not to watch boring talk with no color. Pass this carp up. Go see The Pacifier with Vin Diesel instead. He's a much better actor than anyone in this movie.
B000002UB6|4.0|Let it Be has been unfairly maligned. After years of studio experimentation and trickery, the Beatles attempted to get back to basics with this album, and they succeed tremendously. Unfortunately, this music was recorded during the nadir of group relations, and the album is suffused with hints of the impending split. Nevetheless there are great songs and performances. <br />   I have two gripes though. Am I the only Beatles fan who thinks Across the Universe sucks? I just don't understand the appeal of the song. I know Lennon thought highly of it, but the melody is weak, the lyrics are juvenile and the vocal is tentative at best. I can't even listen to it; the Past Masters version is a little better. Secondly, The Long and Winding Road is dreadful in any incarnation. Maybe the Spector treatment ruined the song for me, but it's just too maudlin. Conversely, Dig a Pony is a woefully underrated gem: great guitar riff and lead by George, spirited, vocal by John and beautiful harmony by Paul, and Ringo holding it together with power and finesse. And before anyone complains about the the lyrics being nonsense, go listen to I Am the Walrus! <br />   The title track, is of course, an all-time Beatles classic. Has Paul ever sounded so smooth and soulful? I get the feeling that he was learning about gospel music from Billy Preston, who played keyboards on the sessions. George's solo is just killer, more trenchant and emotional than the one featured on the single version. This is a towering achievement in the Beatles' canon. <br />   Two of Us, I Got a Feeling, I Me Mine, and For You Blue are also very good. One After 909 is an early rocker that dated back to their Cavern Club days and was performed with gusto on  the rooftop gig, as was the great version of Get Back which appears here. Maggie Mae is probably in keeping with the Get Back concept, with its references to Liverpool. So while not a great track, it's not a complete throwaway either - plus it's only 38 seconds. Dig it is quite enjoyable also. Again it's very short, a snippet of a very long jam. The Beatles are having fun, and John was having fun free-associating. If you think about it, Dig It, Maggie Mae and the spoken asides that pepper the album are pioneering examples of the annoying practice of using skits, intros, outros and interludes in so much modern music. I think Billy Preston was the first \\"featuring....\\" on the single Get Back.  <br />   Let It Be is a better album than Sgt. Pepper. Maybe not the best recording/production, but it has better songs and better conceptual unity. It better illustrated the magic that occurred when all four Beatles were in the same room together....or on the same roof!
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie is a bit long and there is not much action but there are scenes worth watching, namely the \\"race\\". <br />The decors are quite superb and the plot although limited is an interesting build up to the rest of the saga. <br />The little boy tends to annoy with his irritating voice but his cute looks save the day. <br />The appearance of R2-D2 and 3PO for the first time also make up some of the Star Wars highlights. <br />Beware, it is a long movie and the end tends to drag on. <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|you read every one of these reviews huh? and you wait for me to come on- you freakin loser
B00008H2LB|5.0|I found this CD quite enjoyable. I have to give it five stars due to the creativeness of this band. I normaly become angry when rap is mixed with nu-metal (hard rock, ect.). However, they did an extraordinary job. (Until Jay-Z ruined Numb.)  <br /> <br />I also have purchased Hybrid Theory, although, Meteora is almost musicaly better. I reccamend this to those who are first trying nu-metal. Although the intro and instramental remix tracks are kind of a waste, this CD rules over all.  <br /> <br />They just need to answer my one question, was the weed really necessary?
0312199066|5.0|I knew almost nothing about Gene Cernan before I read this book. It's a shame it took me so long to discover him, because Cernan is a compelling and entertaining storyteller, as well as a very typical example of what he himself calls the \\"macho fighter pilot\\" ethos that Tom Wolfe chronicled in The Right Stuff. Compared to several other books that I've read about the U.S. space program in the 1960s-70s (Aldrin, Shepherd/Slayton, Kranz), Cernan gives us an a more objective and unflinching picture of the jockeying for flight assignments and the clashes between strong, ambitious personalities that roiled NASA's Astronaut Office. He also speaks frankly about the disastrous effects that the demands of being an astronaut had on several \\"picture-perfect\\" astronaut families, including his own. All of these were unmentionable topics at the time, and are still not talked about frequently today. However, the book is not only about the negative aspects of the space program. Cernan spends quite a bit of time describing the wonders that he experienced orbiting the earth and walking on the moon. Highly recommended.
0930289234|5.0|I picked this up to read on a plane just to kill time. I was expecting the run of the mill graphic novel. What I got was a story so in depth, engrossing, and touching that I could not put it down. This was definitely a welcomed change from the technical books I normally read. The story of the Watchmen actually forced me to feel for the characters in the story, and understand their motives. You grow to respect the characters as more than 2 dimensional storyboards. In this world of masked vigilantes driven to dish out justice as a novelty hobby, they are faced with the concept of a real life superhero changing their very existence, making them obsolete. The younger generation just cannot let go of the concept of dressing up and fighting crime and continue despite the appearance of the \\"God Among Men\\". Some do it because they are forced to, some get sexual gratification out of it, some are driven by deep psychological issues brought on by troubled childhoods, and a very small handful do it to make things right. The story has more twists and turns, and really pulls the reader into their universe, and forces them to wonder \\"Who watches the Watchers\\" when they go beyond the line. Even if you are not into the whole comic genre, this is a story that will move you.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This man is one in a lifetime as far as I'm concerned. Ever since I was a  teenager, and that was a long time ago, the sultry and sophisticated 'blues' sound of Frank, Dean, Tony, et al have kept me interested in 'real' music, and that's why I have played contemporary and Jazz piano for over 40 years.. the romance that is so delectable in a young persons' life -even if they don't know it at the time- is found  - and will last- in Michael's music..thank God there is someone out there with the talent that Michael exhibits. His renditions are first rate by any standard, he brings new life and zip to old classics that the current generation(s) may not have even heard before. And his song &quot;Home' almost brings me to tears every time I hear it.. isn't that something. Canada should get behind Michael as we have here a budding superstar of the magnitude of Celine Dion and even the untouchable Gordon  Lightfoot.
B000067J1H|5.0|I believe that movies are made to entertain. I basically enjoy all kinds of movies...action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, thrillers etc. and I rarely criticize a movie because I know the effort put in to make a movie. But every once in a while, a movie comes out that does more than entertain, it makes you think, it makes you question and it changes your perception about various things. Well, Fight Club is one of those movies. I have watched this movie many many many times and it never fails to astound me. This is in my opinion, one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.     It is basically about this guy, only known as the Narrator who is a white collar employee, working a 9 to 5 job, has his own apartment and his own collection of branded items. Sounds familiar? It's not surprising many of us can relate to this guy. Anyhow, even with all these material items, he finds his life unsatisfying, he feels that something is lacking. Because of this problem, he suffers from insomnia. He finds solace in attending those self-help sessions but soon meets another faker, Marla. The presence of another faker makes him uncomfortable and the sessions don't work for him anymore. It is then that he meets Tyler Durden, this cool, smart talking dude in a plane. This guy intrigued him and when the Narrator returns to find his apartment burnt, he turns to Tyler for help. From there on, this movie spirals to dizzying heights, with the creation of Fight Club by the Narrator and Tyler, and later what seems to be a takeover of Fight Club by Tyler leaving the Narrator clueless about what's going on.     I really have to say this movie really fascinated me so much with it's intelligent ideas and dialogue, partly because deep in my heart, on some level...I can relate to the character, and although I don't agree with everything that is said, it does make me think and how many movies can do that? Fight Club to me, represents our lives in a twisted way. It challenges us to think about things inlife, for example our view of success. Does working a boring job to pay for things we don't need a success? Do you experience fulfillment or do you think you're wasting your life away? (...)  Everybody involved in this movie did a fantastic job but extra credit has to go to the director, writer and the actors. David Fincher has come a long way from directing music videos for Madonna. I am a huge fan and I've seen all his work, Aliens 3, Se7en, The Game and more recently Panic Room. No one but him can create an environment of decay and desperation in this movie that just grabs you. Kudos to the actors involved too. Everyone was perfectly cast. The talented Edward Norton was excellent in his role as the Narrator. He so accurately resembled the average guy that it was scary. His voice has a perfect tone for narrating the story and he reminds me of a young Kevin Spacey. If only he gets better roles, he may very well go down a legend in Hollywood. Brad Pitt has always acted in likeable hero roles as well as \\"feel good\\" movies and he has managed to pull it off but in many of those roles, there was nothing special or extraordinary. In this movie, he was fantastic. I consider this to be his finest work together with his role as Det. Mills in Se7en. No one but him could've pulled of Tyler Durden. When he spoke, it just didn't sound written, it sounds authentic, the words come alive...like he really lives his life that way and it's what he truly believes. Any other person might have made it less exciting but Pitt nails it. And last but not least Helena Bonham Carter as Marla was also a really good choice. She did not have much screen time, but the times she does appear..she delivers with a fine performance.     There was a lot of bad publicity about this movie and although I admit this movie may not be for everyone, I loved it and so did most of my friends. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. This movie is not a renter, it's a keeper. It's movies like this that sets the bar higher for American cinema...seriously. And finally, as Tyler said \\"It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything\\".
B000002WPI|5.0|A classic album by any standards.  Wu-Tang delivered big time with their debut album.  No track should be skipped on this album.  Especially da mystery of chessboxin.  With half the Wu-Tang clan on here and Ol Dirty layin down a classic verse you can't go wrong.  Also METHOD MAN and CREAM were big hits but overall this whole album is a bit hit.  It is a must have for any hip-hop fan who wants to have real hip-hop in thier collection.
B000957O82|2.0|This is one of the most overhyped movies out there. I admit, this movie started of strong, but after the 1st hour or so...it just spiralled downhill. <br /> <br />It is about Alex Hitchens, this date doctor who basically helps big-hearted losers to get noticed by their dream girls. In his words, he creates the opportunity for them. One of these guys happens to be Albert who has a thing for Allegra, the rich and beautiful multi-millionaire. Meanwhile, Alex meets Sara who's a gossip columnist and sparks fly. What happens next? I'm sure anyone with a brain would know. <br /> <br />I have nothing against romantic comedies. The thing with this kind of movies is the story. We all know how it's gonna end, so the writers should thrill us with the ride there. A good romantic comedy should evoke some kind of emotions. Unfortunately, even with the talented cast they have here, it's all gone to waste with a lousy and utterly predictable script. The starting 10-15 minutes was great, and I was actually looking forward to the movie. Then Will Smith gave me laughs when trying to woo Sara, played by sexy Eva Mendes. But other than this, there's nothing else that entertained me. And most of the funny scenes are actually in the movie trailer. <br /> <br />Kevin James, who I really like in King Of Queens is underused here. And his chemistry with Allegra (played by Amber Valleta) seems kinda dead. He doesn't really seem that infatuated with her. Will Smith tries to salvage this movie for all he can, but there's just so much a guy can do. The second half of the movie really was pretty boring because of it's predictability and it seemed like I was watching a mixture of other romantic comedies (How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days and Notting Hill comes to mind). <br /> <br />This movie might be good to watch with your partner, but even then...just rent it, it's not worth buying. This movie fails because of the script, the actors bring all they can to their roles but it just isn't enough. If you want good romantic comedies, get Hugh Grant's movies...they're predictable of course but you'll have a hell of a good time watching the story unfold.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now..
B000929AJQ|5.0|Trent's thunderously technological turbulence reaches a new zenith with the new album.  I was a skeptic; initially, I thought Reznor wouldn't be able to outdo the Downward Spiral.  In the end, I was right . . . because Reznor smartly doesn't try to. <br /> <br />Instead, the new album feels more organic.  Reznor has hired out more guns to play (instead of playing an insane Beethoven and recording all his own tracks) and that has seemed to help.  The first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", has true punch but lacks the resonance of, say, the Greatful Dead releasing \\"Casey Jones.\\"  Further, Trent is good but Jerr Bear is better.  Set the new NIN release aside and don't worry - your local alt station will play it over and over to drill it all into your cranium anyhow.   <br /> <br />I do appreciate Trent offering up tracks to Apple users to remix and bushwhack at will.  That struck me as open and cool; in fact, reverse my previous non-recommendation.  Run out and by two copies of the new album for you and your mother,  Check Amazon now; my used one is for sale right now.  <br /> <br />And Trent just wants to play on em-tee-vee in front of a simplistic Bush backdrop and they won't let him?  What's a rage-ridden rocker to do?  Can rock and roll ban even the hint of rebellion?  Yes, Trent has aged, and, yes, many of the beats feel (or are overtly) retro, but isn't everything? Everything is built on what came before it.  Deal with it, buy the album, and enjoy it.  Then, as the lights draw low, go groove to the Dead. <br /> <br />Trent makes forty seem fabulous !!
B00009V7P8|4.0|Like I'm sure countless thousands of others, I scrambled to find out who sang the beautiful, haunting song that opens Mike Nichols' adaptation of 'Closer.'  I know a bunch of people must have followed the same path, because when I went to Virgin to pick up a copy, there was a large sign that said \\"If you want the music from the film CLOSER\\" (last word in about 128 point font on the signage) \\"then you want Damien Rice's 'O'.\\"<br /><br />My problem is that that song (\\"Blower's Daughter\\") is so good that the rest of the CD (to my ear, at least) pales in comparison.  I've yet to find anything else that resonates with me.  Regardless, 'O' deserves at least four stars simply based on the perfection Rice achieves on that one track.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie was a great surprise to me. I watched almost by force (since I though: Oh no, not another sexually-charged high school movie), and at the end I was surely glad I saw it. It's very odd, yet it is realistic in the sense that that's the way things work in small rural towns. And what's also true and realistic is the portrayal of what I call the \\"num generation.\\" Kids without expressions or passion for anything, their only attitude towards life is ambivalence. I personally know several kids like the ones portrayed in the movie, and it does hit a home run. To top it off, the movie is also comedic at times and satirical at others. Very fun to watch. Highly recommend.
B00002E224|5.0|First, a note about the amazon.com review which tells us that 'Before Sunrise' is about a \\"14-hour tryst in Vienna.\\"  The dictionary defines a tryst as \\"an arrangement for two people, usually lovers, to meet.\\"  Viewers of this movie will agree: the meeting of Julie Delpy's 'Celine' and Ethan Hawke's 'Jesse' is anything but arranged, and these these are could-be, wanna-be, not-quite-there-yet lovers.<br /><br />That aside, 'Sunrise' is highly skilled filmmaking, crammed full of  witty, intelligent dialogue which - in an impressive feat - comes out of the mouths of Delpy and Hawke sounding natural and unforced.  The standout scene (in my mind) is probably one in which Delpy says she \\"needs to phone her friend in Paris\\" and proceeds to engage an initially perplexed Hawke in a simulated conversation that reveals exactly how she feels about what's going on between the two of them.  Then, when the the roles are reversed, Delpy shows an ear for comedy with her characterization of Hawke's back-home buddy Frank, answering his call with a dead-on \\"Yo, dude, what's up?\\"  Who wouldn't fall in love with Julie Delpy circa 1995 (or now for that matter)?
B000002HMH|4.0|load is definetly metallica's melow side but thats not all bad i mean this album proves how great their lyrics can be and even though the guitar work is not up to par with master of puppets and my personal favorite And justice for all!! i still think its a really good album i have owned it for many years and i can still listen to it all the way though and believe i am a die hard metallica fan. i still think this cd is a good listen. <br />if would like to hear a more mellow tone on metallica then this is the cd for you. <br /> <br />my metallica cd ratings <br />kill em' all- 4 out of 5 great debut album <br />ride the lightning 4 out of 5 fight fire with fire and for whom the bell tolls are awesome  <br />master of puppets- 5 out of 5 great guitar and bass work love it <br />and justice for all- 5 out of 5 jason proves what he can do <br />black- 5 out of 5 so many great songs so little time <br />load-4 out of 5 my review says it all <br />reload-1 out of 5 only 4 good songs <br />garage inc-5 out of 5 all great covers <br />s and m- 5 out of 5 beautiful concert i own both the cd and video version and i plan to get the dvd <br />saint angry- 3 out of 5 still a good effort <br />
B00006GFAB|2.0|Good God, Kiss has more \\"best of\\" albums than studio ones!  What Kiss fan on earth would have any need to buy this CD?  They released a massive box set just a few years ago, for crying out loud.  I'm a Kiss fan, it'd be great to own every Kiss album for the sake of having the complete catalouge, but I mean come on already.  They're not just beating the dead horse now, they're holding it by the hind legs and thrashing the carcass back and forth into a pulp.  If you want to milk the last of the diehards a little more at least throw them something they don't already have, if there's even a scrap remaining, that is.
B00004XPP0|2.0|I'm not a big science fiction fan.  In fact, the first time I viewed Star Wars in the theater as a fifth-grader, I simply didn't \\"get it.\\"  I'll always remember walking out thinking \\"What's the Force?  Darth Vader..is he a robot or human in costume?  A Wookie...is he from the Planet of the Apes, or Dogs, or what?  Rebel forces...are they the good guys or bad guys?  Sand People?  Alderan?  etc., etc. etc.  What the heck is this stuff all about?  Why do people like it so much?\\" <br /> <br />I loved the spaceship special effects, but that was about it.  Luckily, my dad hadn't seen the movie, and after all the huge publicity, he wanted to see it, but not alone.  So I agreed to go with him (what the heck, why not?)  For some reason, upon the second viewing, my eyes were opened.  I suddenly understood it all, and loved it!!  There's so much introduced in the first movie that it was more than my brain could process and understand the first time around.  It's definitely one of those movies (at least for me) that needs a second viewing to truly appreciate and understand.  It's not your typical Star Trek type of science fiction (which I've never liked). <br /> <br />Empire Strikes Back came out, and I was blown away.  Not only had I grown a little older, but the characters had as well.  Darker, deeper themes throughout the movie.  More exciting as well.  It's ultimately my favorite of the bunch.  Revenge of the Jedi?  Well, we all know it was pretty lame, but at least it finished the story. <br /> <br />Anyway, I recorded the original Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back from TV about 12 years ago.  I'm so glad it did.  I actually love the graininess of the film and the lower quality special and sound effects.  If anything, I think it adds to authenticity of the story.  It's almost like a new film that has purposely been film in black-and-white with fake scratches to make it look older.  It's fitting, especially since it takes place \\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\\"It takes you to that place as you would expect to view it today--appearing like some ancient relic recently dug up from an archeological find.  This is especially true for those of us who viewed it as children. <br /> <br />Now, look at the \\"new, improved\\" Special Editions.  They may as well be New Coke.  The computerized special effects look more fake to me than the original ones.  Everything looks so clean, so perfect...too perfect to be real.  At times, I feel like I'm viewing some cheesy \\"Star Trek - Deep space nine\\" TV show.  The mystic is gone, ruined forever. <br /> <br />If Lucas really wants to make more money (which we ALL know it's what he does best), he'll re-release the original films on DVD.  He recently said you could still buy the originals on VHS, but I can't find them anywhere.  The demand for originals is huge.  Why won't he do it is beyond understanding. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002H97|3.0|Sure it's a classic rock album no doubt about it.  But it's nowhere near the band's best work and its success was just as much a matter of \\"right place, right time\\" as it was quality.  There are a few solid Metallica tracks on TBA, but some filler material as well, which knocks this release down a notch IMO.  It was their last listenable album, everything since then has been total garbage.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|you take this way too seriously-- i almosy feel bad for you-- almost- THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!
B000001FQQ|2.0|This has always been an odd album to me.  It's not quite as awful as \\"Crazy Nights\\" or \\"Animalize\\", but it's nothing to write home about, either.  HITS always came across as sounding like an album full of outtakes.  A few tracks are actually pretty decent, for example, \\"Betrayed\\", \\"Street Giveth\\", but all in all it's sub-mediocre at best.  To the band's credit, there are 16 tracks on this CD, though.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is a remarkable album by Ryan Adams with beautiful and also passionate back-up by the Cardinals and vocal assist by Rachel Yamagata. These are 18 distinct tracks bound together by the emotional, melancholy lyrics and melodies of Ryan Adams.If you're even close to a fan of Ryan Adams...this is a must have. Treat yourself, NOW!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION, NOT THIS! <br /> <br />I hate that it has a lot of CGI inserts that don't looks like real. They change the Ewoks end song that i don't like it, i prefer the original song. In some scenes looks like Jabba has anorexia or something and the worst is that Hayden Christensen from Attack of the Clones appears on it!!!!!!!
B0007YMUZW|3.0|<br />The first disc isn't very good but the second disc has its moments, some of it sounds like the songs I don't like on Pneumonia or worse while some of it is quite good. I would say on Cold Roses Ryan is in the same town of Jacksonville Skyline and Heartbreaker but still can't seem to find his way home.  <br /> <br />I remember the rose but honey down at Midway Park the cold roses will soon be forgotten.  <br />
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|This movie is hilarious!  As long as you watch it with the realization it is not a serious film, you will enjoy the viewing.  Half the fun is picking out the actors in the over-the-top characters.  This is a typical John Waters movie, if that tells you anything.  Big spoof of the 50's and the movies that harken back to that era.<br /><br />Plot:  A square of a girl falls for the leader of the drapes.  Hijinks ensue and eventually girl gets guy and becomes a \\"scrape.\\"<br /><br />Definitely get the DVD version because the equivalent of the VHS can be caught on late-night tv and offers no special features.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This edition doesn't include DTS sound but all the extras are new and different from the 2 disc-set. <br /> <br />Also include an audicomentary with Russell Crowe(his first audiocomentary on DVD) <br /> <br />The disc's case will be digipack. Thanks Universal! <br /> <br />Good update for all Gladiator fans but don't expect an extended edition like Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|If you've been a U2 fan over the years, the first thing that you will realize about Atomic Bomb is that it is significantly different from the band's previous albums, but that's not a bad thing.  <br /> <br />Atomic Bomb opens with the band's popular single, Vertigo. A perfect way to open the album, Vertigo gets you pumped for the rest of the spectacular tunes that Atomic Bomb has to offer. Miracle Drug is my absolute favorite song on this album, and no U2 fan should go without hearing it. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own will leave you in tears. Love and Peace was absolutely stunning and I had the tune stuck in my head for days. City Of Blinding Lights is a personal favorite of mine which I really enjoyed, and All Because of You is truly ass-kickin'.  <br /> <br />The rest of the songs on Atomic Bomb are basically your average U2 tunes that you would come to expect from the band. Overall, if you consider yourself a U2 fan, then do yourself a favor and pick up Atomic Bomb right now, because if you don't, you'll never be able to live with the fact that you didn't.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|After I hearing this cd for the first time, I went out and bought tickets for the next Coldplay concert in Buffalo.  Quite frankly, there isn't one Coldplay that is below average.  Some people say this music is too mellow, but the way I describe is with an oxymoron: \\"intense-mellow\\" music....you will agree with me if you really enjoy this music as much as I do.  If you're new to coldplay, go out and buy Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood To The Head before getting this cd.
B00082IJ08|5.0|First I have to say I was spinning holes in my floor waiting for the new album from Gorillaz.  Ever since he left Blur, everything Damon Albarn has touched has turned into gold from my point of view! <br /> <br />When I got the disc I was very excited and awfully afraid that the follow-up was going to be mediocre.  But no Sir!  From \\"last Living souls\\" with it's oldschool and childish discorhythms via Roots Manuvas punching word-spitting performance on \\"all alone\\" to the finalizing three-track tale with Dennis Hopper's trustgiving voice and Heavenly London Community Gospel Choir shouting me right into the center of Gorillaz' weird and wonderful world of playful artistic anarchy!   <br /> <br />The melodies on this disc are pure popmusic-art.  And the wrapping is ever-changing with all kinds of styles thrown together and with twists and brakes and surprising bridges around every corner.   <br /> <br />My most pleasent surprise was the amount of oldskool sounds.  Some of the tracks give me associations to the swedish underground synthpopband The Knife.   <br /> <br />Buy it!
6305003882|4.0|My familiarity with \\"The Basketball Diaries\\" is from reports at the time of the Columbine tragedy that this film was an influence on the perpetrators of that massacre.  Having such a dubious association I was reluctant to view this film.  Having now seen it I can see my reticence was unfounded.  This is a gripping account of a talented teen, Jim Carroll(Leonardo DiCaprio), and his descent into the hell that is serious heroin addiction.  The film depicts how even the best of us can be insidiously seduced by our innate desire for kicks to try such a horribly addictive drug.  DiCaprio, who has since matured into one of our finer actors with his role in \\"The Aviator\\", shows early signs of the promise since fulfilled.  Mark Wahlberg is also good as Carroll's best friend who also falls into the heroin trap.  Good turns are provided by Lorraine Bracco as Jim's concerned mother and Ernie Hudson as Reggie, Jim's best friend even if he doesn't know it.  The film's biggest flaw is that ostensibly it's set in the sixties but it doesn't seem to have a feel for that era.

B00030590I|5.0|With \\"Hero\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" director Zhang Yimou has jettisoned to the forefront of filmmakers working today.  There is no denying that Yimou has a distinctively strong visual style.  That said, if it's all style and no substance, so what?  \\"Hero\\" is blessed with a good narrative.  Essentially, the theme of the film is what defines a hero.  The answers that Yimou offers are both surprising and enlightening.  Strong cast that includes Jet Li and Ziyi Zhang.  Essential viewing.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Unfortunately, a very disappointing album which gives a clear indication of Dream Theaters decline artistically. Not being content with having given us the studio-improvised pretentiousness of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Dream Theater, five professional musicians in their 30s and 40s, want to become angsty, heavy and dark. Unfortunately, they stopped being young and angry 20 years ago, and the result is laughably bad, devoid of any impact whatsoever. Solos are abundant, with clean precise picking and fast runs, but this listener feels nothing when he hears Dream Theaters studio indulgences and empty virtuosity. There is also little magic to be found in the harmonic minor heavy metal riffs John Petrucci churns out on his seven-string guitar, all following the same basic patterns of root note-transition-root note, often throwing in a bar or two in odd time signatures (so it can classify as \\"prog\\", like that should matter). <br /> <br />All that was magical about Dream Theater has vanished, a development starting with the appointment of Jordan Rudess as keyboardist. With this man behind the 'boards, all sense of restraint vanished and those that had given us such brilliant albums like Falling Into Infinity and Images and Words now went fully professional and started composing in the studio, instead of honing their compositions to the max in rehearsals. Train of Thought is clear evidence that DT are now releasing albums for the sake of releasing them, and is so mediocre that it marks the first album by said group that I have not, and will not, purchase.
B000001FA4|3.0|I cannot count how many times I have argued over the best U2 album ever made, only to be challenged by someone claiming \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" as their best work.  I imagine that this is based on the fact that \\"Pride\\" is on this album as there are no other arguments that would be valid.  For me, this album is boring and lacks any character in depth of sound.  The absence of Steve Lillywhite is evident(as has been the case with the Dave Matthews Band).  While Eno and Lanois would go on to produce far more superior albums for U2 in later years, this project sounds like a rough draft more than a finished product.  I would have to place this album at the bottom of the U2 collection, I hardly ever pull this CD out to listen to it.  As the reviewer above states, you can listen to the best tracks from this CD live on \\"Rattle and Hum\\" in much better forms.
B000784WMW|4.0|I was pleased that they finally put this definitive version of Jane Eyre on DVD. All the episodes are there, with several scenes that I had never seen before, either during PBS broadcasts or on the older videotape release. The picture quality is excellent. The only negative is that each episode is broken up by running the end and beginning credits. On the older videotapes it ran like one long movie - definitely preferable. However, all in all, it is not too distracting, since the music is pleasant and it kind of reminded me of watching this originally twenty years ago on PBS. The only two places I really minded the breaks were in the bedroom fire scene and at the wedding.  <br /> <br />I continue to like the chemistry between the two leads in this version and the fact that the producers didn't wreck havoc with the original storyline or dialogue. This version continues to be the best out of all the releases of Jane Eyre ever made.
B00070DK5K|5.0|Criticisms of the sound and playing on this album are totally misplaced. It beats me how anyone could ever think that \\"music\\" could result from overlaying countless overdubs, played in the absence of the other musicians and on equipment barely louder than a sparrow chirp. This kind of living, breathing recording is standard in the jazz and classical worlds. What really makes the difference, however, is Michael Kamen's arrangements, which lift the music onto another plane -- compare the far less interesting -- and sonically much tamer -- versions on the original albums and the Ziggy live album. This applies particularly to the songs from the Ziggy studio album and Aladdin Sane, the originals of which are rather juvenile: in Michael Kamen's hands the atom is split and we are witness to a glorious explosion of musical potential, showing Bowie's true greatness (as does his magnificent singing). The incomparable band, too, really allows this music to take flight. I first bought this album when I was 12 years old, and I can see that it had a lasting influence, exposing me at an early age to music's unlimited possibilities: a typical day's listening today (I work at home) is likely to include Mahalia Jackson, Miles Davis, Bach, Weill, Haydn, Funkadelic, Ray Charles, Tom Waits, Ali Farka Toure and Bang on a Can. I feel I owe this freeing of perspectives partly to David Bowie and Michael Kamen. This album was the gateway.
B000000993|5.0|One of the best albums for this genre of the 20th century! With a strong theme for water throughout this album it is and always will be one of my own personal favorites. After the release of \\"opiate\\" (1st album) Tool was looking for their first full length album. With as much hard riffing, philosophy induced, fine tuned musical genious that we come to expect from TOOL it is still a hit now. \\"Sober\\" is one song that you can mention to even the most miniscule tool fan and expect one helluva reaction!  Prison sex, Flood, Swamp Song... these songs make it impossible for you to even think about anything else when it comes to music.  With the recent induction of Justin Chancellor to take over Paul D'Amour on bass guitar, Tool just gets better and better! Tell you what; If you can listen to \\"Sober\\" \\"Bottom\\" \\"Swamp Song\\" \\"Undertow\\" and not like Tool... congratulations, you need to be committed!
