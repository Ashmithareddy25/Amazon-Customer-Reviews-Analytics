B000HKYOK0|5.0|Come on!  It's Star Trek!  Whatever the quality of the cast & production, or how quaint the special effects, this is what started it all.  This show presented a future that most people could barely imagine.  In some areas technology has surpassed what is shown here.  Although I am still waiting for 'beam me up Scotty!'  This show needs to be honored for what has come after as much as for what it was to begin with.  It is iconic & is an intrinsic part of our culture.  Personally I can't get enough of any of the Star Trek permutations.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I liked the way that the story was told.  The explanation (of the ending) was not what I expected.  I would recommend this movie.
B000IDEORY|4.0|It was a coming of age that was paced well. I enjoyed Jennifer Gray and her role as the young inexperienced girl.
B00578FKVE|4.0|Much better without commercials, which are a distraction.  This is a great way to watch a television series (or perhaps the only way).
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have never been so pissed off by feeling the frustrated feelings of a character as when I read this books.  The authors did an amazing job of conveying their feelings and weaving an amazing tale at the same time!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Somethings I rate movies if I doze off or not durning it.  This move I doze off towards the end.  It was not what I expected, it was better.  It is a delightful movie between and Mom and son.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is fun for anybody who live  in an little house or apartment, for that one person ok n to feel control of an entire city/town.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's not as challenging as some mahjong games I have but it is fun!  No clock count down to pressure you.  I really like it and I'll probably buy the others once I finish this one.
B0030B624E|5.0|Zombies and comedy, what's not to like.  This movie is incredible.  The casting was perfect.  Woody Harrelson turns out a great, hilarious performance  Emma Stone is wonderful.  There is graphic violence - umm it's a zombie movie!  There is language, umm Woody is in it! But otherwise it's PG13 - I was fine with my 14 year old daughter watching it and she loves it as well.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Good packaging that included the cooler heatsink and fan along with the CPU.  Installed on the Gigabyte GA-Z77-DS3H MB without an issue.
B003JRLFPK|5.0|Love bon jovi. Love the whole album. I'm so glad there are so many choices and I was so excited.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a fun game. Love it when he smacks into stuff and that you can play with facebook friends.fun fun
B0006HJEMC|2.0|I got this for my advanced model loving boyfriend hoping he would love it. It's super small and too easy to put together. Took him about 15 minutes.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I discovered this book thanks to well written article in Wired magazine.<br />I am half nerd, in fact while I spent countless ours of my youth playing d&d or rolemaster, I did not spent them playing video games, my hand coordination is horrible I fear.<br />The story is pure joy and fun, choked full of references to old arcade games and role playing jargon.<br />But the beauty of it is that even if you do not know of these &#34;old&#34; entertainments, you are going to enjoy the story like a fantasy and science fiction romance adventure with tons of action.<br />Don't miss the fun!
B0012QVJXS|5.0|The original movie with Christopher Reeve sets the standard for all the later ones. This one and Superman-II are just too good to miss. Kids will love it too.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I like the fact that the writers for this show have different themes.  I am so happy there is a show with scientists and engineers that people enjoy watching and is hysterically funny.  The sixth season was no exception and is definitely something to purchase if you are a Big Bang Theory fan.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is the best free application for radio listening thru the internet designed for Android devices.  Excellent quality of sound when using earphones or headphones as well as device speakers.  Plenty radio stations from everywhere to suite your taste and preferences in music and programing. I've been using this application in my other intelligent phone for long time and have no complaints whatsoever. Both the free and pro applications are recommended as  A++++++ :-)
B009MYARIK|5.0|One of my favorite Sophia Kinsella books ever, and I have read them all!  Very funny; I laughed out loud the whole way through.  A great summer read.
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn takes a new approach towards the standard high fantasy genre.  With an ability called Allomancy, certain people burn specific metals that they consume in order to perform incredible physical and emotional feats.  In addition to Sanderson's fantastic world-building skills, the author creates a compelling story full of rich drama, mystery, and personal conflict.<br />The main character, Vin, is a poor street urchin on the verge of womanhood.  Used by miscreants and petty crime gangs almost her entire life, the girl has grown jaded and trusts no one.<br />Kelsier, a powerful Mistborn, is able to use the entire range of Allomantic metals and the corresponding powers they offer.  Armed with his abilities, determination, and a group of like-minded individuals, his main goal is to overthrow the tyrant of the Central Dominion known as the Lord Ruler.<br />This novel kept me up late at night as I continued to read way past my bedtime.  It's so damned good!  The characters are complex, there are several subplots to keep things interesting and flowing, and there are pinches of humor throughout the book that gives some relieving levity in the bleak Dystopia wherein the suffering Skaa must live.<br />I'm sure most fantasy fiction fans have already read and/or heard of this series.  Though I was late to join the bandwagon, I'm just glad that I finally discovered this superb and entertaining author.
B008Q00KEW|5.0|A very compelling storyline combined with some of the best &#34;ships in space&#34; effects make for a thoroughly enjoyable Star Trek experience.  The &#34;new&#34; twist on one of the oldest adversaries of Star Fleet brings a fresh new set of challenges for the crew of the Enterprise.  The acting was great; it's obvious that these actors have become so comfortable with their characters that it's almost second nature.  Overall, one of the better movies in the series.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SONG- &#34;BOYS ROUND HERE&#34;, ON THE AWARDS SHOW, I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH IT. THE VERY NEXT DAY, I ORDERED IT. I REALLY LIKE THE ENTIRE CD. BLAKE IS TALENTED, FOR SURE. IT WAS A GREAT BUY.
193700788X|2.0|Oh, Ms. Harris! What happened?! I don't understand how your wonderful series could go out with such a whimper, but \\"Dead Ever After\\" was truly a disappointment.<br /><br />I will avoid spoilers and just say that the plot line of this book was both predictable (I had a feeling Sookie would be heading in this general direction) and horrendously messy. It seemed like every minor character from the first 12 books made an appearance in this finale, but their stories did not tie convincingly together. And meanwhile, because DEA adhered to the ~350pg size of its predecessors, several of the major characters got short shrift. Sookie makes some serious life changes in this book, but while I appreciate the attempt at character growth, I cannot buy into such a rushed and poorly supported narrative. It didn't make sense, and that's my minimal requirement for enjoying a book. I had hoped for a better ending for Sookie. Although the last couple of books hadn't blown me away (2-1/2 or 3 stars), based on the respectable manner in which Ms. Harris ended her other series I thought she might still be able to pull off a good finale. Unfortunately, I was wrong.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Huge Jack Reacher fan. Wasn't expecting much with Tom Cruise casted as the lead but he was excellent hoping there will be a sequel
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all three seasons in 2 weeks.  I could not get enough!  The story is fascinating, heart wrenching at times and laughing next.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I loved the book, and referred to it regularly while I was expecting. I had high hopes that this would be funny and perhaps nostalgic. Not even close.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|I think this show is fascinating! I would highly recommend you rent or buy the previous season and catch up with this series.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Don't think twice about not getting this album. Every track has meaning and great beats to it. I am new fan of Macklemore. Want motivation. You got to listen to this album!!!!
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat and scared me half silly. lol  but don't close your eyes!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Our 12 year old asked if we could watch this as a family since one of his friends had recently watched the movie with his family.  After the show ended we thanked our son for having us watch this show again after so many years.  I actually think I liked it even better the second time around.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This series had me hooked from the first minute. Even the background for the credits is hauntingly beautiful.The characters are complex - no perfect knights in shining armor here - and the scenery is spellbinding. There is enough &#34;real&#34; history to make it educational,  too. I 've watched the whole season twice,  something I've not done with any other TV series. It's hard to wait for the next season!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Dr pandas supermarket is a great game for kids who want to run their own store. In this game they get to putvitems in the cart,  scan items and mop the floor of the store. This is just a few of the games there are many more games that provide kids with hours of entertainment.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've enjoyed every book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, except for this one.<br /><br />Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe how CHEATED I feel!  Cheated of time spent waiting and waiting for this last book, that would wonderfully tie up the series, and cheated of the price I paid for the e-book.<br /><br />Others have said it far better than my clumsy fingers could type: \\"guest appearances\\" of major characters, convoluted story, a sloppy mish-mash!  Sookie deserved so much better than this story.  Heck, we - the paying fans - deserved so much better than this story!<br /><br />There's still time ... I'm going to cancel my pre-order of 'After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse.'  Somehow, I just don't care any more.  :O(
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Did not want to purchase the DVD, but it was good to spend time watching it from the site. Found it intriguing.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is very cool and I'm glad its free.I've. never seen some of these suits before. I hope they are all in the movie
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Thanks for making family movie night on a budget affordable for me and my family.  We always prefer to use your services.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I'm on this diet as I speak. I lost 18 lbs in 3 weeks and still going.<br />This diet works for me and I'm sticking with it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken follet is a master of writting and he demonstrates this once again with this book. i haven't finished yet, but it has the spirit of the last book (which I loooooved). The way he connect stories is great and the way you can picture the world as it was... perfect!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|You will not get a better doco!! And blu ray is superb. We watch it over and over, the whole family love it!!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|loved the film, love the DVD. I own very few films on physical media. this one I wanted to own.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|Looks good and has a face smaller than most men's watches. I own a couple automatic watches and this one has been a disappointment. I noticed the other day at work that I lost 15 minutes. An hour later I was behind 35 minutes. I was constantly moving so there was no excuse.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this series. It's violent, bloody and mindless but I can sit back and enjoy it after a mind bending night at work. (my job is very fast paced and complicated).  I'm just hoping season 4 moves the story along as it's starting to get predictable where it is. without giving anything away they need to move...  I'm just sayin....
B007LE2VDM|4.0|Very good effort on Christina's part. &#34;Distance&#34; is excellent, Jason Mraz is one of my favorite artists and their duet is well balanced and performed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Both my wife and I really enjoyed Season 2 and are looking forward to Season 3. The story is fantastic and not predictable at all so you are always surprised with the twist and turn of characters life and times.<br /><br />Simply a great show and certain a classic.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|In this film, Apatow does a great job detailing real life (as closely as you can on the screen) and presents a story that really makes you feel. I found it easy to identify with the characters. The movie has a nice balance of comedy and drama, crude - as real life often is.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|A great film based on the life  of Michael Oher, very heartwarming.<br />Sandra Bullock makes a perfect  Leigh Anne Tuohy. I highly reccommend seeing this if you have not already.
0790731479|4.0|The movie plays wonderfully, one of my favorite movies. Was not happy with the product at first but wonder book and video has great customer service and was help to help me with the situation.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|This is one of the better albums I've purchased in quite some time. I love it. If there was a 6th star I'd give it.<br />You won't be disappointed. What a unique talent.
B002KS1IJC|3.0|Interesting & decent b scifi but don't expect miracles. worth a rent definitely. Creative alien who uses light to lure prey but somewhat nonsensical backstory
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I was very impressed with the soundtrack. they did such a wonderful job with the movie and the musical production.
B008BM9L72|3.0|There are too many explicit sex scenes and the trilogy reads like soft porn. Language is very good. The whole idea is excellent.
B009G78EE2|5.0|From the poignant lyrics to the good beats, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have reminded me that there's still great hip hop being made.  Not only does it have a great beat, some of the songs have great message, such as the track Same Love.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I had read reviews and summaries of this book for years and finally got around to reading it.  It provides a real understanding of why things in history happened as they did, and why certain things are as they are today.  And it provides solid answers to those who mistakenly (or otherwise) believe that certain groups of people are inherently different, less capable, or whatever.  The history of different groups of people are based on geographical, climatic and other environmental fundamentals that have nothing to do with intrinsic capability or intelligence.  A slimmed down version of this should be standard high school fare, in civics, not science classes.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this is a great game.I enjoy playing it on my Kindle or computer.like that I can compete against my FB friends.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I liked the fact that it took place in Norway. Interesting locals. Good translation, but some of the names were difficult yo pronounce.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Maybe I've slowly been converted into having the short attention span of today's youth, but this was too slow...and for some reason a little too annoying...to watch any longer than a few minutes.  I think I really do appreciate &#34;artsy&#34;, but with all those other movies out there only a click away, this didn't grab my attention and make me want to watch.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|I watched it with my family from ages 3-63 including teenagers ...we all loved it. My favorite character was Sandy !
B004N6369Y|5.0|Loved this book.  The story truly took us on the journey of the Hotel and family right from the start.  I could picture the improvements made,  A very compelling story AND by one of my 5 top authors!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Shows the real impact of the tsunami, very heart touching, tear jerker movie. Filmed beautifully. A must see for everyone.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I really like my Kindle case. It is the perfect purple which is my signature and it is durable and stands the Kindle at so many different angles - definitely  meets my expectations!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Well acted.  All of us really enjoyed watching this. Jennifer Lawrence deserved the Oscar. Rent it, you won't be disappointed.
B001QXE0OC|5.0|Selena's first album was good! I totally didn't understand it until like a year ago. This album is all about love, which comes in handy for us teens now! A girl can relate to these songs (at least one) in her own way. My personal favorites: \\"I Got U\\" & \\"The Way I Loved you\\". Enjoy!!  :0
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie!  The story is funny and well written and the animation is fantastic.  I think adults will almost like it more than the kids.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Love her third album! It talks about love and hate and the last song (not remix) moves you to tears. The songs are something you can DEFINITELY relate to one way or another...I did. Have fun!!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|It was way too much singing. I just wanted the characters to talk and not sing so much! Rent something else. The older version of the movie is much better.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Watched an episode with my sister and was compelled to get into this series to know the rest of the story, it was pretty interesting. I don't use cable TV so Amazon Video was the best way to watch. I would never sign up for HBO, you have to drop thousands on a 2 yr cable service subscription at $100+ per month, all to watch just one TV show.<br /><br />As someone who rarely finds cable/satellite/network TV worth watching, this series convinced me to sacrifice an hour per episode of life to the couch demon. It's that good. But it's not good for a family evening of TV. Lot's of nude prostitutes, nude prostitutes every five minutes even, and some serious abuse of women. It's not meant to be in your face, its actually part of the storyline, but not for kids at all.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|More action-oriented than the regular NCIS, but the difference is interesting.  Entire cast interesting;  makes one wish there really WAS an agency who took the world situation seriously.
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|Shower gift for new baby girl. Mother loved Barbies and the 2013 for her new baby is beautiful and will be a memorable doll for year of her birth
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Cast always interesting (and all different), stories interesting, like the fact that there is at least one Federal agency that has ethical underpinnings. Mark Harmon a terrific leader, even though he crosses the line sometimes to do his job.  We need more real Mark Harmons... not the sycophants that really do run such agencies.  PS  Addition of Ziva a few years back really enriched cast and the possibilities of story lines.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The only thing that could be better is releasing app updates for all devices on the same day. I get same day updates on my phone where this app doesn't update on my kindle fire for almost a week after everyone else. This makes it hard to play or even make trades for the rooms.<br /><br />**Note...auto updates are turned on and manual updates have been done.
1401937268|4.0|I have been working with Tarot cards for about 30yrs. These have such a gentle energy! I love the artwork. I pulled away from Tarot readings (doing mostly direct communication as a medium), but for myself or people close to me....cards are great. The only thing I don't like about these cards is the size. They are super large! A bit difficult to shuffle the way I like. Imagery is perfect for those who communicate direct with spirit, moreso than literal card meanings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazon doesn't know when you have already purchased a Trilogy and will sell you the individual books if you are not alert.  I purchased this thinking it was and additional book that I hadn't read.  That's ok I enjoyed re reading it anyway.
1452115567|5.0|This book is delightful.  The photos are wonderful and the commentary well written.  This book has brought many smiles to me and my daughter.  Maddie is something special and I cant wait to see more of her.  I hope a book 2 is in the works!
B001WCN23W|1.0|Album = 5/5.  Remaster = 0/5.  Get the SHM Platinum CD which is still in print, or get the older 1994 Virgin remaster or original 1980s CBS disc.
B009JZVT70|5.0|What a great twist on age old fairy tales. We hope this get's renewed in some form. You never know what the producers and writers will come up with on this unique show.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it. Cool game. You can get all the armors in the movie it just takes a while to collect them but I like how there are so many medals and awards for completing tasks.
B009AP4MGE|5.0|For 4 seasons now my wife and I have enjoyed this show. We are glad to see it has been renewed for 2 more seasons.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born To Run was suggested to me several months ago, as I was transitioning to running in minimalist shoes. I didn't have the opportunity to read it right away, and man! I wish I had. What an awesome book - a great story of the Tarahumara, but also fascinating in it's presentation of the history of the modern running shoe, and of research that shows we are all really \\"born to run,\\" without all of the trappings we've been led to believe we can't - or shouldn't - do without. Fabulous read! I couldn't put it down.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really liked this book. The story is interesting and the plot has enough twists to keep you hooked up to the very last page.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We watched this with our kids and there was something for all of us.  For us parents, there were references to the video games we played as well as references to the newer games the kids play!  Humor was age appropriate.  Would recommend for all ages.
B00942Y94I|5.0|Added Twilight to my chic collection. Watched and own the series. Love the movies and the book series. Have purchase several Twilight collectables!!!
B007XAYKX8|5.0|Is a great movie for motorcyvle racing lovers...is a must see and shows clearly all the challenges as pilot...yoi have to see it!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Super in HD. Very well done and a super story and message in the script for all to follow in life. Highly recommend!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I don't like books with graphic violence.  The summary of the book never mentioned anything about an abusive husband....I never would have bought it if it had.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Husband and I seen it in the theater and then on amazon. i will be buying the dvd soon.<br />Must see!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|You have to read all the bookss in the series to get a flavor and understanding.  But if you do, you want more.  Too bad the author passed away before writing more books.  Just a great read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett weaves a fascinating story through a turbulent period in the world's history.  This book is better than the first book of the trilogy.<br /><br />Very worthwhile reading
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I hav had this book on my to read list forever. Ever since I saw the cover. i didn't knwo what to expect and man let me tell you, you have to read it. I'm in Love with Travis. The way things went felt real. After you read this read Walking Disaster, yes it's a retelling of the story in a lot of parts but I love getting inside the guy's head.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Decent movie. Helps pass time if you at home bored.  Only rent if you seen all the new movies as a last resort
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I am glad I went with this case when I got the kindle fire. I really like being able to rest the kindle in its standing position as it makes reading in bed a lot more comfortable. Flipping it to landscape or back is really easy and smooth. If you're buying a kindle and considering a case I totally recommend it.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Good movie!! Good action and like the old setting. Could of been a lot better though.  All Around its worth renting
B009GX69RK|5.0|I absolutely love this show. All the characters have great chemistry with each other. I buy all of the episodes so i can watch them over and over.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Loved this movie! It had a great message for all \\"wall flowers\\" in the world. Don't miss out on this great lesson!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I Loved it. A friend told me about it, and once I srarted reading it, Icouldn't put it down! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone - especially if you are an animal lover.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This really made this clear for us! We know one another better now. If you are have issues or just want to under your mate better read this book.
B00ALCBTWU|5.0|i purchased this for my husband for a gift and was very happy that it was less expensive than in the local stores. My husband really liked the movie and has watched it several times already.
193700788X|5.0|I read this in about a day, I just didn't want to put the book down! Love it! Hope to read it again soon.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This series is so well-written and intricately produced. The characters have depth, love or hate them. (Travis Fimmel is SO hot as Ragnar! ) Each episode is absolutely riveting!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Of course the ending was not how I wanted, with her ending up with Eric or as a vampire. It was still a heart pounding read for me. I couldn't put it down and was disappointed when I had to. Highly recommended by this daycare provider, mother and wife.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Pink's music really speaks to me, but I didn't know which album to buy.  When I saw this compilation of greatest hits, I thought I'd give it a go, and I'm very happy that I did!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The artwork was amazing and the story great. The only problem is the disc catches on either DVD machine I used. I noticed this with my daughter's copy also. I hope another episode of the same quality will be available soon. Adele
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Makes it easy to keep up with my Bible study and with daily reading.  Very simple to use and very helpful!
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This was the best movie that I've seen in a long time. Great performances by the whole cast. You laugh and want to cry all at the same time. Romantic and fun.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Eric Clapton knocks it out of the park again with this latest release.  I continue to enjoy listening to the entire thing - no skipping songs - it's all perfect!
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|I enjoy films about people with &#34;mental issues&#34; in general.  Nothing too inspiring in this one, but the acting was great.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Easy flowing, yet informative. iT REMINDED ME WHAT IT REALLY TAKES TO BE A TEST PILOT AND/OR ASTRONAUT. Would highly recommend it.
B00AYLTMMM|3.0|What this wonderful, warm-hearted man really needed was affection; he really didn't seem to have much trouble in the 'sex' area, other than sadly, lack of experience.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I like it because it is fun and challenging.  Also it was free so woo hoo.  Good graphics, fun, challenging. Yay
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Enjoyed every moment of this imaginative story -- 3D effects and computer graphics were wonderful and the story touched my heart.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Such a great story about love and new beginnings! I recommend this book-an easy,quick read.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Sorry but as a professionally trained classical vocalist it was literally torture to listen to this collection of wobblers and squeakers!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this game is so addicting and you end up playing it all the time and eve spending real money on it for it to just crash on you. It WIL crash, believe me. So much of my time has been wasted playing this game. And Gameloft doesn't care. their customer support is horrible. They always have bugs on it... just don't waste your time!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Enjoyed this from start to finish and am looking forward to the next installments.  Not being a purist, I didn't mind that fact that the story has been drawn out and expanded from the book version.  3-D was fantastic.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I live in a tropical country, so the regular temperature of my room was messing with the performance of my computer. I got this Cooler and the temperature drop about 20 degrees. It's easy to install, just make sure you have enough space in your case.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|A bit surprised to see this win Best Picture, but it was nonetheless, well acted and a very good rendition of a story that was covered up for far too long.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. It is nice to have some thing to watch that is not full of sex or violence.
B00B8ESWAM|3.0|Hoffman and Phoenix give very convincing performances, it's just difficult to figure out what they're trying to convince us about????
B00138H68M|5.0|great album.  I am now interested in getting some of their other works.  Julian Casablanca's voice is mellow and soulful, backed by basic yet catchy riffs
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a lot of fun and it very different and it can be played by all ages and it very east
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am a big fan of this entire series. I really like some of the new capabilities that have been introduced to the game. CTR still as much fun as always.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I loved the entire theme of the movie, the actor and actress-both couldn't be better for the part. The music score was right on.  I even bought the song to the movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The only issue I have is that sometimes with the &#34;quests&#34; I do what is necessary to complete them; but the game does not recognize them as having been completed. Otherwise, it is a nice way to spend a bit of time.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like Bingo Blitz to the point where I almost love it.  My only problem is the gentleman speaks way too fast.  But other than that it's a great game.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This novel seems to be very overrated by readers.  Like everyone else, I enjoy a good storyline.  This one was very predictable and I found it difficult to actually like the main character, Victoria.  She does not seem to be human enough, and sometimes she is even crass (the way she eats).  Overall, this story is just okay.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This was terrible. I had a hard time finding words because it dose not have any why of finding what letter you are on you kinda just have to guess.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is terrible!!! It crashes on me every 30 mins!!! I'm on Facebook a lot but this the only app for my Kindle sometime I just have to use the web instead of the app because it always pops up that &quot;Facebook has stopped&quot; or &quot;Facebook is not responding&quot;!!!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Glad to be able to use technology like this free for up to 250 songs.  Doing this is new to me.  I recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's for teenagers, but I couldn't put it down.  A little gruesome or too much for younger ones at times, but fascinating.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|I know many didn't like this tale. They wanted old familiar stories. But I quite liked this. I liked what he did. He got everything right actually. Faerie has never been a nice place and too much has been sugar coated or watered down. Mr. Gaiman has shown us the power again.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Not particularly memorable, but it was a cute rendition of Rapunzel and an interesting rendering of the 'mother'/daughter relationship.  Her hair kept changing lengths, but, hey, it's a cartoon.
B00190N4E4|5.0|Gandhi was certainly a remarkable man.  I honestly had no idea how inspirational he was in changing the lives of so many people.  I highly recommend that EVERYONE [Adults and Children] watch this wonderful movie.<br /><br />May God Rest His Soul And Keep Him Smiling From Above, Always.
B004NS710C|5.0|This movie is awesome. Denzel gives another award winning performance and this is Tony Scott's last role as director. This movie makes you feel every twist and turn of the story!
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|It's an alright movie. The concept was different. Worth a rental, but glad I didn't see it in the theatre.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|This game is a good product to use up some of the time I have to do nothing.I am retired and have a lot of time to do things that are interesting and this fills some of the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but how to update it if I plz tell me plz plz plz ppl z tell me I NEED TO KNOW.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very entertaining! You can make it as challenging or easy as you want it. You'll enjoy the app of Solitaire!  Get playing today!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Watched this after seeing season two and liking that a lot. Season one was good but very disappointed in how the wrapped the story up. Last episode was almost silly, they could have done better.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|You must listen to this album at least 5 times, just to begin to get it. Its his best ever. It's a lot of music. A lot of sound and great writing. Every song is different from the other. Bowie covers every style of sound and blends it into a great piece of work.
B009R659L8|5.0|I think I may have read all of her books and thought this one especially great!<br />Can't wit till her next one comes out!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie.. Jamie fox, Leo.. great performances all the way around.. I would recommend it for sure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game I love it and my family loves it too. The graphics are good. Five stars. Great game for kids..
0515142247|5.0|This novel grabs your attention and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  I did not want to put it down!
B000OVLINI|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much!  The plot was beautifully written, and the characters most interesting.<br />Our book club read this book, one of our best.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|If you are like me you will LOVE this game for the following reasons.<br /><br />1. The hint button. If you are not sure in what direction you are to go next it will tell you without any penalties. It also will help you out of any problems you may have.<br /><br />2. The videos are NOT real people but are cool animation graphics.<br /><br />3. More than one person can play the same game signing in on their own name.<br /><br />4. Also all the other stuff you come to expect.<br /><br />I would advise that you go to Artifex Mundi web site where you can find the other games they have made under G5 game name as well. These are by FAR THE BEST H.O.G.  that are out there. One word of warning though........if you are like me (and I can admit it - you don't know me) and you need a good hint button then these are the ONLY ones you will want to play.<br /><br /> I have already purchased all they have available and I have not even finished all of them yet. I only wish that the sequel to this game was available now. I CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!<br /><br />In their other games, their hog games also include where you have to make what you are looking for. For example, in one game you were looking for a loaded gun. This was in a different color then the other items. You had to find the bullets drag them over to the gun, then pick it up. Another said negative picture. You had to hit the button on a Polaroid camera and hit the picture before it developed. I don't want to give any others away but there have been even cooler and tougher ones.<br /><br />I have been able to get thru all so far without using the hint button (knock on wood). But LOVE LOVE LOVE the hint button  to show me where to go next  when I have either forgotten where my new item in inventory goes or when I want to make sure I am going in the right direction.<br /><br />I really hope this helps you and by the way I am playing on a Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;.
B00932A4XE|4.0|If you don't want to watch a serious film, just want to be entertained, then this movie is good. Don't think it really will tell you about pregnancy though. Watch it to laugh and cry.
B005PK553C|5.0|Magnetically engaging, from the first moments when the creepy tweens appear, lisping through their braces, up to no good, chastened by the mongoloid-Cassandra neighbor girl. And, the disturbing eeriness lasts, unabated, through the final, 12th, episode. Kudos to everyone involved, especially Jessica Lange.  What brilliance!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Waited years for this ... and it was worth the wait!! This is Rod at his best. Every Rod fan should buy this, old fan or new this is a must have!!
B008NW67E0|4.0|It took me awhile before I could listen to the album the whole way through, then I figured out my problem: The first song, Babel, makes me feel like I'm being yelled at and that feeling sticks around for a few songs.  So now I just skip the first song and enjoy the rest of the album!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The book dragged. The action was boring and only resulted in death after death, where the author tried to outdo herself as she killed off the characters- \\"how much more atrocious/disgusting can I make the next death be?\\"<br /><br />Katniss was a drug induced mess. Peeta was a crazed maniac. And the redeeming characters that had found some sort of happiness and purpose in life, die. It was all very inspiring (sense the sarcasm). And the happy ending we thirst for since The Hunger Games, well it was stale and not exactly happy after all. Big let down.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The story has a uniqueness and the visuals (HD) are amazing. My kids were mesmerized the entire time. Definite thumbs up.
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly keeps hitting home runs.  I never want Harry to retire.  How does that work.  Another thoroughly readable, fast paced and intelligent work.  Keep it up and don't let Harry go
B0053O89KG|5.0|i love castle - i am going to get all the season as soon as i can  - i would recomend it to everyone - its one of the best shows on tv i don't know of anything i don't like about it - but becket better not leave castle - they just go together
B0017R5UA0|2.0|My dad insisted one year that they don't make good folk music on vinyl any more, as he fondly stroked his collection of Kingston Trio albums. So when I saw this I snatched it up as a Christmas gift for him. &#34;Here ya go, Pop. New folk music on vinyl.&#34; He eagerly tore off the outer plastic wrap, inhaled the bouquet of freshly pressed vinyl and put it on his turn table. We listened to both sides over dinner, and I asked, &#34;Still say they don't make folk music on vinyl any more?&#34; He pauses a second and replies, &#34;I said they don't make GOOD folk music on vinyl.&#34; Can't please 'em all. To his credit, he liked the main hit off the album but felt the rest of the album was A-tonal, with all of the songs sounding alike.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app seems to be the most accurate for the area I live in.<br />I would recommend it to friends.
B00BIRRDZ4|4.0|Another fantastic record from one of my favorite bands. Can't wait for the next three. Keep it up you guys.
B009AMANH4|5.0|My wife loved this movie.  We can see how Daniel Day Lewis received an award for the part that he played.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|If you get queasy easily, this is not for you. It's easily the most graphic show I've ever seen on TV, and it's not sex that's scandalous this time (unlike every other show).<br /><br />Hannibal is brilliant, edgy, and intelligent. It's carefully paced and doesn't oversaturate you with characters. Rather, it takes intimate care of a select few that are endlessly fascinating. It does a great job of letting you occasionally love the bad guy and hate the the good guy. I'm praying they get the greenlight for season 2.
B0000714BP|4.0|Every time I think of Patrick Swayze's passing it saddens me.  Partly because we were about the same age and I saw his abilities mature.  Anyone that followed him from [[ASIN:B0095D5454 Red Dawn ('84) [HD]]] to [[ASIN:B0002J58GU King Solomon's Mines]] knows what I mean.  This is one of the comedies he made and it is a good one. Suffice it to say RuPaul was probably laughing his head off as Swayze, Leguizam, and Snipes play drag queens on a road trip to a beauty contest.<br /><br />Recommendations: [[ASIN:B004AZKI6W The Birdcage]], [[ASIN:B000LJJI6C Victor, Victoria]], and [[ASIN:B006RZZC3C The Crying Game]].<br /><br />CA Luster
B009LMTDL0|5.0|After reading many articles about this book, I finally decided to purchase it.  I'm only half-way through and have already purchased it for two other women.  Sandberg provides real-life examples about women in the workplace and is inspiring for those people who need just a little push.  I highly recommend this.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Seriously the best show ever! they do such a great job with the cast and story line you are always interested and sitting on the edge of your seat! Amazing show love it
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Awkward went from guilty pleasure to proud pastime over the course of the first season. Good young actors brilliantly pulling off the colorful characters that populate the Awkward universe. Well written but quite frankly terrifying, I don't have any kids and I feel like it is corrupting the youth. Oh well still good.
B002RT5SR2|1.0|It is a wonderful movie but the Amazon Prime version does not play.  I cannot recommend anyone purchasing it because it just does not work. I got the movie elsewhere after paying Amazon.
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|i like progressive games with a goal at the end. i  will beat it but it is nothing special if it wouldnt have been free i would not have been happy with my pearchas
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|&quot;CALCULATOR PLUS FREE&quot; even holds &quot;MEMORY&quot; numbers while you're multi-tasking elsewhere on your device, until You &quot;ALL CLEAR&quot; them&hellip;<br /><br />GBJ
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child's story was compelling and the suspense grew from the opening pages.  The descriptions of Reacher and how he was feeling in certain stressful situations was dead on and i couldn't put the book down.
B0011TNVLY|4.0|I am so glad I ordered this item....my daughter loves the movie and when winter hits that's all she will watch. Now she can watch the movie on the go not just in the car in her dvd player but while she is in the store.
B006TTC54A|5.0|It is good to finally have this movie in our collection.  It will be enjoyed for years to come! Great purchase.
B001KT6JPA|2.0|Drags out with very little going on for the first hour and a half. Don't expect it to be anything like Silence of the Lambs.
B00684J49U|5.0|This was a Christmas gift, my daughter has the complete sets from the past seasons. Will be ordering more, for<br />many Christmas's ahead!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins are a great duo in this movie. It's rare that a movie can keep my interest for the entirety, but this one did. I really enjoyed the little comical scenes between Gosling and Hopkins. Great thriller movie that keeps you thinking through the whole thing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A very addicting game. Will definitely twist your brain a little. Can't wait for the next game to come out. Will be trying it out.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  It is fast paced  and the graphics keep changing so you never  know how the each run will go.  You will not want to put it down.  Yes , I would recommend this one .
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|Obviously, The Truman Show was much more engaging and surprising when it first came out. What was so shocking back then is barely a stretch today. But the movie holds up all these years later. Jim Carrey and Laura Linney, especially, are really good in it.  And my 13 year-old enjoyed it!
B007N8RULO|3.0|This one is great if you like  card games.  I am use to playing it with 4decks so this is not a challenge to me.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|One of the best tv series made!!! We are working on the series, one season at a time, and season 3 is great!!! Sheldon is a riot, and is always good for a laugh!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The colors are amazing the graphics aren't too bad. On point at best. Plus my kid loves it...and its addicting to us parents as well. :)
B009RH9FR6|4.0|It works pretty well except that the stand angle is too upright for easy viewing when set on a table or counter.  I like the rotating feature as I can either protect the ports or have them available when the case is closed as needs be
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book is written well and definitely kept my interest. I also like the fact that it is so real and believable. It also has a great twist towards the end. It's the story of a terrible childhood that scars a man forever. But eventually he finds a way to make sure the scars can't hurt him anymore. This book is definitely worth reading.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!  Now my favorite book of all time, I wish I had read this ten years ago!  Michael Lewis provides a detailed account of the machinations of a revolution in baseball.  Maybe of greater significance is the abstract application of rational data analysis to attain optimal, efficient outcomes in market driven systems and potentially non-market centric systems (read as Government).  While not necessarily a management panacea, the potential is compelling.  A must read for any aspiring leader, manager or change agent inspired to upset the status quo.
B004Q9T4E4|5.0|Clear concise logical. A superb read for all interested in how we got to where we are. I am delighted to have discovered Niall Ferguson
B0054SMIH6|5.0|It was awesome and I enjoyed it alot, too bad Hollywood doesn't make more movies like this.  It was suspensful, but a bit predictable.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Like most readers of the Wheel of Time series I've been reading the series for decades - literally. That said, I was still sorry to see it end. Sanderson did a very good job of picking up for the deceased Robert Jordon. The final installment felt a little choppy but that's what happens when you try to tie up all the loose ends (well almost all the loose ends). Regardless, the book was very good, and as all of us would hope in all situations - good...  No spoilers here, very good book.
1476734941|5.0|I found this diet extremely easy to follow and I don't mind the fast days at all, in fact I look forward to them.  I've lost 7 pounds in 3 weeks.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|Never downloaded. downloaded reason why. Should come on the Kindle. It's free anyway. So many of the picture/or movie items need the players.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very  easy to use app and I enjoy playing it whenever I get a spare minute or two to play.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Not very challenging. Puzzles are way too simple with too large a pieces. Maybe I just bore easily.  Not much variety either.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|With the exception of the brief nudity at the beginning of the movie (embarrassing when you are watching on a plane with a stranger sitting next to you), this was a good movie and Danzel Washington was great. I suspect there may have been an alternate ending.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Loaded with historical references, artifacts, and action. Located in Washington DC, Langdon has to find the hidden ancient mysteries. Easy read. I rank it up there with &#34;Da Vinci Code&#34; and &#34;Angels and Demons&#34;.
B002APU580|5.0|If you love period pieces and love a good &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending, this is the movie for you.  Many movies, while I do enjoy them, I watch them once and really don't care if I see it again...or at least not for a long time.....this movie, however, I watch every time I see it listed..I love it that much.
0393057658|5.0|Well-written look at the new age of smart GMs.  It didn't all work, but innovation doesn't come unless you study it.  Anybody who enjoys fantasy baseball will enjoy this look at how GMs go about their business.
B004GYY714|5.0|I didn't realize when I downloaded that stations would be listed that I could choose from, I was only trying to listen to one particular station.  I love it...
B007IK44CK|4.0|More about setting than actual missions now, but still a lot of action.  Story could stand to tighten, but if liked previous Mission Impossibles, then this will give you your fill.
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved this book for it's intrique.  I couldn't put it down as the mystery kept pulling me to see if my predictions were accurate.  They were!! I would recommend this to any mystery lover.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I'm a huge Lord of the Rings Trilogy fan and was so excited to hear Peter Jackson was gonna get to do the Hobbit. I was even OK with the relatively short book being made into first two films, and then three. Then I watched it. The production values are incredible, and the whole world is believable, but it just doesn't seem to matter. The stakes are low in this one, well when compared with LOTR. There are too many Characters, seriously I can't name a Dwarf from the film. I understand they are important, but I can't remember them.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Super cute movie! Great animation features in this film. The boogeyman may be a little scary for younger than 3 kids but my 4 year old loved the entire thing!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A pretty decent adaptation of the source material, aside from the obvious joke about everyone looking well fed. Things happen in a different sequence than the book sometimes, and a lot of back story is left out, but to be expected for the launch movie for this franchise. Jennifer Lawrence really carries the whole story on her shoulders. Aside from Woody Harrelson and little thor, much of the cast is only passable.  Can't wait for the sequels!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Loved this movie. The story is compelling with some very provocative questions.  The acting by Denzel is outstanding but the story line is even better.  I think the behavior prior to the crash is seriously exaggerated, but that aside, it works.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I really enjoyed this - am looking forward to seeing a Broadway<br />production it in a few weeks. I know having seen the movie I will enjoy it more so.
B001LOPYHI|4.0|Hokey by today's standards, but a fun watch if you want to see 1970's special effects, acting style and character development (our hero thinks for himself and develops admirable qualities while the female lead is assigned no real personality), and social commentary.  It's always fun to see dated futuristic depictions.<br /><br />Just don't critique it through a contemporary lens, it'll be the lamest movie ever if you compare it to 2012's &#34;Prometheus&#34; or something.
B0097K21YW|5.0|You are a dinosaur and shoot fire at buildings. Yep, pretty fun tho.Also I'ts not like angry birds at all. Only similar aspect is the shooting stuff to get points.
B002BEJ3BK|4.0|The vinyl arrived warped causing skips. This is probably due to being a low quality pressing as evidenced by the price. As a result, I do not recommend buying it vinyl version of the album.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter never disappoints, always surprises and provides endless jaw dropping, ‘No S***’ moments! The mix of humor, suspense, drama, mystery and a 'splash of repulsive' makes Dexter the perfect thrill ride.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I could forgive Rod Stewart almost anthing. I consider myself a die hard fan, but I just don't get what all the hype is about on this one. I've been looking forward to getting my copy of this album and after listening once I gotta say I'm a bit more than disappointed. I immediately checked the reviews here on amazon. I was thinking \\"man ol' Rod is gonna get shredded for this one\\" I was a little shocked to see such good reviews! The album just seemed to drone on for me. I'll give it another listen maybe my mind will change. I feel kinda bad giving my beloved Rod such a low grade...and who the hell am I to judge...I've never written or performed music in my entire life so I really have no clue what it must be like to pour your heart into making an album only to have some one trash it. I can only imagine that I myself would be completly devestated ! I'm sorry Rod....I do love you more than any other artist.... but this one just didn't take me there.<br />P.S I've put it in my car and listened repeatedly....Of course I've grown to love it.  like I said ...I'm a huge Rod Stewart fan and with me he can hardly go wrong. I've changed my rating accordingly. :)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|If you watched the movie and want to read a book about the exact same story, this isn't what you want. However, if that isn't your concern, then read!! This is a good book. It's written from an interesting perspective which lets you learn more of the truth just as the character does. Read it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I wouldn't have picked this book if my book club hadn't but I really liked it- interesting views on a tragic event. It was a great look into nature vs nurture. It made you think about a lot of real life news related stories, victims and the legal system. The ending left me unsatisfied but only in the way any murder case would even if you think justice is done.
1433515164|5.0|I love my Bible. ESV Study Bible is the way to go! It gives you a lot of information that really helps you understand by showing the context, history, etc. It also has beautiful color maps and pictures of what buildings and towns looked like. The study notes are really enlightening and helpful.<br /><br />If you're looking for study notes that are fluffy and filled with nice, pretty words that make you feel good, this isn't the version for you. There's no fluffing things up or fairy dust in the ESV study Bible. It's truth and notes that help you understand the truth. The good truth!<br /><br />Not to mention, the cover on this particular (hardcover) version is extremely durable. It really aids in protecting the Bible.<br /><br />Like others have expressed, this study Bible is a really valuable resource. Not just for knowledge but for really understanding God and what everything is about.<br /><br />This is simply the best.
0307277887|2.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a book with no depth. It is simply kill, kill, kill, with no side plots and poorly thought out back stories which get very little air time between the snuff. The fact that everything he discovers about the killer is through dreams seems lazy - there is no detective work, he just wakes up with a feeling and suddenly knows where to go.<br />Another thing that bugged me was that Dexter's \\"mask\\" didn't feel very convincing - he still seemed like a massive creep to me when he was being \\"nice\\" - but perhaps I just share Doake's perception skills.<br /><br />For a first novel, it's a good start, but Jeff Lindsay clearly hadn't developed his story telling skills when he wrote this. It remains to be seen if he has improved.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This is a good game except that all the really good content is only available for IOS users. If you run android or a tablet, get used to visiting other players that get all the fun stuff that isn't available, and probably won't be.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|I have heard many of Boz's songs, he is so mellow and easy going.  I especially like to listen to him after a stressful day.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I know this is an adaptation of the book, but I think the story could be told with a little less. Is the whole series going to be 3hr epics? Love the story, but call me old as I just thought it moved a bit slow, and was a bit over aggrandized.
B001JI72AI|5.0|The movie is obviously awesome, having 2 out of 3 elements in my movie evaluation triads (space - explosions - cute girls). Unfortunately amazon instant video compression hates dark uniform backgrounds (like the starry sky) -- they degenerate into dark, greenish areas with visible squares and other MPEG (or whatever DCT-based algorithm the use these days) compression artifacts. That's not enough to ruin the experience but still, this day and age there are ways to prevent it.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|this is a love hate gameship!  really feel nothing else needs to be added , they are so creative they suck you in and giggle on their way out the door!
B007EW9ISM|4.0|This stylus is comfortable. I have noticed that you do kinda have to press to get it to register correctly, but I think that's by design. It was a little pricy for what it is, but it's definitely a good stylus.<br /><br />I bet this would be great for kids, too. It's about the size of a coloring marker, so good for their small hands.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series. I read the kindle edition and appreciated the ability to pull up dictionary definitions for words that I didn't recognize. I seldom give out five stars, so take my four as a very strong recommendation.<br /><br />This is steam punk, set in England in the 1870s, with a strong supernatural theme. It is typical, since the technology used in the story is largely fictional (black box) technology. In other words, it likely would never work.<br /><br />But that doesn't detract from this wonderful series of five books, which tells a much larger story as a collection. Very highly recommended for mature readers and YA who do not mind the erotic elements of the story.
B001IF252M|5.0|These work really well. I've bought several knockoff brands for my company and they always seem to fail, but these official adapters seem to last and last without issue. If you need an adapter like this, just buy this one. It costs more, but it won't fail you in the middle of a presentation like some that I've bought.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show.  Hope they stay together and the show continues for many more seasons.  Not a real tv person, but this show has me hooked.  Stana Katic is mesmerizing.
B0043JDUNS|2.0|Very bad, childish not for anyone over 10 years old, do not rent waste of money and time. Not as good as ironman 1
0984334904|5.0|I really love these cards! It's true, you can made them by yourself, but (and this is a big BUT) these have:<br />1) plastic coated (with rounded edge so less damageable)<br />2) print with clear and green eye-friendly characters<br />3) order stroke (essential!)<br />4) count of strokes (not essential, but nice)<br />5) radical display<br />6) On and Kun reading with useful example compounds
B005RDF2RG|4.0|the whole family enjoyed it and look forward to seeing the next one this weekend!  Dreamworks does it great again
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|What a wide ranging collection of narratives with titilating and promising sentiments. Based god would be proud of this guy. What a charming read…swag.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There are better things to do with your time. This is the kind of book where you get annoyed with the characters and roll your eyes at some of the stuff they say. But you want to know what happens and so you keep reading. Then once you finish it you realize that getting to the end wasn't worth putting up with all of the s***** writing it took to get there.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Intriguing concept that keeps reader engaged.<br />The ending is a bit abrupt and more detail about the psyche of the mom would have helped
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The movie turned out to be much more than expected. From the start, you think it's one way, by the end, totally another. You gotta watch this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was pretty explicit, but I loved the way the story changed from a sordid relationship to a love story. The transformation was<br />amazing and made me feel that love can always find a way, no matter the obstacles. It was fast paced and really held my interest.<br />Granted this may not be for everybody, but for me it was a book I just couldn't put down. When I finished this book, I immediately bought and started the next one.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is wonderfully rich in imagery, that can captivate the reader.  The p story of manic and love present precious messages about life - timing, love, opportunity, performance, performance, destiny, and so much more.  It is the kind of story I wish I could have read in an English literature class in college.  The only thing that I thought it lacked was a little bit of a clearer explanation of what the heroine tried to do at the end.  At times I wished the characters were slightly more developed, but overall, I thought the level of development was right for the feel or kind of tale the author constructed. If you love tales of unrequited love, and magic, and destiny, and don't mind lots of incredibly rich scenes and images described - which to me, is what made this book so nice, this is worth reading.  I will never think of the circus or illusions --or magic -- the same way again.  It is a book not to be rushed or skimmed.  Savor it like a memento of a lost love.<br /><br />This book could be an amazing movie, if it is kept true to form.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I actually saw Alfred in person back in 1968. Anthony does not look the same, but his portrayal of the man was excellent.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I really love this series and watching it with the family. Just as awesome as the last season and cant wait for the next one to come out on DVD
B001KZG99A|5.0|Enjoyed movie alot! Watched it before seeing the new Iron Man 3. Good family movie, I wouldn't let anyone under 8 watch it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I LOVE this book it's help people lean the meaning of words. I have a question why do it have many more and more and more words can you just send the books?
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Enjoyed movie alot! Not as good as #1 Watched it before seeing the new Iron Man 3. Good family movie, I wouldn't let anyone under 8 watch it.
B009ZM76J2|5.0|This movie was recommended by a close friend. It spoke to my heart concerning my relationship with my friend. I realized that for many years now we have been Molly to each other during difficult times in our lives. If you are one who is open to receiving messages from God in many ways and forms I recommend this movie highly!
0061339202|5.0|Flow created a new way of perceiving how I can interpret life. Excellent book for intellectual stimulation. It is a must read
B00B2PO148|5.0|This book is a must but not just deadspace fans, but those who enjoy sifi and also awesome but disturbing monsters artwork.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Although the cast is great the script is not funny enough. The movie does not decide if it wants to be a comedy or a drama.
B008SJH05S|5.0|Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's a cute game. Actually my mother in law had come over and I didn't realize my daughter had downloaded it on her tablet. So I had my daughter download it on my kindle so that my mother in law could play. Actually my husband and I liked it too.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like the app a lot because it has lovely graphics and music. And if you are patient you can play without buying any algae, pearls,etc. However, it takes a long time to get enough points to go from one level to another as you get to level 17 and above. I haven't made it past 17. But I do enjoy it and find it a great mindless way to pass the time as I wait for doctors, etc. Or just need to calm down a bit.
B0097K21YW|5.0|This is not a direct ripoff of angry birds. It is a angry bird style game with an awesome twist. You are timed on the destruction of the map. There is even a sweet survival mode. You get unlimited fireballs and enhance them by destroying crates.  Different elements help make the bonus destruction. Much to enjoy.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Delivery over stream from Amazon was great. We watched this movie right after watching Iron Man 3 just to refresh our memory about previous chapters in the saga.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good show, good content, intriging. Don't understand the obvious bashing of Christanity in the later shows.  Will continue to watch unless it turns into soap opera or really turns on religion.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Ever wait in line and the person in front of you takes the longest time to make up their mind what they want? Have no fear...there is someone out there killing these people for WASTING TIME...This book had me from the first page and each chapter got more interesting as it went along. Some details of the killing are a bit gory but the story behind it is amazing....Follow Detectives Max and Jesse and see how they catch this killer.....and even find out a surprise or two.
B0053TWVDC|5.0|I loved this movie! It was awesome and the twist at the end was perfect. Definitely recommend it for anyone interested in originals rather than remakes.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|There are days when I don't want to read a book, sit through a heavy movie and need something light to have dinner with and enjoy until I go to bed.  At 67, my evenings are short and these are ideal companion movies for a &#34;light evening&#34; when there is nothing on the other media and it is so easy to enjoy these thrilling stories and well done special effects.  Milestones of cinema and enjoyable time and time again.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|This version of the Austen novel is perfect for all who have actually read the book.  Too many watch the movies, especially the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle presentations, and base their opinions.  Do not mistake my meaning, I absolutely love Sue B. and Andrew D.! However, Powell did a splendid job of directing this realistic country-set film that I have enjoyed several times.  Elizabeth Garvie performed well and I would not be opposed to see it again!
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|I think this is my third copy that I have gone through, lent and not gotten back.  Just a delightful movie - clean fun, and just the sort of thing to pop into the player when I just want some mindless fun upbeat movie after a long day.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|GREAT movie!  It had a little bit of everything for everyone.  I laughed and cried!  I will watch this again.
B00CCZ4BFQ|4.0|I was alive and kickin durng the Hair Metal hey-day. I was not a fan of that genre. I dug Bad Company and Boston...Slayer and MegaDeth. I was also discovering Clapton and SRV. Let me say that I stumbled upon this release by accident..and if you are familiar with Mr. Keifer than I guess you dont need to read this. If youre uninitiated do yourself a favor and click purchase. You'll dig it. Just great Rock and Roll.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|I always rent movies because I never watch them twice. I'm just to busy to sit still that long.  I sat still through this movie twice in the same 24 hours.
B0094LY88G|5.0|Takes more than one viewing to see how it applies to your business.<br />Good training for all your team sales or not....
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Great excuse to sit still and chow down on some popcorn.  I love to watch period movies for the interesting clothing.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|It was okay.<br />Maybe I didn't have reason or context to bond/sympathize with characters...<br /><br />But seemed like just a story about two semi-messed up people.<br />Not crazy messed up... but messed up.<br />Not a crazy plot line... mainly predictable.<br /><br />Was the acting good... yeah, but the story wasn't that interesting.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I just love Cher and would watch anything that she is in.  The dancing and singing in this film were amazing!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved it... loved the casting... loved the acting...<br />A super action filled plot...<br /><br />Was it a little over the top in certain points?  Yeah, of course... so was every other Star Trek movie.<br /><br />Wife like it too though... and she isn't a Trekkie at all.<br />Look forward to more movies with this cast.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love all the characters  and cannot wait to see the next season.  I wonder what will become of this larger group
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Excellent piece of software..Gives me complete control of my PDF files.  Would buy this even at a higher price.. Great for the price.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I found this game to be very challenging as the levels progress, and continue to play it often, trying to beat my own scores!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We are huge fans of The Good Wife.  Such a blend of characters you don't see on any other show.  There is always a new problem  usually stemming from problems seemingly solved in earlier episodes.  I love how some of the characters revolve in and out .  It keeps the show very fresh.  Juliana's approach to Alicia is so understated but you can feel her passions simmering in every move.  Awesome
B008J34466|4.0|Like the CD.  Wished that I ordered the edited version (explicit lyrics not suitable for young children or some of us a bit older...language a bit strong.  Perhaps fun when out with a group of folks, but not so much enjoyable when listening solo; some songs almost offensive.  Still, Love Pink, just wished I'd made a more careful selection when purchasing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging without being impossible. So worth what I paid- 1.99. Probably took a couple hours to complete. I needed the hints but didn't need a walkthrough. Very creative, played perfectly on my kindle fire. Will play again
B006AN78XS|5.0|In the style of classic Woody Allen films, I love the spontaneous dialogue between the characters in this film. For anyone who loves to wander the streets of Paris - or just imaging they are - this film brings back fantastic memories. What fun it would be to step into another time!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series is smart, funny, witty, and truly has an unexpected answer to all. What I love is the balance of great acting and writing to really make this series stand out and truly alone.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This is a story that should be told to all physically challenged people. That life maan change them y have given you lemons but you can change them to cherries.<br />Helen Hunt is fantastic (my favorite actress). John Hawked was even better.<br />watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
B004HMQ7BI|4.0|This movie is a fun little romantic comedy with a beautiful background setting. Faith (Marisa Tomei) has been waiting for her soul mate Damon Bradley since girlhood; a name she gleened from an Ouija board game with her brother. This name was confirmed by a fortune teller soon after. When he calls out of the blue one day Faith drops everything, even her soon-to-be wedding, to go to Italy to find him. A hilarious chain of events ensues, keeping the viewer engaged and cheering for Faith right up to the end.  Italy is the perfect romantic backdrop for this film. I particularly enjoyed it since I would like to travel to Italy someday.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved the original Temple Run, but I actually find this one almost too hard.  You need some incentive to keep playing and it makes me a little dizzy :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was a great season and the viewing quality was fantastic.<br />I would highly recommend this season for your viewing pleasure.
0739375970|5.0|I'm always eager for the latest installment of of well-loved series.  I bought the written form of this book the week it came out, and purchased the audio version so my husband could enjoy it, too.  He travels a great deal.  This series is, hands down, the BEST fantasy series out there.  George R. R. Martin can write rings around Tolkein, but if he doesn't get off the stick and start cranking out more books, he's going to find that HBO will finish his story for him.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|This was an amazing movie of female strength, resilience, loyalty, and courage.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and will watch it again...it was that kind of unforgettable movie.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|The wife was a more crazy one in this family although both the husband and the wife are going through mid-life crises.  It was a funny movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its actually kind of cool a lot of you guys would like I mean I lobe it but we have different intellect
B000SGGUWS|3.0|As I wandered through the hallowed high school halls, with a target on my back, being judged and ignored in equal parts, feeling like a space alien with three heads, my shoes squeaking on the hard linoleum, scared that I would be stuffed in a locker before third period and left for three more, I tried to picture a happier place and time, possibly being stuffed in a wooden coffin and buried six feet under, or chained to a basement wall by my ankles. No, high school wasn't that bad, but it could have been. Hormones raging like a banshee, peer pressure intercepting you from four directions, and the haves conducting their own form of discipline on the have nots certainly makes for a warped alternate universe, one that I am glad I can safely put in my rearview mirror.<br /><br />If not for high school, though, and the teasing by the jocks and trying my best to blend into the wallpaper, or the painted lockers, I wouldn't be the person I am today. But for Spencer, Aria, Emily, and Hanna, they are just getting started, and I can't really say I'm envious. Even if I could go back and supposedly be one of the cool kids, I'd say not just no, but hell no. And then I'd proceed to punch the genie in the mouth and kick him in the balls.<br /><br />Despite the classification for PRETTY LITTLE LIARS, this novel felt more romance than mystery/thriller with all the teenage hormones bubbling to the top of the surface. Romance might not truly fit either because I never realized how much teenage girls thought about sex. I mean, I'm a guy, so we think about sex every 37 seconds. But gals think about it nearly as often as we do, probably about every 77 seconds. They're just better about hiding it.<br /><br />If you like a little Prada or Gucci or Coach, because you live near Saks Fifth Avenue, then this novel is definitely for you. As you pull on your Abercrombie skinny jeans and Von Dutch t-shirt, paint your lips with Chanel lip gloss, drop your Treo in your cherry-monogrammed coin purse, slide on your Miu Miu heels, stuff a Marlboro between your lips, and climb behind the wheel of your BMW, rumbling across the cobblestone streets of Rosewood on the way to your second student council meeting, the first major meeting since you lost the presidential race and ended up as vice-president, you can listen to this breezy read blaring through your bass speakers.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorslide on your Miu Miu heels, stuff a Marlboro between your lips, and climb behind the wheel of your BMW, rumbling across the cobblestone streets of Rosewood on the way to your second student council meeting, the first major meeting since you lost the presidential race and ended up as vice-president, you can listen to this breezy read blaring through your bass speakers.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This is a wonderful and very funny book. It I'd one of the best books I have ever read. :)
076781214X|5.0|This is a diamond in the rough, a delightful movie. No problems with receiving movie in perfect condition and in a timely manner. I loved this in the theater and it translates well to home viewing. This is a very under rated movie, and not to be missed.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My son read the whole book series and loved the movie.  He would recommend it to see!  He said it was &#34;great!&#34;
B009NY43NY|4.0|Oh c'mon people! Everyone is having their little foot stomping tantrums because it didn't end the way they wanted it too! Really? One person even said flat out that Ms Harris \\"just wrote whatever she wanted to\\"...well duh, she's the writer! I would be more dissapointed if she wrote just to please others. And as far as the direction sookie's love life went in, I'm I the only one that saw that coming from book 1? It ended the way it was meant to be with sookie getting the life she always wanted. Ok, I will agree this book isn't as exciting as the others and it felt like it just got started and then it was over. And it was rushed at the end. But over all I enjoyed it.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|Hot Rods first album with original material in probably 20 years. I loved the great American songbooks, but Mr, Stewart hasn't lost his touch at songwriting as he wrote 11 out of 12 tracks on here. It has a good balance of mid tempo rockers and some beautiful ballads,not for a fella pushing 70....def worth your hard earned cash; )
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I wouldn't recommend this, he has had funnier films. i was looking forward to more on the road trip incidents
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a very good program and I am happy that I down loaded it. It works very well with my Kindle.
B00ACFL69C|5.0|McConaughey gives an intoxicating performance as the eponymous character in this blackest of black comedies. Director Friedkin pulls no punches as the family at the center of the story pays dearly for their amoral (and inanely stupid) choices.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a retired trial lawyer I search for but find few novels written from the perspective of an author who apparently has actual trial experience or in depth  knowledge and can carefully present the rapidly moving maelstrom of issues and facts that are presented during a trial yet unforeseen in the preparation phase. Landay did an excellent job in this novel laying the legal foundation. He is a professional.<br />  If the role of literature is to entertain and educate, Landay does both ranking him as an especially good novelist. Not only does he educate us about the social issue of predetermined conduct he also strangles the issue around a family, otherwise innocent, that is completely destroyed by the issue. This part of the novel was gut-wrenching.<br />  Further, the character developments are well crafted as well as the setting.<br />  Yes, this novel is both entertaining and educational and is written in a style easily understandable by the non-lawyer reader.<br />  I recommend it.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|saw on preveiw thought looked good rent at libary and whatched once then played it right away sent back to libary only to rent a few days later great movie
B0094M2SCI|4.0|If you are into vampires and lycans, then like this movie.  It walks on the fringes but overall it's a good movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Loved this show.  The cinematography was brilliant, as is the scriptwriting and the acting.  It seems like it's a bit overkill on the nudity and sex, but the action and suspense scenes are well executed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I bought this on a lark and it was a good choice. I've had a lot of fun playing it and it's a great &quot;I have 5 minutes to kill&quot; app.
B004CMBZJC|2.0|Like Fringe, it has a great premise and cool gadgets.  Like Warehouse 13, it tries to be funny, has a terrible script, and can't really pull off the potential of the premise.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you  like first person shooter games then you'll love this it has the best graphics of all the games I've played on my kindle and when you get it it is beyond indescribable fun. :::::::))))))))):):):):):)):)::)
B009OYSFDM|3.0|As with any comic book show or movie, you know exactly what you're getting with every episode.  It is full of cliches like damsels in distress, starcrossed lovers, and conflicted bad boys who are actually good.  However, the modern twist on a Robin Hood theme is satisfying and the back story about the island and powerful people who control it is intriguing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big fan of John Grisham and have read all his books and this one did not dissapoint.<br />I like books that are not too thick and Grisham has managed to get his thrilling stories out in a minimum amount<br />of &#34;book thickness&#34;.
B008133MDK|5.0|this show is SO clever! it had me laughing and screaming at the telly (as John calls it) and i was so saddened by the ending to the 2nd season. i wish it could last for much for than 3 episodes per season...
B009AMANH4|5.0|Good movie, well made, price is worth it to get the DVD and the Blue-Ray.  Regardless of what side your family was on this how he held the nation together and gave his life for it.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This is Stephenson at his best in terms of characters and finely rendered historical settings. It also presents the challenge in a lot of his work of being *really long*.  But its definitely worth it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Huge disappointment. I have loved this series, but this was just a sad ending. I felt like it was just a parade of past characters with little to no purpose. The plot felt forced and the characters were like cheap imitations of their former selves. I understand that an author has a right to take the story in whatever direction they want. Sometimes a plot twist adds to the story but that was not the case in this series. I'm left wondering what happened to the Sookie and Eric of books past, these were not the same characters. I'm sad to see such a lame effort to wrap up the story in a neat bow. This will most likely be the last book that I read from this author.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|My invariable reaction to any of Peter Jackson's movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's books is to say \\"Well, it could have been worse!\\" And indeed, Jackson's love for Middle-earth is abundantly clear. However, I also say \\"But it could have been so much better!\\"<br /><br />Perhaps it is inevitable that one film's vision of a story so deeply beloved by so many will be found wanting in some particulars.  I count myself among the most enduring and intense of admirers of J.R.R. Tolkien's world, and I must say that I enjoyed large sections of The Hobbit.  I found the Bag End scenes between Bilbo and Gandalf enchanting, and I enjoyed most of the Unexpected Party scenes, though Jackson took some liberties which I found deplorable (croquet balls, indeed!!!!)  Similarly I enjoyed the Rivendell scenes (though where Jackson got the idea that Elves are vegetarians is beyond my comprehension.) Overall, where the film sticks closest to Tolkien's own story it is most successful.<br /><br />Unfortunately Jackson repeats the errors he made in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by focussing on long, violent stretches of battle and conflict. Much of the magic of Tolkien disappears in the sword play.  While I recognize that this was undoubtedly a good box office move, nevertheless I would have enjoyed more poetry and less bloodshed.  But I will watch and enjoy An Unexpected Party and its promised two sequels many times, as always appreciating the true Tolkien bits as pieces of gold among a lot of dross.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This could be so much fun. But,  I have rarely been able to complete a game as it freezes on me and credits I have purchase disappear.  I wish I learned my lesson with the first 235 I purchased but no I was so hopeful that it would suddenly start working as it should.  This is very frustrating and expensive.  Since I have a few credits that haven't disappeared I will try again tomorrow.  BTW, I cannot find any explanations for all the little extra points you can earn.  They seem to have no value
0307388719|5.0|I thought I had reached the zenith of WWII books in the third volume of Manchester's biography of Churchill (written with Paul Reid). Perhaps I did, but Hastings's book is equally as good. First, the book is a pleasure to read, not just because it so often quotes Churchill's writings and speeches, but also because Hasting's style is often lyrical. It's always relevant and concise, but at times, he seems to have been infected with Churchill's facility to charm and inspire.<br /><br />Second, I found that the book answered a question I've been tacitly asking myself since I began reading about Churchill: Why were so many people (Eisenhower, Roosevelt, for examples) impatient with him, his energy, wit, and genius being what they were? The answer is that Churchill had a tendency to overwhelm--to overload those around him; he didn't know when to stop.<br /><br />Not that Hastings dislikes or unfairly criticizes his subject; indeed, the criticisms (often in war strategy) are well reasoned and seem to be justified. In Hasting's view, the criticisms are overwhelmed by Churchill's unique qualities--one man who altered the course of history.<br /><br />If you're interested the Second World War, Winston's War is a must read because it fills in gaps. It's a should read in providing a detailed overview of the war's critical years.
B00499NHLC|4.0|It's told more from watson's view at first and it's a nice change.  Modernized well for a modern England.  Look forward to more.
1616890835|3.0|as a former sign painter I really enjoyed the art work and the interviews with the sign artists. good job!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, was hooked from the beginning.  Very well written and informative. Just absolutely loved it and couldn't wait for next book.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I want to say it's more of the same, but don't think it's just more levels with the same contraptions.  Like &#34;Experiments&#34; there are yet new ways to move through the level including the requirement that you now have two Om Noms to feed.  The only downside I see is that there are now only 15 levels to each pack/chapter/group, versus 25 in the original and Experiments.  Minus 1 star for that.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I think this is their best one yet....I love that I can put on my headphones and get lost in the music
B000AAF1U4|5.0|The movie arrived very quickly and was in great condition.  The emperor's new groove is great and I enjoy it as much as the kids do.
B0075NM8N2|5.0|I loved all the baseball connections & the strength of a person against adversaries, even a young girl.  Good story.
0375869026|5.0|I loved this book!!  My daughter received it as a gift and I read it once she finished it.  It's one of the best books I've read for a very long time and I think it should be required reading for kids in middle and high school.  Excellent!!
B000I5XOVY|4.0|One of Travolta's best films, every well done and never gets old to watch. This was one of the first films we saw Hugh Jackman in, and he was great as was Halle Berry and Don Cheadles--a first rate cast. And the music was excellent. &#34;Misdirection&#34; is abound here, worked into many aspects of the film.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  it's challenging yet not too difficult to play. easy and fun is just the way I like it.  There is enough stress in everyday life.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's a great sci-fi spin on Crusoe. I couldn't put it down. Then I was talking about it to my wife so she read it. Weeks later we still talk about it, especially with all the news about Mars lately.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so dissappointed in this book.Compared to all the rest of the books in this series this was the worst. I totally want my money back.I feel Harris cheated everyone with the last book. I suggest not wasting you time buying it.
B00BJUQP4A|3.0|I enjoyed this book for the pictures of Maddie.  It took a lot to get all the very interesting photos of Maddie.  Those who love dogs would enjoy this.  I gave it three stars because I felt it needed a little more information on each picture.  There is a whole story of how each picture was taken that it would have been nice to hear.  .

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Offering his usual brand of dangerously close to authentic, Max Brooks has once again graced future archaeologists with a problem. Using a modern history approach, the unseen main character interviews participants in the war for their personal accounts of the event from before, during and after perspectives. While this makes for a wonderful, fresh take on the zombie entertainment genre, it has the potential to make future archaeologists lose their marbles like a home-schooled kid on his first day at the playground. Imagine, if you will, some poor little grad student in the future, digging this book out of a time capsule. The joy, the wonder, the published papers, the total lack of corroborative evidence! The student will be pooh-poohed. In an effort to find some shred of verification, grants will be sought and wealthy nuts will be pestered to fund expeditions to find the equivalent of the fountain of youth. The student will end up institutionalized or locked in a well-meaning relative's attic. Oh, Max, what have you done?
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these for my favorite gamer and instantly got Wife of The Year.<br />True story.<br /><br />The compatibility with Windows 8 is seamless, the battery life is more than adequate for CoD/ Borderlands 2 shoot-a-thons, and the sound clarity/quality is terrific.  Yes, you can hear the surround a la &#34;which way is the sniper?&#34;- No, team speak doesn't echo-out.  Lots of customizable features, push to talk options et al., and you can still get up and let the dogs out while plotting your next ground attack.<br /><br />BONUS: easy connection with the USB fob makes going from headset to filling the game room with sound a snap.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Hilarious at every turn. Will be quoting lines from this movie for years to come!!! &#34;Its so FLUFFY!!!&#34;<br /><br />Definite keeper!
B004NOH9LC|3.0|I expected a lot more acting from Diane Keaton, story line a bit slow but the movie was cute and a way to waste just about 2 hours.

B00AJAFNIA|5.0|very unique game. great soundtrack and useful upgrade system. Also a point in beating the game. must buy no doubt.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This a very good book on spiritual life and training. If you want to train your brain for wondrous works, you can try this. It is a good buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a mind blowing puzzle it's very fun dodging in and out of trains jumping over things it's pretty tricky to get tricky and all of the other characters but when you do it's very fun
B007FIY3VW|3.0|The impression I had before buying this product is that I could use basic office tools, especially Power Point after installing it. Unfortunately that was found impossible. It is a disappointing experience.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Awesome movie, watched it twice already. Fan of crime dramas, great story. John Goodman played a good part too. Loved it.
B004JHYRAE|4.0|for anyone considering or curious about the poly lifestyle. Well written and complete information about all aspects of poly relationships and other kinks
B00AA36RZY|5.0|I have never come across a book that has broken down the concept in a manner that so easy to learn and remember. I absolutely loved this book.
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|Thank God it is a free game. It's cute to look at but doesn't really do anything for me. I only played solo, I don't see how playing this game with multiple players would improve it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is so well done, it's addictive! When I watch, I feel as if I have been transported to another time.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I love romantic comedies and this movie did not disappoint. I've watched it a gazillion times on TV and I finally decided to purchase it. It is definitely a keeper!
B003OUXECE|3.0|It's OK for fan fiction. But everything the book tries it destroys with it's tiresome rhethoric and misplaced sense of style. It's full of catchphrases like &#34;nobody messes with X&#34; and the like that made me feel stupid for reading this book.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|The movie was not as funny as the trailer made it out to be.  Glad it was only a rental!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I watched the movie and found it to be very entertaining. I would recommend it to any one with children because it does show you that you cant let people push you around, If you stand up for yourself you can get things done.  Also that honesty is also the best policy, people will respect you for that and stand with you.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Not much of a fan of facebook.  I get on it and look to see who has a birthday and what my kids are up to, but that is about it
B008133MDK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is a most excellent Sherlock ~ the two are well cast and the writing of this series is top notch! I look forward to more...
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Very expensive for what I got.  Plastic.  I rarely use the stand feature because I hold the case to read
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I approached this book with caution given the subject matter, but I was very quickly absorbed by the unique writing style.  Zusak has an incredible way of reflecting the world, of making you completely identify with the characters in the book. One of my favourite reads of all time.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|This is a relatively intelligent show, with some good acting, and an interesting background (made all the more so with recent news about the resurrection of Sanford (although without the support of his wife).  Any way the lead actress Alicia creates some interest as an older female lead as an associated, which compares to the often ridiculous idea in these kind of legal shows that a young hot shot lawyer in her 20s would be trying million dollar cases and murder trials - although there is some of that from supporting actors etc.  She does a good job of maintaining a screen presence not in spite of age and demeanor, but because of it.  The show still has the same ridiculous late discovery stuff that would never be permitted in a real courtroom, but the show is well acted and hearing about the trials and tribulations of a major law is interesting.  A great component is some fun firm investigators who constantly uncover, at the last minute, trial altering stuff, which again would not likely happen but after all this is TV not real life.  The investigator creates a lot of screen interest as a young, tough, sexy, ethnic (it is woven into the show) woman who doesn't share - little bit like the Lizbeth of dragon tattoo fame, but not as edgy.  Eventually I expect this will get old, but we are halfway through this second season, and waning only a little.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I only downloaded this because it was the FAOTD.  I thought it looked like a cheapy clone of some other game based on the screen shots.  The graphics really weren't bad, and the levels turned out to be a lot of fun.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This show keeps my interest from beginning to end!  The cast puts their all into every show, outstanding and exciting!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Was really surprised by this game.  It's a puzzle/matching game of sorts.  The graphics are simple, but well done and pretty neat.  It's a good way to kill some time.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I loved this game bit kept making me go back to homepage when I try to go in. I really hope gameloft fix this.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Wasn't sure about this game, then downloaded it as the FAOTD and really got addicted to it.  Finished the whole game in a few days and kept playing to unlock all the planes.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The writing is great, new way of delivering the story, interesting twist, and also the suspense kept me going. I looked forward to my reading time everyday as the story was really pulling me in, however the ending was very different than I had hoped, it left me feeling unsatisfied. I guess the ending was very unexpected, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the reader!!!!
B0067EKYVI|4.0|Since its original publication in April 1925, The Great Gatsby has received the adaptation treatment several times over its near 90 year history - including in film, television, and theater.  F. Scott Fitzgerald's American masterpiece is regarded as one of the greatest stories in literature, so it's not at all surprising that this story has been tackled so many times.  However, there has yet to be one version (outside of the novel) that has been able to do the story complete justice - and that is largely due to the complexity of the story.  The plot and character details within the novel are beautifully written, and haven't exactly translated well to any other medium up to this point.  Now, here we are in 2013 and the same two men that made Romeo and Juliet hip again, Baz Luhrmann and Leonardo DiCaprio, are back together once more, adapting the tale of Mr. Gatsby in The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />Directed by Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge!), The Great Gatsby stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, the mysteriously rich neighbor of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire).  Constantly throwing elaborate extravaganzas, Jay Gatsby asks the assistance of his neighbor to reunite him with his old flame, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) - Nick's cousin.  Despite the fact that Daisy is now a married woman, Gatsby sets out to reestablish his relationship with the woman he loved and lost, prior to joining the fight in World War I.  Joel Edgerton, Isla Fischer, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />If you've seen the commercials for The Great Gatsby (and the odds say you probably have), you'll most likely have noticed that even though the film still takes place in the American 1920s, the story has been modernly modified with hip-hop music to go along with the glitz and glamour of the &uuml;ber rich New York lifestyle.  Despite the modern additions to this classic story, the fans of the novel can be rest assured that the substance of the story is still intact.  The plot still surrounds the love entanglement of Gatsby and Daisy, all the while still featuring the same important themes (repeating the past and social/class standing) and symbolism (most notably the green light and the watching eyes billboard) of the novel - only with a ton of choreographed dancing and bass pumping Jay-Z music.  Honestly, the music is difficult to deal with in the beginning, but once the film's plot shifts into high gear, the music only adds to the experience and enjoyment...and depending on your music tolerance, you'll either learn to love it, or simply hate it all together.<br /><br />Like the novel and the majority of films, The Great Gatsby features a three part stanza, the first of which centers on Toby Maguire's character, Nick Carraway, and his infatuation with the life of his next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby.  Upon meeting, Carraway and Gatsby's friendship instantly blossoms to the point that Gatsby asks Carraway for help reintroducing him to his cousin and former lover.  The second part of the stanza features the love affair and growing tensions surrounding the consequences of Gatsby trying to make Daisy leave her husband - who has been nothing other than unfaithful to his wife.  In the final portion of the film, Daisy's decision in regards to whom she wants to be with (Gatsby or her husband), along with the car accident and murder, carry you through to the credits.<br /><br />The acting in the film is certainly nothing Oscar-worthy, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby Maguire dominating the majority of the scenes.  These two do a good enough job interacting with one another, DiCaprio always sprouting confidence while Maguire watches in admiration.  DiCaprio gives everything that you'd expect from him at this point in his career, working hard at being the heartthrob.  Maguire, on the other hand, is just along for the ride as a moderately enjoyable moderator, always two steps behind Gatsby, never giving in to the propositions of wealth offered to him.  The damsels of the film, Carey Mulligan, Elizabeth Debicki, and Isla Fisher, each play the part they were cast to play, but none of them are ever really able to emotionally connect with the meaningful substance of their characters.  In the end, the cast could have been better, but each member is able to pull their weight just enough to get the film across the finish line.<br /><br />Overall, the modern adaptation of The Great Gatsby reeks with the same over exaggerated flare that made Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet so popular with teens and young adults.  No, The Great Gatsby will not be for everyone (catering to a younger generation), but it will most certainly bring this classic tale to a new generation and back into the spotlight where it belongs.  At the same time, the film sacrifices plot and character development in order to add dancing, drop more confetti, and submit to the Hollywood style of entertainment.  Still, the scenery is beautiful (even though fake at times), and the heart of the story remains in the right place.  In the end, The Great Gatsby is an alluring plot that will draw you in with its glamorous ambition and leaving you clapping your hands with a final approval and endorsement.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B-<br />FNDNreview.comof wealth offered to him.

B004NOH9LC|2.0|Though I've seen worst, this film was not deep enough for me.  It was too frenetic and fluffy, and completely unbelievable.  Other than that, it was okay.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, expecting it to be something we could read together outside of the normal 7-8 year old selection at the library.  I ended up reading the entire book after she fell asleep.  I love the concept and the ideas behind the unnamed prince and how he views the universe around him.  I especially liked the idea of roses.
B000I9X67M|5.0|A great movie! Reminded me of my college days in the marching band & a grest story that touches on lessons on humility & humbleness! Would recommend to anyone also great entertainment!!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Ironic that DP chose an exploration of the Disco era to reintroduce people to the warmth and depth or &#34;real music.&#34; Hopefully this will force both a reassesment of pioneering acts like Chic and a movement away from laptop driven music production.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The story line is king in this latest incarnation of the Bond tradition. Less gimmiky. Less action for action's sake.  Ralph Fiennes as the incoming M is perfectly woven into the plot.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|That is a teacher, all we need....good teachers. The energy and passion that Professor Lewin trasnmit is vital in a goor class environment
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Though there are references to drug use and infidelity in the movie, it is a sweet story of social misfits finding comfort in each other with a backdrop of summer, boredom and forced activities most people can relate to.  Great acting.  Unique presentation.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I like the game a lot but it has stopped working on my kindle fire three times. Each time I have to start from the beginning.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Loved the idea of watching a good series and learning some interesting bits of history. Would recommend it to a friend
1594489505|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read.  There is actually nothing more to say.  My rating does not need so many words.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This movie never gets old. Appropriate for all ages. Mary Poppins is whimsical and fun. You can sing and dance along with them.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|The latest incarnation of Deep Purple is still smokin'.  Don and Steve are comfortable playing with the others, and vice versa.  There is great chemistry within the group in the studio and live.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|After 9 days with the watch, it is within 30 seconds of where I set it.  It is comfortable and compact ( don't like wearing dinner plates on my wrist!).  Strap is fine, just give it a few days to break in.  Great deal on a watch with a 3 year Seiko warranty.
0920668372|5.0|My 4 year old son is mesmerized by this story. The first time i read it I cried, and my eyes still fill up every time. Very special!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's use of dialogue in this film is unmatched in creativity. christoph waltz' portrayal of SS Hans Landa makes you want to watch the film over and over again.
B00BQHA06A|4.0|I've seen HIM 6 times in concert (2 shows from the last 3 CDs). \\"Tears on Tape\\" might be their most mature album. Stand out tracks are: Lips Go Blue, Tears On Tape, Drawn and Quartered, WLSTD and I Will Be The End Of You.<br /><br />It sounds like a mix of all their albums. Very smart Mr Valo.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is just like the movie the suits and all are awesome I highly recommend it to you. You will not regret getting it
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I'm probably not a good reviewer cause when I love a book I love it!<br />Very long  like all of the other Outlander books but I find myself savoring all the details of Jamie and Clare's everyday lives.  Plus everyone else's lives for that matter.  I feel I  should be keeping notes especially concerning all the plants and spices Claire uses in her medical practice.<br />I know this is a short review.  I could go on and on in detail but I don't generally like to pick things apart.  Same thing if I really like a person, I don't feel the need to nit pick  them.  I just love this book and this series and that is all there is to it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I didn't know what this book was going to be about and once I started reading it, I knew it would be a &#34;Must Read&#34; when I finished this book I told my daughter to read it.  We both thought excellent!!!!
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Action packed movie with a great plot.  Makes you think what you would have done if you were in the same place.
1407130366|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was an excellent sci fi type of book.  At first the premise is kind of sick, but after awhile you get into it and the suspense and drama of the story take over.  I would recommend the books to anyone who wants to read something different for a change.  Well written and truly enjoyable read.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Watched this on a lark.  I was really impressed with the quality of the animation.  Take a look at the lifelike features of the characters
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so great on so many levels, it's visually stunning and I get lost in the characters the way you do with a really great book, every character is so well developed. The storyline is always interesting and engaging. Whatever series I choose next will almost certainly be disappointing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Clear, sharp graphics even in zoom mode.  Smooth play and challenging puzzles.  The hint system gave clues...just enough to get an idea on how to cure being stuck without giving the answer outright.  I really liked the alternate view using the eyepiece--very nice touch that added to the game immensely.  I wasn't sure where the storyline was going nor where it went but that didn't matter and didn't detract from the game either.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|It all about vanpires n werewolfs which we all love to watch :). The last fight could have been even more better. Will give it 4 because of the thrills
B009GX7IRA|5.0|i've seen every episode and the storyline flows perfectly. i'm never disappointed and im glad amazon has the episodes for download so i wont miss an episode, because im currently deployed in afghanistan. NCIS is the best show on tv hands down
B007N85POS|3.0|I thought I would like this because I saw the movie, but I wasn't very impressed by it. I didn't not have any success when I tried to buy the Mighty Eagle to go along with it.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This appealed to my style of organizing data compared to all the other apps I looked at.  There were times I would like to change the book title after I had time to think about it, but I didn't't know how.
B00B3GLRF2|4.0|This book had great pictures and ideas for Bento boxes. I gave it 4 stars because many of the instructions on how to make a shape was to use a cookie cutter. Also the recipes weren't detailed enough but I got the idea on most of them.
B009G41CG2|2.0|It's hard to change, I guess.  I found the style I used to play on my Dell laptop easy on the eyes and addicting.  I wish I could transfer the Mahjong Titans (fortress layout) to this site.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Lots of great actors in this one!<br />Hard to believe some of them are still acting in movies like this considering how old they are getting to be!<br />still, awesome movie!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Good game to waste some time with. The graphics are very nice. Would be easy for kids to play. But I'm lame and got it for myself. You do have to pay if you want to advance quickly.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|great story, very good acting. to me, they got it right. it was more art imitating life and less of what HollyWood thinks the public wants to see. I would highly recommend this to all movie viewers regardless of bias. I would challenge anyone to walk away unimpressed.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is the most horrible and BORING book I have ever read in my entire career of reading awesome books and possible if not defiantly in my entire life
B000000OQF|5.0|&#34;Appetite for Destruction&#34; CD by Guns N Roses is Great!<br /><br />All the Best Guns N Roses Songs are on This CD!  It arrived in Less than a Week, Brand New with Great Audio!<br /><br />Now I can Rock Out in my Car!  Long Live Rock & Roll!<br /><br />  A Very Satisfied Customer,<br />  Neva Lee
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This book was probably one of the best books I have ever read in my life of reading awesome books
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|I was blown away by this album from the first time I heard it.  The first day I had it, I played it four times in a row while at work.  It's chill, its chic, it's a throwback to Modern 80's.  I look forward to obtaining more works by Jessie Ware.  If you are a fan of chillout, electronica, trip hop and 80's synth pop - GET THIS NOW!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|great story would like more! If possible would enjoy romance or thriller books too  i would recommend everyone to read!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Take a trip through history with Henry Tudor and his wives. This captivating mini series that takes you on a journey of life of Henry Tudor.
B005HSL626|5.0|Its very challenging and its a lot of fun  its exciting, i would recommend this to every one young and old
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I didn't think I would like this being it was a parody.  I was surprised and enjoyed it.  Johnny Depp has done it again.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|i would like it if i could play it ,cause i think it would be very exciting i love a good challenge
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|These veteran actors will keep you laughing in this action pack movie.  It humor and action on the highest levels of the government. Who says you don't get better with age.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I lost a pet in march and this horse beauty helps me to maintain her and feed and love her
B0034JKZ86|4.0|Good movie.  Disney went back to classic animation.  I thought it should have been more detailed like Disneys past animations.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|very challenge i love it alot ,since my stroke it helps my brain work.Thank you very much!!!!like more if free
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is so wonderful you will need to watch it at least twice just to know how much is going on. The writing and the actors are first rate. I hope the series goes on for ever!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i enjoy face book very much,i meet my family and close friends and we talk,and play games together.<br />easy friendly
B00821PCJS|5.0|Goods science fiction. Sometimes episodes a bit plodding. Others fast paced. Takes its time to tell a story. You get wrapped up in the characters.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its awesome and its very challenging i would recommend this to young and old  and people who need help with a stroke.
B0083ZBW2Y|2.0|I know it's meant to be a classic, but I just couldn't get into it. I guess as it was free (or was it maybe 1 dollar) that it might be worth a try...
1400069742|2.0|I would advise anyone interested in having accurate information about FDR not to read this book. The author has carefully sought out and included any negative quote about FDR that she could find. Yes, there were many people who had negative things to say about FDR but there were ten times as many people she could have quoted who had only praise for FDR.<br /><br />I have read at least 30 books about FDR, some written by contemporaries who worked closely with him and others by historians who observed him at the time.  I have also read major portions of perhaps another 30 books about FDR.  Furthermore, I have read at least 100 books about that era, the 1930s and 1940s,  but I can hardly recognize the FDR Ms. Olson describes in her book.<br /><br />FDR understood better than any of his contemporaries when to pause and when to be aggressive -- he was a master of political timing. It is clear that this author has it in for FDR, either because she is pro-British or is a rightwinger.  It is important to bear in mind that while Churchill and FDR created a remarkable and unprecedented alliance during the war, FDR was against colonialism and Churchill was determined to hold onto the British Empire. That dispute was a constant source of agitation for both men in their historic partnership. Nevertheless, they managed to forge the alliance that merely saved Western civilization.<br /><br />Winston Churchill could not bear to watch as FDR's plane lifted off the ground, following the Casablanca Conference. Churchill turned to a friend and said of FDR: \\"If anything happened to that man, I couldn't stand it. He is the truest friend; he has the farthest vision; he is the greatest man I have ever known.\\"
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I find MacGyver humorous, suspenseful, imaginative and simply refreshing in this time of blood and gore that we see now.  This is a show my children watched and now I am introducing my grandchildren to the show.  Granted the size of phones and some of the floppy disks cause giggles but they become interested in how he will get out of a situation and the story line in particular.<br /><br />I do not know what RDA thought of this role but I hope he felt proud of it because I am happy that he mentions science and math as two things that can help you solve problems and that if you do not have to kill someone or shoot them you do not do it.  My grandchildren paid attention and it left room for discussion about present situations.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|I was not a huge fan of Twilight, I really disliked the concept and I thought the writing was terrible. Shiver makes Twilight seem like Shakespeare.<br /><br />The idea here is almost identical to Twilight; pretty girl becomes infatuated with a young man who happens to be a werewolf. She had loved him when he was a wolf, not knowing he was also a young man. He is equally obsessed with her. Her parents are oblivious to anything their daughter does, to the extent that she actually lives with said \\"wereboy\\" in her bedroom - for weeks. When she does tell them about Sam he inexplicably lives with the family. It goes downhill from there as far as storyline.<br /><br />The writing was just over the top, with our young man writing really bad song lyrics in his head. At one point he describes himself as a leaking womb and I was dumbfounded by that metaphor.  Overly descriptive writing that was often laughable. Characters that had great potential to bring some tension to the storyline are disposed of or never heard from again. And like the gorgeous Edward of the aforementioned Twilight we have constant commentary and descriptions of Sam's yellow eyes.<br /><br />Of course the biggest plot hole, which at first seemed clever, was the fact that when the weather turned cold is when our shape shifters turned into wolves. Once the weather turns warmer they shift back into humans, and are only able to remember vague parts of their lives as wolves; except for Sam who remembers Grace, mostly by her scent. The big question is, why live in Minnesota? I was thinking this as I was reading by the pool in Florida where it is never really cold! When you turn into a human - move, to any southern state or Hawaii maybe. Don't stay in Minnesota dreading the return of winter. It was just too hard to get over that gaping hole in logic.<br /><br />So read this if you want a fairly boring story about teenage love and angst. Better yet - dare I say it? - Read Twilight.
B0013TPVGK|3.0|Full disclosure: I have not finished this book yet. However, part of the reason for that is I keep encountering ideas that were written about before by authors such as Carlos Castenada and Richard Bach.  Just putting their ideas in the context of music isn't saying anything new. Even the way he relates to and describes &#34;Michael&#34; is reminiscent of Richard's relationship with Donald Shimoda in Illusions and of Carlos and Don Juan in his series of books.  If the reader is not familiar with either of these authors, then perhaps they will like this introduction to these ideas.  The siimilarities in concept and execution so far, for me, have just gotten in the way.  Perhaps I will change my mind as I continue to work through it.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Acting was great and the story line interesting. Very good. Need to write 10 more words to satisfy somebody in order to submit the 5 star rating so rambling for the sake of some ...
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The game to me gives me time to relax, even though my blood pressure goes up. It gives me a chance to get things complete. I told my friends about the game and they said they would try it out, if they did I cannot say.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|Even though this isn't a &#34;feel good&#34; movie, it was delightful to watch on a recent rainy afternoon. I had seen it several times before, so was surprised when I noticed things I had overlooked before.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this app a lot. but its addicting.  so if you like to play on your deviece then get this app.
B00APACSJG|4.0|I love all of the Vorkosigan saga- I wasn't to excited about the writing style or story at the beginning but warmed up to it. The end was great- I want more Miles and his universe!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game and it is also very addictive and lots<br />of people I know play it and they love it as well.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|My first review, so I may be all over the place, forgive me.  I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, so this was up my alley from the get go, then you ad Jeremy Irons into the mix and I'm engrossed. This is my type of soap opera! As always Mr. Irons is stellar ( and still soooo very good looking) and I'm now becoming a huge fan of Mr. Aurnad (sp?), who plays Cesare Borgia. I feel he plays the part well--I can see the rage inside of him as he struggles with his ambition, his father's ambition, which most of the time are in conflict, and his feelings for his sister.  The series visits situations based on history (with license) surrounding the Borgia Family. I give it five as an entertaining piece of historical fiction, there's violence, intrigue and forbidden romances, back stabbing upon back stabbing which, IMO, have all been portrayed with some class by all the actors.  Hope everyone who like historical fiction enjoys this as well and don't rely on it for historical fact, just enjoy!
B00BHU261S|4.0|Anthony Hopkins did a tremendous job of playing Alfred Hitchcock! Totally remarkable! The movie was fun in A tongue and cheek kind of way,  but reflected Hitchcock's enormous power of influence and suspense. This rendition of the shower scene shown this time from Hitchcock's point of view, was amazing! You're going to love this one!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|One of the best books I've read in the last several years. You will not be able to put it down.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is nice to be able to see and know how long you can still use a Kindle or similar electronic pads.  This helps you know exactly when you need to start charging the battery. Having that lnowledge means that you can continue to enjoy using without a main interruption.

B009OYSFDM|2.0|I will be very surprised if there's more than one season of this. It had potential, it had fun moments, I really wanted to like it, but overall it was a constant series of disappointments and wasted potential. Mostly bad writing.<br /> I eventually stopped watching telling myself I'd pick it up again later, but every time I looked at it it was so uninteresting that I finally cancelled my amazon subscription for it. I don't think I'll even finish watching the latest episodes I already paid for but haven't seen yet. That tells you how meh it was...

B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The controls are barely responsive, and that's generous.<br />Sure, its an interesting meme, it has some history, but this<br />game really didn't do it any favors. You wander randomly,<br />trying to find papers, and at some point this creepy guy appears, and you die.<br />Yeah, glad I got it free, and more glad its not taking up space on my Kindle anymore.

B008XG1X18|4.0|Not alot to say, its an app, by Pinterest, for Pinterest.<br />It seems to work just fine on my Kindle, since I seem to be able to waste<br />a ton of time floating around on Pinterest with it. That's all it needs to do,<br />and it does.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I can't remember the last time I recommended a book to so many people. This should be a must read for all Americans, because it pulls back the curtain on how processed food got to be where it is today. Remarkably it's a very entertaining read, with the pacing feeling almost like a detective novel. But most impressively, it is not a polemic - it's a rational analysis of how the food mega-companies raced to add more sugar, more salt, and more fat to their foods in the quest for profits. They do it because we buy it. It was rather astounding to find out that not only to the majority of the executives in these companies hate their own products, but they openly admit they can't cut back on these ingredients if they tried, because they would lose market share.<br /><br />This book is full of wild statistics and crazy facts that will blow your mind - such as how many pounds of sugar we eat a year, how many pounds of cheese are snuck into our foods that we don't even notice, how the average salt intake is far higher than is recommended... the list goes on and on. I've had a Kindle for years now and this is the first book I ever made highlights in, because there are so many passages that just deserve to be re-read and shared with others.<br /><br />Get this book! You'll never look at processed food the same way again, even if you already think you're eating healthy.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The app is easy to use, type in your topic and it comes up with all of the video's under that topic.  Choose the one you want to view/download and it gives you the option to VIEW or DOWNLOAD and in various quality levels. Downloads are quick. Good App!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is the first of John green's books I read, and I confess I am not going to be satisfied until I finish them all.  Reminiscent of  J. D. Salinger and Robert Cormier characters who tackled the tough questions with the humor and arrogance of youth captured in a teen's mind and heart .
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A spy thriller based on the WWII trick army assigned to george patton.  Predictable but fast moving fun.  It is worth a look.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great quality program!  My girlfriend and I highly enjoy.  We would recommend this series to anyone and we liked the HD version.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|After an update or two its even better.<br />I got it as a FAoTD, and it works well for what I want.<br />I wouldn't try to do anything too high power or responsive required,<br />but for checking out my PC, security, etc. its good.
B002R88G4U|4.0|This book informed me about the occupation of which I knew nothing. I loved the way the characters developed and whereas some people thought the romance element detracted from the story I disagree in fact made the characters more likeable.<br /><br />This book is written in letter format which took me a while to get used to.<br /><br />Due to the odd letter breaks I would not advise reading this in ebook format
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Love the show and I am not one to watch network TV - at all.<br /><br />However, EVERY time they have a chance to denigrate Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, Churchgoers etc, they take it.  Also, every chance they have to present the left viewpoint as reasonable, the current administration as reasonable and the other side NOT, they do.<br /><br />To most people, (they are so used to this) it would not even register, but to me, it makes me cringe.  So while I am into the show, enjoying the story, learning about the characters etc, having a good time, and then BAM - like someone took a baseball bat and knocked you on your head - you pause and say how dumb is that.  This country is still pretty much 50/50 so why denigrate half the viewers?<br /><br />Keep the politics out, please.  This is supposedly entertainment, not indoctrination.  Otherwise, good job.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|Clever, but sometimes resorting to easy cheap (political) shots, it's a funny movie, with special effects that are wondrous by crowd-sourcing standards.  It could have been better, but the producers have shown a gift for low-budget productions, and I look forward with great anticipation to their future efforts.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Bradley Cooper did an amazing job of portraying a person with bi-polar disorder. If you have every had anyone in your life with this disorder you will recognize his character, including the frustration, the rage, the grief, the obsession, the remorse, and the love of everyone around him trying to reason with and help him. Frankly, crazy people drive me crazy, but this is a story of love, humor and hope. Everyone raves about the performance of Jennifer Lawrence, and well they should, but this movie is a showcase of spectacular performances by everyone involved. It's a must-see.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|i was intherested in this story...but tom hardy is worth watching it for<br />even if you dont like the genre
B007BFSYMS|1.0|I uninstalled this ages ago, it was really not worth the space.<br />So it makes some random white noises that you can select from.<br />They're fairly poor quality really, and then there's no way to turn the damn thing<br />off! It just kept wanting to play in the background, over and over.<br />Got rid of it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I feel like I want to tell people to calm down and relax. This not the worst book ever. There is some pretty back shlock out there. I agree with people who say that the book felt rushed, it did. I agree with people who are annoyed with the ending. I know how most people want this to end, and I'm sorry Harris as said many many times that she wasn't going to turn Sookie. So sorry, but you were warned. The ending is just sort of lame. If she had had another book, before this one, the ending would be less lame and less...shocking I guess to people. At the end of the day kids, this is book about Vampires, Fairies, Shapeshifters etc. How \\"real\\" can it be. It's not War & Peace. But it was never meant to be. Let it go.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I guess I'm one of the fans not happy with the ending. Eric forever!<br /><br />I've been reading Charlaine since the beginning and have a few signed first edition Aurora Teegarden books.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll continue reading and loving her books in the future even though I'm not thrilled with how she chose to end this series.<br /><br />Thanks for the ride Charlaine!

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What else can you say.  So many of these series get tedious - think Terry G, SM Stirling, Modesti.  This ending ties up all the loose ends, answers questions, moves well and is as satisfying as one could hope.  A fitting end to an era.
B008133MDK|5.0|I've loved the Sherlock Holmes stories since first reading them as a young girl (some time ago).<br /><br />Enjoyed all of the incarnations over the years (Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, RDJ).<br /><br />This is hands down my favorite. The writing is intelligent and complex; the actors are perfectly cast and incredibly talented.  The bromance between Holmes and Watson is brilliantly played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman and it is what gives this series its humor, pathos, and humanity.<br /><br />American television might take a lesson from Sherlock, which is sexy and suspenseful without graphic sex or violence.<br /><br />Season 3 can't come soon enough.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Don't waste your time with this piece of junk. The acting is good, but the story is boring and slow and terrible. Just dumb.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  I can't wait until January for Season 4 to start.  Too long of a wait. Very good acting.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|When I was a teen, I loved Kurt Vonnegut. I introduced several of my friends to his witty satire and collected all of his early works. &#34;Cat's Cradle&#34; was one of my favorites. However, as I grew older, I also found myself growing away from Mr. Vonnegut. After &#34;Slaughterhouse Five&#34; (his best book, I believe) I found myself borrowing, rather than buying his books, and eventually not even that. At some point during 30+ years of marriage and several moves, my Vonnegut collection was donated to charity.<br /><br />I've bought the Kindle editions of those two books and his short story collection, &#34;Welcome to the Monkey House,&#34; to see if he still had that old magic for me. Sadly, he hasn't. The story of &#34;Cat's Cradle&#34; just doesn't resonate with me, whether I'm considering it as science fiction or the tale of a disfunctional family or of corporate irresponsibility. Even the sex fails to titillate. If nothing else, it's a young man's story, and somewhere along the way, I've gotten old, and I've seen too many apocalypses along the way. I'm not sorry I reread it, but I don't have to do it again.<br /><br />Or, to quote the author, &#34;No damned cat, no damned cradle.&#34;
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|Very imaginative. Heard about this from &#34;word of mouth&#34;:. Sure glad I did. There is a LOT of subtle comedy here!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The movie has a very good plot and interesting character stories; quite engaging, but is full of unnecessary nudity and rough language.
B007SXB498|4.0|Much has been written about Jane Austen, who is deservedly revered as an exemplary and ground breaking writer with extraordinary gifts of observation and gentle satire. I do like &#34;Emma&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; better.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It was a little surprising that we were left with a cliff hanger here so I hope they plan on making more movies to complete the Hobbit.  I enjoyed the movie and have watched it several times.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Schindler's List is without a doubt an exceptional masterpiece. But more than that it is a very realistic, powerful, and dramatic rendering of the most significant event in the history or mankind. Telling the story of German Industrialist Oskar Schindler as the main subject of the story makes the film a monument to this man and his incredible story. Schindler was just an ordinary German who exploited the war for his own gain. He raised an empire with money that wasn't his, and prospered to make \\"More money than anyone could spend in a lifetime\\". Over time he see's the horror and cruelty that is inflicted on the Jews and realizes that what he has prospered from is stained with the blood of millions of people. He transforms into a man who fights to save them. He spends every cent he has earned to buy the Jews from Nazi concentration camps to work in his factory making artilary shells that can't even be fired. This incredible true story is grim, freightening, extremely violent, brutal and heartbreaking. It is also an incredible story of a touching transformation of one man who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews. Schindler's list is one of the most powerful films you are likely to ever see and the winner of 7 Oscars, including best Picture (1993). It is filled with horrifying images of brutality, Sex, graphic nudity, and harsh language, so be aware of this where small children or sensitive types are concerned. For all others this film should be considered required viewing. Simply as powerful as motion pictures can ever get.
1250012570|5.0|I had seen so many people loving this book. So I just had to buy it. But once I got it, I wasn't sure if I would read it, because like I always do, I had to peek at the ending. And I was not all that pleased with what I found. And yet I could not let this book out of my head. Because it sounded so amazing and sweet and cute. Then today I just needed to read it. Cause I've been sick for a while, and I really wanted a cute book to read. This was perfect.<br /><br />I loved this book from the very beginning. I loved the writing, the story, the characters. There is just so many words in this book. I won't be quoting any of the quotes, but I loved almost every sentence in this book. This book is told from the point of view of Eleanor and Park. Both are amazing characters. I don't know who I liked the most. They are both weird and cute and all kinds of amazing. I just loved both of them to pieces. Sniffs.<br /><br />I don't know how to talk about my love for this book. But I will try. Because I feel that I have a lot of words inside me about this book and these characters and that ending. Such an evil ending. Yet with hope. I think. Will need to discuss it some, at the end of my review, with spoilers, but will post a warning then :) First I need to talk about the amazing plot and perfectly broken characters.<br /><br />There are two main characters in this book. First there is Eleanor. Whom I loved so much. She's just amazing. I was a bit unsure about her in the beginning, since she did seem a bit weird. But I understood her. And I grew to love her so much. Eleanor is an amazing girl. She's fat, and has wild red hair. She wears weird man clothes. Yet she is one of the most amazing characters I have read about. She's fun and sweet and loving. I loved her hair. I loved her size. I'm not sure I loved her clothes, though ;p<br /><br />I loved reading from her point of view. Although it was a bit depressing. Because she does not have a good life. At all. And it made me so sad. Yet it was perfect, and I loved every moment of it. She lives with her mom and four younger siblings. I kind of liked the younger kids. Maybe. We didn't get to know them enough, to be honest. And they were a tiny bit annoying. But they were also a bit adorable, and I felt sorry for them a lot. Unsure about her mom. I might have liked her a bit. But also kind of hated her.<br /><br />See, she has this husband. And he is an a**. Truly. And yet I didn't think he was as bad as some other stories I have read.. And yet, he was awful. I hated him. They all hated him. And yet she was with him. Grrr. But I also kind of loved it, because it made the story pretty interesting, which I loved so much. We learn so much about Eleanor and her family life. How poor they are. Where her real dad is. Who I kind of really hated as well. Sigh. I hated her life. Yet I loved her for it, which makes sense to me.<br /><br />Then there is Park, who I loved so much. I'm pretty sure I loved him a tiny bit more than Eleanor. Maybe. He was just so amazing. Half Korean and he's a total badass. lol. Not really, but he does take taekwondo with his dad and younger brother. I just loved him so much. He's kind and sweet and all kinds of awesome. He lives with his family, with his grandparents next door as well. He has a good life. And I loved that. And even though he has a good life, he's still an amazing unique character. Adored him so.<br /><br />I won't say more about the characters than that. Just, sigh. They are all amazing. And I fell in love with Eleanor and Park so hard. This book is about their love story, set in 1986. And oh. It is a sweet love story. But it also has some heartbreak. Sobs. But not too much high school drama, which I loved. I did love the school scenes, though, with Tina and everyone else. I loved Eleanor's two girl friends at school. They were kind of adorable. And Park's best friend, I loved him too. Well, for the most part, I think.<br /><br />There is a lot of things happening in this book. There is the romance, which is a huge part of the book, but not all of it. There is heartbreak. And some pretty sad scenes. Yet there are so many happy moments that made me smile. I just loved this book so much. I loved reading about Eleanor and Park. They were just adorable together. I just wish this book had been longer. I truly wish that. Sigh. I never wanted it to end. I wanted them to be alone and happy together more. I wanted that with all my heart.<br /><br />Anyway. Eleanor & Park is such an amazing book. And you all need to read it. So if you own it, go read it right away. If you don't own it, go buy it. And you need to read it as soon as possible. Because it really is amazing, and I'm sure you will all love it. Just, please, let there be a sequel to this book. I need one. And also.. Please let it be a sequel that happens right where the book ends, or just a few months later. I still want it to be a young adult book, with the same characters :) I'm just really glad I read this book.<br /><br />And now for some spoilery thoughts about the ending of this book. This is your warning. Don't want to know? Don't read more. I did like the ending. Sort of. But only the last word, to be honest. Because, there is one thing that I can't stand, and that is long seperations. And this was a whole year. Where Eleanor did nothing. And it broke my heart so much. I need to know what will happen next. What happened to her family? We never learned. I need to know. Sigh. I just need a sequel, or epilogue. &lt;3ning in this book. There is the romance, which is a huge part of the book, but not all of it. There is heartbreak. And some pretty sad scenes. Yet there are so many happy moments that made me smile.

B00881PTRC|4.0|What is very good about this game is that there are different categories from which to choose your word.  For such short words, mostly shorter than 7, this game is fairly difficult.  The art work (hangman) is much more detailed than the stick figures.  In most cases children would probably need some help.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I enjoyed parts of this movie, but thought it was poorly written<br />and the jokes were flat.  Streisand plays the yiddish mama<br />pretty well but combining the kvetching with trying to be<br />sexy turned me off.
B000URWYTS|5.0|A great love story combined with architectural genius,  feminism before its time and a shocking ending  make it a great read!
B004XZR63M|5.0|If you are looking for a how to book this book isn't the one for you. It is a book about thinking and how you need to think if you ever want to be rich. It tells you to invest in your financial education. It's a very uplifting book if you ask me.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Finally I have seen this film after all these years just a few minutes ago for the first time. I cannot express how much this movie touched my inner being. And by the end I felt a powerful emotion I had not felt in a long time. I felt a deep passionate feeling of longing and hope once again after nearly 12 years. My heart had been broken so many times that I felt I could never love again, or feel it again. But after viewing The Bridges of Madison County I was so moved that I cried for more than 15 minutes through the end of the film and afterward. I felt those feelings of longing, hope, and pain once again- and it hurt deeply, but it also made me feel alive again. This story is so moving and beautiful it is impossible to describe in a short review. But putting it plainly, this story is about a chance encounter between two people who find a love so powerful that even the union of marriage and prior commitments cannot snuff it out. It is a love that happens only once in a lifetime. The kind of love that is so rare and beautiful that few will ever experience it. Clint Eastwood has created a breathtaking masterpiece in this film, and this story is so moving that it truly is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Both Eastwood and Streep were absolutely brilliant. This film is a must see for anyone who has suffered a broken heart, has dreamed of true love, or has lost all hope. Love can come when you least expect it, And this film is a timeless classic that will take your breath away if you let it draw you in and if you are willing to leave you prudeness at the door it will be a film you will never forget. A glorious celebration of hope and love.

B00181MHQU|3.0|As everyone knows, West Side Story is an incredible movie, but the quality of this version leaves much to be desired.  It was grainy in spots and pixellated in other spots.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Randall Walllace directs a very different view of the vietnam war. This vision of war is one of the most realistic and chilling ever put on screen. We Were Soldiers depicts war in a very unflattering and extremely ugly way. There is also a realism to the entire story and battle footage that is hard to ignore. We Were Soldiers has an \\"in your face\\" realism that somehow cannot be matched by other films about war. There is more we see here as to how the families of these men are handling the days and nights never knowing when or if their men will return home. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the film as our soldiers and their families hear the news that they will be going to Vietnam in just days, and how they react to the realities of it. The commanding officer played by Mel Gibson gives a final speech to his platoon as family members sit nearby in the grandstand. It's a moment that seems extremely realistic script wise, and well detailed in a simple yet realistic manner. Just following is one of my favorite moments in the film, as Gibson's character kisses his wife goodbye, then heads out late in the night with rifle and dufflebag and ends up standing alone in an empty field as the music builds a dramatic and unsettling tone. Then out of the shadows more men arrive, then hundreds, then dozens of buses. It's a powerful moment that forces the audience to feel the unsettling nervous atmosphere as well. It is like the film is saying \\"Well audience, your not just going to watch a movie, your gonna get on this bus and you are going to Vietnam\\". What is to follow is some of the most realistic, harrowing, and brutal war footage ever filmed and it is astonishing! There is no other war film like We Were Soldiers. It's not there to try to be cinematic or blockbusting. It's there to be as unflattering and brutally honest as possible, and I for one think Randall Wallace and crew deffinately got the the message across with no problem...\\"War is truly hell.\\"

B000MR1V22|2.0|I am not sure what to think of this film. I knew little about it before I saw it for the first time last night. I expected this total feel good experience where everyone's dreams come true. Instead the film tells a story that is as opposite as it get's. I wouldn't call it a basic comedy because it really is more of a drama than a comedy. Through the entire film everything that could possibly go wrong for the characters does. The film deals with attempted suicide, death, heroin addiction, hopes and dreams nearly or completely destroyed, positive thinking rendering a less than desirable result, frustration, and basically what ends up being a movie filled with depressing subject matter. I enjoyed the film for what it was, but at the same time I was left wondering what the point was. Was it attempting to send the message that nothing goes right no matter how bad you believe it will go right? Was it saying \\"Hey, this is life. Yea it sucks, but here's a story about just how bad it can suck and the people involved can appreciate how much it sucks\\"? As a whole the film deals with a family hoping for the best and getting the worst, and that alone makes me wonder what the point was in making this movie. So the message is loud and clear. \\"Life sucks, but we still have each other\\". Didn't like this one much in all honesty

B003IEJZUG|5.0|I had been putting off this book for quite a while, as I mostly read science fiction / fantasy.  It was highly recommended to me though, so I purchased it when it was on sale.  I read through it in just one to two sittings, and really enjoyed it!  This is one of those books I thought about a lot when it was done, which I always think is a good thing with books.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It's a good game but it would freeze and lag. Also the guns are WAY over priced (glu guns). The graphics are good but you need to fix the guys helmet it don't match with the rest of the body or game.Also I think there should be a skill tree included for example one part should be a medic part which increases health an rate of Fire. The second on should be called tank with increases defense a bit increases reload speed and damage. The last one should be commando which increase head shot damage and and aim. It also increases health.
B0057ZAA0S|2.0|I am one of a small handful of people that pretty much disliked this movie. I gave it 2 stars because it has some uniquely creative aspects to it, but I do not care for the basic style it was made in. The film flaunts it's comic book style absurdity. I would have really enjoyed this film if was told in a serious and realistic manner similar to that of other drug films like Christiane F., which in my opinion is probably the best film about heroin addicts ever made. But generally speaking I really don't care for films that take the serious issues and make them into fantasies. You know- the mannerisms of the story and filming technique that are there to get noticed for their flashy artistry. This is the same reason I hated 'Requiem for a dream'. The film had such a powerful story to tell, so why muck it up with a bunch of silly artistic flashiness? For me this style of film making rarely works. Even Oliver Stone managed to annoy me with some of 'Natural Born Killers', which I did like very much. And I love his films for the most part. Stone did well with artistic imagery in that film and 'The Doors', which I loved. But there is a wackiness to the style of film making here that is similar to a few of Terry Gilliam's movies that I really don't like much. I didn't care for really any of his films either primarily due to this \\"fantasy\\" style of film making that is used in films with primarily serious subject matter. So far I have absolutely hated nearly every movie Danny Boyle has made except for 127 hours. I much prefer films that have a flair of psychedelia that were made in the 60's or 70's if they are going to be that way. Boyle's style annoys the crap out of me. it's the very thing that ruined Slumdog Millionaire for me. It remains the worst best picture Oscar winner I have ever seen. Trainspotting and films with a similar style nowadays just seem laughable, and they usually give me a first class headache in the process.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|If there was one thing I could say about this book is it would be &#34;read it.&#34; Makes a lot of sense, especially in the field of Real Estate, where you wear many hats and can be easily distracted.
B006P0FIB0|3.0|the flick is pretty good good 3d in and out good addition to your 3d collection I bought it and enjoyed it
0920236162|5.0|Another great Robert Munsch book! It truly is about how people are on the inside not outward appearances. I nice variation on princess books.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I think this second book in the series continues nicely from the first.  The setting is still depressing, in a futuristic fantasy way, which helps the reader care for the well-being of the main characters even more in my opinion.  The romance side of the story was a little lacking from what it was built up to be.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The most impressive thing about this movie is the visuals. Yes, there's tons of CGI, but that's beyond the point. It's a visual feast. The story is original and wonderful. It leaves you with some questions that you may resolve by yourself.
B002BI6SMI|3.0|Taken is the sort of film where you pretty much need to leave your common sense at the door and just have a good time. Yes it's about as predictable as it get's, and there are some issues that make it rather silly. Liam Neeson is a superb actor but as dumb as it sounds this role would be better suited for someone like Kiefer Sutherland. Basically the character Neeson plays is Jack Bauer with a different face. But a more important issue is how silly the whole story is. Neeson's character is a highly trained ex-government agent who has a daughter who wants to travel to Europe following U2's tour dates as they travel. Neesun's character knows the world all too well and is concerned for her safety. He tries to talk her out of it knowing how dangerous it is to travel to another country. To make a long story short- He gives in an let's her go. Well she arrives, and in less than a few hours She get's kidnapped by criminals who want to sell her on the black market as a sex slave. Like the audience is actually supposed to swallow such nonsense? Naturally he must go and rescue his daughter on his own, and he expertly kills at least 50 people on his journey until he finally finds her. He's (of course) left almost unwounded through the entire affair. The good news is that the film is filled with some excellent and well crafted action sequences that make it worth seeing. But if you are a 24 fan it's nothing you haven't seen a hundred times. Basically the film is a brainless action movie, but it is a great deal of fun to watch anyway.
B0033AX20E|4.0|This is the first album from my favorite band.  This is the remastered version, which helps it sound better.  Obviously early stuff, not as good, IMO, as Inhuman Rampage, but still excellent songs.  Very energizing music!
B004SKIPXW|4.0|I like it good 3d in and out would recommend this for the 30 somethings good if ya want to see naked chicks in 3d
193700788X|1.0|This book felt like a slap in the fact to fans. It feels as if the author is punishing those who also liked the TV series. I hope that the TV series, which is much better written, does not have to follow the same ending. I do not believe for one minute that this is what the author had planned from the beginning.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I was a fan of the first two books, and was excited to finish the series.  Though much of the first part was decent in my opinion - not great, but had potential to turn around - the ending left me with nothing but blank confusion.  I can't think of another book, particularly the last book in an otherwise good series, that I liked less than this one.<br /><br />Though I think it would be hard to not read the third book, my recommendation is to finish after the second and make up your own ending in your head!  This book will likely just disappoint.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Fun to play, a good waste of time.  A little annoying that some things are only aquirable with gems.  gems are only gotte through purchase or slowly through leveling.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|It's the kind of story that is as much for the men as it is for the ladies. Probably every guy out there has met a girl something like Holly before. She's beautiful, free spirited, unique, and also mysteriously quirky. She's the kind of girl that seems impossible to understand. In fact I have met girls just like her. The character George Peppard plays has more patience with a girl like Holly than most men today seem to have. I admired this character a great deal. Every young girl wants a sensitive, caring, handsome, gentle, and accepting male friend they can play cuddles with without any serious commitments. Someone to be there and to listen. And best of all there are no strings attached and he's always there when you need him. Holly is the kind of girl that can drive a man crazy with confusion and bewilderment. But she is representative of many young females. Men like our leading man here are few and far between. Most would have given up long before he does. he is genuinely more concerned about the well being of others than for him self. In today's world men like him are thought of by some as pushovers. But he in fact is a rare breed of a man that seriously earns the respect of his peers. Now Holly Golightly does seem a little crazy, but She's a hell of a lot of fun to hang around even if her life is a bit of a mess. In short I fell in love with this movie and with it's main characters.
B005EI86JU|5.0|If you have a Nikon D7000 it's a good book.<br />If you have need to understand the basics of photography it's a good book.<br />If you have both of them it's a great book!
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|great for adults and kids good use of 3d in and out great humor good for your 2d collection funny
B0081L391C|1.0|I recorded this from one of the pay channels I subscribe to and I'm glad to say I never spent a dime in a theater or rental store for this rotten movie.  While there were several laughs, the acting was poor and the story-line a complete and utter failure.  I just don't get hollywood anymore.  They continually put out crap movie after crap movie such as this.  This movie had four stars in the pay channel preview guide, so I thought I was in for something special. Boy, was I disappointed.  No need to say more.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Going in to the last book, I felt that there were dozens of story lines that needed endings, and was apprehensive that they would all be done in one book.<br /><br />While I found some of these endings to be a little rushed or disappointing, overall I was very pleased, and often surprised, by who things wrapped up.<br /><br />This book is clearly a must-read for anyone that's already read the first 13, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|This movie had me laughing outloud all by myself all throughiut the movie. I would recommend it to everyone. I love Natalie.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|Clint Eastwood scores big once again with what I consider one of his two best films in the directors chair. The other being 'Million dollar baby'. But this is the first film Eastwood has directed that I feel a word like \\"Masterpiece\\" is honestly fitting. The Changeling is brilliant from start to finish. Every actor perfectly cast, sets, costumes, period detail, script, and everything else in between here are top notch. Eastwood and crew managed to bring 30's Los Angeles back to life in extremely accurate ways and it helps deliver a solid and believable story. This film is rich with incredible authenticity and way above average acting. This is compelling story telling at it's very best. With the help of Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Clint Eastwood has created a solid, powerful, richly glorious masterpiece. Consider the facts here folks. (A)it's A story that is so interesting that it is a wonder no director took it on long ago. (B) It's a shocking and controversial story (C) It's all about one determined woman who must fight police corruption, politicians, and even the state mental health system, and all she wants is to get her son who has dissapeared back. It's horrifying enough if you have a missing child. But imagine what it would be like if the police and all other governmental authorities didn't believe you. Then once they did believe you they tried to cover up their own mistakes, then send you to the funny farm for embarrassing them. Well that is what happens in 'The Changeling', and most fascinating of all is that the entire story is true. This rates as one of the best films I have seen in a long, long time.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Everything works perfectly as it should be.<br />I really like to laid down on my bed and operate my new PC from there with my tablet.

B001OSIV62|3.0|Slow but historical.  Very interesting.  but you have to be in the right mood for the type of film.  some light partial nudity.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is another young adult novel that I read as an adult.  It was very easy to read as the writing was pretty simplistic, but the story was interesting enough to keep me from putting it down.  I often re-read books, and don't know if this will make it to that re-read list anytime soon, but I do think fans of the young adult fantasy novels will enjoy this.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game.  Fast action. Fast paced game that keeps you moving.  Because of this game, I also tried Temple Run 2 and like that game even better!
B001AITH50|4.0|I remember some time ago, before the actual release of this first film adapted from an Anne Rice novel, upon hearing the news that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt would play the two lead roles, Rice was very upset and didn't invision anyone even close to either actor playing these characters she had penned. After she saw the film, to say the least, she was very pleased. Neil Jordan and crew created an incredible rendering of the Novel. Interview with the Vampire manages to capture and ignite the screen with nearly the same passion as the novel had. Cruise and Pitt proved to be not only good in the roles, but sort of reinvented their characters while still giving the audience what it had hoped for, a rendering true to the novel. Some who have seen the film were not pleased with Antonio Banderas being cast as Armand. This is obviously because the Armand of the book is visualized as looking very different. But as it turns out Banderas delivers probably the best performance in the entire film. His portrait of Armand is absolutely brilliant. Also his custumes and makeup made him truly freightening and believable. After I saw the film the first time I remember remarking to my fellow film goers that the film was \\"The Gone With the Wind of vampire movies\\". After seeing this movie the other day for the fourth of fifth time I think that statement might be very well true the more I think about it even if it seemed silly at the time. Every aspect of the film is top notch. Sets, Costumes, acting, script, direction, and the interpretation of the book were all excellent. So far this film ranks as one of the very best horror films ever made.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I am an actual descendant of Eric The Red, and his viking family. With that being said, this was very interesting to me, and therefore mg opinion may be biased.<br /><br />Many people dislike the sexual nature of the show, or the animal sacrifices; but that was how it was handled back then. To me, and my limited knowledge of that history, the show is a historically accurate portrayal of Viking history- with great cinematography. Well done, history channel.
B00701897I|4.0|it's got a little bit of everything great story good 3d depth and some pop this is a movie for adults good for your 3d collection
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Special effects were good, movie storyline lacking.  Book was fine, but movie missed the mark at capturing the book's ending.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|The beginning of this book clearly ends one part of the story, and then starts another.  I didn't enjoy this one as much as the previous three, but fans of the first three should definitely still pick this one up, and will likely enjoy at least parts, if not all, of this one as well.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is a must try for anyone that likes runner style games and likes comics. It gives comic fans or just Iron Man fans a great way to enjoy this style of game .
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|The first hour of this movie is truly remarkable. Thanks primarily to R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D Onofrio who turn in unforgettable performances. Both of these actors were amazing. But Ermey steals this film completely as drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The fact he didn't win an Oscar for this incredible performance is one of the most unfortunate mistakes the members of the academy have probably ever made. His performance as a tough and heartless drill instructor is one of the most realistic and powerful performances ever put on film. The realism of life in a tough training facility for future marines is about as true to life as any film has ever been able to get. However, the second hour of this movie while very good, doesn't measure up to its prior hour. As we move forward in the story and the recruits from the boot camp are shipped into Vietnam, the realism takes a few steps down. Part of the problem is the locations Kubrick chose For filming. Kubrick actually filmed portions of the war segments (if I remember correctly) at Pinewood studios in England. So this seems to effect the realism of the film based on the locations chosen for shooting these sequences. The battle sequences are meant to be indirect, or a matter of inconvenience for the troops, who are simply on their way to finish another objective. So they are never thrust into any kind of massive direct battle, but instead are forced into being pinned down by snipers. The actual battle sequences are extremely good, but not as dramatic, not as cinematic, and not as realistic as those of films like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, We were soldiers, and several other films I can think of. Still the result pretty dramatic and very well done. But its the first hour of this film that you will remember more than the rest of it. But all in all this film is a solid movie that is hard to forget.
1439127700|4.0|An excellent book, which I and still reading.  I will add it to my library when I finish reading it.

B001QJUX24|5.0|Excellent acting.  John Ford did a great job of directing.<br />I am familiar with the Palo Duro canyon country of west Texas and the location was superb.<br />The only area I might have emphasized would be the truth rather than fiction and included more of the part that the real Cynthia Parker played in the story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan.  His books are always a good read and always touch the heart.  I have truly enjoyed every one of his books.  Keep writing Nicholas.
B000T46O52|5.0|Make no mistake, Philadelphia is not an easy film to sit through. In many ways it is a painful experience to watch. But it is also one of the most touching and beautiful films ever made. Few can sit through it without shedding at least a few tears. But more importantly, few can sit through it without experiencing enlightenment and inner change. This makes Philadelphia an incredibly important film that everyone should see at least once. It has the power to touch even the most bigoted anti-homosexual souls in this world. The film is also a meticulous masterpiece, and few can argue the claim. The acting by every single person in this film is impeccable. Central characters as well as those playing smaller roles bring honest realism, as well as truth and humanity to their characters. Jonathan Demme honestly and tenderly tells the story of one human being stricken with aids, and the suffering it inflicts, and the way it effects family and friends. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington deliver powerful and unforgettable performances that are not only good, but are truly astonishing in every possible aspect. Philadelphia is no ordinary movie. It is a life affirming film that has the power to change the way the world see's, accepts and understands those stricken with the AIDS virus. It is a glorious memorial to all those who have suffered and died of AIDS, and to those who still live who are facing it as you read this review. If I had my way I would see to it that this film were required viewing in our nation's high school class rooms. It is an unforgettable, powerful, and important film that should not be missed. Though a little bit dated, it is one of the few films out there that can truly be called important and vital. I have seen this film several times, and each time I see it it changes me and opens my eye's just a little more. Truly an incredible film. My highest recommendation. This film will touch you like few movies can.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Action packed read, very entertaining. The book is full of unexpected turns and unexpected surprises.  An easy read, very enjoyable.

B001RI3DZI|2.0|After directing Pacino in the dreadful 88 minutes recently, director John Avnet receives divine forgiveness for delivering a better than average Righteous Kill. Working again with Pacino and with the special added bonus teaming Pacino and De Niro again for the first time since Michael Mann's 1992 crime thriller, Heat. The two play disenchanted, seasoned police detectives who are all too familiar with the fact that violent criminals they worked so hard to nail are allowed to go free. Both men are enraged by this. The character De Niro plays allows his brute anger to show outwardly, while Pacino's character(Rooster) Keeps the same feelings inside and calmly deals with it as best he can. Then things come to a head when a child killer is also allowed to go free because of a legal technicality, the two men frame the \\"Mutt\\" for a crime he didn't commit. During this \\"crossing the line\\" choice they make the two are assigned to investigate a series of vigilante murders, the targets whom are some of these scum bags that were allowed to go free. Upon seeing the first victim of the killer at the crime scene, Rooster can't help but comment concerning the killer, \\"They should give the guy a medal\\". Their investigations lead them to discover that the person responsible for the killings may be a cop. But this doesn't matter to the audience because from the very begining, the movie tells us who the killer is. None the less despite that there is a surprise ending that will knock your socks off. This film is well made and hardly resembles the very bad 88 minutes John Avnet directed just before this one. This film is not a great picture but it is a pretty damned good one. One side note though. I did feel that John Leguizamo, a very good actor who has had much bigger parts was under-used in this film. All in all Pacino, De Niro, Leguizamo, Dennehy, and Wahlberg were all great. And this film is good enough to be considered a very good but not righteous movie.
B008Y73940|4.0|As an attorney who works out of his Lincoln, McConaughey brings a touch of comic relief to an otherwise serious profession. His character is not afraid to tread where others fear to go, defending people who would probably be shunned by other, more &#34;affluent&#34; lawyers. He finds his way into and out of troubles, keeping your attention all the while.<br />A fun watch for a movie not intended to be a comedy!
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|We like everything about this movie including the light shining through Normans ears good 3d not a whole lotta pop but good for the collection

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Take it from someone who has read the three-book series: This movie is a great introduction to an exciting story line! Through out the story line is woven thread after thread of conflict on so many levels, yet captures your attention so that none of those conflicts are lost or left behind.<br />I can't wait to see how the balance of the story is produced ... If this movie is any indication, it should be thrilling to watch!<br />I recommend the books as well as the movie series!

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I was surprised that my 5 year old liked it as much as she did. It's not like she remembers 8-bit games or has really played many video games at all. But I guess this speaks to how well Disney does their films.  I like a film where I can root for underdogs and unexpected protagonists.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Lead actress plays several different clones. Her characters are so distinct and well developed that you'll quickly forget that they aren't different cast members.  It is stunning what she can do! The story lines are intelligent and captivating, a great antidote to mindless adventure stories.

B00AMSLRAC|5.0|I like a game for my two girls that doesn't focus on beauty, hair products or being overly cute.  I think it's great that this game teaches a kid about how to grow plants and where food comes from, even though it's very simply portrayed.  My 5 and 3 year old really like playing it, the game is very intuitive and it keeps them occupied for 20 minutes or more.  So far, with about 50 games or apps downloaded for free, this is the ONLY one I have purchased and I'm completely happy with it.

193700788X|2.0|This review contains spoilers. Be warned.<br />I want to start this review off by saying I have the utmost respect for Ms. Harris. I've loved these books since my teenage years, and I've been emotionally invested in Sookie for half my life. That being said, the last book left me completely heartbroken. It felt as if it were fanfiction, and the characters were flat and acted, well, out of character.<br /><br />Eric's actions left me completely confused and heartbroken. We all knew he was a selfish, possessive Viking -  but his redeeming quality was that he loved Sookie and would change deep-seated and damaging parts of himself that he long clung to because his love for her made him break all his own rules and see the world with new perspective. In the end, however, he threw all that away by his choices, and I never imagined that he would behave like that, with or without Sookie. That was the biggest wrong I felt in the book.<br /><br />Sookie, also, acted lost and like her light had gone out, settling on something convenient and getting over her earth-shattering relationship with Eric with ease. I always wanted Sookie to be strong enough not to let any relationship destroy who she was, but it really felt like she both got over Eric too quickly and lost an integral part of her being when their relationship ended. It was like the fire in Sookie just vanished.<br /><br />Also, I had higher hopes for Sookie than continuing her life in Bon Temps. I know that's originally what she wanted, but because she had changed so much and helped so many, I had hoped she would realize her capabilities and want something bigger for herself than what she ever dreamed in Book 1. Once she realized she could do great things, I imagined that she would accomplish great things. It's a great sadness when people who are capable of doing great things and changing lives for the better settle on something comfortable because that's what they know. I hoped she would take the plunge into something unknown and exciting and have a rebirth.<br /><br />And Sam, I've loved Sam since the first book, but Sam was changed as well. I've always loved Sam because of his awkwardness and protectiveness, but also because of his flaws, and it felt as if his flaws were glazed over in the end and explained away in a few lines. Of course death would change anyone, but if he truly meant to fully live the life he had been given, the words of a vampire would have meant nothing to him if he truly loved Sookie. And the romantic tension felt, well, forced.<br /><br />I won't continue on about the little things that bothered me, but for these three characters to completely abandon their development and behave completely unlike themselves in the last book broke my heart. It's as if I awoke one day to find that my three best friends that I've known half my life are really secret agents; I feel like I don't know them at all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The US Navy SEALS do it all!!!  This country needed to hunt and kill that bastard no matter where he was hiding and Only SEAL Team Six is capable of going into another nation and pulling that mission off.  AWESOME book!!!
0783233477|4.0|The movie is great but my enjoyment was diminished because it lacked the closed captions feature which I need because of my hearing impairment.<br />If you know where I can purchase this DVD with the closed captions, I would appreciate your sharing this information with me
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Force closes often, difficult to save pictures and won't allow me to choose order of posts.  But still better then mobile site.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is a look handy. It's stress free and easy to use. You can't say that often enough about apps that are supposed to be &quot;user friendly&quot;. This looks good, works well, has never crashed, and I find myself using it more than I thought I would. I would recommend this calculator to anyone.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I watched it once and I was Hooked.  Its not a chick flic, has a little something for everyone #GoodStuff
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This is definitely a quick, light read. I really like Tina Fey and was looking forward to some good laughs. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of any real content. The book is autobiographical but Tina never reveals anything deeply moving. There is plenty of humor sprinkled throughout but a lot of it requires the reader to be well versed in recent SNL episodes and players. i feel like the book didn't arrive at the finish line as an autobiography or as a humor book.
B005KELWJY|5.0|Nice job.  This product protects my Kindle and is not cumbersome while trying to access, use and even charge the Kindle.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|This concert given in her &#34;back yard&#34; In my opinion is her best work of art! She moved me into tears on several occasions as well as well as into moments of joy!
0553505416|5.0|He can't write a bad book or even a mediocre book.Can't put it down..<br /> Start looking for all his books as you will be hooked.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the book. I am 10years old and l just loved the book. Please Wright another book<br /><br />  Ashley<br /><br />(P.s I loved the book)
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|The movie was great, but it kept stopping and starting over. When we paused it it fast forward to the end. It was really enoying. It made the movie unenjoyable
B005LAIIHG|4.0|The Life of Pi is an adventure story with a touch of mysticism. However, I would NOT advise watching it in the company of small kids, simply because it may be a bit unnerving for them to watch carnivores do their normal - and perfectly natural - things. The film's central character is well cast in his role, And the ending gives room for interpretation on the part of the viewer. I recommend it. .
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This Is A Great Movie, Combining Elements From Strong Hollywood Formulas. But The Animation Is Magic And Breathtaking. Watch It And<br />Enjoy<br />Jb
193700788X|1.0|And she is laughing all the way to the bank. I hardly know what to say, but I sure missed all the vampire main characters; it was like a different book or a spin off and Eric's end - not good at all. I suppose if you want to look at it another way, you could maybe believe he truly loved Sookie and gave up everything (including her) to keep her safe but it wasn't written in such a way to allow us even that. It was just stone cold and a very depressing end. Despite Sam's numerous relationships and constant presence in the book, I have always found him annoying and lacking in sex appeal and even a little repugnant. Now Sookie gets to live in a trailer - what an improvement over her previous circumstances!
B0063GORYU|5.0|The app is well done and addictive! but totally ruined by video ads that interrupt the game and take over the entire screen.
1449410243|5.0|Loved the book, so funny. Better than expected.<br />I you have a cat you will love this book. It's great to have the comics printed.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love this game except for a few minor things. Where did the little exit door go? why must certain activities take so long?
B001V5CIFI|4.0|The precocious children absolutely make this movie. I could have done without the discussion of fa**ing, because now my children have learned a new word! (Thanks a lot, Hollywood.) Other than that, Colin Firth is his usual, self-deprecating cuteness, and Emma steals the show with her quiet, observing self. My children (ages 4&7) absolutely loved this movie.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A brilliant ending to a truly engaging series.  The well-drawn characters are now old and dear friends. May they forever walk in the light.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I just started listening to Reggae and I find that I like me some Marley.  I have been hearing him on my Pandora channel and most of the songs I hear are from this album.<br /><br />So I got it.<br /><br />I Love this Album.
193700788X|5.0|I enjoyed it and will miss my dysfunctional fictional family. I have been with them so many years, sniff, sniff. I got to sit down and have breakfast and coffee with them again and dream of hot summer days, warm tomatoes and deadly friends. I loved how Sookie was not wishy washy anymore she made choices, hard ones and stuck with them. My girl has grown. Many characters from the past came back some to help some to kill. Hey's it's the world she lives in. The wrap up and the final matching was just right for Sookie and her dreams. I wanted one more chapter, just one more.<br />I can't wait for the follow up book on them, After Dead.  I wish CH would put out novellas on some of the side characters every year. I would love to follow Warren, Bubba, Eric, Pam, Alcide.......(hint hint)<br />How do you say goodbye to family ?
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Season four will be turning point on character development and keeping audience's involved.  We shall see how things evolve soon.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book has all of the suspense, scandal, deceit and everything else the HBO Series has... and MORE!!! I love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story, the acting, the photography, the nuanced characterization. I loved everything about it! Why can't wait for the next season.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put the book down. I loved it.  I can not wait until the next book it out.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Hmmmm. I Sierra review this book long so it  boring l had to read it so when I finished I was  glad
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This system works great for traveling. Easy to pack up and take wherever you want to go. We bought it to take on vacation but have used it much more than that. Helps keep kids entertained whilw traveling.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great human perspectives and wonderful story.  I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to my friends of all ages.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|I hesitate to write this because I am fan of their work.<br />The songs on this album are really good. 'Catchy hooks and big beats you can't help but feel moved by. The performances are what you would expect from FOB.<br />The problem: VST overload.<br />When they mixed this album they went a little nuts with the overloaded-distorted-voice plug-in (Un-official name, but you get the idea)<br />I can understand using this effect on some songs, or portions of a song, but there is over-load everywhere on this CD.<br />It's not noise by mistake. They are intentionally making the vocal tracks distorted and, after a while, it's boring. It's not cool. It doesn't make them sound more edgy, it just makes them sound consistently noisy.<br />What shame. This could have been a great album instead of a good, distorted album.<br />There, I said it.<br />Go ahead. Get mad.
B005HSL626|5.0|love love it is awesome it is easy and quick to downlaod love it why cant they make a fruit ninga 2
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It may not be exceptional, but it's good.  If you're looking for something to watch, and you like the genre, you will most likely enjoy Vikings.  I marathoned the first season over a couple of days, was surprised at some of the twists and turns, and overall thought it was pretty solid.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I Love this show! it gets into the real life of lawyers and judges! and the real problems they have. Some quirky judges, and some with a lot of other issues and some things just go on simple things. It lets you look inside other peoples lives you think that with the money they make they should be happy! Not!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Omg, I'm so obsessed with this game!  Didn't think I'd like that it's on a timer but now I compete for best times with my friends!  Very fun game!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|It was okay. It was a good plot. Was not impressed with all roles including the role of the mayor.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|What an awesome adventure! If you like Indiana Jones,then you will like this! I didn't know what to expect,  I thought it was just going to be another kids movie, but was pleasantly surprised!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|To my fellow readers who have invested so much time in this enterprise.  I'm thrilled that we are finally going to have an end.  Did anyone find a plot summary or equivalent anywhere?

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun game and keeps my mind sharp.  Am waiting for the next sequel, only thing I don't like is that solutions are on Facebook and I refuse to put facebook on my computer.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|At first, I just purchased one song.  I ended up purchasing the entire album (clean version) and love it!  Pink has an incredible voice.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Delightful, fun musical. It was humorous and included a list of characters that rounded out the cast to make the movie more viewable.
B00012FXAE|5.0|This DVD is excellent.  First the extra's add a lot of information for the people who love a little history with their movie collection.  This is a must for everyone.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|Everything james rollins writes is golden. never read one of his books that wasn't awesome, and I've turned many others onto his stuff.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I've experienced this scenario in my family and understand how mental illness disrupts the home. Reading this book helps me to have more knowledge of what the person who has the illness is going through.
B000M341QE|5.0|Jack is unbelievable and all the other actors, Great Movie. Watch it several times. Would recommend this video and others
B009PNQUXO|2.0|It does freeze slot. I have delete from cloud and than redone load it. You can not comment on videos you watch.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|Always an excellent choice. This movie is classic turtles. Every kid should see this movie at least 10 times over.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|My Epson wireless printer just keeps kicking out blank pages and there is no clue about what correction to apply. Two different android tablets -- same result!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I worry with each new season that the show will lose its originality and/or good screen writing. This season stayed high quality. The impending arrival of a baby has the group trying to put down roots. Obviously, that is a challenge for a group that must run to survive.
B000F8O35U|1.0|This video looked legit from the outside but the disk looked odd. When we played the movie, it was very dark and grainy. Definitely not a new copy as advertised. I am returning mine. I am SHOCKED that they haven't been penalized for copyright infringement. Don't waste your money!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Was mildly disappointed in this effort by Streisand. Her films usually have  better timing, mix and chemistry.<br />Hard to be her, she is such an massive talent that we all expect so much!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It says you can search for videos. But I can not figure out. It does not freeze so that is good. I think amazon still needs to work on getting a better youtube app.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|While this is useful to determine what WiFi networks appear within range, it lacks any analytic ability, such as indicating which are open networks.  Some additional tools within the system would be much more useful.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A good ending to an original story.  Many parts could have been condensed down to 6- 7 books, but good nonetheless.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Ordered  for the wife to use on long trips and she has a bunch of electronics when she travels.well before I could give it to her the power went out for 6 hrs. and I didn't charge my razor M and I grabbed the Anker  battery pack and gave it a try and it saved me from having no phone,It charged it right up and had plenty left.. Make sure to use the phones original cord.

Especially the feature where u can give yourself Infinite health! Sp get this app because it sure helped me!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|From what I understand of Lincoln's life, this movie was an accurate portrayal of Lincoln as a man and politician. Quite amazing that little has changed from then to now when it comes to the members of Washington.<br /><br />Excellent movie!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It was super duper special awesome'o awesomely superdity especial fudge coated mega great and did i mention it was GREAT!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 13 year old son just loves playing this game! It's one of his favorites on his Kindle. The graphics look great too!
0446614459|2.0|I gave this book 2 stars only because there was something about the premise I really liked. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the writing. I went back to this book three different times, telling myself I would surely enjoy it. Then after a while I saw I was only 22% finished and said, \\"Is that all?\\" and I knew it was over. Just wasn't interesting to me really. I liked the characters, but the story didn't hold my attention.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie. I watched it twice and I never do that. Great acting and story line. It was an eye opener to me to picture how slaves were probably treated.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Fast and reliable. Will continue to rely on this provider for a long time. One of the best shows on TV all time.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was an adorable, emotional journey. I could not put it down. It was recommended to me by a fellow dog owner but turned out to be much more that a silly story but full of life lessons we can all relate to.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Our son in law wanted this for his B-Day. Got it for him and he is amazed at the blu-ray picture. Have to borrow it from him to check it out on mu Blu-ray player.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved it and for $2 was we'll l worth it.  Can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />It was a little short on triple but on.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I saw the movie first and really liked it but I loved the book!  It was a great read, really like this author.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I really love this case. The really great thing is it works in all the positions advertised . The leather is very easy to keep clean, I don't have to worry about it falling to the floor, it  fits exactly and I know it won't fall out.  Love it
B003QSJVOO|5.0|This movie was a lot better than the first two. Everything is still decently campy and happy, but the songs and dances are way better executed.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Essentially this character of Sherlock Holmes has stayed true to the original creation. Be that as it may, he is kind of all over the place with the character and the plot jumps are a bit much. Entertaining but trying to seriously watch the show would be draining.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is excellently made and superbly acted! Unexpected, original, and funny, what more could you ask for! Tarantino delivers again
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie!!!! Riveting! Addressed a very important issue! Denzel Washington was awesome and captivating playing the lead character in this movie!
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Very well acted and a riveting story.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in an excellent period film with historic basis.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|If you are trying to not put your head into a place of destruction, don't watch this.  It is VERY real and well done for what it is.  Just keep in mind it will have a lot of natural disaster violence and all that is associated with that.  The message of thinking about others/love comes through tremendously!  Excellant in that way.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|One word can describe The Hobbit . . . that word is dull. This dull movie captures none of the fun in Tolkien writings. Even the special effects were lackluster and predictable. I am sure glad I didn't waste the money seeing this at the movie house! Save your pennies . . . read the book.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I had already read the book and loved it and I was very surprised at the new ending. It was better than the book's ending.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Very well done. Very well acted. And visually beautiful in all aspects. I love this series hope that it continues.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I have played this app before on an IPhone and it worked great and it was really fun,but if u only have a kindle DON'T GET it doesn't pick up what you are saying all you can do is poke, pet, and slap him that's it, it won't talk.
B001L63JC8|5.0|Very deep album. It seems Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel's creative ideas went opposite directions after this album. One can only wonder what would have been had Gabriel not left the band. This is the last gem in the early genesis era.
037582913X|5.0|My oldest daughter is 43 years old and this was (still is) her favorite childhood book.  She went on to share it with her children.<br />I am now a foster mother and still have the original book that I've first read nearly 41 years ago and read to so many children over the years.  It's becoming tattered to where I've retired it to my closet and bought the new book for my future children.
B007HO392S|5.0|I came to &#34;know&#34; Carrie Underwood when she was on American Idol.  She remains one of my favorite performers of all times.  She is not only a beautiful young woman, but her voice is perfect.  This is truly titled correctly...I am completely BLOWN AWAY!!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|How can a story this unlikely, maybe even preposterous, suck you in and make you believe that every word is true?  I don't know but it does.I have read it twice and it is delightful, exciting terrifying and empathetic all at once.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great book with twists and turns that keep you wanting to read more. Never a dull moment.  If you liked 50 Shades you'll enjoy this series.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Use it on my LG Spectrum smart phone and on my Coby Kyros tablet.  Works great on both devices.  Highly recommend.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Well written but story is predictable. Not much development in characters ending comes with disappointment. It's as if the author was just too tired to write.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|intense - but good movie - inspiring account of what the human body can go through and how love can give you strength to do things you never thought you could.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Anyone who loves music should like this CD.  So, so, so talented!!!  I would recommend this to everyone, no matter if you have a favorite genre or not!
B00000JBFW|3.0|The songs Perfect Strangers and Knocking at your Back Door are great. Rest of album just seems like filler. Wish someone would remaster it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been using this alongside Junos Pulse to connect to my computer at work (through the secure network) as I move around the campus helping users, it has become my greatest ally within a day.<br /><br />The control and functionality is greatly intuitive providing seamless switching between a dual display set-up. This product also provides a high definition and well proportioned view of my machine.<br /><br />A sincere congratulation to the developers, this really is an app to be proud of.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Very handy to be able to read, answer, delete, etc. my Yahoo mail on my phone and tablet.  Would have given it 5 stars if I could figure out how to get it to update when I want it to rather at some random time.
B009NY43NY|1.0|No need to repeat what everyone has already said because I know you will read this book out of duty.  But, in the spirit of venting my frustration...this book was terrible.
B00992CF6W|3.0|lack of depth makes this get old quick.  most features of the full game aren't here.  its basically $7 for slight less game than the free Pc demo.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|This is one our favorite romance movies.  The characters are easy to like, and the story is solid.<br /><br />If you're a romantic at heart this is well worth your time.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie is cute and entertaining, although predictable. Rebel Wilson<br />is memorable as &#34;Fat Amy&#34;, a questionable moniker but good character.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great book, the best that I have read in a long time, kept me guessing right to the end. I couldn't put it down!
B00973902K|5.0|This is just a fun tune to listen to and enjoy, it catches your ear and you are hooked on it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My kids and I love this gave, we can't wait to see what comes out of the eggs - thanks a lot!
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book.  It is fun and encouraging.  One can see light at the end of the tunnel.  Light for those men who want to enjoy their parental rights and also light for those women who do not want to feel guilty for not being 100% perfect
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought the movie was very good. It held my attention the whole way through. The quality of the movie was also very good. I bought the HD version.
B00BF11STU|5.0|A movie which puts the audience right inside the procedural shenanigans and the backdoor dealings both in the back offices and on the field while looking for the most wanted man on earth.<br />This is a non stop thriller that deals with the obsessions of men and woman who devoted their time and sometimes their lives for tracking the man responsible for the greatest terrorist attack in the United States. Maya ( Jessica Chastain) is  one of the stars in the film. The relentless dogged pursuit of Bin Laden's courier is her obsession. Her persistence leads her colleagues at the CIA to question her credibility. `What do you think of her?', asks the CIA director (James Gandolfini). `She's smart,' answers an officer. `We're all smart,' he says.<br />The final raid is nail biting and a cause for a big hurrah for America. The night raid scenes are acting of course but still  are filmed with a vividness that comes close to the scenes that unfolded that moonless night in Abottabad.<br />Many people have condemned this film and the directors pro torture view. I don't think that Bigelow was trying to do that, she was reporting as a good journalist would do the actual events as they unfolded when armed with a film camera. However I feel detection and investigation played a bigger role than just torture.<br />This is an astonishing film to watch and experience - just interesting to watch the way it all unfolds even though we all know how it ends. This is almost a three hour long movie but feels shorter because it is so well made.
B003X27L9U|5.0|I read this book very quickly, and handed it over to my husband, who couldn't put it down either, a great read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read.  Probably the best $1 I've ever spent.  I'll use it as a survival guide should I ever be stranded on Mars.  And I'll be sure to bring disco lights.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|a great game for tablet but with some bugs. so much fun it needs more levels! please add more expansions so that I can crush more levels!
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|It's free<br /><br />Provides a convenient test data source for checking out e-readers.<br /><br />Needs a connection to a more extensive source library
B009NY43NY|5.0|I do confess that this last book is written in a slightly different manner than the other books and it did take me a bit to get into the flow of it (but that could also be because it has been a while sine I read the last book, no rereading for me in the last year) but I think the majority of the reviews here are emotionally unjust. I have read all of the books, most of them several times, and maintain that this was a well rounded ending that both fans and Sookie can and should feel good about. I won't give anything away but if you are a true to book fan there are only so many ways Sookie's story can end and I think this book managed to conclude the story of Sookie almost perfectly with as much intact as could be and everyone in the places that their pragmatic nature would have taken them. Remember the loss of a good character (this being the last book) is like the loss of a good friend but you must look past the moment and deep into the story to see everything. If at first it breaks your heart, read and read again, I am sure the story will find you...
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Best, exotic  are words that come to mind about the acting skills of the people  when one looks at the pedigree of the actors such as Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy,  Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup that make up this film. If you wish to watch some of the best British actors on screen then this is the film to view. This is an adaptation of Deborah Moggach novel' These Foolish Things\\"<br />Dev Patel from SlumDog Millionaire is the bumbling businessman who wants to  outsource retirement to India. He has a hotel that he inherits from his dad and his brochures promise the British retirees retirement nirvana.<br />Obviously there are mishaps, complications and misunderstanding among the guests- all of them except a few are at sea,. Strangers struggling in an environment that is completely alien to them.<br />A widow ( Judi Dench) must find a job and so she does at a call center. Nighy - enjoys India but his  wife can't stand it. A racist woman must get rid of her fear of colored people and hospitals in India. Two lonely souls keep on looking for love in the wrong places. Even the young owner has parental issues stemming from his ownership of the hotel and with his girlfriend Tana Desae and his mother who wants him to give up his dreams and move in with her. Three stars.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy it and  use it most of time  and  its look so good and  great idea things  I enjoy it anyway
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My young grandchildren love this app. It has great graphics and the game is easy enough for little ones to understand.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game isn't what I expected but it has turned out to be really fun.  My son and I play it all the time, now. He absolutely loves it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|great game. awesome grafics and game play. would be a better game and 5 stars if you could earn gems rather than have to purchase to upgrade. also would be an even better game if you would create alternate story line to continue gaining. exp in solo mode more easily
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!!  It brought two people together<br />Who didn't think they deserved love. A must read to understand<br />all they went through!!
B0086900TI|4.0|Kaye the director of American History X complains about everything- especially the public education system and the dying hopes to save it. Adrien Brody is the substitute teacher who is good at his job but refuses to became a permanent teacher choosing to be leave - detached. Detachment is a long laundry list of everything that is wrong with education, sure there are moments of hope in it but they are few. The casting is impressive - Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, and James Caan but all of these sing the same sad song along with the lead. A very depressing movie about the public education system highlighting everything that is wrong with it but without showing the many glimpses of hope that teacher and students encounter everyday. Why does America hate education so much? Three stars. 4/15/2013
1250027624|5.0|If you're hooked on the series, you'll find this book entertaining as well. I liked the intro by Julian Fellows (the author of the series) because he describes many of his relatives that he used as inspiration for the characters. You can pick up and put down the book when you just want to relax for awhile. Also, it's a great value and makes a great gift for others who are also addicted to the show.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Director got carrried away by the cowboy theme a bit too much towards the later part of the movie. Very good acting by django !
B001HNE3NO|5.0|someone recommended this book to me, i had just read the book thief and this fit well with that theme.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|fun fun fun movie .if you think you have trying days check this movie out. harrison ford come through in the end.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Paramore's self-titled fourth album is a strong follow up to the band's third release \\"Brand New Eyes\\". The band's sound has changed a bit. Not surprising, since the band's members have changed.  Instead of a straight pop-punk sound, elements of electronic rock, retro new wave, and indie pop have been incorporated into their usual sound.  I do miss the band's old sound a bit.  Hayley's irresistible attitude is less present and the youthful rebellion has weaned. But bands, especially pop-punk bands, have to grow up. And their new sound works well, and they haven't shed most of the things we've come to love about the band. The guitar riffs and percussion pack a punch, Hayley's voice is still awesome, and often the songs are catchy and have great energy.<br /><br />The lyrical content isn't as strong as their last album though.  The production of this album is their strongest, but the songwriting is a step down. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" has many reflective lyrics, but they are lacking on this album.<br /><br />The opener, \\"Fast In My Car\\", is a power-pop number the echoes girl-led 80s new wave bands.  \\"Now\\", the first single, is a edgy number that wouldn't be out of place on their last album. \\"Part II\\" is one of a few tracks where get experimental.  \\"Still Into You\\" is another power-pop number. \\"Anklebiters\\" is straight, unpolished pop-punk. \\"Hate To See Your Heart Break\\" is one of few ballads on the album. Like a few other tracks, it has an obvious influence of indie singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson.<br /><br />(4.25 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (05.09.2013)
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Baltasar Kormakur remakes his heist film ` Reykjavik-Rotterdam' as Contraband with Wahlberg in as the main lead.  In Contraband he is a reformed criminal who will do a final heist because his wife's brother is in trouble. Contraband is the typical January film that does not pretend and is a predictable twist driven film that promises some fun but nothing spectacular. A great cast NOT including Beckinsale ( who is actually responsible for the plot happenings) is wasted because of mundane sequences and all sparks but no fire in the script. People are tired of such movie but then there are many takers as well....3 stars. 4/25/2013
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so very addictive! I've been playing it now for hours-  already run out of space so will definitely have to buy some.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was very well done. Can't say enough about it. Also can't wait for the next two books to be made into movies.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Had to check this out to compare it to the NetFlix version.  So different - but so much the same.  Just 1990 production values...
B000JLQSWE|5.0|Alan Parson is the best artist of all times. The work is much like a futuristic orchestra.  Hard to believe it was done over 30 years ago.
B00BUCXVPI|2.0|As a fans of TC, i found that this movie is the worst of his movies ever. Rent this is ok but dont buy it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I hate to admit it but I have never read ` Life of Pi\\", I have come close many times to reading it but have never quite got around to finish it. In my opinion the book is quite unfilmable because there are many elements that exist in the book cannot be truly captured for the big screen, but after watching the film adaptation, I have to admit that Ang Lee has done a very good job.<br />There is a shipwreck and Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br />Spiritual questions about faith, meaning of life are the backbone of this film which has been created with the help of CGi. However the CGI is beautiful and drop dead gorgeous. The movie on the whole is very beautiful to watch- possibly the best looking movie in many years- the whale in the night, the scenes in Pondicherry, the Island crawling with meerkats, the squadrons of flying fish, the ocean and the supremely regal Richard Parker. This is a film that celebrates the lush beauty of visual cinema through state of the art CGI: Drop dead gorgeous. Claudio Miranda the cinematographer deserves an applause.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|This is the greatest Robert De Niro movie you've never seen filmed in gorgeous South American locales with amazing set pieces and sweeping spectacles.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book. It was out there but a good read. I enjoy reading my favorite book on the Kindle Iam ancious to take it to the beach to see how it does in the sunlight.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Not only can you see all the episodes marathon style, but you get those extras that bring so much more info to those of us that admire the British series.  A great buy.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|The words to some of the songs make me laugh.  Great!  The way Alan Parson Mixes it all together is unbelievable.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Thought it was one of the finest films ever!  Daniel Day Lewis was just superb. Revealed that dirty politics was going on even then- if the facts are accurate and I trust that Spielberg did his research.  Will watch this one over and over again.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Great soundtrack! Expect nothing less from M83. I personally love the  changes in the music. You can here the suspense,the mystery,the action,the sorrow.<br /><br />Love it!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Worth watching again. Nice entertainment. Tears from laughing and crying. Streisand should act some more. You really believe her character. I see a lot of myself in the 60's with his character.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|I like this game, I have no played it enough to really the the hang of it. I have not been very lucky at getting good scores.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|I stumbled across this group while brushing my teeth<br />and heard their video on tv...what a tight group<br />great vocals and sound...up for a grammy this year<br />just watch
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|I Love it.  Makes me want to dance. Has a western poker game feel to it.  Only Alan Parson could mix so many great sounds.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|She is just a delight to listen too.  Her interpretations of each song is endearing and the duets are delightful. She can really hold her own!!
B0030IG0C6|5.0|Since my six year old granddaughter is at this point in her life mad about unicorns, this really pleased her.  It is next to her bed on her nightstand and she plays with it consistently.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I didn't make it through the whole movie. I stopped at the one hour mark. I wouldn't recommend it. Boring. I don't understand all the hype with the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to see facebook on my Kindle.<br />Would reccommend this to anyone. I have access to it 24/7.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Movie arrived in good time and condition. I love the Marvel movies and so enjoyed this movie. Thank you Marvel for another good movie.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|It reminds me a little like back ground sounds for cartoons.  It is amazing the work Alen Parsons did 30 Years ago. Great!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The actors- superb.  I didn't know that Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe could sing AND Anne Hathaway just blew me away with her rendition of I Had A Dream.  Another movie I will watch over and over again.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I have liked all of the American pies movies, I'm so glad they are always able to keep the same actors.  If you have watched all of them through the years, you feel like you know these funny goof balls.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is a great story with unexpected twists that is sure to stay with me.  Now that I know the end, I will read it again.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great cant wait for 3rd and 4th season. This is s good series and I hope they keep marketing the HBO special.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, it's a little too easy of a read. but it's a fun get out of your world entertainment.  Waiting to find out what happens next relationship wise was my favorite parts of this and the other two books. Give it a shot and read:)
B000NJVWUA|5.0|It is Great Alan Parson was way ahead of the time.  I wish I could get more.  I like to snap my fingers.  The music is very Complicated, and you need a good since of how it is made to really understand it.  Love it.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|When I was invited to my Grand-daughters dance class 'SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW' was playing. I just fell in love with the arrangement so I ordered the CD.  Now whenever my Grand-daughters visit they ask me to put on the &#34;Hula Man&#34; and dance along.  I also like his rendition of &#34;It's a Wonderful World&#34;.  Hours of entertainment.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|WOW what a great movie, if you like ex-military type movies, you will love this movie. Tom Cruise plays the perfect role as an ex-military cop bad ass! a must watch!!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I don't like having to go through Facebook to use the full version of the game. Not everyone is into Facebook.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|would recomend to anyone who likes dective novels. I like buying for my kindle and I share with my wife.I think I read most of Mr. Connellys work ,they are allways entertaining.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|This movie was probably one of the worst, most boring movies I've ever seen.  I actually had a hard time giving it one star!!
B000FA675C|5.0|A great read..imaginative, witty, twisting plots and a learning experience to be had in the meantime.  Who could ask for anything more?
B008QI6EHQ|1.0|This body of work represents the writings of a brilliant but insane monster with a distorted view of mankind. He was nothing more than a Psychopathic genius who charismatically influenced ignorant people to destroy a society. It was quite an experience to get inside the brain of this inhuman monster.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I never liked movies where the actors broke out into a dance.  However, I liked what this movie did, showing you can protest in a quite interesting way.<br /><br />I really like it.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|The entire series of Spartacus has been terrific. Yes, it is pretty bloody and I am not a fan of blood and guts on a regular basis. The story line, character development, acting and of course the incredible looking bodies of the men on the show peak my female interest.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Excellent storyline, acting and production values.  So much of what passes for futuristic or science fiction in current movies is based on mind-numbing special effects, but the Hunger Games has a thought-provoking story and solid character development to keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|I have been a fan of Rod's for a long-time and was disappointed to think that Rod had given up song writing all together.  But with the album \\"Time\\" Rod demonstrates his great song writing capabilities he had back in the 70's this time reflecting on his life experiences.  I have always loved his unique voice and his ability to sing a variety of music is mached by no others in the music industry.  His Great American Songbook's were excellent as well as a few cover albums he did and not to mention his latest Christmas Album, but with \\"Time\\" Rod is back to story telling which he has always been great at when he applied his talent in that direction.  You can truly learn so much by listening to his music as he has been around the block a time or two.  All the way from \\"Moment of Glory\\" where you find that keeping your banana in the fruit bowl and staying faithful to your significant other is far more worth that 15 minutes of Glory to \\"Live the Life\\" where he says you don't have to go all over the world looking for happiness and satisfaction - it's in your own backyard.  Great Job Rod!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Before I read this book I viewed running as a chore that had to be done in order to stay in somewhat decent shape. Now I find enjoyment in running trails and I look forward to my runs, not dread them. This book changed my mindset and helped explain a little bit about what was wrong with my approach to running. Great stories are told with a great authorial voice. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story and especially to those who are exercised inclined. My wife is even reading this book now (and she loves it), and she never reads books.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Like the game but they should have a promotion when you run out of peanuts you should get more that's better
B004UPANAI|5.0|I did not know what to expect, but a friend told me to watch it.  I'm so glad I did it was a great movie. I cant wait to watch the new Wolverine movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I needed something to keep me occupied for a while, and I had a blast for about 5 hours straight with this game. The story line actually makes sense, the graphics are the best I've seen on a game yet, and the hidden object games were just the right amount of challenging with fun. Definitely worth the few bucks.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have been a fan since American Idol and was lucky enough to see Adam perform in Bethleham PA after the release of For Your Entertainment.<br /><br />Trespassing does not disappoint and shows even more of Adam's versatility.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Great movie! Makes me so thankful we have these men on our side defending our lives and country. They give up so much that we have no idea about. It's scary how close some of the calls can be.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Not so much scary as it was spooky. Very interesting movie, although I can't say that I would watch it very often.
0385344228|4.0|At first I felt like I was reading a Piccoult  book with the underlying theme of &#34;Criminal Gene&#34; but  as I got into the book I was impressed with his style of writing and character development.  And I did not anticipate the ending.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie. Great acting. Great writing. The Hobbit is exactly what I was hoping it would be and it is. Lengthy it is, but at the end I'm wishing there was a couple hours more as it left me wanting more! Can't wait for the next one to hit the box office!
B000FBJF6Y|3.0|I tried this book because I'd heard great things about it and because it's set in Botswana - a country that doesn't generally get a lot of play in English-speaking literature.<br /><br />As a typical neurotic North American, I found the portrayal of the Motswana mindset with its lack of neurosis and obsessive self-analysis a welcome change of pace from my own day-to-day experience. Given that the series is written by a Scottish man it's entirely possible that this attitude is complete fiction - but what an appealing fiction! I'm not going to lie - if appropriation of voice is one of your pet peeves, you're going to hate this book.<br /><br />It's a quick read. The writing style is simple and straightforward while still maintaining a distinctive voice. Precious Ramotswe may be a young woman in modern day Botswana, but her relaxed attitude, cunning mind, and seen-it-all-before analysis of different personality types brings to mind the elderly Miss Marple of St. Mary Mead. It's no wonder that Agatha Christie is one of Mma Ramotswe's heroes.<br /><br />Recommended for a good summer read on one of the hottest days of the year (early to mid August would be good). If it's too hot to do anything but put your lawn chair in the shade and immerse yourself in a book, this would be that particular book.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|When watching the movie in the theaters, the soundtrack really added to the suspense and excitement of the movie.  Now after buying it and listening to it more, it really is a great one that is different than others, but amazing sounds and unique.  Highly recommended!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Have enjoyed this game! problem is, my grandsons do also and keep pushing matches while I am trying to play!! Will have to get them their own Kindles!!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Maria Brink can yell better then some guys in bands. \m/ (*_*) \m/ The album A+++++'s all the way give it a listen.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Graphics are great and action is entertaining.  Working on my skill level and learning what the special pieces do. I have this on my Kindle and play during &#34;down time&#34;.
B007IK44CK|3.0|I didn't even mean to buy this. I have amazon prime and I accidently bought this even though it's on Prime. I felt stupid and raped
B00012QM8G|5.0|GREAT MOVIE THAT SERVES AS A PRIMER OF THE HOLOCAUST.  BOTH UPLIFTING AND DEPRESSING AT THE SAME TIME, IT PARSES THE HUMAN SOUL INTO ITS GOOD AND EVIL HALVES.  WHILE SOME MAY ARGUE IT TREATS SCHINDLER A BIT TOO SYMPATHETICLY, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE ACTIONS HE TOOK IN THE FACE OF BARBARISM.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I love this dvd combo. the dvd itself gives you a great glipse at Adele as an artist. She really is adorable and relatable The cd of the songs she sings is always in rotation in my car. My favorites are 'Hometown Glory' and 'I Can't Make You Love Me'.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoy Dr. Who! We think 'it just can't get any better!&#34; and it does! Thanks to the writers!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series and super smooth playback through my amazon apps. I was too impatient to wait for the re-run on PBS, so having this episode immediately made my day!
B00BC5KV42|4.0|Worth having as a baseline reference. Additional photographs of higher quality would make it five stars.  Good background on various equipment is nice to have.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I am so happy we have someone that is showing the rest of America that Seattle is incredible... Just don't move here. We like it how it is
B009AMANBA|5.0|FANTASTIC FILM ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THE CIVIL WAR.  THE ACTING IS SUPERLATIVE, THE COSTUMES AND SETTINGS IMMACULATELY ACCURATE, AND THE STORY CONCERNING THE ADOPTION OF THE 13TH AMENDMENT INSPIRING.  WHILE SOME MIGHT ARGUE IT IS SLOW IN A FEW PLACES, WELL SO IS LIFE.  BASED ON A BOOK BY DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN THIS IS AS CLOSE AS HOLLYWOOD GETS TO HISTORY.
B00CM96A60|4.0|Great music... Did not expect anything less from AVB... Saw this in Ultra 2013<br />Keep it up<br />Cannot wait for Ultra 2014
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|The action wasn't great, bad guy wasn't compelling at all, and even the good guy wasn't very compelling. It got better as it went  on, but still one of the weaker individual Avenger movies.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|The world has changed.<br /><br />This is the guiding mantra of Marvel Studio's latest offering, Iron Man 3.<br /><br />Following the alien invasion that devastates New York City and nearly costs Tony Stark his life in The Avengers, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a changed man. He has panic attacks. He spends his nighttime hours designing new Iron Man suits instead of sleeping. He hides himself at home, often projecting the Iron Man as a shield of defense. (I can't say more without spoilers.) Even the way he speaks is changed. Though still present, the confident, snarky humor that characterized Stark in the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers is toned down in Iron Man 3.<br /><br />The result of these changes is that perhaps for the first time, audiences get a deep look at a Marvel hero who seriously struggles with the monumentally strange events that have come to shape his life. (Some of this was done for Captain America in The Avengers, but he quickly suits back up.) This leads to a more intimate investment in Tony Stark than conjured by the previous films and makes this film stronger than the last two.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the change in the world that darkens Stark's mind hemorrhages into the rest of the script, at times needlessly creating a darker world.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 finds our hero battling the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), a new breed of super terrorist who loves blowing things up and leaving no evidence of any kind that can be traced back to him. Through the course of the film, we see some of these attacks and their aftermath. Anyone near the blast is incinerated instantly, leaving human shaped scorch marks for the audience to look at.<br /><br />These images are violent and unsettling. But there are more.<br /><br />This time, Stark has no qualms about shooting bad guys. \\"I'm going to kill you first,\\" he tells one of the Mandarin's henchmen. Along with Col. Rhodes' War Machine (Don Cheadle)--rebranded as the Iron Patriot--Stark shoots lots of baddies throughout the film, though he lets one run away when the henchman drops his gun and exclaims that he hates his job.<br /><br />The end result is that a lot of people die before the credits roll--many more than in previous entries in the Iron Man and The Avengers series. From this we see that the world really has changed. The typically light, fun Marvel summer blockbuster is taking on an increasingly dark and heavy tone, suggesting that Americans are only ever more paranoid about the world's many dangers.<br /><br />By itself the tone isn't a persistent problem, but it's also coupled with too many characters with no motivation. Typical henchmen are usually not given any backstory in movies, which is appropriate as the movie's two hours should be spent developing the protagonist and villain. But in this film, the Mandarin employs several U.S. army recruits who volunteer to become super soldiers in his private army. They are central to his plans. But why these previously good men and women turn evil is not explained, leading to a plot that is too cartoonish even for a comic book movie.<br /><br />Overall, though, the film is still very enjoyable. Stark's character is more human and superhuman than ever, and the spectacle of the action scenes is state-of-the-art and not to be missed. The world has indeed changed, leading Marvel in a mostly strong direction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book, it was different and hard to put down. After finishing it I ordered the following book and really like what Susanne Collins has done to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  This movie shows you not to trust strangers.  Also, not to go off on your own.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|FANTASTIC VERSION OF THE ROBIN HOOD FABLE PUT ON FILM IN 1938 BY WARNER BROTHERS.  ERROL FLYNN IS DASHING, OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND HAS  NEVER BEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL, AND THE WARNER STOCK-COMPANY FROLICS ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|well I have to say never get tried of whaching the seasons more the once great flick and actors nice
B000T433CO|5.0|This film has all the essentials for a good romantic comedy.  The characters are dealing with real life situations in a quirky and fun way; making them believable yet funny.  I laught and cried with them.  A tue classic.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|CAUTION: IF PREDISPOSED TO SLIGHT INCONTINENCE AVOID READING THIS BOOK. YOU MAY WELL LAUGH SO HARD AS TO WET YOURSELF.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very different and hard to put down, I have already started reading the other Hunger Games book and would recommend this book.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Great move western love story With action and romance. An African-American cowboy slave hero lover what more can you Ask for And a movie That is full of surprises
B00003CXA6|4.0|THIS FILM COINCIDED WITH THE CIVIL WAR CRAZE SWEEPING AMERICA, AND WAS RIGHTLY HAILED AS A FAITHFUL PAEN TO THE MEN WHO \\"GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE\\" FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED.  IT WAS ALSO A FAITHFUL RECITIATION OF THE NOVEL, AND WHILE ITS PG-13 VIOLENCE DID NOT CONVEY THE REAL TRAGEDY OF A CIVIL WAR, IT WAS SATISFYING ENOUGH.  OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES BY JEFF DANIELS, MARTIN SHEEN AND TOM BERENGER HIT THE RIGHT NOTE HISTORICALLY.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It was very well written. I couldn't put it down! It was very fun! Leave the past where you left it!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|A well written sci-fi movie.  A normal high school boy, dealing with dating, love, high school, class bullies, parents and all other forms of teen-age drama; who just happens to be an alien with special powers!  A fun ride!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|What an awesome movie.  Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper kill it!  They both play their roles really well, have great chemistry with each other, and the supporting cast is amazing!  The acting is all-time in this movie.  Even Chris Tucker, who I haven't seen since the Rush Hours, has an awesome role .<br /><br />Having great actors doing great acting is only part of the equation though, you need a solid script for a movie to transcend good into great, and this movie definitely has that.  It was like Quentin Tarantino and Todd Phillips had a baby and named it this.  The dialogue that comes out of their mouths is riveting, at times funny, and at times breaks your heart.<br /><br />I am most sure this movie has excellent and extensive reviews on here already, so I won't bother, but this is a must see!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great read - the author is funny as it can be, and keeps the pace throughout the entire time - really interesting also as it is intertwined with science facts all over - absolutely a fantastic piece!!
B004GUS7VE|2.0|very dated and boring.  Pretty meaningless and banal  Ok for its time but that has passed. Not worth the time spent reading it
B00005JPLW|4.0|GRAPHIC AND BLOODY, THE STAND BY THE SPARTANS AT THERMOPYLAE IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT MOMENTS THAT CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY.  LEONIDAS IS STALWART AND APPROPRIATELY GRIM, BUT THE BACK STORY OF HIS WIFE BACK IN SPARTA DULLS THE ACTION.  WHILE NOT EXACTLY HISTORY, SIT BACK AND ENJOY.  P.S. --I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY SOME MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLES MAY FIND THE MUSCLE FLEXING BY THE CRADLE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION UPSETTING.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|An interesting book written by a neurosurgeon who claims that he made a journey to Heaven after a serious illness.  From what he expresses it is difficult to dispute his claims.  Believers in Jesus Christ, according to Dr. Alexander, have a lot to look forward to after we leave this earth and all of its problems.  Even if you are a believer in God this book causes you to give thoughts to what the afterlife will hold.  Very good reading.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|This is a classic journey through the eye of those who suffered the dust bowl and the depression.<br />However, the ending was a non-plus.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a good movie, not great, but good.  The acting was outstanding, but look who we're dealing with here!  If the acting was anything other than outstanding, we'd have a problem.  The script was good too, as in the lines that were spoken, and this is proving to be Tarantino's wheelhouse.<br /><br />Not his best film, not even close, but you'll still get the shock value from a Tarantino film that you've come to love.  This film is made to model the spaghetti-westerns and it does a really good job of that; right down to the unrealistic gun fights.<br /><br />I'll give this movie a 4 based on Leo Dicaprio's role in this movie alone.  At this point, I believe that dude is my favorite actor in hollywood.  This movie is average until he comes in and becomes truly Tarantino-esque from that point on.<br /><br />--SPOILER--<br />My one complaint, though, and it is nagging at me, is why ON EARTH Dr. King Schultz would shoot Leo in the middle of his mansion knowing the amount of gun-hands that were on the plantation.  He was a really smart dude, the movie takes care to establish this, and yet he puts his (only?) friend, and his just acquired long-lost wife, in a crap-storm of blood and bullets by doing this and his excuse is &#34;Sorry, I just couldn't resist&#34; or something like that.  Just shake his hand, get out of there, and then come back and get your revenge.  I feel like this is lazy plot development/writing here because it was an easy way to create a huge gunfight and a SEEMINGLY more dramatic ending.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Too dark for my taste...I thought it was a waste of my money.  Not what I expected...very disappointed Hope this will be the last one.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Big fan of the franchise from day one and always wanted to buy this collector's edition set for awhile now but being priced at $129 seem a tad too steep for a movie that's almost 20 years old since the first inital release of Jurassic Park. I'm not gonna review the movies since it will be biased and there are already millions review out there for all of you to read. But grabbing this set for $50 was a steal! The Dinosaur figure was done to perfection and the Bluray conversion, although a slight grainy with the first  and second movie (understandable since film quality wasn't great back in the 90's and converting those films to HD is a stretch) is very forgivable once you hit the 3rd film. The discs are loaded with all the added commentaries, cast interviews, etc... to your delight. But again for $50, a bargain of a lifetime!
B00003CXAA|5.0|THE FIRST FILM WAS A MASTERPIECE, THE SECOND FILM A MASTERPIECE PLUS, AND THE THIRD INSTALLMENT MARKED THE MORAL/PERSONAL DEGENERATION OF THE MAIN CHARACTER.  WHILE THE FIRST TWO NEVER DISAPPOINT, THE THIRD INSTALLMENT STRETCHES CREDULITY A BIT.  HOWEVER THE THIRD FILM ALONE IS STILL GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Top notch in campy horror. Save yourself the question and watch Evil Dead for the answer- if you're an OG horror fan, you won't regret it!
B0016CTXTU|4.0|Wow- I have never heard of Eloy before. For me the music grabs you first and I have no problems whatsoever with the accent issue some people have. It's great prog the way I love it!
B00BESJYAY|3.0|What this movie does well is it opens the experience up to everyone and doesn't pigeonhole itself into the surfing genre.  It focuses mostly on Jay's character and his relationship with Frosty, not just on surfing, which I think kept it off the chopping block.  It also does a good job of explaining, and showing, how dangerous Mavericks really are.<br /><br />Gerard Butler should not have played Frosty though, in my opinion.  He is a good actor, and I love a lot of his work, but I don't really think this role was for him (to show what I mean, I think Matthew McConaughey would've been perfect here).  He is really the only big name in the film, other than Elizabeth Shue (if you can count her anymore), so he probably anchored it for marketing purposes.<br /><br />Mad props to Jonny Weston, though, he did a really good job as the naive teen who just wants to get out there and surf but gets pulled into all this drama and bull-crap with his mom, his love interest, and his best friend.  I didn't know who Jay Moriarity was before this film and it was at least good enough to make me research this guy afterwards.<br /><br />What brought this movie down to a 3 for me was just general, nit-picky stuff (like Butler playing Frosty), so I won't waste your time with it here (as you may not agree with it all).  If you love surfing, you'll love this movie.  Based on a true story doesn't really mean anything anymore as cinematic liberties are taken at will these days (research will show that here, too).<br /><br />Good movie for you if the plot/cover alone piques your interest; an okay movie if it doesn't.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. The story was interesting, and it was acted well. Keeps you interested until the final scene. A good movie night flick.
B001J20ZIA|5.0|My son loves insects and this is one of his favorite movies.  He is 5.  My wife and I don't care for it much though.
B005MLOKXA|2.0|I thought it was dull and not worth my time. 10 more words required 6 more words required.  2 more words required
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supenatural is a great show.  The show keeps you on the edge of your seat even in the filler episodes.  If your looking for a new show to watch give it a try.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I was really disappointed. I was on pins and needles waiting for this movie to come out. I wanted to see it enough to buy it for 14.00 instead of waiting for renting for 3.00. This movie was so different from the book I was so glad I read the book first. The book is waaay better and I am reading the 2nd one right now. Still frustrating how they strayed so far from the book. Even the great ending they managed to screw that up. I love the books Beautiful Creatures and I say don't waste your time renting this movie. If I would of seen the movie first I would of never read the books.
B00BESM14U|4.0|A very good dark, teen-angst movie.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Logan Lerman from &#34;3:10 to Yuma&#34; and &#34;Meet Bill&#34; (both solid selections if you haven't seen them) and his acting chops really shine in this one.  There were just a few parts that seemed too &#34;tweeny&#34; for me, but all in all, this movie tackles some tough subjects and does a really good job.<br /><br />The directing is what carries this movie though because there are 3 key scenes that are executed really well and I believe that is what creates a realistic vibe that you can relate to.  An example being when he is told to kiss the most attractive female in the room.<br /><br />This should be a teen movie most people can get into.  However, you can easily throw this into the dark, artsy, teen genre and if those 3 things are not your preferred brand of movie, then you can at least stare at Emma Watson the whole time.  If that isn't your thing, either, then you probably oughta skip this selection.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I've read other books by this author and this was the best.  In previous novels, there was alot of French words that made the story hard to follow, but not in this one.  The story was believeable.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Excellent. Really give you all you need and it looks sharp I am really happy I brought such a nice item from amazon
B007RJV1IC|5.0|I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR MANY YEARS... I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I FOUND IT!! ;-)<br /><br />I ONLY WISH I COULD DOWNLOAD IT AFTER I WATCHED IT.. APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT BEFORE YOU WATCH IT OTHERWISE YOU CAN'T DOWNLOAD IT ANYMORE.. ;-(
B005HED08I|5.0|I grew up on &#34;The Next Generation&#34; and saw some re-runs of the original. I reaaly enjoyed getting into the original story and the inspiration for all of the more recent spin-offs. Great show for anyone who likes Sci-FI
0062014536|4.0|This book, the final in the series, is not quite as action filled as the second book, but does a nice job of wrapping up the story.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Lena, who has escaped the bonds of the city and is living in the Wilds. And her best friend Hana, who has had the anti-love procedure and is set to marry the new mayor.<br /><br />Picking up where Pandemonium left off, Lena is in a love triangle when she discovers that Alex is still alive. They then wander around in the woods for awhile, a bit Deathly Hallows-ish, then meet up with other revolutionaries and the book takes off from there.<br /><br />Knowing how this series ends, I do recommend it to people who enjoy Dystopian YA. And now that all three books are out, you can actually read them back to back.<br /><br />[...]
B0017SWPXY|5.0|the whole book was wonderful. i am a huge animal lover and although parts of this book was heartwrenching, it was well worth reading.  loved the ending  thankyou!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is one of the few newfangled App gizmos that is worthy of my precious time.  My time on this Earth is finite, limiited, not to be wasted.  Not here, not this application.  Thanks, developers, whoever, wherever you are.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|It has been cloudy ever since I purchased the app, but what few stars visible were identified quickly and accurately. Works as expected and will be useful when working with the kids identifying the stars
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this is just as good a game as the one that comes with my computer, and it certainly lets me win and lose just as frequently.  Hope you'll try it!
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|A refreshing take on the value of giving, nicely blending interesting anecdotes with research data.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, and instantly attempted to categorize myself as either a Giver or a Matcher -- terms used in the book that will now be engrained in the 21st Century business jargon -- which was quickly followed by me categorizing most successful leaders as Takers.  I can't imagine that, after reading this book, any high-performing business leader would identify his/her self as a Taker.  After reading this, I am itching for a sequel that extols the virtue of taking -- something to remove the taint of idealistic optimism that lingers in my mind.  After all, if there were no Takers, Givers would never exist.  And that would be a real travesty.  Net/net -- a really fascinating read that will get you thinking.
1476715904|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I'm not sure what to think. I don't know if I even liked it. But there was definitely something about Slammed that made me read it in a day.<br /><br />Ok so `slammed' refers to poetry slam which is so freaking amazing and unique! It was actually my favourite bits to read out of the whole book. Wait! Nope...it definitely was! No question.<br />I think the main thing that I noticed was that the story progressed rather quickly. Will and Lake go on a date (ha rhyming) in the first few chapters. And then it was like they couldn't breathe without the other one. It was definitely insta love..which is annoying, but in a weird sense it sort of works the more you read on. At times I did find Lake to be incredibly immature, even though she was described as being the complete the opposite. There was a scene where Will confronts Eddie and Lake and they were making all of these Chuck Norris jokes - although I am a fan of a good Chuck Norris slamming I just sort of was like `ok' and skipped over a few pages.<br /><br />The repetition of describing or mentioning the `stages of grief' was a bit unnecessary, but it didn't ruin the overall book for me. Honestly I think this book had a lot of potential but it was just lacking several things. If the whole book was just of poetry I would have given it a 5/5. It was in those moments that you got to see the raw emotions and fears that surrounded each of the main characters. Besides these moments everything just seemed too happy...maybe happy is the wrong choice of word. Because although these characters were dealing with such tough situations it was sort of like the universe was on repeat and everybody ended up fitting into these neatly designed parcels called life where everything and everyone becomes happy. Which I guess is one of the key themes in this book in regards to death & life. Overall I think that there were too many heavy issues that these characters had to deal with, which isn't unlike reality, but I'm not sure that the execution was fluid enough.<br /><br />It was a rather easy read which I liked after finishing a monster of a book prior to starting this one.  I think i'll read the next one because there is just something about it that I liked, but can't pin point as to exactly what. Ah. Don't you hate it when that happens.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Really good movie with nice blend of action, comedy and good story. You won't be disappointed with this Cruise flick
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This was okay,  Glad I watched from home and did not spend the movie theater price.  Worth watching.  Not as good as the trailer makes it appear.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|I'm getting a little tired of hearing this playing 3 times a day, but my kids love this movie (& the mini movie). Just plain fun
B000000OQF|5.0|I fell in love with guns and roses because of this cd. I play it almost everywhere I go and it has great quality. The product was shipped fast and has a great price.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro are great in this film! It was an interesting look at mental health.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u love horses this is a fun one to play. just like if u own a real one everything is there to do in its caretaking.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read a later book in the series and needed to see how it started. Needless to say, I'm hooked.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I know it was the beginning of the story, but it left me feeling disappointed. The story is being dragged out just a bit to much.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|I became addicted to this record. I listened to it over 20 times the first week and then bought 2 other Neil Young records. Walk Like a Giant and Ramada Inn are epic.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Was looking for MTG on kindle fire and this tcg was a good enough substitute. Hard to go far fast without spending real money but very doable.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|If one knows anything about samuri movies they will know that this is the ultimate classic. It is redone beautifully and has extras that are very interesting and worth watching.
B008KU67Q8|5.0|I ordered this as the follow up to If She Stays. My students love it!! It stays checked out constantly.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game, but you have no choice but to buy invest points constantly in order to accomplish anything in the game. Hard to track your vehicles and tedious to make buildings
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Disappointed, expected better writing.  Didn't care for the author and his story.  Might be good for college kids.  As a senior, didn't interest me.  Story was kinda corny.  Not intriguing as a romance novel if that's what u call it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love Sherlock's quirky manner.  Not over done. The best I have seen.  There were times when I laughed out loud. That is my true test of a really good program. So entertaining!!!!<br />Cannot wait for the new season!
B00846REIS|5.0|If your wanting a love story here it is. It will keep you guessing and gives you that rush like fifty shades.
B00138H1RS|5.0|Cool jazz from Miles. Music for reading Hemmingway. I listen to this on Long drives through the Arizona desert. It keeps me cool and focused.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great ending to the trilogy! loved Christian Grey's transformation from the first to the 3rd book. And they lived happily ever after..
B004CFAWK2|5.0|She captures my attention just by reading the first paragraph..and I can't put the book down until I finish it. Down home humor and her characters are earthy and seem so real.<br /><br />I am never disappointed with a Fannie Flagg book!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I enjoy the game but four times took money and gave no chips still not fixed, I got emails saying they are working on it than asked me to send them my emails showing I paid?And have not heard or got chips nothing game great but loosening money not?It's been over two weeks now plus tried to get bingo chips on face book and that didn't work
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is not exactly a normal love affair , it evolves into a blooming experience of what a person can learn to endure and learn  as they try to be in a relationship with someone who has been mistreated and taught that this too is love in a way
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|it is an awesome app for my  device,  it has most of the features of a core calculator like basic operations  , however the lack of extras functions in trigonometry and other scientific  limits me in my everyday needs
B001OSIV62|5.0|I'm too young to remember when this happened, and in fact I hadn't known about it at all until I saw the film.  Great interviews and a nice recounting of events.  Such an incredible story...
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. Well written and interesting story. One of these books one want to keep reading to find out what happens.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Nothing like a good Sherlock Holmes mystery and this has them all! I enjoyed this tome and you will too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was brillant, Hopefully it keeps getting bigger and better,<br />I love these kind of books, there are real but not in a way
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Did exactly what it said it would. I was able to view my file with much ease. I recommend this product
B008XG1X18|4.0|I gave it a four because sometimes it will load a photo and freeze my device! so I have to shut it off and restart. Its annoying!
B003AKEGRK|5.0|The depth and intensity of this story is truly unrivaled.  The film is masterfully crafted and exceedingly cool.  Some may sell this movie as a martial arts action flick, for which it certainly has merit, but as a character-driven thriller, this film really shines.  It's raw and sometimes completely unrelenting, but once it's over, and you've taken a shower, you still might not be able to scrub the stain off your psyche.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Just loved this book - loved the story, the characters and the writing style. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B000SEGEKI|3.0|Lots of the content is still very relevant today, but the book could use a bit of a re-write to bring the examples up to date.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Nonstop action from start to finish!! I loved the way it was written...really pulls you in and leaves you fiending for more!
B007PKSN6Q|1.0|I hated this cd. Wish it had the real singer of the songs on it. And I'm not happy I bought it
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Guilt Trip promised to be a comedic adventure starring the incomparable Barbra Streisand and up and coming Seth Rogan but it just doesn't deliver. There are some mildly funny scenes but it seems many opportunities  to exploit the situational set ups miss the mark. I know Barbra can do much better. Seth Rogan comes across as being miscast for this role. If you're really bored and need some light entertainment, this might be ok but not if you have high expectations like i did. Give it a pass.
B000OW8DW6|5.0|I had the privilege to see this film in theatres at its release.  I was drawn in because I had become a fan of Clive Owen, and had enjoyed Y Tu Mama Tambien.  What I got was a slick, exciting, and jaw-dropping experience that had me, a cynical, hard-to-impress film snob, completely completely at its mercy.  There are a couple of truly long, single-take action sequences which still awe me.  If you haven't seen this movie, watch it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Shipped as advertised and was perfect addition to a classroom project we were working on.  I'm very pleased that the order arrived as advertised.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is a great sequel to the previous two. Makes you want know, what more twists and turns there are as the story goes on.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|So glad I got this cd. And I'm so glad I add this to the rest cds. bon jovi is great
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My daughter is seven years old and in the 2nd grade.  She loves to play this game.  Not sure if it will help with future math or not, but it seems to be a lot of fun.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I read the books, and of course the show differs, but I think the show is great. The attention to detail is impeccable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's a great game for me how I beat my dad's high score his was about 1297546 and i got 1579248 so competing with him is fun and how the game is makes it great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed American Sniper. I have read many many books about the SEALs and other special operations forces. In my opinion, most SEAL books spend way too much time talking about BUDs. I'm glad Chris didn't do that in his book. He could have been a little more detailed when describing his encounters with the enemy. But that wont keep me from giving this book 5 stars, because that's just the way Chris told his story. And it surely is an amazing one. Chris was Brutally straight forward and honest in the book, simply telling it how things are. He was one of the most humble and greatest warriors the world has ever known! Honor him and all those like him. Get American Sniper and READ it! RIP Chris Kyle!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is just like the second one to come out to the Ds, so you can use adjectives. I don't have very many problems with it. If you pay the $2 for the game and world pass you at least get 120 levels and all future worlds! If you shake the screen, an error pops up saying &#34;Warning, you are about to delete all man made objects.&#34; And sometimes if freezes but other than that it is a great game. I would recommend it.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|This was one of the best of its time.  I liked it then and like it now. The girls who sing are the best.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I loved this book. its the best comic i've read. i also like the tv show of it.i think its epic. im onliy 11 but i loved it
B006PKQQJS|5.0|This game is exactly like the computer version! It is worth the money! It is  really fun & addictive. I love how the levels are hard & easy at  the same time.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This app is amazing! It does just what it says, and works exactly like it should. Very stable I haven't had any dissatisfaction.
B0095P31L6|5.0|As a computer graphics professional, I can say that Rango pushes the bar of visual quality up several notches above anything I've seen to date.  The shaders, texturing, animation, simulation, lighting, art direction, etc, etc, was really stunning to me (and I'm sure, completely lost on most people - lol).  The story is pretty solid - free from the political undertones of recent Pixar releases - and I've watched Rango more than once which is pretty rare for me - although I can't say whether that's to marvel at the technical aspects, or enjoy it for it's entertainment value.  Either way, it's worth checking it out ;)
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Gave me insight on myself why I'm moody at times, didn't realize that much needed downtime could be the reason
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This a great game, keeps you busy and you learn how hard the work is to keep the business running and keep your customers happy. In some instances if you pay attention you can tell your hottest selling items, type of layout you need to get the most for your money.<br /><br />It's a free game and there should be more ways to get free gems and I don't mean 1, 2, or 3. What about giving them out in fives or tens?<br /><br />Still the game is fun, but please don't let me have to download another game for free gems. I feel like. I should have gotten a 1,000 for that. These games take up a lot of memory and they're killing my battery.Have a Heart!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What more need I say?  The movie seems to depart from the book in places and there's more deviation on the way, but as with the Trilogy, it's all good.
B0034G4P26|3.0|Most of what goes on in this animation will be lost on kids. The animation is not top shelf, so if you're looking for a Pixar quality movie, you'll be disappointed. Funny at times but can get a little tedious to watch.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I know several depressive, wonderful, people and thought this book did a great job portraying the struggles they face in their daily life.  I also saw the movie but the book was much better.
B008KEQMDC|1.0|I like rom coms and silly movies, especially the ones in which J. Lo and Jennifer Aniston always seem to be playing the same role over and over again with just different backdrops and scenarios. However, What to Expect When You're Expecting (WTEWYE) is a boring movie, about boring people having to make boring decisions. Some audiences have argued that for parents or soon-to-be-parents this was exciting and interesting and relatable. I guess being pregnant or a parent must be really boring then, because that's exactly what this movie was: a star studded cast of lollipops trapped in a borefest without any substance.<br /><br />All the actors are severely underutilized because let's face it, it is impossible to squeeze in character development and plot of 12 couples into something under 2 hours. Most of the women don't even look pregnant, they look like they were holding a basket ball under their shirts.<br /><br />Watching this movie would be like being the fly on your next door neighbor's wall who are expecting a baby. It is as exciting and intriguing.  Nothing but a bunch of mundane, every-day, seriously boring plot lines - and I am using the term \\"plot\\" loosely, as clearly this movie doesn't even have a plot -  with \\"characters\\" that are uninspiring and boring. Really, come to think of it, I think this is one of the most boring movies I have seen and I have a high boredom tolerance.<br /><br />This movie was made to sell by employing a bunch of A lister hotties and pretty boys. Even though the theme of pregnancy is new, I am pretty sure I have seen a movie like this before. I think they have a placeholder or boilerplate for this type of movie in Hollywood and every now and then they take out the script, dust if off, make it conform to contemporary culture, cast with a horde of A- listers and hit go.<br /><br />Just replace every character there with someone like Jennifer Aniston, Katherine Heigl, Leslie Mann, a couple of hunky, up-and-coming Hollywood hunks like Liam Hemsworth, or Chris Pine or a main cast from a prime time TV shows like Andrew Lincoln or something and it would be the exact same movie. So, if you enjoy being bored out of your gore, I say go for it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I'm very pleased with this app. I/F is clean, attractive, and easy-to-use. Even has some scientific functions. Love the percent/tip feature.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The only game I can play before bed or whenN I want to relax. Great fun without promoting teeth gnashing.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Not a big fan of shot 'em up action, but this actually did have a decent story line and crossed over the boundaries of action and sci-fi. Some language in this movie and probably is not a great movie for really young kids. Overall a movie that you could watch a couple of times and still enjoy.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Kept finding excuses to come back and read. Loved the story twists, characters. Recommended to three friends, who also loved it.
B000VQQJ8U|1.0|I bought this Blu because I liked the movie, but this Blu looks awful! It was so bad I turned it off and sold it to someone for $1! They need to redo this one, sucks the movie was treated this way.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I would never have read this book on my own because after The Red Fern Grows in 7th grade I was done with dog novels. My book club picked it so i had to! This was a sweet story of life from the perspective of the dog, Enzo. It was a quick read but said a lot about the &#34;race!&#34;
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Kind of like the old X Files gimmick of hinting at deeper mysteries without ever actually getting to an explanation or connection.  Sort of like real life only when I'm looking for entertainment, I prefer complete tales.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Rocky rip-off that actually is fun to watch. You start out disliking Hugh Jackman's character cause he's such a putz. The kid is irritating and chick is caught with her heart exposed. In the end it all comes together in a very dysfunctional way that makes you feel for each one of the characters. The CGI of the robots is really amazing and the mix of real and CGI is very well done.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A superbly written story.  You know these characters so well that the sadness in this book breaks your heart.  I know I learn what happened just a few years ago better from this book than the newscasts.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|I liked it, a lot.  I'm no musical genius but I gotta say, its just brilliant four more words required.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|Such big names in this film,what a disappointment. Russell Crowe plays the corrupt mayor of New York City, his wife, Catherine Zeta Jones, plays well not much. Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-cop turned Private Detective after leaving the force because the Mayor helped him out of a jam.<br /><br />Lots of violence, guns, harsh words, drinking, either The Mayor or Whalberg are always downing the whiskey. The mayor hires Whalberg to find out who his wife is having an affair with. But that is just the beginning of this con game. Not all or much is what it seems and Whalberg finally figures it out.<br /><br />What kept me interested in this film was trying to figure out if Russell Crowe was wearing a wig. Yes, a partial wig, pretty good one, but not good enough. The wig looked silly on Crowe, not natural. Other than that, the plot has been seen thousands of times, different actors,,different places. But, this one only kept my interest for a short period of time.<br /><br />Not Really Recommended.  prisrob 05-09-13
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Very well done.  Excellent plot, production and animation.  How much more can I say about a story that features a tiger and a boy on a lifeboat?
B00AEBB8PQ|3.0|This would be nice for young kids. Interesting casting for the movie, never really thought of Robert DeNiro as a gay swashbuckler. It had it's moments but overall not a must have type movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not a disappointment. Beware, this book will consume your every waking minute. I never saw the Hunger Games movie, nor do I want to, the books are great.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|A really great book I think every one would read it it was worth the money perferct to good to describe
B001LIBRL6|4.0|Picture a nebbishy Woody Allen channeling the cool, dangerous Humphery Bogart while trying to find a new love interest.  In other words, a humorous Woody Allen setup for insights into the value of just being yourself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story and acting in this series is superb.  Who set up this requirement for minimum words for a review?
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Given the subject and how many movies have depicted it, this one stands out as the most intense. It really gives you insight into the cruelty of the people and how hard their hearts were and how threatened they were by a humble man (not much has changed). Very compelling movie.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|I totally agree with some of the reviewers for the music. Hip hop was not around in the 1920's. They just ruined the film
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Well written book, which I enjoyed and while I understand the situation in N.Korea I still found it very frustrating to read of their brain washed attitude...well maybe it's me that's brain washed?
B0036G8IQS|5.0|i have a kid who is dyslexic and adhd.  this is the book that changed his attitude about reading.  now he asks to go to the library so he can learn and READ about greek mythology!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a must for anyone who loves one player games and this is one of the best.  Simply awesome.
B00770KR7W|4.0|This is my 1st macfarlane, and yes i have nothing to compare, but i also have nothing to complaint!! this figure is just as good as i want. The downside for me (i am not complaint it anyway) is limited articulation at his head and hip.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am glad I didn't let any of the negative reviews discourage me from buying and reading the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I thought it had a satisfying ending.  It ended just as I always suspected it would.  It was nice to see most of the characters make a final appearance and have their story lines tidied up.  The book WAS written differently than the other novels in the series..more moving back and forth between different characters and picking up their story lines at different times but I did not feel that detracted from the reading experience.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Chances are if you're here, you've already been exposed to the antics of Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and the rest of the gang. Well, this series closer gives you exactly what you'd come to expect, filled with drama, action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, as well as some romance; but heres the real kicker--it gives you so much more. It's EPIC. I was concerned that this book (being the last once) wouldn't live up to its predecessors, but without giving anything away, Rick Riordan does an amazing job closing this series out, and leaves you feeling thrilled from cover to cover. I honestly never wanted to put this book down, and once I got to the ending I was not in the least bit disappointed (unlike some other series...any Lost fans in the house?). If you've stuck with Percy this far, it would be a crime to not pick this book up. You won't regret it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great period piece! You find yourself loving some characters and loathing others. Itis an interesting look into the<br />Ives of the wealthy and the rules that governed their lives.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The most lifechanging dimension of love is when we go out of our comfort zones and give in the way our loved one NEEDS the love NOT in the way we are most comfortable giving. This explanation of people and to try to understand our spouse's needs is a whole lot simpler then a book like &#34;Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus&#34; . THough giving praise is not easy for me to do, it is what my husband needs, so now I keep that in mind. Life is so much better living in a peacefilled loving household. Mother Theresa of Calcutta said that sometimes love hurts- sometimes its a challenge to give the way the other person NEEDS the love rather then the way I am most comfortable giving- but the reward is higher and deeper.
B00866H7SS|5.0|OK, so this is a good read, a great read in fact.  Very compelling, more action and a sassier, more interesting heroine altogether in my view.  This is every bit as readable as 50 shades, and to get down to detail, Sylvia Day writes some simply atomic sex scenes.<br /><br />Having said that, Christian grey will somehow stay in our memories longer.  He has more signature features, like the tie and the helicopter.  He seems genuinely a nicer guy than Gideon Cross, who although undeniably hot, is too much of a spoilt child.  Christian would be too perfect if it weren't for his obsession with S&M, but that's fine.  But I preferred Christian to Gideon Cross.  He's more decent, more human.<br /><br />I preferred Eva to Ana for sure.  Ana was too wet, and too unbelievable as a virgin.  Her angle, her twist is that she's inexperienced, and i didn't find her believable.<br /><br />One of the main comparisons of the two is constant sexual tension (50Shades) vs molten hot sex scenes (BTY).  I don't know how EL James does it, but there is a a ton of sexual tension, even when nothing is \\"going on\\".  It is genuinely erotic.  Perhaps it's because the book focuses so relentlessly on the two of them.<br /><br />Sylvia Day by contrast is an unbelievable writer of sex scenes and packs a bigger punch of raw passion and desire.<br /><br />The smart repartee/emails of 50 Shades has no counterpart in BTY.<br /><br />At the end, these two series of books are both fantastic, and far above the standard of most books in this genre, a lot of which is hastily written romance with steamy scenes added.<br /><br />Also good are Miranda Mailer [[ASIN:B00CKUSCS0 Never Understand Part One ( Johnthen Trent Erotic Romance 1)]], and J Kenner [[ASIN:B00AN549PY Release Me (Book 1: Stark Trilogy)]].
B0030HW26K|5.0|Great New York gangster movie. True story. The only problem was the stuttering of the action when played via Amazon Prime app on PS3. I hear they're gonna fix it soon.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|GAVE THIS TO THREE DIFFERENT FRIENDS, FROM THREE DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE, AND<br />AGE GROUPS.  EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST YET.  I CAUGHT THE LIVE TAPING<br />FROM POSITANO, AND THOUGHT IT WAS INDEED, PASSIONATE AND FABULOUS.
B006PTNQGU|4.0|The tech in the movie is a little old, but the story is good! What kid doesn't dream of being rich? Cute story with the moral of what truly makes one rich.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This is a very good, intelligent, and realistic crime drama.  And, yes, it is very graphic, which reflects the realism of the subject matter.  Just the same, the intelligence of the writing, and the excellent performances by the actors, more than compensate for the realistic graphic nature of this series.  Let's just hope NBC can handle such an intelligent series in their lineup this time, as we all know they have a very bad record when it comes to not cancelling intelligent programming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game it's just very hard to get the Chinese idols because they put it in places you can't get to. They should really make the Chinese idols to get easier so if they do some construction work on this game then I'm in on it!!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|As a old Star Trek watcher I thought this new movie was great.  A fresh look on how the cast started and how Capt Kirk became a Starship commander.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|A classic Romeo and Juliet story made for today's kids.  I think all teenagers should be required to watch this!
B00CBRI9G2|5.0|I really enjoyed the film as I really admire  Malick's work and aesethetic in film. This film is more accessable and less ponderous than &#34;Tree of Life&#34; as romantic love is the predominent theme, not the orgin of life and the universe and how we evolved and fit into th world. A must see.
B00CHILW64|3.0|This movie is pretty predictable, having only a couple shades of emotion: desperately looking for each other, and then the joy of finding each other at the end. The best part of the movie was the tsunami scene, which was done very well, showing the tumult that happens beneath the surface of the water and how damaging that is.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this on the computer and enjoyed it, so now it is on my Kindle and I enjoy it even more.
B001OL4TR4|4.0|This quirky, fantastical story is on my short list of incredibly cheesy movies that I absolutely love to watch!  Matthew Broderick showedhe same type of boyish charm and sweet idiocy when he did in Ferris Bueller.I always enjoy waching him.  And I loved Michelle's haircut!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres and loved it then and love it now! Plus in HD the picture was very good!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This is one of the best remote control app in mobile phone I am ever use.  Submit Remote Desktop and VNC.  Very solid and easy to setup and use.  The most important thing it is supporting SSH pass through.  Very secure.  The only drawback is for the VNC, it only support VNC password (not supporting windows authentication).  So bad so I need my VNC client to install on my mobile as well.  Hope they can improve in next version.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Somehow I had missed this movie when in theaters.  A friend recommended it, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Strictly a chick flick tho.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|as far as this game goes, I don't understand it. So I am not that happy with the game, but it is ok, I guess.
B002ZG980A|4.0|Guessed it would be good and it was, just the Jim Carrey you've always loved and Ewenn McGregor was great in it also. A must see!
B004LROUNG|5.0|What can I say about this author . He is great never a dull moment in his books . Hard to put down without finishing it.
B0094K20FK|4.0|This is the best of all the Star Trek movies.  I have to admit that I had always seen Ricardo Montalban as a bit of a clownish character over-actor, but he stole the movie in this role.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very high quality production. If you like puzzles with some mystery and quiet contemplation - somewhat Myst-like - then Don't hesitate! You will definitely get you money's worth. Avoid the using the hints, if you can!! :)<br /><br />Hope they come out with another sooner rather then later!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is one of my favorite artists and when I heard him sing a few of the songs on TV while promoting the album, I just had to get it. I love it, and it also calms down my pets during thunderstorms.
B009NY43NY|1.0|About the plot:<br />This book felt like several betrayals all wrapped into about three hundred pages. First was the handling of Eric, who had been for all intents and purposes the pretty bait used to hook the readers into devouring the previous twelve books. Suddenly, he went from a complicated, terrifying character to a petty tyrant with no depth and little explanation for the change in him. Now I feel used, he was the lure to spend money after the writing started to go downhill from book 4. The second betrayal was from Sookie herself. She was a lesson in character growth, pulling herself up by her pretty southern bootstraps. This book flushed it all down the toilet. In the end, she settled for exactly where she started, choosing the man who had, for 11 1/2 books, been nothing but a plot device whose only interesting quality was questionable judgement that led him to sleep with women who tried to kill Sookie. Sookie's \\"HEA\\" grated against everything she had been striving for. This leads to the last betrayal, Sookie and Eric's relationship. In true Sookie fashion, her and Bill's relationship ending had her agonizing over several books. In Dead Ever After, we get about 300 pages to end the relationship, grieve, and move on to the least developed character available. It was a cheap cop-out. There was no depth and no believability. I could have swallowed the Sam and Sookie ending if they had more development.<br />About the writing:<br />Overall, the writing was poorly executed and felt disjointed to those who have enjoyed this series. (Ex. odd nicknames suddenly popping up) There was a lot of character changes with very little development. If you haven't read it, don't waste your money.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|As always the good Doctor takes us on many splendid adventures! I love watching Dr. Who with my kids because it really has them curious about science and what is possible. Thank you Dr. Who!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Loved this movie!  Finally a current film that is actually a 10!  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were incredible the way they played off each other.  Then there were dynamic scenes between Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver.  Robert DeNiro is hilarious with impeccable comic timing to some serious situations. Great writing, storytelling, characters and acting.  Even Julia Stiles has a tiny part in all of it.  Jennifer Lawrence was ferociously intense.  Definite thumbs up!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Good acting decent story line and lots of things explodes. If you like these things and super heroes you'll like this movie
B005KXT58U|5.0|I have two Evanescence albums, and really wanted to get this one. I got a gift card from my friend and treated myself to this album. Haven't gotten the chance to listen to it yet, but definitely looking forward to it.
193700788X|1.0|Can I give zero stars?<br /><br />Sookie was so far OOC I didn't recognize her. She looked upon all her friends and even Jason with such contempt it made me uncomfortable to read. The first half of the book didn't match the style or tone of the rest of the series. This improved with the second half, but by then I was just bored with it all. The changes in POV were a bit odd. Particularly jarring was the scene at Sookie's house when she wasn't there. That POV change wasn't even necessary.<br /><br />A lot of scenes and details weren't needed for the narration and pulled me out of the story. I'm still not sure I understand why the antagonists were after Sookie in the first place, other than they didn't like her. Did they have a motive?<br /><br />Sadly, this series finale had so much potential, but ended up being a lackluster read that was torture to finish. In fact, the only reason I finished it rather than stopping halfway through was out of a sense of loyalty to Sookie and the series I had invested so much of my time and money in. And that makes ME sad.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works exceedlingly well in my tablet.  Recomend you buy this one.  This is a twisted form of solitaire that is attention holding and time consuming.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play this game with a friend who has an Android phone and we have so much fun. You draw a picture and then they try to guess is as soon as possible to get points. Then they draw and you guess. Just pure fun.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Didn't work for you need an HP that has eprint and mine doesn't so I uninstalled it.  Printing from the kindle isn't easy
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch to wear on weekend when i am working around the house.  I love the look and the fact that i do not have to change the batteries.  As for time keeping, i have not seen notice any lose or gain.  Now with that said, i might not be the best judge.  I wear this constantly from Friday when i wake up till mass on Sunday.  I will usually change back into it after mass and wear it till i go to bed.  during the week it is relegated to the dresser.  It will usually start to slow around Wednesday.  The face is easy to read and the separate min and hour number give it a cool look.  I find the band comfortable and with numerous holes you can find the right spot.  There are 2 metal loop that will hold the band in place.  1 band is stationary about 3/8\\" from the buckle with the other move along the band to hold the end down.  The band itself has a color matched leather strip to support the holes.
B0013ND36G|1.0|T3 is a completely boring and weirdly casted movie i hated claire danes role and nich stahl portrayal of john was not only disappointing but in no was better or even remotely believable since his version of john connor its a dude with no hacking skills at all and he looks like someone out of a rehab center in all honesty terminator salvation is one hundred thousand times better than this junkyard of a movie which not only i hate but just completely discard it from my collection. The picture quality in this bluray copy is standard at best not that impressive and the audio quality is just has bad has the dvd quality or worse so in my opinion not worth the money. The only good thing in this movie is Arnold Schwarzenegger and sadly enough he is not like the way we loved him to be at like he was at T2.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|It's a nice story, but predictable. The message could have been expressed in a more direct manner. Less is much more effective.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Watching this program one can not help but get drawn up into the story of the Crawley family. Top-notch show.:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book captivated my attention.  The plot was constantly changing.  I hope the author writes a sequel.  We read it for our book club and had a great discussion.
B0030BOCKK|4.0|The first time i heard this album i was like &#34;what the hell this isn't a him album&#34; However has i continually kept listening the album it was made perfectly clear this was him just a different side of him. I believe Him Screamworks was the result of the band been pushed to change there style in order to draw in the younger crowds that like pop and that sort of music however this album shows that they were trying something new something experimental. And even though it may not be Hims best is definitely not bad either is just different. In conclusion i believe that Him departure from Sire Records was because the band itself felt like the record company wanted them to change there identity and somewhere along the way him sort of lost his way. Thats why their 8th album Tears on Tape is so important because its the return of one of the greatest bands out there. And this Album Screamworks although not the HIM we expected it it was still nice to see a different side to the bands music and is a definitive must buy for any fan.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie eventhough I had little knowledge of past Star Treks. You don't have to since it's a fresh start on the series.
B008602KQI|4.0|I haven't read the book, so can't make a comparison to it.  Only drawback is what I consider a lack of righteous indignation and anger at the oppressive government that celebrates this yearly slaughter.  The ending was an obvious setup to a sequel.  However, the humanity of the oppressed was good to see, given the sleeziness of so much of today's entertainment, I.e.:reality TV, unfettered sexuality,  and movie violence with no redeeming qualities.  I very much like this movie.
B008K9UZY4|1.0|i have attempted multiple times to install this item on my Kindle and it never works. it is too big to install. what a crock.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Dumped it right away (after the too long, forced tutorial).  I guess that this bird thing is wearing out.  The funny part is that we have several large Angry Birds costumes at our house.  Our neighbor made them and we use them as pillows, etc.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an ending to such a great story. EL James is such an amazing writer. You will thoroughly enjoy this book. Ana's love finally frees Christian , it's beautiful. You will truly love this story. I can't say enough about it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a decent ending to the series, but I only wish the ending was more concrete and to the point. Other than that I enjoyed the book.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Very silly movie, some funny parts, but watching a movie about a midlife couple arguing the entire duration of the movie gets very, very, boring.  No plot to speak of, no point made, nothing to hold viewers interest, no drama, some comedy but again very repetitive.  If you are totally bored and absolutely nothing else to do or watch go for it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Well done and very interesting as a story -pleasant to watch and think about! not what I would suggest for escapist entertainment though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my all time favorite book, it is the turning point in the entire story. You will fall in love with these characters , I recommend the trilogy to everyone I know. You'll really enjoy reading such a great story.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I learned about France's involvment in transporting thousands of Jewish families that were arrested in Paris and transported to Auschwitz. It's not something I learned in school!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is beyond words, it blew my mind and twisted my nerves but I absolutely loved the many challenges and depth of interest it holds.  The graphics are equally awesome.  Best game EVER!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am reading God's word one day at a time. I'll be all the way through it in one year. I selected the version that works for me. I can also look up any other verses that I want which is great for my Bible study time.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm not sure where to begin to describe my utter disappointment.... I guess first would be I wish Ms. Harris would've stopped with book eight.  I love the first eight so much.  I was so hooked and I loved every word.  After book eight I felt that the writing and story line dropped off.  Just pushing out books to fullfil a contract.<br />This book Dead Ever After was an epic fail.  I can not believe after building a romance since book four she simply dis regards it.....for SAM!!!  Are you kidding me??  I am so heartbroken that she ended an exceptional character (Sookie) story with a lame love life with her best friend....Ms. Harris should have at least built us up to this.  Maybe by ...I don't know Sookie and Sam showing interest in each other.<br />Save your money people.  Just pretend that it ended a long time ago....insert your own conclusion ..  it will be better than the actual book.  Hopefully the show will steer clear of this plot line!!!
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Download this show, but don't spring for the HD version if you're streaming.  It might have been my connection, but HD quality never quite gets there...  I downloaded season 3 in non-HD and it was exactly the same.  Perhaps it would've been better had I not been streaming.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|It is a good story, but the book is small and one has to get the other books of the series to be able to complete the reading. I recommend it.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|5 stars for the movie. had a nice time watching it. quality was good even though I couldn't watch it on HD in my laptop.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Just hard to watch all together, lame \\"cute\\" dialogue exchanges, not funny at all, and constantly annoying. I would be so upset if I had paid to watch this, don't waste you time.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This CD is wonderful. The variety of music is great and add always, Lindsey Sterling brings her new sound with a great beat.
0062073486|4.0|Without giving away the ending, I venture forth. I had seen the black and white American version of this and it was called Ten Little Indians and if memory serves it ended differently. Having said that I did some digging to see why the name change, and well frankly with today's times, the name change was helpful and in some areas necessary as 10 little Indians is not the original title.<br /><br />Having said that, the book does keep you wondering who the killer is. If you are a mystery fan who likes waiting till the last page to have the mystery solved, then this is the book for you. I also enjoyed that fact that there were just people here, no high self centered or elderly detectives. This my friends is the first murder mystery party!
1616550414|5.0|Zelda: lots of untold information and original unseen concept art, the full color illustrations are beautiful. however, lots of packaging for such a very sturdy book too a while to unearth and it was worth it.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I gave this five stars because it really does what it advertises well. It is a snap to install and both my desktops were recognized instantly.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|so far good read and stays on the page when i go to another novel and come back. It was a good but also because i got all 4 of the first novels for 20% of the cost of the hardcopies i think
B0087ITBPC|3.0|It is just OK, I was very disappointed in this movie. Being a Barbra fan I thought the movie would be awesome like ALL of her others I own. I was not happy with the quality of this movie or the content.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I've seen  each and every 007 movie, more than once.  Good plot, Daniel Craig is good as always.  MORE MORE!
B00005S6K8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Love it so much. This movie I watch over and over again. Great movie!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Like leather cases better than vinyl or cloth. Rotating function is very handy for certain apps. Can rotate so that the charging connector faces out while the case is closed. Automatically turns the screen on/off when the case is opened and closed.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this item on Monday and it arrived 2 days after, the shipping was very fast and the product is as described. I first used it at my work place to charge my phone (galaxy s3) and the charging time was even faster than my Samsung original charger so I decided to order one. The length is great, longer than my charger so I can kind of move the phone around while charging.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Saw the movie first with some friends and the book was highly recommended.  I think most would agree that watching the movie before the book(if you have that opportunity) is the best way to go.  That way you get a deeper insight into the narrative instead of feeling agitated at the parts that had to be cut.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it's an easy and fairly fast read.  I like it and the movie for different reasons.  Not the best book I've ever read, but enjoyable; has some interesting issues and twists.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I love movies that are inspirational and that makes me happy also feel good about myself. This movie provided all that for me.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I think there's a good story line here. It's just hidden by the extreme darkness that doesn't allow you to see a thing scary or not, the poor actors, and the overall horribleness of the movie.  I am a horror movie fanatic and this movie really let me down!  My advice: take the $4 you would spend renting this movie and buy a greaseburger with it - you'll have more fun!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've been using AccuWeather for a few weeks now and I still love it. It installed easily and ran with no problems in my Kindle Fire HD. I entered my home town and it loaded it with no problem, then I put in the town in another country where I'm going on vacation in a few weeks and it's very easy to toggle between the two cities and keep up on what's happening at both places. If you like keeping up with the weather then this is for sure an app you want to have!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|game feels the same as DH3.  so far so good playing.  no bugs as of yet but I have not tried the Multics player.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The relationship between Sookie and Sam had not been developed enough in the previous books to lead to this ending. The whole book felt rushed.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I thought this movie was great. This movie had everything you could want,great actors,great plot, a sense of history.<br />Because of the acting and dialog in this movie, I watched it twice, and I very rarely watch a movie twice.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist was an amazingly moving book. One young man, desperate to find his life's treasure and learn to understand the language of the world moved me very deeply. So many could follow Paulo's words and find joy they have never known in their lives.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this novel!
193700788X|1.0|I haven't even finished this stupid book, and at this point I will only finish it to find out what happens.  I can usually knock out a new book that I have been looking forward to in less than a day, but here it is early Friday morning and I'm only 75% through it.  I find that I just don't really care what happens.  I keep just putting it down while thinking \\"this is dumb...\\"  It seems like she is just cramming in every character we've ever met, just so they can get a last appearance.  And that last appearance is totally pointless!  I am seriously disappointed in this book...and I've been a fan since way before True Blood.  I'm sure I would have read it anyhow, just to see how it all ended, but this book feels like the utter bastardization of a series that I have come to adore.  Which really blows.<br /><br />ETA:  Finished the book.  The end was painful.  Not because I was sad it was over, but because it was just that freaking tedious.  Truly sad ending to a beloved series.  May it rest in peace.  If I had this book in paper form instead of Kindle, it would rest in several hundred pieces.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I love the entire LOTR series as both a novel and a film. This movie is unbelievably amazing an in tune with the creativity and fantasy that was first ignited by Tolkien. And its funny! Overall family friendly but there are a few intensive fight scenes. I cannot wait for the next one!
B003NTSBTC|5.0|Totally Loved this. Would like all seasons on Prime so we could view them at no extra charge! Thank you!
B008VIKLWA|5.0|This movie is beautifully shot and edited, Tim Allen is a little annoying at times... But a great film that shows how much like us chimps can behave...
B004QSQML8|5.0|Wonderful! The Lord of Darkness is one of the coolest bad characters ever. There is a good/bad dichotomy throughout the whole film hinging on the ultimate power, or \\"Father\\" who controls the evil and most likely the good. The unicorn is a symbol f purity. A lot of religious overtones that speak volumes, and I would say a philosophically heavy film if you let it be. Tom Cruise kicks butt as always, but all of the characters are awesome with great costumes/makeup to boot.<br /><br />Sunshine is my destroyer!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a heartwarming, quick read with a disturbing look into the  so called &#34;Christian&#34; orphanages in Ireland.  The fact that they lasted until the 1990's is hard to fathom!
B003730LRY|5.0|Totally Loved this. Would like all seasons on Prime so we could view them at no extra charge! Thank you!
193700788X|1.0|I can not believe this was the ending to a series that I spent years and money reading are you kidding me when I got to the end I was like\\"WHAT THE HELL\\" I am so disappointed it was devastating to read it everything that Sookie and the series was about was just flushed down the toilet.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You read it primarily to see the final resolution of the story. The plot becomes more far-fetched and tiresome with each book. It is nice that some justice seems to prevail in the end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is probably the best book I have read in years. The plot twists and turns. Just when you think you have it figured out, something entirely unexpected happens. Plus it is very well written, so it's a pleasure to read.
1568490119|5.0|I believe that this book is a classic.  I have purchased 3 copies of this book.  I recommend it to everyone.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Sophie is usually one of my favorites but this one was just ok. It had a few laugh out loud moments but that was about it.  If this is your first Sophie Kinsella book I encourage you not to give up after this one as all of her previous books are much better.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy decorating Nemo`s reef.  The colors are wonderful and the music relaxing.  The only downside is the levels &amp; growth of the reef are extremely slow if you do not spend actual money.  Also younger players need help with having the suggestions &amp; text bubbles read to them.  It is a little slow for kids - - - we are using it to try &amp; work on patience with our 5 yr old.  She really likes it!  She also likes visiting each other`s reefs.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Awesome series watched season 1 over three days, can't wait to buy season 2 when it comes out on HD.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Your on the last book of this series. You've endured this far you don't need a review!!! Enjoy some action finally an end to the fluff that made up the majority of some of the books.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's not as much fun as she though it would be. It is okay but not for someone like her.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you are into War History and Science Fiction, you need to buy this book. Amazing writing, easy read. Very entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's beast it's so so cool you get to get huverboard athletic shoes prizes it rock,s your being chased by  a guard. it is just beast.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I think I love this movie almost as much as my 2 1/2 year old grand-daughter. Very cute movie! Buy it.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|This is the perfect CD to tune the world out and write some serious code to. I can't recommend it enough.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books! Suspenseful, erotic, captivating. I couldn't put them down. Loved the story line and the characters. I hope that there will be more like these. I would recommend to anyone over 18, not for young readers because of the sexual content.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I loved this book!!  It is so much better than the play or the movie, although, I enjoyed them as well.  The end of the story is completely different from the play or movie!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Such a heart warming and inspiring movie.  Brad Pitt is great as usual and the little girl who plays his daughter is awesome.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|What can you say.....its a stylus. It doesn't work as well on the screen as expected. I guess I have to get use to using it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works perfectly. Set it and fall asleep to white noise and wake to your exactly set alarm. Easy to use.
B001VFGL4W|5.0|While much more of a Gothic/industrial fan, I've loved this Deftones album for over a decade. Though it has been quite some time, I've recently relistened to it and am still quite moved by the haunting vocals, and entrancing music. This albums is full of really great songs that for me, at least, have withstood the test of time.
B0034G4P4Y|1.0|This film is Spielberg at his best and worst.  Like Speilberg's Catch Me if You Can, Tin Tin's opening title sequence is great but also the best part of the  film.  Spielberg has decided to recycle the cliches from 1930s movie serials he put to work very creatively in Indian Jones (the first one) and draw them ut in bogus 3D sequences that are pure spectacle and add nothing to the plot.  The film is well-crafted, but it is targeted to 12 year olds whose parents are supposed to enjoy, it would appear, watching their kids have their first Spielberg experience.  I am happy my 12 year old son liked it.  I took a nap through most of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book and was worried this one wouldn't be as good. That was unfounded worry.  The ending was kinda sudden, but that just made me download the next book even quicker.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|I ordered this because I could no longer play it on Vinyl (for those who remember that format). Quality, selections, and Janis - Five Stars plus.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Another Band where there's is not a single album or song I don't like. The lyrics are genius the sound is awesome.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|After I saw the deer scene of this movie I was like: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Now where have I seen this b4? Then I remembered the Pokemon X and Y trailer with the scene of showing the legendaries for the game. Yes. Now I recall where I saw this the deer who is named Xernias. There is absolutely no inspiration in Pokemon! I believe this movie was already being finnished and preparing for its theatre announcement b4 ppl knew of X and Y. This is helarious. People are fresh out of ideas! But I love tis movie. My review was in no way attacking this movie but pointing out the lack of creativity in Pokemon. I think their probably watching American movies to get ideas for new Pokemon.
B00BYH6OJO|4.0|WAAAAAY too much foul language, the use of the &#34; F bomb &#34; is way over the top. & I absolutely hate it when they use GOD D _ _ n it...
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I have recommended this book to several of my collegues. I have decided to buy copies for my direct reports.<br /><br />J Jones<br />Executive Director, I.T.
B0013AT2WI|4.0|I downloaded this album almost three months ago.  A few months before that, I would listen to the samples from time to time but delayed making the decision to purchase it because I just wasn't sure if I liked it enough.  After the release of \\"The Next Day\\" album and being absolutely thrilled with it, I went on a Bowie download binge, if you will, and this is one of the albums I chose.<br /><br />The first time I listened to the whole thing, I was confused as to why so many reviewers seem to find so much fault with it.  I will concede it's far from his best recorded vocal performance (he sounds physically tired -- and probably was due to his health at the time), and I will also admit not every song is my cup of tea (not a fan of \\"New Angels of Promise\\" or \\"The Dreamers\\").  But when has EVERY Bowie song on a specific album ever been my cup of tea?  I don't like everything he does, but almost always there is enough or more than enough that I do like to make owning a particular album worthwhile.<br /><br />I still don't understand why he made a ballad the lead song and I'm not quite sure how it fits with the remaining tracks, but if anything, it's worth purchasing for the remixes, as they may one day become rarities/collectibles.  If you're into building upon your already-existing Bowie collection and you like him when he's \\"toned down\\" a bit, I think you'll find \\"Hours\\" worthwhile. I listen to it now on a regular basis.  I have come to really like this album.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I bought this to help me conveniently run my videogame campain page called Fortune Street for Wii U/3DS it has been helpful for my status updates and not having to switch profiles. But sadly I could use more likes to proove my point to the makers Square Enix and Nintendo! I only have 5. So if u want to after you read this review you could like my page.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Cute animation but not a lot of staying power for me as an adult who likes word games. Maybe better for kids?
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|I have had 3 days to listen to this new album.  In my opinion guitar instrumentals are not the type of shallow music that you can hear a few times and fully grasp.  After having time to absorb before posting a review, I have found the melodies are great.  Now I am starting to hear the small details within those melodies.  This is a great new album.  Even my wife likes it and she could care less about this type of music.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Incredible! Never heard of them until Saturday Night Live on May 4th (I'm living under<br /> a rock) they were amazing that's why I had to buy their music.  See you in Indianapolis on May 30th. Rock on Iceland
B00186LO1E|5.0|I love this movie! I was told by my dad tons of times for a year at least to see this movie and since I convinced myself in my head theres no way it can b bad! So I bought it without renting it or seeing it in theatres. I kno ppl say u can't judge a book by its cover but when I see a trailer I just have a gut feeling I either kno already tgat its either gonna suck or rock! It's a gift too kno b4 hand about the value of a movie!
B000IDCJK8|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Unfortunately it was never given the HD treatment it deserves. I'm sure a cleaner print could be found and enhanced. I would have paid more for a better quality transfer; not necessarily Bluray, just a DVD. However it was fairly cheap in price.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|My favorite adaptation of this movie. The actors in major and minor parts were outstanding. Expect to be drawn into the story emotionally from the beginning through the end.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl's story is indeed riveting I itself,but what makes it even more so is her writing style which is captivating and compelling!
B00BT0ZDF2|3.0|Good Movie acting was great makeup was not so great.  Enjoyed the stories but maybe too long not sure though, may have been needed to develop the characters be sure you have half the day to watch a movie.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|I thought this movie was a bit underrated. I enjoyed it way more than the A team.  Its just an all around good movie. Glad its in my blu ray collection
B004SEUJBE|4.0|Haven't watched it, but have heard strong reviews from friends and neighbors.  Purchased as a gift.  Can't wait to see it....
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A perfectly written story about the few people who saw a collapse of monumental proportions coming and had the balls to bet on it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It has been great to have this app on my phone!  It is so nice to have the books I am reading and my Bible with me all the time! So so very handy!!
B0085A9HXS|5.0|I could care less about the story in this movie... I wanted an amazing action movie and thats just what I got.  The fight scenes are incredible!  Highly recommended.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My friend recommended. It is very entertaining and easy to play. It is fun building your own reef and completing goals.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|More Channels Needed.<br /><br />Did not like.<br />Lack of channels that were not of religeious in nature would be of more interest to most people.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Another spectacular movie from Tarantino. Full of action along with a great plot and intriguing characters. This movie will not disappoint and will keep on surprising you till the end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Truly a Masterful Masterpiece! Just look at the thousands of 4 and 5 star reviews. My comments would be simply redundant.
B00333NCTM|3.0|This is so not my regular reading fare.  I am not a heavy metal fan.  I am not an Ozzy Osbourne fan--I don't dislike him; he's just not on my radar.  I can't name a single one of his songs, let along hum any of them.  In fact, I only knew two things about Ozzy when I started this book.  He had a show called \\"The Osbournes\\" and he once bit the head off a bat.  And that's why I read this book.  I knew he had a...er...colorful history but I had no idea how colorful it really was.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have found this book both easy to follow and very motivational. I have started the diet and like how I feel physically and also just like the discipline of fasting. If you are going to give this diet a try this book would definitely be helpful!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|The movie was good.  I think they used the wrong actor to play Reacher.  Tom Cruise is a good actor, but he does not carry off the Jack Reacher image.  He is too short and he would look tiny in comparison to the 6 ft 5 in, 250 lb Reacher.  Cruise is not, shall we say MAN the was Reacher is.  But, all in all it was a good movie and I would recommend it to my friends
B009NY43NY|2.0|I mostly agree with all the negatives reviews.<br />The least one can say is that there is no real story. Charlaine Harris could have easily add the end she wanted for Sookie in the previous book. 50 pages would have done it.<br /><br />Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.<br /><br />However, I always felt this was the only possible ending. I think it was what Charlaine Harris wanted.<br />Obviously there is this idea of Sookie growing up into adulthood. Vampires are usually a way to symbolize the changes, conflicted desires etc. of teenage years. Letting this world behind means being ready to be an adult.<br />She needed someone whith whom she could live with, have a child with and become old. It is not possible if you choose death over life. Motherhood is also evidently seen as redemption in CH work.<br />So there was no other choice that her best friend.<br /><br />PS : sorry for my poor english
B006X08FDA|5.0|The song &#34;Leaving Eden&#34; is a must-hear. Rhiannon sings Laurelyn Dossett's song beautifully. If you like string bands, this is a must-have album.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|All aspects of the show are well produced. The characters are believable and various plots within the main setting is excellent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|excellent app. many options to fit your exact needs. one day. every other day, or custom days. able to pick your own wake up sounds on kindle is a deinite must.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|So much different than we expected.  Wonderful photography and story line which enthralled me from the start.  HD viewing was definitely an asset.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Really love this game, which is simple to play, difficult to master, and my favorite . . . cheap. You would think there is only so much you could do with a candy hanging from a rope, but they did a great job of incorporating a lot of interesting puzzles with it. Getting 3 stars can get really tricky. Highly Recommend.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Only reason I did not rate it five star is first season set the bar pretty high. Still such rich production and love the way scenes end and transition between multiple story lines. Brings deceit and back stabbing to new level. Great balance of so many sub-plots that are tied together just enough to make you feel like you have a view of such a tremendous, complex world. Never know what to expect with main characters meeting their demise when totally unexpected. Love a story were you can never take things for granted and I am taken to a place I did not expect. The surprises are shocking for one that can usual predict the next move.
B002APU580|5.0|Kierra Knightly and the rest of the cast exude all the elements that make the book so entrapping.  Their portrayals of the Bennetts, Bingleys and of course cold Mr. Darcy are so well executed that rereading the book I hear their voices.
B0014KFM2Q|5.0|Great Bruce Springsteen old school music.  If you grew up with the Boss, and you haven't bought this album, you need to get it and enjoy it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've read all of the books in the series, but this one was easily one of my favorites. Sanderson did an excellent job pulling everything together. The pace is very fast throughout its entirety and I found myself having to read &#34;just one more chapter&#34; before bed each night. There could have been a bit more Mat in this book as he is easily my fav, but it was great none-the-less. Brandon Sanderson did a good job of capturing his snarkiness too, which was a concern of mine. Ultimately, it answered a great deal of questions and tied everything up nicely.
B008Q0CE50|5.0|Great film. She is Elizabeth! Cate Blanchette gives one of her finest performances. She is Elizabeth! This is a must see. I've added to my library.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Several times while watching this with my spouse we were like...this is so us. VERY FUNNY! A must see !
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books are hands down the best books I have ever read. George R. R. Martin really knows how to hook you!
B009G41CG2|5.0|This game in all versions are great for taking up one's time at puzzle figuring. Never enough time to do all of theem.
B0013TPVGK|5.0|I previously read this on paperback and wanted to reread it but couldn't find my copy of the book anywhere so I downloaded the audible version. It was just as good the second time around.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I watched this show because of the refrences on Big Bang Theory. Loved it! It was unique and fun. Loved the characters.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Awesome graphics. My kids are 2 and 5 and really enjoy playing this game. Easy to understand for my 5 yr old.
B009AP2G26|4.0|Most of the episodes are good.Great music and storyline.Some you were waiting for the ending and were left wanting more.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Unfortunate man who had a terrible childhood in an orphanage, but finds family in the end. This is a quick read.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book is fantastic and intense. At times it is hard to read because her emotions are so raw and real. I really felt her pain. She takes you thru her extremely difficult divorce with guilt, anxiety and inner turmoil. She is a complete mess, but is able to find her inner strength and pull herself thru. She goes to Italy to discover food and a way to enjoy life, India to discover faith and her inner strength, and Bali to become centered, where she discovers friends and more. Her journey is touching and really makes you think. It's almost like you are going thru it with her.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|All of the characters are well developed and interesting.  The lead, Patrick Jane, is a complex character full of remorse, pain, yet tender with a developed sense of justice and fairness. As an ex[con man, his shady past gives him an ability to &#34;read&#34; people which is fascinating but with a lot of humor humor as well. The antagonist ,&#34;Red John&#34;, continues to be mysterious and elusive compelling us to keep watching.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|I'm happy to have seen the movie, and the leading characters are very good.<br />As an adaptation of the novels it falls short.<br />Unlike the Swedish film trilogy, which I've watched several times, this is a movie I'll only watch once.
