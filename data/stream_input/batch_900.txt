B0012Q732O|3.0|I ordered this DVD before I read any of the reviews here.  I hadn't watched the DVD until after I read several reviews, so, when I did watch it today, I didn't expect much at all.  And, in the beginning, I thought I was going to be right.  However, little by little, the plot began picking up, the acting was a bit better, and the action began moving.  As the film finished (I never give away endings!), I thought, slow-moving, but still a good watch!  I didn't feel like I had wasted 1.5-2 hours; instead, I felt lifted and wanting just a little to cheer with everyone on the screen.<br /><br />So, what I guess I am trying to say is that:<br />If you are looking for blood and gore; if you are looking for sex; if you are looking for violence that blasts off the screen; then, pass this one up.<br />But, if you are looking for a short, epic film; if you are looking for love and determination; if you are wanting suspense and action; then, try this one.  I don't think you will feel let down.
0143034901|1.0|I picked up this book at the bookstore (I wish I hadn't wasted my money), as I was looking through it this lady approaches me and tells me it's great, I should read it and so on. I was hesitant for some reason even though the cover is very cool, the praise from so many other authors/book critics and the description on the back. So I bought it. Ironically the first 30 pages of the book are entertaining, although I quickly learn that the author has no clue with regards to love.<br /><br />I keep reading, waiting and waiting for Zafon to get somewhere, get to a sub-plot or closer to the plot, instead he goes off on some political nonsense. The guy that gets raped, how is that relevant to the story and it doesn't fit the theme of the book. He brings in Stalin. There is so much irrelevant stuff from dialogue to characters that has nothing to do with the story. The characters are so black and white (figuratively), there is no gray, they are one-dimensional, they are either good or bad, all this sentimental crap--I stopped reading at about page 170. I should finish but I don't care, I don't care what happens. If somebody wants to tell me what happens, please do. I have no patience for this so called story.<br /><br />It's like a bad movie but I can't fast forward.<br /><br />I also can't believe that Zafon has been compared to Eco, or Reverte. I don't think so. Zafon must have some connections in the publishing world. Good for him.<br /><br />Also the people that have given this book 5 stars, shocking, is this the first book you've ever read? Pathetic.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I saw \\"Wall-E\\" some years ago on an airplane flight, and it caught my attention from the beginning.  Pixar managed to tell a story where there is virtually no dialogue in the first half of the movie, and only 2 characters.  Three, if you count the cockroach.  And, yet, it works beautifully, like a modern CGI silent movie.  The dialogue begins once the movie reaches about the halfway point, and we enter the _Axiom_.  The artwork and direction is outstanding, and the story held my interest.  The environmental thing is a little annoying, but living in the Bay Area,  I'm somewhat inured to green-y hectoring as background noise, so I just filter a lot of that out.  Plus, how can you not love any movie that has a \\"Rogue Robots!\\" alert in it?<br /><br />My 2 year old didn't enjoy it as much as me.  She didn't hate it; she was simply bored by the first part of the movie due to the lack of dialogue.  Unlike \\"Nemo,\\" where she ran around for days afterward demanding to see \\"Nemo, Nemo, Nemo!\\" over and over again, I didn't hear \\"Wall-E\\" or \\"Eva\\" at all after the movie was over.  \\"Wall-E\\" isn't inappropriate for a 2 year old by any means, but may be just a little over their heads.  It's great for adults, but you may want to wait until your kids are 4-5 if you want them to enjoy this.
B00260HH3K|1.0|First and foremost, I will try to make this review as unbiased as I can, but that is pretty hard considering the debacle that hopefully cost Fox as much money as possible and squelch any rumblings of a horrific sequel.    Ok, as the immortal Steve Martin said in \\"The Jerk,\\" \\"Roll the ugliness.\\"    Acting - Cheesy one liners from a soap opera are what come to mind.  Think Twilight mixed with all those shows you see about fake high school life and the dialogue is that.      Plot - With the will to be unbiased (DB fans needs not apply, goku got bent over and...well you know) the plot has some significant holes.  Goku, known as \\"Ozaru\\" somehow came to earth with Piccolo 2,000 years ago.  Yet he is 18 in the movie.  Goku is supposedly the slave/helper/\\"buddy\\" of Piccolo and after 2,000 years can resist him with the best of them.    Special Effects - Um, hello?  Forgive the Dane Cook moment, but I literally laughed out loud when I saw the climatic battle.  I could make better battles and effects in flash and I am horrible at flash!      I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, much less have some poor sap shell out hard earned money for this crap.      I always try to find at least one good thing about every movie I have ever seen and believe it or not, I have one about this movie.  The good thing about this movie is that I saw a bootlegged copy and didn't have to waste any money on this horrible attempt at a dragon ball movie.  I seriously hope this is the last we hear of this particular abomination of an attempt at a live action Dragon Ball movie.  I do hope some other studio takes on the task of creating a somewhat decent recreation of the beloved by millions anime.
B0026OE2O8|4.0|If you want a new and thought-provoking nature documentary, check out \\"Earth.\\" The documentary is a biography of Earth and man's relationship with it. It covers wildlife, farmland, and urban slums to show how we have changed so much of the Earth's surface.     The footage is in HD quality and absolutely stunning. The film uses mostly aerial shots, which works really well. From hundreds of feet above, the camera captures the vast scale of human change to the planet. I saw things that I had always heard about, such as shrimp aquaculture, but never grasped how huge and destructive the practice could be until seeing a shrimp farm from above. Likewise, seeing the rows upon rows of McMansion-style houses in Beijing was a scary indicator o what to expect as China continues to grow.    My only problem with the documentary is that it is pretty depressing. The sheer scale of human activity and damage to the environment is numbing. Sadly, it is probably accurate in its doomsaying, but \\"Home\\" may simply leave viewers with a sense of hopelessness rather than a conviction to change our ways.
B00275EGTC|5.0|I think the film that I had most in my mind as I watched MOON was BLADE RUNNER.  MOON didn't have the scale of BLADE RUNNER (nor did it attempt to create any illusion of that scale of production), but it seemed to be a variation on the theme of BLADE RUNNER.  It makes no attempt to repeat BLADE RUNNER, but it suggests an off-world back-story for the replicants in BLADE RUNNER.  And it seemed to have the same major theme: what makes a human a human.    It was refreshing to see a science fiction film about \\"ideas\\" rather than \\"action\\".  More about why something is happening rather than what happens.  Not the MOON is dry and cerebral - there is plenty happening on the screen - but it's there to cause one to reflect on things rather than to be caught up in a rush of action and scenic effects.

1433502402|3.0|Just a suggestion...For those looking for the reformed perspective, I would also suggest the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible. I found the comments more detailed and complete than the RC Sproul-edited ESV RSB and despite disagreements...it think the NIV is a solid \\"translation\\". The only complaint about the Spririt of the Reformation Study Bible is that the text is a little challenging to read for the slightly older folks.
B000099T3P|4.0|After Gremlins came out in 1984 it seemed like copy cat films hit theatres\VHS every few months. Of all the knock-offs, Critters would end up being my favorite. The main draw is the titular, fuzzy balls of munching mayhem, better known as The Krites. They're malevolent space creatures, but I've got a soft spot in my heart for them.<br /><br />Intergalactic, face morphing, bounty hunters have tracked down \\"asteroid prison\\" escapees to the Planet Earth. Said fugitives are The Krites, and they're REALLY hungry. They start off snacking on the local fauna and for the main course they descend upon the Brown family farm. Dee Wallace Stone (Mrs. Brown) must smell like country-fried steak or something...<br /><br />The film systematically evolves into a barricade the house and lock out the creatures affair, but several things prevent it from buying the farm. First and foremost are the gruesome, yet lovable Krites. They're like space porcupines with giant toothy maws, glowing red eyes and insatiable appetites. The Chiodo Brothers (Killer Klowns from Outer Space) were responsible for breathing life into the alien abominations and it's really a joy to see them in action. I just love the \\"special abilities\\" they have in their arsenal. They can roll into a ball for faster movement, grow bigger, shoot poisonous spines and of course, chomp the hell out of everything. Shockingly, they also speak in a garbled language which is hilariously subtitled for any humans watching. The Krites are perfectly realized movie monsters.<br /><br />Critters is a campy \\"B movie\\" in every way. The filmmakers were aware of this and they certainly embraced it. For example, we are constantly shown this ridiculous hair band that sings the rock anthem, \\"Power of the Night\\". Apparently, one the face morphing bounty hunters thought it was so rockin' that he decides to disguise his face as glam rocker, Johnny Steele (who, incidentally, looks like my old college roommate Keith). Speaking of the bounty hunters, they're terribly naive and watching them figure out human technology is often hilarious. They have the diplomacy skills of a trigger happy terrorist and their, \\"We've come for the Krites\\" demands are typically followed with acts of explosive violence (i.e. - them blowing the living crap out of things). Nothing about Critters is subtle and you're going to enjoy the small town pandemonium that ensues.<br /><br />For a PG-13 affair with a low death count, it's still easy for me to recommend Critters. The low budget sci-fi effects have held up surprisingly well and the Krites are nothing short of amazing. If you can stomach the less than stellar acting and rudimentary plot, then you'll find that Critters is one of the better creature features from the 80s. It's far from perfect, but it's great for some laughs. Critters is a dish best served with a group of rowdy friends and some ice cold brews.<br /><br />Final Grade: Band watching them figure out human technology is often hilarious.

B00008WT5E|3.0|I mean Keef Richards, The Rolling Stones' geetar man. This is pretty much the factoid that made me want to buy this album, as otherwise the track listing held no appeal to me at all.  I'm a bigger fan of AC/DC than of The Stones, but his word made taking a punt on this album seem worth it.       To my mind, this is AC/DC at their rawest and most unrelentingly aggressive. The guitars have the sound of angle grinders on this album and have a unity of sound. That's all fine, but the main reason I can't give this album more than 3/5 is the fact that for the first time, perhaps, it lacks the kind of anthemic, iconic or stadium rocking song that the band does better than anyone else.  Normally with an AC/DC album I can give at least one song a big tick, signifying that it is a classic by the band. Can't do that here. So, I'll have to say that this album might be appeal more to people who are into really raw and aggressive guitar music...say fans of raw punk or thrash metal. Lead guitarist Angus Young has said that this album is a bit of a lost classic in his view. I don't see it that way. If you have never heard an AC/DC album you like, then maybe this is the kind of album which you might like.    Here's my thoughts on the tracks, starting with the best one, in my view, which is:    Down payment blues - has a pulsing riff which sounds like it was recorded in a steel water tank or something. Has bass and lead guitar solo-ing. The songwriting is particularly good and has a grungy theme.    Best of the rest:    Sin city - not a bad riff in its favour, and has a very nice bass line in the middle. Lead guitar features as well.    Gone shootin' - has a good psycho riff in its favour (stabbing sound) and the lead guitar work is good.    The rest:    Rock'n'roll damnation - the riff reminds me of Bowie's \\"Jean genie\\" and Foreigner's \\"Hot blooded\\"...there is a line about his temperature in the song.  Sometimes the guitar sounds a bit like a harmonica, if that makes sense. Good drum outro, which is unusual, in that normally the drumming in this band is of the \\"streak and three veg\\" variety.    Gimme a bullet - angle grinder sounding guitars. Bass.    Riff raff - sounds to me if some of the distortion in this song is unintentional...i.e. the studio not being able to capture the sounds the band was making. Lyrically, Bon Scott pounds out the title. Bass.    Kicked in the teeth - has a Led Zeppelin vibe to it, I think. Interesting lead guitar texture in one section.    What's next to the moon - just made a note of this song for mentioning someone called \\"Casey Jones\\", which is  obscure to me. Might have to look them up.    I made no notes on \\"What's next to the moon\\" and \\"Up to my neck in you\\". Nothing much grabbed my attention in them.    This isn't a bad album, it just lacks the kind of killer songs that the band is known for. And the band has never sounded this in your face either.  Basically, I think that this album will either appeal to people who don't like the kind of AC/DC albums I love, or who like raw genres like punk or thrash etc. In one of the sleeve notes to an AC/DC album I've recently bought, it was mentioned that the band was considered punk by the British media. That was news to me. Perhaps the kind of laddish chants you found in songs such as \\"T.N.T\\" brought that judgement out of the music media. In any case, since Powerage was released in the wake of the punk movement which erupted the previous year, perhaps Powerage is sort of AC/DC's punk album. It just lacks the catchy punk riffs that the genre was creating. Over a year earlier, Australian pioneers of punk, The Saints, released \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" which also had egregious raw guitar sounds. Maybe AC/DC took that from their album?    For the ultimate Australian pub rock album, I'd recommend AC/DC's \\"Let there be rock\\". Otherwise, for their best anthemic albums, something like:    Back in black  T.N.T. (still available, new too. \\"High voltage\\" is the international versionof this album)  Dirty deeds done dirt cheap (ideally, you want the Australian version which had \\"Jailbreak\\" on it, a classic)  Razors Edge.    Other genres which may appeal, if you like the rawness of this album:    The Saints: (I'm) Stranded. Australian punk pioneers. Proto thrash/speed punk-metal type tracks.    Slayer: Undisputed attitude. Punk covers by extreme speed metallers. Some classic punk tunes unearthed.    Metallica: Master of puppets. The ultimate thrash metal album, probably.    Nirvana: Nevermind. Has some very hard punk type songs on it.
B002BY77CW|4.0|I wasn't expecting a lot, but I thought that I would give the book a shot since most of the reviews were not that bad. I was pleasantly surprise by the book. It is not the best written book but the story line was definitely entertaining and a nice break from my usual more serious books. I enjoyed the book enough to read the next one that she writes.
0553385461|5.0|This is a short, easy read that gives a brief overview of the major themes found in relativity theory, quantum mechanics, big bang cosmology, and string theory.  Many understandable examples and illustrations are provided to help the reader understand the difficult and lofty ideas that the author attempts to convey.<br /><br />Although it is now common knowledge that the earth is round, it can sometimes be difficult to think of some reasons why this would be true that you could give to a skeptic. The author gives some good observable evidence why one might believe that the earth is round, as opposed to flat. For example, the fact that when the earth is between the moon and the sun, the shape of the earth's shadow on the sun is always a disk. If the earth was a flat disk, we would expect to sometimes see a disk, but other times to see an elongated circle or ellipse. These kinds of little observable phenomena that anyone can see I find interesting.<br /><br />The author should stick to physics as opposed to metaphysics or questions concerning religion. For example, towards the beginning of the book, the author seems to admit that if all can be explained by science, then determinism is true and hence, there is no reason to think that the conclusions we come up with are the correct ones because they have all been determined. However, he tries to get out of this mess by claiming that according to Darwinian evolution, we should have developed higher congnative faculties which are good for knowledge. This is an absurd claim, as not only does it not at all address the question of determinism, but also has been shown by Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism to be seriously flawed.  However, the point of the author discussing this made even less sense to me when he began discussing how things work at the quantum level (can only have a probability distribution for where a particle is at any given time rather than absolute certainty) and how Laplace's idea of determinism has been disproven because of said quantum phenomena.  So that whole discussion at the beginning rather confused me.<br /><br />There were many fascinating things that the author discussed in a way that was easy for a layman to understand and which had \\"real world\\" applications. For example, the author discusses how the further you are from the center of the earth, the less of an impact gravity has on you. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, this also turns out to affect how you understand time so that you and someone much further from the earth's surface experience time differently. A very practical application that the author then mentions is that of GPS systems and how if we did not take general relativity and the time contraction into account when designing the satellites used in GPS navigation, that it would be way noticeably off. Another \\"popular\\" science phenomena that the author was able to make sense of was black holes and supernova. It was interesting to learn the relationship between gravity, mass, and black holes.<br /><br />This book is based on a classic in the popular science arena, and as such, is definitely worth reading.een disproven because of said quantum phenomena.

B001TH28EO|5.0|I bought this 46-cd set when it first became available for $80. That's less than 2$ per disk! I would have gladly paid that much just for some of the individual sections. Of course, if the performances were terrible, or even mediocre, I would have been much better off seeking out individual performances or competing box sets like Brilliant Classic's collection of complete Brahms works. But I already had a couple of the individual works (portions of the symphonies conducted by Karajan and performed by the Berlin Philharmonic from their digital 1980s recordings, for example)and knew that they were outstanding performances. And the roster of performing artists was a who's who of the classical recording industry: Daniel Barenboim, Wilhelm Kempff, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Maurizio Pollini, and countless others. Even though I had a good assortment of Brahms recordings, I felt this was an excellent way to fill in some of the gaps and introduce myself especially to some of the choral works and lieder that were unfamiliar to me.  I haven't listened to everything yet, but I've listened a good deal to the orchestral works (cds 1-5), concertos( cds 6-8), chamber works (cds 9-19 - and wow is that clarinet trio with Karl Leister awesome!), and the German Requiem (Giulini, Vienna Philharmonic, Schmidt and Bonney) and Alto Rhapsodie (Sinopoli, Czech Philharmonic, Brigitte Fassbaender contralto). Everything has been a first-rank performance, if not an out and out first choice, with very good recorded sound as well. I haven't begun to listen to the choral works or the solo piano recordings, and I am already blissfully content with my purchase.<br /><br />The product description offers pretty good details about the set. Here is some additional information:<br /><br />CDs 1-5 offer the orchestral works. Symphonies 1-4 are conducted by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic (according to the booklet the performances were recorded in 1986-1988, not the 1970s cycle). I've long enjoyed Karajan's 70s rendition of the symphonies, and these seem very similar but in digital sound. Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic also perform the Haydn Variations and Tragic Overture.  Serenades 1 & 2 and the Academic Festival Overture are ably performed by Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic. Abbado also leads the Vienna Philharmonic in a sprightly version of the Hungarian Dances.<br /><br />The concertos occupy CDs 6-8. Maurizio Pollini performs in the two piano concertos. The first is conducted by Karl Bohm leading the Vienna Philharmonic. The second is also by the Vienna Philharmonic, this time conducted by Claudio Abbado. The performances are very nice but won't displace my favorites (Gilels/Jochum, Fleisher/Szell). I have not yet heard Pollini's later collaboration with Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic but will seek them out based on his playing on these recordings. The violin concerto and double concerto are conducted by Karajan and played by the Berlin Philharmonic. Soloists are Anne-Sophie Mutter on violin and Antonio Meneses on cello.<br /><br />CDs 9-19 feature chamber music. Barenboim and Zukerman play the violin sonatas, Serkin and Rostropovich the cello sonatas, Karl Leister and Jorg Demus the clarinet sonatas. The clarinet trio (did I mention this was a stunning performance) is played by Leister, Tamas Vasery, and Ottomar Borwitzky. Vasery and Borwitzky are joined by Thomas Brandis and Worfram Christ on the other piano trios and quartets. String Quartets are played by the LaSalle Quartet. The Quartetto Italiano joins Pollini in the Piano Quintet in F minor, and the Amadeus Quartet participates in the other quintets and sextets.<br /><br />CDs 20-28 feature piano and organ works. Anatol Ugorski plays the 3 piano sonatas. Wilhelm Kempff plays the scherzo, 4 Ballades, and assorted Klavierstucke and Fantasias. Daniel Barenboim and Tamas Vasery play the variations. Alfons and Aloys Kontarsky play the works for two pianos (great set of Hungarian Dances!). Peter Planyavsky plays the organ works.<br /><br />CD 29-35 offer Lieder, 36-39 vocal ensembles, 40-43 choral works, and 44-46 works for chorus and orchestra. I'll leave others to comment on these performances as I have yet to explore their magic (except for the outstanding performances of the German Requiem and Alto-Rhapsodie mentioned earlier).<br /><br />I'll be enjoying these recordings for many years to come.ances!).

B00005JPUN|2.0|It's funny how a movie that's supposed to scare you about what happens when you sleep, can actually make you sleepy.   This is the fourth movie incarnation of the whole body snatcher theme, and unfortunately it's the worst. Its not the fault of the actors, instead I would blame the writing and directing.   First of all, its already been done 3 times prior, not to mention a bunch of B movie knock offs, where aliens take over humans.   The original spin here is the replacement of alien pods with an alien virus. This is actually a plus for the movie, as the whole bodies growing out of pods, and almost nobody notices  was always a bit of a stretch. A virus that infects and takes over mankind is far more believe and thus should be scarier, but unfortunately it wasn't. The vomiting int o food or people as a way of spreading the virus was far more gross then scary.   the suspense and eeriness was good for the most part, but it  also felt all too predictable.  IMO despite its flaws the 1978 version remains the best and scariest of this franchise. It's creepy music, sounds effects and horrific \\"pod scream\\" kept you on the edge of your seat. That movie reminded you of what people were losing, first and foremost the ability to love, as well as the appreciation for music, and all of the other things that make us human. It's horrific lost cause ending, made you glad it was just a movie.  This current adaption, takes the opposite approach. First it attacks humanity a couple times halfway through the movie, and then again, with its unfullfiling ending. Rather then celebrating humanity, this movie tried awkwardly, to make  some ludicrous liberal guilt argument that the aliens are better, cause they, all just get along. The happy ending where everything is back to normal, just didn't seem believable and felt tacked on. And people's attitudes about world problems at the end, just made them seem ungrateful to have been saved.  Other then the virus twist this adaption brings nothing new and worthwhile to the story.
B00192IV0O|3.0|I'm a fan and while on previous CDs, I could press repeat on any track and be happy for it to play over and over, with THE END, there are only three or four songs that had the same effect on me (namely, track 1, 12, and 13). Even then, the track 1 single that has been playing on the radio for months now has something like a minute of random narration before the song starts up. While this maybe an attempt to be \\"artsy,\\" I want to listen to music right away, not a message with no beat. If I want a book on tape, I'll buy that. Otherwise, it does seem to me that they really went into techno influenced music big time. The rhythm is really lost in many of the tracks by strange changes tempo and suprise breaks for \\"deep voice\\" narration. I don't mind the socially influenced songs if they have a good melody (like track 14 and 13 to a lesser extent), but for a group that's known for pop, the techno mixes really through me (especially, tracks, 2-7).
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|First let me start by saying I have NOT read the books so I am not disappointed in any changes from the books. I come to this movie strictly as a movie-lover and expecting another fun Harry Potter movie. I have never been so disappointed and let down in a film where my expectations were not overly exaggerated. This movie was boring, bland, overly hormone-charged, and had hardly any substance what-so-ever. Relationships are awkward, the main three don't seem to have normal interactions, the ending is abrupt, characters randomly show up on camera and then they're gone, things are introduced oddly and seem important and then seemingly forgotten (i.e., Draco's cane and the bugs that \\"make your mind fuzzy\\"), the feelings Harry has for Ginny seemed to have come out of nowhere since the last film and the attraction between Harry and Cho, scenes seem tossed together and the movie as a whole does not flow very well. The lack of emotion is very evident when a certain main character dies. And the way that person dies is quite abrupt and shows Harry as a huge wimp and completely unprepared for what I expect is coming in the next chapter. There are a LOT of things that are not explained in this movie and by a lot I mean I was lost left and right in this movie. I had to talk with people who have read the books to help understand what was not explained but having spoken with them they are much more disappointed than me. The differences they explained from the book to the movie is so great that even I'm questioning how they can make up for it in the final chapter and fix things that truly contradict the story. But like I said, I came to this from strictly a movie-lover's perspective and not knowing if things were changed or omitted. Even still, this is a very, very disappointing movie.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I have now read the book and must say the movie actually seems to do a very good job of the book. I was too upset to not be behind a 5-star rating that I had to read the book. Yes, many parts are left out and many really pointless things are added or changed but for the most part this movie did well in my opinion of sticking with the book.<br /><br />However, I feel because of the things added, the HUGE battle left out, not explaining, at least in part, the break-up between Harry and Cho between the last movie and this one that the movie was still poorly, poorly done. Every other movie alone does well telling a story, flows well with the other movies, and does not require prior knowledge of it's audience but this one almost certainly does. This movie almost seems to have been directed by someone totally different though.<br /><br />Even in the book there is not much desire to figure out who the Half-Blood Prince is so the movie was not mistaken here. Also, the book also shows a lot of \\"hard feelings\\" between the main three and not much interaction as a group so the movie showed that well (but doesn't explain it as well as the book [can't believe I'm saying that]). Also, the Wrackspurts, which make your brain go fuzzy, were also only mentioned in the beginning of the book so the movie isn't off here either. However, on that point, that is followed up by Luna's belief about the Auror's later at Slughorn's party which I don't remember in the movie. If it was there it would help paint a better picture of Luna's character and beliefs but if it wasn't then the part about the Wrackspurts seems pointless still.<br /><br />The funeral, perhaps can be used to start the next movie off in a sad, sombering way to help set things up as it appears there will be no time at Hogwarts and things will start soon after the ending we just saw. Disappointing to not see, but okay with me for now.<br /><br />So, I no longer believe we are in trouble when it comes to the next films because I do not see how things are too immeasurable to overcome. HOWEVER, unlike the previous movies or any other sequel of any sort that I've seen, this movie is still mostly boring, mostly anti-climactic, confusing from the previous movie (Harry and Cho relationship mostly), and just filled with too much fluff. There's bound to be changes from the book, but there were too many unneccessary additions. Not only did it drag this out (which no doubt adds to the bored sensation), it added to confusion to the audience as to the purpose (i.e., the waitress in the beginning, Draco's cane, and the multiple times we see Draco at the closet).<br /><br />I would love to increase my star rating, but like I said before, as a pure movie-lover's take on this, this was not higher than a low 3-star movie. But, I will still purchase the movie on DVD when it comes out to continue my collection and hope that it grows on me.e previous movie (Harry and Cho relationship mostly), and just filled with too much fluff.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|They left too much out. Period. And their editing sucks because movies aren't supposed to *feel* too long. I haven't read the book and I watched this thing drag on and on and felt bored. Bored! There is this incredible world of magic, brought to life with dazzling special effects, great costumes, compelling characters and actors with genuine chemistry. And so yeah there IS that! So thumbs-up on all that! But it was like watching half of a story unfold with crucial information and contexts edited out to make room for teenage drama. It is exactly like hearing a great story but you missed a few crucial parts and so it falls flat, and the person telling the story isn't a great story teller...And it reminds of somebody who is, in this case of Harry Potter, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n who made the most cinematic film of the series. Yes the movie version must necessarily leave out somethings, but it is the job of the writer and director to get what is essential in there while not bogging things heavily down too much. Since David Yates was chosen to do the last book, I hold out little hope, but at least they did the smart thing, giving that book two movies. Maybe that will save the day?<br />I guess they think everybody has read the books, but that seems like it would make it worse for those that have. You know every detail that skipped!<br /><br />I really have enjoyed the *film* series. I'm not a reader of the books, which undoubtedly strikes you as absurd and wrong (so I'm already aware you probably strongly feel that way, so spare me. I do read books.)<br />The director and screen writers have dragged this adventure series down and zapped it of it's excitement. It is NOT because the books are darker. If anything \\"darker\\" should mean better.

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|And so we all go now, like zombies drawn to raw flesh, or lemmings to the sea, to watch this latest intallment of the Harry Potter Franchise.<br /><br />So, why do people go in droves to see the Harry Potter movies?  Well, clearly I belong to the category of adults who have never read the books and were drawn in by their children, who did read the books.<br /><br />And at the end of it all, the only things that are clear to me about the success of the Harry Potter books and movies are:<br /><br />1. Their fascination for pre-pubescent children has always been in the fact that this is a tale of children, empowered by magic and living in a fantastical world, and able to show their stuff and prove their worth to the adults around them.<br /><br />2. The series mixes a complex fantasy world with brief interactions with the real world.  Which does create some gigantic plot holes, but it is also, I think one of the attractions of the movie series - that these are modern day British children and teenagers, easy to relate to, and living halfway in the real world, and halfway in this fantasy world.<br /><br />3. Somehow or another, \\"Harry Potter\\" managed to stand out enough from the crowd initially to become a Big Success as a book with its core audience of pre-pubescent children.  As everybody piled on top of this success, the first movie \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" (\\"Philosopher's Stone\\" outside of the U.S.) also became a resounding success.  Key to this was the casting and the careful shepharding of the storyline, and careful craftsmanship of the movie itself.  Turning a children's fantasy story into a movie goldmine is hardly automatic -as \\"Golden Compass\\" and \\"Inkheart\\" have shown.<br /><br />For me, one of the most pleasant aspects of slogging through all of these Harry Potter movies has been following the growth of the real-life actors and actresses on screen.  I think that this has been one of the main reasons for the success of Harry Potter the Franchise - the initial selection of such a group of healthy, wholesome, and really neat kids to play these characters.  Their natural likeability and talent has always come right out onto the screen, which has not been the case for other child actors (e.g., Jake Lloyd -young Anakin Skywalker, Dakota Richards - \\"Golden Compass\\").<br /><br />One wonders what would have happened if Terry Gilliam had been made the director of the first Harry Potter movie (as J.K. Rowling wanted), if the movie series would have developed a more sly and twisted sensibility than what it has become.  I would have loved to see that.<br /><br />For the movie series has evolved into a well-crafted but ponderous vehicle for decent entertainment.  The book series that it draws from was never as well constructed or well written as a fantasy world in the class of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  And thus the movies reveal their uneven, plot-holed origins from the book.<br /><br />This particular movie especially required a guidebook, as in nearly every scene, stuff just happened that was never explained.  Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one had the least amount of exposition to it, a pity, since this section deals with the Origin of Voldemort.  I had my daughter with me, who helped explain parts of the movie.<br /><br />Viewers without a guide, who have never watched a previous Potter movie, and who have never read the book series, would almost certainly be left  completely clueless by the goings on in this movie.me, and really neat kids to play these characters.

B001PR0YBM|5.0|Watched twice. The very first time, honestly I was very much disappointed, no action, no gorgeous picture, totally different from Howls or Spirited away.  It's not Miyazaki, I cried.  Second time, I just pretend I was 10 years boy, then I was so moved.  It is like best picture book. All you got to do is back when you are at that age.  Excellent movie, back to Miyazaki original!

B001AVCFJM|5.0|The long awaited prequel is out, and let me just say that Star Trek is back with a HUGE bang!    J.J. Abrams & Co. have delivered a fine product.  There is a great sense of adventure that has been lost in Star Trek for some time.    There's a reason why this film has been rated so highly all across the board from 9/10 fans, to the general public and critics.  Don't miss out!  There is great emotion, humor, action, adventure.  This is one of the few prequels, ever, that actually feels \\"right.\\"    If you are a non-fan, this is a great stand alone piece.  You needn't know anything about the Star Trek universe.    If you are a fan, your knowledge of Trek will not go to waste, however, paying attention is vital to understand how this fits into canon.    If I could make one adjustment, I would add back the Klingon scenes to fill out where Nero had been this whole time.  Perhaps J.J. doesn't understand that editing out vital pieces of information isn't the greatest idea, but this is still very worth it none the less.    Those who proclaim that the film has no substance or is \\"Not Star Trek\\" simply were either too distracted by the FX or don't understand Star Trek to begin with.     My rating, a 4.5/5!
0553213105|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I have seen the movie and loved it, so I wanted to read the book.  It can be difficult to read old english, and some words I didn't understand, but I still love the story.
B00000JTB2|5.0|If you are a Blues connoisseur, I don't have to tell you the significance of this CD.  It is truly a priceless snap shot in time when one of the old masters of Blues, Albert King get's down heavy (with the then rising star) the late great Stevie Ray Vaughn.  Some down to earth, colorful and entertaining, \\"Blues Man\\" dialogue between the two is scattered throughout this otherwise scorching studio piece     Track 3, Stevie's Pride and Joy, just smokes and is clearly my album favorite.  I believe I've listened to this CD at least a hundred times already and should buy another copy just to lock up for posterity!  This CD is well worth the slightly higher price, buy it, you won't regret it!
B00008CLOA|4.0|It's pretty hilarious reading these reviews of DSOTM; people arguing about stuff that only a dog can hear. Then there's the prices for this version or that version. I walked into a Barnes and Noble yesterday and sitting in the rack was a copy of the 1992 Doug Sax remaster. At standard retail prices!! I listened to it in my car and on earbuds and I think this is pretty much it for sound. Do you really want it so digital that all of the life goes out of it???Oh well, like I said, audiophiles are funny. Looking. I was fortunate enough to see The Floyd perform DSOTM at Merriweather Post Pavilion shortly after it was released. Four musicians and that's it. Then I turned on the TV and saw the Pulse tour and it looked like they had 20 people on stage. It didn't really make for any better listening, IMHO. A good phrase to live by in music is \\"Less Is More\\".....................
0439023483|5.0|I am happy to say The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins lives up to all expectations. Several people told me that I was going to love this book, that it was right up my alley. I was careful not to read any reviews or synopses so as not to ruin the experience. I am so glad I did. Still, here I am writing a review, part of which is a synopsis. I will do my best to give you an overview without giving anything away. (yes, the book was that good)<br /><br />The story takes place in the distant future in the ruins once known as North America, now known as the country of Panem, divided between the Capital and it's twelve Districts. As dictated by the Capital, each year, one boy and one girl from each district are forced to play in The Hunger Games. Only the winner will survive. Every moment is televised.<br /><br />This book, in a word, is intense. Put Lord of the Flies, The Lottery, Survivor and Running Man in a blender, and you'll come up with The Hunger Games. The story is told from the perspective of our heroine. I am having a hard time coming up with a comparable female protagonist as powerful as Katniss Everdeen. Katniss is from the poorest neighborhood of the poorest District in Panem, and already knows a bit about survival. For one thing, she knows what it feels like to be hungry. For another, she knows how to hunt. She is brutal, cold, and cunning, yet I was still able to really like her and root for her. Sure, there are a few quirks in her personality that didn't sit well with me, but I'll give her some slack. Aside from hating her name, the girl is fierce.<br /><br />The games, however, are downright brutal. Twenty-four children, ages 12 to 18 go into the arena, and I can promise you that they don't all survive. We don't necessarily get a good look at all of the deaths, but I have a vivid imagination, and Suzanne Collins is especially talented with the turn of a phrase. For this reason, I have to caution as to how young the Young Adult reader should be. I think that the lessons on government and communism are strong and could launch amazing conversations about governments throughout history and throughout the world, not to mention the social and political implications of televising the Hunger Games, turning it into some voyeuristic reality show.<br /><br />The pacing of this book is supersonic. I had a really hard time putting it down, and when I did, I found myself thinking and wondering about the book, the location, the characters, the government, and, especially, the Game.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has huge crossover potential -- not only to adult readers, but to boys as well. You know me, I am always on the lookout for Man-Lit, but having two sons of my own, I keep my eyes wide open for books that appeal to boys. Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and Katniss Everdeen will be the heroes on my boys' bookshelves.<br /><br />Movie Potential? I can't wait to see who gets their hands on this series! This was one powerful book, but I can only imagine how much more intense the story will be when we can see, for example, the images of the shining Capital in comparison to Katniss's gray, coal-covered, District 12. Then again, I'm not sure if putting a fight-to-the-death game on the big screen will be able retain its Young Adult audience. I can only hope that they do The Hunger Games the same justice that Chris Columbus did Harry Potter. Something tells me we won't have to wait long to find out. UPDATE: Ok, the Hunger Games fans are on the ball! It didn't take long for them to tell me that Lions Gate has optioned the movie rights, and Suzanne Collins herself will be writing the screenplay. Cool. Thanks, Amy!<br /><br />There you have it.

0375826726|1.0|This is a difficult review to write - I basically agree with ALL of the criticism Paolini has received regarding his saga, and yet I'm compelled to continue reading it.  I feel like a two-headed monster when reading the Eragon cycle - I'm simultaneously frustrated beyond belief at the writing \\"style,\\" yet I continue reading in the hopes that the plot will redeem the writing.  With Eragon, I think it did.  Eldest, eh.  Brisingr, it was just beyond all repair.      Part of me tries to pull back and say, \\"well, it's considered a young adult novel, it's supposed to be for kids, so I really shouldn't be expecting Shakespeare.\\"  That's basically the thought process that got me through the Twilight series, which, despite the not-so-wonderful writing, I enjoyed.  However, I think the biggest difference is that when reading Twilight, you KNOW that you are reading a book meant for a 12 year old girl.  Therein lies the difference between THAT sort of mediocre writing and Paolini's work:  Paolini thinks he's the second coming of Tolkien.  Between his own egomaniacal comments in interviews, his attempts at creating complex languages and political stirrings, and his pandering social commentaries, Paolini clearly \\"thinks\\" he's writing something more than a teen read.  And, I think this is why he garners so much criticism - In the end, he simply wrote nothing more than a children's book.      His attempts to make that children's book \\"mature,\\" I believe, are his downfall; in the end, he has created a book too long and boring for kids, but simply meaty enough for an adult.  The characters are 2-dimensional, contrived, unsympathetic, and just unrelateable, the descriptions and gross overuse of figurative language make your eyes bleed, and the dialogue, Lord Almighty someone save the dialogue.    See example one, his description of the moment Roran fell in love with Katrina:  \\" `I saw Katrina stop by the side of Loring's house to pick a moss rose growing in the shade of the eaves.  She smiled as she looked at the flower... It was such a tender smile, and so happy, I decided right then that I wanted to make her smile like that again and again and that I wanted to look at that smile until the day that I died.'  Tears gleamed in Roran's eyes...\\"    From a best-selling author?  Really?  I'm going to assume that his inability to come even close to describing love perhaps stems from his own lack of experience with it.  For more evidence, see the entire chapter dedicated to Roran and Katrina's goodbye (\\"Kiss Me Sweet\\"), which is chock full of clichés that would drive an English teacher mad and any reader to groan.    Another big problem for me is the terribly awkward use of different stages of English in the dialogue.  The \\"mine head,\\" \\"mine friend,\\" \\"mine people,\\" etc. reminded me of broken German.  The thus, thusly, thine, thy, aye's and even nay's were just plain WEIRD.  You'd have a character use one of the pronouns, and then use the modern English equivalent in the same manner 2 lines later.  There was no rhyme or reason, and it made the writer look precocious, and the characters stiff and unrealistic.    For another example of the highly romanticized writing, see page 69:  \\"Eragon was no longer capable of coherent thought, but somewhere in the back of his brain he was aware that he was about to die.  It did not frighten him; to the contrary, the prospect comforted him, for he was tired beyond belief, and death would free him from the battered shell of his flesh and allow him to rest for all of eternity.  From above and behind his head, there came a bumblebee as big as his thumb.  It circled his ear, then hovered by the rock, probing the nodes of citrine, which were the same bright yellow as the fieldstars that bloomed among the hills.  [...]  The bumblebee was so vibrant, so alive, and so beautiful, its presence renewed Eragon's will to survive.  A world that contained a creature as amazing as that bumblebee was a world he wanted to live in.\\"Really?    I believe that my review, while honest, is colored by my frustration that this is the third, and despite all of our expectations, penultimate book of the series.  I never buy hardcovers, but purchased this one excited to see how the series ends.  When I was about 100 pages in, I checked the Amazon site to read a review, and saw Paolini's video explaining the need for a 4th book.  I was FURIOUS by the time I finished Brisingr.  So many utterly pointless plotlines and political feuds, all of which were anticlimactic (spoiler - the guy or girl you \\"want\\" to win always inevitably does), so many unnecessarily loquacious descriptions, and just so much NOTHING.  If you read the first 60 pages and the last 150, you honestly get everything you need from this book.  So sad, but honestly, so true.    So to be completely honest, if you're like me and are irritated by the writing but enjoy the story, you truly DO NOT HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK.  The 200 (generous) pages worth of valid plot can (and will) be summarized at the start of the yet to be named 4th book.  Or, just find it on a website.  Heck, email ME.  Just don't punish your eyes and brain like so many of us did by reading this 750 page tragedy.    Will I read the 4th book?  Yes.  Will I buy it?  Unfortunately, no.  The reason why is simply this:  I feel cheated.  Had Paolini delivered a 3rd book that introduced some new meaty plot that warranted turning a trilogy to a cycle, I'd be okay with a fourth book, perhaps would be excited by it.  Instead, I just feel cheated and that both Paolini and his publishers wanted to eek out some more money from the franchise.  And that, well, just makes me mad.

He was right again.<br />The author transported me to 1940'sBarcelona, and into the lives of some of the most memorable characters I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Ten year old, Daniel Sempere, is brought to the Cemetary of Lost Books (how badly did I want to go to this place myself?) and is told by his father that he is to choose one book. Daniel chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Juli&aacute;n Carax and becomes guardian to this special tome. Intrigued by the book, and especially the author, Daniel brings us on his decade long journey in search of any information he can find. What he finds is mystery, murder, betrayal, and corruption. Daniel quickly learns that he may have the only copy of Carax's work in existence, because someone is systematically burning them all, leaving a trail of death and destruction in his wake. Can Daniel keep the book, and himself, safe yet satisfy his growing need to learn more about a man whose life parallels his own?<br />The Shadow of the Wind centers around Daniel in his father's bookshop - one of my favorite places to be in the whole world. But first, Zafon brings us to the Cemetary of Forgotten Books -- a secret place only for people who love books like they are living, breathing beings. With these two facts securely in place, I couldn't wait to dive into the rest of the story. I felt like Zafon wrote this book for a secret club of book lovers, and his readers are exclusive members. Where do I sign up?<br />I found myself trying to solve the big mysteries of the story, but there was no way I was going to stay a step ahead of Zafon, so I eventually gave myself over to the twists and turns and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. This book will stay with me for a long time.

In my opinion, any book that makes you feel, or makes you question your own morals on any given topic, is a success (like The Reader or The Road). This was the first Picoult book I ever read, but I think it will be my last. I am a mother, and my heart broke for the parents; but I also have a sister, and my heart broke for Anna as well. I felt like Picoult manipulated me somehow and sucked me into her formulaic novel just to lead me to a cheap ending.<br /><br />Without ruining the ending, (I won't, I promise), I have to explain why the ending was so horrible. Did you ever see movies like Con Air, that just when you think the movie is over and everything is wrapped up, all of a sudden you're watching 30 more minutes of gratuitous violence and airplanes being blown up on the Las Vegas Strip because some prop master had some extra M-80s in the store room or they needed to stretch the time? This is how the ending felt. Gratuitous, self-serving, and disconnected with the overall sentiment of the story. My question is this: Was it the editor's decision or the author's? Without knowing the answer, I have a feeling this might be my last Picoult book.<br /><br />Note #1, dated 3/09: I have yet to find a Picoult book jacket that doesn't make me want to jump off a bridge just from reading the blurb.

1400110335|4.0|Knowledgeable, entertaining and instructive.   The author knows what he's writting about. Perhaps a title like \\"A History of money\\" would have been best suited considering its contents.  I liked this one. Especially the fact that it emphasizes the capital importance of finances and money in the History of human kind. Financial and legal innovations have been as decisive as technology. An aspect often overlooked. Technology has been a key element but money mattered above all things.

0743298039|5.0|I do believe in ghosts - especially the ones that haunt you from the pages of a good story. Ms. Setterfield's characters are now haunting my memory. This novel is fresh and unusual and yet there is something comfortably familiar in the narrative style. Others have mentioned \\"Rebecca\\" as a similar work and I think there is some truth in that; both novels live on in your mind after you finish them but The Thirteenth Tale definitely stands on its own literary feet, haunting the reader with the unforgettable story of Vida Winter.
0743289692|4.0|For an autobiography, this book is amazingly readable. I could not put it down even though I knew how it ended. Ali writes clearly and beautifully and gives such stark descriptions of life as a woman in a third world Muslim family. The insight she gave into her transformation from a faithful Islamic believer to an agnostic was fascinating. Her explanations of her early instruction in Islam, all the prohibitions, her developing doubts, and her eventual rejection of Islam all help to make the current political climate clearer. I am not certain I can agree with her conclusion that Islam is, most simply put, evil, but I can understand that with her experiences and life constantly under threat why she must feel that way.
0316036692|4.0|To let Malcolm Gladwell take you by the hand is one of the supreme pleasures of reading. Both his enthusiasm and passion for his arguments are childlike in their intensity, and I mean that in a good way. As a result, this is a book that is gripping to read. All the issues he touches on - outlined by many other reviewers here - are important and relevant and, once they sink in, really do effect the way one looks at the world.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some who have recently accused Mr Gladwell of punditry and although I think this is unfair I have an inkling of where it might come from. For it is true to say that Gladwell has been elevated to superstar status and I think that this is overrating his importance. I had only to hear of his launch 'tour' in which tickets for a large London auditorium became quickly and fashionably sold out and my heart sank. It sank a lot further when I read a journalist's review of his 'show' describing, with no trace of ridicule, of how he looked around to observe many members of the audience scribbling into their Moleskin notebooks (of course, they weren't just ordinary notebooks). And in any case why were they taking notes about something that was going to be so clearly defined in the book they were just about to purchase and read?<br /><br />And here, I think, is the problem. This stuff is absorbing - exciting even - but it is not complicated or even complex. The fact that it is so beautifully written disguises the fact that each chapter's material tends to be padded out, nurtured and repeated rather more than is strictly necessary.  Thus we are treated twice to the same portion of a cockpit voice transcript at either end of a chapter on Crew Resource Management (though he mentions that crucial concept only once).<br /><br />On a more personal issue I feel saddened by the unfairness and injustice, as I see it, of other books in similar vein but of equal importance and equally well written being consigned to relative neglect because their authors do not have Malcolm Gladwell's fashionableness and fame. I'm thinking particularly of 'Sway - the Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behaviour' which, if it had been written by Malcolm Gladwell instead of Ori and Rom Brafman would have received more and, dare I say it, even better-deserved praise than Outliers. They also, as part of their own thesis, spend a chapter discussing a major airline disaster (Tenerife) but although their conclusions are similar to Gladwell's their material is more interesting, better marshalled and better thought through. And yet this superb book, published in the same year as Outliers, languishes down near the twenty-thousand mark in UK Amazon's rankings.<br /><br />Finally, on a more minor point, Malcolm Gladwell deserves to be better served by his publishers. I'm sure it was their idea and not his to add the jazzy strapline ' The Story of Success' beneath the title. Given that one chapter, as we've seen, is given over to two fatal air disasters I'm not sure how this description fits unless, that is, one wanted to describe all the crews' shortcomings as contributing to the making of a successful plane crash.<br /><br />After all this you might wonder why I've given this book as many as four stars. Well, as I said at the beginning, it may be a simple enough story but it's an important one for all that as well as being beautifully and eloquently told. I really adore Malcolm Gladwell's passion for his subject and his ability to convey it. For all these things he has this reader's unbridled approval.thors do not have Malcolm Gladwell's fashionableness and fame.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I saw this movie back in the Christmas season last year with some reluctance. Were it not for a good friend edging me on I probably would not have bothered. I incorrectly sensed that it was just another drippy foreign film about drippy people living on the edge and getting lucky.     Boy was I wrong.    This is such a smart, cleverly woven story with a classic twist--reminding me of Dickens--and all the stuff we love about life, but what's really striking--and I just watched this twice on DVD--is the precious love that is expressed here.    Lump in throat anyone?    Goosey bumps, too?    I just lap it up. Call me a sucker--but I had to re-play the last two minutes over and over again--where our hero brushes his sweetie's scarred cheek...and you either already know or will know the rest. It just kills me every time.The quintessential message is: LOVE OVER $$, GOLD, whatever, ANY DAY!    Amen.
1595141715|1.0|I was sucked into this book after reading the first chapter. But after that, it was all downhill.<br /><br />The narrator, Clay is too goody-goody to be a believable teen.<br /><br />The Hannah Baker character is so flat, and loathsome, that I could not feel any empathy towards her. She is so shallow and cynical -- who could care about her.<br /><br />She lists thirteen people she singles out as being the reasons she committed suicide. She goes on to explain why these people have caused her so much pain. But honestly, none of this kids are any worse than she is. She takes no responsibility for any of her actions. She blames everyone else for where she is today. And the reasons she gives are hilarious: Being singled out as having the best butt in school; being the subject of a teen peeping tom's affections; being stood up for a date. PUHLEAAASE.<br /><br />I only finished this book, so I could see how it ended. That was another letdown.<br /><br />In total, a waste of my time. There are more than 13 other things I could have done instead of read this pathetic piece of nonsense.
B0000046W9|5.0|The record company has discontinued this 4-disc set? For shame! I guess the 1-discs are selling. But if you buy 1, you must get all of Getz' bossa nova work.    Getz was supreme, the most melodius saxman ever. His solos here are delicate, yet probing and endless (in a good way). Yes, these songs hit the same emotional note, but this is much more than mood music (if Getz just banged out the melody, he'd be Kenny G). The settings are interesting, but Getz is the man. He probes and searches, the way a romantic man searches. Beautiful in a way men can dig, too.

0123694965|5.0|Every now and then, amidst the seemingly endless torrent of new publications each year on practically every subject known to mankind, there is a book that somehow finds a way to both educate and entertain it's readers. This is one of them.    There have been innumerable books on the subject of game design in recent years, many offering varying amounts of information, but few offering the unbiased perspective of this wonderful creation. The Art of Game Design approaches its title subject from a very broad viewpoint that is applicable to not only video game design, but most types of game and non-game design as well. For those in the industry (or looking to be in it) the book serves as an invaluable treasure chest of tools that can be readily applied to your design. And though this book is unquestionably aimed at designers, anyone in the industry, from AI programmers to concept artists, will find great value in here.     As has been stated in other reviews, this is not a technical book, and instead focuses on the true inherent art of design, and how various design principles from fields as different as rollercoaster design and architectural design can be applied to game design with success.    The book quite literally gives you one hundred new ways of looking at game design (the Lenses) that I feel can benefit both novice and veteran designers alike, for many of the lenses are in the form of questions that you might not think to ask yourself. (And which have an uncanny ability to point out things you might have missed.)    Adding to this the book is simply entertaining to read, making it one of those sadly all too rare simultaneously entertaining and educational experiences. Were that only all education this enjoyable...    I highly recommend this book to anyone in the gaming industry, or even thinking about getting into the gaming industry. It gives you great insight into the Art of Game Design that will without doubt be useful for many years to come.
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|I don't mind a good adolescent wish-fulfillment daydream.  I assume that's what I'm getting anytime I rent an action movie based on a graphic novel.  So I set my sights low.  And I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief.  \\"Wanted\\" however, demands that one not only suspend disbelief, but expel it permanently.  Once you've bludgeoned your disbelief into submission, however, you won't find anything in this movie that was worth the effort.  Spend the 110 minutes doing something else.  Anything else.

B001V9LRV0|5.0|I just spent a goodly chunk of my weekend steeping myself like a Boomer Tea Bag in all the content this one offers. It made me miss the feeling of my youth and my high school days from 1966-70 and my time in college immediately thereafter.<br /><br />I went to college right after high school, so I never had to go to Nam, but a few of my friends and a couple of cousins got snatched up in the draft, and so the Vietnam War was a pretty personal thing to me. I grew up with it in my living room, so to speak.<br /><br />During this time, Rock 'n Roll music was a vibrant, living, pulsating thing to a teenager, and it was directly connected culturally to almost all of the nation's youth. Today, with all the segmentation of the music to serve a specific slice of the market, no one genre of music - Rap, Hip-Hop, Alternative Rock, Folk/Americana - has the power that Rock 'n Roll does here.<br /><br />The half-million or so people who attended Woodstock pretty much back up that statement.<br /><br />Seeing the original film in the theater was a pretty powerful experience given the time it came out and the social context that surrounded it. The Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, Flower Power and the anti-war movement... seeing this movie again and having all the additional content to complement it was truly a rich experience for me. Everything looks and sounds great here... given the limitations of the recording environment changing all the time with the rain and swapping out entire bands one after the other without benefit of a sound check. Because of this 'mixing on the fly', every so often you'll hear vocals that sound sort of compressed and mushy, but not often.<br /><br />Everything there is to say about the content has pretty much been said in the other reviews, but I would like to point out one little gem buried in those extra performances - Johnny Winter doing Mean Town Blues. He's playing a Fender 12-string Jaguar electric and he literally tears it up. In my humble opinion, second only to Hendrix, this is the best guitar playing on all the discs combined. Carlos Santana, John Fogerty, Pete Townsend, a couple others... all great here, but Mr. Winter really outdoes himself with this performance. If you like your Blues with a healthy dose of nasty, greasy slide, this one cut is almost worth the full price of the entire set. What a treat!<br /><br />Lastly, I was reminded of Hunter S. Thompson in his work from 1971, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and his lamenting of the passing of the idealism of the 60's.<br /><br />He was right. There was truly something special going on then... and not just at Woodstock.est guitar playing on all the discs combined.

6305972591|3.0|\\"Children of the Corn\\" is a movie I hadn't seen in about twenty years. I remembered the premise and general plot but hadn't watched it in decades. My wife and I decided to buy it just to watch a spook movie.  Honestly, it was ok. Most of Stephen King's movies are just so-so compared to the books. While I have read a ton of King's books and am a fan for sure, I had never read this one so I can't speak to whether it was as good as the flick itself.  I do know that the casting was fine, the small town creepy atmosphere is palpable, and that kid they cast to play Isaac the little \\"prophet,\\" John Franklin, CUUUREEPY!  That kid is so bizarre-looking, just creepy! And the Malachi character is a weasle, too!    I thought the movie moved along too fast and came to a head too quickly. It became predictable.      And what seemed unrealistic to me is how an entire town of kids could keep the town a secret for three years!! Hello? No Pepsi trucks, gasoline trucks, produce trucks, or other goods ever come into that town?  How about the mayor's office and the State of Nebraska?  How about property taxes, family members out of town, and commerce?  How could an entire town like that disappear and be run by kids? I'm a teacher, trust me, kids could not run a town this smoothly! lol    I like the \\"he who walks behind the rows\\" plot and some tense, spooky moments but like many King flicks, just so-so, not the legendary cult classic keeper so many fans make it out to be. It's worth watching, probably once for me...

B001NXDIMK|4.0|Season 1 was taut and terrifying magic. Season 2 tries to mix in a major new storyline while still carrying forward the lethal fallout from last season's Arthur Frobisher case. Although teasing and confusing the viewer are part of the stylistic tone of this production, things got a little muddy with too many characters in mid-season.  Still, the Season Finale was so brilliant, it more than paid off its mid-season markers.  Meanhile, the acting of the major characters - Rose Byrne deserves more credit, IMHO - continues to shine.
031606792X|1.0|***Spoilers***    This is the best of the four books in this series, but it is still awful. Many of Meyer's writing problems (like her repetitive adjective usage) seem to have been mysteriously fixed, but other problems remain. Messages that young readers might take away are not the best.    1. The character of Jacob is authentic and well-developed:   What he says and does fits his age, personality and life situation.  The middle portion of the book, written from his point of view, was genuinely good. Some threads are not finished, like the backstory for Leah.  Why is there a female shape-shifter?  That is interesting, and while it would be stupid to make this book any longer, I would have enjoyed reading more about Leah.    2. Bella remains vapid and non-authentic:  Bella's mother is simply an afterthought throughout this book, dismissed as, \\"Oh well,  she has Phil now.\\"  While adolescent girls often don't like their mothers, they don't eliminate them this easily. She's lived with her mother all but the past two years of her life without any serious problems. She talks throughout the book about family bonds, and that is reflected in what we learn about the shape-shifters.  Then she becomes a mom herself and even names her baby after her mother. Yet we're to believe she's OK with the possibility that she's never going to see or even speak to her mother again? Doesn't invite her mom to her wedding? Isn't going to have her mom meet her granddaughter?  No way I can buy this.    3. Horrible messages about marriage:  Bella marries in order to get Edward to have sex with her.  This is actually a \\"negotiation\\" they have.  The marriage is just a formality, to satisfy Edward. Bella has so little interest in her own wedding day that she allows her sister-in-law to orchestrate everything and never even asks about details.  She basically shows up on the right morning so that she can be made-up and dressed for her role as bride. She doesn't even look at herself in a mirror on her wedding day. Oh right, I believe this - not!    4. Her husband is a pimp:  Imagine this.  Your husband understands that you want to have a child. He decides that his seed is unsuitable for you, so - without discussing this with you - he asks another man to 1) talk you into aborting the child you're already carrying, and 2) have sex with you to get you pregnant with this other man's child.  Worst of all, both men agree this is a great idea.    5.  Her father, the chief of police, is not curious about his daughter's life:  In fact, he's operating on a \\"need to know\\" basis and seems perfectly happy not having a clue about what is going on.  This is not how the chief of police would behave, and certainly not how a parent would behave. Parents are hard-wired to protect their children from danger. Young people reading this book might like to be reminded that you, as their parents, care a great deal about the people and events in their lives.    5.  The plot isn't logical:    Connections do not flow from point A to point B in a reasonable way.  For example, all the talk about the Volturi collecting \\"prizes\\" yet none of that comes to bear.  So why bore us with this? All the talk about death and loss, yet no one dies or loses anything. At the end, Alice thinks to find another human/vampire mix child to prove that this is not an unknown and therefore not dangerous. Um, how did she ever arrive at that conclusion? The author avoids having to tell us by having Alice run away during this period. And wouldn't it be great to see Jacob's reaction to having a new, fake ID? There's much, much more like this that doesn't work.    6. More terrible plot devices:  Bella needs to discover that she is pregnant while on her honeymoon so just how does a skilled author make that happen.  Let's see.  Oh right, counting tampons.  Isn't that how we all found out we were expecting, by sitting alone in the bedroom counting tampons? Puh-leese.  If we are going to suddenly introduce the idea of Bella's menstrual cycle then shouldn't that have come up, oh, maybe 2,000 pages ago since it deals with BLOOD! If you're hanging out with vampires this might have been an issue near the start of those relationships.    7. So easy it's unbelievable:  Even in the vampire world Bella's transition is simply too smooth. Though this is fantasy, I can't suspend my disbelief. A volatile, immature and arguably unstable teen is reborn as a vampire and her biggest problem is a torn dress?  Come on! The confrontation with the Volturi is the most anticlimactic reading I may have ever done in my life. The happily-ever-after ending is too tidy. No one pays, nothing is lost, nothing is earned. It is completely unsatisfying.    8. The gore:  There is a lot of blood in this book.  Bella drinks blood like milkshakes during her pregnancy, there is vomiting of blood in a spectacular, fountainous way, and Edward chews the baby out of Bella's abdomen.  There is CPR on a dead body, venom injections into the heart, some biting and more detail on the hunting and blood sucking of animals.  There is also violent sex.  While Meyer doesn't actually tell us anything about the sex act, the aftermath has Bella severely bruised.  I don't know about you, but I don't want my child growing up thinking that sex hurts, that sex is violent or that if your partner is violent enough to leave you black and blue it's OK to beg for more, like Bella does.    9. This story could have been told in two books, not four.    I read over 2,400 pages in order to complete the entire series and feel like the story could have been told in half the pages if it had been handled by a more skilled writer. She could have spared a few hundred pages just by cutting the adverbs. Then saved another few hundred by editing out useless information, like the necklace from Aro.  What the hell was that all about?    10. Even a 6th-grader can spot crap writing:  My 11-year-old enjoyed the books, but that may have been because \\"everyone elsewas reading them.\\"  Now that we've talked about each book I'm being told, by a 6th grader, that huge portions of the books were boring or unnecessary, that the plot outcomes were disappointing, that these characters are unlikable and fake people that he would not want as friends, and that it was just too easy to root for Bella to die since she was unworthy. I agree on all counts.    As I've said in previous reviews, I don't ever want to discourage my child's reading, and I think that even reading garbage like this is better than reading nothing.  But it is also my opinion that if garbage of any type is going into my child, it has to pass by me first.  (That includes junk food, junk TV and junk reading). If your child is reading this series I encourage you to read along with them and hope that these poorly written books can at least lead to interesting, productive conversations.
1596912375|4.0|I really enjoyed this book even though I was not expecting to. The author blended history and present moments really well. Most books I have read that jump back and forth through time is confusing but I looked forward to the contrast between the mothers life and the daughters current one. Each detail of the mothers life as a spy was so given at a descent enough pace to keep me hooked until it was all laid out in front of me.The two stories he told blended quite well. It has always amazed me what parents were willing to do and did to protect their country and most of the time the children never knew the extent of the sacrifice that was made. The author gave good details without overwhelming the story and by the end the daughters character had actually matured by the things she learned about her mother. Because the story was being told from the daughters point of view and the mothers story as secondary it keeps your focus on the present day. Neither character overwhelms the story line. I would reccomend this book to any one who wants a quick lesson in WWII espionage and how it still affects the people involved to this day. The war has not ended for those individuals and won't til the day they die. It is definitely going on my read again shelf. The only aspect that was not needed was the information on the main characters ex and his brother. There was really no conclusion to their story line and I had to wonder why he included them. I would have liked to see more information or a followup to the characters.

B0024F08UG|5.0|This film is one of my all-time favorites and the best of the disaster genre.  I have purchased it twice on dvd and am excited by its release on blu-ray.  This film was produced by the great Irwin Allen.  It was released in December 1974, one month after the other disaster epic of that year: Earthquake.  Towering Inferno is the far superior film.  While he may not be known to the young people of today, to those of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s, Irwin Allen was a great showman who gave us many exciting films and television shows, still remembered today.  In the early '60s he gave us 2 thrilling sci-fi films: The Lost World in 1960 and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, (one of my all-time favorites,) in 1961.  While these may have lost a lot when viewing on television, to a ten or eleven year old watching them in Cinemascope of that big movie screen, it was something indeed.  In 1964 he moved to television creating 4 classic sci-fi series that are still enjoyed today, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1964, Lost in Space in 1965, The Time Tunnel in 1966 and Land of the Giants in 1968.  He moved back to films in 1972 bringing to the screen, the disaster classic The Poseidon Adventure.  If you don't count Airport in 1970, the Poseidon Adventure is the beginning of the disaster genre of the 1970s.  He followed it up with the even more successful The Towering Inferno, a film so big that it was produced by two studios: 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. and based on two popular novels: \\"The Tower\\" and \\"The Glass Inferno.\\"  The film had a great cast headed by Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.  (Hollywood legend has it that McQueen, who had his own personal rivalry with Newman since appearing in a small role in Newman's \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me,\\" had it in his contract that he must have the same amount of lines in the script as Newman.  Supposedly, he counted them to be sure.)  The rest of the great cast included Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Richard Chamberlain, Susan Blakely, Fred Astaire (Academy Award Nomination for supporting actor,) Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn and Robert Wagner.  The only weak-link is probable double-murderer O.J. Simpson as the good-hearted chief of security.  For some reason Hollywood loved to cast this lothesome individual in nice-guy roles in films like this and The Naked Gun series in the 1980s.  This film has stunning action sequences that still hold up today.  I still love the awesome shot of McQueen, in a helicopter, staring at almost this entire massive building in flames.  Incredible on the big screen.  It has a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, who also did the great scores for Earthquake and The Poseidon Adventure.  I used to listen to my LPs of Earthquake and The Towering Inferno over and over.  It was nominated for numerous academy awards including, deservedly, Best Picture.  It was a massive success. (Unfortunately the last triumph for Irwin Allen whose next three films, The Swarm, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and When Time Ran Out all failed badly at the box-office. However he will always be remembered for this film, Poseidon Adventure and his 4 sci-fi series.)  I cannot wait to see this film on blu-ray, I am sure it will be more stunning than ever.  I cannot believe that there are any people who haven't already seen it.  If you haven't, you should.

Also wanted to add that I've listen to the series on audio and Simon Jones narration is such a joy!
B00243FQFA|5.0|This season may not have been the best, but there is no blaming the actors. The producers and writers are at fault at trying to wrap everything up in 20 or so episodes. I think it was a huge mistake to cancel this show for SGU, and I miss looking forward to Friday nights.     Even so, Atlantis was a great show and season five had several good episodes in it. The effects, as usual, were off the charts and even though the story lines were hastily put together, at least they ended it so that a movie could be made for us fans. If you did not get to see the season five, I recommend buying it and watching it.

B000063CMK|5.0|My love/hate with prog rock exists primarily due to the extensive beauty and virtuosity of the music, and the usual destruction of any real emotion by the vocals.  This destruction is caused by a typical unwritten rule in prog that vocalists must exaggerate their emotions as if they were in an odeum.  This is where 9/10 the pretentiousness identified with prog rock appears.  The problem with this (rarely ignored) axiom is that it is precisely the role of the music to provide the emotional context, therefore the vocalist should be concentrating less on classical style and more on helping establish mood by not TRYING so damn hard.  You don't have to \\"try\\" to be emotional--we're humans and not robots.  The last 1/10 of pretentiousness is in instances where the instrumentalists refuse to play anything \\"simple\\" because they feel it isn't technical--even IF simple might be a better way to communicate a passage.  While I value virtuosity there must be more to music for me to love it than something being well-played.<br /><br />That said, this band, \\"Pain of Salvation\\" does a tremendous amount to get rid of most of what I find horrible in prog music.  The vocals aren't quite as relaxed as say, \\"Porcupine Tree,\\" but they have a much more 'real' feel to them than the robotic nature of \\"Dream Theater.\\"  The title track also brings back in the melodic theme from \\"Ending Theme.\\"  A nice touch in the middle of the album.  Denying influences of Cynic, Floyd, and Weather Report would be downright absurd.  This is quite nearly a fusion album that leans heavily rock.<br /><br />What is the most wonderful thing vocally is how much effort is put into layering and harmony.  When the instruments start going a little simple you can usually guarantee that the complexity of the vocal arrangement will pick up accordingly.  In the song \\"Second Love,\\" some of the chordal harmonies remind me of country harmonization.<br /><br />In short this album breaks a lot of of the rules of progressive rock unwritten though they may be.  It reminds me of a less aggressive Porcupine Tree overall.  My favorite song is \\"Beyond the Pale.\\"  I won't bore you with the minutiae.  Just rest assured that as someone who works to find every flaw on every disc--has found very little--if anything--in the way of flaws.  Everytime I think I found one, the band fights back with something to bury it.  Not flawless, but as close to flawless as one could hope for.hey may be.

B0026JWDQW|5.0|The same thing that some of the reviewers don't like about this album is what I love about it:  it's not like his first one.  This go-round he's stretching his wings and trying different genres.  Ska, pop, jazz, blues, country/western -- it's eclectic and fascinating.  Approach the songs with no preconceived notions and I don't think you'll be disappointed.    This is how good think this album is:  As I listened to it, I realized with a start that I'm probably too old to watch the career of this young talent unfold in full.  I've never thought anything like that, for any artist, ever.  I appreciate his musical experimentation, and I hope he keeps it up.  If he wants to sing oom-pah tunes in the future -- not my favorite -- I'll still give him a listen, because he has a way of making the old feel new again.
B00008ADPF|2.0|I was pretty excited to get this after having \\"Silver Side Up\\".  I was very disappointed.  If it hadn't been for \\"Feelin' Way Too Damn Good\\" and \\"Figured You Out\\", I would have given this one star.  Thankfully, with their last two albums \\"All The Right Reasons\\" and \\"Dark Horse\\" they returned to \\"Silver Side Up\\" form.
0786852550|1.0|When I read this trilogy was a combination of Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl I bought it immediately, and it was a huuuuge deception. The trilogy is awful, I hated it, it has none of the charm of the Potter books nor the cleverness of the Fowl books.    Magicians are portraited as evil, selfish and vindictive, who use magic solely to their own good. Magical beings are their slaves, forcely brought to this world to obey the magicians orders, which may vary from cooking to delivering mail to killing their enemies.    Did I say I hated it? I would give no stars if I could.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I heard somewhere that Hayao Miyazaki was the Japanese Walt Disney. That's one of the most absurd things I've ever heard. Miyazaki's movies are nothing like Disney's. They are completely different and not at all cheesy, Disney's cheesiness almost makes me vomit. Miyazaki's films are more unpredictable, surprising, original, imaginative and endearing than Disney's stereotypical and boring movies.<br />Spirited Away is one of my favorite animated movies. In fact everything Hayao Miyazaki makes is great.

1564029654|5.0|I bought this beautifully illustrated board book for my owl-loving son when he was 22-months old. I expected him to love it and was surprised and saddened when it terrified him: \\"No, no!\\" was his reaction to the 3 little owls waking in their tree home to find their mommy gone. He could not last three more pages until the mommy returned and all was well. After trying to read it to him 3-4 times and getting the same reeaction each time, I put the book on a shelf and left it.    6 weeks later my (then nearly 24-month old son) pulled the book off the shelf and asked me to read it to him. I read the first page, and then he immediately flipped to the end when the mommy comes home, still unable to wait wade through the pages in between. This went on for 4-5 more readings until one day he let me read the whole book to him. My son just turned two and now he LOVES it and had us read to him repeatedly every day. \\"Mommy came back!\\" he exclaims each time. I'm so glad we stuck with this book; it's a sweet story, beautifully illustrated, and helps my son with separations. When I need to leave him he now says \\"owl mommy came back!\\" Yes, I tell him, Mommys always come back. He has applied this book to his own life and it gives him comfort.    Wonderful book! If your child is initially scared by it don't be disheartened, stick with it and keep it in a place where your child can bring it to you when they are ready to absorb it.
0061245097|4.0|SYNOPSIS:  Cat Crawfield has been Special Agent Catrina Arthur for four years now.  Four long years since she left her beloved Bones to ensure his safety.  This Special Agent is a secret weapon the Department of Homeland Security uses to fight vampires.  Who better than someone who is half vampire, half human and all feisty fighting machine?  That description fits Cat perfectly.  No matter how much she misses Bones her job of catching and killing vampires who prey on humans is what keeps her going until she can find the vampire who fathered her.  Once she finds him, she's going to kill him.    OPINION:  Cat has done her job so well over the last four years that she has earned the title among vampires as the Red Reaper.  Once she starts hunting them, they wind up dead.  Even though I enjoyed this second book in the Night Huntress series I thought that it lost some of it's focus.  Either that or the plot wasn't quite strong enough to take it all the way through 357 pages.  It isn't any kind of spoiler to say that Cat and Bones meet again after the four year interval and the writing of that meeting is absolutely first rate.  I think both of these characters are incredibly strong and Jeaniene Frost has continued to strengthen them throughout both books.  Now Cat and Bones are working together again but this book is primarily about having them resolve the problems standing in the way of their relationship.  How interesting to see a male character as strong as Bones is being honest, gentle and sensitive to Cat's feelings of insecurity regarding his past and her own feelings of inadequacy.  I think it is exceedingly funny for me to wade through all the blood and guts and still think of this book as a romance.  A lovely, funny, heartwarming coming together for two people who just absolutely belong together.    RECOMMENDATION:  I still highly recommend this book simply because I find so many of the characters to be so engaging.  I really like them, problems and all.  I hopethat the third installment in this series will have a more interesting plot.  I don't consider all of the family questions answered in this book to be \\"plot\\".  For me, that was filling in background and laying the groundwork for the future.  This author has an amazing talent for writing and I'm looking forward to reading [[ASIN:0061583073 At Grave's End (Night Huntress, Book 3)]] very soon and have already placed my pre-order for [[ASIN:0061583219 Destined for an Early Grave (Night Huntress, Book 4)]] which will be released at the end of July 2009.  Believe me, if you enjoy your urban fantasy with more of a fantasy twist than most authors give you, this series will be right up your alley.
B002HEOLH0|5.0|This is exactly what the fans wanted. Well crafted songs with a superb delivery. No drop off on the second release. Every song is releasable, just like the first CD. \\"Tennessee Line\\" could easily be a country cross-over while most are just excellent rock songs. If you have liked any of Daughtry's songs in the past, buy this CD. You'll love it.
1594489505|5.0|I have to admit I was skeptical at first because I thought living up to the Kite Runner expectations is going to be difficult.  Boy was I wrong. I actually preferred A Thousand Splendid Suns over The Kite Runner.  Both were great but I was able to relate to the A Thousand Splendid Suns more (possibly because the heroines are both women).  I smiled, I cried (a lot), I was moved.  These are the key indicators of a great book to me. Definitely will not disappoint.
B001K98MFK|5.0|Already stated by others, this is a very legit DVD released by Bandai. This is a long awaited purchase, I had the Dreamworks disrespectful release and it took away from the movie because it was only in japanese and you had to read and pay attention at the same time. Anyone who has even seen just a glimpse of any Ghost in the Shell release should know you're not going to get anything but confusion from that. With it in english you can really focus on the movie and the greatness it delivers.<br /><br />An amazing drama that cannot be missed, it's a very disturbing movie I must admit, but a good movie still. Just like any other Ghost in the Shell release im going to have to re-watch it cause I know there are some things I missed and misinterpreted the first time through. My only complaint is since it's been a while since I had time to watch anything Ghost in the Shell, the voices took a little getting used to in this film. It could just be in my head though.<br /><br />This is a great film, a must see for fans of movies, fans of drama, fans of movies that make you think, fans of disturbing films and more importantly, fans of Ghost in the Shell.
B000001ESF|5.0|This breakthrough album (Rush's 4th) is a masterpiece of progressive hard rock/metal that cemented Rush as a force to be reckoned with. Here, the title track is Ayn Rand influenced, and is very intellectual; this was something quite unique for its time because the song contains heavy metal elements to go with intellectual lyrics. 2112 is an album that hits every part of the prog rock spectrum. The second half of the album is diverse, containing acoustic guitars, a soft ballad with mellotron (TEARS), and finishes with the powerful SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. Overall, 2112 is everything a great prog album should be: intellectual, musically diverse, and powerful. Geddy Lee's vocals are also in top form here.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|I first saw Seven Samurai late at night on PBS when flipping through the channels as a teenager.  The movie kept going and going, it was so long, but I was totally absorbed and before I knew it I had spent the whole night watching it and didn't go to bed until around 4am in the morning.  Now I'm 37 years old and it remains one of my favorite movies.  When Criterion released a DVD of the movie in 1998 I bought a copy right away.    I enjoyed watching the movie once again, and got the added benefit of Japanese film expert Michael Jeck's excellent commentary.  After reading the reviews about the higher video quality of this new Criterion release, I bought the new DVD as well and have enjoyed watching it on my 50 inch plasma.  It's worth every penny to have the best copy of this great movie.    The one thing that puzzles me though is the different subtitles on the new release.  Michael Jeck's commentary on the 1998 release was partly based around the subtitles.  For example,  in the part when three of the Samurai go and set the bandits' fort on fire and cut down the bandits as they come running out,  afterwards one of the Samurai tells Kikuchiyo \\"Well done\\" because he came up with the idea.  Mr. Jeck points out that this is actually the moment when Kikuchiyo is accepted and becomes a full fledged member of the Seven Samurai.  On the new release, according to the subtitles, the Samurai simply says \\"We did it.\\"  What was the point of changing the subtitles like that?  Still, Seven Samurai is a timeless classic.
0783226063|5.0|People who complain that this much maligned film version of Frank Herbert's classic novel left out too much elements completely miss the point. David Lynch had to dramatically simplify the story and add scenes not in the book to fit it into a feature film length format, yet he managed to retain enough elements to still tell an interesting, epic tale. But that's not this film's main acomplishment.<br />What made this film survive it's disastrous box office run and eventually become a cult classic was Lynch's vision, which effectivelly translated the feel and look of a dark and medieval future civilization where  religion and mind altering drugs are more important than machinery.<br />The production design on this film is visually stunning, and I doubt it will be ever duplicated. Each planet has it's unique look and feel, both on sets and props, and the desert scenes on Arrakis are simply breathtaking. The costumes are incredible, they make the Atreides look strong and noble, the Harkonnen's evil and amoral, the Corrinos regal and decadent, the Fremen tough and weathered, the Bene Geserit manipulative and intimidating and finally, the Spacing Guild mysterious and menacing. Some of the photo compose effects might seem a tad dated today, but they still hold up pretty well, and ultimately look much more real and believable than the CGI overload on most Science Fiction today.<br />The casting on this movie is impeccable, and the acting is top notch, something really uncommon for the genre. I could go on forever raving on this particular points, but I'll just focus on Francesca Annis: not only she looks ravishingly beautiful, her portrayal of Jessica as a strong an intelligent woman is flawless. Some people criticize Kenneth Mc Millan, Paul L. Smith and Sting for their over the top Harkonnen portrayals, but I think they were a necessity, considering the short screen time they had to effectively establish them as the ultimate evil doers.<br />In hindsight, I think the main reason this movie failed commerciallly is that it was marketed as a Star Wars like epic, and didn't really deliver on that promise. Lynch's narration may be flawed, but at the same time it focused on some of the more interesting aspects of the novel, such as the strangeness of this particular civilization, and the spice expanding consciousness, conveyed through surrealist dream sequences. This movie will be ultimately remembered because of it's powerful visual portrayal of one of Science Fictions most beloved novels, and that's all that really matters.vie failed commerciallly is that it was marketed as a Star Wars like epic, and didn't really deliver on that promise.

B001EOOQEC|5.0|DEHUMANIZER saw the return of Ronnie James Dio as the frontman of Black Sabbath, after a 10-year gap where he pursued his solo career.  Fans are treated to a much heavier album, compared to the other two Dio Sabbath releases, HEAVEN AND HELL, and MOB RULES.  Geezer Butler deserves a lot of credit for making this album as heavy as it is, Dio for the darkness of it, and Tony Iommi for the great catchy riffs.  Vinny Appice does a superb job as usual, too.  What strikes me the most about this album is the limited success of it.  Dio is a heavy metal icon, so what was the problem?  Perhaps it's because fans of Dio-Sabbath didn't know that he was on this album?  Those who weren't crazy about Tony Martin just assumed that he (Tony) was on this album? Whatever the case may be, it's a shame, because this album really rocks.  Master of Insanity is the best track on the album, in my opinion, because of the catchy riffs, subject matter and vocals.  Letters from Earth is my second favorite track, followed by the fast and heavy T.V. Crimes.  These three songs alone are enough to buy the album, but the others are just plain great, as well!!  (9.5/10)
0060512806|1.0|I decided to stop reading this novel at page 100, and now use it as a paperweight.  It's the only way I can rationalize paying nine bucks for one of the most tedious, overwritten pieces of crap I've ever read.
0060512806|2.0|I'm shocked by the critical acclaim this book received in the sci-fi category but I suppose even a turd can float. Two stars is really pushing it. Maybe a star for the number of laughs I got per 100 pages. This is the work of a technically inept egomaniac. He does have some technical background (he drops Unix hints and anagrams the name of a supposed deity who dies and then later comes back w/ no explanation??) However, it's not enough \\"savoir faire\\" for any of the content to make sense. It might sound dangerous to some but just plain stupid to computer geeks such as myself. It's obvious that this is not his first book by the way that the author is allowed to recklessly abandon the main plot (or any of the 4 sporadic narratives) for 70-100 page tangents. If he hired a first yr EE student to clarify some basic principles, got some ritalin and snipped about 500 pages, this book *might* be tolerable. Like many technical books or movies, I was utterly disappointed.     Why did I continue? First, it was a gift and I would feel ungrateful if I didn't give it a fair chance. Secondly, there are many alternating plots that the reader would naturally be led to believe that the lives of these men parallel each other in a different time and place. If you like mysteries, you can almost imagine how these people are related. This would have made the book entirely more interesting. But then nothing. I finished the book and whipped it across the room. Later, I skimmed the last half of this 900+ PAGE SLEEPER to see if there was an overlooked morsel of evidence that made all these separate lives connected which would have made all of the silent pain and suffering from that book worth something. Nothing. Exactly what I got from the book: nothing.
0785814531|4.0|When you think of Poe, you generally first think of his classic macabre short stories and poems, and then perhaps you also think of his detective fiction, often considered the forerunner of Sherlock Holmes and company.    But after finishing this book, I discovered that those really made up a small amount of what he wrote. Mostly he seems to have written rather heavy handed satire. Maybe it was funny back then, but it's not especially funny now. Perhaps if there were annotations explaining just what he was satirizing, it would be better. But even so, most of it is just, so, er, thickly written, that it's hard to wade through.      So basically, I think you're probably off just buying a book that isn't so complete. You really probably don't want to read most of this.    That said, for $10, it's a pretty good deal. Lots of pages, seems sturdy of binding and paper. It's a little hard to read, I don't know if it's the text size, the type face they used, or if I need glasses.
0385737424|5.0|This is the kind of book that wins the Newbery. Remember that next year, because I will be very surprised if this doesn't get at least a Newbery Honor, or even win.<br /><br />It's the kind of book where various bits and pieces manage to seem symbolic even as they do a perfectly good job of carrying the story along. How can a story full of such ordinary details seem so intense and cosmic? Perhaps the greatest trick the author pulls off is to put in vats of significance without adding even one viscous drop of that goop, pomposity.<br /><br />When You Reach Me is a book that weaves in another book, A Wrinkle in Time, for more than one reason.<br /><br />It's a book that talks about friendship in a way few books have. Among them is Louise Fitzhugh's Harriet the Spy, another book which is alluded to once here, albeit obliquely.<br /><br />And even though When You Reach Me is a book about kids and friendship, I spent the whole thing in a near-breathless state of suspense. Because something bad is obviously going to happen--probably. So this book is also a mystery. Maybe it will win an Edgar award, too.<br /><br />When You Reach Me reminds me a little of Markus Zusak's book for teens, I Am the Messenger, except that the ending of this one works better.<br /><br />Is When You Reach Me science fiction? Fantasy? Magical realism? A coming of age story? Not so coincidentally, the same questions have been asked about A Wrinkle in Time. I was reshelving my own library by genre the other day and stood there for five minutes with L'Engle's book in my hand, trying to decide where it should go. I never really came up with a satisfactory answer. (Louis Sachar's Holes is a little like that, as well.)<br /><br />There's something poetic about this book.

She had picked up some carpet samples at a store on Amsterdam Avenue and written the kids' names on the backs. After lunch, she'd pass out these carpet squares and we'd pick our spots on the living room floor for nap time. Sal and I always lined ours up to make a rectangle.<br /><br />\\"One time, when Sal had a fever and Louisa had called in sick to her job and kept him home, the day-care lady handed me my carpet square at nap time, and then, a second later, she gave me Sal's, too.<br /><br />\\"'I know how it is, baby,' she said.<br /><br />\\"And then I lay on her floor not sleeping because Sal wasn't there to press his foot against mine.\\"<br /><br />So please, follow Miranda around and try to figure out why her best friend, Sal, is avoiding her. Check out the two-dollar bills, the V-cut, Alice's bathroom dance, and Julia's silver bracelet. Wonder for yourself why the homeless guy on the corner sleeps with his face under the mailbox, also whether Miranda's mom will win when she goes on Dick Clark's game show, The $20,000 Pyramid.

B00192IV0O|4.0|After a couple of years off and a couple of solo albums, the Black Eyed Peas returned in full force in 2009 with \\"The E.N.D.\\" or \\"The Energy Never Dies.\\"  Those looking for material from the Peas' like their first two albums are out of luck. This record cements their place as a pop group than a hip-hop act, which I accepted and a listener has to accept in order to enjoy it. However, the Peas deliver a solid record if you're looking for party/feel good records to hear. Think along the lines of previous hits such as \\"Lets Get Retarded\\" or \\"Where's the Love?\\"  Production wise, every beat on the album is a winner and makes you want to dance. Song like the lead smash single \\"Boom Boom Pow,\\" \\"Meet Me Halfway,\\" \\"Rock That Body,\\" \\"Alive,\\" and \\"One Tribe\\" are among the album's best.  However, the album has its downsides too. The lyrics are simple and corny. And those looking for a Peas album are a little bit out of luck, as vocals are mostly handled by Will.I.Am. and Fergie.  Overall, \\"The E.N.D.\\" is a great feel good party album. While the content lacks, it certainly makes you want to move and makes you forget your problems or stresses. Will.I.Am. said in a recent interview previous Black Eyed Peas albums called on listeners to dance. But he said \\"The \\"E.N.D.\\" commands listeners to dance, and I would have to agree with him.  The Black Eyed Peas called this album of embracing change in music and as a group. This album definitely fits that description.
B001GCUER0|5.0|The second season of MAD MEN is even better the first, which already established it as perhaps the best series to debut on American television in this decade. The pleasures are not simply in the plot (although it moves quickly and constantly surprises you) or in the acting (though it is also topnotch), but in the details: in some ways this series is the early 21st-century equivalent of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, in that it brings us back to a more conservative time among some very privileged and powerful New Yorkers, and immerses us completely in the precisely observed anthropological details of their lives. (The attention given to the clothes, hairstyles, design, and mores of the early Sixties period is, as in the previous season, breathtaking.) But here the top of the heap are not marked out as in the Wharton novel by familial connections (though those too are represented here--and shown to be largely dying out) but, as fitting the Kennedy era, by capitalistic endeavor.     The series's central characters, by the beginning of the season, have achieved certain prizes for themselves, but all at a price. Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the creative head of the Madison Avenue agency Sterling Cooper, has been promoted to the position of partner. His beautiful blonde wife Betty (January Jones), has worked out some sort of arrangement with her husband after the first season's finale that he will no longer stray from her or be away for long unexplained periods. Roger Sterling (John Slattery), Don's  arrogant and entitled boss, has overcome two coronaries and is back in the office. His former mistress, the office manager Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), finally has landed the handsome man with a bright career she's dreamed of finding, while her former charge in the secretarial pool, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) has climbed her way to become Sterling Cooper's first woman copywriter. Even the slimy Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), whom Don vanquished at the end of the previous season, is married to a woman who adores him and enjoys a Park Avenue apartment. But no one is happy, or willing to settle for what they have; they all feel they could somehow do better. Their ability to jeopardize everything they have for what more they might get is what makes the series so brilliant a commentary on the America of 1962. The best of the actors, Hamm, Slattery, and Holloway (and also Melinda McGraw as a new character, a Borscht Belt comedian's tough and sexy wife), disappear so into their characters you would be able to recognize them walking down the street just by their postures; the writers are up to the same high level, and most every gesture or line of dialogue has layers of meanings. (Pay attention, for example, to the multiple subtexts of a bit of business in the season's second episode, when Pete Campbell's mother, during the midst of a family crisis, insists on giving her daughter-in-law Trudy a porcelain elephant tchotchke.)    One of the pleasures of this beautiful DVD set is that the series creator Matt Weiner provides commentary for almost all the episodes; he has such a firm sense of what he wanted to do with every scene that his commentary is terrific and tells you how almost everything you caught the first time round was intentional. (Also, he blessedly mostly eschews the jargon most television writers use in describing their work.) The season is worth multiple viewings, and is as textured and finely worked as a great multi-plot novel. The DVD set also comes with some dandy other extras besides episode commentaries, including an overview of Jacqueline Kennedy's February 1962 televised tour of the White House (which features importantly into the season's first episode), capsules of the era's historical events, and an informative guide to 1960s fashion styles, which covers the entire decade and might be a clue to what we'll see in upcoming seasons.

I was disappointed to find out it was only 2 channel as opposed to surround sound, but more disappointing was the average sound quality. I own the 20th anniversary remastered edition on CD and put it on to compare it to the SACD version. The remastered edition actually had cleaner sound.<br /><br />While the stereo mix on the SACD did seem enhanced, the sound had a somewhat muffled quality compared to the clarity I was used to from the remastered edition. But more than that, the disappointment of no surround mix is truly a deal breaker for me.
B000ZEE3I6|4.0|This crew they have had on the last couple movies really did a hack job from book to screen..And this movie has been the worst case yet..These people must be idiots to cut and paste as much as they did..Its unbelieveable the amount of stuff they left out...And then added useless stuff into it..The movie by itself was good, but if you have not read the book you could be quite confused..They mention or show little bits of stuff that are NEVER EXPLAINED...I don't understand why they just don't make the movie longer and keep it more true to the book series..Obviously there making enough money from these movies..Too bad Chris Columbus left the project after the second movie..He did the best job keeping to the books..If you could can forget about the book, you might really enjoy this movie..Other wise, you will be highly dissapointed..

1577314808|5.0|This book is definitely one of the most clear and easily understood books written on spirituality around.  It has a purity of thought that is refreshing and most thankfully, there is no agenda underneath as is common with other new age books. Tolle is unique because he has personally experienced the profoundness of the \\"now\\" and can communicate this clearly to his audience.  A lot of people talk about the beauty of living in the moment and the profound spirituality that is found there, but not so many have actually experienced it as deeply as Tolle. The continued reading of this book will help you separate from the mental chatter and noise in your head and thereby become more \\"present\\" in your own life.  It is not a book to read cover to cover and then to be put down and be done with.  Rather, it is much a companion for the rest of your life, a book that will give you amazing insights throughout the years.  My experience is that it has much to offer, and is understood in layers.  For example, a reader will read and understand a passage at one point in their life, but at another time, say, when the reader has matured, the same passage will now be understood at a deeper level and take on new meaning.  This book about the \\"now\\" is in reality timeless, because its ideas are pure, good and reflect the truth.  My life has dramatically changed for the better as a result of this book and so it is highly recommended.

0812975219|3.0|Some interesting anecdotes, but nothing really practical here, other than the warning that life is random, and you can't expect it to be anything but random. A more useful book is something like \\"How to Lie with Statistics.\\" Still, it was interesting enough to pass a plane flight with.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|This is the best Ray Charles Album he ever recorded.  You will be in tears after hearing it.
B0000257O9|3.0|Originally released in 1980, I'm sure everyone knows (by now) their hit \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" was the very first-ever video that appeared on Mtv - BIG deal! Have to admit, though - that 'The Age of Plastic' turned out a bit better / more listenable than I had expected. I mean synth-pop (with me) is sort of a crap shoot - but I did get a certain amount of enjoyment out of this CD reissue. Tunes I was sort of impressed with were the previously mentioned - quirky \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\", \\"Elstree\\", maybe \\"Johnny On The Monorail\\" and the semi-cool bonus cut \\"Technopop\\". Personnel is a duo - Geoff Downes-keyboards & drums and Trevor Horn-guitar, bass & vocals. Keep in mind that both players are huge Yes fans. Should appeal to fans of Naked Eyes, ABC, Soft Cell, Kajagoogoo and possibly Haysi Fantayzee (anyone remember them?).
B001TODCII|4.0|Action-packed and emotionally driven is the best I have to describe this one.  I'm not a fan of action movies made just for the sake of lots of fighting, daredevil driving and shoot 'em up scenes.  But, this one has all of that (for anyone who is or is with someone that loves those) and enough genuine heart and motivation to keep those not satisfied with \\"all action\\" happy.<br /><br />I do love Liam, and with the action, he brings the role of disenfranchised-father-who's-passionate-about-creating-a-meaningful-relationship with his daughter to life well.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Great movie for couples who enjoy action and a story with heart simultaneously, or anyone who enjoyed similiarly veined [[ASIN:6304806434 Con Air]] or the original [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]]
0375836675|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning to the very end. It is an extremely powerful book. Not just because the moral and story itself is powerful (which they definitely are!) but because the writing and characters are so real this could be happening to anyone. Throughout the entirety of this book I doubt that there is one time that you will go that could never happen in real life. Please read this book it may not change your life but I'm certain you will love it just as much as I do. It is now my top favorite book.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|I didn't find a whole lot to like about this movie to be completely honest. American Gangster had a pace that was only sometimes interesting probably because there wasn't enough action segments to keep me satisfied- just spoken bits that were never really memorable, and every time Russell Crowe spoke in his character role the quality of the storytelling felt like it slipped a little.  It's like the movie kept tricking you into thinking it would become more interesting with every new segment but never delivered.    I realize most people who've watched American Gangster really respect it, but I can't bring myself to call this film a classic or anything- just barely good enough to keep a story flowing, and nothing more.

B000002J1M|2.0|The long glossy reviews are sympathetic writings of people with fond memories of the past. I'm an encyclopedic collector of many bands from the era, and this one is frankly, not all that.<br /><br />Foxtrot simply shows it age. You're bound to be disappointed. I would recommend \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" over this, unless you are a sentimentalist from the 70's

B00008EUMA|5.0|Sin duda, el &uacute;ltimo disco pesado de Megadeth y tal vez el mejor.  Esta edici&oacute;n en vinil nos da muchas expectativas como las de los otros discos reeditados en acetato, lamentablemente es m&aacute;s lo que ofrecen en la etiqueta de cl&aacute;sicos remasterizados, ya que el sonido no es tan bueno como se pudiera esperar, sin embargo, para los que no pudimos comprar el LP en su tiempo, esta es una oportunidad que no se debe rechazar para tener esta joya en vinil.  Saludos!!!
B00284BMBM|1.0|Its hard to imagine how so much talent and energy has been channeled into a formulaic, massively derivative, and predictable effort.<br /><br />While it's done with passion, you've heard every hook, line and rif. Vacuous waste of space, not to mention time.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Some people may talk negatively about this album because they do not like mainstream music.  However, if you appreciate production value or musical talent at all, you will recognize that Thriller is above any other album you could possibly own.    There really isn't any part of this album, down to the second, that is bad.  From WBSS to Lady in my Life, it really is the perfect album.    The bonus tracks on this 25th Anniversary edition really aren't that great, it seems like the label was just trying to attract a younger audience to Thriller.
0525951113|4.0|This is one of those fascinating books that keeps calling you to pick it up again and promises more with each read.  I'm only a nascent computer user so I appreciated the fact that the main character used his lack of knowledge as an excuse to ask fellow characters for explanations.<br /><br />Ever since Dean Koontz's \\"Demon Seed\\" back in the 70's about a computer who controls a house and HAL in 2001 I've been fascinated with the dark side of computers.  This story is the culmination of all my fears and even worse.  This is a well written book, a high tech thriller that keeps the reader in the loop and a book that leave you wanting more......bg
B002AH46BU|4.0|Barbara Tuchman is perhaps best known for her work on the First World War, \\"The Guns of August', a 1960s icon due to the Cuban Missle Crisis and the referral to it by then President Kennedy, who had been reading Tuchman's History and explaining the blundering of heads of state that bring countries to war. This more than anything else must have been the most timely book ever in consideration that we were all facing nuclear elimination at the time!  Well, here we have something totally timely and similar. We stand on the brink once again of the danger of plague and pestilence, the possibility of a new little ice age, and a return to feudalist views on the way our society is structured, as large governments and the weight of containing a society cause our civilized world to break up. so the re-issue of this Historical account of a terrible time to be alive in the 1300s has it's modern day value.         Tuchman accents French aristocrats and weaves events in Europe showing both the positive and negative effects of a Century of trouble.           The real horror is the arrival of the Black Death in Europe. Her account shows the devastating toll that it took as it toured around the countryside, taking anywhere from 10 percent to nearly 100 percent of human life as it past and leaving Europe so depleted that prosperity of a kind began to flourish after the loss because those losses had been so great. An average of 50% were dead. The Church of the period of course not understanding germs and science not having reached any enlightened level of development reacted with attempts to stem the tide with physical mortification groups, much prayer, etc.          The Pope was saved due to his doctor surrounding him with bowls of fire day and night and limited his exposure to any human contact. So today, as we are on the verge this fall of possibly seeing a return to the 1918 situation of deadly influenza taking a serious toll on humanity, a lack of sunspot activity causing us to have a year without a legitimate summer, and impending crop failure from excessive rains, etc and cold at night, which is reflective of everything that Tuchman wrote about in this work of 1978.         By the way, the hardbound featured here is exactly like the original in every respect. I know because I bought this book as a Hardbound in the 1970s when it was first issued in a bookstore and an era that no longer exists. Buy now and avoid the rush to Judgement!
0307346617|5.0|This was a well written book from start to finish. The characters, or more like the interviews, gave a great picture of what was happening or had happened at the time. The story flowed well from one interview to another and the amount of details was just perfect (not too much, but enough to get a clear picture).     My favorite part, and something I never thought of is Zombies in water. When one of the characters at the beginning talks about zombies grabbing at feet while trying to swim, I literally got the chills.     Like I said, this was a great book, and the worst part is that it had to end. I wanted more! :)
0312539517|3.0|I am not sure if this is a \\"historical novel\\" or an \\"erstatz biography\\".  Although I did read the whole thing, one could easily put it down and forget it, since Paths of Glory could bore anyone to tears.  Archer could have cut the lenght by 20% and the reader would have missed very little.  Much of the progress is marked by many of the letters Mallory sent to his wife.  Supposedly he would always write her a daily letter.  However I don't know if these are Mallory's authentic letters or if they are a contrivance by the author or if they are an embellishment.  Anyway, slogging through all the letters to pinpoint what is happening to George Mallory is a boring read.  A couple letters would have been better than too many.    If one is interested in 1920's mountaineering and that period this may be a good read.  If you are not then this book may not be for you at all.
B001FO7JTA|5.0|Ok Amazonians, here comes my review for AC/DC Black Ice. It's a doozy. I put off buying this album because back in Oct.2008 I wasn't feeling it, too much responsibility in my life, and not enough time to rock out on AC/DC. I F'in love AC/DC all the way, but our relationship is on and off. I always know they will be back in my life when the time is right and will rock my socks thru the floor when we get together again, and thats what keeps them fresh for me. I decided to jump and grab this newest release a few weeks ago, to coincide with my AC/DC tickets (next week baby!) and based on the fact that my little brother had recommended it to me. (Note: My little brother is not a fan, yet he says he thought that Black Ice was really good! I knew the time had come)<br /><br />I got this bit on vinyl, because I collect vinyl, and I thought it would be a cool addition to my collection. This opened up the door on a weird mystery for me, as I bought this used from a third party distributer, and recieved some sort of bootleg vinyl copy. (I paid 12.99 opposed to 29.99... listen to what happened...)  The record came sealed. In good condition, but with no dust jackets. The labels say Columbia, and look legit. The vinyl album, which is divided into four sides, sounds great and contains the right music on sides 1,3 and 4. Side 2 however contains a bizarre set of Clash covers, seemingly recorded by some cats at a bar. I'm not kidding. I must find out what thats all about, But,, I'll get back to that...<br /><br />AC/DC is in top form here. Seeing as how every album since Mutt Lange left the producers seat has been gritty as hell, and sometimes downright trash (but still great IMO) and seeing as how Brian Johnson has progressively sounded more and more ready to croak on every album since 1985 (but still AWESOME!) to the point where 2000's Stiff Upper Lip sounded like it may have been recorded by the band on their private hot rock in Hell... this album is amazingly clean, tight, and crystal clear sounding. They went back to 1974 and stole up Geordie era Brian Johnson and put him on the mic...it's the only real explanation. He sounds insanely fresh. (Probably cut down to like only six packs of non-filters a day...)<br /><br />Seriously, every song sounds great! This is an album for rock fans,.. not just another bone for AC/DC fanatics like myself. It's worthy stuff for any age. They use a lot of the backing vocals too, which works to heavy advantage, and theres some nice suprises in terms of varying up the sound from song to song, without spoiling the formula.<br /><br />Now, my biggest problem is that tracks 5-8 are lost on my weird copy here, and I really want to hear them, because the rest of this thing is so good. I picked up back at track 9 DECIBEL, and it was a real cool bluesy rock swing thing happening, into the slide guitar MAY DAY. Doesn't sound like there was any slump at all on side two... except for the fact that its NOT THERE!!!<br /><br />If anyone has any info on this Clash covers mystery**, let me know post haste. I will buy the CD in the meantime cuz it ROCKS, and I'll keep this vinyl oddity for conversational purposes obviously... and I'll leave you with this.<br /><br />First, The album is their best in YEARS! Get IT!<br />Secondly, The vinyl sounds amazing, but be careful where you get it if you do, cuz some cats are slagging out bootlegs! You may just pay the full thirty, and make sure it comes with dust jackets inside!<br /><br />And finally ROCK OUT KIDS! Either way, I got something to wail and I'm digging it. Even if a quarter of the album was replaced with Clash songs... some things you just can't explain away, Y'know?  Later!<br /><br />** after a lttle research I discovered that side two is actually the second side from the limited edition vinyl pressing of The Clash live at Shea Stadium. They must have been printed in the same warehouse aye?  Well, Guess I'll have to review that album next!ding.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I was skeptical of purchasing this album. I thought this album was mediocre at first, but the more I listened It grew on me. She loves pop, rock and theater. She wrote all of her lyrics, all of her melodies, and played most of the synth work. She took two parts dance-pop, electro-pop, rock with a splash of disco, and burlesque and generously poured it into the figurative martinin glasses of the world in an effort to get everyone drunk with this record. This album is about how anyone can feel famous. She believes that pop culture is art. She also shows her passion for love songs on such softer tracks like \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Eh Eh\\". So far, this album has been certified Platinum.
1843106698|5.0|Having two member of my immediate family who have Aspberger's Syndrome, I can attest how good this book really is.  It is detailed and organized and covers important areas of challenge in all age ranges.  It can point a person in the right direction, especially if one is just learning about this neurological difference.

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's book is, in short, truly amazing! I purchased it initially with the hopes of gaining a better insight into the life and times of Lincoln but left with a wonderful understanding of his entire administration and a newfound appreciation for the deftness with which he assembled this group of strange bedfellows. Goodwin's portrayal of Lincoln as a political genius who completely embodied the notion that \\"a house divided against itself cannot stand\\" was phenomenal. We can see how Lincoln exemplified this quote in not only his handling of the north-south conflict but by the way he reached across the isles to all parties and competitors to unite them in the pursuit of one endeavor: the eradication of slavery. This book is a great read and will surely have you hooked after the first page! I highly recommend it.

The fast songs rock, especially \\"Painkiller\\" and the slow(er) songs are good too, check out \\"Touch of Evil\\" both classics.  Good cd, Good band, go get it, ok?
055380684X|5.0|Coyle's argument is reasonably easy to summarize--a catalyst \\"ignites\\" someone's passion to learn a skill (tennis, soccer, violin, piano), the skill is acquired by the hard work of \\"deep practice,\\" abetted by \\"master coaching,\\" with the outcome being \\"talent\\"--as Edison said of genius, it's more about perspiration than inspiration.  To put it in the context of the old joke about how to get to Cargenie Hall, if you are asking about how to get there, your passion has been ignited--now you need to \\"practice, practice,\\" and find a good coach to help you practice well.<br /><br />The \\"Talent Code\\" explains the neurological process by which talent develops--every signal produced by \\"deep practice\\" adds a sheath of myelin to the brain's neural pathway for the signal, increasing the speed and strength of the transmissions across many myelin sheathed pathways.  Master coaches reinforce the construction of these pathways by giving their charges large volumes of targeted, relevant information rather than praise or criticism--the information and the deep practice work together in a feedback loop until \\"talent\\" emerges at the macro level in the form of, say, a Lance Armstrong or a Michael Jordan.  The success of one person from a given context (a city, a country, or a school, for example) will then ignite the passions of others similarly situated (\\"if she can do it, I can do it better\\"), which results in the emergence of the \\"talent hotbeds\\" that Coyle describes.<br /><br />One take home concept for me is the idea that organizations that systematically identify and fix problems are more likely to succeed in the market place than those that do not.  The poster child for this idea is Toyota, which has successfully implemented \\"kaizen\\" (continuous improvement) as a strategy. Kaizen is the process of finding and fixing small problems--no magic bullets, just one incremental improvement at a time, over and over again.  Any employee is empowered to stop the Toyota assembly line if he or she spots a problem, and most of the company's solutions come from employees.  Thousands of improvements over many years add up, and Toyota is now the largest auto maker in the world while the the Detroit Three teeter in and out of bankrupcty.<br /><br />In a book of this length, of course, there's always a certain \\"just so\\" quality to the argument.  We hear of all the examples of \\"talent hotbeds\\" and processes that tend to support the author's thesis, and we're left to wonder about how much contrary evidence might be out there.  I'm sure that point will be well-debated in the years to come--in the meantime, the \\"Talent Code\\" will make me consider how I and the organizations I work with can become more \\"talented.\\"r she spots a problem, and most of the company's solutions come from employees.

B001R0KH3M|2.0|After seeing Stevie play live in the early 90s, in what I believe was one of the best concerts I have been to, I bought this DVD with much anticipation.  What a disappointment.  Talk about the emperor's new clothes.  Dull, lifeless with an over focus on love songs (nothing wrong with love songs), but its a concert not a quiet evening in.  The energy and the on-your feet response I experienced live is sadly missing and looking at the audience was missing for them to.  What promised so much - a real waste of money.  Watched it again and it was even worse.  Must have been his pension tour so the two stars remain.    June 2011 - JUST WATCHED STEVIE'S PERFORMANCE ON RECENT THE HALL OF FAME DVD.  HE WAS/IS FABULOUS AND CONFIRMS MY OPINION OF WHAT A DISSERVICE TO STEVIE \\"LIVE AT LAST\\" DVD WAS
0143036556|4.0|First, the bad:    To my liking Prof. Diamond goes a little too far with his constant reminders about our responsibility to manage our environment. Yes, you want to draw a parallel between ancient Polynesian/Norse/Anasazi cultures that collapsed, and our own civilization, but don't Al Gore me on every other page.    Aside from that, what an awesome book! I didn't really know much about ancient societies living in Americas, but always wanted to read up on them more, so it was a fascinating read.     The most compelling parts of the book (in my opinion) are about various Polynesian islanders. Some of their societies collapsed due to many factors, but the most critical one was their inability to manage and control their consumption/population growth and eventually destroying their island(s) leading to collapse of their societies. Diamond draws, sometimes too annoyingly, a parallel between those islands and our planet, asking the reader to imagine what if we're mistreating Earth exactly the way Easter island inhabitants have mistreated their island.    The last chapter of the book (Part 4) has an interesting part where the author answers some of the most obvious questions the reader may have, he certainly got me there. Did you know that our planet can't even support the current Chinese population if they all start consuming like Americans do today?     Oh, and I'll never be looking down at agriculture again.

B000002TYX|4.0|Well, before I go into an description of Anthology 1, I must say:  When I want to consider buying something, I read the \\"1 Star\\" reviews first. I want to see what people dislike about the product. I read the 1 star reviews for Anthology 1 & 2, and I found a very disturbing one about 2. It said that the Beatles were terrible, and thought they got too much credit. Well, the first thing I thought was: was the anthology the only thing you listened too? Because you can't make a good judgement if you have not listened to their actual records! Geez, how people jump right into an idea, and never come out.  The next 1 star review I read was about #1, and it complained about the poor quality of some of the songs, perticually the first couple on the 1st disk. I thought then: Well, of course it's bad quality because they made the early songs under bad recording devices! Once again the ingnorance of some people. I think ofr any Beatles fan the anthology would be a good addition to your collection. It has a lot of early stuff, not seen before. Also on the second disk includes different takes of the songs through Beatles For Sale, and live recordings.  You will also find interesting little speeches by the band, and others.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|As per usual excellent HBO standards, this series just simply rocks!  Good acting, well written, sex all over the screen, interesting characters, beautifully photographed.  Loved it.  Cannot wait for ongoing episodes.

1416575464|5.0|This book is incredible!  There is a guide on every type of furniture, paint colors, different styles, and just about everything design-related you can think of.  There are so many different styles represented and many rooms that show a blend of different styles to give the reader a good vision of what goes together, why, and what does not.  My favorite part of this book is the little glimpse into a certain room which includes that the inspiration was, what pieces the person already had and wanted to use, and then what they bought to add and why.  I am only in college right now, but I dream all the time of my first place when I can actually own my own place instead of renting.  This book will come in very handy when that day comes, but until then I love looking at it and marking pages to add to my inspiration folder!
B00002EPJH|5.0|At the time he made this recording, pianist Keith Jarrett had been quite seriously ill (chronic fatigue syndrome) for more than a year, and pretty well out of circulation in regard to recordings and live performances. During his illness, however, he did not abandon music; in fact, one of his projects was to make this recording in his own home. Even if you disregard the physical and emotional duress under which this recording was made, it is an auspicious recording by virtue of its being the first solo recording of standards that Jarrett has ever released (he has recorded standards with his trio, but his solo outings have been either improvisations or classical compositions).<br /><br /> The performances captured on this CD are of the reflective, dreamy kind--no piano-pounding workouts this time around. But by reflective and dreamy, I do not mean wispy or uncommitted; indeed, these are passionate performances, but reflective of an inward rather than outward radiance and fire.<br /><br /> There is also not much of his humming or groaning (yes, there is some, but not nearly as much as on some of his previous recordings), so those who have been put off in the past by Jarrett's impromptu sound effects have little to fear. The piano sound is rich and full, and combined with the warm emotional feeling of the performances, the overall result is a richly rewarding musical experience.<br /><br /> My special favorites on this disk are his versions of \\"I Loves You Porgy,\\" \\"Someone to Watch Over Me,\\" and \\"Shenandoah,\\" but I can honestly say there is not a weak cut on the whole CD. This is music that is familiar, tender, fresh, moving, rewarding, and timeless in its appeal to the heart. Little surprise, then, that Jarrett dedicated the recording to his wife, with the tender words, \\"For Rose Anne/Who heard the music/Then gave it back to me.\\" That love comes through the music, and it is beautiful to behold. My appreciation goes out to Keith Jarrett and Manfred Eicher for being willing to share something so intimate yet so universal with us all.g so intimate yet so universal with us all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am twenty years old and work out about five times a week.  I am in shape and just love a change in my routine.  I love doing this workout two to three times a week.  It really gets your heart pumping and gives you results without taking too much time.  One warning, you must be able to push yourself.  I do modify some of the moves because I do not have a lot of upper arm strength, but other than that I do not have any problems.  I have only done the first two levels because I am scared of the third, but I will probably move up soon.  I have done it with friends who are trying to lose weight, and they really like it, although it is not easy.  I really like the organization of the workouts with the 3-2-1 principle.  You know exactly what you're in for and can tell yourself \\"just a little longer and you'll be done.\\"  I love Jillian and all of the workouts of hers I've tried.  This one definitely was not a disappointment and fits in nicely with my workout DVD collection!

0385340540|3.0|Grisham's prose is spare and succinct, so the pace isn't really that slow, but nothing much happens in this book. If I hadn't been to Italy and consequently been mildly interested in the descriptions of Italian cities and customs, I wouldn't have finished the book.  I kept hoping for a neat plot twist at the end, but it was pretty pedestrian. To top it off, Grisham added a note at the end admitting that he knows very little about spy satellites, computers, or the other techie stuff he included.  Clearly, his heart wasn't in writing this one. I tend to agree with the other readers who speculate he needed a way to write off his Italian vacation.

0440178002|4.0|This book was a very worthwhile read, almost worthy of a 5 star rating.  There are two reasons for a 4 star rating: one, there are parts of the book that are slow (although I guess that's to be expected in a 1,000 page novel!); second, the ending is just not good enough for such a great book.  There's just so much detail in the first 990 pages that the ending seems rushed - almost as if Clavell or his author decided that the book simply had to be less than 1,000 pages and they couldn't cut from anywhere else.  With all that said, I am glad that I read the book and I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys fiction.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I must say after pregnancy, marriage, I've allowed myself to get complacent in life and before the big 3-0 I've vowed to get back in shape for myself and my family. I just recently ordered this dvd and all I have to say is that my muscles are being worked. Jillian Michaels does not play and with the repetitive routines you would think that it would be boring or that you would'nt benefit from it, but so wrong. I love the fact that she has both her asisstance showing you two forms of variations for those that are beginners and for the advanced. Looking forward to the transformation.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|It's okay but, it's not very good.  It's just okay, I watched the whole season in one sitting cause I felt that I needed to finish it.  Paid almost $40 for the set.    If you like okay B movies than you'll like this series.  I can't say that I didn't like it, but it's something I wished that I had rented first before buying.    Quite a few of the characters are very easy to guess, you'll see when you watch it.  I figured the whole plot and characters within the first two episodes.  Which just made the other ten a bit forced to watch, cause once again, cause I bought the whole season.    Enjoy.
B001CDLATE|4.0|Initially bought the movie simply to enjoy the BluRay picture, but the film turned out to be amazing as well.  The time spent to capture this footage baffles me...  a beautiful film of the world and how we fit in with it.

B001AEF6C2|4.0|I hadn't seen this flick in almost 20 years. I loved it then, and love it now. It's funny. It sets out to do what John Hugh's wanted to do -- entertain and make you laugh. I bought this simply because I am adding all the big 80's movies to my collection. This has some of the most memorable quotes from any of the 80's flicks. And has one of Bill Paxton's most remembered roles.
0060765380|5.0|I've never read Rollins before but now I'm a fan.  This book was fantastic but you have to understand what it is.  It's like the summer movie of books: over the top characters, lots of action, a good premise, and some twists and turns along the way.  If that's the kind of book you want to read then this is the book for you.  If you're looking for something realistic and thought provoking and intellectually chanllenging then you have to look elsewhere.  This book is about fun, plain and simple.  It's a great escape.
1402756399|5.0|I was surprised by the large size of the book.  Very professionally done and lots of pictures.  I have not finished the 500+ page book yet but will eventually.  I was hoping there would be more about the actual Beagle voyage, but I believe there are other books on that subject.
0061231401|5.0|I'm always staggered by how James Rollins manages to come up with such compelling storylines. Once again, he's to blame for a lost night's sleep.

This book is a fascinating read and easy to understand for the non-scientist, I even found it suspenseful and hard to put down.  I only gave this four stars instead of five since I would have liked to see more documentation. But besides that, I definitely recommend this book!
0307408833|2.0|I was excited to get this book because not only did I want to eat healthy and indulge in baked goods, the pictures inside and the layout of the book are lovely and inspiring! However, I have already tried 3 recipes and only one turned out well. I tried the apple toastie, chocolate cupcakes (used a different frosting recipe), and chocolate chip cookies. For the toastie, I couldn't find a 7x4x3 pan, so I had to use my 9x5. The batter almost overflowed! When it was done, even though the toothpick test came out clean, it was too moist for my liking. The cupcakes came out very dry. The cookies, however, were delicious! But, do NOT lick the batter! Overall, this was very disappointing because I've never had trouble like this with other cookbooks, and I don't want to waste any more resources (i.e. expensive ingredients and time).

061891868X|5.0|With due respect to his other books, frankly, the plain-speaking nature of this one makes it Smolin's best.<br /><br />Amazon says people who have this also have or read:<br /><br />  Not Even Wrong - Peter Woit<br /><br />  Three Roads to Quantum Gravity - Lee Smolin<br /><br />  The Road to Reality - Roger Penrose<br /><br />  Warped Passages - Lisa Randall<br /><br />  The Elegant Universe Brian Greene<br /><br />And I've certainly read all these. I own the ones that are less string-y - smolin's books, woit's book and Road to Reality among others by penrose. Of the stringy books I thought Greene's was fine and was not fond of Lisa Randall's (it felt too booster-y in places).<br /><br />In that context, I didn't see at first the relevance of the sociology/philosophy of science/epistomology stuff, but then again, it's a big deal now especially w/r/t the landscape and it's a good idea to see that it can cut both ways.<br /><br />I note two other things - even if the book's gotten ad hominem reviews, most of them were decent ratings for a controversial book, and also, the book's not an attack on strings but a request to stop, look around, and evaluate the future of physics in an era where the money demands have gone up, the money's gone down, the jobs have gone down, the dominant paradigm (string/brane/M theory) is spinning its wheels, and particle physics data is harder than ever to acquire.

B001TN1EBG|5.0|William's album \\"The Sparrow & the Crow\\" is as raw & dark as it gets. Every emotion is touched as he tells the tragic story of his unsuccessful relationship. The music is pure & heartfelt, and his voice is soft, yet firm; perfectly accompanying his guitar and at times the piano. The story is heartbreaking, however you're still left with a smidgen of hope & a feeling that there's light at the end of the tunnel after listening to it.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|I'll be brutally honest.  With the exception of the song `Goliath', I hated the Grammy award winning previous album, `The Bedlam in Goliath'.  I was even a bit iffy with the `Amputechture' album, but `Bedlam' actually made it more tolerable than before.  I had almost given up on The Mars Volta.  Then on a whim I look them up to see what they've been up to.  Turns out they have a new album coming out soon called `Octahedron'.  I then searched and found audio of the songs `With Twilight As My Guide' and `Since We've Been Wrong'.  WOW!  The Mars Volta had won me back.  This is some of their best work to date.  I feel like they decided to stop trying to do as much as they could within each and every single song (like with the previous album).  This album has all the substance one could ask for.  Defiantly up the with the likes of `Deloused in the Comatorium'.
1401216676|2.0|Alan Moore has long repudiated The Killing Joke. \\"I have to say it's not one of my favorite works. Pretty far from it, actually,\\" he says. \\"I thought that it was very, very nasty...Whereas in \\"The Killing Joke,\\" what you've got is a story about Batman and the Joker, and while it did draw interesting parallels between these two fictional characters, at the end of the day that's all they are, fictional characters. They're not even fictional characters that have any bearing on anyone you're likely to meet in reality.\\" That's essentially the problem from the author himself.    In the beginning of the story, Batman goes down to Arkham Asylum to have a personal heart-to-heart chat with the Joker. Only it isn't the Joker he quickly discovers. He would have shown the impostor the kind of brute justice the real Joker and like minds would appreciate if not for Gordon's intervention. The message is obvious: Bruce Wayne is completely nuts. Brutal interrogations of the same sort are repeated by the Joker upon the Gordon family and if the parallel of madness wasn't clear to you before, make no mistake that all the Joker's dialogue to Batman will be about how crazy he is in case you somehow need more confirmation on the story's theme. It's a winning formula but you want more.    To actually say it has a plot is something of an overstatement really. For all the emphasis on adult material present, you can probably start reading at the halfway point without suffering any loss in coherence. As a result it feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon than anything else. I think maybe that's going a bit too far even since Saturday morning cartoons can be quite charming at multiple viewings no matter your age.    But don't get the wrong idea. The Killing Joke is fun to read the first time. Brian Bolland's artwork is superb save the atrocious Batmobile design next to some of the more typical comic book character designs like the Joker's chin and his freak posse lacking the exquisite splendor of other artists and the coloration is great. The Joker's dialogue during his attack on Barbara Gordon reminded me of the cruelly appealing magic trick in The Dark Knight and he is a spectacular character to observe from beginning to end. His origin story is later revealed to be possibly farcical but that doesn't make it any less terrifying if only because he could simply imagine such a horrible scenario for himself. His later attacks on Batman and Jim Gordon are much alike the tyranny wrought in that movie too, nevertheless on a much lesser scale here. Unfortunately, that's part of the problem.    What this comic book amounts to is very little. The Joker attacks the Gordon family, Batman rushes in and saves the day. There's plenty of killings and torture abound but so what? Jim Gordon's dialogue after being saved by Batman is too quick and too sane despite what he went through, almost to the point of Pollyanna-styled goodness. Alan Moore's intent for this as a non-canon entry in the Batman saga cements the inconsequential feel of the story since after reading this, there's no doubt it was dark but at the end of the day it just feels like nothing mattered. Barbara Gordon was not to become scarred from the Joker's attack in the ongoing Batman saga, that was just some editing done by the folks at DC Comics to canonize this story against the author's intent past its publication. That something so important in her life happened in such an irrelevant story nevertheless adds to the comic's mythic reputation. The reputation may be one of The Killing Joke's greatest strengths which when discussing a comic considered one of the greatest Batman stories by one of the most acclaimed comic book authors ever to live is inexcusable.     Looking back on it all, I can't see what the point of The Killing Joke actually is. The parallel between Batman and his enemies has been done before and even if it wasn't, why should that message alone excuse fluff in the form of violence? Bettercomics have been done before in the form of Preacher, The Sandman, and Watchmen while containing far more both narrative-wise and thematically angled too.    Kierkegaard said about love and charity that what matters most is that people should be merciful. You can be rich and give out a lot in aid but if you're not merciful when you do good, then people are simply being distracted by style over substance and not focusing on the real core of the issue, which is that people should be merciful to each other without succumbing to vanity through good works. In like manner, when people read this book they'll be floored by the violence. But all that violence is just a shoddy paint job that peels quick to show how this book's core is a case of two little kids squabbling, \\"I know you are but what am I?\\" over and over again.
0553818279|5.0|After seeing the excellent movies, \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" I decided to give one of Mr. Lehane's books a shot. \\"Shutter Island\\" is nothing less than outstanding. The story is intelligent, fast-paced and gripping as hell. It is extremely rare for me to be completely enthralled by a work of fiction. Mr. Lehane's work certainly did the trick. The author has a knack for teasing out just the right amount of suspense and mystery to keep the reader hooked. The tension of being stranded on the island kept building to the point of claustrophobia. The characters seem very plausible and the ending was a complete surprise. A truly wonderful read.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|If you like his other movies,,, you will like this one too.  Funny, cool, exciting movie.  Typical,, good actors.  Gerard is a definite bonus.
B000067J1H|4.0|The illusion of reality appeals to me, which is why I so thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  And what appears to be real in the chaotic world of Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is anything but, which makes FIGHT CLUB so much fun to watch.  Norton's character is being duped, even though Norton's character is convinced he's on some bizarre road to enlightenment--the vehicle being a \\"fight club\\" where anarchy rules the day.  And the catalyst to said enlightenment is Norton's unique friend Tyler (Brad Pitt is terrific), who of course is the unnamed protagonist's alter-ego (the articulate and ingenious invisible friend we all have).<br /><br />As the fight club reaches iconic underground status, as the anarchy becomes even more unsettling and bizarre, as the two main characters prattle about in an abandoned, dilapidated, disgusting house, I find myself keenly intent, looking for answers to more questions than I can count.  FIGHT CLUB is clever, grotesque, insightful, often funny, yet as it builds towards its inevitable over-the-top ending it starts to get so silly it gets in its own way.  Helena Bonham Carter as a gothic nonconformist girlfriend fits right in, and even Meat Loaf swings a pudgy arm in metaphorical tribute to this delightfully quirky film.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
1416550542|5.0|I loved this book!  It is a great mystery and the characters are wonderfully portrayed.  I couldn't put it down and cannot wait to read more from this author.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|What a movie, that's the first thing I thought when it was done.  Something about French \\"horror\\" films just really gets to me, I think its mainly the fact that most of it could happen.  I mean more than likely we wont have a zombie attack, or a giant monster running through the streets, but movies like \\"Martyrs\\" could very well happen.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end of \\"Martyrs\\" your treated to an all out blood bath, from shootings to cutting, etc you get it all...very nice and very graphic.<br /><br />The movie its self is great, its got a really creepy atmosphere, and the subject matter it pretty involved (meaning its not just a hack and slash teenage horror film)  You actually feel for the characters, and the twists and turns are very nice and unexpected.<br /><br />All and all this is a great film, with an awesome story!  I wasn't disappointed and if your into suspense/foreign horror, you will love this one!
B001EAWMGA|2.0|the box blurb says \\" Beowulf meets Predator \\"and that's basically what you get. I watched the entire movie, so it's not bad; it's just not that good. If the writers had altered a few basic points this would be a great film; for instance if the monster appeared to be even a tad sentient, the entire plot would become heavier. Also, The monster is too large, basically. This basic fact spoils most monster stories. The story plods along pretty well. The monster waits patiently while the characters develop their interactions and slight storyline. The ending is predictable and broadcast weakly, but it's still enjoyable.<br />It feels like the original story was going to explain the Beowulf myth by interjecting aliens; but that possibility gets lost along the way. Nothing to be ashamed of here. The Viking designs are adequate; the acting is adequate.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Simply put, the depth in these songs and how the songs are put together is the best on this album compared to their others.
B0002HWQEE|5.0|Among all the ride-ons and battery-powered toys at my granddaughter's first birthday party, this was the biggest hit.  When it arrived, I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected (even though I'd read the description), but it was the perfect size for a 1-year-old -- and very popular with her older toddler cousins, as well.  It ended up covered with cake frosting and ice cream, but we stuck it under the faucet and it looked as good as ever.  A really nice, simple toy!
1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson finds out the Greek/Roman myths about Zeus, Athena, Poseiden, etc are true stories, and not only that, but his father is one of those gods, making him half god, half human.  The books follow Percy on fast paced adventures escaping monsters, completing quests, and learning about himself and the mythical world.  The series is written for the middle school age boy or girl.  I'm an adult and read it anyway and I enjoyed it.  The books are fast reads and kept me entertained.
B00005JLCI|4.0|What else can one say? This is THE Hamlet of our times. Each age has its own image of Hamlet. Its dubious claim to authenticity (hence unusually long run time) aside, Branagh's Hamlet shines through its cinematography, superb sound track, and the cast's grasp of Shakespeare's lines (not least Kenneth Branagh, Julie Christie, and Kate Winslet). Compared to Mel Gibson's version which exudes an air of trying too hard, this four-hour film is in fact a pleasant treat. Highly recommended.
B001N26GFM|4.0|I give props to any film that delves into the places few others go, and this one does just that.  Despite eight-year-old Bruno's seemingly neverending naïvet&eacute; about the world around him, but specifically, The Fatherland, this drama explores the holocaust, war, and dubious parental morality from the perspective of a child.  The acting is superb, particularly, Farmiga, Thewlis, and Butterfield, and the cinematography is lovely.  My issues with the film were technical, in that I found it bothersome that everyone in the film had British accents, which did sensually detract from the authenticity of the subject matter.  Though it did drag in a few places and could have been shorter as a result, the film manages to bring a new approach to material that is already emotionally charged. The film's perspective actually did break the wall in a manner of speaking, as at one point in the film it switched from what had been Bruno's perspective to a split second of Shmuel's observation, a distraction more than a disruption.  For its ability to personalize the horrors of WWII this film is worth seeing.
0385339100|3.0|This is a well-crafted suspenseful legal thriller, tempting you to devour it in one sitting. Each page turned reveals unexpected twists. But would this novel live up to the test of time? There is the inevitable question of what is left after the suspense is over? Once you finish the novel and know the ending, would you go back to it again and again and savor it like a bottle of fine wine?
B000YENUI6|4.0|This film is definitely adults-only.  While the overall ambiance is violent, several gruesome scenes leave little or nothing to the imagination.  Given the role of organized crime that is to be expected, though in a few scenes graphic gore was gratuitous.  In those instances the plot could have been as strong or stronger left to wilder imaginings.  From the vantage point of the Russian mob (Vory), this film presents a shadier side of London, which is very artfully done without using any of its typically associated shtick.  There is no polite reserve or refinement in the lives of these characters.  What is presented is a very bare, bleak existence that without geographical reference could easily have been a grey eastern land.  No one character stood out, thus no performance stood out.  Rather, the fluid chemistry amongst the cast created this believable world, part of it intent on resolving a mystery as furiously as the rest of it focused on hiding clues.<br /><br />The one thing that I felt this film suffered was the absence of history connecting Nikolai to the Vory.  The omission doesn't detract from the plot resolution or from Nikolai's development as a character, though a mere two lines would suffice to tie him more thoroughly into the family and generate more sympathy for his plight.  As it stood his involvement was vague and confusing, which definitely took away from the rest of the well-crafted story.  All-in-all this film carries itself well, just expect to have lingering questions in the end.
B000JLTRKE|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A much different film than many people feared it would be when they heard Oliver Stone was attached, World Trade Center is not great in scope or ambition but in telling the small story of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno it is an unqualified success; 25 years from now when there have been many more films made about 9/11 this one may not be well-remembered, but it achieves what it sets out to do.    3/4
0312945973|3.0|The story line of this book is ok, but the author does go into very long elaborations of details (which I am not crazy about).  The book itself, however, is falling apart.  As you turn the page, it falls out of the book.

B0024F08UG|5.0|I saw this movie when I was just 16 in 1974.  It made a big impression on me then - that such a big, exciting movie could even be made.  Now - in 2009 - we get the first hi-def home video version of this film on Blu-ray disc.  Let me just say - Fox did a great job!  The detail is all there - along with the brilliant 70s colors (check out Fred Astaire's taxi near the beginning for super solid yellow), and, of course, the great John Williams score.  All of the extras from the DVD special edition have been ported over as well.  Fans of this movie should be ecstatic with this new edition.<br /><br />Sure, the movie is dated, somewhat overlong, and the acting a bit wooden - but as shear spectacle (and 70s kitsch) - it kept this viewer interested.  Another thing that is very refreshing - real models for the special effects work.  Some of these models were built 70 feet high in order to ensure realism.  If this movie were remade today - I'm afraid it would suffer from overuse of CGI effects (such as in the recent _Poseidon_.)<br /><br />One other note - the opening menu on the Blu-ray disc is not to be missed.  Someone worked really hard on creating a menu that honors the film.  Let the disc spin up naturally without clicking ahead.  A very nice touch.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Released in the same year as  Déjà Vu, Young's landmark reunion album with former Buffalo Springfield collaborator Steven Stills, David Crosby and Graham Nash, After the Gold Rush understandably focused on Young's solo compositions and idiosyncratic vocal style. Although it always had a slightly hastily put together quality, as if Young were rushing to his next assignment with Stills, it was highly successful at the time both commercially and artistically, and has aged extremely well. In fact, along with Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, which had a more rock orientation and which also produced the classic \\"Down by the River,\\" After the Gold Rush is arguably young's best overall album, blending rock-tinged songs like \\"Southern Man,\\" basically a one off on \\"Down by the River,\\" with lovely ballads such as \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart,\\" and \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\".    Like all the recent Neil Young reissues, this has benefited immensely from the remastering to HDCD sound. Unlike some remastering efforts these days, which tend to be aggressive and edgy, this one has made the sound more \\"musical and mellow while at the same time restoring the dynamic impact of Young's forceful guitar strumming and twangy lead guitar playing. In other words, it sounds about as close as a CD can come to sounding like an vinyl LP, without the clicks and pops of course. This reissue is long overdue, and it's great to finally hear it again with all the force and mastery of the original.
0312370849|5.0|This book brought me back to reality and really made me appreciate all that I have. I have never cried so hard while reading a book. This one really struck a cord with me. The things that people went through during the Holocaust are so unbelievable, yet it happened. And not that long ago. It was indeed a VERY sad book. My husband asks me why I read such things. The only thing I can answer to that is it's real and I along with many more I am sure do not want to forget. And sometimes I need that reminder telling me how lucky my family and I are.
006112429X|5.0|Wow. This book - structured in letters from a wife to her husband - was excellent, absolutely stunning. It was completely absorbing and I could not put it down - I read it one sitting. Probably \\"enjoy\\" would be the wrong word to apply to the reading experience, but it was certainly gripping, emotional and riveting. So, in that way, I enjoyed reading it. The topic of extreme violence in a school  was handled with a lot more skill and sensitivity here than  in the similarly themed book, Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult. I was shocked by the ending and completely hooked from page one. After putting it down, this unsettling story lingered in my mind. I will certainly be keeping an eye out for more books by this talented author as well.
0743454537|5.0|The book was in great condition & I received it a lot sooner than what I expected! It was a great deal & a great read! :)
0786838655|5.0|This series of books is FANTASTIC! My ten year old son loves these books. He is currently reading book 3 in the series and he can't wait to get the next one each week. I cannot say enough good things about these books. FYI, if you are going on a long trip they are great to get on CD for the ride. They keep kids and adults entertained.
6303482295|3.0|Even though I knew this was a VHS tape and it was 15 years old, It felt like I was watching a movie made in the 1970's. I found it to be more like a history lesson than a travel video. For the price it was an ok video but would have enjoyed more travel / tourist advice instead of documentary of the city.
B00138GY0I|5.0|Absolutely incredible that nobody notice how dangerously in pain Michael was. Yeah, it's hard to understand his words when he sings but now that I've been reading many of his lyrics it was crystal clear that he needed big time help. Morphine, They don't care about us, Ghost, Privacy,  just to name a few.  UNIQUE talent. Michael, I love you more.  MANY have your blood on their hands.
0743298039|3.0|This book was neither wonderful or awful.  It was interesting and I wanted to know where it was going.  However, I found myself asking why the story went in the direction it did more than finding it a \\"shocking twist'.  Its a fast read and engaging enough.  Take it to the beach or on a plane.  I finished it yesterday and am still indifferent about the whole thing.  All in all, give it a go if you are stuck.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I love the Star Trek universe.  I'm a huge fan of Next Generation and DS9 (my two favorites) and grew up watching the original show as often as I could (I was a little kid, watching reruns in the late 70s).  This series takes just a little getting into, at first site of Archer, you'll think \\"There's the Quantum Leap guy!\\", but that identy quickly fades and he really does a fine job as a Star Trek captain.    If you can get through the first half of the first season, things really start falling into place.  From then on, it's a fun ride and a great insight into Vulcans and the start of the Ferderation.  Give this a try, and you'll find this as enjoyable as any Star Trek series.  It really makes me sad that it only lasted four seasons.  I could have kept on watching this for many more.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Firstly,I am a Fan I suppose and have been throughout the Years. Not an Over the top fan --just enjoy some of Michael's songs along the way. I bought this DVD for my wife who is a bigger fan and thought she'd appreciate the DVD.   We watched this and From the JUMP-- WOW!!  For a 2 hour DVD-- it seemed like minutes.. it just Flew by and was probably one of the Best DVD concerts I have ever watched...and I have several.   Move the furniture and Make some room around you, because it is not possible to just sit and watch--You Will want to move...have the Audio run through surround sound if possible.    Back to the DVD ...From beginning to end.. the song selection even for the Not so faithful fan like myself are all recognizable and done extremely well with the show sets enhancing the performances. I plan on watching this DVD Several more times. I cannot imagine this ever getting tired. I truly suggest owning this DVD to anyone who likes even just some of the tracks, but as I said early on-- It will have you from the opening note of JAM and not let you go. Enjoy!! hope this review helps you if you are on the fence.
B001EO748M|5.0|Season two continues the stories introduced in season one, Henry's desperation for a son increases creating tensions and increasing problems.  The English Reformation is in full swing forcing the nation into following the King away from Rome.  The King, the Boleyn and the court, is paying the bills for choices made during season one.  Loyalties are tested and caution is needed.<br />This season has some very strong acting and story lines.  The Boleyn family is in power but starting to worry that the King's favor may change.  Te King is forced to confront the unexpected ramifications of his decisions.  Trapped, he is unable to do as he wishes forced into action that extracts a high personal cost.  This season has less nudity, more politics and better performances from an excellent cast.  The Tudors is a hit, it may not be \\"real history\\" but it is very entertaining and enjoyable!
B00006JDSI|5.0|This version of Nosferatu is the ULTIMATE vampire movie, it is still amazing and quite a special movie.    The story also differs in many points from the Stoker story, principally in the depiction of the count and the death of the vampire, so I don't quite understand how they lost the lawsuit with Stoker's widow, which called for the destruction of all copies of the film. Luckily for us, this never was done effectively and enough copies survived to guarantee the existence of this masterpiece.    It starts when the town's greedy real estate manager, played exquisitely by Alexander Granach, who was very talented at depicting creeps and had a long carrer in these roles, actually shows up many years later in Garbo's \\"Ninotchka\\" playing one, receives a letter from Count Orlock. The letter itself is a manuscript covered with magical signs, and the expression on his face becomes so horrid that one just knows this is bad news, yet he manages to convince his younger employee, Gustav von Wangenheim as Thomas Hutter of the power of Location, Location, Location and convinces him to take the trip for the purpose of selling the Count the deserted huge house across the street.    One of the best features of the film, is the fact that it was filmed on location, through not as commonly believed, in Transylvannia. The castle depicted, Orava Castle,  does exist and is in Slovakia, it is terrifying enough, and I for one would not go there, even under bright sunlight. The mountain range so beautifully depicted in the tainted bluish tones are not the Carpathian mopuntains but the High Tatras, located between Slovakia and Poland, but they  manage just as well to convey the air of mystery and ominous danger.   You have to have the silly optimism and natural idiocy of the real estate agent Hutter to not notice the obvious signs of doom in the reaction of the people in the tavern, and particularly the coachmen, that leave him at the crossing of a bridge into the Count's estate. Soon anothercarriage picks him up, this is the scariest ride imaginable, yet Hutter doesn't quite catch on, with the horses completely covered in cloth and the expression of the coachman intensely deranged.     This Count Orlock as played by Max Schreck (this last name means \\"terror\\" in German, but it was pure coincidence, not an invention for the movie) is a scary, creepy, repulsive creature. No sex appeal or suave moves here, and though he has a certain aristocratic demeanor, very evident when he first meets Hutter, he is still just a monster looking for the next blood-feed. He does have magical powers though,  as he can, for example, get in and out of his coffin without moving the lid. His own shadow is like another character in the film, so intense is its evil reflection either on walls or victims.This vampire is still scary and quiet creepy after all these years and seeing so many other creations and variations on this theme, not an easy feat to accomplish given the popularity of this subject.  The film can seem long, because a lot of the effects depend on the time SEQUENCE itself, I found this out later when reading about the film, specifically that the director used a metronome to measure time, but while viewing it I must confess I was impatient at times.    Even after being bitten by the vampire in the night, Hutter can not make himself believe that this is happening and goes off to write his bride that the mosquitoes had done it. Never understimate the power of denial. Nevertheless he eats so well in the castle that he is able to recover and escape from his tower room and down the mountains before he faints and is luckily found be a good Samaritan that brings him to a hospital, where he recovers and hurries home.    He had seen the Count prepairing for a voyage and is afraid he will get to the town before he does. Next thing we know the Count's coffins are going down a river,he actually needs several to carry the accursed earth of the plague with him, rats included, that he finds most comforting to sleep with. The river is actually the  Vah, also in Slovakia, the scenes of the harbor and the town are from Lubeck and Wisborg, small towns  in Germany.     The ship takes the cargo in and soon enough the sailors start to die, one by one. They think it's the plague, but of course it's the Count feeding. He timed it perfectly so that when the very last man dies he has arrived.   The drawback is that he has to carry his own coffin into the house he purchased back in his castle. The scene is suppossed to be at night so understandably, he meets no one carrying it by himself, but I would have added a couple of magically conjured servants here, it was almost comical to watch the Count carry the coffin as if it were a package with his belongings. Coppola's Count would never have done such un-vampirical labor and neither would Belosi's impersonation. This is where I would have preferred to see the monster levitating from the ship and flying majestically in a brand new cape of velvet, preferably with some Eastern European Byzantine embroidery, or at least trailing a long one through the town square.    Greta Schroder as Ellen, is convincing in the role, but so unappealing I actually thought she was a man in drag in the first  scenes. As the innocent bride that is to marry Hutter, she has been 'feeling drawn to' walking in her nightgown on the balcony of her terrace, expressing 'longing' but whether is for the return of her boyfriend or the vampire himself is not clear. Upon Hutter's return she manages to read his vampire manual and discovers there that the only way to  kill the vampire is to have a young virgin distract him so much while he sucks the life out of her, that he may forget the sunrise and be destroyed by the light.  This information will help her save her town from the curse of the vampire in the last scene, which is pure magic.    This copy was excellent quality. I have heard others complain it was not so with copies they've seen, so there are many around and you have to make sure to get the KINO restored one.
0515141429|4.0|This is a great read.  I spent 32 hours reading it and I loved every moment of it.  It will keep you guessing to the very end. Jack Reacher is a phenomenal character. Lee Child really knows how to keep you (the reader) turning the pages.  I want to read all the Reacher novels.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|this new album is amazing even tho some of the guitar solos and bass licks sound a bit solen from other bands and musicians the new instrumental is good and all but its not as good as the call of ktulu or orion or to live is to die its a very good effort i love how they made this whole entire album i still respect metallica im awaiting the follow up to 2008s death magnetic im happy for this band i still wish jason didnt leave the band but he did and now robert trujillo is taking his place and is trying to fill jason shoes i gave this album 5 stars is because they try and they succed if you like mastodon korn slipknot dream theater slayer and megadeth etc etc etc youll love this album and this band i always have respect for metallica and will always will be giving this amazing band respect
055358894X|4.0|I purchased this book a few days ago and read it over a weekend. I must say, the story kept me turning pages wanting to know what happened next. It had everything I expected - thievery, lying, violence, betrayal, etc. While the way the story is put together does take away somewhat from the actual excitement of the plot (with flashbacks every other chapter to the main characters childhood), it does offer the reader the chance to learn a little more about the characters, thus giving them a better understanding of why they act the way they do, why they're better at one thing than another, etc. So it's almost like putting together a puzzle on the characters while seeing how they plot, scheme, etc. Overall, I recommend it. It's an entertaining book, if nothing else.
B00136JP92|4.0|My other review got deleted,so this ones going to be alittle shorter. Overall, I think this album is good, but I do think 3 of her other albums are alot better. Daydream, MusicBox, EMC2. I do think the record companies pressured her into being a bit more edgy.Because this was touted as Mariah's makeover. I agree with the reviewer from down below. It's very rememnsicent of janet jackson's velvet rope and Madonna's ray of light.I do think those two cds are alittle better. There's also an interesting youtube video on which she talks about Madonna's ray of light. It almost seems as if they  were waiting to see how successful the competition would be. Which i think are the last time those two artists really hit their creative peaks. I do remember MTV always playing this album's videos all the time, and this cd just screams 1997. It brings back good memories. ok,ok! Enough chit chat, lets talk about the songs! The roof, excellent track/video! Really good song. I also loved the 4thof july. I also think that Butterfly has to be one of best ballads of all time. It's truly mariah at her best. My All is an excellent video/song. But doesn't compare to butterfly to me! Honey is a great jam track that has a good club/rap feel to it. and i think it will stand the test of time. Overall, if your thinking about puchasing this cd do it!
B00104WHLA|1.0|Too bad the advertising was not more accurate.  The DVD format for the box set they advertise containing the Super Audio CD's (SACD's) had PAL-formatted DVD's.  A very important difference in the US as most players will not play the PAL-formatted DVD's and need the NTSC formatted discs.  What you need to order is UPC: 5099951968724.  If you have a 5.1 system, just buy the American release, it is all you will need as the DVD's are 5.1.
B00136Q2MA|4.0|Well, what can i say about the vocals on this album from Barbra Streisand? Their excellent. She truly is one of the greatest singers, I've ever heard. I was surprised in checking out her discography that most of 70's stuff is pop rock/disco material. Which made me like her alittle bit more. Guilty is a great relaxing track. And the bee gee's andy gibb does a great job on the duet. Woman in love and what kind of fool are good stresiand tracks! To me the rest of the material is good, but not her best. Overall, you should def. buy this album if you like 70's rock/disco and old school r and b! This def. a hidden gem froms stresiand and def. worth buying. I did find her previour two albums to be alittle better though.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|If you are hesistating about checking this TV show out -- stop and buy this DVD! This show is hilarious! It's perfect for 20 and 30-somethings, who are still in the process of trying to figure life out.<br />I recently just finished this first season and am currently in the process of watching the second season. This is one of the cheapest prices you'll find for this DVD and it is so worth it.<br />One of the funniest episodes is The Pinapple Incident... I don't want to spoil it, but it's definitely one of my favorites from the first season.<br />GREAT season, GREAT character, GREAT tv show!
B002AQTD2S|1.0|This is not the full book but the \\"cliff notes\\" version.  It was $0.99 for a reason.
B00284BMBM|5.0|If you liked the first album from Daughtry, you'll love this one.  There is not a weak track on the album...they're all REALLY good!
1423113497|3.0|I found this series to be very entertaining as did my children.  Not as good as the FableHaven series, but still good.
B000OJI7E8|5.0|The seller's remarks about the condition were spot on, it arrived when expected and the book is every bit as good as other readers have said.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Really?  What else needs to be said.  Obviously JarJar is annoying, and comes pretty close to ruining the movie, but who doesn't love Star Wars?
B0009UC7HA|5.0|I like previous reviewers have not read the book.  I can not comment on that perspective, but for me I really enjoyed this movie.  I missed it at the box office but caught it when on cable.  There are some unbelievable parts just like the bond movies but thats what makes it so much fun.  I loved the characters, the music, and the story.  I am sorry this didn't do well enough for them to make more films. I would recommend it to most everyone.<br /><br />Robyn Carter<br />Lexington, KY
0446402389|5.0|This is one of the best historical fiction thriller's I've read in a long time.  I had seen HBO's \\"Citizen X\\" years ago, but this debut novel is far better than anything I saw in that movie, and I thought the movie was great.<br /><br />The writing is flawless and the author makes you really feel like you're right there with all of the characters and the vivid picture he paints of life in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.  This is a real page turner, and a book I'll never forget.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!
B0027HOBM2|4.0|Five stars for the content and three stars for the Bluray version.    What I really like about season 2 is how the characters are explored.  In season 1 we learn about the high life of Don and company.  In season 2 they pull a layer off the characters and we learn more about their flaws and personalities.  It is really hard to stop watching the show.    As in Season 1, the photography and sets are fantastic.  Every detail is covered.  Season 2 includes some interesting twists and new characters.    The Bluray version of this is frustrating.  While the picture and sound are excellent, the disc is very slow and menus klunky.  Loading and playing the disc takes a couple of minutes (to get into the first episode).  This is on a new Panasonic player that is normally pretty quick.  Note to the producers -- we just want to see the show!    Get this Bluray set and enjoy it.  Excellent show, probably the best I have seen.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Reviewer: J S Scribner, WI  Another winner. Reacher is a lot of fun to ride along with. Not the best in the series, but still a most enjoyable read.
B0029LHWHM|5.0|Dawkins' brilliant book eviscerates the metaphysical pretensions of dogmatists--both Christian and Muslim--who cling to medieval obscurantism in a bid for worldly power. The God Delusion unveils the absurdities of the arguments for the existence of gods by showing how instead of honestly admitting we do not possess sufficient knowledge about the origin of the cosmos, we instead construct empty little exercises in sophistry to bolster bronze age fairy tales and the status quo traditions that bend them to their own ends, thus empowering the witch doctors of our time and place (e.g., the mullahs, priests, and televangelists).    The fact of the universe's existence is no more evidence for the existence of a god or gods than the sun's daily traversal across the sky was evidence of the sun god's chariot. All such fabrications without sufficient evidence demonstrate a human tendency to fill in the unknown with some false anthropomorphic hogwash designed to make us feel better about ourselves and puff up our importance. In fact, as Dawkins argues, the universe's evolution from simplicity toward complexity essentially rules out the existence of a god prior to the origin of the universe itself. Where did this god come from? Where is it now? And what hard evidence--not mere inferential \\"reasoning\\"--is there that supports the notion of its existence? None! It's all a matter of human tradition, discourse, and imagination. Theists imagine it's sufficient to sit in an armchair and read utterly ignorant bronze age spinners of superstition and medieval schoolmen who still believed the earth was the center of the universe in order to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. It's as intellectually honest and credible in our contemporary context as consulting entrails to augur the future.    In addition, Dawkins provides lucid arguments against: 1) the idea that \\"faith\\" (asserting something to be true that cannot be proven) is a virtue; 2) phony \\"morality\\" predicated upon metaphysics (which usually produces just the opposite--absolutist immorality); and 3) the brainwashing of children to believe in nonsense, which is how religion nefariously perpetuates itself. Dawkins' book is an exercise in consciousness raising that should help many throw off the last vestiges of medieval superstition that still plague this earth.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|I have a confession to make: I am 40-something years old, and I love the Harry Potter series. Well, not much of a confession, is it? In fact, as I looked around in the theater arena at the other patrons of this newly-released \\"young adult\\" blockbuster film, I noticed that the vast majority of them were at least my age and many older than me. And they did NOT have children with them. This alone speaks to the universality of theme that I had recognized myself long ago within the pages of this compelling story. It isn't just for children after all. Beyond any questions of the red herring of \\"witchcraft,\\" I have found this series to contain quintessential good vs. evil struggles that are presented in realistic fashion, that is, that the players are human (well, roughly anyway) and everyone has deep motivation and logic behind his or her actions. The tale is an expertly woven one. In the book, that is.<br /><br />I am lucky that I went into the viewing of this film having read the book first, although it has been a few years since I picked it up. Amazingly, the plot points and fabric floated back to me as if I had only just read it. After all, the Half-Blood Prince is my favorite character and this 6th volume my favorite book in the series.  So, why then is there only a tentative thread of curiosity into who the Half-Blood Prince is? I found the dramatic intensity of the books' scenes dampened here and in other ways. I have heard other reviewers call the film \\"leisurely\\" and harp about all the snogging that goes on. Sure, there is snogging in the book, but there is so much more. I figure we could have done with some of the backstory of the Prince's early life to tie the reminscences of Horace Slughorn for his star pupil Lily Evans together in a suggestive way that would give us more insight into what was going on. Perhaps cut off one of the many, MANY shots of Malfoy looking serious, Malfoy looking worried, Malfoy looking distraught...well, you get the idea.<br /><br />For all that, I found the snogging scenes pretty well done and Lavender Brown suitably overblown and awful, complete with her purring of \\"Won Won\\" to a horrified Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint played the man in the lovers' snare to perfection here). Hermione, too, was real \\"heart on your sleeve\\" when it came to the lovers' game as well and her unwanted suitor McClaggen was pretty good, but I think Lavender takes the cake. Both Grint and Watson were the picture of young, complicated, emotional \\"love.\\") Radcliffe's Potter, however, seemed rather preoccupied and I got none of the feeling that he wanted to pummel Ginny's suitors into the earth as noted in the book. I can see, however, why this is downplayed, since Harry has so much more to worry about. Potter stands upon a knife-edge at this point, and I think Radcliffe played it passing well, coming off as somewhat overwhelmed but well over his own adolescent sufferings as seen in \\"Order of the Phoenix.\\"<br /><br />Many of the plot points were condensed or modified to tell a leaner story; for instance, Malfoy's grand scheme with the vanishing cabinets entails a mass invasion by many Death Eaters in the book. All the Order of the Phoenix members are fighting in the halls and up the stairs to the Astronomy Tower. In the movie, there are only four people, and it is a quiet, personal affair. No one knows what happened until it is all over. The denouement in the Astronomy Tower seems somehow constricted, like it is even physically blocked by the set itself without the clear, circular space from the book; the good, weakened, facing the bad, in great numbers, waiting for Malfoy to perform. Only when Snape steps in finally does the scene converge with memory. Overall, I got the feeling of an ill-blocked scene, as Harry was completely out of the place I envisioned from the setup in the book. In print it was compelling, thrilling, with the Dark Mark over Hogwarts seen from Hogsmeade, urging our heroes to respond to Malfoy's action. Inthe movie, all this is blurred and the Dark Mark appears only after all is said and done, as if it is a dramatic recapitulation rather than mad melee challenge. In the end, the quiet tone works well enough, the intimate coup, rather than the overrunning of noisy and haphazard Dark Wizards. It must have been easier to follow for those who have not read the book.<br /><br />I did feel that there was not enough staff consternation and reaction to the shocking role of Professor Snape, and his final interaction with Harry was also somewhat muffled, the dramatic intensity lessened from the breathless narrative in the book. But, perhaps those of you who are aficionados of the movies without the influence of the books will find this review to be somewhat annoying (uh oh, it's another one of those \\"it's not as good as the books\\" reviews!). But the movie does have its own sort of internal consistency, and there are suggestive hints dropped throughout that will mean something to those who have read the books but will pass unnoticed to those who haven't.<br /><br />For instance, after Harry drinks the Felix Felicis potion and goes out the Gryffindor House portal to find Professor Slughorn, he says \\"Hi!\\" to someone he must have run into. In the book, Harry has bumped between Ginny and Dean Thomas and precipitated the breakup fight that will magically free up Ginny to become HIS girl in the end. Felicity, indeed! But that can't be told in a movie the way it can be told in print. Slughorn's recruitment by Dumbledore and Harry is also diluted by throwing out Harry's show of persuasive power for a less compelling motivation (\\"he wants to collect you, Harry\\".) Another is the very short appearance of Regulus Black (his photo, anyway), Sirius' brother, in a picture of Slughorn's that he is showing to Harry at the beginning. \\"I'd have liked to have the set,\\" he opines. What this means is lost on the audience, unless they know that Slughorn was the Master of Slytherin House in his days at Hogwarts, and he \\"had\\" Regulus but didn't have Sirius. This is because Sirius is in Gryffindor House, which might explain his Gryffindor friends, mightn't it? And watch for more on Regulus later, in the next thrilling installment.<br /><br />Anyway, overall, I found the movie enjoyable, except that, of course, it didn't focus quite so much on the second titular character. I did find enough to keep it together though; the underflow text that begins with Snape's vow with Narcissa and Bellatrix at the beginning is suggested throughout, even if it is often with one of rather too many meaningful glam shots of Malfoy looking put out. (Speaking of Malfoy, it looks as if Tom Felton has grown up rather too quickly; Malfoy looks like a cutthroat corporate exec already. I guess we could put it down to the stresses placed on him in this story. After all, this is really the first time the younger Malfoy gets to be part of the real meat of the story. (The elder Malfoy is only seen in various newspaper clippings that suggest not only disgrace but incarceration and general disfavor. Bad luck, Lucius!) Another shady, unexplained character is Fenrir Grayback, who is seen with Malfoy and Bellatrix several times and is part of the invading party, but somehow we're never let in on the fact that he's a werewolf, and what's more, that he's the very one who turned Remus Lupin into a werewolf when he was but 5 years old. And to top it all off, he's rather \\"into\\" turning young kids into werewolves. That would have added quite a lot of tension and thrill to the scene where he is pursuing Harry and Ginny outside the Weasley House (which I don't recall having burned down in the book.) One thing that seems to have fallen out ok, though, is the sense that Voldemort is everywhere but here. We are shown young Tom Riddle, whose portrayal by two young actors at different ages comes off as polite evil about to hatch out well enough. The shots of the ring on young Tom's hand and then in Dumbledore'soffice later is suggestive enough, but these books are becoming more complex as we reach the denouement, and I hardly think a single movie of just over 2-1/2 hours can encompass it all. It is no wonder the last installment has been split into two, or else it might end up as a series of blip images that mean something only to people like me who have devoured the books a few times each.<br /><br />Ok, so this isn't a tidy review, but perhaps you get the idea from it that it is a passably good film that has tidbits hidden in it that are only revealed properly if you've read the books. I must end up saying yes, the book is better than the movie, but, in the end, this is a feature of the medium. Books have all the time in the world to tell a detailed story, and the quickness of its telling is determined only by how fast you wish to turn the pages. I grow more and more to feel that the Harry Potter series is diminished if one only knows the films but they are still quite enjoyable as far as summer blockbusters go. Just prepare to be confused by many of the unexplained images and stuff that was left out in the translation of book to film.didn't have Sirius. This is because Sirius is in Gryffindor House, which might explain his Gryffindor friends, mightn't it? And watch for more on Regulus later, in the next thrilling installment.    Anyway, overall, I found the movie enjoyable, except that, of course, it didn't focus quite so much on the second titular character.

Ok, so this isn't a tidy review, but perhaps you get the idea from it that it is a passably good film that has tidbits hidden in it that are only revealed properly if you've read the books. I must end up saying yes, the book is better than the movie, but, in the end, this is a feature of the medium. Books have all the time in the world to tell a detailed story, and the quickness of its telling is determined only by how fast you wish to turn the pages. I grow more and more to feel that the Harry Potter series is diminished if one only knows the films but they are still quite enjoyable as far as summer blockbusters go. Just prepare to be confused by many of the unexplained images and stuff that was left out in the translation of book to film.
B00000K413|4.0|It is awfully hard to dismiss TFF's important debut amongst early electro-pop's greatest efforts. Coming through startlingly fresh still despite heavy doses of retro production and dated equipment, Hurting excels at taking the cold harsh textures of early electronica and fusing it with something far more melodically human.
1590171993|5.0|The unremarkable life of William Stoner from the time he enrols as a student of agriculture at the University of Missouri through his life long tenure as assistant professor of English Literature. On the way we read of his loveless marriage,how his wife uses his daughter as a weapon of spite against him, how his career is devastated over a point of principle he is doomed to lose,and how his one shot at happiness in a love affair with Katherine Driscoll is snatched from him due to university etiquette and politics. Yes! This is like an adaptation of a Leonard Cohen song! Tragedy all the way...<br /> But like Cohens songs, Stoner is beautifully crafted;the prose grip you to the page and the strong characterization makes what-by all accounts-should be weak story material one of the greatest books you are ever likely to read.<br /> The eulogies on rhe back cover by Irving Howe and Steve Almond talk of a beautiful and affecting book. More often than not you wonder what book the eulogists were reading compared to you, but in this instance Howe and Almond were definately reading the same novel. Stoner is a gem.
1573229725|5.0|This book was amazing. There were so many twists and turns that I was unable to put the book down and stayed up until two or three a.m. reading it. When it ended, I found myself wanting to know more about what happened to Sue and Maud. Instantly became one of my favorites books.
B001782N4A|2.0|I bought mine from an online Geek store rather than Amazon, but my complaint is the same as others. It does not light up as advertised, the dome does not spin, and the word \\"Demo\\" is printed on the front. For $32 I felt ripped off, and this cheaper mock-up is worth only half that. Works as a USB port, but if I just wanted a USB port I would have gotten one. I wanted the USB port that was a working R2 toy...unfortunately, the R2 hub you get is not the one advertised. Save your money.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood lives up to his persona as a tough guy in this movie.  He plays an ageing man in a changing neighborhood.  He challenges not only the gangsters, but also the establishment.  The movie is somewhat predictable but immensely enjoyable, with an unexpected ending.
B00192IV0O|2.0|I wasn't impressed at all by the first single off of The E.N.D., but I bought this because my oldest child loved the song, \\"Boom Boom Pow.\\"  It would be nice if it had come with a parental advisory label so I could have been prepared for the countless uses of various words that I don't want my kids hearing.  The PMRC, or whoever is responsible for coming up with warning labels, are so quick to label every other rap album for bad words, but for some reason if you're completely mainstream, you get a pass.    Warning to parents, they may make appearances on American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance, but the Black Eyed Peas' music is NOT for kids.
0671015206|4.0|Thomas Stanley and William Danko's bestselling book The Millionaire Next Door offers a truly fascinating look at the life of a typical millionaire in the United States. The two authors' years of studying, researching, and surveying America's affluent can be seen through the interesting observations and revealing statistics found in this book.<br /><br />Stanly and Danko reveal that most millionaires in America do not fit the typical 'rich person' stereotype. Instead of a Mercedes-driving, high-roller playboy with a Rolex watch, the typical American millionaire is more likely a middle-aged, married, small business owner with a full-sized American-made car.<br /><br />Each chapter expounds on one of the seven common denominators that the authors found among the affluent. Many of their statistics were surprising to me. For example: over 63% of millionaires buy their cars new instead of used. Also, 90% of millionaires have never spent $1000 on a new suit. Stanley and Danko make the key distinction between having a high income (e.g. your annual salary) and being wealthy (e.g. your savings and investments). More often than not, those who appear to be financially successful are actually not very wealthy, since those who are wealthy typically live well below their means.<br /><br />The authors also make the distinction between those that are or will become wealthy, whom they call PAWs (Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth), and those who are hyperconsumers that will likely never become wealthy, whom they call UAWs (Under Accumulators of Wealth). Throughout the book the authors give good bits of advice on how one can become a PAW rather than a UAW.<br /><br />Although this book was very interesting to read, I have a couple of small criticisms: First, the book feels kind of disorganized and unbalanced. For example, the section on what kind of cars millionaires drive seemed far too long, and the section on 'economic outpatient care' (wealthy parents giving money to their adult children) was rather repetitive. Second, this version was published in 1998, which makes it somewhat less relevant today, because it is so statistics-heavy (although there is still a lot of useful information). I think it would be great if the authors released an updated edition of this book.<br /><br />Overall, though, this book was fascinating to me, and highly recommended for anyone who seeks financial independence.e.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|\\"The holiday\\" is a sympathetic film that bets for your most beloved illusions and the ancestral wishes for watching how the fairy tales come true in this age of globalization. Two lonely and disappointed women will make a decisive twist of fate to their lives betting for a travel from U.K. to L.A. in order to make a sudden and decisive change of their affective lives.<br /><br />Until this point everything seems extremely predictable but the touch of originality given by her talented director, letting a secondary personage breaths and gives the story a persuasive \\"lesson of dignity\\". Arthur Abbot (Eli Wallach) is an old and \\"out of the game\\" script writer whose wise advises to our very young English girl (Kate Winslet) fits admirably. Plus, the presence of the charismatic Joe Black gives this film laughable freshness. On the other hand Cameron Diaz gives one of her prominent roles in years proving she is much more comedian instead dramatic actress, and the presence of Jude Law as a consecrated and full time devoted father, whose recent affective loss will not avoid he seduces this American girl, who really thinks she has dealt will all kind of situations.<br />At the end, a charming resolution will conclude with a soft smile in our minds and hearts.<br /><br />A summer breeze and romantic film free of violence and special effects (which by itself it sounds incredible at these times don't you?)

B001ILHY1I|4.0|\\"Death race\\" is a well conceived remake of the well known futurist film Death Race dated from 1975 and starred by David Carradine (followed of Deathsport).<br /><br />Because and despite of the predictability of the script there are thundering car chases  and hair raising hair sequences that will keep you at the border of your seat.<br /><br />Hennessey is a devilish commander and chief director of prison who really knows to deal with the green bucks entertaining the vast audience through Internet in 1912.<br /><br />Paul Henderson (supported by the clinical eye of Roger Corman) comes back with this one thousand plot of the good guy sent to prison due a supposed crime he never committed. A dark and sinister conspiracy is right behind because the show needs more blood to nourish the survey.<br /><br />The sharp comparison between the modern audiences and the great crowds in the Roman Empire remits to the most famous chariots race in the cinema. Because when \\"The machine\\" makes it appearance, Ben Hur comes immediately to our memory and these hopeless cons of today are just like these condemned to death gladiators in the Roman sand, fighting against lions or through endless and deadly combats all the way through still one of them wins.<br /><br />As is usual in this type of films you really should not worry about making use of six neurons of your brain. Just let the wings of the modern ad spectacular special effects squad makes it for you and as the reminded story tellers of the ancient times. There will be blood but at the end the justice will prevail.

B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|I'm still waiting for this band to find a producer that makes them perform to their potential.  All you need to do is listen to Magne F's \\"The Longest Night\\" and then the title track from this album to see how adept they are at sucking the passion out of their own music.  This band has been more influential than a lot of people know to bands like Coldplay, Keane, and U2; but a-ha have yet to manage to put out a consistent, strong record since their debut. I liked this record, but I am a rabid fan.  After listening to it, I know I'm not going to use this album in my argument to people unfamiliar with their work beyond \\"Take On Me\\" that they should listen to a-ha.  Sadly, Morten does his best work to date on this album, but it gets lost in mid-tempo pop songs that easily blend into any background.  This sounds like a better Morten Harket solo album than a solid outing from a band striving for arenas.
0385342020|5.0|I haved loved Kinsella's books, but actually paused when I read the synopsis for this one. I'm not into paranormal stories. I find it very difficult to suspend my disbelief in that way. But, I picked it up in spite of the ghost theme and am so glad I did. I was able to get right into the story because of the main (present-day) character of Lara. She's one of those great chick lit heroines who is the easy-going, sweet, well-meaning younger sibling of a strong, controlling, annoying older sister. She captured me in the first few pages, and so I was invested in finding out how she dealt with the ghost of her great-aunt. And what a ghost Sadie is! She's a bit annoying at first (as she's meant to be), but truly wonderful in the end. As she's \\"helping\\" Lara to update her wardrobe and look, I was literally crying with laughter...could not see the page because I was laughing so hard. That's pretty rare for me when I read. But, I was also touched enough for tears in parts as well. Both Sadie and Lara (and yummy Ed) are wonderful characters. Kinsella knows how to write characters and storylines that are different each time, but wholly involving. Don't avoid this because of a ghost. I think you'll be as captured as I was by this novel, as involved in the characters' lives, and ultimately as sad to see the story end. It's truly a winner.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I wondered as I watched this if anybody is capable of putting more into a role than Ellen Burstyn (Sara Goldfarb) did in this film. It seems to me that she pushed the envelope here. She did just about everything except evaporate into thin air as she portrayed the effects of speed addiction and electroshock therapy. The other actors performed very credibly, but Burstyn is what made this film special.    As many other reviewers at this site have pointed out, this film powerfully displays the hazards of substance abuse. Drugs destroy one's ability to take care of one's self. The world is tough enough when you are strong and healthy; the sea is full of sharks who will consume you if you are not. This film could have been subtitled \\"Feeding Frenzy.\\"    The script, direction, and acting (Burstyn) were all great.  The musical score (Clint Mansell) helped drive it all

And the tambourine that was on my old vinyl pressing on the track \\"Into The Mystic\\" has been restored! The tambourine somehow disappeared from later pressings and the original CD, so that track always sounded sparse to me. I'll get the other two based on how pleased I am with this!
0618680004|5.0|\\"The GOD Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins is a superb, if lengthy, look at religion from a rational point of view. By \\"rational\\" I mean to say unemotional. One of the things I really like about Dawkins is his ability to express his very well thought out point of view in a cogent and focused fashion.<br />He takes traditional viewpoints that are often considered as \\"givens\\" and explores their biblical roots. Often showing that the contemporary interpretations / assumptions are nearly diametrically the opposite of the expressed meanings in \\"the good book\\" or at least completely missing the point that was originally being made.<br />He further explores our seemingly basic need for something like religion and highlights the divisiveness of the institutions that capitalize upon that need. I'm personally pretty sure that people cannot exist without something like religion. Many people are not nearly so rational as I think Dawkins would hope. But disabusing folks of some of the more destructive aspects of formalized religion is one aspect of the book that I completely agree with and is an agenda that I hope is moved forward by its readers.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|It would be easy to dismiss \\"OUTLANDER\\" as another direct-to-dvd popcorn snooze, but surprisingly, director Howard McCain effectively mixes in elements of a Norse-based adventure, science fiction and even an effective monster feature. It also has the cool elements that the male audience would be interested in; swordplay, macho posturing while using the backdrop of a period where superstition and myth reigns supreme. Oh, did I already mention that the film features a blood-thirsty monster from another planet?<br /><br />Norway, 709 A.D. A spaceship crashes down to Earth, its lone survivor, an alien male called Kainan (Jim Caviezel, The Passion of the Christ) is left with very limited means in his quest to destroy a creature that has stowed away on board. Kainan follows a familiar pattern of destruction which leads him to be captured by a clan of Vikings who would like to get to the bottom of such destruction. Winning over the clan's king, Rothgar (John Hurt) and his daughter Freya (Sophie Myles), Kainan becomes poised to lead the charge against the Moorwen, an alien monster from another planet who had developed a taste for human flesh. Joining the charge is the head of a rival clan, Gunnar (Ron Perlman, Hellboy 2) as Kainan and Wulfric (Jack Huston) set out to vanquish the Moorwen, only to find that the primitive weapons of this time is no use against the ferociously, ravenous alien beast. Kainan had found something worth fighting for, but can courage and ingenuity truly win the day?<br /><br />\\"Outlander\\" may not be exactly groundbreaking but it makes use of its good points to generate an entertaining experience. The film is a straight-to-your-gut monster movie, with mild staples of sci-fi elements nicely mixed in with its Norse backdrop. The film isn't trying to be overly ambitious but it does know its target audience--it manipulates the male testosterone all the while appealing with its B-Grade charisma. Director Howard McCain knows how to appeal to those with a fetish for monster mayhem; it is full of bloody action and swordplay. The direction takes an almost \\"comic book-like\\" tone, with a cinematography that displays incredible scenery for this amazing events.<br /><br />Amid all the monster mayhem, the film does have some strong bits of characterization. Kainan is a man torn by guilt with his alien race being hinted as nomads who takes over any habitable planet, even if it belonged to someone else. The links between him and the creature may have vengeance as the common denominator; Kainan wishes to avenge his family's death and the creature for his own kind. Kainan finds that he has similarities to this tribe of Vikings, and much like \\"Dances with Wolves\\" learns to love and respect them. His developing friendship with Rothgar, a rivalry with Wulfric and a boy named Eric are brought into exposition, as he even begins to harbor feelings for Freya, despite his love for his dead wife. Despite the fact that Kainan is an alien, he acts very human with out sensibilities.<br /><br />The Viking clan are also developed as we are privy to their customs and their entertainment. We see them eat, dance, and play; they do act like Vikings. They are unkempt, dirty, and very rough around the edges. McCain does give us an idea of the Viking lifestyle, these guys do love wild boar and mead. It was also an exercise in careful scripting that the Vikings have become aware of Christianity, although it was a little underdeveloped that the idea felt a little forced.<br /><br />This film has adventure written all over it, as the direction takes the action to caves, forests, underground and even underwater at times. The screenplay does succeed to generate some thrills as the Vikings do more than fight, as they try to cope with this other worldly menace with swords, axes, arrows and wobbly shields. The script is clever enough to guide out protagonists through this problem, with a sense of trial and error. Yes, \\"Outlander\\" does have numerous \\"Man Versus Monster\\" match ups--if at first you don't succeed, try again. The creature designs are inventive enough to keep me interested, it is however, a little disappointing that the creature is mostly designed from CGI. The CGI rendering feels a little uneven, as some shots look better than others. The film does have a mix of old-fashioned blood and gore on some kill scenes which pleased me, and the den of the beast was freaky, as we see its feeding ground.<br /><br />\\"Outlander\\" is a film with a nicely drawn-out plot and the script stays grounded enough to keep the flaws of the CGI effects from notice, as the creature is proven to have more personality than your usual eating machine. It is a refreshing approach to develop a monster that appears as a blood-thirsty beast at first look. The film does have some plot missteps as the third act requires a large suspension of disbelief. I find it hard to believe that any metal that can withstand re-entry in the atmosphere can be re-forged through the usual means. However, the film's script also manages to keep its energy as the film kept on moving.<br /><br />I guess \\"Outlander\\" is worth a look. It is a great exercise in genre entertainment that has full-blooded adventure, action, sci-fi and a nice monster feature to get the job done in viewing entertainment. It is just responsive to genre needs; swords fashioned from a space craft, Viking fights, machismo, a glowing monster and even features a tattooed, hammer wielding Ron Perlman.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I love my Britax stroller, but was lost without a drink/ wallet holder on top. This thing fits easily, works perfectly. It has a drink holder on each side and a small zipper/ mesh compartment for a few dollars in the middle open area.<br /><br />The canvas seems to wash up well. Very durable and practical. Our handle for our stroller flips down to bring the stroller up to you when sitting. This flips over the handle to hang on the handle in both positions.<br /><br />I would recommend also purchasing a similar thing for baby when he/she is older if you have the Britax stroller (or similar).<br /><br />I like the tasteful, simple black, but would have preferred some color/ pattern options. Or, maybe even a more intricate picture on one side for the baby to stare at...just a thought :).
0525421033|5.0|This book is a wonderful read. Do not read this in public because this one will bring tears to your eyes-I'm warning you! That doesn't mean it doesn't have humor though, because there were many times I found myself laughing out loud. This is an intense story that will not only appeal to teens, but have a lot of crossover adult appeal as well.<br /><br />Gayle Forman does an excellent job going from Mia's present to Mia's past and drawing the reader in so they truly understand her love for the cello, her family, and Adam, her boyfriend. As I was reading, I felt like I really got to know Mia and her family and found myself grieving along with Mia-the writing is just that powerful.<br /><br />If I Stay is a short read, but it packs so much in and I wanted to savor every moment. At times I found myself reading slower and drinking in the words because I didn't want the story to end. The story centers around music, Mia with her cello, Adam with his band, and Mia's dad being a drummer, and Gayle Forman's writing felt lyrical. She was able to capture music and put it into a book. I don't know how to describe it but it was like I was reading a song-hopefully that makes sense!<br /><br />The themes of love, loss, grief and hope are so powerful and beautifully written that this story will stay with you long after you finish the last page.<br /><br />Gayle Forman has made a soundtrack for the book, which you can find on her website.
B00000IZOR|5.0|My son got this toy for christmas. I introduced him to it when he was 6 months old... it was instant love!  He eats the reciever, smacks the phone, and makes it ring.  The toy is wonderful, but I think the age range is off... it's better for babies (6 mo - 1 yr) than toddlers.  Like others mentioned, I would either tie the pull string very short (in a complicated knot a baby can't untie) or better yet, cut it.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I rarely write reviews; I just tend to read them and most are quite helpful. I'm writing this for two reasons: to comment on some of the negative \\"reviews\\" here and to share my thoughts and feelings about Gran Torino, which may be Clint Eastwood's last movie.    Last night it was late and I still wasn't tired at all, so I went to my DVD collection and Gran Torino practically jumped into my hands. I put it in and before I started to watch it (for the 6th time in the last 3 weeks), something told me to read the reviews at Amazon. After perusing through all 252 comments I was amazed at the people who gave negative reviews. The most used comment was \\"wooden acting\\".     My brother, who studied cinema and is a screenwriter, and I (and I studied film as well) talked about that very same comment that so-called professional critics leveled at the movie. We laughed at that because of two reasons: we grew up near a lot of Asian people and if they don't know you they are VERY withdrawn and may seem a bit... well, wooden. So Clint was being true to life with the portrayal of the Hmong people.     The other thing that made us laugh is that Clint Eastwood is meticulous and thorough when he does pre-prep for any movie, especially one he plans to direct and act in. His work ethic allows him to be spontaneous behind and in front of the camera. And the \\"critics\\" didn't even notice that he purposely shot this film with a grainy stock, almost to make it have the look of a student film or a documentary. He intended to give the look and feel of Gran Torino the same sense of immediacy and uncertainty Walt Kowalski feels. Why else start with a funeral, followed by the experience we the audience have of seeing him alone in a house filled with so-called family ?    We're intended to feel his unease and sense of aloneness as well. And at the same time, next door, a child is being blessed: death and aloneness at his house while new birth and renewal of life is just next door... although he doesn't know it at the time while we do.    One last note about the negative commentors: I noticed that they tended to be very short, like one sentence or two, whereas the people who liked/loved the movie wrote some really detailed comments on what the movie meant to them. Not one negative comment gave a detailed account of why they didn't like the movie. It seems they just got on the \\"wooden acting\\" bandwagon. Perhaps they may be relying on he \\"crituque\\" of so-called critics they'd either read or seen on TV.    I've been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford movies lately. I've just been really drawn to them. I feel that they had similar careers, in that that they were perceived at first as nothing more than pretty boys- eye candy for the box office. But they both were very serious about their craft and became very masterful along the way. Both learned the basics and became excellent actors, directors and story-tellers. And both have created some of the best American cinema since the 1970s.    What I love about both (for some reason they seem very much the same in that they let expression and subtleties express SO much more than words ever could) is that they are major stars and icons in our culture but they were mostly focused on their craft. So we have the benefit of a very rich legacy of cinema to learn from. And their movies are so fun to watch the lessons are effortlessly learned. Now that's magic, to me.    As a musician, writer and hopefully one day, a screenwriter as well, I cannot even think of a better place to start than with movies from Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford. \\"Less Is More\\" is a sometimes over-used and misunderstood adage. With them, they make that saying sing like Maria Callas at her peak. They've taught me that economy can equal depth, as well as a VERY important thing: get the audience engaged and thinking. They've showed me, in movie after brilliant movie- just how much you can get from that simple yet difficult to master concept.    Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's summation of his career, his limning the interstices of his place as an icon in cinema and yet another treatise on the art of \\"Less Is More\\". I first saw it in the theatre, the first time in years I'd even had the desire to go see a movie. I was a bit shocked at the graininess of the film stock at first but then I understood what he was doing. Just like in Unforgiven he used shadow to express light, here he was using graininess to express the very refined craft of making a film. And, as I wrote earlier- that grain gives a sense of immediacy, almost as if he couldn't wait to say, \\"Action !\\" and roll film.    He sends up Dirty Harry (\\"Get OFF my lawn\\") and the Outlaw Josey Wales (the first time he has that what turns out to be a spitting contest of sorts with the Hmong grandmother, who's spit is more potent than his, was hilarious). Those two characters redefined modern cinema. With Dirty Harry, an entire genre of movies wouldn't have been as rich as they became; The Outlaw Josey Wales brought the Western back to prominence in modern cinema.     While embodying these mythic characters on film he always knew his role in becoming an icon and understood the larger implications. So, while sending them up he also adds a great degree of pathos to Harry Callahan and Josey Wales. He's studying them along with us and adding more depth and richness to them. What a brilliant technique !     With Gran Torino we are watching a master seemingly effortlessly and quite playfully display his work for us to see just what it takes to make great art. And he gives a very eloquent summation of his iconic impact on modern cinema. And besides that- it's a great film. Popcorn, please !    This movie clearly shows he wasn't just a pretty boy. There was a great artist always inside.

B001N26GFM|3.0|I cannot understand why the producers of this film cast English actors with very English accents to play the roles of Germans.    Surely, there are enough German-born English actors, or English actors who could employ a German accent to add some sort of authenticity to this film.  Actor's Equity may have prohibited them from using Germans, but, in my opinion, the accents made it hard to believe.  Not that the story is unbelievable or unworthy in any way, but marred by the absence of German accents.
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|Truly excellent book, especially for someone like me who hadn't appreciated the importance of networking in business and in life. Yes, as some have pointed out, Ferrazzi drops lots of names, but each story illustrates an important point. For some, \\"Never Eat Alone\\" could be a life-changing read. It also got me thinking how some successful businessmen who've practiced and honed such \\"hyper-networking\\" skills their entire career should stay out of politics: Networking is in part about doing favors for others, both for its own sake and in anticipation of others repaying your favors in the future.

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.<br /><br />The first two were \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby\\".<br /><br />What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?<br /><br />Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.<br /><br />The script for \\"Gran Torino\\", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.<br /><br />The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.<br /><br />But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.<br /><br />Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.<br /><br />To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.<br /><br />I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.<br /><br />I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...  The film certainly deserves deluxe treatment.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Demi Lovato has a great voice. Here We Go Again for me is better than Don't Forget. Here We Go Again is more mature than Don't Forget. Demi has a great sound reminds me of Kelly Clarkson. She makes great music for her age. I like this album, I can listen to Here We Go Again more than I can Don't Forget. Don't Forget was a great debut album for her. I think her fans will like Here We Go Again more than Don't Forget. Some of the songs on Here We Go Again I can sing along to. If you like Demi Lovato's Don't Forget you're going to love Here We Go Again.<br />My favorite songs on Here We Go Again are:<br />1. Stop The World<br />2. World of Chances<br />3. Remember December<br />4. Everything You're Not<br />5. Here We Go Again<br />6. Gift of A Friend.

B0029NY9YO|5.0|Much has been made of the supposed difficulty of transposing Alan Moore's graphic novels into the medium of film. Previous attempts such as V for Vendetta and From Hell received mixed receptions from critics and audiences, but were both actually very good pieces of cinema. Moore's public disowning of the film imaginings of his work has harmed them, but it says more about his non-conformism than it does about the quality of the movies themselves.     Watchmen is a beautifully crafted and fascinating story (it is one of the New York Times top 100 novels of all time after all). Atmospherically shot, with gravelly narration by the disturbing and uncompromising Rorschach, the imersion into the alternative 1980s history is immediate.     Cold War paranoia has been racheted up and nuclear armageddon seems imminent and terrifying. In 2009 this has less intrinsic power than when Moore penned Watchmen in 1986. The Soviet giant has crumbled and nuclear proliferation has reduced, but the capability of humanity to destroy itself is still a hard truth of the world we live in. That's what makes the character of Dr Manhattan so engrossing. A man turned into a being of god-like power, his struggle to save humanity causes him to lose his own. The portrayl of Manhattan by Billy Crudupp is wonderful; quiet, regretful and absorbing. This is juxtaposed with visual representations of a towering blue giant, destroying human lives with a gesture. The parallel with the awful responsibility of controlling a nuclear button is clear.     The other characters are as well drawn as they need to be to lend support to the blue gargantuan, Rorschach being the most compelling, but Manhattan is the centrepiece. Given near infinite powers, the question settles in the viewers mind, how would I respond to the the needs of my loved ones? My country? The world?     Moore's story is ascerbic and engaging, the lines between good and evil are blurred. The thoughtful, compassionate Nite Owl partners with the uncompromising and brutal Rorschach. Ozymandias mixes intelligence with maeglomania and explains the true nature of sacrifice. Silk Spectre and the Comedian explore themes of human emotions and responses; the interwining of love and grief, exhaltation and regret. As a whole Watchmen is a rich, well textured story which provokes thought as well as entertaining. Watch it.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|It's been said before, but I'll say it again--\\"Creed is dead, and Alter Bridge is here to stay.\\"    Albeit \\"Open Your Eyes\\" sounded as though it was left off the Weathered CD, but flashes of genius soared in tracks like \\"Metalingus\\" and \\"Find The Real.\\"  I knew this band was destined for greatness and have been anxiously awaiting their follow-up CD to One Day Remains.  This review is a bit late in coming, but I ordered the CD while I was deployed and just never got around to reviewing what has not only become my favorite band of all time, but my favorite rock album--Enter Blackbird!!!     Miles takes us on an emotional journey in the song \\"Blackbird\\" (an intense song about death and loss) and keeps the heart pining for more in \\"Watch Over You\\" (another epic ballad about love and loss).  If you're not into the ole' heart string pullers, then crank up the volume for \\"White Knuckles\\" and \\"Come to Life\\"; both are sure to deliver.  If your longing for some Creed then their first single \\"Rise Today\\" is sure to bring back fond memories for Creed fans.  Don't worry, though, if you're in the \\"I despise Creed\\" corner this is the only song on the album that will create such nostalgia.  The rest is ALL Alter Bridge.    For me this album was a 10!  Kennedy, Tremonti, Phillips and Marshall are the perfect ingredients for a solid rock band, so don't let the \\"Creed\\" associating detract--these guys ROCK!  I'm already itching for their next release!!
B000WN8AHA|5.0|This is part of the great 1/35 series from Tamiya. It contains over 200 pieces, 3/4 of which are dedicated to the Sonderkraftfahrzeug itself. There are many tiny pieces, but good dimensional precision makes the assembly process reasonably smooth. Tamiya's tough plastic also keeps breakage to a minimum.    Tamiya supplies a mounting kit with [[ASIN:B00061HJ6Q 1/35 German 3.7cm Pak35/36 AT Gun]], which allows a combination of the two kits into Sdkfz 251/10. I did not choose to build that because the soldiers are not designed to operate the Pak on the vehicle.    This kit is the same as [[ASIN:B00061HJ52 1/35 German Hanomag SdKfz]].

Foreigner Suite still blows my mind when I hear it.   Get real people, was he suppose to be creating music dating back to the American folk music of the working  class that started in the 50's when we were entering Synth music of the Eighties.  This IS his most explosive and relevant work to date. AGELESS
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|Where does one begin??  This movie can easily put someone in a coma.  If you have insomnia, this just might do the trick in getting you to sleep!  Horrible film!  I was really hoping this one would knock everybody out of the park but this movie just drags on and on and on...<br /><br />The best parts of the movie are really when the film is taking place during Hurricane Katrina and even at that, you're lefting wondering at the end of the movie why they even put it in there.<br /><br />Aside from the hum drum and depressing subject matter, the special effects deserve at least one star.  They truly are unbelievable.  Except special effects can't carry a movie!  One only need to check out a myriad of other films that have tried to do the same thing-Battlefield Earth anyone??<br /><br />Steer clear of this turkey!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This was a great movie.  The commercials didn't do it justice.  It may offend some in the beginning, but you really need to watch it all the way through.  I laughed, I cried, I got irritated w/Clint's character, but still an excellent movie.  Just make sure your children are in bed.  It's not a movie I'd let my kids watch.

Forget the criticisms of the rah, rah Bush...just read the story and you will find yourself re-living through Marcus's eyes a harrowing tale of heroism, honor, duty, and brotherly love.  From the SEAL training to operation Redwing to the compassionate treatment and protection from the Afghan community to final rescue and return home... I found myself not always agreeing with Marcus's perspective, but understanding why he feels so strongly, as he recounts what he went through to become a SEAL.  And, what he and his buddies did for each other and for country.  Wow, what a story - all Americans, especially Texans, really should read this account.  Thanks, Marcus, for sharing with us all.

As for the remastering - apparently when UMD took over from Virgin they rushed these titles out on the market and they didn't do much to the remastering already done by Virgin.  So all this discussion about remastering is in the imagination of the listener.  I have both editions of the disc and have an audiophile sound system and cannot hear a noticeable difference in either version.  So get which ever version is cheapest and enjoy.

0743246616|5.0|I got this book as a Christmas present from a cousin who lives in NYC.  I, from North Carolina, had never heard of the Magnolia Bakery or of the owners, so I did a mental shrug, thanked her heartily, and brought it home.    The book starts with a \\"tips on baking\\" section, which is a great read (I'll never bake with cold eggs again!).  The recipes are varied - there are breakfast baked goods, cakes/cupcakes, and all sorts of icings and glazes.  And the pictures are just delightful!      But you don't use a cookbook for its pictures...  I tried the Apple Cake with Cinnamon Sugar Topping - and it came out perfectly - moist and rich and delicious - a real hit with the family.  Then I proceeded to try other recipes - and each came out wonderfully!  I'm still working through the recipes, but I haven't had a mediocre one yet!    If you're just starting out baking or you're a seasoned pro, I highly recommend this book to add to your collection.  I feel like my own collection is a lot better for this addition.     Thank you so much, dear cousin!!!

B001FB55I0|4.0|As a fan of the entire Terminator movie series, you would be forgiven for assuming that I would hate this movie. The truth is that I didn't watch this movie hoping it would match the brilliance of the original movies as I knew that simply wasn't going to happen. What we got was not a film that captured the terrifying doomsday essence of what made Cameron's two Terminator films so brilliant. We also didn't even get the cool and slick looking destruction heavy style of the third Terminator film. What we got instead was, what I felt, to be a perfectly captured post-apocalyptic world which contains a marvellous depiction of the human race when faced with what seems as the impossible fight for survival. Director McG has received a lot of doubt about his ability move the Terminator saga into the post-apocalyptic world which we first gained a glimpse of in the first Terminator movie. That doubt had no foundation and what McG presented in the finished piece, although the plot could do with some polishing, was a fantastically frightening environment with some cool effects and worthy acting throughout.<br /><br />The plot sets John Connor in the year 2018. The machine uprising has begun and only small pockets of human resistance movements exist with the soul purposes of surviving and destroying the machine threat. John Connor has finally entered the position he was fated to enter since before he was born and is now the leader of the human resistance. He has encountered the machines before which gives him and his teams the advantage when knowing what they will be put up against as the human/machine war continues. As the resistance fight continues Connors father, Kyle Reese encounters Marcus Wright who we see at the start of the movie receiving lethal injections on death row just before the war begins. Marcus doesn't know what's happened as he woke up in the post-apocalyptic world with no memory of the machine initial attempt at destroying the human race. Marcus quickly partners up with Kyle Reese and a child we know as Star who are also on a mission to find the resistance leader and join the fight. The mystery eventually unfolds and we find out whether Marcus was sent from the future or is merely a survivor of the past and he becomes pivotal in the fight against the machine threat.<br /><br />The film itself was very touch and go throughout. Some parts worked where others didn't but the entire piece presented an enjoyable action movie that doesn't go too much into the fight for survival on the psychological end of things but does retain the aura of desperation that the humans feel in their fight. Christian Bale was surprisingly awful in this and I honestly expected more from a man taking the reigns of the legendary John Connor. Bale presented an ultimately one dimensional character and you had to question his motives of taking the role of this infamous movie character. The mysterious Marcus Wright character, played by the brilliant Sam Worthington is a movie saving character from start to finish. His whole performance is brilliant throughout and manages to drive the plot along successfully with very little to work with in terms of original character depth. Kyle Reese played by the brilliant up and comer Anton Yelchin is also a delightful addition to the movie and adds again a bit of depth to the movies plot. Other supporting cast include Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife Cate. Also, a cool little cameo piece goes to the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan who is a Doctor for Cyberdyne Systems and actually turns out to have a more pivotal role.<br /><br />The action is brilliant throughout and with the apparent unbeatable nature of the machines this manages to present quite a daunting aspect to the theatre of the battles that ensue. The scale of the machine warfare is quite disappointing as when we first glimpsed the human/machine war in the first movie, we gained a glimpse of what seemed to be a constantly chaotic battle which left us wanting more. This film doesn't use Cameron's image as McG takes away the futuristic lasers and hoards of machines lined up executing human after human and he exchanges it for the odd flying scouting machine, a large harvester robot which merely collects the humans for what seems to be mass slaughter and of course, the T-600 machines which are a less advanced model of the T-800 machine which we all know as the 101 machine or Arnold Schwarzenegger who we all miss from this movie. This is probably what the movie is lacking the most as the absence of Arnie is certainly a drag for the Terminator franchise and I'm sure that if the effort were put into the writing, they could have found a role for the older Arnold in this film.<br /><br />There's not denying that Terminator Salvation lacks the charm and excitement of its trilogy of predecessors, however, there's a lot that this film brings to the Terminator universe. The possibility of John Connors son, the look at the early models of the Terminator machines and the new machine concepts make it quite enjoyable. Had the acting been a bit better and the supporting cast a higher level of significance, this film could have been on par with the original 3. It's still a good film and a worthwhile waste of just under two hours.chaotic battle which left us wanting more.

0307588335|3.0|The collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered one of the worst financial disasters in American history.  This book is an interesting perspective written by somebody inside Lehman Brothers.  One of the important subjects explored in this book is the relationship between U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehman Brothers.  It clearly was not cordial, and Lehman had been a major rival of Mr. Paulson's former firm, Goldman Sachs.  A very hostile 2008 dinner between Fuld and Paulson is discussed on pages 305 to 308 in the book.  One wonders who leaked this information.  It was clearly not Mr. Fuld since the author accuses Fuld of pretending the meeting was a big success and misleading people about what happened.<br /><br />The author takes a very harsh and probably well justified view of Lehman's CEO, Mr. Fuld, but a larger question for the American taxpayers and public to consider is the question of judgment on the part of Mr. Paulson.  Shortly after refusing to help Lehman and setting in motion a huge panic, Paulson authorized an aid package for AIG which now totals a stunning $180 billion of taxpayer money.  Part of that money went to cover huge debts (many billions of dollars) owed by AIG to Goldman Sachs and other creditors.  Was this wrong?  Time will tell but it is total nonsense for Paulson and Bernanke to claim that they were \\"unable\\" to help Lehman.  By contrast Merrill Lynch, run by Mr. Paulson's good friend, John Thain, got its takeover by Bank America assisted with billions of federal cash.<br /><br />The strange thing about the Lehman collapse is that is was widely rumored for more than a year before it happened.  It seems that neither top Lehman management nor our government was very alert on this issue.  But then the possibility of a hurricane in New Orleans was considered one of the top three potential natural disasters in America by FEMA's own official list of threats a year before Katrina created the worst natural disaster in U.S. history.<br /><br />The coverage of the final days of Lehman is interesting but not altogether satisfactory.  A key problem is that the author was not part of Mr. Fuld's key circle of decision makers, a fact that readers should be aware of in spite of the publisher advertising the author as an \\"insider\\".<br /><br />To really bring this subject alive I would definitely recommend the PBS video [[ASIN:B001UW59KS FRONTLINE: Inside the Meltdown]].  If you'd like to read more about the great crisis of 2008 I created an Amazon Listmania list on this subject called Books on the Global Economic Crisis of 2008.The coverage of the final days of Lehman is interesting but not altogether satisfactory.

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|This is more of a empty-headed travelogue than a movie. Woody Allen's film was reportedly funded by the Spanish government to create a film that would encourage tourism to Spain (Woody must have been desperate to get financing, considering his last turkeys).<br /><br />In this mission, he succeeded (Barcelona looks delicious, and the Spanish music is used to good effect), but otherwise it's a trifle. None of the characters ring true - we have the hot blonde, ready for anything, the hesitant, neurotic brunette, the bohemian, sexually liberated artist (of course!) and the psycho wife. And worse, there's the incredibly irritating narration that reminds that yes, this is indeed a Woody Allen movie. It's as if Woody had to leave some kind of fingerprint on this mindless trifle, and it makes the film worse.<br /><br />As mindless entertainment, it works - superficially. You have beautiful people, beautiful scenery, and Spanish music that is deeper and more soulful than the film itself. But why should we care about this movie, why bother making it? Oh yes - to sell Spain as a tourist destination.

She can definitely pull off any genre and shows it with this second album. She still has her rock side and it's great but it's also nice to see something different from the usual Disney (or Miley Cyrus). I believe she will go far in her career because she is just naturally talented!    My favorite song off this album are the following (not that I don't like them all) :    U Got Nothin' On Me  Quiet  World of Chances
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|As stated, this movie develops the few characters in it in a creative and interesting way. This movie isn't for any audience. It is filled with offensive and hate-filled comments, so if that bothers you, maybe you should look into something more dolled up by Hollywood.    Although longer than I expected, the movie moves at a decent pace. Parts seem too long at times, but they are all necessary for development of the characters and the plot.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I'll say it right up front: I think this is a great record. A great record that got a bum rap. It's not that the critics didn't (at least more or less) grasp what this is about, but few cared enough to focus on how fabulous the music on this CD is and instead pointed out how it was commercial suicide, how his reach was far beyond his grasp, and how inconsistent it is.<br /><br />Yet what's most striking about this album is how unconditionally, unashamedly musical it is. It sounds like music made by someone who wants to share the sheer joy of his songs with the world. The reviewer at musicOHM gets it somewhat right when he says, \\"Sunny Side Up is bonkers in a good old-fashioned English sense and Nutini's devil may care attitude should be applauded by all right-minded lovers of artistic sidesteps.\\"<br /><br />So I'll do some applauding.<br /><br />The comparisons are many: Otis Redding. John Martyn. Maybe a spot of Johnny Cash. Cat Stevens. Van Morrison. For me, the reference that comes to mind most often is Bryan Ferry. It's not just Nutini's warble, his overtly melodic, full-throated soul croon that reminds me of Ferry. It's his songs: songs that don't particularly care whether they're of their own time. I'm reminded of how, on The Bride Stripped Bare, Ferry made all manner of genres his own and somehow managed to produce a coherent classic that didn't relate at all to the prevalent records of the time. All slick suits and glam, most of Roxy Music's 1970s output is, of course, directly opposed to the trends of the day. Throughout all that opposition, though, it shines by virtue of its sheer musicality, its musical daring. Its warm embrace of both classic 60s soul and European cabaret comfortably meets somewhere in a very likable middle.<br /><br />\\"Everybody's got opinions, girl. Their own version of a good idea.\\" Things start off with an old-fashioned ska tune sung in an Otis Redding rasp. 'Ten Out Of Ten' is a classic dating story: Paolo takes his girl out on the town to cheer her up because she's feeling down. It's a dance tune, this. Not one anyone under 35 would consider dancing to (I think), but a dance tune nonetheless. And a perfect, perfect little gem of blue-eyed ska. Beautifully played and recorded, too.<br /><br />'Coming Up Easy' continues the classic soul theme. Not particularly deep lyrically, but Nutini is skilled at mimicry and hits the tone of classic r&b quite accurately. The finale, \\"It was in love I was created and in love is how I hope I die,\\" repeated over and over, reminds me of Van Morrison's ecstatic blues shouter workouts on-stage circa It's Too Late To Stop Now.<br /><br />'Growing Up Beside You' is a pretty melody and offers a soft, folkish, slow-roller with mostly forgettable lyrics; something about a crush on a girl in school.<br /><br />No matter, because we swiftly move on to the album's pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance: 'Candy.' What an extraordinary song! They're rare, songs like this. This is note-perfect middle of the road radio rock with a laid-back, country feel. Perhaps a good description would be Bryan Ferry singing over a typical early Dire Straits arrangement. It's quite unclear what Candy is about: a love story, perhaps, a plea to stay together after all. No matter that it's unclear because all good poetry merely approximates precision and instead offers words that confuse, intrigue and delight at the same time. And 'Candy' offers the best opening lines I've heard in a song in years: \\"I was perched outside in the pouring rain, trying to make myself a sail. Then I'll float to you, my darlin', with the evening on my tail. Although not the most honest means of travel, it gets me there nonetheless. I'm a heartless man at worst, babe, and a helpless one at best.\\"<br /><br />'Tricks of the Trade' is lovely in that folky way: \\"You took me from my bubble, knowing my defense was weak. And you sat there and you listened, anytime I chose to speak.\\" A core truth wrapped into a few insightful words. Lovely and smart. On to what's perhaps the strangest track here: 'Pencil Full Of Lead.' It's a classic swing/rockabilly number with breakneck lyrics sung in a thick Scottish drawl. It's wacky and it's not everyone's kettle of fish. But it's good in a way that'll make you look back on this record fondly in 20 years as a lost classic, and you'll wonder why people didn't love it the first time around.<br /><br />'No Other Way' is more classic Bryan Ferry/Van Morrison (somewhere in the middle, actually) heartfelt blue-eyed soul, beautifully played but quite a lot over-emoted. Did I mention Nutini has a 'warbly' voice? Well, when he pushes it too much, it has a few kinks that aren't entirely pleasant. He doesn't quite have the young Van Morrison's uncannily perfect pitch.<br /><br />'High Hopes,' 'Chamber Music' and 'Worried Man' combine folk and various 1960s/1970s sounds (like Johnny Cash's story songs) and offer perfect Nutini versions of these kinds of song. They're always more than just exercises in writing music that's just like something else that we already know; what's clear from each tune is how deeply Nutini actually feels this music, how fervently he wants to render his own take on each archetype. The results range from pastoral hippie tunes to Waterboys' style pseudo-Celtic material. (Nutini, while from Scotland, can certainly not be accused of making traditional music.) Finally, 'Keep Rolling' is a sad maritime swansong, a lover's goodbye that spends almost half of its two and a half minutes in an unidentifiable, electronic, ambient warble and sees the album out quietly.<br /><br />My prediction is that Sunny Side Up will grow to become one of those records that we look back on for its immense musicality and daring. And for its commitment to Paolo Nutini's own vision, expectations be damned. Graeme Thomson, in the Observer, said that, \\"One day, when his undeniable talent has settled and set, the results could be wondrous.\\" I beg to differ: they already are. But we, as listeners, need to remember what we loved about our eclectic favourites from the past to fully appreciate it.l Full Of Lead.'

Finally, 'Keep Rolling' is a sad maritime swansong, a lover's goodbye that spends almost half of its two and a half minutes in an unidentifiable, electronic, ambient warble and sees the album out quietly.    My prediction is that Sunny Side Up will grow to become one of those records that we look back on for its immense musicality and daring. And for its commitment to Paolo Nutini's own vision, expectations be damned. Graeme Thomson, in the Observer, said that, \\"One day, when his undeniable talent has settled and set, the results could be wondrous.\\" I beg to differ: they already are. But we, as listeners, need to remember what we loved about our eclectic favourites from the past to fully appreciate it.
B0028K3192|4.0|I love every song on this CD, but only 9 songs.   What does this say about new CD's next year an entire cd will be 3 songs.   I just do not get it,, the prices are not going down.  Why only nine songs! Granted they are all great songs.   He can sang, and produce, write.  Not too many other sigers can do it all, but dang!   Can we get like a bonus cut or something like that....  Thanks Max but because it's so short i can only give it 4 stars...
0061231401|5.0|This book was amazing.  I love the Sigma series and have become totally fixated on the story and the history.  I dont have many favorite authors, but Rollins is one of my new favorites.  His description as well as the knowledge he presents in his books is so exciting.  I love the fact that his books come from nonfiction and then the story is intertwined.  It just makes it more interesting and engaging.  Thanks for yet again another fabulous book.
0143038583|5.0|This is an amazingly informative--yet entertaining--book.  It will forever change the way you look at food, and hopefully will also change what types of food you buy.  I read this book and then went to see Food, Inc.  Our food industry is shameful and rather dangerously unsustainable.  All politicians should be required to read this book.
B0007YXREA|1.0|In brief, this movie was jejune and tedious to watch. It was also cowardly in its cartoonish portrayal of Islamic terrorists, as it takes no \\"balls\\" (in the parlance of this ilk of film) to treat a genuine ideological threat as a sock puppet of another, more tractable and less serious threat (I will not give away their plot, but one can read other reviews to get the relevant details). In doing this, the film follows a long line of others that very deliberately fail to confront head-on the roots of Islamic terrorism. To excuse the film on this score because it is meant to be a satire would be wrong, as the best satires, subtly and indirectly of course, nail the truth (and in particular do not try to tidy it up in an equivocating fashion). But \\"Team America\\" dutifully misses all targets of interest and import; in this opinion I stand at variance with many of the other reviewers, which is unfortunate. Parker and Stone reveal themselves to be as craven as the left-wing actors they insipidly parody. This film fails at every level as a satire, and at best reaches the level of vulgar parody. And by vulgar here I do not simply mean coarse (though it was, but I have no problem with that per se), but rather popular.    Finally, some technical comments: 1) The super-marionation was initially interesting, but its novelty wore off after a few minutes. Moreover, it seemed to have less power here (where it was used in part as a homage but more as a post-ironic sight gag) than in its original, earnest applications (e.g., \\"Thunderbirds\\"). 2) I was extremely frustrated with the poor quality of the puppet mimicry of the Hollywood actors; and so we were deprived of even the simple pleasure of adept caricature (which was my motivation for having purchased this film), with the Kim Jong Il puppet being a notable exception. The other \\"famous faces\\" puppets looked like caricatures of people, just not of those that they were supposed to be caricaturing. 3) I cannot stand Trey Parker's voice-work, and here you are glutted with it.     My recommendation: If you are a poorly read 17-28 old who considers himself a hip political realist because he enjoys watching \\"South Park\\", then you might similarly enjoy this attempt at \\"balanced\\" post-9/11 satire. If not, you'll likely recognize it within minutes (or less) as stunted, pseudo-satirical dreck.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|This movie is entertaining. The cinematography is excellent. In fact, there are some scenes (particularly, in the main character's flashback) where the setting is very innovative and outright amazing looking. And I must say that the whole concept of this movie is cool. A space traveler (the Outlander) crash lands in Norway in 700AD, brings a monster with it, encounters Vikings, has to deal with both Vikings and monster. However, I was disappointed with one or two things. First, James Caviezel's acting could have been better. In my opinion, I found him to be rather flat and unemotional. The character (hero) he plays in this movie deserved better. I think Caviezel was trying to show the toughness of the character, but he did this to such an extent that you don't end up feeling enough sympathy for the character. Secondly, despite the fact that the writers go through the trouble of showing how the Outlander learns to speak Viking, the how of it is a kinda stupid (and for some reason painful) process. Nevertheless, the movie is still pretty good. Even the monster turned out to be an innovative creation that I didn't expect. Yes. I recommend this movie. It's even one to loan out to friends to watch.
B000H2MTUA|5.0|Angela's ashes was the book that got me into reading. Sad, funny, hopeful - all at the same time. The day I bought the book, I ended up spending the whole night in my college dorm and finished it in one sitting - something I never thought I'd do prior. Reading Angela's Ashes, like all his other books is an experience - like having an intimate chat with a long lost friend. It's human, it's real, it's raw - and it's the standard with which I continue to judge other books by.    Thanks for the stories Frank - you will be terribly missed and always remembered.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|My WORKING ON A DREAM review has been a long time coming. I bought the album back at the end of January, but it is one of those albums that you \\"should've listened to\\" but you just didn't. For me, the hype that \\"The Boss\\" was getting for WORKING ON A DREAM was a bit much. Sure, I love Springsteen, but the 5-star endorsement by Rolling Stone, similar to the one given to U2's NO LINE ON THE HORIZON, is the slightest bit over-zealous, if I might be so bold to say so.  No one can deny that Bruce Springsteen is an integral part of rock and roll music; this man is a legend. However, WORKING ON A DREAM is another solid album in his discography, not the masterpiece of say BORN IN THE U.S.A. in which the Boss was \\"Dancing In The Dark\\". I'll give him props that WORKING ON A DREAM is a fine album, though I wouldn't call it a clear-cut masterpiece, as some have over-praised. Still again, it deserves many accolades.<br /><br />The album opens up brilliantly with The Boss's 8 minute saga, \\"Outlaw Pete\\", which would've been well at home of Springsteen's \\"Devils and Dust\\", one of Springsteen's best albums of late. Despite its gargantuan length, \\"Outlaw Pete\\" doesn't sound lengthy, but rather sounds authentic, hearkening back to the Bruce's glory days.  \\"My Lucky Day\\" lays well, speeding up the tempo from \\"Outlaw Pete\\".  The production work sounds like traditional Springsteen, intact with piano, traces of organ, and that traditional rock and roll feel, mixed with a folk edge.  \\"My Lucky Day\\" is no game-changer, but it is certainly a well-valued listen from WORKING ON A DREAM.<br /><br />The most moving track, \\"Working On A Dream\\" just might be a master class on songwriting.  The words are poignant, and you can't help but feel that Springsteen is paralleling the lyrics of this song with the historic presidency of Obama and the notion of bettering \\"the American Dream\\" or at least trying to reclaim such ideals.  This is easily my favorite song and it dispels the myth that title tracks usually suck. The use of a choir just further enhances the message and scope of \\"Working on a Dream.\\"<br /><br />\\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" is solid, if not as outstanding as \\"Outlaw Pete\\", \\"My Lucky Day\\", or \\"Working On A Dream\\".  If it is a downgrade, it isn't much of one as The Boss sells it well.  As always, Bruce's pen proves to be his strongest point. There he never falters the least bit.  \\"What Love Can Do\\" finds the Boss contrasting the lengthy duration of \\"Outlaw Pete\\", clocking in at under 3:00.  Despite the abrupt start (the slightest bit awkward and startling), \\"What Love Can Do\\" easily charms the listener. Not the best of the album, but strong anyways.  The production is very folk-based with a twinge of country rumination. It kind of makes you wish it lasted longer.<br /><br />\\"This Life\\" opens up with incredibly soul-based production.  It makes you wonder if The Boss is going to barrel into R&B. Of course, he doesn't, but \\"This Life\\" proves to be another satisfactory listen.  It grows a bit tiring, but never so much to call this song merely \\"average\\". \\"Good Eye\\" changes the sound of the album slightly, with an incredibly, roots-driven number. \\"Good Eye\\" with The Boss achieving incredible grit, it as enjoyable and \\"worth the listen\\" as everything else. The second coming? No, but overall great and certainly different than so much of the superficial rock and roll that pervades radio and CD shelves.<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" lasts just slightly over 2 minutes. It is beautiful, though not life-changing. It doesn't stand out, but it does contribute to WORKING ON A DREAM.  \\"Life Itself\\" is fine, though not nearly as noteworthy as the best here. Solid and worthwhile, though not revolutionary. \\"Kingdom of Days\\" finds The Boss in good voice once again. Solid, classic-sounding, and well written, the only problem (if it really is one) is much like \\"Life Itself\\", it most likely won't be remembered as a \\"classic\\".  Even though it sounds like \\"classic\\" Springsteen, there is a difference between sounding \\"classic\\" and filling the role of \\"classic\\".<br /><br />\\"Surprise, Surprise\\" redirects any lost momentum, proving to be a fun, enjoyable song.  Here, Springsteen sounds amongst his best the entire album.  The songwriting is spot-on, the chordal progression superb, and everything is \\"in-the-pocket\\" as they say.  Similarly, \\"The Last Carnival\\" and the Golden Globe winning \\"The Wrestler\\" end the album nearly or as strongly as it began.  \\"The Last Carnival\\" could've have appeared on DEVILS & DUST and would've been easily at home.  \\"The Wrestler\\" should've been nominated for the Academy Award as well as the Golden Globe.<br /><br />Essentially, the Boss has produced another great album. I can't overstate that this is by no way his master work.  I also can't overstate that this album is superb, with only few, miniscule flaws holding it back from being even greater. I highly recommend this album to anyone who \\"slept on it\\" like I did for so long.

B001JEB1V8|4.0|Written before he entered politics, this book narrates Barack Obama's quest for his own identity, torn when he was young between his mother's working class white family and the notion of a Kenyan father he hardly knew.    Though it includes many elements of Mr. Obama's personal history, this is not an autobiography. Many issues not related to the main thesis are hardly developed. This is most probably out of tact towards many still alive at the time of writing, such as Mr. Obama`s mother and grandmother, and prudence, given the young man must certainly have been ambitious and realized that most of his career was ahead of him.    The book's title is a bit of a misnomer as it turns out the reader does not learn that much about the father but much more about the son.  This, of course, is what makes it highly interesting and inspiring.    The audio version of the book, taped while he was senator, is narrated by Barack Obama himself. It is quite a thrill to have the President of the United States speak to you «personally» in your own car!
B000002KIE|5.0|OK...Punk rock is ANTI Rock'n'roll, and all of what it stood for... Stardom, chics, and money...Which punk rock bands generally have none of. In NO way did any \\"REAL\\" Punk rock band ever want to get as huge as the Sex Pistols.(But that's what ended up happening in the 80's...Because of the Pistols & The Ramones + others...)<br /> First off. The Pistols were created by Malcolm McClaren(sp)as an attempt to profit from the \\"New\\" Genre of angry young & poor teens who called themselves \\"Punkers\\"...He achieved this only because he had such a Motley group of miscreants, who only knew 3 chord structure (Rock n roll) if anything at all.<br /> Secondly, Sid Vicious. Nuff said.<br />  So...If you wish to say that this album is offensive and awful, you are doing a FAVOR to punk rock in general...If you think it's awesome, you're obviously a punker. So more power to you...<br /> Anybody who writes a great review for Fleetwood Mac, and disses this album is astonishingly enough, NOT into Punk rock. Punk rock was made to rile your insides, boil your brain and spit you out into the street right before a bus hits you.So I hope this helps with your decision to definetly BUY this album... Your friend, Gutter Punk sc*m bag...
B0029358GM|3.0|I'm not fully enamored with this album yet. There are some great tracks and some weak ones.

I still love this band just based on their back catalog alone.
0143038419|1.0|This book is drivel, a waste of time, and garbage.  Elizabeth Gilbert is odious, hedonistic, and as far from spiritually enlightened as I can imagine. She starts as a needy, dependent woman who is obsessed with men, and she ends at the exact same point. What a great transformation.     This book made me cynical.
0385342020|3.0|I am a fan of Sophie Kinsella's out of series books - for some reason the \\"Confessions\\" series never did much for me (although I do read each book that comes out), but I found myself loving Kinsella's out of series books - and this is why I was sooooo thrilled when I got a copy of Twenties Girl.<br /><br />Twenties Girl is different from anything Kinsella has done before - yes, it is still chick lit and yes, the great writing is still there, but this time, Kinsella decided to incorporate a ghost as a main character.<br /><br />As the book opens, we find one of our main characters Lara - dealing with her mother's questions, as they head to a funeral for Lara's great aunt, Sadie, at the age of 105 - a great aunt, that apparently nobody knew or liked very much if we go according to the number of people attending her funeral. Because I did not want to give anything away to myself, I had refrained from reading the jacket flaps and therefore initially thought that somehow Sadie would end up leaving poor Lara some money or something like that. But no, Kinsella had other ideas and decided to make Sadie's younger self, rise up from the coffin and speak to Lara. This becomes the premise of the book - Lara and Sadie make an unlikely duo and as they both quest for closure and direction (not to mention a necklace) they find themselves deeply drawn to each other.<br /><br />There are some truly funny moments in this book and Kinsella's writing is, as always, top notch. Kinsella knows how to write a chick lit novel - but I have one question! A GHOST?????????????? Yeah, I know that chick lit is, for most of the time, stretching it a bit, but Kinsella kind of totally lost me when she introduced the ghost. I mean, this story would have been extremely interesting without this, what I consider to me cheap ploy. What is it with authors these days???? everything is about the paranormal - and it just does not work for me.<br /><br />I loved the passages in the book when we discover about the twenties and about all the beautiful clothes, etc - I love reading about London and finding out all kind of great little tidbits, but everytime \\"Sadie\\" came into play, I felt completely cheated and frankly, a little bored.<br /><br />I am sorry, but I just don't buy this whole paranormal thing in novels - best left to the non fiction writers in my opinion.he beautiful clothes, etc - I love reading about London and finding out all kind of great little tidbits, but everytime \\"Sadie\\" came into play, I felt completely cheated and frankly, a little bored.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I don't much care for the 'this is the best album since...' reviews or that this album is a 'return to form' whatever that may mean (I can probably figure that out all on my own).<br />Let me simply say that if you've liked Metallica, past or present you will like Death Magnetic.<br />Personally I've heard several of the Death Magnetic songs on sirius over the last months and I decided it was time to purchase a CD. I haven't purchased a CD in years. I download everything. When Death Magnetic arrived I put it in my system, turned it up and did nothing but listen. After a couple of songs I found myself laying on the floor, eyes closed, letting the music wash over me.<br />I let the album run through a couple times, absorbing it.<br />I have no complaints.<br />If you like Metallica.<br />If you like metal.<br />You will like Death Magnetic.
B000002UDV|1.0|problem with this album is every song is the same musically.there is no heavy drums on any song.no electric guitar on any song and if there is you sure dont hear it.every song on here sounds the same musically a little variety is what makes an album great.every song shouldnt sound the same musically and thats the main problem with this album.it would be nice if there was at least one song on here with heavry drums and a real rocker  but no.the whole album is a very laid back mellow effort.the only song i liked on here was oh caroline and that was it.other great albums have variety look at the beatles album revolver they have taxman on there and eleanor rigby and got to get you into my life and tomorrow never knows all those songs are totally different thats what makes it so good,pet sounds is none of that its all the same musically no rockers no drums no guitar just a very soft mellow sound which is rather a bore.
0375842209|5.0|It seems that many readers miss one of the lessons of this book. So think about this. The story concerns Germans in Munich during World War II. We meet ordinary, lower class, blue collar German families living life the best they can. I think they are beginning to realize bad times are coming, but they do not realize just how bad. The children of these families could be children anywhere. They laugh, play soccer, scrape their knees, go to school, fight, and laugh some more. One of them steals books. One dreams of being as great an athlete as Jesse Owens. As they grow, their lives are shaped by the politics and war surrounding them. We know the story of World War II so there is no need to go into it here. Did we know or realize that the citizens of the country that became our enemy were in reality so much like us? Did they know that we were so much like them? Did we see each other as ENEMY? Or as just another kid to play with?     Zusak gives his reader a fine story, with rounded, true characters. He brings a large, dramatic period of time down to an accessible small place, where we can go and feel we know the characters, or folks just like them. We see bravery, heroism, unselfishness, and love in circumstances we simply cannot imagine. And if we are truly fortunate, we will not forget what we read here in and between the lines.     I took a few years before reading this book. There was too much hoopla about it. I have a bit of sensitivity about the Nazis and that period. I didn't want to read this. Now, I have, and I am grateful to Zusak for giving us Liesel, Rudy, and all the others. And for shaking up my thinking. If you have not, read it now. Be you adult, an older teen, someone who lived through that period and remember, read this book. If you are very young, put this book on your shelf and wait a little -- but read it when you are ready.
B000ZELISO|3.0|I am crushed because I LOVED this book, and looked forward to the movie since I read it when it came out!  I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...  The director destroyed the heart and soul of this book by taking the MAIN story line out, and lightening it up! I am surprised J.K. Rowling did not step in and say NO you ruined my book!  I am severly upset about this!  They need to be forced to fix this!
B001BJ690Y|4.0|As far as the Blu-Ray version is concerned, it's pretty much the same as the standard DVD release a few years ago. Same extras. The quality is much better; vibrant and rich colors ( a little grainy in places). You will notice more on screen than the standard DVD version. Disappointing that they left part of the sword fight with the Crazy 88 in black and white. The Japanese DVD has it in color. I thought they could have done that with the Blu version..but no. I love this film, so the Blu version is great for me. I would like to see a future DVD of this film packed with more extras and left cencor-free. Until then, this is the best on offer.

B000005H63|5.0|I believe this was one of the first Michel Petrucciani's CDs I bought. I have 9 others...I wonder how many he made? I count 33, but I could be off. Some of his early CD's have half of his own compositions with a balance of standards from Miles Davis, Henry Mancini, Thelonious Monk, Cole Porter, Sonny Rollins, Rogers & Hart etc...some CD's are solo piano, other duets, most are trios. He started out as a classical pianist but always loved jazz. His main influences were Bill Evans & Keith Jarrett but he has his own smooth sound yet fast style.<br /><br />This CD contains all of his creations with 2 different trios:<br /><br />September 24, 1987 songs 1 to 5 with Michel Petrucciani on piano, Gary Peacock on bass, & Roy Haynes on drums. Song #2 with John Abercrombie on guitar.<br /><br />December 9 & 10 1987 songs 6 to 9 with Michel Petrucciani on piano, Eddie Gomez on bass, & Al Foster on drums. Song #7 with John Abercrombie on guitar & song #9 with Steve Thornton on percussion.<br /><br />If you know your Jazz you can see that these are 2 great trios. Each artist with his own history, style, & merit.<br /><br />The CD starts out with fast jazz piano work but slows down into some quite beautiful ballads. A great place to start your own Michel Petrucciani collection.

1439157383|4.0|Piccoult's book deals with Anna Fitzgerald, created solely to provide for her dying sister, Kate, who is stricken with a rare form of leukemia. Anna, at 13, finally decides she wishes to sue her family for rights to her own body, causing a situation in which the family is nearly torn apart.     The story unfolds through the narratives of all characters involved, save for Judge DeSalvo and most importantly, Kate. While Piccoult does an excellent job at crafting the different views to the unfolding situation, I found it at times muddled in confusion - I may be reading Campbell's narrative and think it's Julia's or perhaps Anna's perspective. This is due to a lack of a clearly defined voice on behalf of all characters. None of the characters have any type of dialect or speech that distinguishes them from each other. For example, try as she might, Piccoult could not make the sassy, witty lawyer Campbell's speech uniquely different from the more low-key, whiny Julia. Anna's thoughts and speech, as well as the seemingly less educated Jesse's, are not realistic of minors (Jesse just reaching 18). A delinquient, no matter what the reasons are, would likely have much more of a foul mouth. Jesse's hormonal attempts to woo Julia are awkward, and suited for a pubescent pre-teen instead of a fully grown adult.  Anna herself did not strike me as a 13 year old; even though she's mature for her age, I can't honestly believe she's that incredibly proper in speech and diction.   The story itself is compelling and right from the start, the drama begins with Anna filing a lawsuit for medical emancipation. There's lots of family drama with the occasional Sara reminiscing of the time when Kate first became ill all the way to the present day. Jesse has his own story to tell, which involves juvenille delinquincies that are simply a cry for attention. Even the shabby Campbell lawyer and guardian ad Julia have their own subplot. Each subplot contributed well to the overall main plot and werevery entertaining.    Except one subplot - the Campbell and Julia subplot. Not only was it so badly cliched but it was downright cheesy, overbearing, ridiculous and completely out of place from the main plot. From the moment the two met (after 15 years of separation), to the times each character recalled the nostalgic past relationship, I could not help but roll my eyes repeatedly. Eventually, when I saw another flashback approaching, I simply skimmed through.  I felt like I was reading a juvenille fiction book, not the serious novel with the issue of minors as organ donors. While Campbell eventually won my sympathy in the end, I could not find redeeming qualities in the snide, bitter Julia. I mean come on! 15 years? You would think a grown woman would get over it and stop the bitter tirades. All she did throughout the entire novel was whine, make nasty remarks to Campbell and...whine some more to her sister. Sure, Campbell probably deserved it, but this was 15 years ago. It's pathetic that this woman could not move past the normal stage of broken hearts that ALL teenagers suffer. Furthermore, when did she actually sit down and get her work done? Sure, there were the occasional chats with the Fitzgerald family, but what else? Rarely did I get to see the side of Julia attempting to piece the family together; instead, her woe-is-me bitter relationship with Campbell took center stage. At the end of the trial, even *I* didn't know what Julia would recommend.    Finally, the ending of the book left quite a bit to be desired. The last 40 or so pages depicts a total twist on the situation, which could have worked, but it was so  hastily scripted that I simply couldn't feel emotion.  It was very unexpected, but somehow, it just didn't work at all.  Overall, it was an excellent read, but I strongly recommend you skip the Julia and Campbell back in high school parts. It will NOT detract from the rest of the story.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing the 30 Day Shred DVD consistently about a month and I am very happy with it. I've done my fair share of exercise DVDs/videos and this is one of the first that I stand behind. When I first started the dvd I realized how out of shape I was (I literally thought I was going to collapse), but I stuck with the modified versions and as I built my heart up I was doing the more \\"advanced\\" version of the exercises. Like others have said, the workout consists of circuit training: 3 min. strength, 2 min. cardio, 1 min. abs, which I like. The exercises are effective and you feel great when you're done. I feel I get a better workout in 20 minutes compared to when I would go to the gym and spend 30 minutes doing cardio and throwing in some free weights and waiting for a free weight machine. Do take note that Jillian's not there to waste your time - when she says 20 minutes of intensity, she means it. If you're debating on purchasing this dvd like I was, do it. You'll get your money's worth.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I have a classical music background and, though I like and enjoy popular music very much, I had never gone wild over a pop music concert. Never, until now. I bought this DVD prompted by a death that caught me by surprise and saddened me very deeply. I had so much hoped Michael would make a comeback and show off his great talent to the whole world once again. When I realized this would never happen, I thought buying his DVDs was the best thing that was left for me to do. I started watching as soon as it arrived and I sat there, in front of the television, unable to move, trying not to miss the slightest detail, unwilling even to stretch out my arm to grab a glass of orange juice sitting on the table next to me. From beginning to end this concert is a stunner. Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent, charisma, charm, professionalism, elegance are right there for us to rejoice. I had seen Michael on other videos and he had always charmed me but this particular concert is so good that I cannot imagine anything better. Together with Michael's unique art, the brilliant musicians, singers and dancers that toured with him marveled me. \\"Smooth criminal\\" is one example of what a group of outstanding professional singers and dancers can contribute to a show like this one. I am so glad I purchased this DVD. Thank you so much, Michael Jackson, for all you have given us. You are unique, the best there has ever been, the best there will ever be. I will always keep you in my heart.

0385342020|4.0|Lara's life is teetering on the brink of disaster. She is grappling with unpaid bills, a business partner who is missing in action in Goa, and a relationship that ended too abruptly for Lara to process. (She isn't really stalking her ex -- she was just texting him three or four times a day to understand exactly what went wrong...) The icing on the cake? She has to spend a wonderfully sunny day at the funeral of her 105-year old great aunt, Sadie, a woman she never met. \\"Life really sucks,\\" she muses, as she treks off to the crematorium with her parents.<br /><br />But life is about to get suddenly more exciting and a heck of a lot more bizarre for Lara. As the vicar struggles through a perfunctory eulogy at the funeral (attended only by Lara, her parents, snide sister Tonya -- think Dr. Zhivago, here -- and her ultra-successful smarmy Uncle Bill and his family), she suddenly hears a voice. \\"Where's my necklace?\\" it demands of Lara. No one else can here it -- and suddenly a young woman in flapper garb materializes. \\"I'm having a  hallucination,\\" Lara realizes. \\"A full-on, walking, talking hallucination. And it's coming toward me.\\" She tells herself not to talk to the hallucination. (\\"It'll only encourage it.\\") When the hallucination -- the ghost of the departed Aunt Sadie -- realizes she's about to be sent into the crematorium furnaces, she shrieks at Lara to stop the funeral. And Lara, driven nearly insane by the ghost's shrieking, complies -- and begins a quest to find Sadie's necklace and let her go in peace.<br /><br />Kinsella employs many of the usual conventions of the ghost story (think Blithe Spirit). She makes the most of the comedic potential of a young woman who is having a genuine encounter with the spirit of her late great-aunt in her prime as a 'twenties girl' (the reference is both to her age and her aunt's age as a ghost, as well as to the flapper era of Sadie's youth), a young woman whose friends and family already felt she was on the verge of losing her grip on reality. Kinsella, for the most part, deftly walks the line between humor and over-the-top farce, and there are some genuinely poignant moments as well, moments which in some of her previous novels (particularly the Shopaholic series) never quite rang true.<br /><br />But it's Sadie who steals the show -- and the reader's attention from the often hapless Lara. She devises ways to use her ghostly powers to help her  out of her professional and romantic fixes, even as she's being a very demanding presence indeed. While no one in their right minds would ever pick up a novel by Sophie Kinsella looking for peerless prose or philosophical insight, this is definitely a cut above the Shopaholic novels, retaining the light and humorous touch that makes those readable, while steering the plot away from what becomes tedious brand-name/consumerist obsession on the part of Becky, the heroine of that series. Sadie, with her zest for the (after)life, is a joy, and under her tutelage, both Lara and the story blossom. In another fun twist on the chick lit genre, in this book, the plot revolves as much around the relationship between the two 'twenties girls' as it does the more conventional 'boy and girl' plot.<br /><br />The ideal summer beach read, undemanding and laugh-out-loud fun. Highly recommended for fans of the author's work (it's easily my favorite of her books to date, followed by [[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]]) and for afficionados of the lighter form of chick lit. If you like her books, don't forget to check out titles published under her literary alter-ego of Madeleine Wickham.

B001DHXT6G|2.0|I bought season 3 in the remastered edition.  I think this remastering was a terrible idea.  It's vandalism, just like colorizing old movies.  Taking a classic and editing out original footage and replacing it with something else changes it's character.  Maybe they thought it would be cool to make the original series look like the later series but I don't want the original series to look like the later series.  One of the things that's so great about the original is what they were able to achieve with such a small budget and low technology.  I'm now ordering season 3 through Amazon.com marketplace in the older edition to match my seasons 1 and 2 and I'm going to get rid of the remastered one.

Most gluten/wheat-free dessert recipes often turn out flat and/or doughy. The recipes contained in \\"babycakes\\" are scrumptious enough not only for her but our whole family enjoys them. I highly recommend this cookbook, not only for those troubled with celiac disease and/or gluten and wheat allergies, but for anyone who wants to expand their dessert repertoire.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Believe the hype. This show is as good as they say. Bryan Cranston, who was the rock that held down Malcolm in the Middle, shows his range as an actor here, playing a wizard scientist who is dying--literally and spiritually--from a quiet, middle class life. He is a passive aggressive father to a disabled son and a loving but sometimes overbearing wife. His life has been a series of surrenders to bearable compromises with himself, and he is content teaching chemistry classes to disinterested high schoolers in Albuquerque. But once he finds out he has cancer, he comes up with the crazy scheme of cooking crystal meth to make money for his chemotherapy and to provide for his family. He doesn't have to break the law, but we see that he does it because it fills a primal urge. Being a criminal gives him the thrills and release he has long needed.<br /><br />Breaking Bad is not a simple cops and crooks show. Instead, it combines elements of heavy drama, action, Tarantino-like black comedy, and Hitchcockian thrills. As with the great Showtime series Dexter, it's very good at switching gears. And like Dexter, Breaking Bad is incredibly intense. It doesn't go for cheap shocks, and Cranston wisely plays his character as a tired, likeable everyman. What separates him from normal guys, however, is his genius with chemistry, which gives him powers that combine elements of superheroes and supervillians.<br /><br />Season 1 is only seven episodes long, but they are all excellent. This is top-notch television.
1573300403|4.0|I owned \\"Michael Jackson - History on Film vol. 2\\" for years.  I've always wanted to get the second installment, but never did for one reason or another.  When Michael died, I knew it was time.<br /><br />I watched it for the first time tonight, and I'm very bitter about two things.  \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Beat It\\"'s videos were repeated on vol. 2 when they already appeared on vol. 1.  I wouldn't have minded a live version or either video, or maybe a \\"making of\\".  I was disappointed for their repeats, when there were several videos that could have taken their place, like \\"Dirty Diana\\", \\"Keep it In the Closet\\", \\"Leave Me Alone\\", etc. that would have been splendid.<br /><br />Having said that, there are three points of highlight that makes this DVD worthwhile: the 1995 MTV Music Awards performance (OMG) and \\"Scream\\", which in its day was the most expensive video ever made, and the only one Michael did with Janet.  Last but not least, the first public performance of the moonwalk, on Motown's \\"25: Yesterday, Today and Forever\\", which rumored that MJ wasn't intending on performing in originally.  Aren't we glad that he did?<br /><br />Make sure you know what you're getting before purchasing.  For my money, I would have bought vol.1 only.<br /><br />Side One:<br />1.  Program Start<br />2.  Teaser<br />3.  Billie Jean (Motown 25; Yesterday, Today and Forever)<br />4.  Beat it (the repeated video)<br />5.  Liberian Girl<br />6.  Smooth Criminal (not in its entirety... I could have sworn there was a whole nother part of this video that's missing)<br />7.  1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance<br />8.

B000002V1D|4.0|Sometimes musicians make an album that is different than their other ones--one where everything 'clicks.' Usually, such an album takes their music in a new direction. This is that album for Duran Duran. It is a very different sound than their trademark '80s fare, and that's a good thing. It is much less dated and is accessible to a larger variety of fans. The sound is larger, and the songs are more compelling than their other work.
B0012GMUI6|3.0|Roger Waters began writing the material for The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking when he began writing what we all now know as The Wall. Waters brought his bandmates two demos, one of which would become The Wall and the other that would become The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, in search of creating a new Pink Floyd album. His bandmates chose the demo that became The Wall thereby making history. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking continues many of the themes evident in The Wall (isolation, failed relationships, family issues, and anxiety)but much of the music moves in a new direction. In a few places, Clapton imitates Gilmour's style but this is later abandoned. David Sanborn is extraordinarly here and helps intensify Water's vocals and emotional wailings. Overall, this concept album is a dream sequence revealed to the listener by way of a vocalized monologue accompanied by music and interspersed with sung dialogue by the other charcaters/singers who are a part of the story/dream. This is a must own if you are a Roger Waters fan.
1592400876|4.0|A bestseller on punctuation. Who would have thought? I am one of those people who loves to find spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes so this was right up my alley. Truss explains rules clearly and gives great examples. She is British but explains the differences of some of the American rules of punctuation. She also addresses the way that English rules change with time like not using periods after abbreviations which is occurring more and more. The problem is when punctuation is misused and meaning is unclear.  The book is very readable and funny. I plan on using some of the examples with my high school students.
B000002A3T|2.0|Although much better than its predecessor, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell, like the previous release, is not a Pink Floyd Album really but a David Gilmour solo recording. Although Wright and Mason contribute on the tracks, the whole feel of the album is all Gilmour. His softsoken vocals combined with the ethereal blues guitar style we've come to cherish and admire, lacks any real resonance and feeling. What's missing, of course, is Roger Waters' dynamic vocals (and incredible bass lines of course)that lends itself so well to Gilmour's guitar magnificence. The album is pure parody of Pink Floyd in it's prime. While Gilmour himself has said that this is the best album by Pink Floyd since Wish You Were Here, it is nothing of the sort. His comment is clearly a crack at The Pink Floyd albums Animals, The Wall, and The Final Cut which were primarily Waters' driven projects. Give the album a careful listen to the lyrics and you will find that this new project is Gilmour's own \\"Wall\\" whereby many of the same themes of the original are revisited. Gilmour is definitely trying to outdo Waters but fails miserably.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay's most textured, satisfying release to date.  There are a few deficiencies (like having 3 songs with a tagged unfinished song to close it out).  But, those are forgivable.  This may be hard for them to top.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|Listening to this recording you can clearly hear that it is the beginning of the end for Pink Floyd as we know. First, Wright's keyboard virtuosity is missing (he had left the band by this time)and Gilmour's presence is like a ghost scared to show itself. Despite these absences, Waters is truly amazing in his intensity of feeling making The Final Cut worthwhile to own and have in your CD collection. As far as concept albums go, it is one of the best--it continues the anti-war ravings and isolation themes evident in The Wall. Also, it anticipates the primary theme in Water's solo album Amused to Death. The gems of this release are: The Post War Dream, When The Tigers Broke Free, The Final Cut, Not Now John, and the incredible closing song Two Suns In The Sunset. While The Final Cut is not nearly as remarkable as The Wall, it is a great link from that masterpiece to Waters' solo career beginning with The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.

Generally if you openly call people stupid and evil, they aren't going to openly accept your overall thesis.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this mobile when my son was 8 weeks old and it was the first thing that made him stay in his crib without crying.  He would lie and just stare at it mesmerized by the slow movements and bright colors.  Coming in every 15 minutes to push a button sure beat standing there, winding up a mobile every couple minutes.      He's able to play on his own now that he's 16 weeks, but he still loves watching it.  It has never put him to sleep though, it gets him very excited and he \\"dances\\" and laughs whenever I turn it on for him.  I use it without the lights and music and he still goes crazy for it.  I would say this is the best purchase I made for my newborn, as he loves it, it looks great in the nursery, and it saved me from having to hold him all the time!    Easy to put together and install, long-battery life, and overall excellent material quality.
0739383248|5.0|Sophie Kinsella is credited by many as the author that got them into chick lit. Readers stumble upon the Shopaholic series, and it explodes from there - I've heard the story many times, and it is applicable to myself, too. I wonder if anyone who had not heard of the Shopaholic book series before watching the movie have now decided to follow up with Shopaholic and Baby?<br /><br />Due to lack of Kinsella novels to read (I have read them all), I recently reread Remember Me? and had plans to reread the Shopaholic series... until I found out she was publishing another book.<br /><br />In steps Twenties Girl - a novel about two young women, one of them being a ghost. The basic plot made me a little wary - for some reason I'm not big into ghost novels - and I remained wary for the first few chapters, but there was no denying that this book was written by the talented Kinsella, and that fact alone kept me hooked.<br /><br />I will admit, I was starting to get very annoyed with the bossy ghost - because of her ghost attributes, she was able to manipulate many situations, and sometimes I found it utterly annoying. Most of the novels I read have very real scenarios, and while I'm not saying ghosts don't exist (because really, who knows?) I haven't heard many stories about ghosts talking to people this much.<br /><br />After about halfway through the book, pieces started fitting together, seemingly unrelated plot lines started intertwining, and I found myself reading the second half of the book in one sitting (which was no easy feat, this isn't a short novel). Perhaps if I had been paying attention I would have caught on to some of the things that transpired, but I am never good at that anyway, so instead I was shocked at some of the events.<br /><br />This book gets an additional thumbs up because it was held to a higher standard than I usually hold books - because I had read a multitude of Sophie Kinsella books, I already expected to enjoy this one, and could have very easily been let down (I wasn't).<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella fan or not, this was a great summer read. I even (gasp) took a break from my Sookie Stackhouse books to read it, which should say a lot if you've been paying attention to my other reviews. The only downside is that now I don't have any other Kinsella's to read. I guess I may end up rereading the Shopaholic books after all.nsella fan or not, this was a great summer read.

B000002J1U|4.0|For some reason, I've taken more of a liking to Led Zeppelin's roots style of music in this album than on their previous two, which I didn't get as much out of it...especially as found on their debut album. No doubt that can be put down to the band drawing on different roots traditions here. Have gotten the impression that III isn't exactly a favourite amongst fans of the band, due to their sound being less rock orientated than before...it has a lot of accoustic guitar songs on it.    The stand out song on this album is:    Immigrant song - A classic song. A classic (wobbly) riff. Has a good bass guitar groove to it. Plant emits ethereal, banshee squeals in this song. My favourite Led Zeppelin song from the first three albums, in fact...his sexualised moaning in the II's \\"Whole lotta love\\" can grate, but it still has the distinction of being an early song which stacks up well, even today.    The next best songs are:    Gallows pole - features a nice accoustic guitar part, the only pity being that it doesn't go on for longer. There's also an unusual sounding stringed instrument...not sure what that is. Also features a jaunty, harpsichord sounding type instrument. The fuzzy electric guitar which features in this song can also be described as \\"jaunty\\". The banjo features in this song too, and the bass is noticeable.    Tangerine - features very nice accoustic guitar picked notes...sort of mediaeval sounding...which is what I meant earlier by saying that the band draws on different roots traditions in this album. There is some country sounding electric guitar in this song too, as well as some fuzzy lead guitar. And it makes me wonder...maybe \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" has its origins in this song?    The best of the rest:    Friends - an interesting track...sort of bluesy. Features accoustic guitar and violins (or is it a synthesiser?).     Celebration day - Sort of avante garde in a bluesy/country lead guitar way. The guitar does sound interesting in this song. My memory is not the best, but this song did bring to mind Beck's song \\"Loser\\"...so, not sure if Beck was influenced by this song.    Out on the tiles - A heavy, rock song.    That's the way - really nice, pleasant accoustic guitar note picking and strumming happening in this song. Some country electric lead guitar too. I especially like the guitar part for about the last minute of the song.    The rest:    Since I've been loving you - comes in at around 7:23 minutes long. Features soulful vocals but the song is very bluesy as is the lead guitar. The song also features the organ. Drums are prominent in this song - odd beat...spaced out vibe with some slow fills and some fast fills.    Bron-y-aur-stomp - nice accoustic guitar (I'm reminded of \\"Duelling banjos\\" in this song...maybe the guitar sounds a bit like a banjo sometimes). Country flavoured song with a booming beat and which sometimes sounds like it is ripping off the riff of The Everly Brothers' song \\"Wake up little Suzie\\".    Hats off to (Roy) Harper - sounded a bit faux stereo to me (like those records of the mid sixties which didn't really have the technology behind them to give you the full stereo effect) because the guitar comes through one speaker and you get distorted vocals on the other speaker. Think this song may feature a slide accoustic guitar. A bluesy song with some lyrical similarities to \\"Hey Joe\\", which was a song made famous, perhaps, by Jimi Hendrix in the mid 1960's.    Anyway, whereas I was quite dismissive of The Rolling Stones' similarly rootsy album \\"Let it bleed\\" (which I gave only 2/5 here), I just found Led Zeppelin's efforts here more engaging. This album does have rock music, but it also has country and blues influences too.    On first listen, I would have given this album 75/100, but on second listen I gave it 80/100. At this point in the band's discography I don't think that they really deserve the status of rock Gods, but they have released a couple of great and modern sounding rock songs in \\"Whole lotta love\\" and \\"Immigrant song\\". For me, there is only one Led Zeppelin album where you could argue that it was made by rock Gods...and that is there next one.    Anyway, if you like rootsy type music, you may want to check out their peer's - Black Sabbath - self-titled debut. It's not my favourite Black Sabbath album (that honour goes to the masterpiece \\"Paranoid\\") but it may appeal to people who like rootsy type rock. With IV, Led Zeppelin created an album to put them in the same league as Black Sabbath.
031606792X|3.0|I know my opinion doesn't count for much, since it's just one among thousands.  But I think this book is about as good as the other books in the series.  God knows it's not great literature by any stretch of the imagination, but it's fairly entertaining.  Sure, there are a lot of rather ridiculous occurances in this book.  And the \\"climax\\" is more of an anti-climax, but I kind of expected it to end with a whimper instead of a bang.  But it never really bored me, so that's something.
B00297FEUI|5.0|Currently, the limited run CD edition of the original TRANSFORMERS score is only available at ridiculous second hand prices, so I quickly snagged this CD to the sequel movie.  I thought the movie was just okay, but the score is epic!  I have been long complaining that the days of humming a movie's soundtrack (think RAIDERS, STAR WARS or even HALLOWEEN) have been ignored long enough.    These past few years have been more about synth drones and soundscapes, rather than melody and harmony.  Don't get me wrong, because I love synth sounds and weirdness as heard on such movies as THIRTY DAYS OF NIGHT.  But, dammit, I've been missing that one, two punch of actual \\"music\\" that I used to get out of listening to Williams, Goldsmith and other greats like Horner and Silvestri.    This year there seem to be more big league sci-fi/fantasy movies than ever!  The year is not up, but little did I expect for the TRANSFORMERS 2 score to best the competition of STAR TREK, TERMINATOR: SALVATION and others!  Jablonsky is my new guy.  I looked him up and realized that he also scored THE ISLAND, another decent score in my soundtrack library.     TRANSFORMERS 2 has sound design, scope, plus harmony.  It's a great blend of orchestral and synth sounds.  One of the best in a long time.
0679411585|5.0|General Hal Moore and Joe Galloway combined to write one of the most memorable books on the Vietnam War.  In 1965, early in the war, then-Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore's battalion air assaulted into the Ia Drang Valley and became involved in a fight for their life against North Vietnamese Army units.  In \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young,\\" Moore and Galloway describe not only the battle but Moore's training of his battalion before they went to Vietnam, as well as the follow-on battle at nearby Landing Zone Albany.    Moore's description of the fighting is based on his personal recollections and interviews and correspondence with many of the participants.  Galloway, a UPI reporter, showed up halfway through the battle (and was later awarded the Bronze Star for his part in the battle) and recounted it for Americans back home.  They combine to give a harrowing account of this brutal battle.    Reading this book, one can't help but question the strategies employed in the Vietnam War.  Although Moore's men fought valiantly and skillfully, their mission - an air assault deep into the jungle to find and kill the enemy - doesn't seem one designed to advance any political goals.      Moore and Galloway have written an excellent book on the Vietnam War that should be read by all military officers and by anyone interested in the Vietnam War.  Recounting the lives of all lost in the battle as well as the whereabouts of many of the survivors, this book is about Moore's men and, ultimately, an homage to the men under his command that he lost in Vietnam.

Mounting was really easy, and despite knowing before hand what to expect I was pleasantly surprised to see all the mounting options it comes with.<br />I also really liked the nice touch it adds with the cable routing clip. It's not very solid and cables do escape it every once in a long while, but it's still a nice thing to have.<br /><br />If I were to find something to pick at, it'd be the way the vertical tilt works - one of the axis of movement is at 45 degrees to the rest of them, so adjusting the vertical tilt is a not just a single operation, but you have to work a few seconds to get both the tilt and the rotation perfectly aligned. Not a negative point by any stretch of imagination.<br /><br />Due to the positive experience with this purchase, I am considering a laptop arm-extension too.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Loved it when I first saw it ages ago. Classical music with Disney animation! Better than Fantasia 2000 in my opinion. A must see.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my Fostex MR-8 recorder and did a little research on the XENYX 802.  Just looking at it with it's inputs, number of controls, I would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks. Imagine my surprise when, after reading the positive reviews, that I discovered this thing was only [...]!  I bought it immediately and, right out of the box, it did exactly everything I was expecting it to - this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the Fostex. I'm quite excited about my future recordings using the 802 - I'm like a kid with a new toy!  Highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost.
B001PR0YBM|5.0|Great movie! Lovely color, images, story line. Can't wait for it to hit theaters here! Definetly a worth seeing movie. Everyone will love it!
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|When Return to Oz\\" came to the theaters (in Germany), it didn't reach my town, so I missed it. My first opportunity to watch it was on a small video screen in 4:3 what made the movie look smaller then he really was. To enjoy it 20 years after on the silver screen in my living room should be an impressive rediscovery. It is a shame that this movie had been such a flop because its makers had the courage to let it look so much darker and more realistic than the famous prototype named \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". But I guess that the comparison with the Judy Garland classic was the most important reason for its downfall, completed by the disinterest of the studio for which this new vision missed the typical Disney corniness. The more it is enjoyable for me to see that so many people still love this movie and connect numerous positive childhood memories with it.  I hope that Mr. Murch would occasionally take a look at this site to know how much his sole work as a director is still appreciated. I wished he could have done more in this way.
B00006AFF5|4.0|I think this movie is hillarious. No it isn't the same as the original grinch (originals are always #1 IMO) but it's a great follow up. Jim Carrey brought a new spin on the character of the grinch. It's more contemporary but it's still has a basic outline of the original. In this movie the grinch is cold, angry, heartless but also comical despite his bitterness and it's refreshing. It has more of a hollywood spin on it but it doesn't mean it isn't good.
0061733199|5.0|More than i expected, i havent seen the other books in this category to compare, but this one seems like a good buy imo. I've only read the first 4 chapters & have leared quite a few new things already. i've only camped a little when i was younger so im no expert. From skimming the pages it has decent pics on plants to avoid, eat, etc, definately not as good as a dedicated herb book, but decent enough to give u an idea what to look out for. I noticed it had a chapter on telling directions etc by the stars/moon, didnt read it yet, but random thngs like that made it a great buy for me personally.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Excellent DVD set. Plenty of extras. My only complaint is the cheap packaging for the DVDs.
0756405890|5.0|Many reviews have been written here, so I'll be brief.  If you've connected with the work of George R.R. Martin and Robin Hobb and you're looking for a piece of fantasy literature that will meet your expecations, this is it. I read it a year ago, and I patiently check Rothfuss' blog every few weeks for word on the publication of book two.     At this point, I'm actually anticipating Rothfuss' next book more than Martin's (probably because it's more likely to be published in my lifetime).  ;) I highly recommend this book without reservation.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|This is by far the best album of the year (well for me anyways). I find myself listening to it on repeat for hours and hours at a time. AC has a way of hypnotizing its listeners through their beats and melodies. I can't get enough of it. Their lyrics are also amazing and thoughtful and make you wonderrrr. I love all of the songs on the album way too much to pick a definite favorite but i would have to say that my top three are Taste, Summertime clothes, and Lion in a coma. Now i just wish that they would come within a 75 mile radius of my house so i could go and see them live! I don't know what my ear drums would do without this band.
B001CZVVW8|3.0|I have this opera film in high definition DVD (not Blu-ray), and enjoyed it very much.  However, I could not believe my eyes when I checked out the listing on Amazon.com for the Blu-ray version, and it said Renee Fleming and Mikhail Baryshnikov.  Shame on you, Amazon!  I love Baryshnikov's ballet videos, but please don't confuse him with Hvorostovsky just because he is Russian!  That listing would frighten off many opera fans, who would then miss an interesting interpretation of Onegin, with some marvelous voices.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Albums like this come don't come around very often. Not a bad song on the lot. Amazingly good for an American band. Definately a keeper!
B00284BMBM|5.0|The more I listen to this one the more I like it even more than his first album and I would not have thought that possible.  To those that reviewed this and said he can't sing you need your hearing checked.

0061231401|5.0|James Rollins is back with the 5th entry in the SIGMA series & the 6th book overall in the SIGMA-verse. This novel stands at 448 pages with 33 chapters divided into 4 parts with a prologue and an epilogue. It also features 'Notes from the Historical Record', 'Note from the Scientific Record' & an 'Author's Note to Readers: Truth or Fiction'.<br /><br />These have always been a part of his books and especially so in the Sigma series and they make a very compelling read. For those interested in pursuit of more information regarding the subject of a particular book the notes are a veritable treasure trove.<br /><br />The novel has all the chapters via third person narratives. The characters from the previous SIGMA books are all back in this one as well. We get to see Gray Pierce, Painter Crowe, Kat Bryant, Monk Kokkalis, Lisa Cummings & Joe Kowalski and quite a few extra personages form the previous books in the series.<br /><br />OVERVIEW & ANALYSIS: This book is set after the events of the preceding two books namely \\"The Judas Strain\\" & \\"The Last Oracle\\". The superlative writing of Jim's books makes it easy for the new reader to jump in directly in this book & understand the story. This however is not advisable purely from a Rollins fan perspective as one would be able to understand the characters arcs & the overall back story in a lucid manner if one has read the preceding titles.<br /><br />\\"The Doomsday Key\\" opens with a prologue set in the 11th century England. This has been the case since the 1st SIGMA book \\"Map of Bones\\" wherein James Rollins has always set the prologue always in a different time & era in regards to the book.<br /><br />The prologue is set during the compilation of the \\"Doomsday Book\\" in 11th century Britain. The collectors happen upon a village with strange markings and an entirely decimated population. The strange cause of death is definitely shocking as are the weird symbols etched there. From this scenario we proceed ahead by a millennium roughly and we are shown two morbid scenarios on two different continents, one in Africa & the other in Rome.<br /><br />We are then introduced to Gray Pierce & Monk Kokkalis who are interrupted in their male-bonding soiree by Painter Crowe informing them about the aforementioned events. Not before long, Gray travels to Rome to meet Rachel Verona & understand the events happening over there while Monk travels with the newest member of Sigma, John Creed, to check the stuff sent from Africa.<br /><br />Awaiting Gray in Rome is Seichan, the Guild assassin, who has an agenda of her own and is desperate to nullify the actions occurring in the \\"Judas Strain\\". Taking these two plot threads, Mr. Rollins weaves quite an adventure with lots of action, battles & explosions in a variety of locales and then gives quite some fascinating bits of information about various groups & places in the locations mentioned.<br /><br />The scientific & mystical facts which form the basis of this novel are enumerated below:<br /><br />- The disappearance of bees from colonies worldwide<br /><br />- Saint Malachy's prophecy concerning the 111 popes of Rome of which coincidentally, Pope Benedict is the 111th as predicted in the Saint's vision<br /><br />- The hunger problem faced by the world in which the population is increasing exponentially while the food supply isn't<br /><br />- Genetically modified crops & the scary possibilities faced by mankind due to rash & unethical experimentation<br /><br />Taking these facts & enmeshing them with histories about the Celtic cross & Black Madonna, along with real life organizations & places like The Rome Club & the Doomsday Vault, James Rollins has written another successful SIGMA book & fans of the writer will not be disappointed at all. In fact the ending chapters have some terrific revelations for the series as well as a partial cliffhanger outcome.<br /><br />The only negatives in the book are that they can be a bit predictable when it comes to characters & extreme situations. However I believe James Rollins is writing adventure-laced tech thrillers and these aberrations can be pardoned for the sake & pace of the story. This is another extremely fast paced thrill ride created by a writer who seems to have honed his skills to near perfection and has craftily set the stage for a magnificent encounter between SIGMA & its ubiquitous adversary within the next series book. Also the way in which James ends the last chapter, will most likely start a huge debate amongst fans regarding the identity of the character left unnamed.<br /><br />NOTE: Fans of the author and other similar thriller writers might notice a character being mentioned who is not created by James Rollins but by another terrific writer who shall go unnamed in this review, but for the ever curious person (like me) please hop over to [...] & scroll all the way down to this specific video interview \\"Writers Digest Live: 31 July 2008\\" (15th from the top) and therein lie all the answers you seek!se aberrations can be pardoned for the sake & pace of the story.

B001C48EF6|1.0|Has anyone seen this film in America? I can't find it playing anywhere, and it is now out on dvd and of course we in America can't buy it from amazon.co.uk (they won't ship it to U.S., probably because of the format, it might not play, but even Family Video and Blockbuster do not even have this film in their 'database'. So what's up with this film not being seen in U.S.?) Thanks for answer to this question. rl.rhodes@earthlink.net
B00288KNJU|5.0|This movie was amazing.  Visually, it was mesmerizing.  The soundtrack was perfect.  My favorite animated movie since toy story.   Love, love, love this movie.
B002C2XXJY|4.0|I absolutely love some songs (Catch Me is one of them, even though I'm still a little wary about the changeover to a more upbeat song towards the end). I prefer when Demi shows off the acoustic side of her voice (Falling Over Me, Everytime You Lie reminds me of Behind Enemy Lines in terms of melody). Got Dynamite, a rockier song, is still great. Some songs were just okay for me and I wish that Demi wasn't a Disney star so she could showcase her own music     The inconsistency I'm refering to is really all the different styles Demi is doing. It's nice that she can pull off so much, but I just wish she could have at least made the album flow a little better. The first track, Here We Go Again, is basically Kelly Clarkson-esque. U Got Nothin On Me sounds like 80's arena rock in the beginning. Catch Me is so stripped down compared to the rest of the CD. There's just so much going on, that I don't feel that it's a great ALBUM. I think if they tweaked the order of the tracks, it would be a little more appealing even.    Also, Gift of a Friend has to be one of the corniest, sappiest songs I can recall in recent memory. It's also lyrically out of place with the other songs. It sounds as if Disney forced her to do a song about friends and all that good stuff - If you get songs individually, I would suggest leaving out this one (World of Chances would prob be another)
B0024FAG4Y|5.0|It's about never giving up hope.<br /><br />The 1978 film \\"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS\\" was a film that was known for its controversial story but also seen as a film masterpiece as it was the first major film to depict foreigners inhumane treatment in prison and it was brought alive due to the awesome performance by actor Brad Davis (\\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"Roots\\") and a film directed by Alan Parker (\\"Bugsy Malone\\", \\"Pink Floyd the Wall\\", \\"Fame\\", \\"Evita\\" and \\"Angela's Ashes\\") and a screenplay by Oliver Stone (\\"Platoon\\", \\"JFK\\", \\"Natural Born Killers\\", \\"The Doors\\" and \\"Alexander\\").  The film would also feature the talents of composer Giorgio Moroder (\\"Flashdance\\", \\"Scarface\\" and \\"Over the Top\\") and cinematography by Michael Seresin (\\"Fame\\", \\"Angela's Ashes\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and \\"Step Up\\").<br /><br />\\"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS\\" would be nominated for seven Academy Awards and won an Academy Award for \\"Best Music\\", \\"Original Score\\", \\"Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium\\".<br /><br />But what caught attention was that the film was based on a true story of Billy Hayes who was convicted for smuggling hash and sentenced to four years in a Turk prison where he and many people were tortured.  To make matters worse, he became a scapegoat to prevent foreigners from even thinking of smuggling drugs in the country by having his sentenced overturned and giving him a life sentence.<br /><br />Hayes book \\"Midnight Express\\" details his life behind bars and the inhumane treatment that he and others received in prison and eventually how he escaped from the prison.  The film adaption had gone through so many hands through its screenplay adaption and studio pressure that in order to make it a commercial film and due to budget constraints and location challenges, there is a difference between the book and the actual film.<br /><br />But despite the controversy (which Oliver Stone and even the real Billy Hayes have regretted the film's depiction of the Turks), the film was well-known for its powerful performances and its powerful storyline.  It's a gritty film that shows the violence behind Hayes experiences at the prison and torture they received.  Including other things that were deemed quite controversial back in the late 70's.<br /><br />It is important to note that this film is featured in Digibook format (a book format and not the standard blue blu-ray case) as it contains a 42-page booklet with Director Alan Parker writing a personal memoir titled \\"Anatomy of a Film: The Making of Midnight Express\\" is included.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS\\" received its 30th Anniversary treatment back in 2008 and in 2009, gets its High Definition treatment as the film is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).<br /><br />The film looks incredible on Blu-ray and also compared to its DVD counterpart, the film really shows off the detail and grittiness of the prison and also how bad the conditions were (note: this is one of the controversies as the actual prison was supposedly created in the 1960's but the film makes the prison look like the prison was created many decades before).  But the picture quality captures the grittiness of the prisoners and the overall look, is not exactly vibrant but quite detailed.<br /><br />The film looks as if there was little DNR (digital noise reduction) was used and overall, you can see grain on the film.  Overall, this is a superb transfer to Blu-ray and another classic film given awesome treatment from Sony.<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1. (Also in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and the original English mono soundtrack).  For the most part, the film is front channel heavy as it is dialog-driven.  Although there are action sequences, they are very few and if anything comes alive is the music by Giorgio Moroder.<br /><br />Overall, its great to see the film receive a lossless soundtrack and also include the original mono soundtrack as well.  But you are able to hear the screams of the prisoners while being tortured and overall, the pain and anguish from the talents who just are trying to keep sane in the prison.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS\\" comes with several special features featured in High Definition and Standard Definition in English (Stereo) and Portuguese and Spanish subtitles.

This book is quite thorough in the challenges the film had and also, how Brad Davis was a method actor and in essence became Billy Hayes.  Also, how warden Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) was also a bit rough on the actors during the torture scenes to the dismay of the actors who were to pretend as if they were being beaten (and too get that realism, Smith didn't hold back).  Also, how John Hurt (who played Max) didn't shower for six weeks in order to make his scene seem real and natural.  The personal memoir is quite detailed and those who enjoyed the film will enjoy reading this book filled with photos and storyboard sketches.<br />  * Commentary with Director Alan Parker - If you thought the booklet was full of detail, Director Alan Parker really goes into detail of each scene and what transpired behind-the-scenes of the making of \\"MIDNIGHT EXPRESS\\".<br />  * The Making of Midnight Express (7:27) The original 1978 featurette with an interview with the real Billy Hayes.<br />  * The Producers - (25:54) Peter Guber (Executive Producer), Producer David Puttnam and Director Alan Parker discuss the challenge of making the film and the changes that had to be made for the film.<br />  * The Production - (24:27) Interviews with Director Alan Parker, Producer Alan Marshall and Billy Hayes.

0780626966|4.0|I was very satisfied to watch all of the movies in this collection until I got to New Nightmare. I opened it and put it in without even glancing at the dvd. It was the Enclopedia bonus featurette disc on the screen instead of the movie! I immediately looked in that disc's case to see if I had put in the wrong one and I hadn't. I had two of the same dvds and no New Nightmare! I was so disappointed and ended up buying New Nightmare from Amazon by itself a few months later.
B001I1123O|5.0|\\"Stop it!\\", says one of the  most lucid and important scientists of our time (and maybe of all time). Not only a first-order biologist, but a thinker in the widest sense of the term. Enough of gods, ghosts, virgins, and martyrs. Enough of massacres, inquisitions, censorship, and superstition. Enough of clowns with purple robes, of murderers with turbans, of madmen (and women) with the stern frown and the degenerate sexuality. There is no God. There never was. The powers that be make them up, and they design them in order to rule. The humble invent their own and then they perish or either reach power and get perverted. Dawkins tears apart, methodically and with a sense of humor, the \\"proofs\\" that have been made up to explain the existence of the spirits. Be it Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselmus, or any other sacred cow. And what to say about Mohammed and his Allah, Yahve and all the rest. Bloodthirsty, hypocritical egotists. Vain consolation, gunpowder for hatred, veil to knowledge.     Giving the Muslims for lost, Dawkins is astonished at the religious revival in the US. At the hatred and persecution against atheists, surely the most discriminated minority. Just think: can a confessed Atheist ever win elected office in the US? Apparently not. He is also astonished at this revival in the \\"Age of Information\\", at the persistence of irrationality and fanaticism, at pathological negation and, above all, at the mental laziness that has descended on Earth.     Now, do you want to find wonders, miracles, inexplicable paradoxes? Let's get a peek at science. At quantum physics, where nothing is as it seems. At astronomy, evolutionary biology, genetics. At mathematics. There you will find wonders. There the mistery and the strangeness of the Universe is somehow revealed. Oh, but you'll have to study. You'll have to change opinions. You'll have to search and prove. And no, not that, when there are big books and imposing persons that clearly tell you how things are and if you ask anything more they'll kill you. Because after all, what are they going to make a living out of?, if they can't do anything but recite old sayings, collect funds, listen to naughty tales and rape kids. Dawkins employ a mix of sicence, history, and common sense to bury the Devil: religion.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|Even though I was a longtime fan of the old ST, I gave this one a chance.  It was a very good film (as the first in what will no doubt be a series).  All but one of the characters was spot on - McCoy was a delight (and in my opinion the best of a very talented cast).  My only beef with the character casting was Chekov.  The guy was WAY goofy, did not even attempt to look the part (unlike the others), and despite the actor's background seemed to come across as a Russian trying to play a Russian.  One can hope that when the next film is made they'll re-cast.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it was well thought-out.  The plot was a bit weak - understandable since we need to be introduced to everybody - but the execution was great.  At times we get a bit too much trivia thrown at us but that's OK, at least the filmmakers cared to include it for old trekkers like me.  Spock, both original and younger, are excellent.  We expect this from Nimoy, of course, but get Zachary Quinto as a bonus.  He was fortunate to have Nimoy since it allowed him to talk to the man who created the role while his fellow cast had to rely on film history.  Not that this is bad, since aside from Chekov the rest have their roles down pat.<br /><br />Only two things bugged me, and I have to get them off my chest:  The Kobiashi Maru bit; we know Kirk cheated, but I've always felt he probably played it cool and just went in and rescued the ship.  Pine's Kirk acts the whole time like it's no big deal, way more smug then Kirk probably would have been.  The old Kirk would have been smug, yes, but most likely showing it after the test was over.<br /><br />The second thing was the engine room of the Enterprise.  The rest of the ship looked good and futuristic, but why all the boiler-room pipes in the engine room?  I know that the payoff was having Scotty beam into the waterpipe, but at what expense? The whole set took away from the sense of reality and I felt hurt the picture.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun, well made film that will be a welcome addition to my Star Trek catalog.  Even if you're an old trekker like me - see it!  It's the logical thing to do.ill be a welcome addition to my Star Trek catalog.  Even if you're an old trekker like me - see it!

B00192IV0O|3.0|The Black Eyed Peas latest cd is great. Very funky and cool. The E.N.D. is just the beginning.
B001HN69AE|3.0|Simply put, this movie was fun to watch in the regard that it had action, a bit of suspense, and lots of fun, mindless destruction. It wasn't supposed to fully follow the line of the anime, as the creator of DBZ himself stated that it is a re-imagining, not something that was supposed to be a perfect match. Overall, it wasn't the best movie by far, but if you go in without the lofty expectations and just watch it for the action, it's good for a bit of entertainment.
0061231401|5.0|I've read all of the author's books so far, and I can say that they have never disappointed me. The Doomsday Key rates high on the list in terms of thrills, action, and suspense. It's got James Rollins' signature twists and turns that leave you wondering what's actually going on, right up to the end. The gasp factor is ever present as he takes you on a roller coaster ride through history and science, never pausing for breath. Add some terrific character development, fascinating locations, and revelations about history you won't find in many textbooks, and this was definitely one wild ride.<br /><br />The basis for all of his books is truth, mixed with a healthy dose of what-ifs. This combination, and the truths that he shows us in Doomsday Key, made this one terrifying read for me. Above and beyond the fictional aspect was a sense that something like what's being described could actually happen. Someone out there could be doing exactly what the author writes, and most of us would never know it. The thoughts of the science involved have kept me up nights wondering, long after I finished the book. What was real, and what was the author's imagination?<br /><br />I think this was my favorite of all his books to date. It's left me wondering if even Mr. Rollins himself can top it.
0060734191|5.0|I originally got these books as a present for Christmas I flew through them and I have been recommending this trilogy to everyone I know. I bought these copies for my sister with prime so she received them in just 2 days. Garth Nix is a great author and these books were a real joy to read. The only time I was disappointed was when I finished the final book.  I suggest that anyone give these books a try, you won't be sorry!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Like many people, I heard \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" on the radio long before I even know who she was.  Thought it was a novelty act.    Took a chance on the album, based on a friend's recommendation and was amazed at how great it is.  Lots of really catchy, well-written songs that have that \\"novelty\\" on one level, but are a lot deeper when you take a closer look.    I have a lot of music in my collection and rarely listen to an album more than a handful of times.  This is one of the few that I go back to again and again.    Can't wait to see what's next from Katy Perry!
B00243FQFA|2.0|The specialFX continue to get better and the writing continues to get worse. With Stargate Atlantis Season 5, the long legacy of the Stargate series goes out with a whimper and a bang.    Season Five's episodes are divided down a very clear line, with a handful being enjoyable, and the other half being pointless side plots with lackluster writing and absolutely no bearing on the continuing story.    Even the \\"good\\" episodes have an air of repetativeness, a heavy reliance on \\"Rodney Ex Machina,\\" and repeatedly fail to live up to their potential. The plots and dialog reek of writers who just don't care anymore. The stories fall flat and the moments of character development are sparse and glossed over.    The \\"First Contact\\" / \\"The Lost Tribe\\" pair of episodes were the high-point of this season. The writing was slightly more solid and the CGI sequences were some of the coolest the show has ever done.    The series finale was suitably awesome in concept, but rushed production and time constraints ruined even that last ray of hope. The producers even admitted in the episode commentary that \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" should have been a THREE PART episode, but instead the plot was crammed into a single episode and while it is an enjoyable episode, it only stands out because of the abominably low quality of many of the other episodes.    On the flipside, the CGI space battles are vastly superior to anything Atlantis has had before. The sequences are truly beautiful in their own right, but the artistic grace of these scenes only serves to highlight how far the other aspects of the show have fallen.    Worth the purchase to complete your collection, but expect nothing more than mindless entertainment.
0312330863|5.0|I've read them all, and I think this is the best of the four. I've certainly re-read it the most. Herriot tells tales on all sorts of animals, and people--rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, doctor, lawyer, merchant chief. He looks on them with a kindly eye, and you never forget the people or the animals. I have many favorites. One group is the 3 tales he tells of himself, a small man and rather a Boy Scout, trying to party with Granville Bennett, an overpowering party animal no man can keep up wit--but you get the feeling Herriot enjoyed trying, like many of us guys would. Maybe the best is the tale where he and his future wife cross that imaginary line between knowing one another and becoming a couple. TO a romantic sod like me, who remembers the night my wife and I joyously crossed that point of no return, that one is just a delight. Even stories i've read a dozen times and more can still have me laughing until I cry, or crying until I just have to start laughing again. More readable than Jean Shepherd, more intelligent than Dave Barry, this man was wonderfully funny, and his stories will live on for many decades, I hope.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Wow!  This series is very addicting.  I bought the dvd set since the people i live with do not like vampires and would not let me watch it but now when they are gone for the day i have a trublood marathon.  can not wait for session 2 to come out on dvd.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is what Star Trek should have been a long time ago. While I love the original films and series with all my heart... this \\"re-invention\\" captures everything that made the old Star Treks classic and also introduces the new age of modern cinema into the picture. This movie is phenomenal in every distinctive way. I couldn't believe how well thought out and put together this film was. A masterpiece. The new characters resemble the old characters and revive their distinctive roles again while adding a more realistic and plausible sense of human nature that is what make us human beings in the first place. For those who bash this movie, they are too stuck on the old and are not open to new ideas. Kind of like my mom and dad not listening to new music. However, I like it all! Bring me more of this kind of STAR TREK!!!
0307588335|5.0|The collapse of Lehman Brothers is seen as the pivotal event that led to the economic collapse of 2008 and much press has been devoted to the exact chronology of how Lehman came to fail.  But it takes inside knowledge to really get into the corporate psychology, culture and the psyche of the employees and Larry McDonald is that person.  A farmer Vice President at Lehman, McDonald has the knowledge and insight to know what led Lehman to take the actions that ultimately led to its demise and McDonald repeats quite convincingly here his central premise as to what led to the collapse; that it wasn't a large number employees, but only eight, including CEO Richard Fuld.  It was the investment strategy of this small coterie of employees that overextended Lehman's holdings of credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and derivatives that ultimately led to Lehman's desperate need to de-leverage and quickly seek an infusion of capital.  McDonald paints a portrait of detached and distant senior executives who created an almost separate lair at Lehman's headquarters that only served to increase their detachment.  In turn these leaders inculcated a culture of relentless demand for results led employees to take greater risks and in turn fostered a culture of greed.<br /><br />McDonald's tale of `mission creep' when it comes to declining ethics is a familiar tale whether it is WorldCom, Enron or Lehman.  But at times his premise seems a bit conflicted: if the truly destructive forces at Lehman were limited to these eight employees alone then why focus on the broader culture of declining ethics?  Weren't those declining ethics equally responsible for Lehman's collapse?  Can someone so close to the situation really be objective in analysis and conclusions?  McDonald certainly does seem to have done his homework on the research and there are some genuine bombshells in here, especially the meeting between then CEO Richard Fuld and then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson regarding Lehman's de-leveraging. The upshot of the meeting was Fuld sharply criticized Paulson both personally and professionally, and McDonald posits that it was this interchange that likely led to Paulson's decision not to intervene to save Lehman Brothers.  Given recent developments with Paulson regarding Merrill Lynch's shotgun marriage with Bank of America the veracity of McDonald's story seems to be increasingly true.<br /><br />While there is a flood of books on the economic collapse, the best ones more narrowly focus on specific players as it's easier to follow microeconomic stories than macroeconomic ones.  \\"A Colossal Failure...\\" follows in the tradition of great books such as \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" about the takeover of RJR Nabisco or \\"The Smartest Guys in the Room\\" about the Enron fiasco.  \\"A Colossal Failure...\\" is very well written and well researched, but it is also a chilling look into not only McDonalds psyche, but those of his compatriots on Wall Street.  No one wakes up in the morning plotting how to destroy their company that day, but the erosion of ethics is so gradual that many wind up doing things they ultimately come to regret dearly.  The damage to their resumes, to their credibility, and their ability to find a new job is often irreversible.  To varying degrees McDonald partially succeeds in his argument that it was the gang of eight, who he names in the book, which ultimately brought Lehman Brothers down.  But to a larger degree it was many of the employees, himself included, who were the willing participants that changed to corporate culture to one of unbridled greed that ultimately led to the fall.  \\"A Colossal Failure...\\" is at once a roman a clef and a cautionary tale to all of corporate America; this too could be you if you're not careful!Lehman's de-leveraging.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Remember my review of The Wizard of Oz on how heartwarming it is? Well, oh boy, let's talk about the long-awaited spin-off sequel, Return to Oz. For starters, it is quite a departure from its predecessor and more like the big kid version of Oz. It is rated PG, it is dark, a little scary, and is not a musical at all. Six months later, Dorthy (Fairuza Balk) is so obsessed with her adventures in Oz that she had difficulty sleeping and Em (Piper Laurie) is worried. Em drops Dorthy off at a mental clinic in the care of Dr. Worley (Nicol Willamson) and Head Nurse Wilson (Jean Marsh). As they are about to treat Dorthy's condition with electroshock therapy, the power goes out and a mysterious girl (Emma Ridley) warns her about the other patients taking on brain damage and helps her escape to safety. Head Nurse Wilson chases them to a river, where the mysterious girl disappeared and Dorthy hitched a ride in a crib and the drift takes her back to Oz. Once Dorthy awakens, she sees Billina, one of the chickens from the farm who can now talk human (dialogue provided by Denise Bryer). They discover that Munchkinland disappeared, The Yellow Brick Road was damaged, Emerald City is in ruins with everyone turned into stone, especially the Tin Woodsman (Deep Roy) and the Cowardly Lion (John Alexander), and the Scarecrow (Justin Case) is missing. A gang of Wheelers chased after the two since Dorthy is being targeted by the Gnome King (also Willamson) and Mombi (also Ridley) and that the Gnome King does not permit chickens in Oz. Dorthy meets a wind-up robot Tik-Tok (voice of Sean Barrett) and the three encounter Mombi who imprisons them in a tower where they meet Jack Pumpkinhead (voice of Brian Henson). The gang formulate an escape plan to get to the Gnome King's Mountain to rescue Scarecrow. Dorthy steals a bottle of life powder from the storage compartment of Mombi's original head, while the others put together a flying sofa with the head of a gump. Dorthy brings the Gump (voice ofLyle Conway) to life. Together, the group fly to the mountain where they discover that the Scarecrow tried to save the emeralds of Emerald City from the Gnome King's clutches, but the Gnome King got revenge by transforming him into an ornament. When Dorthy returned to Kansas, she was so anxious to return home that she forgot to remove the ruby slippers and they fell off her feet and landed into the Gnome King's hands. In other words, the onset of Oz's destruction was Dorthy's fault. They rescue the Scarecrow and the Gnome King tries to eat everyone. Fortunately, Billina, who was hiding in Jack's head, drops an egg into the King's throat. Since chicken eggs contain an acid substance that is quite harmful to gnomes, the Gnome King crumbles to pieces. Dorthy equips the slippers and teleports the group out of the rumbling mountain and back to the restored Emerald City where Mombi was captured. Dorthy frees the mysterious girl that previously rescued her in the beginning, revealed to be Princess Ozma. Ozma uses the slippers to return Dorthy to Kansas, after saying goodbye to everyone, for now. Dorthy wakes up in a river bank where she was found by Toto (Tansy), Em, and Henry (Matt Clark). The visual effects were an improvement. They were more advanced and complex. The animatronics were pulled off really well. The stone gnomes that used clay animation were quite original. They did a good job mixing the claymation and real-life motion together. There were a few plot holes as well. The original ended with the house still in Kansas, but in the sequel the house was not. While Dorthy seemed to be in her mid-teens with Em and Henry in their late 40's in the original, but in this sequel they looked noticeably younger (pretty close to the books). The Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion were humanoid in the original which helps them display facial expressions, but in this entry, they looked more accurate to the books and hardly has such expressions. Even though both films are great classics, the original just barely wins. While this sequel had a deeper and darker storyline with better visual effects, the original had more heart to it with memorable songs thrown into the mix. If you see any of these films in rental stores, please buy or rent them. They don't disappoint.
055380684X|4.0|Daniel Coyle poses a series of fascinating questions in this book:<br />1.  What does it mean to be talented at something?  Is one simply genetically endowed with superior gifts(lucky)or is it a product of one's environment and training -- and what role does motivation play in whether or not one becomes a 'genius' at something?<br />2.  Why do certain environments seem to produce a lot of geniuses?  Is there something special about that place or the activities that go one there?  what exactly is a 'hotbed' of talent?<br /><br />Coyle's book is the result of some theorizing and a great deal of empirical research.  In preparing this book, his travels took him to a town in the Dominican Republic that produces a top-rate Little League team every year;  a tennis training camp in Moscow, Russia that has produced twenty tennis prodigies;  a music camp in upstate New York where Joshua Bell, Yo Yo Ma and others were nurtured;  and a number of high performing elementary schools in California and New York.<br /><br />The puzzle he presents is this:  it's statistically unlikely for so MANY talented novelists, artists, musicians or sportsmen to simply appear randomly within the population in these places -- so clearly there is some other effect at work.  (He mentions the Brontes, for example.  How did one obscure town produce THREE world-class novelists, all within the same family?)And it's not resources, he makes clear.  Many of the environments he describes are run-down and austere, simple places, not the \\"athlete factories\\" we hear about in places like china.<br /><br />What's inspiring about the book is that he attributes a lot of genius to plain old hard work, superior practice habits and a high degree of internal motivation.  He speaks a lot about neuroscience and the ways in which pathways in the brain are built through practicing endless, boring mindless repetitions of scales, tennis serves or dance moves.  In general, these people aren't smarter than you or me -- they're just more disciplined.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the heavy emphasis on how one needs to be internally motivated suggests that one might be able to improve one's own talents -- but it would be difficult to inspire someone else (say, for example, your children) to work harder and practice harder unless you were that rarest of creatures, the extremely talented teacher.e just more disciplined.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the heavy emphasis on how one needs to be internally motivated suggests that one might be able to improve one's own talents -- but it would be difficult to inspire someone else (say, for example, your children) to work harder and practice harder unless you were that rarest of creatures, the extremely talented teacher.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|I thought I had to wait until 09/09/09 to purchase another album, but hearing demoes of these new Lovato jams made me buy the new disc!  It is a must have for everybody.  The debut album, while cool and showcased Lovato's potential, was too Jonas-izated for my tastes.  This new disc isn't, and the jams are so cool, just like Lovato herself!<br /><br />I thought the theme song to \\"Sonny\\" would've ruined it but after repeated listens it is great that it finishes the album.  Perfect record!  A winner!<br /><br />By the way, just like the first disc, Tommy Barbarella and Michael B from The NPG perform in a couple jams.
0307454541|5.0|This book is a page-turner and one that I couldn't put down.  It is indeed unfortunate that such a major talent was taken from us so soon.  Believe me, I will be reading his other two books that he submitted with this one as soon as they are are released in English.  Lisbeth Salander is a heroine like no other.  She sports numerous tattoos on her body, and she hides her superior intelligence, computer wizardry and photographic memory behind a slightly bored and inimitable exterior.  Mikail Blomkivst is an investigative journalist who works with this strange young woman to uncover some truly reprehensible family secrets of a fairly upper crust Swedish family.  I love the way Stieg Larson portrayed his characters.  I love they way each of them is forced to face their own particular demons.  This is such an excellent novel that the quite wonderful thriller aspect is almost overshadowed.  What a wonderful talent this man had!!
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters is a fine film and I recommend it. It has fiber, moral fiber, and lots of it. The Amazon review contains the structure of the movie. And I don't have anything original to say except that I think you should get it, watch it, and let the film's magic unfold in front of you. You won't be disappointed.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'm so glad this series is coming on DVD! I hope that this comes with some good making of bonus features because in watching the show you can tell that there was an incredible amount of work put into the production of each episode. I love this show. The episodes are fun and magical yet have lots of compelling drama. I love Richard and Kahlan in this show. Bridget and Craig who play them do great in their roles and have really great chemistry. If you missed this show when it was on ABC and like stuff like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings watch it on Hulu or get the DVD. Just don't judge the show by the first few episodes. It takes a little bit to get going and by episode 5 I was totally hooked!!
159562015X|3.0|This book was helpful in finding my strengths, but if you're looking for more than that, it's not helpful.  I was expecting to have career options offered, but that's an additional cost.  The second half of the book is the same material that you get from your printout online, so you really end up only reading half the book!  I would have liked it to be more specific to career choices, but it wasn't.
B000001Y5D|5.0|I feel like I found a gem in the haystack of one-shot albums. This is a high quality recording with great sound to match the powerful lyrics, vocals!!, and instruments (drums and guitar are ripping). There is one ballad, but mostly high energy music with each song distinctly it's own and literally giving you \\"Bigger, Better, Faster, More!\\". It's sad there is not \\"More!\\" albums from this band, but I sure am happy I found this album.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|This is a very long, dull, irritating movie. The characters are inconsistent, the dialogue inane, plot points take forever to resolve even though you can see what's going to happen thirty minutes in advance. Even the acting is pedestrian, and Jack Black has the romantic appeal of a bed fart.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|4.2 stars<br /><br />Short version: The man who directed What About Bob? and did the voices of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Yoda makes a comedy about a funeral featuring accidental psychedelic ingestion and an extortionate gay midget (sorry, dwarf). If that doesn't pique your curiosity, this is not for you.<br /><br />Slightly longer version: Wonderfully off the wall British drawing-room farce writ somewhat large, with perfectly silly script and superlative cast. Director Oz was raised in Britain and it shows; he melds dry Brit wit with some of the better Hollywood tropes and dishes up an oft hilarious film that gets funnier as it goes, and at a pleasantly snappy pace. Tudyk is especially marvellous as the unknowing voyager.<br /><br />A must for any fans of British humor, gleeful weirdness, and intelligent dry wit in general.
B001NMAFXQ|4.0|I listened to FTWHH before this CD, so I was expecting this to be just as good, until I read the reviews on here. It is well worth the 8 dollars Amazon wants for it, I would pay a little more for it, if i paid for my music :P. You won't be disappointed either way.
B0000019HU|5.0|I might go so far as to call this the best album of the 90s.  It's certainly my favorite by far.  Slint's \\"Spiderland\\" harkens back to a time when the term \\"indie\\" meant independent, both in commercial terms and in terms of aesthetic.  Before indie became a marketing term to sell iPods, there were a handful of bands rewriting rock music; Slint stand at, or very near, the forefront of those bands.  And \\"Spiderland\\" is their masterpiece.<br /><br />The music contained herein is very spare and minimal: voice, guitar, bass, drums. Songs are more cyclical than linear, the vocals are more spoken than sung, and there is very little in the instrumentation that would suggest \\"normal\\" rock music. Jagged, almost atonal guitar parts, and a lockstep bass/drums rhythm section suggest forerunners like Wire, Gang of Four, and Fugazi, but Slint developed their own take on the angular post-punk sound.  The track \\"Good Morning, Captain\\" really captures Slint's unique sound, which has since been imitated by countless bands.  For influence alone, \\"Spiderland\\" is worth your attention.<br /><br />The songwriting on this album is really quite spectacular.  Having been so widely imitated in the nearly 20(!) years since its release, it's easy to forget that in 1991, few if any albums sounded like \\"Spiderland\\".  The obscure mini-novels that make up the lyrical content was unheard-of, and makes for some thrilling listening.  Instrumentally, this is some of the most hypnotic, compulsively listenable music in rock, managing to be exciting without being unsubtle. The riffs consist of minimal, angular riffs, with counterpoint bass and cascading drums, very unlike the punk/hardcore and blues influenced rock that was then, as now, so prevalent But \\"Spiderland\\" possesses that X-factor that makes it more than the sum of its constituent parts,  when everything comes together, it's just unbelievable.<br /><br />I rate this album so highly, however, not merely due to unorthodox sonics or songwriting, revolutionary though they were.  This album, for me, and many other listeners, holds an emotional significance reserved for truly momentous albums.  Virtually everyone who has heard \\"Spiderland\\" will remember the first time they listened to this album.  For me, it was the fall of my freshmen year in college--listening to this album between classes, walking in the cold, unsure of myself, filled with the usual late adolescent/early adult confusion, etc--and this album is still evocative of that time and place.  It holds special significance for that very reason.<br /><br />Perhaps you, dear reader, heard about this album from Pitchfork or some other hip blog.  Maybe you've heard as being touted as the first \\"post-\\" or \\"math-\\" rock album.  But this album is far more significant than any \\"coolness factor\\" or influential status that has been bestowed upon it.  It is, simply, an amazing rock album from start to finish. Slint's \\"Spiderland\\" is truly one of the best albums of the 90s.  Buy/steal/acquire however you can.  Standout cuts \\"Breadcrumb Trail\\", \\"Don, Aman,\\" and \\"Good Morning, Captain.\\"  For fans of: Shellac, the Jesus Lizard, early Fugazi, Wire, Gang of Four.ere.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Sometimes entertaining film.  I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  Too much girl dialogue in the 2nd half caused the film to drag a bit.  Alot of action, cute dialogue, but no plot (which is usual for a Tarantino movie).  Kurt Russell does a good job.  If you like Tarantino, you'll probably like this movie.  Don't expect too much; I didn't.
1400032717|4.0|A first person narrative from the perspective of an autistic savant, this is a fine book. Successful on most levels and a satisfying read, it's well worth reading for anyone who knows autistic kids or parents, and these days that's a lot of people.<br /><br />I found parts of it quite moving, and parts quite depressing...but realistic depictions of daily British city life will do that. Haddon paints a solid portrait of our unlikely hero and it's hard not to end up loving the kid a whole bunch.<br /><br />A quick and enjoyable read with layers of emotional depth; well worth sharing with your adolescent kids. It's never too early to help them accept all types of people and all levels of intellectual ability.
B001TOVZYQ|4.0|Donnie Yen truly shines in this movie about the great Master Yip Man's life.  This movie had a lot of heart and made the best of the small time it had devoted to drama.  Donnie Yen really proves that he can act quite well for a Hong Kong action hero.  The family scenes were endearing and later quite heart wrenching depictions of the plight of the Chinese during their occupation.  He also does a great job of expressing the physical ideas of Wing Chun within the framework of this movie.  The ensemble cast especially the character actors and Northern Shaolin master make great use of their screen time.  Most Hong Kong movies fall flat on their face dramatically and I think thats a huge barrier to Western audiences.  This movie is solid in both regards which is both rare and encouraging.  Many people reference [[ASIN:B000K2UW06 Jet Li's Fearless (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] as a better movie but I'm forced to disagree.  As much as I love Jet Li he is way past his prime in that movie and this is really Donnie Yen at his best.    I have two small gripes with this movie.  The Japanese General's martial arts are a bit disappointing after seeing esentially the same character in [[ASIN:B001AR0D1S Fist of Legend]] tear it up.  Though his acting was a lot better and he has never done a martial arts film before this. The bonus features were generally great but the commentaries by the individuals on the bonus disc are redundant if you watch the \\"making of\\" video.  All in all Ip Man was a great and memorable addition to the Hong Kong cinema lexicon.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I was there when the first Stat Trek showed on TV with my kids watching intently.  I've seen it as long as they have filmed it though I must say, I wasn't into changing to new Generation, DS9, etc.  It took a while for me to warm up to the idea Shatner was there for only so long, and in the ensuing years I warmed to them all, but this!  This took me over the edge into a whole new world I cant really describe.  Im 72 and I am wowed by this film.      If you dont like it you are too jaded to simply look at an awesome movie and come out renewed.  All the characters, with the exception of Checkov were totally believable, Bones and Spock seemed spooned from identical replicas of the originals.  How cool is that?  I sure hope they bring them back for a couple more, these kids have it down to a fine science.  Please see this movie, and if you dont like it, you should move from the planet.
B001CISHU4|5.0|There is so many positive things I could say about this album that I know not where to begin. I have been listening to Amon Amarth for years now and I have not been disappointed in any release. As far as musicianship is concerned I dare say this is a step ahead of their previous releases. For example the sheer brutality 'The Crusher' possessed is shown in this album, but of course in a different sense.<br /><br />Amon Amarth have always blended masterfully their lyrics and instrumentals. Their lyrics are mighty indeed, and their instrumentals bring them further into an even more epic light. So go ahead and satisfy your inner viking with this masterpiece.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|4.29 stars<br />(And recommended by four out of five dentists)<br /><br />There are definitely moments of real glory here, mainly from Hamm, who really brings home the bacon. He sells the sizzle and the steak as well. The rest of the cast is quite fine but he carries this puppy and does a very good job, showing far more depth than is common in tv acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this show has Six Feet Under-itis: it comes out of the gate at a full gallop in the pilot and then slowly loses steam, until by the end of the first season it's still a fine show but has lost the magic of its early moments. It looks technicolor-lush and 50s/60s surreal throughout, though, to its great credit. Big props to the art designers on MadMen; it's as slick as its subject.<br /><br />Matt Weiner writes some gorgeous lines (\\"He'd rather be a whiner than a weener?\\" said the missus when he said his name on the commentary), and there are occasional moments of extreme lucidity regarding the America dream. For that alone this series deserves serious praise. That it slowly floats into soap opera-ish territory is unfortunate but mildly inevitable; series that start this strong and never fade are few indeed.<br /><br />But those first few shows are tremendous, and this is in general many cuts above the norm; I'll take whatever knowing irony I can get these days, as the oblivious irony is endemic. Brutally honest revisionist history is a rare thing on American television and is always praiseworthy, especially when done with such loving care.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon never seem to disappoint me at all whatsoever. They are one of the best heavy metal bands to come out in some recent memory. I have all of Mastodon's previous albums, and they've been one of my favorite bands since then. These guys just keep getting better and better with each album they put out. The Georgia quartet's latest masterpiece entitled \\"Crack the Skye\\" is a brilliantly incredible follow up to their 2006 groundbreaking classic \\"Blood Mountain\\", and it's also their best and most accessible album thus far. I bought this album back in April (a day before Easter), and it immediately won me over since then, I just love it. Clocking in at a little over 50 minutes, and with seven wonderful songs, this entire album is like an absolute out-of-body experience, it's that good believe me. With top-notch production from Brendan O'Brien, incredible musicianship, and brilliant lyrical subject matter from Czarist Russia during the time of Grigori Rasputin and astral travel to out-of-body experiences and Stephen Hawking's theories on wormholes. The album's cover artwork which was done by Paul Romano is just incredible. The album's title has also been described as a homage to drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye who committed suicide at the age of 14. Troy Sanders (who also plays bass as always) and guitarist Brent Hinds both adopt a more cleaner vocal approach on this album, and they both do a great job at it too, while there are some screaming still present on tunes such as \\"Divinations\\" and the title track, and Brann Dailor also lends some vocals on the opening cut \\"Oblivion\\" as well. The guitars of Hinds and Bill Kelliher are in top form here, as they both charge their way through the album with amazingly technical riffs and perfectly executed solos as well. Dailor's drumming is just simply impeccable, death defying and flat out amazing. He is truly one of the best drummers in metal today, there's no question that he's got the stuff.<br /><br />The opening song \\"Oblivion\\" begins with a lightly down-tuned guitar intro, and then goes into a serious straight-up metal fest with some beefier riffs, crazy drumwork here and there, and fantastic vocals by Dailor who sings the verses, then Sanders comes in with the bridge, and Hinds joins in with the chorus which is very catchy, and there's an awesome solo at 3:34 as well. The next song and the albums's first single \\"Divinations\\" is highlighted by a cool banjo intro, and then kicks into a catchy headbanging upbeat tempo, awesome galloping riffs, nice screaming vocals, and an addicting clean sung chorus, and the solo in the middle is great too. Next up, we have \\"Quintessence\\" which is highlighted by a catchy semi-melodic guitar riff that is played throughout, as well as some jarring time shifts and crazy off the hook drumming from Dailor. The fourth track \\"The Czar\\" is a majestic 10+ minute epic that is broken down into four parts: Usurper, Escape, Martyr, and Spiral. I just love how the song starts off spacey and mellow with acoustic lines, humming basslines and a slow and steady beat, and it continues on until it launches into an addictingly unstoppable groove around 3:45 with awesome catchy riffage, and hard pounding drum beats, and then around the 7 minute mark, the song goes back to some acoustic guitar lines which are quickly followed by the band's trademark riffs all leading up to a wonderfully executed guitar solo, before going back to the opening lyrics one last time. The fifth track \\"Ghost of Karelia\\" is a wonderful and haunting cut that features some of Dailor's best drumwork on the entire album in my opinion, while the title track featuring Scott Kelly of the awesome Neurosis is a powerful and awe-inspiring epic that is highlighted by slow, sludgy riffs, commanding screamed verses, and amazingly addicting clean sung choruses with solid double bass pedal action backing them up, and there's also a fancy solo thrown in as well. This is definately my personal favorite song thewhole album, I just love it. Every time I hear the clean choruses, I just can't help but sing along to them. And last, but certainly not least, the album ends with the 13 minute progressive epic \\"The Last Baron\\" which is truly in my opinion one of the best songs that Mastodon have written and composed. Vocals, guitars, bass, and drums are definately 100% top notch throughout this monster of a song, and that guitar solo near the end is just amazing as well.<br /><br />Favorite songs: Crack the Skye, Divinations, Oblivion, The Czar, and The Last Baron.<br /><br />If there was a certain album that I would pick for best metal album of 2009, then in all seriousness, \\"Crack the Skye\\" definately gets my pick. I love how Mastodon have the ability to mature and evolve from album to album, and this album shows it, believe me. This is definately Mastodon's best and most accessible album to date like I mentioned before in the beginning. It's an absolute out-of-body experience that will captivate your mind from beginning to end, it is that good. Highly recommended for all fans of Mastodon and fans of metal alike Rock On!!album, I just love it. Every time I hear the clean choruses, I just can't help but sing along to them.

B001TH16DI|3.0|I don't have many complaints about the video quality of the HD video transfer, overall it's pretty good.  The film transfer for \\"Undiscovered Country\\" could have been better, film jitter was easily noticeable.  Some of the older movies don't look too much better than upscaled DVD's, but that probably can't be helped.  In the case of Star Trek III, the HD transfer is so faithful to the original movie that one can easy see the compositing artifacts for some of the special effects, making them even more distracting.  (For example, the clipping boundaries around the Enterprise while it's entering and leaving the space station.)  That being said, it was neat being able to clearly make out fine details for movies which I'd previously only been able to see only  in standard definition.<br /><br />The main menus are all the same canned 3D animation of the federation insignia, set to theme music from each movie.  Thus, they offer almost no \\"flavor\\" and are pretty boring.  Most frustrating is that each disc automatically plays a trailer for the new Star Trek movie (not even the \\"best\\" trailer), followed by another for the HD release of the original series.  I can forgive an automated advertising assault when I buy used DVD's which were probably once rental DVD's.  However, when it's something I purchased new, it feels like a big corporate slap in the face, every time I see it.  It gets old real quick--real classy, Paramount.  Minus one star just for that.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|When I went to see Star Trek in theatres I originally gave it an awful review. Mainly due to, what I thought at the time, it's not remaining true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.    I had an opportunity to see the movie again and was able to analyze it more thoroughly than I did when I saw it in theaters. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my original conclusions were mistaken.    Ultimately, there is so much that is right with Star Trek that after seeing it a second time it's flaws are not many and do not overshadow the greatness of this movie.     Star Trek centers on two main characters, Kirk and Spock, who are both united in the loss of one of their parents. Kirk with the loss of his father and Spock with the loss of his mother.     Yet it is the loss both men feel that initially holds them back. After being challenged Kirk ends up casting off his baggage to embrace the true leader that he is, while Spock learns to balance his Human-Vulcan traits.     Rather than being a disability Spock's being half human turns out to be his greatest strength and, like Kirk, learns to deal with his loss and get on with his chosen path of serving in Starfleet.     Like Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock), the supporting characters are really good and passionate in their roles while each has a great sense of life.     Uhura (Zoe Saldana) is sexy and feminine but strong willed. Sulu (John Cho) has a good supporting role and (fortunately) is not limited to only being helmsman. Chekov (Anton Yelchin) is a youthful genius, while Scotty (Simon Pegg) is true to his original character as a miracle worker with humor to boot.     I loved Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy. I could see he put alot of time and effort into his portrayal of Bones in which he gave an admirable rendition.     The Spock-Uhura romance was a good idea too. I later realized that the script authors got this from the inter-racial kiss Kirk and Uhura shared in \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\". Originally, Uhura was to kiss Spock in the episode but producers at the time had her kiss Kirk instead.     Star Trek is very quick-paced. The reason why is that this version is mainly character-driven while trying to balance the need for special effects and story line.    I also concur with the observation of a review named Nick Farrantello who stated that throughout the film, the characters are faced with making important choices in their own lives.     In almost every scene of the film it is individuals (from Kirk to Spock to Nero) who weigh their options, choose their course of action and either come out ahead by embracing change or, like what happens with Nero, continue to be slaves to the past.     It is individuals who control their destiny. As Farrantello points out, people are not controlled by history and can change course at any time. That is the underlying theme of Star Trek.     I also loved the prominent role technology played too. Since Gene Roddenberry used Star Trek as his platform to champion science and space exploration, technology is essential for both fields and it is fitting technology is a central feature of his brainchild.     Technology, however, is not held as intrinsic. The usage of it, while glamorous, still shows how the characters' useage of technology to solve problems and achieve things. It is also the result of the usage of their logic and reason which is Star Trek's essence and the driving force of it's characters.     I discovered Star Trek while flipping through television channels as a kid and happened upon the episode The Doomsday Machine. After seeing it and the positive vision of the future it portrayed, I was instantly hooked.     I was also fortunate enough to have seen The Animated Series as part of my Saturday morning cartoon routine, saw all 6 films with the original cast and saw the first four seasons of The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager when they were broadcast on television.     Each series, like this new film, charted it's ownbold course in it's own right.     J.J. Abrams and his associates have maintained Star Trek's essential elements in order to, hopefully, chart Star Trek to new voyages with new ideas.     Star Trek is not only a science fiction tale and culture, but also an exploration as to what it means to be an individual. It is a positive vision of the future and what mankind can achieve.     Live long, and prosper!
079073804X|4.0|This movie is definitely not recommended for kids say, below 13 years of age? I thought my 11-year old will have fun watching it with me . . . I was wrong. I had to turn our player off after 15 minutes into the movie. But I really enjoyed watching it with adult guests.
037571457X|2.0|It's beyond horrible that anybody has to grow up in that scenario, especially children! The problem I had with the story is that I found the main character pretty much unlikeable. I have children so I am aware that kids aren't exactly a big bundle of tactfulness but telling another little girl that her father is probably dead is reprehensible. If you factor in that she is 9 or 10 and not 5 or 6 years old it makes her comment seem more hateful than tactless. She also came off as taking pleasure in other people's misery. I didn't like her parents either. Considering all the turmoil in their country I was pretty much astounded that they decided to take a vacation for just the two of them while leaving the daughter behind. I can't even imagine parting from my children under those circumstances.

Very entertaining reading to the non-English.  I never knew anthropology could be this interesting!!!

0380973839|4.0|Now I know where Rod Serling got the idea for \\"The Twilight Zone.\\"  I listened to an audiobook of this, and  was an excellent experience, and it had the added value of being a favorite from my youth.  These stories focus on a series of American expeditions to Mars. However, it is a different Mars for each group of astronauts, in some cases anyway.  Certain stories refer back to previous ones, others seem to stand alone.  The planet sometimes has the same features in different stories. Each time it is a dreamlike experience, and one that seems to harken back to the small town midwest or west.  There are Martians, but they vary from story to story.  In each piece, you get the feeling that humanity has journeyed into space to confront some sort of inner space - loneliness, for example.    Bradbury plays with time and space to create little stages, settings for his vignettes about commercialization and race relations and alienation. Like a lot of great science fiction, \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" deals with the issues of the present in an imagined future.  Bradbury's writing still possesses a good deal of its power today.  These stories feature classic American motifs - square-jawed, masculine heroes, simple dialogue, the struggle of man against nature - yet these elements are twisted into strange shapes that, despite being a little corny, are still fascinating.

B00288KNLS|4.0|Coraline is a clever and inventive young girl, whose overworked and absent-minded parents tend to ignore her.  She discovers a portal into elsewhere, with an other mother who is all too eager to please.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Luckily, Coraline's got the courage and pluck to face up to the absurdity and horror she faces on the other side.  Based on Neil Gaiman's inventive modern children's classic, it's a brilliant stop-motion adaptation, comparable in depth and theme and mystery to Lewis Carroll's [[ASIN:144042909X Alice In Wonderland]] and Hayao Miyazaki's [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]].<br /><br />I saw this in 3-D in theaters, and just finished watching the 3-D version of the DVD on TV - on a 42\\" LCD flat screen, which may account for part of why it looked so good.  I was very impressed by the 3-D look - this is the first time I've seen a home version 3-D that really worked.  Of course the theatrical 3-D version was the first one I'd seen that didn't feel like a gimmick.  There are moments of \\"in your face\\" shock designed to surprise and impress - but what's really impressive is  the immersive character of the world.  It feels like a lived-in fantastic world with depth and texture - quite exciting.  The music sets just the right mood.  The voices are perfectly meshed with the characters - and unlike many contemporary animated films don't call attention to themselves.  I never once thought \\"that's Dakota Fanning\\" or \\"Terri Hatcher.\\"<br /><br />While the colors seem slightly muted in the DVD's 3-D version, the depth is definitely there, and it looks nearly perfect if you watch it in the dark, as recommended.  This DVD set comes with 4 3D glasses, and includes both the 2D and 3D versions of the film, plus a digital version of the film and the standard \\"making of\\" and deleted scene features.  Highly recommended for parents and children whose imaginations haven't been blunted by the much less risky visions on display in most Disney and Dreamworks productions.reamworks productions.

B00260HH3K|4.0|I'm no die-hard DB fan, but I have been looking forward to the live-action movie for a LONG TIME. I went in to the film expecting it to be absolutely terrible and thought for sure I would be cringing and groaning at every detail. This was absolutely not true! The characterization of Goku (and Bulma, and Yamcha, and...) could not be more perfect. The comedy was appropriate and I thought the effects were wonderful. I think the story was as well-preserved as could be and they fit in all the key details for people who were totally unfamiliar with the story.<br /><br />The only thing corny about the movie was Uzaru, but... there is no way to make a rampant sasquatch into a respectable piece of cinema.<br /><br />This movie was GOOD. Not the best movie ever, but honorable to the Dragon Ball franchise and good enough to make me look forward to a sequel, should one come along. I am definitely buying it on DVD.
0307454541|2.0|My thoughts; \\"Eh.\\"<br /><br />I don't know, where does one start? I picked this book up after hearing how it was a best seller in Europe. A complex murder mystery that gripped the continent and if not for his unfortunate early demise would bring forth a novelist who would take the publishing world by storm.<br /><br />After reading the five star reviews on Amazon and watching the QuickTime advertisement that provided stats that any author would envy, I sat back with a large cup of cocoa and prepared myself for a literary experience. I was excited.<br /><br />***THERE BE SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />The prologue didn't disappoint. I was immediately hooked. A tired elderly old man, Henrik Vagner, is ravaged by the disappearance of his niece and the gift he has received for his eighty-second birthday, a pressed framed flower. He has been receiving this same gift, mailed from different parts of the world, on the first day of November for the past forty-three years.<br /><br />The book does a great job setting itself up. We go from the prologue to the main character Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist for the muckraker magazine, Millennium. The story opens with Mikael being disgraced in the courts for libel against the Wennerstrom corporation and sentenced to a few months prison. Before he is to go to prison, he is summoned to the Vangner residence where he is hired to perform one last investigation into the disappearance of Henrik's niece, Harriet Vagner.<br /><br />We are also introduced to Lisbeth Salander, a physically and emotionally abused women who is under state controlled child custody at the age of twenty-four. In the Swedish court system, Salander has been uncooperative through her life's traumas and thus perceived as not fit to take care of herself. She finds herself going from one legal guardian to the next. Secretly though, she turns out to be a brilliant computer hacker and quite capable of handling herself.<br /><br />It is after the set-up where the book strays from its strengths. The author attempts to bring to light the suffering and abuse of women in Sweden as well as the courts and law enforcements failure to keep them protected. The introduction of this story element almost feels like an afterthought and is too important of a topic to use for subtext.<br /><br />There is a completely unnecessary rape scene that the author handles abhorrently. I am not one who believes that male author's are unable to accurately portray female characters in their story's, but Stieg Larsson is a shining example of why that perception exist.<br /><br />To have one of the main characters suffer a rape and then handle it with a quick revenge sequence, followed by no real emotional impact to the character in question demonstrates a man's inability to understand just what impact rape has on women. The story didn't need this element and the credibility of the character was completely lost for me.<br /><br />It was at this point where the excitement to read on, was replaced by the urge to close the book. Yet, I continued on.<br /><br />Mikael can't seem to keep his \\"manhood\\" in his pants for very long and we find that he strolls into one sexual relationship after another. Again, there is no consequence for this behavior. Thus, there is no reason for it in the story other than to fulfill the author's sexual fantasies, unless of course it's perfectly normal in Sweden to go around screwing your neighbor, married or not.<br /><br />The author sets up corporate corruption, but really it's never delved into and has absolutely nothing to do with main mystery of the story. As a matter of fact, most plot elements don't intertwine at all. The author has a lot he wants to tell, but he keeps all these elements separate. Again, he takes you out of one story and puts you into another. This left me frustrated as a reader.<br /><br />It is while writing the mystery the Larsson is at his best. I found myself really captured by Mikael's quest to find out what happened to Harriet. It was fun going on the journey of discovery as he tracks down the clues that lead him to the conclusion. Unfortunately Mikael isn't the prime mover of the story and, as in many failed mysteries, the villain has to reveal himself to the protagonist in order to be discovered and taken down, which by the way is a very depraved plot line. Disturbing and odd in its truth, this plot line did not fit into the overall feel of the book. It was as if Hannibal Lecter took over for a couple of chapters. A sexually deviant Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />What is odd, is that the Antagonist (if you want to call him that) is taken down almost one hundred and fifty pages before the end of the novel. I found myself asking, is the mystery over? There is so much book left, what twist is going to come out of this? What curve ball is the author going to give that makes me say, \\"Of course, how didn't I see that coming?\\"<br /><br />But that never happens. Instead the last hundred and fifty pages covers a caper plot that redeems Mikael against the Wennerstrom Corporation. A man we never really see and of whom we know nothing about. I found myself skimming through the last pages uninterested and just waiting for it to end.<br /><br />If you like mysteries there are much better books out there. If you like stories about double cross, go read another.<br /><br />Just skip this one.d him to the conclusion.

B000002O51|5.0|Yes another great release from Boston.  Tom Scholtz is a genius as always and Brad Delp a fantastic and unique vocalist as expected.  Greatness is business as usual for these cats.        What makes this album a standout for me though is the song HollyAnn.  This is one of the greatest songs of all time. I can't listen to this song without getting teary eyed.  The music couldn't be more beautiful and heart stirring.  The lyrics are incredible.  So picturesque and eloquent evoking wonderful imagery.  What I really dig about these lyrics is that there is no detail about the lady in question and no discussion of the relationship.  It is like a picture just a beautiful captivation of a moment at a special time with a lovely lady. Been there.  Done that.  Thank god.  This is the stuff life is made of !!!

During this frantic time, she decides to unwind and go out on a date. She accepts a date from Marcus Peeples, a very gifted minister at Followers of Jesus Faith Worship Center. Even though it was not love at first sight, she did respect him and did have an attraction for him. That is, until she finds out that he is divorced. Being the spiritual woman that she is, she could not date Marcus because of his marital status, even though he was a good man and a great father. Marcus decides that it is time to clear up some confusion about divorce and give Melissa a clearer picture. Just when things start to turn around, Marcus's ex-wife appears back in the picture and wants to claim her ex-husband. Melissa soon figures out that love can sometimes come with a price.<br /><br />In Practicing What You Preach, Vanessa Davis Griggs does a good job of clearing up the misunderstanding that Christians have about divorce. I thoroughly enjoyed how the author blended in the way people in the church deal with baby mama drama. This book was so thought-provoking that once you start to read it, you will not put it down until the very last page. The author gives you the realization of her characters and how they fought with the temptations of the world while trying to stay faithful to God. Practicing What You Preach is a must read.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is a fun, science fiction story with action and some humor, some of it made me laugh out loud (its obvious that the author doesn't take himself too seriously). One reviewer mentioned some aspects of the story were over the top--dude, it's a satire.      As far as the dialogue goes, think \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" meets \\"Starship Troopers\\".  I read this book after reading \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"Spin\\", so it was a nice change of pace. The writing, pace and plotting makes it an easy read; it's perfect if you are traveling or sitting on a beach.
0307454541|4.0|I really enjoyed this book on the whole.  It started very strong out of the gate and I was enjoying it enough to recommend it to others before I was even halfway through.  Atypical characters throughout along with the Swedish setting made it a refreshing change of pace.  Reminded me in some ways of the Javier Falcon series set in Seville.  The pacing of the book definitely changes at times as might be expected in a plot with a long timeline, but my interest was held consistently.  Liked it enough to preorder the next one in the series.
B0000025RI|5.0|What can I possibly say about this album to do it any sort of justice? Nothing, really. Nothing I say here will convey the absolute brilliance that is contained on this album. Michael Jackson was the greatest entertainer of all time, and he still is, even in death. This is when he was at the very pinnacle of his game. Every single track on the album has something special about it. There are very few albums that I can think of where every track is good, but this is one of them. Thriller stands to this very day as the highest selling album of all time. Also, because of music shifting away from media and into digital, this record will never be broken. Michael Jackson left a legacy on the world that will never be forgotten.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Without a doubt I was totally shocked.  The scenes involving Christ being whipped and smacked around were just... too much.  To be completely honest, I thought the amount of violence that poor Jesus had to go through during his final moments was too much to withstand.  The movie is basically one scene involving lots of pain for Jesus right after another, and it gets to the point after a while where it all becomes extremely disturbing.      The wide screen picture quality is perhaps a bit *too* wide (since there's more black above and below the actual picture on screen compared to most movies) and having to read text throughout the movie because none of the characters spoke in english was another small complaint (but I understand the developers were going for absolute realism here, hence the controvery surrounding the film).    Just shocking the way Jesus was treated.
1400049628|5.0|Ok, i picked this up, being that i'm a big fan of anything zombie, wether it's Resident Evil(the games, not movies, they were ok) or Evil Dead, i first saw this in a magazine where the editor said to pick it up, and i'm glad i did. This book tells you everything on how to survive a zombie attack, what weapons to use(unfortunitly, no Chainsaw arm a'la Evil Dead), where to hide, etc. Not only will this book provide usefull tips, but it will also provide a nice laugh, i cannot recall how many times i've laughed at this book, mostly from remembering what they did MUCH differently in games and movies, i still pick up the book from time to time to flip through it, it's a nice buy, so if you have the chance, i would say to grab it.
0312370849|5.0|At first I was not that keen on reading this book since I had read \\"Those Who Save Us\\" but \\"Sarah's Key\\" was such a different book.  I feel ashamed to say that as a Jew, I did not know very much about the Velodrome D'Hiver and I think that if a medium such as beautifully written fiction can inspire one to explore history and delve into unexplored details that have been so underpublicized, it is wonderful.  That is what this book did for me.      I could not put this book down.  It wove a wonderful story together with a chapter in France's history that you can understand present day French wanting to put behind them or or not blatantly promote.  Now, I can't stop googling France's role in WWII and my desire to understand the why's behind the French police's involvement in this. However, like with so much surrounding this war, the why's and wherefore's will never be truly unveiled or understood but my hunger for knowledge and answers will never be satiated.
B001F12J3Y|2.0|While I like the movie and think it is a good reflection of the book and its art, the 3D on this disc is AWFUL.  It was one of the first titles I bought for my new blu ray player and at first I thought that there was something wrong with my eyes, but my wife confirmed that she couldn't stand the 3D either.  I then checked here and saw other threads with the same complaint.  Shame on the manufacturer for this!  I would rate it 1 star, but since the 2D version is great, I gave it 2 stars.  The movie itself deserves 4-5 stars.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|And that quote very neatly sums up the entire movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And it's not the boy Wizard and his friends who carry the film on their shoulders. It's three great British actors who do more with their roles than the script ever manages to suggest: namely--JIM BROADBENT, with his hilarious quizzical expression as Professor Slughorn, ALAN RICKMAN as Snapes, seething with intensity no matter how trite his lines are, and MICHAEL GAMBON as Dumbledore, urging Harry to fight the evil forces engulfing Hogwarts.<br /><br />On a much more superficial level, we have the three young stars giving their usual bland performances as students dealing with raging hormones as well as wizardry--DANIEL RADCLIFFE in his most colorless Potter role to date, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT. They do furnish the only lighter moments in a film dedicated to the dark side, complete with low-key lighting for all the interior shots and murky skies full of Death Eaters and such.<br /><br />Technically, all the usual care has gone into creating the dark fantasy world of J.K. Rowling and the background score by Nicholas Hooper adds dimension to the film's many dark moods and action moments.<br /><br />My impression was that very little seemed to be happening in the way of story development for the first hour-and-a-half with attention drawn more to the love potion moods of the youngsters distracted from their studies by puppy love. RUPERT GRINT, in particular, had some very amusing moments in this vein.<br /><br />But the overall feeling is that this is simply going over ground already covered in previous Potter outings without any really significant new developments or feats of wizardry we expect in these sort of stories. Not having read the book, I can only say that there was a certain lack of focus on story ingredients that made me think I was missing something.<br /><br />Nor was it helpful that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson did not have the clear enunciation of the above-mentioned trio of British gentlemen who really carried the film. Their diction was impeccable compared to the young stars who made their lines indistinct at times.<br /><br />Final verdict: For Potter fans, I'd rate it watchable but not compelling enough to merit such huge box-office grossesreally carried the film.

7119005901|5.0|Romance of the Three Kingdoms is my favorite Chinese literature. This is one of the best classic's in Chinese history. This 4 volume set tells you one of the bloodiest war in ancient China. This is a MUST READ if you are into Chinese classics. From the uprising of Shu, Wei, and Wu and the to the unification of the whole three kingdoms.
006088732X|1.0|I found this book in the possetion of my 12 year old daughter, she had borrowed it from a friend!  I will warn you all, DO NOT LET YOUR DAUGHTERS READ THESE BOOKS!  They are nothing but TRASH, in the first chapter alone, you have girls smoking pot, getting into a bar, getting drunk, and having sex, stealing... and the language is apaling!  Found the F word on numerous pages... These books should not be marketed to children!  DEFINITLY NOT A BOOK FOR KIDS!  I wanted to give it Zero Stars, but they wouldn't let me!
1416562605|4.0|The White Tiger tells the story of how an Indian entrepreneur manages to work his way out of the slums and begin his own business. Humorous and interesting, the novel makes for a good read.<br /><br />Enjoyed:<br />- The narration (minus the framing device, which I'll discuss later) is entertaining and sincere.<br />- Adiga finds a perfect balance between over explaining and under explaining Indian customs, places, etc... The reader is educated without feeling lectured.<br />- The novel is culturally relevant in the sense of out-sourcing and generational strife.<br />- The characters are developed appropriately; you learn about the characters you are interested in and are spared life stories for the ones that aren't essential.<br />- This novel is accessible to various types of readers. You really get what you try to take away; if you read purely for enjoyment you will like the novel. For those of us who desire depth, there is some of that too.<br /><br />But...<br />- The framing device of this story is done poorly. The novel is told over the course of several days through what is supposedly a letter to the Chinese Premier. Without giving too much away, I'll just say that while I understand what he was trying to achieve by comparing/contrasting two \\"up and coming\\" developing nation, I think it wasn't done well from a literary standpoint.<br />- I'm not sure if this necessarily deserved the Man Booker Prize. Don't misunderstand- it is a good novel, but I'm not sure if it was quite that good.<br /><br />While the novel does have a few drawbacks, as a whole I would recommend it.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|Though jazz was the popular music of the US for many decades, there are few post-40s jazz albums - modern jazz albums - that go down easily with non-jazz listeners. There have been pop-jazz crossovers that caught the public's ear and even climbed the charts, but true jazz albums that can keep a pop listener's attention are few and far between. The Dave Brubek Quartet's 1959 release contains two tunes, the opening \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\" and the iconic \\"Take Five,\\" that surprised even the group's own label with their popular acclaim. The album peaked at #2 on the pop chart, and \\"Take Five\\" was a hit single in both the US and UK. Much like Vince Guaraldi's compositions for [[ASIN:B000000XDJ A Charlie Brown Christmas]], listeners took to the melodies and performances without drawing genre lines around them.<br /><br />The quartet's approach wove Brubek's blocky piano chords, Paul Desmond's warm alto saxophone, and the gentle swing of bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello into a most inviting sound. One can't compliment the rhythm section enough, as it's their steady work that keeps one's toe tapping through Brubek and Desmond's melodic explorations, and its their rhythm that guides listeners through this album's unusual time signatures. Morello's introduction to \\"Take Five,\\" followed by Brubek's vamping, have you tapping your foot in 5/4 time even before Desmond insinuates his sax with the theme. It has the rise and fall of a waltz, but when you count it out, the measures go to five instead of three. Amazingly, it feels completely organic. Morello's spare, mid-tune solo provides a brilliant example of drumming dynamics.<br /><br />The album opens with the 9/8 time of \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk,\\" with a 2/2/2/3 pattern that's hard to count even with the numbers in front of you. The music swings in a frantic way that suggests rush hour in New York City until it transitions to a relaxed 4/4 (with 9/8 inserts) for the piano and sax solos. The fluidity with which the band shifts between the two time signatures would be even more breathtaking if it didn't flow so naturally. Other tunes are played in waltz (3/4) and double waltz time, but you won't notice until you count them out loud. Eugene Wright's bass provides the steady pulse around which Brubek and Desmond swing, and the contrast between Brubek's percussive piano and Desmond's smooth sax gives the quartet its signature balance.<br /><br />1959 was a banner year for jazz, seeing the releases of [[ASIN:B000002I4S Giant Steps]], the soundtrack to [[ASIN:B0012GMZMM Anatomy of a Murder]], [[ASIN:B00000I14Z Mingus Ah Um]], [[ASIN:B000002ADT Kind of Blue]] and many other milestones. But Time Out was the only album to break wide of jazz audiences, to seed itself in the broader public's consciousness. And it did so on its own terms, rather than by pandering to the pop sounds of the mainstream. It foreshadowed the lightness and optimism that would mark the transition between the Eisenhower and Kennedy eras, and its tone obviously caught the mood of the times. Ted Maceo's production paints an excellent stereo soundstage, which adds to the recording's excitement.<br /><br />Columbia Legacy's 2-CD/1-DVD reissue augments the album's seven tracks with a CD of live performances from the '61, '63 and '64 Newport festivals that include the album's hits and six additional titles. The basic roles of the players remain from their live-to-tape studio albums, but the concert performances are driven by fresh group interplay and more audacious soloing, and stoked by the audiences' enthusiastic responses. \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" winds up with a forceful piano solo, and the original \\"Koto Song\\" provides a good example of Brubek's interest in world sounds. \\"Take Five\\" is played at a hurried tempo that diminishes the song's swing, but stretched to seven minutes it provides more space for soloing, including a longer spot for drummer Joe Morrello's crackling snare and punchy tom-toms. All eight live tracks arerecorded in stereo.<br /><br />The bonus DVD offers a 2003 interview with Brubek, intercut with historical television and concert footage, and a few then-contemporary sequences of Brubek at his trusty Baldwin. Brubek discusses the album tracks and the dynamics of the band, and shows immense pride in both. An additional bonus provides a 4-angle piano lesson from Brubek as he plays through \\"Kathy's Waltz.\\" The 3-disc package is presented in a quad-fold digipack with a 28-page booklet that includes detailed liner notes by Ted Gioia and fine archival photos. If you don't have a digital copy of the album, this is the one to get; if you already have a much loved copy, this is well worth the upgrade.

0805209999|4.0|I feel a little guilty giving this book four and a half stars (as opposed to five) because it is an exceptional work in many ways and I definitely recommend it. For one thing, the myriad ways this book has been interpreted suggests that it is extremely thought provoking for just about everyone who reads it. I certainly found it very interesting and mildly disturbing (in a good way). I give it a half star ding only because I needed a little more elaboration on the forces at work (both internal and external) against the main character. I understand that such elaboration might have taken away from the book's themes and perhaps even made them less compelling; however, at the end of the book, I still felt a little yearning for something more, like Kafka could've pushed this novel a little further (or perhaps been a little less subtle) without taking away from its overall effect.

0441013597|5.0|Frank Herbert created simply the most brilliant piece of science fiction/fantasy ever written. Arrakis is to me what Middle Earth is to others. If you're debating whether or not you want to purchase a copy,you should stop debating and buy it ASAP. If you're even remotely a science fiction/fantasy fan then you will love it and most likely go on to read the entire amazing series.(Just wait till you get to God Emperor of Dune!It will blow you away!)  Once maybe every generation we're blessed with a writer with an incredible imagination like Tolkien or JK Rowling and Frank Herbert is such a giant. Forget about the awful movie made by that hack David Lynch, do yourself a favor and read this book!
B001PA0FFO|2.0|Any film with P.S. Hoffman and M. Streep deserves a look. Next time I will be a bit more circumspect. This movie features superior acting and wonderful period authenticity. What it lacks, though, is an interesting story. Basically it's about a tormented nun/head mistresses whose creepy mind creates a totally baseless allegation against her immediate superior (Hoffman). Ultimately her warped sense of \\"certainty\\" is riddled with doubt. This is the first time I have seen a movie whose entire story was captured in the title! I found this flick to be trite but oddly viewable due to the great stars who tried valiantly to keep this non-event alive and moving.
0061231401|5.0|If this is your first book by this author, I suggest you buy it and then hold off reading it until you read all of his previous novels in order. (Not just the Sigma series) You'll love the way he tells a story and maybe by the time you finish them all and get to this one, his next book will be out and you won't be mad you have nothing to read. A James Rollins book is like caffeine, you gotta have it or you go through withdrawals.
B00284BMBM|3.0|I didn't even realize this album was came out last week until I saw it in Target over the Weekend.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it and snapped it right up.  After a few listens, I have to say it is definitely not as good as the first, but then again the first album was just so fresh and incredible.  This album does sound different than the first, but really not by much.  Granted there are some unexpected gems, like Open Up Your Eyes and You Don't Belong, and Tennessee Line is a nice change; but musically it really doesn't stray too much of the safety the first album established.  What I dislike the most is that it seems every song is about the same thing, breaking up and trying to move on.  It's an established theme, but I really didn't expect 9-10 songs to essentially be saying the same thing.  There's no denying Daughtry is talented and does have potential staying power, but to me this album just seems like he was almost saying \\"Here are some songs for the fans to keep them happy while we are working on something amazing.\\"  Hopefully that rings true.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|When I first saw the movie I hated it, I thought the plot was very convoluted but the film  does grow on you.      I liked the music even if the interpretations of songs are somewhat literal and even the best cover of a song cannot beat the original The Fab Four.      Highlights include the filmmakers renditions of \\"Come Together,\\" \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kit\\"       Overall-A must see for Beatles fans.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a killer workout. I made it 10 days with level 1 and 3 days with level 2 before having to stop. My knees are killing me; I could barely walk afterwards. I Sweat like a pig and no weight loss or inch loss after 2 weeks. Will probably need a very strict diet to see any results.  Jillian is very pleasant to listen to and very motivational. I believe in her workouts... just not for anyone with knee issues. If you are young, strong, can take constant pounding on the knees, then this workout will do you good. It is a challenge and a very difficult workout. But if you have any issues with high-impact workouts, or workouts that are killer on your knees, then avoid this one.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Was forced to sit through it by my significant other. Asked her at the 1.5 hour mark what the running time was. She said over 2 and a half hours. Oh boy. Felt like I was on a long flight in coach, headed for a really crappy destination.    I will say it works pretty well on its target audience, apparently poorly educated kids with head injuries, since every time Ron fell over or a character said something sarcastic, the theater cracked up laughing. I do not recommend it if you require a plot that makes sense or some mental depth to the script.    Boy oh boy did this one drag on...
0385342020|5.0|\\"Twenties Girl\\" by Sophie Kinsella is a beautiful and funny book about love, family and the most unusual, unique and hilarious ghost.<br /><br />Lara Lington's life is about to get even more complicated and weird (as if it isn't bad enough that her boyfriend Josh just recently broke up with her, that she has financial problems, that the partner in her firm just doesn't want to come back from her holiday and that Lara has to work like crazy to keep the firm from going under) when she starts seeing the ghost of her Great Aunt Sadie. Sadie wants Lara to find a necklace that Sadie always wore and now has disappeared. Of course Lara is shocked to see Sadie in form of her ghost especially because she never really knew her before and only went to her funeral out of family obligation. But still Lara is willing to help Sadie find her necklace and her peace.<br />Soon afterwards Lara realizes that there is more to the missing necklace than she first thought and that to find it she has to uncover some family secrets and learn more about Sadie's life. Lara and Sadie soon become friends and the story takes another turn when through Sadie Lara meets Ed (he's an American businessman currently working in London) and goes out on a date with him so that Sadie can experience one last date through Lara. What starts out at as favour for her aunt's ghost soon develops to a chance of a new relationship for Lara. But to have a future with Ed Lara first has to solve the mystery surrounding the necklace, her relationship with Josh plus her frustrating work situation.<br /><br />Normally I'm not a big fan of stories with ghosts but Sophie Kinsella really made it work for me. Sadie gives the story so much depth and I love the relationship between Lara and her, especially because she wants Lara to be happy and has some very special ways to help her.<br />Lara is the kind of heroine I love. She's a kind person, sometimes not sure about what to do with her life and willing to help Sadie even though her own life is already complicated enough. I also like that the book has a first-person narrator because experiencing the story through Lara's eyes is just wonderful and often very funny.<br />I love how Lara finally realizes that she doesn't need (and want) Josh in her life and that maybe Ed is not really the snobby American she thought him to be.<br />Ed is another great character and the relationship between Lara and him is very lovely but the book is more about Lara and Sadie and not mainly about Lara and Ed. Even though I like books where the relationship between heroine and hero is the main part I love how Sophie Kinsella made Lara and Sadie the two central characters of the book. The scenes between them are just perfect and make the book extra remarkable and great.<br />So all in all I just love \\"Twenties Girl\\" and can recommend it to every romance fan. The book left me with a big smile on my face and a warm feeling in my heart so it's easy for me to say that you should give it a try.<br />Oh, and if you can choose between the British and the US version go with the British one because the cover is just beautiful and perfect for the book.lready complicated enough.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I am an average-level Trekkie.  I'll never buy Vulcan ears or a Starfleet outfit, but I do love the lore created by the Star Trek world.  After watching this once in the theatres and loving it so much, I watched again in the IMAX for the experience.  And then once more in a drive-in, for the drive-in experience.  Each time it was stupendous.<br /><br />As a prequel to the original series (TOS), there is a lot of room to grow.  What we know of the characters is relatively minimal for such revered personalities.  This movie does a brilliant job of filling in the holes.<br /><br />Starting with a catastrophe in the out-reaches of space that ends up resulting in the deaths of a starship, thereby setting up the genesis of James Tiberius Kirk.  In an antique car roaring down a dirt road in Iowa is where we next run into Kirk.  He's about 12 or 13, and already the precocious firebrand is developing into the risk-taking, love-making future leader of men, women, and alien races.  After initial brushes with the law, and a run-in with some Starfleet cadets at a bar, Kirk (Chris Pine) is challenged by Capt. Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and enrolls alongside the brawlers at the bar with hopes of living up to his father's image, and aspirations of command in just a few years.  Within mere minutes of boarding his very first vessel he runs into Bones (Karl Urban) - the absolute best actor in the movie.  (Speaking of the actors, what's great is that they don't try to be their own characters, they imitate TOS actors; and Urban does it impeccably).<br /><br />The action is intense, with celestial skydiving, sword fights, phasers and photon torpedoes, and enough hand-to-hand combat for an avid UFC fan.  The score is magnificent; it thunders during the battles, and accentuates suspense during the drama aspects of the film.  The storyline is classic Star Trek, with the crew coming through in the crunch over and over again, with courageous actions and miraculous results, as they battle Romulans linked to Kirk's birth, and who have a grudge to settle with Spock along with seemingly every member planet of the federation.  And on top of all of that, there is an anonymous, voluptuous, green, female cadet in a bra and panties.<br /><br />The most incredible aspect of this film is the acting.  It's superb all the way around.  Urban, as mentioned, is a brilliant Bones.  Pine is perfect as a young, brash Kirk.  Quinto does a superb job conveying the internal struggles of Spock.  Pegg is hilariously perfect as the genius engineer Scotty.  Cho is a competent shoe-in as Sulu.  Saldana is a great upgrade to the original Uhura in not only beauty but also brains.  Yeltin is also an improvement over the original Chekov, with a clever wit and funny accent, he brings a new life to the character.  And Bana is competent, if not a bit underwhelming, as the lead villain Nero.<br /><br />I loved this movie and give it my highest possible recommendation.  It's quite probably the best movie I've seen in the last few years.  It is perfect for the Star Trek fan, respectful to TOS, and capable of standing on its own for the Trekkie neophytes.  Bravo, JJ Abrams; you've infused new life into the series with this gem, and I anxiously await the next in the series.and who have a grudge to settle with Spock along with seemingly every member planet of the federation.

B000RRX11Q|1.0|The sound quality on the American Beauty original vinyl release and even the Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab's remastered vinyl from 1980 (or there abouts) renders this album un-listenable. The sound is \\"muffled\\" almost as much as the sound in Jeff Beck's \\"Truth\\" or The Dead Kennedys' \\"Frankenchrist\\" albums which are muffled beyond recognition. There are hundreds of reviews on American Beauty about the songs but the muffled sound makes listening to this album so frustrating that the value of the song writing and musicianship is irrelevant.  I am not some wacked out audiophile with a $1500 set of speaker cables. The aforementioned albums have sounded horrible on every system I have owned from 1970 to the present, especially compared to properly recorded albums such as Sargent Pepper's and the Doors first two albums for example.  Maybe the remastered Cd's take care of the garbage sound quality of these albums. I will have to hear the remastered Cd's first before I spend any money on them. It is a shame that potentially significant musical works are reduced to utter uselessness by incompetent recording technique.
B0000047EC|5.0|Superb interplay between Haden's bass and Metheny's guitars (and other instruments).  Put this disc on a high-end stereo system, get a drink, turn the lights off and lose yourself in the sound.    If only this were still available in vinyl...
B000WS4QJG|5.0|For those who love Michael Jackson's music \\"Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller\\" (CD+DVD) will entertain you for years to come. His memorizing voice, intricate dance steps, and  soul-found lyrics not to mention the pure joy of listening will touch your heart beyond imagination. Even if you have recently discovered his music you will soon see and hear why he has millions of fans nation-wide who love him and have remained loyal to him and his music.  He will truly remain in our hearts and his music will continue to delight generations to come -- forever.
B001TKKAJG|3.0|Solid, if a bit uneven, this effort from The Band is one of rock's iconic albums.  For me, I think it's fine, but this is not my favorite Band album and Music from the Big Pink doesn't match the Brown Album.    This MoFi SACD is gorgeously mastered and may be worth buying, even if you're not wild about the music, just because of the sound.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|The movie, Up, is the best movie I have seen this year.  It has something for both adults and kids and everyone in between.<br /><br />When we saw the opening montage, it has to be the best montage I have ever seen.  It tells the story from the beginning to \\"at that point in the movie\\"- which is the end of his first adventure and the beginning of his next adventure.  It deals with the subject of death, loss, and mourning in such a delicate, sympathetic, and empathetic way that it gets you thinking but not sullen or depressed.  This movie is a classic and is right Up there with the other Pixar greats (Toy Story, The Incredibles, etc.).
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The same director as The Cell (although I didn't care for that -- too hard to take); it reminded me a lot of Pan's Labyrinth in that it was essentially a children's story that was unsuitable for children. It also has a touch of J. M. Barrie about it in the sense that the story within is a child's story with a constant undercurrent of sadness.  It features possibly one of the cutest child actors I've ever seen (Catinca Untaru), who's so cute in large part because it's all her -- it's not any of that irritating mugging that too many children in movies seem to mistake for acting these days (I'm looking at you, cast of Harry Potter and Peter Pan!)    It's an incredibly beautiful and enrapturing movie; the storytelling (in the story-within-the-film and the film itself) is absolutely excellent -- moving and immersing to the point of being hypnotic at times.  The illustrations of the story-within-the-film provide a fascinating combination of Roy and Alexandria's imaginations.    Watch it if you like good, complex children's stories, stunning visuals, and movies that are beautiful and beautifully sad.    Warning: if you do watch it, you will inexorably devolve into cliches trying to describe it.  See above.
B002GPNQXU|4.0|In her second Album Demi explores a lot of different music styles. Her rock is still intact, but she has a lot of nice slow pieces like \\"A world of chances.\\" and \\"falling over me.\\" Her voice is very strong and original, and it goes along nicely with all of her songs wither they are upbeat or mellow. She has also co-written quite a few of her songs. It is now one of my favorite albums and it is definitely a must for any of Demi's fans, who I'm sure will not be disappointed.
B00139W3NE|2.0|Truly not worth the big to-do that went on with people boycotting and denouncing it when it hit theaters. It's pretty, but not pretty enough to watch just for that. The movie suddenly ends, without answering any of the many questions it raised. I'm not sure if there are movies planned of the sequels, but it seems that this would have lent itself better to a mini-series format -- but of course, there's not as much money in mini-series as there are in feature films.
1595141715|5.0|Out of all the books that i have read.. this has to be the most interesting and most emotional books i have ever read. It took me back to times of during my high school. Although i didn't have problems as bad as Hannah Baker. The way Hannah used tapes to tell her story after she committed suicide was a lot different then other stories i have read. The way the author placed Clay Jensen in there was just amazing and completely honestly told the story in the perspective the author wanted us to read. It brought me to the place where i could sit there and read or \\"listen\\" to one side of the tape and sit back and think, really think, about what she said and how that connected into my life. It was an amazing read and i'll definitely mention it to others in my community.
0790733226|5.0|I'd only dimly heard of this movie until my husband convinced me to watch it. It's my kind of sci-fi -- very restrained, and very plausible, really. It's the kind of sci fi that doesn't remove you from the real world -- and I mean that in a good way.     The only thing I disliked about the movie was the scene where the two main characters were shoe-horned into the most tired and unenlightening discussion on science and religion ever -- the old \\"We don't need God anymore, we've got science\\" vs. \\"Isn't it nicer to believe that there is a God?\\" arguments. It didn't suit the characters (who seemed too intelligent to be making these arguments), and it didn't add anything to the story.
B000055Y0X|1.0|After years of glowing positives, the movie turned out to be pretty bad when I finally saw it. Itching to eject after a few minutes so as  to get on with something more meaningful in life (like caulking my bathtub), I did sit through it to see what could be salvaged.  The passage of events has aged this movie terribly.    The method of the satire in this movie is to (a) take people who fought the Cold War, (b) put them in a contrived situation, (c) have them state many of their beliefs (from concerns about government mandated fluoridation to nuclear policy) in a bizarrely unrealistic context created by the film-makers so as to make them look foolish.      The beliefs themselves  aren't analyzed. Fictional events are instead arranged to make them look nutty by association.  You are quickly taught who to laugh at on cue, like conditioning Pavlov's dogs. If someone has idea X, you know you are supposed to laugh at them and that's approved.    It is the approach of lazy pseudo-intellectuals everywhere.  This movie shows the tedious shape of modern liberal thought, bigotry, and prejudice in the process of forming, before it ravaged the country in the late 60's down to the present, degrading hundreds of millions of lives along the way.  Same thing with Sarah Palin and Saturday Night Live; instilling conditioned reflex responses so people don't have to think.    Since history and Soviet archives have shown the Cold War architects to have been correct in their assessment of just about everything (i.e., McCarthy was right), the mocking in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" just looks foolish.    It's the sort of movie people who want to appear sophisticated go to and say they liked to get in with the \\"enlightened elite\\" for having \\"correct\\" thinking.     Dr. Strangelove himself is a minor character, having ~5 minutes of material out of 1.5 hours.  Apparently the joke with him is that he can't control his arm, which keeps wanting to \\"Heil Hitler\\" salute, etc., as he discusses plans with generals and President.  I don't know why that's funny or interesting.  It's boring and stupid. Sort of like Monty Python -- if you think MP is clever and deep like most 12 year olds, you'll like Dr. Strangelove.    Many interesting and thoughtful things could have been done about the Cold War, the effort to halt an ideology bent on enslaving the world to the will of an elite that thought itself better and more enlightened than everyone, but was really just a systematically defective understanding of reality.     Dr. Strangelove is an echo of this elite and their defective understanding of reality trying to lull asleep the masses they despise, by trying to  mock and ridicule people who correctly acted against them to all of our benefit.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I bought this cd because it had alot of his music I didn't have.  After his death I went and found my Micheal Jackson cds.  Unfortunately my Jackson 5 cd was in bad shape and skipped alot.  But my original Off The Wall and Thriller play just fine even though they have many scratches.  Bottom line is this I have had to return this new cd four times at a store because it skips. I am thinking perhaps my car doesn't like MJ...or cds these days aren't made well.  I am going to try one more time through Amazon.
0425188809|3.0|Reading Watchers was like riding a rocket into space.  The initial excelleration and high speed toward the unknown must be such a rush, but once you are floating in an expanse of far-out existance, there is only disappointment.  Maybe that is a bad analogy, but Watchers had taken me in for the first 300 pages.  I kept thinking this was one of the better novels I read in a while.  Einstein's character, however, becomes hokey and too caricatureishly unbelieveable toward the end.  The villans are erased too abrubtly, and plot devices are predicatble and dead-ended (i.e. Stark, overdone foreshadowing with Vince).  The novel is an interesting read that did keep me captivated, but something about the plot and its chracters just falls short and seems cheap at times.  There is a nice homage to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but it does not seem to work here.  Watchers has the potential for more depth but refuses to go there.  After reading several of Koontz's novels, I am steering away to more in-depth, problematic examples of the genre.
0385340575|4.0|Another well-written mystery thriller by Lee Child.  Like most of his books the gore factor is a bit too high for my tastes and the details about guns gets a bit tiring... but the story and characters are interesting.  Put in talented big-screen hands, this will probably make a good movie someday.
0141439807|3.0|Three sisters got married.  The first married a baronet, the second a clergyman, and the third one married a penniless soldier.  Which one of the three is banished from the family?  A no-brainer here.  But in a misguided effort to help out Mrs. Price, Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris agree to care for Fanny, the only daughter from seven children.  Fanny Price is shy and awkward with a weak disposition.  She misses her family horribly, especially her brother William.  Mansfield Park, her new home, is a cold place where she is treated like nothing more than a charity case.  Edmund Bertram is the only exception.  He has treated Fanny with kindness since her arrival, and he reminds her a great deal of William.  But as Fancy gets older, and her two female cousins begin to court, she develops other feelings for Edmund.  And now that the Crawfords have come to visit, and Edmund develops a crush on Mary Crawford, it seems that Fanny will no longer be a priority in his life.  She is lonelier than ever.  Maybe, just maybe, the charming Henry Crawford will be able to make things better...<br /><br />Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors.  Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility are on the top of my \\"to be read every couple of years\\" list.  Mansfield Park, however, has never sparked my interest and attention quite the same way as the aforementioned three.  I thought I'd feel differently about it now, but I still think Fanny Price is dull, Edmund is fickle, Mary the liveliest character in the book (no wonder Edmund likes her) and Henry a little too suspiciously charming.  Even though the novel opens with a rather hilarious first chapter (Austen had a wonderful way with irony), the story sort of goes downhill from there, going from boring to worse.  The book is not terrible, but it's not Austen's best effort either -- at least not by my measure.  But don't let me stop Mansfield Park fans from loving it, or from those of you who haven't read it from trying it.  Anything written by Austen is definitely worth reading.nything written by Austen is definitely worth reading.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Because this movie was not the Half Blood Prince by any stretch of the imagination. I have read repeated reviews giving this film 5 stars or A+ ratings and it's ridiculous. 2 stars, even 3, or a C rating I could possibly stomach, but this movie totally butchered the story. They should have just changed the title altogether and not messed up a good thing.     I think that some people feel that the book fans do not like the film because it's not exactly like the original story.  Not liking this film has nothing to do with fans of the story wanting an exact replica on the screen. Would that have been awesome?  Yes, but not expected. I have never expected the movie's to cover every detail of the books, but the important scenes should be included.  That being said, adding in unnecessary scenes that were not in the book is a waste of time. It detracted time from the end battle and the funeral that should have taken place because they are extremely significant to the story. Too much romance and not enough of the noteworthy, serious, or dark points were covered.    I did enjoy the performance of a number of the actors but I can imagine the non-book readers could have left feeling very confused by the lack of information given in this film. I think the reason these movies do so well in the theaters is the fans of the books know the story is over and the movies are nostalgic for them, despite how badly they are often handled. It is a shame that almost all the heart we grew to love from the books was lost in the film.     I could not recommend this movie to a book fan or a newcomer who hasn't read the books, neither one would be satisfied. If you only want to focus on special effects and romance then I am sure you will like the film much better than I did.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I never thought it was possible for Daughtry to top what is one of the best CD's of all time, but somehow they've managed to do it. Leave This Town is a real band effort, and shows how much they've grown as musicians and songwriters over the last three years. Chris's voice sounds better than ever, and he puts so much emotion into each song. To the person that said that Chris can't sing, let's just say that your past history says it all..  Leave This Town has something to satisfy everyone...from the hardest rock song Daughtry have recorded(You Don't Belong), to one of the most beautiful rock ballads ever written (September). It doesn't take many listens of LTT to know that any of the songs on the CD could end up as #1 hits. Daughtry have once again exceeded all expectations and shown us why they are the Hottest Band in the Country.
0060558121|4.0|If you're a fan of Gaiman's other works, [[ASIN:0060558121 American Gods: A Novel]] will not disappoint. The book centers around the pantheons of history and what becomes of gods when people stop believing in them. It's told through the vantage of Shadow, an apathetic felon serving as the story's reluctant protagonist. The novel moves along at a quick pace, as the reader discovers why America is not a good place for gods.<br /><br />The one caution I'll give, for those who like to have all the answers spelled out, is that Gaiman does not belabor the back-story of each god, actually using the expected ignorance of the reader (and Shadow) as a plot device. This may frustrate some, but Gaiman does an excellent job of giving you enough information to understand the story he's written.<br /><br />Overall, it was an excellent, highly enjoyable read.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|Being a HUGE Sookie Stackhouse fan, and not having HBO, I waiting excitedly for the first series to come out on DVD.  Though I enjoyed the series, I enjoyed the books much more.  Unlike some series where the viewer gets more out of it if they read the books, this one can stand alone and in my opinion, takes a lot more liberty with the character story lines than I prefer.  Still, a great series, good effects and story plots.      Not of die-hard lovers of the Charlaine Harris books.
1439157383|1.0|This is my first of her books, also my last. Way too much sorrow just added for the fun of it. The ending was terrible.

B0018CWEYY|2.0|I loved this show for the first three seasons, but enough is enough. I agree with the person who says that the writers just make stuff up without taking anything from previous episodes into account. In seasons 1 through 3, the confusing plot was alleviated by the flashbacks; they gave you nice breaks where you could relax and get to know the characters better. Now, they have been replaced by \\"flash-forwards\\". So now we have to keep track of what's going on on the island, PLUS the stuff in the future, which involves a mysterious conspiracy of some kind (maybe, it's all very vague). Basically, this show has gotten too clever for its own good. They keep packing in more mysteries, more plot twists, and more characters (who in turn have more mysteries and plot twists in their personal stories). It's a shame, because I have always felt that the dialogue and acting on this show was very good. If I got the satisfaction of a loose end tied up even once in a while, I would probably keep watching, but they never explain ANYTHING. What I find most hilarious of all is that at the end of every season, the writers give interviews saying things like \\"Oh, the last season was very confusing, but just wait. Next year a lot of things will become clear.\\" This always turns out to be bull. I'm sick of being strung along!
0307383415|5.0|Whatever one thinks of our President (and I am a supporter), it is hard to deny that he is a thoughtful American who feels deep compassion for the underprivileged and deep love for his country. This book was written long before Barack Obama thought of running for President and it expresses his hopes, dreams, and yes, his doubts. Very few of our Presidents could have written a book such as this. The office is a difficult one to fulfill well, and the times are testing; but this book gives me considerable hope.
630463949X|5.0|This is the best DVD product ever made by Fleetwood Mac. Look no more: this is it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a great vampire movie but not in the usual sense.  There are no \\"hollywood\\" vampires but rather, a swedish one.  This film is a story of a lonely boy who finds companionship with an odd neighbor who is a girl around the same age.<br /><br />The movie centers around relationships.  The relationship between the two children, the relationship between the girl and her guardian, male/female relationships, and relationships between school children (or pack mentality).<br /><br />We know that there is something wrong with the relationship between the young girl and her guardian.  The older man blindly follows the girls demands and yet there is a loving bond (not in a creepy way).  As we watch the film, we discover the truth of things and the new relationship between the boy and girl explains all.  SPOILER: We discover that the guardian was once in the same spot as the boy.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend it to others who enjoy great filmmaking.  It provoked all kinds of conversation about the meaning of love, vampires (aka narcissists) and growing up.  Just know that it is not a fast paced, action packed vampire movie although there is plenty of gore involved.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I loved season 2 and the layers to the story. What I really love about MadMen DVDs is the bounty of commentaries. OMG, some eps have 2! Matthew and company really go all out for the fan. I'm really impressed that they put so much oomph into each season. Thx!
B000I2J6K0|2.0|What kind of DVD is this. it is way to rigorous for our pregnant bodies! Being pregnant is about staying healthy for you and your growing baby, not focusing on your weight and pant size. Those should be the last thing on your mind. As far a weight goes, try to stay with the guidelines of a weight gain of 25-35 pounds, and don't freak out if you a gain a little more! i feel that most of us, me included, chose to do these work out to keep up with the unrealistic standards of the media. It seems that a ton of these mom gaina massive amount of weight and then magically drop down to their old sizes with in months.  Look at Kate Hudson. It is reported that she gained way more than the recommended weight and she lost it all with three hour per day workout sessions. Starlets have trainers, nutritionists, and full time nannies to help them get red carpet ready. If you want some positive role models, look at Jennifer Garner and Jenny McCarthy. It took them over a year to loose the weight because they did it the healthy way. They were realistic and took their time. McCarthy credits weight Watchers as her key to success. This program helped me greatly with my post pregnancy weight loss. My complaints for this system... its too strenuous for our growing bodies, I hated the parts in which her Desperate Housewife star husband engages in the work out are a bit sexual, I felt I was watching a pregnancy guide to sex, and I thought it was hilarious when she was doing push ups, real push ups...are push ups going to get me ready for child birth? No!
B000063COX|5.0|If not the greatest debut in the history of heavy rock, then easily in the top ten, `Iron Maiden' heralded a changing of the guard and the dawn of a new era. It is probably the best record from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal as well and a timeless classic that never gets tired. Some of the most well know songs in heavy metal can found on this gleaming alloy of evil including \\"Running Free\\" which was a top ten hit in the UK in the early spring of 1980. \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" proved to be an early example of the type of virtuosic epics that would become the trademark of band founder and chief songwriter Steve `arry' Harris. The time changes, harmonies and variations in the melody, were such a decisive blow to music critics who criticized the musicianship of metal players. The origins of the early Iron Maiden sound due owe a significant debt of gratitude to Paul Di'Anno, whose gruff, punk rockfish vocal style slides in perfectly with these razor blade tales of the East End of London's seedy and dangerous streets. Bruce Dickinson will always be Maiden's greatest singer but Di'Anno's importance cannot be overlooked. He just sounded angry and the songs on the debut drip with violence and rage, \\"Prowler\\", \\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" (originally a single release after the album, later added to US release and all subsequent re-releases).  \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" was a powerful example of what Maiden could do with a slower song and \\"Transylvania\\" was a rip snorting instrumental that began another great Maiden tradition. Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton proved to be a very capable guitar tandem though this was Stratton's only Maiden recording; he would soon be replaced by longtime Murray foil Adrian Smith. Clive Burr handled the skins and met the challenge of keeping up with Harris' time changes and murderous melodies. If I have played this record a thousand times I would not be surprised and it could very well be my favorite from Iron Maiden which shows you how important I think it is in terms of its impact on my future listening habits. Haunt me taunt me torture me back at your lair...
1416955070|2.0|This book had so much potential and the concept could have been taken to great levels. Very disappointing.
1591391105|3.0|I think the concept of \\"The First 90 Days\\" is a great one. This book covers so many different issues and potential hurdles that you have to respect the time and research that went into this.    On the other hand, the tone of voice the author uses is so painfully dry and boring that you can't help but picture this book as being red by Ben Stein in [[ASIN:B001S86J1C Ferris Bueller's Day Off (Bueller... Bueller... Edition) [Blu-ray]]]    I really liked how Mr. Watkins devoted an entire chapter to building your team and explaining that it's okay to let even long time people go if they're not fitting into your gameplan or working well with others. I also like how he stressed through the entire book to be humble yet open and honest about your accomplishments. It's just too bad I haven't been this bored by an author's tone in years. I can usually finish a 250 page book in a few days - this took me nearly a month because it was so boring in tone and voice.
0307473465|4.0|The question has been asked over and over about Nazi Germany.  The evil of the Nazi leaders is plain enough.  But what of the average, everday person?  What if you were one of them? What would you have done?  It is very difficult to know, such insight being particularly difficult and particularly rare.    THE READER explores this question but from a different and interesting angle.  Instead of focusing on Nazi Germany during the time of its existence, it removes the question by a generation.  It must have been very strange to be young in Germany during the '50s and '60s.  Many people not that much older than you, what exactly were they doing just a few years ago?     Michael Berg, the main character here, has the type of affair at the age of 15 that every 15 year old boy dreams of.  Hanna is older but still has her looks, sexy, mysterious, and is willing to teach him a few things.  Then . . . she disappears.  Just like that.     Hanna resurfaces several years later at a trial for war crimes.  Michael, a law student, attends the trial, not knowing on his first day that Hanna is one of, indeed the main, defendant.  Hanna's effect on Michael left its mark after the years, with Michael reserved  and distant towards others, his mind always on the girl that vanished.    Hanna's trial does not go well and Michael realizes that Hanna, embarassed by a well kept secret, is not doing all that she can to defend herself.  More deeply, the trial explores numerous issues, both historical and emotional.  How is one to judge Hanna for the crimes she committed?  That is not to say she does not bear some guilt.  Clearly she does.  But what is the standard?  Should our inability to project ourselves with complete accuracy into a similar situation act as a mitigating factor?      One characteristic of THE READER is both its strength and its weakness.  Neither Michael nor Hanna is sketched out that well.  As a weakness, it prevents readers from connecting with the characters as well as they might.  As a strength, it allows one to view both Michael and Hanna as representatives for their respective generations.  These are not merely individuals here.  They are symbols of Germany's Nazi past as well as its post-war struggle to come to terms with its own actions.  Well written yet a quick read, if one is thinking of reading this because one liked the movie, then by all means, read it.
0292701934|4.0|I'm just beginning to really learn more about Avedon; one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century. This book, written by Laura Wilson, a fellow photographer who travelled with Avedon around the west for one of his seminal works, offers a small peek into the mind of Avedon.<br /><br />I must warn you that the insights deal with how Avedon approaches people - there is no technique, no discussion of lighting, nothing technical at all. For me, this is exactly what I wanted from the book. However, if you expecting any of these, you'll want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />What this book does offer is a wonderful overview of the thoughts behind \\"In the American West\\". You begin to feel how Avedon approaches his subjects and how he connects to them. It also gives a feel for the final product came about from both an organic and a very well planned, envisioned if you will, composition.
B0025X4P24|5.0|Vanessa is back and sounding better than ever. This is the most versatile CD I have heard in a long time. Every song is a masterpiece. It is definitely \\"Grammy\\" worthy! I am glad I made this purchase. She is one classy lady!
0307266303|5.0|A fantastic book in every way.  First, it is very informative.  It describes the possible scenarios that could have led to the evolution of humans as the all-around best endurance runners in the animal kingdom (our ancestors literally ran their prey to death).  It also explains how modern civilization has created a culture of humans who have strayed drastically from its running roots even while millions of humans have re-discovered the joy that is inherent in doing what we are designed to do.  The book also describes the problems that modern shoe companies have introduced by continuously trying to \\"improve\\" their products while the bare foot itself is a near perfect running implement in and of itself.<br /><br />Born to Run is also very thought-provoking.  The story of the native Tarahumara people and their superior athletes living their traditional culture in the depths of the nearly inaccessible Copper Canyon of Mexico will cause you to ponder your own culture and your own hidden abilities.<br /><br />An amazing group of characters are brought to life in this book.  Caballo Blanco is a reclusive running fanatic who escaped modern civilization to make his home with the Tarahumara.  Barefoot Ted is a talkative and eccentric runner who manages to run 50 miles over rough trail barefoot.  He also nonchalantly drinks his own urine when water is scarce.  Other characters include a host of elite endurance runners, evolutionary biologists, running specialists, and the author himself, who relates and relays the information and stories from all these people in a way that doesn't push or promote any specific running philosophy, but causes the reader to get excited about experimenting with some of their ideas.<br /><br />Finally, Born to Run is so well written that it becomes one of the few non-fiction books that I would classify as a real page turner.  I enjoyed this book from start to finish and am sure that it has altered, in a positive way, the way I think about running and the way I train.
B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|Apparently, on agreeing to sell the Harry Potter film franchise, one of J K Rowling's conditions was that the cast had to be predominantly British. This request proved to have been one of the fundamental keys to the success of the movie version of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. At the risk of being contentious, fine as his work on the film is, I think the choice of Chris Columbus as director ensures a well made, slick product but also just that bit of blandness that prevents the film from being an absolute classic. Having said that, the casting is phenomenal, especially Radcliff and Watson, and the choice of remaining true to the novel rather than condensing and combining Rowling's work is at once inspired and obvious. Compared to the 'Lord of the Rings' saga released at the same time, it's a little bit too shiny, a bit too mainstream in it's style, but it's certainly a success because it gets all of the big things right, principally the characters. One wonders if Terry Gilliam (Rowling's first choice for director) had helmed the film, it might have been more unique, but could easily have become a mess too. Ultimately, the reason this film is so superb is because of Rowling's imagination and her good judgment in balancing plot with unforgettable characters.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I read this book in a few days and loved it .  The characters reminded me of Titantic.  I definitely would recommend reading this.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|There was so much hype about this film that it would be a pity not to watch it. Unfortunately, there was much hype to it.<br /><br />Not a fan of the comic books, nor of DC Comics particularly, I came to this movie with eyes, ears and mind open. Suspenseful, dark and intriguing were all appropriate adjectives as the film got under way and it certainly required attention to keep track of the plot.<br /><br />Like a rose which unfolds with exposure to the light and heat, the plot became more fleshed out and the pieces began to knit together with great promise but then at some point it began to lose it's way.<br /><br />Whether the writers got too carried away with their own complications or whether someone figured that the machinations required some diversion to spice things up I do not know but the film sort of lost it's way and the homily of man as a savage beast faltered.<br /><br />I tried to picture that the relationship which engulfed the two heroes was to establish their humanity as opposed to the continuous portrayal of the watchmen as the bearers of revenge or retribution or justice but then that really did not work as they were of less important than the omnipotent figure who had retreated from humanity to the empitiness of Mars. Neither did it make sense as a lustful coupling, it just did not seem to form a useful conjunction in the scope of the film as a whole.<br /><br />As always with the DC mould, there was the explanation, dilema and resolution in the name of good at the end along with the juxtaposition of the savagery and destruction which took place. But by that time there was an element of the unfinished about the film, an aftertaste which was brought on by the films loss of direction shortly after the midpoint.<br /><br />Entertaining and thought provoking to a certain extent, this film could, and should have, been a lot more than how it was presented on the big screen.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|We saw this movie its second week in the theaters. It was a family outting that included me, my wife, two daughters and grandma (my mom). My thoughts going into this movie were, \\"Hey, we put up with the TV show on a daily basis and it is cute enough so just sit back and let the girls have their fun.\\" My shock is that this movie turned out to be fun for all. DADs, DON'T LET YOUR MANLY, MACHO EGO GET THE BEST OF YOU ON THIS ONE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE FULL OF SOLID ENTERTAINMENT AND THE KIND OF VALUES WE CAN ONLY HOPE OUR DAUGHTERS WILL EMBRACE! There were three major values messages I was thrilled to see:<br />- Importance of love, honor and respect among family members.<br />- Value of lasting friendships.<br />- The need to keep one foot firmly planted on the ground no matter how high your life takes you.<br /><br />Huge kudos to the cast, director, producer, and Disney Studios for making such a wonderful, entertaining, heartfelt and classy film.
B001UJSW7S|5.0|Korngold's opera needs no raves from me---it's wonderful.  This is the same recording at the older 2 disc set on RCA.  I bought it in hopes that the mastering would tame the somewhat spiky sound---making Kollo's voice sound especially grating.  I could be fooling myself, but it does seem a bit smoother.  Maybe wishful thinking.  I really do prefer the slim case, but if you need a libretto and liner notes, go for the older version.  Seems to be about the same price either way.

B002C2XXJY|3.0|Demi Levato may have a good voice--but she writes monotonous songs that all sound the same.  This album is basically her singing the same type of power ballad over and over.  About half of these use her trick of starting really soft and quiet, then getting really loud with a rock guitar, then gettingn soft and loud again.  Most are about her breaking up with a boy.    The best song is one she co-wrote with John Mayer (who plays guitar on it) entitled World of Chances.  Two other good songs are the \\"bonus tracks\\"  Gift of a Friend and So Far So Great (which lack enclosed lyrics, unlike the rest). it appears the less she had to do with the writing of the song, the better it turns out.    Her song with Nick Jonas (Stop the World) is interesting due to its mature lyric but it doesn't sound much different from the rest of the tunes. The rest all were co-written by her and the one song she wrote by herself (Catch Me) is so dull that it should not have been included on the album.    The album photos are over-the-top.  This is a teenage girl trying to look and sound much older than she is.  She needs a different producer who will help her select songs that are appropriate for her age and her pre-teen Disney audience.  Those in love with her will probably give it five stars because no matter what she put on the CD they would love it--but the rest of us will see this as just another attempt by a tween star to make herself sound older than she is to try to reach a bigger audience.
B0000E69K8|4.0|This is a must-have for AK fanatics.  Her soulful voice just resonates in this fine vinyl recording.  Highly recommended.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Some of us are old enough to have the original LP or cassette recordings. Regardless, buying the CD version with the bonus tracks is totally worthwhile. I would recommend it to any MJ fan or beginner. I evidently enjoyed the insanely groovy music but also the demos which highlight Michael's endless talent. The interviews providing a little history on how the songs were compiled are also a definite plus. Loved it!!!!!
B000UNYJV8|5.0|A must see movie.  Hard to find in U.S.  Best Buy does't even have the movie in its internet database.  Thank you Amazon for having this great movie available.  I ordered this movie, and it was at my front door in barely 24 hours!  Amazing movie and amazing delivery speed!
B001HN69AE|1.0|I already knew this was going to be a bad movie so I watched it online and I still want to erase my memory for seeing it like that. Watching grass grow had more entertainment then this movie. Most of the key characters are missing liek the red ribbon army and where is Krillin? Why is Goku learning how to be a airbender and not a fighter? When did they let the green goblin play piccalo? Overall worst movie ever if you watch it you will want to burn your eyes out.
031606792X|1.0|The Twilight series was never exactly great literature, but this...this beats the worst of the first three books easily. This is quite possibly one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. It's a master class in entertaining crap.  Pros:  *Jacob is at least somewhat sympathetic in this book, and gets a little character development in his struggle to take control of the pack. It wasn't nearly as good as it could have been in a more capable author's hands, but it was decent. There's also little character development for Rosalie, and some interesting descriptions of how a vampire perceives the world and...ah, who am I kidding?  Cons:  *The story of this book is really just insane. It starts with the whole ridiculous wedding, and then Meyer rips her own canon to shreds and allows Edward and Bella to have a child. (Renesmee Carlie Cullen? What kind of name is THAT, anyway?)  *Characters get everything they want at almost no price, everything wraps up conveniently with the deus ex machina of Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee. (Okay, I have to say it: Jacob imprinted on a freaking infant. What the hell, Jacob? You some kind of pedowolf?) Happily ever after with no problems, everything's turned out fine with minimal conflict, any chance of a climax averted before anyone gets so much as a bruise, etcetera.  *The characters are even worse than they were in previous books, and not even consistent anymore. Bella is more pitiful than ever. Edward becomes a complete a*$hole. Renee has conveniently shifted personalities and fully accepts Bella's decision to marry Edward, with no explanation for her abrupt change of character. Everyone's Mary-Sue traits shoot through the roof. Etcetera.  *The ending is just...so bad. It's just about the worst that an ending can get, a sin against all of fiction. Everything leads up to a climactic battle and then...Alice shows up with another deus ex machina and everything is resolved with no one getting hurt. Apparently Bella's power as a vampire is strong enough to hold off an army of the most powerful vampires in the world, and without those powers the Volturi are helpless weaklings. The book ends on a dud because the author was too cowardly to actually have a battle and let any of her characters actually die.  I think that's pretty much all I need to say about Breaking Dawn. However, like all the other books, reading it was great fun, maybe even because of how amazingly it failed at every single level. This book is so bad...it's awesome.
0316066524|1.0|I've read non-conventional fiction for years.  This is the first time that I have felt that the author was giving me the finger and snickering because I was naive enough to think that Infinite Jest was a serious literary effort    Jim Icard
B000HT3P7E|4.0|Good show, very funny. Sort of like Friends (gang of single NYer's) meets Scrubs (innovative comedy). The only disappointment is that the entire first season revolves around the whole \\"will-they-or-won't-they-get-together\\" plotline. Except you know from the very first episode of the series that they don't end up together (when the kids in the future refer to \\"Aunt Robin\\"). Still, I really do enjoy the show.
B0002XDODU|4.0|i own every single Rammstein album including the singles and live performances such as Volkerball and Live Aus Berlin (live from Berlin)  and i have to say with the exception of the CD RosenRot (Rose Red) i have to say this is the softest album Rammstein has ever delivered. with songs like Amour (Armor) which has got to be their worst song. but other than that with songs like Reise Reise (Arise Arise, popular to contrary belief the way Rammstein uses the word \\"Reise\\" does not mean to \\"travel\\" the verb \\"Reisen in the sailor language means to arise in the morning. but it seems to have died out in the newer German language) any way the album is full of things like that another example and the second best song on the album, but takes the cake for strange and disturbing is Mein Teil (my part)the song is about a man who posted a request online for a willing victim. the man signed it \\"Der Metzger Meister\\" the master butcher. well to make a long story short the \\"Metzger Meister\\" found a willing victim and he ate him. the reason this album does not get five stars is because its not hard core Rammstein, only three or four songs sound like vintage Rammstein, the lyrical style is the same, but they are to soft. but overall a good album.
B000TGJ8A8|2.0|Yet another bad movie from Nicholas Cage. And Julianne Moore sucked too. Only redeeming part of the movie was Jessica Biel, who is a babe and did a pretty good job playing the requisite damsel-in-distress.
B001VPJYZK|1.0|The fifth season of Desperate Housewives was the worst one yet (possibly the worst show of the 2008-09 season). Here is a list of why it was terrible:    1)The 5 year jump---the writers went nowhere with this (except the fact     that M.J. is five)    2)The \\"mystery\\"---not a mystery! who didn't figure it out in the 2nd or      3rd episode?    3)Repetitive story lines---Parker sleeping with an older woman sounds a     lot like John and Gaby. Susan and Mike getting divorced and falling      back in love sounds a lot like Carlos and Gaby. Many other character      plots seem to have been seen by other characters as well.    4)The doctor---months after Dave killed his doctor, his secretary is     still calling him...how stupid is she? It isn't rocket science to    figure out someone's dead-she didn't even worry! This didn't make the     season bad, it was just stupid and got annoying.    5)The 100th episode---the first few episodes were supposedly supposed to     to prepare us for the 100th episode...which was nothing! it did not     make one impact on the show. We had never even heard of Eli.     6)The finale---Desperate Housewives always ends in a great cliffhanger     leaving us to feel suspense all summer. I haven't thought once about    this one. Who did Mike marry? Great cliffhanger...not!    That is why this season was terrible.    The DVD set, however, gets a star. It is (probably) in a great package like all Desperate Housewives sets. Also, it is loaded with more bonus features than usual (possibly for sale purposes due to how weak the season was).     In conclusion, season 5 had a moment or two (i can't think of one...maybe it didn't have moments) and the star i give is for this DVD set, not the season itself.
B0000AM6JI|3.0|I never had gotten around to seeing this previously. In the end, I don't think I missed much. Pacino reprises his gangster role from Scarface and the Godfather movies; maybe not quite as over-the-top as Scarface, but a similar enough kind of story. Sean Penn plays his sleezebag friend, and I guess he did a good job, because I hated the guy!
0786838655|5.0|Even though I am much older from the reading level ages, I was looking for a genuine fantasy action and adventure story which I found this book in my middle/high school library. I couldn't believe how good was the book and more surprising, how much I gobbled it up. I haven't read like that since Matilda...in elementary school after watching the movie. It was such a joyride and was a very fun read.     I absolutely loved it and if I ever do get the time for the four other books, I will read it. Unfortunately my reading list is very long.     I wish I wrote something as captivating.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|I remember when this came out, I thought it was only mediocre, and was surprised when it won Best Picture. Watched it again for the first time since it's original release, and was still disappointed with it.
B000001FI7|1.0|I wasted my money on this one for sure.<br />Same voice on every track gets a bit much.<br />I have no idea why this was recommended to me..I prefer Cafe del Mar and Budda Bar and also Hotel Costes, so how did this get onto my list? YUCK
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Completely deserving of it's rating on IMDB, this was the best documentary I think I've ever seen on nature. There were a couple that were a little slow for me; the Plains and the Forests weren't as interesting as the Deep Sea and Poles were, but all were worth watching. Some of the shots are incredibly memorable even months later - the great white whale jumping out of the sea, the pod of whales creating a circular bubble, the snow leopard hunting, the pack of tigers taking down an elephant, the hibernating polar bears waking up in the spring, the amazing Bird of Paradise, and many many more. This series alone is a reason to go buy an Blu Ray player!!!
0345479092|4.0|Having read the book before giving birth to our first child, I found many parts of this book to be very helpful.  I will say, the more you read, the more you realize you do not need to follow anyone's advice to a \\"t\\".  Take what works for you, forget the rest.  I don't understand the criticism that Hogg says no demand feeding--I interpreted her to be saying that parents quite often go for food to soothe a baby when that is not really what baby wants or needs, not that you should put over feedings if your baby wants them.  Correspondingly, new parents out there will find that whenever your baby cries, people around you will say \\"oh he's hungry\\" and even if you know it cannot possibly be true because he just ate 10 minutes ago, and ate well, you might second-guess your ability to interpret what your baby needs.  I found Hogg's book helpful in this regard.  Following the EASY routine definitely helped me learn how to read my baby's cries, and now (at three months) I know what she's telling me when she cries or fusses, and in fact, it did not take long at all to be able to get into a routine where her cries were easy to read.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This was a great season,a stunning surprise given the fact that Miles/Gough, the original producers had left. Most thought the show would go down the tubes, but it did not.  In fact, it only got better.    The season had a film noir look to it, and much darker plot lines.  The Doomsday arc is the best, the Lana arc is the the worst--but we had to deal with her somehow.      Outstanding is the acting of Sam Witwer who plays Davis/Doomsday.  He gave a fresh take on innocence turning evil.  The Lois/Clark relationship definitely improved.  Tom Welling has anchored this series superbly since its beginning.  He deserves far more credit then he gets for keeping Smallville a solid dramatic slhow.    Most folks, me included, would welcome a complete metamorphosis of Clark into Superman, but the writers gave us much more this season than I thought.  Some iconic images are introduced and the finale is rather shocking--and satisfying.    No one thought the show would go on this long.  To its credit, Smallville remains an excellent show.  If you have not seen this season, this is a must view; if you have, buy the DVD and enjoy it all a second time around.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|I had been turned onto Dream Theater years ago by a friend.  I didn't care for them.  They seemed to hard rock sounding and not progressive.  I grew up considering Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Yes, King Crimson and other bands to be progressive rock.  I decided to buy this album because I heard some songs from L.T.E., and being a Tony Levin fan I decided to check out Dream Theater.  I like it the more that I listen to it.  I get used to the ka-chunk sound on some of the songs.  Maybe I will check out some of the other albums.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|As a progressive rock fan, my experience with heavy metal over the past 30 years or so has been restricted to a few albums by Rush.  As such, it was not until recently that I started exploring progressive heavy metal outfit Dream Theater and have been generally impressed with what I heard.  Overall, while I did not enjoy Black Clouds & Silver Linings (2009) as much as some of the other DT albums I own, this new release is still a lot of fun to listen to.<br /><br />The lineup includes John Petrucci (electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals), John Myung (electric bass guitars), Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion, and vocals), James LaBrie (vocals), and Jordan Rudess (piano, Hammond organ, synthesizers).  Much to my surprise (and delight), Jerry Goodman (ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra) contributes some tasteful and restrained violin parts on The Best of Times.  Overall, the playing is of the high caliber characteristic of the band.  However, I feel that Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci dominate the soundscape far too much.  John Myung has quite nearly been mixed out, Jordan Rudess is barely present, and even the role of lead singer James Labrie has been diminished somewhat.  Indeed, LaBrie's vocal parts are (at times) bulldozed over by spoken word passages (oddly, louder than the lead vocal part) and the coarse bark of the \\"cookie monster\\" vocal style.  Fortunately, the cookie monster vocals do not turn up too often.<br /><br />The six tracks range in length from 5 - 20 minutes, and present a fine blend of progressive heavy metal and (very) heavy metal, with not as much progressive rock.  There is however, enough in the way of superhuman instrumental pyrotechnics and dazzling ensemble work on the album that it kept me entertained.  Although the music is thunderous and more invigorating than caffeine, there are some nice dynamic contrasts provided by quieter sections that feature subdued electric instruments and acoustic passages (guitar and piano).  In terms of the tracks, my favorites would have to be the \\"ballad\\" Wither, and the Count of Tuscany suite.  At 19:16, this suite is the longest track on the album and the most interesting from a composition and arrangement perspective.  Unfortunately, the lyrics are fairly weak, which is a problem with some of the other tracks too.<br /><br />The one odd track on the album is Shattered Fortress, which consists in part of sections directly \\"copied and pasted\\" from previously released tracks, e.g., Glass Prison.  While it is understood that this is an attempt to link Shattered Fortress to other tracks and bring the song-cycle to a close, I can honestly say that I have never run across this approach to composition before (and probably for good reason).  Variations on a theme - yes; direct copying - no.<br /><br />In terms of the CD package it is pretty good and features pictures of the group and the lyrics. Unfortunately, the production quality is not so hot (Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album).<br /><br />All in all, while this is not my favorite Dream Theater album, and I found it a little too heavy for my taste, I still found a great deal to like here (in spite of my griping).  My personal favorites include Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002), Octavarium (2005), and Scenes from a Memory (1999).would have to be the \\"ballad\\" Wither, and the Count of Tuscany suite.

B0029NY9YO|5.0|In an alternate timeline, Nixon is still president and the world is sinking under the pressure of a cold war against Russia. A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.<br /><br />As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, \\"Watchmen\\" takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.<br /><br />The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.<br /><br /> \\"Watchmen\\" might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. \\"Watchmen\\" is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era.

B0019LY5IM|4.0|this show is so confusing it gives me a headache to the point where i have to watch it with the lights off so they dont irritate me.  i have always asked myself as i watched this show what was going on, but never to the extent of this season. flash forwards, flash backs, 1977, 2007?? it all got jumbled. many major characters sat back the whole season instead of getting involved, Desmond, Ben, Locke, Sun, and more. and the whole point of this show is that they are lost without rescue, now they are home and decided to go back because the island is moving throughout time. SO WHAT??? once they get back there is no plot line at all. they just hang out and do nothing, for example Jack seems content to be a janitor while Kate flirts with Bens Dad.    By the way, what was the whole thing where Ben gets shot, goes missing, and the dad doesnt think a thing about it. he just goes about his buisness after a short outburst. and after they return they can just leave on the submarine and get off the island for good. but they decided not to.     i dont know......    after all this they blow up a bomb that will send them back into the future and never have the plane crash. so how will there be a season six if they land just like they are suposed to. knowing the writers of the show it will end with Jack going \\"we have to go back.\\"     some advice, take out time travel from tv and movies forever.   lost is a good show and i will continue to watch it, maybe just to see how the whole thing ends.
B002436WFI|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie, actually the disk has a part 1 and part 2, so there are two movies.  The acting is very good, the story is great, and the photo work is first rate.  Part one is The Color of Magic (The Colour of Magic) by Terry Pratchett, a fantasy satire.  This is the first book in the discworld series.  Part 2 is The Light Fantastic the second book in the diskworld series.  Together they make the full story.  A great way to release a part one and part two of a story, together on the same disk, released at the same time.

B00004R7X5|4.0|Don't think what is played under Von Karajan's baton is certainly good. This is the proof. The sound and remstering are bad. The conducting, or Karajan's reading of this profoundly Russian piece of music, is almost good. It is ok. But there are several fine readings by Reiner, Stokowski, Fedoseyev. The cover design is the same as it is on the LP of this piece. It is nice. The 1812 overture is poor.
B000000W5L|5.0|Unquestionably - The Stones GREATEST album,cd/whatever.  It confused a lot of people in 1972 because, while the Rock and Roll was, as always, the finest available, it was kind of like...ummmm, maybe better check beneath the surface here.  And though Mick Taylor would be a Rolling Stone for two more years, neither he nor they would ever produce anything better.  MY only quibble is that now, with the new \\"remastered\\" blah-blah-blah available - really - isn't a \\"cleaned up\\" \\"Exile On Main St\\" kind of a contradiction in terms?  C'MON! - LEAVE it muddy & murky, that's what grabbed us in the first place!

If you're at all interested in Apollo and the early years of NASA, buy this book.  Collins has given us a warmly human, brutally honest, and side-splittingly funny story of his years in the space program.  However, hidden inside this history is a beautiful, haunting work that ultimately goes far beyond the astronaut memoir genre.  The final chapter by itself may be enough to rank 'Fire' as world-class literature.    Mike: don't know if you ever read these reviews but, if so, thanks for writing a really good book.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|My husband and I just finished watching this movie and WOW...its a definite 10!  I never dreamed that they could pull off the storyline and make it believable...but they did...and you believed every word of it.  This is by far Brad Pitts best performance and I have enjoyed almost all of his movies (Joe Black was his weakest role). Cate Blanchett also amazing as always.  The special effects (aging and getting younger) were simply awesome.  Flawless. My husband and I rarely agree on rating a movie, but this time we both agreed it was a full 10.  I never watch movies more than once, but I'm going to watch it again tomorrow.  Do yourself a favor...watch this movie.  It will stand the test of time.  It should have gotten more oscars...Slumdog wasn't even close to this one.

It's a BOOK!  $299 for a paperback??? You guys should be ashamed of yourselves for what you're doing.  You are exploiting him and his death and you should be ashamed.

0060512806|5.0|Publshed in 1999, Stephenson's military/suspense epic of codes and codebreaking tells two parallel stories, one set during World War II, and the other in the present (when the book was written, which was at the height of the dot-com boom). The title refers to a manual of codebreaking assembled over the years by the US military, and eventually declassified and released on the internet, where it has become a tool of programmers, hackers, and amateur cryptographers.<br /><br />One of the central characters is Lawrence Waterhouse, a quirky genius who studied mathematics at Princeton before being stationed at Pearl Harbor by the US Navy in time for the Japanese attack and the start of the War. Waterhouse is recruited to work on secret intelligence projects when his talent for breaking codes is discovered. His path intercepts those of a US Marine named Bobby Shaftoe and a chaplain named Enoch Root, and eventually he becomes involved with a conspiracy locate hidden treasure buried in the Philippines by retreating Japanese forces.<br /><br />In the modern story arc, Lawrence Waterhouse's grandson and Bobby Shaftoe's granddaughter are brought together in the midst of the establishment of a telecommunications startup business in the Philippines. But that venture is merely a front for a much more ambitious operation that could change the way in which business is conducted on the internet.<br /><br />Stephenson combines a vivid command of detail with a tongue-in-cheek sense of the surreal. He captures the everyday horrors of war along with the everyday absurdities that the fighting men are dealing with.<br /><br />The book also contains a nice array of geeky references to everything from the invention of the digital computer to Tolkien, Dungeon & Dragons, and collectible card games. In between, Stephenson waxes eloquent on economics, politics, Greek mythology, and of course codes and codebreaking.<br /><br />Interestingly, the biggest challenge for Waterhouse and his secret task group is not the breaking of the enemy's codes. The biggest challenge is how to use the information gained without tipping the enemy off that the code has been broken. The necessary black-ops dominate the first half of the WWII-era storyline.<br /><br />In general, I found that the WWII-era storyline held up better than the modern one. The modern plot relies a bit too heavily on dazzling the reader with technology, and ten years after the writing of this book, it is not always as impressive as it might have seemed in 1999.<br /><br />Still, Stephenson's characters are vivid and larger-than-life (his portrayal of General Douglas MacArthur is completely over-the-top, but it fits right in with the rest of the surreal cast and situations). His settings are lavishly described, and he does a nice job of talking the reader through the necessary mathematics for understanding the number-theory that underlies cryptography. It's a thick book, but it has very fast pacing, although the ending does come off as a bit rushed.<br /><br />This is also one of the most quotable books I've run across in a long time. There are some great one-liners in here.<br /><br />Overall, Cryptonomicon was a very entertaining read and should be fun for computer nerds and history buffs alike.y's codes.

First thing, at his peak Jordan's net worth was $100 million. Is that enough to call him wolf? Obviously not. On wall street, that is peanuts.     Secondly, he almost prides in being a drug addict. There are literally passages filled with how many grams of each drug he took. And he was apparently taking more than a dozen. And the details are repeated so very often that  you forget this book is supposed to be about wall street and some wolf.     Finally, this book would have been lot better had its page count been 250. He does have interesting things to tell but 520 pages is not what it should have taken.     I would say buy it if the price goes down to half, otherwise there are better books available at this price.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|This is the second worst movie that I have ever seen (First place goes to Mamma Mia). It was boring and the script was clearly written by a man or woman who has never lived in a mixed-race neighborhood, because it was clear that he/she had no idea what he/she was talking about.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series (the first one) and having seen the sequels; I set my expectation levels very low for this one; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream.<br /><br />I have to say... I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be. I don't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy, I would have to agree only with the editing. The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character. If you know your T- Series movies.. you know what I am talking about. Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment, Arnold coming back (sort of) as the original terminator which looked so real. They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984. Even the scar on John Connor's face (which is in a future scene on T2) was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator. Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch.<br /><br />I have to compliment the actors as well. I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese. Although, I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie's story line.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie. I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie, even though it's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating. I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I first heard the Moody Blues when I was a young teenager, probably about 1971. During my mis-spent youth I was at some friends house doing Psilocybin Mushrooms. They were playing music, the soundtrack to Easy Rider, Jimi Hendrix, and they played an 8-track called \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" by the Moody Blues. I never heard of the Moody Blues before, and I was totally blown away by there style of music, the speaking of poetry, the great harmonies, and fantastic lyrics. I asked these people, who is that group? They replied, Oh, that's the Moody Blues. I said man they're cool, I've never heard anything like that before. They said, \\"Yeah they're pretty cool\\".     After I got back home I knew I had to find me some Moody Blues. There was an Eckerds drug store close to where I lived that sold records and 8-track tapes, so I went in search of a Moody Blues Album, but the only one they had was \\"Days of Future Passed\\", which had great album art, so I figured this is going to be good. I got home and rushed to put it on the record player. Well I was a little thrown off by the sound of orchestra music at the start, something I never really listened to, or knew nothing about, but it had what I was looking for, that great poetry that I heard before, and a mystical quality that I never heard to such an extent in anything else I've listened to. I played the album over and over again, and started to like it more and more.    I was the only big Moody Blues fan I knew. Most people I knew liked Pink Floyd(overrated), Led Zeppelin(one of my favorites), or Johnny Cash(one of my favorites). I ended up eventually getting all 7 of the Moody Blues earlier albums, and at that time \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" was my favorite, very Psychedelic.    Now that I'm an old fart, I'm still a Big Moody Blues fan, and I own all seven of there great earlier albums, but now there on digitally remastered CD's. My favorite now is \\"Days of Future Passed\\", which I also have on an old LP. I'm an a.j. squared away citizen now, so no more drugs, but I do still like to drink some beers, and listen to the old Moody Blues from time to time.

1416550534|4.0|More Barbara Vine than Elizabeth George with Whatwasdone and Whydoneit being as important as whodunit. This book has a surprising number of passive characters - people who let tradition, circumstance and the will of others determine their fates.     As is often the case, there are several instances of 21st century opinions being voiced by characters from previous centuries. Morton does an admirable job of recreating the \\"downstairs\\" world of the servants in a great house although at times it feels slightly cribbed from Upstairs/Downstairs. The narrative is nonlinear, with flashbacks, dictated memories and letters recreating the story of what happened at the house at Riverton one night in 1924.    Grace is a refreshing lead character, starting out in life believing she is fortunate to enter \\"service\\" (being a servant in a grand house) only to later grasp the chance to become truly her own woman. Her doppelganger of sorts, Hannah, is more frustrated and frustrating. I couldn't quite make out whether Morton was presenting Hannah as a woman trying to break free of convention or as a woman who never fully matures finding make believe games and secret codes more compelling than real life. Perhaps Morton was trying for both.    Whatever the case this is an entertaining tale, decently written and in Grace, a character whose choices I found myself pondering after I'd finished the book.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|Just got complete series, read reviews & customers that wrote reviews are so right about the 'cardboard' bottle containing the DVD's, it will not last long, cardboard will eventually bend & won't look  the same. Seems like company wanted to save money by using cardboard. They should definitely redo the bottle, make it out of plastic, similar to the cases one buys with movies & replace at no extra charge to customers who have already bought the series thru Amazon. One shouldn't have to use plastic box it came in, bottle should look good displayed by itself. I had to place it back in plastic box it came in, also keeps dust getting in discs & eventually dust sticking to any disc can ruin it probably. The 'I Love Lucy' complete series did a much better job, even tho it is made of cardboard, it's pretty sturdy & well packaged where the discs are secure. It comes in a plastic see thru box like the 'I Dream of Jeannie', BUT, discs are inside the sturdy & thick cardboard base box & lid has a big red heart & a piece of thick cardboard between front & back hearts which is the lid to cover discs, it really keeps dust out of discs. A bit of cardboard at very bottom sticks out on sides where the box sits well. The bottle does not cover the discs unless placed inside the plastic box it came inside of, so one can expect dust to get in. Guess company who made this bottle didn't care to do an excellent job to make the bottle better & secure discs. It's still a very good price for the set, just keeping it inside plastic box & my main concern are the discs. It would be nice to keep bottle outside plastic see thru box to get discs from, but will just take out of clear box when I want to watch one of them. Tried playing 2 discs on season 1,disc one, the first one show the original intro, the other 3 didn't, partial part of show at start & then directed & produced & continued show, on 2nd disc each one had correct original intro. Anyway, enjoyed shows, but no English subtitles. Excellentquality on shows. Worth getting.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Top notch fantasy story in 3-D Stop Action Animation is deceptively simple. Shot like a live action film and powerful as a visual and aural experience. Through the looking glass concept fresh and engrossing. Perfect for adults of all ages. It's amazing that 'stop-action' continues in this digital world but the two work together for this sublimely creepy and fun film. 3-D is great for home format. 2-D is like 3-D. BD is awesome A/V. Dig copy has DVD and 3-D. 8 Glasses. You might not think you want it; I didn't and flipped when I experienced it. Good work.
0061767581|3.0|The only reason I read Lauren's book is because I'm a fan of hers from the tv show the Hills. L.A. Candy is a decent read, but it was extremely difficult for me not to identify Ms. Conrad's characters with her real life castmates. Personalities and plot details resembled episodes of the Hills and it was hard for to get invested in L.A. Candy because it was too similar to the Hills... What makes this read interesting is some of the behind the scenes things you learn. It must be a very surreal experience to wonder whether people are nice to you to get screen time, whether they've signed their releases to be on camera and that's why they're asking you on a date, etc... I would recommend this book to anyone who is not an avid Hills fan. It would be a better read without the prior knowledge of the people and experiences from LC's life blurring the line between the show and Lauren's book.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Not knowing much of Felicity Hoffman's work other than Desperate Housewives I was drawn to this movie due to its status as art film/low budget etc... and I was amazed to discover wonderful acting performances from particularly her but also from the other key characters.<br /><br />The storyline was anything but common, a woman trapped in a mans body dying for a sexchange operation suddenly realising she might be the father of a dysfunctional teenage son! What followed however was rather predictable, the two thrown together in a car driving across America, bonding and gradually developing a closer relationship.<br /><br />Despite the predictable outcome what was less predictable was how drawn into the improbable story we as viewers get and how we fast get to grips the almost absurd situations that emerge - we gain empathy with all the characters even though non can claim not to flawed...<br /><br />A great little movie - a nice surprise - and A HURRAH for independent film making which will never be able to steal the limelight from the big Hollywood productions but which often make for far better viewing.

B001KPYNR0|2.0|So, clearly one of the following has happened:  1) She ran out of new ideas after A Day Without Rain (Sorry, Amarantine was not very good).  2) Lord of The Rings somehow changed her career so that she can make more money by doing the same old thing. And that actually matters (I hope not!)  3) This theme album just didn't allow for anything really different because it was for Christmas, and her next effort will be way better.    Frankly, this is tripe. I miss the old Enya. I don't want to hear her sing christmas music. I want moody, breathtaking music with occasional pounding echoing drums to offset her smooth layered voices, not mellow, dainty songs about Jesus and toy soldiers and how time flies. Compared to previous works, that stuff feels really tacked on. Not interested.    Out of principle, I can't give her any less than two stars, because her voice is wonderful, and this isn't bad music. But I refuse to buy it or listen to it, and I never thought that would happen when it came to Enya. Wow.    I really hope she has something new up her sleeve. Otherwise, I hope she just stops, because another one of these will only tarnish her discography.
B00284BMBM|3.0|Leave This Town is a great cd but to me, it's not as good as the first album. I too got a bit suckered ino the hype about this cd. When they were talking about the upcoming album before they performed on American Idol, one of the guitarist - Josh Steely, said that there was a lot of great hard rock tracks on this album. It seems like it was just mostly some soft rock, a country style track, 1 hard rock track, and one half acoustic track mixed in. I was a little disappointed as I was hoping for more rock sound like in the 1st track You Don't Belong. I don't mind some ballads mixed in but the first album had more rock sound to it and that's what I really enjoyed. This album just has a soft rockin feel that can probably be compared to Lifehouse (One of my favorite bands as well). Chris's voice is still defiantly present on this album...even more so that the first and I think that's the glue of the band. His voice really sells the sound. I never reviewed his first album and I would have given that one 4 out of 5 stars. I would have given this one 3 1/2 (Almost 4)but you can only do full stars so I gave it 3. So, I'm giving this album 3 1/2 stars. It's great just not up to par for me as their first album.      1. You Don't Belong - 5/5 Love this opening track! My favorite out of the whole album. A fantastic rockin track!   2. No Surprise - 4/5 Great first single. Good sound and meaningful song.   3. Every Time You Turn Around - 4/5 Another one of my favorite tracks on the album.    4. Life After You - 3/5 Not too much of a fan of the ballads so this song is ok for me. Not great or fantastic.   5. What I Meant To Say - 4/5 Another one of my favorites. Great change of sound as it's not a hard rock song but it's got enough rock flavor to really sing along and get into.   6. Open Up Your Eyes - 4/5 Great meaningful song. I like this one more than Life After You cause Chris's voice is just amazing and I love the musical arrangement.   7. September - 3/5 Didn't really like this song. A bit too slow going for me.   8. Ghost Of Me - 5/5 My 2nd favorite of the album. Another great rockin track!    9. Learn My Lesson - 4/5 Again, great vocals from Chris and a great meaningful song.  10. Supernatural - 3/5 Not a bad track. I just didn't like the sound of it.  11. Tennessee Line - 2/5 I didn't like this track at all. I don't like the country flavor. I think Chris's and the bands strong suite is rock and they should stick with that.     12. Call Your Name - 2/5 I didn't like this song either. Although the second half of the song starts to really jam...I don't like the acoustic build up. If the whole song had sounded the same as the second half of it, it would have been great but the chorus repeats itself before it even get jammin.     Overall I was hoping for more rock in this album but it seems they went with the radio friendly sound. I still like Chris's sound so the album is still a great album to me. If they had replaced Tennessee Line and added in another rockin tune like You Don't Belong, made Call Your Name more rockin, and maybe changed Life After You or September to another rock tune, then this album would have been up to par with their first. The last 2 tracks pretty much killed my star rating. Just seems they lost a bit of their hard rock edge on this album and tones it down a bit. Still a great buy and listen as if you liked their first album, I believe you will like this one as Chris's voice doesn't disappoint!
0061020680|4.0|Young Mort is unsuited to follow in his father's footsteps, so it put up to apprentice in another trade. Unexpectedly, Death himself decides to train up Mort as a neophyte Grim Reaper so he can have a few days off. After all, what could go wrong? Well, as it turns out...    Mort was the point that a lot of people started taking more notice of the Discworld series. Smaller in scale than the first three books, Mort features Death as a main character and some thoughts and meditations on the nature of death and what may (or may not) come after. This is Pratchett in a more thoughtful mood, but he doesn't neglect the comedy. There are quite a few funny moments and passages, and we meet some more soon-to-be-iconic Discworld characters like Albert as well. But it's the serious thinking about life and the place of people within it that makes Mort stand out a little bit more than some of the other early books. Pratchett is also quite disciplined here, with a focused and tight plot that doesn't ramble like some of his other novels (which is sometimes entertaining, sometimes not), and this works quite well.    Mort is also interesting as the Discworld book that has been optioned several times as a big-budget Hollywood movie, but Hollywood has so far been unable to make it as they decided they wanted to remove Death from the book as his presence would be too much of a downer for American audiences to handle. Unsurprisingly and possibly thankfully, the film has never been made.    Mort (***½) is a step-up in quality from the first three books, with Pratchett stretching his author's muscles and discovering some new and interesting tools in his writing box. The next phase of the Discworld series, a more solidly entertaining and interesting series of works leading up to the series' first undisputed classics, begins here.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Not a bad adaptation of a book, but, as with many flicks, reading the book first will help the movie make sense. The book's creepier and richer, but some of the movie's musical numbers are amusing and creative in their own way.    The Wybie character might have been introduced to meet the PC/diversity compulsion of modern cinema. Wybie is a distraction, then an irritant, and finally his role destroys a major part of Coraline's character development present in the book.    So I'd say, buy and read the book first, then view the movie.
B002HFJ77S|2.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and was looking forward to buying this on my new Kindle. However, I can get it for just a little more at the bookstore, so I'm going to buy the book instead. I'm sure there will be lots of reasonably priced books for me to enjoy on my Kindle.

0786852550|5.0|Bartimaeus is brilliant! I just finished reading it for the second time after reading it with my pre-teen son a few years ago. I must say I enjoyed it even more this time. What a great treat! Smart and funny fantasy, with an internally consistent world and rigorous sci-fi approach to \\"magic.\\" And Stroud's writing is simply top notch. He dwarfs others in the genre.   Take a look at the negative reviews of this book on Amazon and you'll perceive three themes:   1) \\"The characters aren't really likeable.\\" True enough; Stroud's characters are more real than the oh-so-endearing cardboard cutouts you find in so many fantasy novels. The hero, Nathaniel, is a typical naive, self-centered punk. I find this to be a refreshing change.  2) \\"It's not Harry Potter.\\" Again, true enough. It's much better than Harry Potter, with cleaner, smarter writing and a more rigorous framework for the magic. Rowling can learn a lot from Stroud.  3) \\"It's confusing; the footnotes are distracting; didn't get it.\\" This reflects the fact that Bartimaeus is written for more advanced readers. Its vocabulary is broader, and the allusions and references are much deeper and more subtle, than they are in the typical young-adult fantasy novel (such as HP).  In sum, Bartimaeus isn't for everyone, and specifically not for young children. It's for advanced young-adult readers and for adults whose favorite type of fantasy involves multi-dimensional characters in a rigorously well developed and internally consistent world.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I really like this movie, both for the action and for what I believe to be fairly realistic portrayals of war.  It is action-packed, but it's emotional to me because of how realistic it is.  It is raw with real language, real injuries, and real death.<br /><br />Several people have reviewed the movie content already, and I wanted to review the quality of the blu-ray version.  I've seen this movie several times, with the most recent before tonight being on DVD this past weekend.  I almost didn't buy the blu-ray because of recent reviews here about how the blu-ray isn't much if any better than the DVD.  I disagree.  I am impressed with the video quality of the blu-ray.  I have a Panasonic TC-P50G10 television and DMP-BD60 blu-ray player, and I believe that they do a pretty decent job of upscaling DVDs.  While this movie may not be the best showcase for blu-ray, the blu-ray version is certainly a step up in terms of video detail.  It is unquestionably high definition.  The details on text (names on helmets, subtitles, etc.) makes it easier to read, facial details show off the characters emotions better, and the image quality of the M-16s made some scenes more realistic to me because I've shot similar weapons.<br /><br />One thing that I did notice is that the blu-ray has one less track marker than the DVD - there isn't a new chapter near the beginning when they get the code to start the mission.  I mention this because that is one of my favorite chapter markers.  I find that scene to be pretty exciting with the helicopters taking off.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie a lot and have a high definition TV, then I'd say that the blu-ray version is at least worth a rental.  I don't regret the $16 that is cost me to buy it at all.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|There's a lot that's very entertaining and impressive here. I did not know much about Watchmen before I bought this DVD. But I don't think you have to know a lot about the graphic novel on which this is based to enjoy the film. The film builds upon the fascinating premise that a group of flawed people got together and fashioned themselves into \\"superheroes\\" who would try to fight crime and protect the innocent. They dressed in wild (intimidating) costumes, developed overpowering strength, and became masters of the martial arts, killing machines. And, for the most part, they were determined to help mankind.     But these superheroes were not perfect, omnipotent beings. Indeed, a couple of them were not much better than the criminals that they fought. Some engaged in criminal behavior themselves. They were humans, and as history teaches us, humans are good at tearing things apart in the name of noble goals.    But it just went on and on. This film made me wonder why movies usually last about 90 to 120 minutes. It must have something to do with attention spans, patience, and focus. So, why not make more movies that run, say, 162 minutes, like this one? By about the two hour mark, I could have cared less about what happened next. No matter how creative, how stimulating, how daring the images on the screen became, I found myself zoning out. Compounding this, I don't think the film finished as powerfully as it started.    My favorite segment was Rorshach's (Jackie Earl Haley) prison break. He and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) were my favorite characters. In an imaginary revised version of this overlong production, I would introduce the other characters and the alternate version of 1985 that the film so brilliantly constructed.  But save much of the rest for a sequel or two.
0887307280|5.0|This book assists small business people through its consulting and programs. Its basic proposition is that the key to real prosperity in business is to work on your enterprise, not in it. In another words, the book aims to be a lifeline to those stuck in the quagmire. The book is a recipe for putting your self back in control of your working hours - in short, to be able to work on your business, not in it. The distinct Gerber's message is that if your business is to thrive, it will engage you in a process of constant personal development. For it to change, you have to change too. In order to do this, you must have written goals. As Watson put it:\\" Everyday at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business\\". Finally, the success of this book coincides with the boom in business franchising, in what Gerber called \\"turnkey revolution\\". Franchising has a system (eg Mc Donald) which epitomises speed, orderliness and simplicity. This is another way of saying that the key to real prosperity in business is to work on your business, not in it.
0765350386|5.0|Although I consider myself a fan of the genre I am a very picky fantasy reader. So many themes and elements seem to be so overused and quite frankly boring.   Not so with Sanderson's Mistborn. While some of the main plot elements may not be completely original (progigy protagonist and evil empire) the world Sanderson creates is fresh, original, and even rather believable. The magic system is extremely creative and well thought out (and something I would die to see in a movie or video game) and the characters are likeable and unique. Another personal suprise I discovered about 200 pages in was the depth of the political plot involved (amidst Vin and the noble balls) which is not something that normally holds my attention but this one did throughout.   Of course, the plot-twist are what really make this book shine. What an ending! I can't wait to finish the trilogy. I highly reccomend this book and it was well worth the read.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations.

I also highly recommend Mansfield Park also by Jane Austen.

I cannot rate this album less than 5 stars (much more if I could) even I was really disappointed to find out that one of my favourite song is not \\"Original\\" version.     I don't know, but I would like to ask person who has responsibilty in album's sale advertising not to use the world [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED] or [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] with this CD, because it's not all \\"original\\".     For the song \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" the original album version featured a spoken intro by Michael himself and with a longer version of the opening music.( I'm sure you will have a good dream hearing his voice say \\"I need you..I love you so much...\\" before going to bed..(*^^*))
0385342020|5.0|I've loved all Sophie Kinsella's books, so, naturally, I ran out and bought this one when it came out, and finished it a few hours later.     Definitely her best book yet, I found myself laughing, smiling, and even getting misty at the end of the book.      Fantastic read.
0786838655|5.0|This is an excellent book to begin students on a love of Mythology. Following mythological writing guidelines, the author introduces modern day youth to a very old structure. The Greek (and Roman) gods and goddesses are presented in traditional mythological adventure style through a protagonist/antagonist style set in the modern era. There is adventure, conflict, internal struggle, friendships formed, and rules to be played by. This would make a great classroom tool to get kids interested in mythology from a modern tie-in, and then lead them into the original tales as they move through the book. Highly recommended!
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is a book of common sense wisdom that I would rate as an easy read - I finished it in a couple hours.  It's wrapped in a bit of spiritual talk and background, but the core of this book was very helpful to me, even not being a particularly spiritual or religious person.    Here's my paraphrased look at the four agreements, in no particular order.    1) Be impeccable with your word  2) Don't take anything personally  3) Don't make assumptions  4) Always try your best    Simple mantras, but Ruiz does not sugarcoat things - most of us have been trained heavily through our culture to disregard some if not all of these things, so changing this behavior will not be an overnight thing, and we will have setbacks.  The book points out examples of how most people disregard these agreements, and ways that the agreements may help you in the long run.    I highly recommend this book.  As mentioned earlier, the core approach is really common sense, but I appreciate Ruiz's presentation and think it will be effective for many.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|This is my first Japanese watch and I love it. It is worn to work and it's very accurate. The automatic movement runs about (+) 15 seconds a day. The bracelet is not greately made, however it is very comfortable. I tend to ware it every day even when not at work.     The description on the website says 46 mm diameter. That's not accurate. They come in 42 mm. You won't be disappointed. I have been waring this timepiece for 2.5 years and still love it.     I gave it a 4 because nothing in life is perfect. There is always room for improvement.

0525421033|4.0|In Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES, the murdered girl watches from heaven.  In Gabrielle Zevin's ELSEWHERE, the hit-and-runned down girl dies and watches from a place where she begins reverse-aging in preparation for a return to Earth as a new baby.  Here, with IF I STAY, we have a new entry with a slightly different twist -- a girl who is the sole survivor of an early-chapter car crash that takes the life of her parents and little brother.  Not dead (yet), her life hangs in the balance at the ICU in the hospital.  Author Forman provides her with an out-of-body point of view, so she gets the \\"Tom Sawyer visits his own funeral\\" treatment by being able to observe her visiting relatives, friends, and boyfriend even though her body is unconscious.<br /><br />Overall, it works, even though this protagonist is a bit too good to be believed.  You see, seventeen-year-old Mia is blessed with cool parents and a funny little brother.  She loves all three of them and, through many flashbacks, we see no sign of familial discord ever.  What's more, she's a cello player.  Not just ANY cello player, but one good enough to make it into Juillard.  And, to cap it all off, she falls in love with and wins the heart of Adam, a guitar-playing rocker who serves as yin to her yang.  In short, Mia's is that rare sort of life that the reading demographic (girls, chiefly) would gladly suspend disbelief for in order to enjoy vicariously.<br /><br />Despite the storybook life, Mia's story is (there's no other word for it) sweet and Forman does an admirable job narrating it.  She expertly weaves long segments of flashback between present-moment ICU updates and drama.  We learn about Mia's parents, grandparents, musical background, and, most importantly, relationships.  There's her bestfriend Kim and there's Adam, the rocker.  If she stays, it will be to serve as Eve to her Adam, but she's tired and depressed over her loss and leaving seems the easier choice, given the state she's in during the course of this book.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'd say this is as close to a \\"sure thing\\" for teenaged girl readers, even reluctant ones, that you can get.  If you like the \\"look back from death\\" genre, all the better.  Recommended.k.      Bottom line: I'd say this is as close to a \\"sure thing\\" for teenaged girl readers, even reluctant ones, that you can get.  If you like the \\"look back from death\\" genre, all the better.

B001RFIGQ2|5.0|First of all, I just have to say that I did not care for Demi Lovato when I first heard of her. I just knew she was in Camp Rock and that's it. But then, sometime in April I saw her perform on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and she was AMAZING! Her live performances drew me in. I then went to one of her concerts and thought it was incredible so I went out and bought this deluxe edition CD. Turns out the bonus track on the CD (Behind Enemy Lines) is one of the best songs on the CD.    All the songs are amazing except for one, On the Line. I believe that if it was sung without the Jonas Brothers it would've been better. I also realize that this CD was Jonas Brothers influenced since they helped her co-write almost the entire album so I was surprised that it would be this good.    Very good first album for Demi! The features on the Deluxe Edition probably isn't worth the money unless you are a die hard fan though. It includes about 30 minutes of extras. The only reason I would suggest that you go out and buy this version of the CD is for the live performance of \\"Don't Forget\\" at the Wiltern. It's very emotional and made me want to cry myself. I'm glad I bought this because that is a performance I will remember forever!    Props to Demi Lovato for making me fall in love with her voice.
0385737424|4.0|WHEN YOU REACH ME is an interesting hybrid, being science fiction in contemporary realistic fiction's clothing.  For the most part, it's the charming tale of a 6th-grade girl, Miranda, her mom (who's angling for a spot on the show, THE 20,0000 PYRAMID, and her mom's boyfriend.  Then there's her friend who's not her friend, Sal, a mysterious boy named Marcus who punches Sal for no reason, and her love interest Colin (contemporary enough, yet?).  Finally, we have her best friend Annemarie (rich), her rival Julie (rich), and the Laughing Man (the homeless crazy that seems to appear in every New York City-set novel).<br /><br />The book works for two reasons: it's not only a rich characterization novel, it's also a compelling plot book.  That is, author Rebecca Stead plays the mystery card by having these odd notes showing up where Miranda can find them.  These notes not only predict the future about events intimate to Miranda, they do so accurately.  Who's writing them?  And what do some of these strange statements even mean?<br /><br />The big clue lies in Miranda's favorite book, A WRINKLE IN TIME.  In fact, I believe that Stead herself may have been influenced by the adult bestseller, THE TIME-TRAVELLER'S WIFE, when writing this.  See if you don't catch a few scenes that are reminiscent of that book.  All in all, though, despite a somewhat rushed ending and the usual paradoxical headscratchers presented by any time travel text, this is a fast-moving and interesting read.  The characters will be good company and you'll genuinely be interested in the resolution.  You may not understand it, but you'll be interested in it.  Recommended, this YA book can be enjoyed not only by girls but by boys as well.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|George Lucas please die, so that the smart people in your company can take control and make the right choices for the maximum profits and bring out the first original triogy on BLU. They know that continuing the Star Wars films is money in the bank, and good business, not counting the support of a loyal fan base. We are all tired of your crappy lies about Star Wars, the original unedited theatrical releases coming to BLU and getting everything but. George you don't care about any of your fans, unless they are buying all your crap. What ever happened to the third set of trilogies that make up the trilogy of trilogies, huh? You continue to lie about every aspect of your films and promises that you have made, PLEASE JUST DIE ALREADY.
0140430725|5.0|I feel fully unqualified to pass judgment on Jane Austen, it is true. But I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus of acclamation that has attended it for decades. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book--a masterpiece because of its writing (difficult and archaic, but beautiful), its plot (excellently woven and fully believable), and its characters (in whom Austen has perfectly captured the tendencies and caprice of human nature). It is lovable, enthralling, candid, and resonating.<br /><br />I don't like writing reviews that make the product sound flawless... except in this case, where I really believe it to be so.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|This is just to point out something not mentioned in the description. As you know, this comes with an exclusive Nite Owl Ship.    First, it looks cool. Nice details, looks 'properly used'. But here's the thing. After I unpacked it I noticed a slip of paper at the bottom of the box. It described how to replace the batteries in the Nite Owl Ship. Wait... BATTERIES?    So I then discovered the ship is made to easily come off it's stand. Under it there is a battery compartment. It requires a small Phillips head to open. I opened it to confirm... yup a battery compartment with two batteries!    But for the life of me I could not figure out what the Nite Owl Ship was suppose to do! I saw no switch. So I even tried talking to it... nope, no voice recognition.     *** spoiler **    Finally... I figured out the top plate (circular on the very top) is a hidden switch! You press it... and it lights up (detail lights and bright main front lights)! And, for about 5-10 seconds... it makes the SOUNDS of the Nite Owl Ship flying around! The lights stay on until you press the hidden switch again...    This ended up being much more than advertised! :)    And of course the movie is great... but you already know that (or else what the heck are you reading this for)!!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a wonderfully insightful and well crafted film that asks more questions than it answers, such as: What is humanity, or rather, the essence of humanity? If we are not just skin, bones and blood, what do we as a species have that no other species has: the ability to think abstractly? to influence others? to shape our relationships and to bond with others? Or is it a unique combination of all of these qualities that makes us human? Does David's mother teach him to love, or does David teach his mother to love? This is a breathtakingly beautiful film and one of Speilberg's finest, his tribute to Stanley Kubrick, well worth seeing and thinking about!

B00001U0DP|5.0|Life Is Beautiful is an extraordinarily significant work of art. Screenwriter/Director/Actor Roberto Benigni takes Tragicomedy to new heights, even as he pays tribute to the finest work of Charles Chaplin. Benigni plays Guido, an Italian Jew whose ethnicity is suddenly and shockingly targeted by the Nazis at a time when he is growing a young family- after having, literally, fallen upon the \\"Princesa,\\" the woman of his dreams- as well as a fine bookstore.     A genuinely happy, warm and charming person, Guido, along with millions of other Jewish people, is now beset by woes of almost horrificaly unimaginable proportions as he and his little boy are taken away by the Nazis to a concentration camp. His intent, no matter what may follow and above all else except keeping his child physically alive in Auschwitz, a place and time where Jewish children were systematically gassed and killed, is to protect the innocence of his young son by pretending the whole horror is a game, the end of which, if he plays right, is to win a tank.     Guido's wife, who is not Jewish and not sent on the train, insists on accompanying the rest of her family, husband and son, to Auschwitz, much to the surprise of the Nazi soldier at the train station; her life is her loved ones, something he does not understand.    The strikingly beautiful cinematography- including exceptionally rich use of color, choice of camera shots and movement, set- and costume design-, editing, stirring musical score and fine surrealistic touch reminiscent of Fellini, make this film enjoyable and poetic in a visual sense, because there is rhyme and reason to each decision made by Benigni as screenwriter and director, as they blend with the dialogue, acting, story and theme to create a finely crafted, richly inspired, tragicomic masterpiece that brings forth tears of abject sadness amid the light of Guido's sense of play and fatherly protection- \\"You always did want to go on a trip,\\" he softly tells his little boy as theyare carted off in the death train amid the foreboding musical passage that accompanies this shot.     This seems bizarre but it is only the beginning of this man's overwhelming desire to shield his beloved child from the pain of the reality that confonts their family. In fact this preparation was actually, in a sense, begun before that, when Josue playfully hid from his mother in a little cabinet to avoid taking his bath, with his father in collusion with the game, something that winds up saving him from the fake \\"bath\\" at the camp.     The use of extreme close-ups is reserved by director-screenwriter Benigni for the most poignant point in the film, where a final wink from Guido to little Josue hiding in the cabinet places the seal on the reality of their game of survival and preservation of the child's innocence.     Survival in the physical sense and also in the emotional or psychological sense is Guido's role as father/protector of his child. Other high cinematic/editing feats include those such as the skillful, unobstrusive change of time from the courting of his wife stage to the realization of their family they created, five years later,in one single shot. This makes clear the family/child they created is a direct result of the love they have for each other. Cinematic poetry is unfortunately a rare phenomenon on the big screen, so this one is a true gem. It should be watched in the original Italian, because the true voices of the characters that people this film belong to them and should be heard by all.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Coraline is simply outstanding!  Well written...well directed/produced. If you love Tim Burton type movies (i.e., Nightmare Before Christmas, Sweeney Todd, Edward Scissorhands), you will love Coraline.  A bit scary for the very young, but overall an outstanding story & movie.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|This program was recorded October 1, 1992 and became the stamp of approval solidifying the legendary status of the King of Pop. Michael Jackson's \\"Live in Bucharest\\" is a triumph. Watching this presentation literally pulls you into the screen. The stirring power of this personality oozes throughout the concert. One of the most memorable parts of the concert showcases Siedah Garrett (background singer and writer of \\"Man In The Mirror\\") sharing the stage with him on \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You.\\" This duet, as passionate as it was, transitions into \\"She's Out Of My Life.\\" He calls a female audience member on stage and she's in awe of this mere mortal on stage to the point where she had to be carried off the stage by the event security. WOW! This stage technique has often been duplicated by the likes of Bobby Brown, Usher, Justin Timberlake and many artists after MJ blazed the trail for other known performers. Overall, The Dangerous Tour is Michael's finest performance since the Bad World Tour in 1987. The sound quality could have been better, but nothing can diminish the precision & timing of the dancers, the quality professionalism of the band and singers spearheaded by Greg Phillinganes & Brad Buxer on keys and the rhythms of the great Ricky Lawson. As a footnote, this was a pioneering concert in which the producers utilized on stage ProTools editing with added vocal & musical programming, a proponent that is widely used today in various live shows and stage presentations. (All hail Bruce Swedien!) I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this energetic masterpiece. Rest In Peace, MJJ! You were a supernova! A true gift and an icon to this society! \\"GONE TOO SOON.\\"
0767827791|4.0|Everyone in this film is superb in their respective roles. Verna Felton is golden, balancing the sometimes overwrought tension with a wisdom that brings warmth to the story.  The dance sequence between Holden and Kim Novak is my favorite moment in the film. While \\"Moonglow\\" plays, the theme to Picnic enters the moment and perfectly counters the other tune. The dance is somewhat awkward but it has a primitive quality that, for me, brings out the sensuality.  Kim Novak was absolutely beautiful and, with her curvy body, looked every inch the woman. Too many contemporary actresses, in their skininess, look like teenage boys, or Q-tips as the current description goes. With its many layers, Picnic is a film to watch more than once.
0385336950|4.0|[Two books by the same title were published the same year; the other of this name went on to the best-selling list. I bought this one in error but, as it was about Alaska, I kept it and have now read it.] During WWII, the Japanese bombarded the US mainland with incendiary balloons. This campaign was not revealed until after the war. This is the story of a young man sent to defuse the bombs; he also needs to defuse his commander. A local Yup'ik woman fortuneteller is involved with both men as well as a Japanese spy. Lovely scenes of Alaska but also new information on the balloon campaign. Well-written and suspenseful, the book adds a hint of native spirituality to the mix and the story moves along nicely.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is a beautiful and amazing film. The work that went into this is astonishing, and it shows in every frame. While not for small kids who scare easily, it is for a wide range of people... including adults! A wonderful story, and a film that takes the art of what cinema can do to a new level.
B0014VPFTA|3.0|Over here in Europe, John Mayer is pretty much unknown. I saw his perfromance at Michael Jackson's tribute concert, and thought I'd try a bit further.  From what I read and heard on the net, Mayer wasn't going to be my cup of tea. I like my guitarists heavy and soulful, sometimes shredders, but also bluesy.Then I found a three cd box (his three studio albums) set for a fair price...  Mayer falls in the soulful, bluesy category. He's good at what he does, altough his songs are a bit too \\"poppy\\" and could do with longer solos to my taste. the production is clean (too clean IMHO), but again, in that kinda music, it's okay.  So, overall, I'm quite pleased with this cd, but Mayer is not gonna become my new guitar hero, and I believe he might be a bit overrated.  In my opinion, there's a bit too much of Sting and Clapton in his music rather than Hendrix or Zakk Wylde.  Still good music, easy listening.
0316010669|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell clearly loves knowledge for knowledge's sake.  Each piece of his proof has excessive details that are so interesting and compelling that I thoroughly enjoyed this audio book.

6305428352|5.0|Every time I watch this movie I cry tears of happiness at the end, even though I know how it will end. This is a thoroughly heart warming story with excellent acting performances from Richard Dreyfuss, Glenne Headley William H Macy and Olympia Dukakis. I believe Richard Dreyfuss should have won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.     What this movie teaches me is that you can find your calling in life, be fulfilled and happy doing something that you love and succeed beyond your wildest dreams, even if it doesn't result in financial success.    As I was watching this film for the nth time today I was thinking how nice it would be if they came out with a two-disc edition with more special features commentary and cast interviews.

0743486285|5.0|I have read this book about 25 times since I bought it back in Dec. 2007. It is amazing to see how deep in addiction Nikki was and how far out of that black hole he has climbed. He lived AND died to tell the tale. Nikki really could have pushed this as a \\"woisme\\" story, but having his fellow band members, relatives, friends, etc. give their insight on the Nikki or \\"Sikki\\" they were forced to deal with at that time was very brave of him. Artists have deep feelings and Nikki is a true artist. This tale of addiction does have some humorous anticdotes, but it is not romanticized by any means. \\"Gorgeous rock star hides in closet trippin' out on the regular\\" is the backbone to this story. Read it if you want the truth behind the fame curtain.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|[[VIDEOID:36709731]]This video shows the unboxing of this edition.<br /><br />My review. This movie is amazing. The quality in the direction of where Zack Snyder takes this film is spot on! The characters are great and each shows their own personalities and feelings that just add more depth to the film. This movie was made to be watched on Blu-ray in 1080P and on a nice HDTV flatscreen(Samsung 1080P 120hz!) The features are great, one of my favorites being the PiP(Picture in Picture) where you can watch the film while simultaneously viewing another screen that shows how a scene was made, illustrations and more! I highly recommend this Blu-ray to everyone who enjoyed the film or for those who want to see a complete marvel in its own graphic scale!
0375842209|3.0|For the first half of the book I really tried to like it; for the last half of the book I really tried not to hate it. In the end, I must have been partially successful, because I did read the last fifty pages enthusiastically; though, now I feel robbed.      It isn't so much that the book is bad; it's just that it isn't very good---and it isn't very good for 500 pages. For a long time I struggled to figure out why. None of the usual suspects appeared: the author's politics don't creep into the story, and it isn't preachy; the writing style is simple, direct and clever (Zusak makes copious and effective use of synesthesia, for example); and the narrator of the story, Death, is sympathetic and witty without being trivial.     Then it finally occurred to me.     This book, set in war-torn Nazi Germany, is not peopled by living, breathing, bleeding human beings; instead, Zusak moves his characters like chess pieces. Each one is studied, obedient, and ... lifeless.     First there is \\"Papa.\\" \\"Somehow,\\" we're told, \\"Hans Huberman always knew what to say, when to stay, and when to leave her [the protagonist] be\\" (265). That's right: totally perfect, totally predictable, and thoroughly unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, you like Papa a lot, just like you like Santa Claus, but you know he isn't real.     Then, since this is a book set during the Holocaust, there is the obligatory Jew-in-the-basement character. He's 24. He's desperate. And when he is alone, what does the young man \\"fantasize\\"? Well, the only thing a Jew in a basement could possibly be expected to fantasize about: not family, not lost love, or sex, or even the guilt of such fantasies... No, he dreams about boxing Adolph Hitler in the big ring.     Umm, really? Boxing? Hitler? In the ring? Honestly, you'd have to add warm water and use a mallet to make a character any flatter than that. Is that all we can expect from the mind of a Jewish fugitive --- boxing Hitler?     Finally, for all the to-do about books andthe importance of words in the main character, Liesel's, life, we learn little about them beyond their titles. This, despite the fact that she has read them repeatedly!    Devoid of philosophical depth, psychological truth, or literary finesse, the book ultimately has very little to offer, even (I would suggest) to the young adult audience it has been marketed for.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  I have a new respect for my dogs now.  I loved how this book was from the view of the dog.  Some of the plot did drag a little, but it wasn't enough to ruin the story.  I rarely cry at books.  The only two that made me cry were Tuesdays with Morrie and Marley and Me.  Now I can add a third to the list.  It was a good cry though.  If you love your pets as much as I love mine and Denny loves Enzo, you will love this book!
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|SKY HIGH is a Disney movie about a high school, SKY HIGH, for the children of superheroes.  Here, they study to be either a) superheroes or b) sidekicks (aka Hero Support).  As with any high school, there are social cliques, raging hormones, and impossible homework, but SKY HIGH takes it all to a whole new level.<br /><br />It is the first day of high school at SKY HIGH for freshman Will Stronghold, son of superhero power couple The Commander and Jetstream.  Unfortunately for Will, he is a bit delayed and has not yet developed his powers.  He washes out at \\"power classification\\" and is shunted off to the sidekick track.  To make matters worse, he learns that, in very rare cases, the offspring of two superheroes may never develop powers.  Will makes the best of his situation, but is very worried about disappointing his top of the heap parents.  And of course, there is evil lurking about, and it seems to be targeting Will's family.  Will Will get his powers in time?  Will he get them at all?  Will he be able to save his family and the world?  Tune in to SKY HIGH to find out.<br /><br />Is SKY HIGH predictable, campy, and clich&eacute;?  YES!  Did I know exactly what was going to happen from the very beginning?  YES!  Was it immediately obvious who the real heroes and who the villains were?  YES!  Did I care? NO! NO! NO!  SKY HIGH is cute, sweet, and perfect for families.  There is no bad language, no sexual innuendo, no gore, and nothing more than mild comic book violence.  Just plain, good, clean fun.  I, personally, found myself grinning throughout most of this film, enjoying the sheer cuteness of it.<br /><br />The entire cast does a nice, campy, over the top job of it (hey, they ARE superheroes and super villains, after all), but I especially enjoyed the appearances of Lynda Carter, Cloris Leachman, and Bruce Campbell.  The story is typical Disney, with a happy ending and good messages.  SKY HIGH teaches kids to be true to themselves, true to their friends, and true to what they believe, all wrapped up in a live action comic book.  SKY HIGH is an easy, breezy, light-hearted summer flick, perfect for the entire family.rapped up in a live action comic book.

Even if you're not really into the whole vampire genre you will dig this series. Anna finally shows us more at the start of Season 2, that's a bonus!

0060775858|2.0|Goodnight Moon? Ha! What a joke. Margaret Wise doesn't seem too wise to me, writing foolish books about bears in chairs and bowls of mush. What is mush? What is that? It looks utterly disgusting, like something they would feed you at a nursing home.     I also don't want my child (who is a beautiful baby boy) saying goodnight to his food. That's just plain weird. Even though I never intend to feed him the \\"mush\\" the mother forces down her child's throat in this gut-wrenching novel, I don't want kids to make fun of him on the playground when he waves goodbye to his PB&J as he throws it out.

No context, no explanations, just sudden catastrophe and confusion, filmed by someone clumsy. On that level, it was extremely well presented. Great special effects. Great audio. Everything from the flickering of the lights to the background noises, was timed to be eerie, disturbing or intensely interesting. You don't look away.    So why didn't it work better?    Part of the problem is that the movie is so derivative. It feels too much like a cash-in on 9/11, and it feels too much like a gigantic homage to Alien. Somehow you feel like you've seen all this before. It's Godzilla, done bigger and better for the sake of bigger and better. Aliens, but scaled up.    Part of the problem is, as well as the actors conveyed terror, fear, bravery and foolishness, at no time did it feel authentic - and they tried so very, very hard to be real. I think it was more the storyline's fault than the acting. The characters just don't engage, even though the script was filled with events and points that just begged you to care about them. Somehow, the plot just tried too hard to make you care. But I was rooting for the monster the whole way.     If you can find it cheap and really want to see a believable enactment of disaster response and chaos, this is a good choice. But it's not something I expect to see again. Two and a half stars, and those mostly for the special effects and camera work (which WAS well done, for what it was).
B00288KNLS|4.0|I absolutely loved this film; however, I want to warn everyone that the insanely cool 3D effects that you saw in the film are NOT duplicated for this DVD release. Instead of the comfortable, plastic glasses (that fit over my glasses very comfortably), we get four, old school, blue and red (except now they are green and violet) headache-inducing cardboard cut-out glasses like studios used to use in the 1980's in theaters. The picture, instead of clear and stunning, is now flickering green and violet. It is very distracting. I couldn't watch it for more than a minute before I had to remove the glasses and return to the 2D version, which is also included in this DVD. I have no idea why the studio has made this switch (my guess is money issues), but it is very disappointing to go from a magical experience in the theaters to one that I will only share with my friends in 2D, as opposed to the incredible 3D that I have been raving and anticipating now for months. The film is still great. It is just a let down if you were expecting the same 3D effects as was shown on the big screen. Just wanted to warn all of you ahead of time.
B001LV5OOY|4.0|White Lies are a Rock trio and their debut CD \\"To lose my life\\" has topped the charts in their native UK. Their brand of gloomy danceable Rock with shimmery synths and trilling guitars recalls acts like Editors, Interpol, or even Franz Ferdinand in places. Catchy songs with dark subject matter that get even catchier each time you listen.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"Death\\" and the harrowing sounding \\"To lose my life\\" (\\"Let's grow old together, and die at the same time\\") and \\"A place to hide\\" (nice drumrolls) fall into the Dance/Rock bracket. Slowing things down is \\"Fifty on our foreheads\\" (with horns adding to the ambience).<br /><br />\\"Unfinished business\\" with it's hymnal organ intro reminds one of Coldplay's \\"Fix you\\" but the lads soon put paid to any such notion. It's a pulsing mid tempo number with chiming guitars which picks up to a galloping pace and lyrics about zombie lovers, a definite standout! \\"E.S.T\\" is a shimmery sounding midtempo Rocker with a droning riff (and gloomy lyrics about a Manic depressive), while \\"From the stars\\" starts off as a nice ballad (lyrics about a millionaire's breakdown belying such sweetness) before galloping away.<br /><br />\\"Farewell to the fairground\\" is a beautiful song with throbbing synths in the verses and cutting guitars in the chorus against dancey beats, and lyrics about a haunted fair. This is my favourite, along with \\"Nothing to give\\" which is a melodramatic piano/string ballad (with percussion and swirling electronic flourishes coming in the final minute), and closing is \\"The price of love\\" (interspersed with marching beats, glossy synths and interesting tempo shifts - The Killers would kill for this song, pardon the pun).<br /><br />Not since The Smiths has doom and gloom sounded like such fun!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I grew up in the 80s and my first album I ever bought was Michael Jackson's BAD. I've been a fan ever since and just recently bought this DVD for nostalgia. I was dancing through most of it, but ended up in tears crying by the end. Watching this concert again (saw it when it was on HBO) on DVD now made me realize why I loved his music so much and what a talent that's been lost. During the song \\"Heal the World\\", I actually had to leave the room because the tears were starting to flow. A beautiful song from a really great performer. All of those memories of me listening to his music as a kid really came back and the thought of his death really hit me hard in those few minutes of the song. The good news is that his music will live on in my life and the life of every other fan and fan to be that will discover his music in the future. It brings nothing but good memories. Way worth buying. :)
1416549447|2.0|I have read the reviews of this book and am impressed with how generous most reviewers have been. There are lots of reviews throwing down a 5-star vote and making little comment on the book itself, so don't let the star power sway you too much.    One of the hurdles I experienced with the book was Dreyer's charlatanesque pitchmanship. I would prefer if he put out his ideas and let us judge them. Instead, you will be bombarded with testimonials and self-praise from the author.    Some of his \\"science\\" is just painful. Maybe he's trying to be funny when he says, \\"People admit that they intentionally taught themselves to breathe slowly so no one would know how out of shape they were they were; meanwhile they were killing zillions of brain cells to look good.\\" - Really, braindeath from altering your breathing rythm?    There's a well-informed reviewer who cites Dreyer's confusion or at least lack of specificity when he talks about hip-flexors powering running. The kinetics of running are more complicated than that. Regardless of body lean and balance point, you're going to have to activate other muscles to keep your leg from collapsing.    So the science isn't spot-on. Regrettably the discussion of Chi isn't terribly solid either, as other reviewers have noted.    These complaints unfortunately overshadow what I think is some good theory on being mindful of your body and evaluating your running form. Mr. Dreyer has apparently experienced some success as a runner and his techniques appear to have helped quite a few people. I do resent that he tries to lump everything that isn't \\"Chi Running\\" as \\"Power Running\\".    Ultimately, I feel that Dreyer's book is a preachy rehash of ideas that can be found better explained elsewhere. It feels like the eastern medicine is thrown in to sensationalize things a bit. I'm glad to have read it, but won't be keeping it in my running library.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|What a good movie.   You just watch and really get into it.   Highly recommend it.   The language is rough but somehow fitting.   The bits of comedy are gems.
0545123267|5.0|SHIVER is absolutely one of this year's best books.  The writing is beautiful and the book flows so well.  I couldn't put it down!  I found myself really living in the character's world at many points in the book.  The descriptions are amazing and add so much to the already perfect storyline.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  There's not enough good things I could say about it!
B0027WNRIG|3.0|This is the album where Leppard traded in their loyal metal fan base for the riches of the MTV-friendly hair metal crowd. Those of us that supported this band when they were a scruffy nwobhm act who had 1 decent but poorly produced album (On Through The Night) and 1 excellent metal release (High N' Dry) were stunned when we first heard this abomination. Lange's grotesque production sapped the balls right out of this band - burying them under so much gloss and studio trickery that what was once a lean and mean machine got turned into a hair metal nightmare.    Back in the day this one split the metal community right down the middle. Half of us (like me) ran for our lives to the first METALLICA or MERCYFUL FATE album we could get our hands on or took solace in British bands like SAXON and MAIDEN who kept their hard edge (or in SAXON's case at least waited a couple of more years to go soft).    The other half got on the hair metal train and ended up listening to MOTLEY CRUE and even worse.    So - why three stars and not 1? And why did I even buy this thing? The answer is that in many ways I've made my peace with this record. I still think it has an awful production. I still find well over half the songs atrocious pop metal. But the live disc is actually excellent - and contains many of the best songs from \\"High N' Dry\\" - which is the only DEF LEPPARD album I truly love and these are great live versions. Not only that, some of the better \\"Pyromania\\" tracks are given their testicles back in the live environment (where Mutt's dubious production is thankfully nowhere to be found) so thats another plus. And the great Brian May makes a guest appearance. This is a five-star concert.    1 divided by 5 gives this one a 3. For fans of the studio album this is a 5 star release. For people enamored of LEPPARD in their heavier days the live disc makes this worth a purchase - IF the price is right.    After this LEPPARD went on to the commercial and sales heights of \\"Hysteria\\" - but I'll skip the rant on that one.

B002C2XXJY|1.0|I really do not care for this album. She is very over rated as a singer.
0385341008|4.0|I'm not sure there's much I could add to the heaps of praise this book has already received except to say that it is well deserved. The book is a treat from start to finish. It's a crying shame that the world is deprived of more books from Mary Ann Shaffer. I'll be amazed if someone doesn't turn this book into a movie.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I just watched Watchmen, the Directors.    It was Riveting through out it's entirety.     I have read the Graphic Novel more times than I can count ever since the 12 issues came out in the mid 80's.    I still read those 12 issues and compilation issue. The greatest Graphic Novel ever made.    With out a doubt this is one of the closest film renditions of any book that has ever been made into a movie.    My only critique is the ending and the changed reason for the explosion(s).    I can't wait until the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\"
B001FB55H6|4.0|I'll say this right now: I don't like Zack Snyder as a director and I admit I outright laughed when I saw the trailer proclaming him as a \\"visionary director\\". No, the likes of Spielberg, Kurosawa, Scorsese and Kubrick are visionaries, Snyder is at best serviceable in making likable movies but completely off the mark as much as it succeeds. I am probably one of the few guys that outright hated \\"300\\" so I wasn't exactly looking forward to \\"Watchmen\\" and I'll admit on first viewing I didn't like it. But unlike \\"300\\", somehow Watchmen got better on second viewing and while I still have issues with it, it at least shows Snyder improving as a director; it's just unfortunate he wasn't at his A game when he made this one.    It's 1985 unlike the one we had where President Nixon is enjoying his 5th term as president and the world ticks ever-so-closer to nuclear war, shown visually by the Doomsday Clock, which inches gradually to midnight. Helping out the city were the Watchmen, a group of costumed superheroes who were then outlawed or put under government control by the government after protesting of vigilantism. But when the Comedian, a.k.a Edward Blake, is murdered, attention now comes back to the Watchmen as they try to figure out who murdered the Comedian as well as if they have the capability to halt the impending nuclear war.    A lot of director's cuts are usually extended to either provide an alternate version of the film, a kind of optional \\"if you want to\\" version where it doesn't really add or subtract from the film but gives you an alternate take on the movie like Terminator 2 or Alien whereas most of the time this is the director's preferred cut; the one they wanted to make that got sidelined thanks to intervening executives. With the \\"Watchmen\\" and its director's cut, one can actually see that a better movie was hiding underneath than what we got theatrically as scenes are aloud to breathe a lot more, things are fleshed out and the overall pacing, while stilla long movie (hair above 3 hours), is at least a little more likable. However, that still leaves things a little awkward in terms of the whole where pieces of the movie work really well like the jailbreak scene and the assassination attempt on Ozymandias and yet things in the middle just kind of feel \\"there\\" and never really connect or add to the movie's flow.    As far as the casting is concerned, it's a bit inconsistent. Arguably, the best thing Snyder did on the movie was casting Jackie Earle Haley as the seriously messed up Rorschach and now it's hard to picture that character or read the graphic novel without his voice and performance being remembered. In many ways he's the best thing about the movie and I'd even go as far as saying it's similar to the great performance Heath Ledger did as the Joker. (Might even have my new Halloween costume, HA!) As for everyone else, well Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes a good lasting impression with what little screen time he has and Carla Cugino has the first Silk Spectre is good as well and yet I found Billy Crudup's voice as Dr. Manhattan to be, well, more like bored or lazy than detached and unemotional and the should-be awkward and poor shaped Nite Owl is instead played by handsome looking Patrick Wilson so unlike say the X-Men movies where there was barely a miscasting, here it's like one works but somebody else doesn't fit the bill.    One thing that Watchmen does do is look rather stunning in Blu-Ray and many times I was like \\"wow, now that's impressive\\" and many scenes such as the crashing of glass at the end of the movie, a late-movie explosion and even the detail on Rorschach's mask where you can see the strands and thread is quite outstanding. However when you look at the way the film was shot well, this is Snyder we're talking about and the words \\"slow motion\\" will frequently come to mind. It's clearly a style-over-substance tactic he's using and he does severely overkill it at times but the clarity on the Blu-ray transfer at least makes it look cool. Also note that this is a particularly violent film and there's quite a few parts that'll make you go \\"ooooh....\\" in wincing.    For those of you who are wondering, there is a bigger edition coming out in December which will include most likely an even longer cut and other things in the package which is not surprising considering \\"300\\" just came out with its, what, Blu-ray release? But as a movie I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this; now I have to go watch \\"Zodiac\\" again and make sure my tastes haven't been diluted with time.
0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt's book is by far the easiest economics book to learn and actually apply in real life. The book is relatively short and gives great examples of how things actually apply and play out in real life. This book will give many a great fundamental understanding of real life economics and not the tooth fairy stuff taught in your textbook. You can actually apply Hazlitt's lessons from each chapter to real life. This book is the layman's best friend.
B001TW69J4|5.0|Their are literally thousands of excellent bands going unheard by the main populace of the Metal lovers world wide, however very.. Very few even grasp this level of musicianship, creativity and sheer brilliance. Tosin Abasi formerly of the much overlooked group Reflux is the heart, soul and mind behind this modern masterpiece that Metal and Hard Rock fans can not afford to overlook.<br /><br />The album starts off with a unique blend of jazzy rhythm backed by trance styled synth then erupts into a barrage of technical pummeling rhythm guitar and crushing drum work. Soon all that is overtaken by soaring technical and mesmerizing leads and soon the jazzy beat and synth returns and slows things down as Tosin lays down some superb acoustics then the track explodes into a barrage of crunch rhythm and powerful leads.<br /><br />After only hearing the first track I knew immediately this one man was easily one of the best guitarists and all around musicians in the industry. I can agree that this music is difficult to label but it is most definitely somewhere in the grey area between Progressive and Technical Metal. But honestly labeling something so fresh, new and inspiring is unfair, simply enjoy the music.<br /><br />The follow up to the opener is a far more melodic track loaded with tranquil acoustic guitar, unique leads and engrossing atmosphere. This at the very beginning gives you a dramatic contrast to how this man can perform several spectrum's of music flawlessly. The follow up to the melodic second track is a chaotic Tech Metal song, that wouldn't be out of place on a Meshuggah album.<br /><br />As a guitarist myself I am inspired to improve my own skills after listening to what Tosin has accomplished with this release and I am sure other guitarists will also be very pleased with the album. Only two more known bands come to mind when listening to this album, first is the obvious Meshuggah on the heavier side of the music and Cynic on the lighter end of the spectrum. Yet Animals As Leaders still holds it's own and is impossible to simple toss it off as a rip off of what others have done.<br /><br />In my opinion this is possibly one of the most singular significant releases in the past ten to possibly twenty years for the Metal Industry. Few groups (aside possibly thos already mentioned) can pull off such a unique sound, creativity and the engrossing amount of musicianship. Tosin Abasi has proven himself a master of his art and all we can hope is that Prosthetic Records keep him in the loop, but after hearing this I can't see how any record label could toss him.<br /><br />Fans of Progressive and/or Technical Metal obviously will enjoy this and is a must own. Fans of Instrumental Metal will also be another obvious fan base as the album has no vocals what so ever. People who enjoy Metal that has a more Eclectic and unique style can also appreciate this as well as the music from beginning to end stands next to none.<br /><br />All in all I think all fans of the Metal universe need to listen to this at least once.. It is a ground breaking release from a man that is basically unknown in the industry except within small circles few and far between. Pick this up and support an artist that truly has the skills others claim to posses. In my opinion this album just went straight to the top of the list and is the best Metal Album of 2009 to date. Do not overlook this one. Thank you for reading.holds it's own and is impossible to simple toss it off as a rip off of what others have done.

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I've read the book and listened to the Stephen Fry narrated audio version.  Films are not meant to duplicate the literal experience of the novel.  This film stunningly succeeds in avoiding that trap.  Whenever it can tell the story visually and artistically rather than through dialogue and linear plotting, it does so.  Its visual style reminds me of Cocteau's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" and Bergmann's \\"The Seventh Seal\\". Mesmerizing from the first surreal opening reel to the end, this is every bit deserving of its current box office success.  Harry Potter and friends now live in a world which Lord Voldemort has insidiously penetrated at every level.  Both the magical and mortal worlds are on the verge of collapse.  Harry with Dumbledore's assistance must find the way to defeat Voldemort.  As they explore one memory after another, they discover that Voldemort has split his soul into other, hidden portions and Harry will have to find and destroy each soul.  The scenes  of magic, evil, delving into memories and battles make you feel as if you are there in that other, magical realm.  Dark, foreboding, stunning.  See it.
0783225733|3.0|This is a long movie, and it certainly seems like it. Perhaps its Tom Hank's typically low-energy acting, or just that the movie doesn't recreate the suspense over 30 years after the incident, but I just find it heard to sit through this movie. At times, it starts to seem like the Tom Hanks show.    If there is any redeeming factor to the movie, it's the fact that it later led to Tom Hank's [[ASIN:B000A0GYD2 From the Earth to the Moon]] television series, which is excellent. That series focuses on the entire Apollo program and has a great set of actors [the series includes an episode on Apollo 13, but it also isn't very good]. I would actually give [[ASIN:0783225733 Apollo 13]] an extra star just for leading to that series. On its own, the movie just isn't very satisfying.
1577314808|4.0|Zen has been teaching this for centuries, for example, in Shunryu Suzuki's Zen Mind Beginner's Mind you can read:  \\"We should find the reality in each moment.\\" (the power of NOW is the author's more dramatic way of saying the same thing). And how do you do that? \\"Just sit, that is enough.\\"  True understanding is actual practice itself.\\" (Suzuki, page 97). \\"Moment after moment to watch your breathing, to watch your posture is true nature. There is no secret beyond this point.\\" (page 135). The best way to develop Buddhism is to sit in zazen-just to sit, with a firm conviction in our true nature. This way is much better than to read books or study the philosophy of Buddhism.\\" (page 130). \\"Teaching is no substitute for practice.\\" (page 135). \\"If you want to be a sincere Buddhist the best way is to sit.\\" (page 130). It's that simple. And Eckhart Tolle seems to agree on page 114: \\"We are not trying to understand it. There is nothing to understand.\\" (it is felt). That means you could stop reading and get on with the simple practice of sitting counting your breathe and \\"watching your mind\\" or something like that.  This is a too long a summary of the essence of Suzuki's and Tolle's message. Zen and NOW are in the end a practice that is beyond words. As Tolle warns many time, words get in the way (but he keeps writing them). It is a mistake to focus on the words in this book and rave about it as if it is some kind of Bible. That would not be Zen like (or NOW like).  My review already has too many words. I have got to stop NOW so that you and I can go and sit quietly (or something like that). That is all you really have to do according to Shunryu Suzuki and Eckhart Tolle.  But, obviously, this book is of tremendous help for those seeking more explanation and instruction and from repetitive reading do not get stuck on mere words. I subtract one star so as not to rave.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album has all of the basic Beatles hits. While it's not as comprehensive as the Red and Blue albums, it's pretty much most of them. The only notable exceptions are that it's missing Strawberry Fields and Back in the USSR.
B000N3H95S|4.0|Mike Oldfield made sure to list on the back of the vinyl pressings 'This stereo record cannot be played on old tin boxes no matter what they are fitted with. If you are in possession of such equipment please it into the nearest police station'. Comical? Yes. Seriously speaking though this is one highly progressive album that deserves this regard to quality.<br /><br />Two songs, two very long songs each climbing a mountain of sounds and instruments for your listening pleasure. Due to so much variation \\"Tubular Bells\\" qualifies for a repeat listen. Ardent tube guitars, spikiness mandolin like guitar, caramel covered carousel organs, spanish influenced classical guitar, Oldfield crafts it all. When we think of one man bands like some of John Fogerty's work or modern day musician  Dave Grohl (referring to Foo Fighters debut album, we think in the realms of rock. Oldfield with a little help from his friends on the flute Jon Field, Lindsay Cooper on string basses, and drummer Steve Broughton, go outside this parameter triangulating a fulfilling experience.<br /><br />Not to say one man bands are bad, or progressive rock, but fans of both may enjoy the multifariousness even though it's not strictly rock. It has many ingredients brewing, they all manage to peak in flavor with out becoming saturated and begin overflowing with nonsense. Yes you get two tracks, if it helps you sleep better the album isn't scarce and is moderately cheap as an audio cd, the vinyl copy is even cheaper well an original pressing anyways. Plus the two tracks feel more like  a heavy movement of tracks instead of one long epic. You'll lose yourself in one segment and forget it's one of the TWO TRACKS.<br /><br />Never is a sense of urgency felt here, the music changes at will, no anxious deliveries. Unexpected arrangements and music indeed, but not so overbearing that one part will turn you away from the album (it's all part of the experience).<br /><br />So as side two of my record ends its final rotations you may find yourself as consumed with this as many are with the list of instruments listed on the back that Oldfield plays.<br /><br />Side notes: While I do not own the CD version, I own the original vinyl LP. From what I understand the early 90's CD release sounds much better then the later reissues, if it's the one I'm thinking of from Rhino Records then I know it's in good hands. They've done marvelous things with other prog rock artist (like their Yes reissues).<br /><br />Many reissues seem to be sprouting out of nowhere for vinyl enthusiasts, I notice some of the 180 gram copies are dirt cheap right now pick them up! Make sure it is indeed the 180 gram version under the sellers notes as some just bunch them in with the others to make a quick buck. If you're daring try grabbing the 200 gram pressing, not sure how much this goes for.

B00004STPT|5.0|This is Hans Zimmer's masterpiece and will probably go down as his greatest soundtrack. The music really evokes the fury of battle and the majesty of ancient Rome. Whenever I listen to it, it evokes images from the movie. If you own one Hans Zimmer soundtrack, get Gladiator.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I didn't think Daughtry could possibly top their debut album, but I have been proven wrong!  \\"Leave This Town\\" is, in my opinion, even better than their chart-topping debut.  I'm not a music expert and I don't know about guitar riffs and chord progressions and other such technicalities, but I do know good music when I hear it.  And make no mistake, this is GREAT music.  I especially like \\"No Surprise\\" (can't get that song out of my head!), and \\"Meant to Say.\\"  Chris Daughtry's voice is superb and I find the lyrics of all of the songs meaningful and well-crafted.  If you liked Daughtry's first album, you will love \\"Leave This Town\\"!!!
0671449028|5.0|My little boy loves this book. We read it just about every night and he points to the pictures and squeels with delight. Even my 7yr old will sit down and read this book to him. We all have it memorized and we just love it!
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|The Director's cut of Watchmen is finally available for the masses. And while I'm ashamed to say it, I'm worried that this movie will fall into the category of \\"Cult Classic.\\" \\"Watchmen,\\" although brilliantly directed, has some of the cheesiest and cliched hero dialogue I have ever heard. But aside from all it's faults I absolutely LOVE this movie. And one reason is, drum roll please... Jackie Earle Haley! I think his performance as Rorschach is Oscar worthy. He completely brought the character of Rorschach to life and I would put him up there with Heath Leger's portrayal of DC's infamous Joker. I will admit that I had never even heard of the graphic novel before the movie trailers came out, but as soon as I found out it was based on a graphic novel I ran right to a book store and bought myself a copy. Much like \\"Sin City.\\" I was thrilled to discover that all the hype in the trailers was true. The graphic novel is absolutely amazing, if somewhat convoluted and too descriptive at times. It really was the \\"comic that defined comics...\\" This film's casting is perfect, except for the casting of Malin Akerman as Laurie. She does a decent job... it's just that I think they could have hired a better actress to play the part. I don't have any suggestions but then again I'm not a casting director. Which I guess negates my whole complaint. But in any case if you like stories about people who have no actual super powers but are classified as \\"Super Heroes\\" this movie is probably for you. And if not... then screw off! Haha just kidding. But seriously, screw off.

Yes, there's political undertones...that's America!  Get past that part and, it doesn't matter where you stand politically, you will be screaming \\"USA! USA!\\", by the time you finish the book!!    Well done, Marcus - it was an honor to read your story.

0375842209|4.0|It's just a small story really, about among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist-fighter, and quite a lot of thievery. . . .<br /><br />Death is the narrator of our tale - and as narrator's go, I actually thought he was quite interesting. He's not as depressing or as loathsome as you might think Death would be. He doesn't wear a cloak or carry a scythe - although he does like that image of himself. And I found it quite beautiful when he describes how he would come for a dying person's soul.<br /><br />Our story takes place during World War II, Germany - where Death first encounters Liesel at 9 years of age, as he comes to collect the soul of her little brother. He becomes captivated by her, watching as she steals her first book. Liesel is on her way to meet the new couple who will be her foster parents and eventually her new family and home. I fell in love with Liesel and willed her to survive from chapter to chapter, and cheered on her relationships with her accordion playing Papa, a potty-mouthed Mama, a fist fighting Jew hidden in her basement, a boy with hair the color of lemons, a spitting neighbor, a depressed mayors wife, bonfires, air raids, drawing, reading, stolen books and the power of words.<br /><br />Mr. Zusak has used a teenager as the voice for the struggling German people. When we think of Nazi Germany - we think of concentration camps, the millions of deaths, and a society that just went nuts. But this gives us a view of the German people and how they were affected by a leader who knew how to use words as his weapon - making them believe that his way was the only way for their country to prosper and be great. Liesel's story focuses on what the situation really was like for normal-everyday German citizens.<br /><br />I really can't say I loved this story. Don't take me wrong, I found it very interesting and I really did fall in love with the characters, but I found that I wasn't fully engrossed by it. It was a bit difficult to get through the first couple of chapters and even took me a bit to accept that Death was our narrator. I also didn't like that there was so much foreshadowing - meaning by mid-book I already knew what the outcome of most of our characters would be. When Death is your narrator - you sorta know what the outcome is. I also felt that the epilogue was a bit rushed, I would have liked more details - so it really didn't leave me as fulfilled as I would have liked. But all in all, it is a book that I would still recommend. The story line, the details and the characters are well worth it.to get through the first couple of chapters and even took me a bit to accept that Death was our narrator.

B0012X3ZGK|2.0|Fire And Water was a classic rock album if ever there was one.  Free was a great band and their legacy is well deserved.<br /><br />My problem is with this deluxe release.  It's mind numbing.  How many versions or rehearsals of \\"Alright Now\\" or \\"Fire And Water\\" do you really need to hear?  Yes, the original album is classic five stars like I said and the mastering on it is very fine indeed.  However the BBC tunes on the rest of disc one are of borderline bootleg fidelity (and that's being kind).  Disc two actually has great live tunes and a couple interesting remixes........but hey, let's have MORE All Right Now rehearsal takes?<br /><br />Good grief enough already.  As great an album as this was, listen to both of these CD's in one setting and you'll put the thing down for at least a year.  This is total overkill.  Like another reviewer said, keep it simple.<br /><br />Collectors will have literally everything on this anyway; causal fans don't need much more than the original album.<br /><br />Save your money.
0525421033|5.0|On a wet, cold and snowy morning 17 year old Mia decides to take a ride with her parents and younger brother to visit family and friends. It's a Snow Day for them and they've decided to make the best out of this impromptu day off. They jump in their car and head off... in the blink of an eye, Mia is standing by the side of the road watching as her injured body is being pulled out of the wreckage. As she travels in this state, between life and death, she watches as her body is transported and treated for injuries, as her family and friends all gather in the hospital, and as she makes the toughest decision she'll probably ever make... should she stay?<br /><br />To be honest, I can't gush enough about this book. I found it to be unputdownable. I fell in love with Mia, her family, friends and her boyfriend, Adam. The underlying importance of music was also very moving. I loved how the characters express their feelings toward music and how music affects them as a being. The characters are very well-developed and you can't help but fall in love with them all, from the trendy punk parents to the hipster teens. Mia's memories are like a family photo album full of snapshots of happy times.<br /><br />This book is about friendship, family, love, life and the tough decisions we are faced with in order to have these things. It is a well-written and well-formulated story which makes you think long after you've turned the last page. There were times where I laughed and some where I cried, and although it wrenches the heart, it definitely is not one to be missed.<br /><br />Getting some insider info on the book - I just read that Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) will direct the movie. That's definitely something I'll be looking forward to. If it's even half as good as the book was it'll be worth the time to go see it.

0312360266|4.0|Marked is the first in the House of Night series. We are introduced to Zoey Redbird and a world where vampyres have always existed, where you are tracked down by what resembles a bounty hunter and are \\"Marked\\" if you are one of the chosen to learn the ways and eventually become a vampyre. In this case, the story starts with Zoey being marked within the first couple of pages. After the \\"Change\\" she is taken to The House of Night (a school for fledgling vampyres-in-training) where she is to begin her new life away from her family and lifelong friends. As it so happens, Zoey is not your average fledgling, she has been favored by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx to be her eyes and ears, so that alone causes her to be somewhat of an outcast, but luckily for her she is paired up with a fantastic roommate who introduces her to a wonderful group of friends. Soon after her arrival she starts discovering her powers as well as that other students also have their own special powers and are misusing them. Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny, with a little help from her new vampyre friends.<br /><br />For some reason I had been staying away from this series... I think it was just a bit too mainstream for me. But thanks to some friends (and I won't mention who), I was told how fantastic they were, how I would love them, and I was not disappointed. Although I did find myself comparing the story a lot to Harry Potter, once I got past that, I really enjoyed the whole gist of it. I loved the fact that there was a special vampyre school where your classes started at night and you had these great subjects (like fencing and equestrian classes).<br /><br />I will forewarn though, that considering that this is a book geared towards young adults, it did have a fair share of sex in it. But with that said, I did appreciate the \\"opinions\\" expressed in the story about sex, drugs, and alchol. I don't think it took away from the book, on the other hand, I think it helped to build Zoey's character as a non-conformist and moral young lady.<br /><br />This is a unique spin to the basic vampire story. Not too shabby I must say. Plus, I liked the subtle cliff-hanger at the end, so I'm definitely intrigued. This first book sets up what appears to be shaping up to be a really great story, and I will eagerly seek out the sequels.Zoey's character as a non-conformist and moral young lady.

B00003W8NM|4.0|This movie, despite it's misleading title, doesn't have all that much to do with fighting. If you think this is some best of the best street fighter type movie, you're wrong. There are actually only a few fight scenes in the entire movie, although they do get pretty brutal. This is really more a film about the human condition, and mind. What makes us tick. Why we do what we do, and the absurdity of it all. The cultist sheepish mentality in which we live our lives.  Ed Norton's narrative in this movie is truly hypnotic, as are the visuals. It's a well written, well acted, beautifully filmed thought provoking movie. I totally disagree with the movies leftist and violent anti-establishment message, but I throughly enjoyed the movie nonetheless. There are a lot of thought provoking comments and moments in the movie that might just make you rethink certain elements and behaviors in your own life.   It's an interesting look at how we perceive ourselves, how we cope, what we value, and what we disregard. All of the characters in this movie are heavily flawed people.   The plot jumps around a bit and some of the story elements of the movie are a bit tough to swallow including the major plot twist of the movie. Overall, This is a very unique movie, and well worth seeing. I always notice \\"cigarette burns\\" at the theaters now.  The irony of this review and all the other others here, is that Tyler, one the main characters in the movie, would probably ridicule me for writing this review and you for wasting your time reading it. Honestly is anybody reading this review not seen the movie? People may read reviews about equipment and electronics before purchasing, but I seriously doubt most people come here to read a review of a DVD before buying. And more to the point, what you do you care what I think? Your life is ending one minute at a time and you are wasting it reading my review. Watch the movie and decide for yourself. Or don't.
1416550542|5.0|This story follows the lives of three women, set in three time frames (early 1900's, 1975 and 2005) but all linked together through a garden, on an estate in Cornwall. The story mostly revolves around Nell and the mystery of who she is, where she came from and how/why she ended up where she did. Nell was abound on a ship from England to Australia. She was found stranded on an Australian dock at the age of four. At that time, she was taken in by Hugh (who oversaw the dock) and was given a family and a home. On Nell's 21st birthday, her father told her the truth of how she came to be a part of his family - a truth that changed the rest of her life.<br /><br />The book mostly revolves around Nell's mystery although it's told through several points of view spanning a little over a century - Cassandra (Nell's granddaughter - 2005); Nell (1975); and Eliza (early 1900's). At first it was a bit disconcerting all the jumping around from character to character, but I quickly got over that and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The writing was splendid, I loved Ms. Morton's descriptions of London and Cornwall at the turn of the century. Her characters were likeable and well-developed. With an interesting story and plot that had enough twists and revelations to keep the pages turning. The fairytales scattered throughout the story were my favorite part - I kept looking forward to each one. The book itself is a thing of beauty - with it's illustrations of frolicking fairies on the inner flap of the covers.<br /><br />This was just a joy to read!! and I recommend it to anyone that loves a good mystery with a beautiful historical backdrop.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Reading the negative reviews about this movie ticked me off. It seemed they may have watched a different movie all together! The movie is as perfect as it could have been and tells the story amazingly. It's a PSYCHOLOGICAL thriller. It is a long movie and worth the trip all the way. Frightening as hell and perfect in that regard.     MAKE SURE YOU \\"WATCH-IT-ALONE\\"! So others will not break your concentration and take your mind off it.
031606792X|1.0|There are just so many things about this book that I don't agree with that there is no possible way for me to be able to explain each one of them without sitting here all day and having done nothing but complain. So, I am just going to say that I was *horribly* disappointed in this book. The first three were absolutely wonderful; I loved them. I loved reading them. I tore through them faster than I have ever torn through any other book. But this one...after the first 500 or so pages, I wasn't even interested in knowing how it ended. I just wanted to put the book down and never bother to finish it. I wanted to be done with it that badly. It just didn't hold my interest. I was about as entertained while reading this one as I was while sitting in a history class in high school. And history was always my worst subject because I couldn't stay awake.     The beginning was just too sappy. And the rest of the book was rushed through the writing process. I feel that there are some things that should have been explained but weren't and so because of that they just didn't make any sense to me. I literally found myself hoping that Bella would keel over or that someone or something would go ahead and put her out of my misery before the end of the book. She got on my last nerve because she was stupid in this one. She made stupid decisions and she didn't listen to anyone. Edward seriously should have put his foot down with her...or on top of her. Either one would have worked.    This book was...WOW...just a huge disappointment for me. I would love to read the first three again at some point (after the hype over all of them burns down), but I think I'm going to skip this one the next time. I managed to finish it once. I don't think I will be able to do it again. Getting through the last 200 pages once was torture. I'm not sure if I want to put myself through that again.
0618526412|3.0|\\"In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together.\\"  This opening line in Carson McCullers \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\" lured me into a world of discovery.  The story isn't one of adventure nor is it the revealing of a crime committed.  The author simply sets you in a small community of 1930's southern culture and presents everyday characters in everyday circumstances.  What the reader discovers is how different people and circumstances mixed into the same pot can produce a flavorful brew.<br /><br />Thanks to the writing of McCullers, the meal in this book tastes like a home cooked southern meal with all the trimmings.  I believe the author set a slow pace to the story to allow for easier digestion as well as contemplation of what ingredients went into the meal.<br /><br />The talent of a gifted writer is to be able to describe a place and people to their audience with honesty.  Carson McCullers does this to perfection in this book.  Though we as readers may not fully understand all the parts people play in this book, McCullers was aware of every detail she put into the making of her creation.<br /><br />I wasn't taken so much by the story as I was by the writing.  I could have put the story down at the half-way mark and read something more exciting, but with a style of writing like McCullers you miss it as soon as you begin reading something else.<br /><br />To be in the presence of great literature is to discover the shortcomings of our own thinking and ideas. 3.5 stars
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Like the title said, this is easily the best and most credible album a Disney artist has ever put out. Demi is a real talent and definitely deserves much much more credibility than any current artist her age (she is only 16!) in my opinion.    I could give a song by song review but I won't and instead cut to the chase here. The songs here have variety, substance, melody, and excellent vocals. Songs that I think deserve special mention are 'Got Dynamite', 'Catch Me', 'Everytime You Lie', 'U Got Nothin' On Me', and 'Falling Over Me.' Believe me when I say that this is a \\"Disney\\" album like no other, a DEFINITE BUY FOR ANY MUSIC FAN!
0545123267|4.0|Vampire romances don't have anything on this werewolf story.  As a young girl Grace is attacked by a pack of wolves and is saved by a yellow-eyed wolf who turns out to be Sam.  This leads to a series of summers and winters as they yearn to see more of each other.<br /><br />Years later Sam and Grace meet when Sam is in his human form for probably the last time.  Their developing romance is entrancing and you can feel the tension of neither one of them not wanting it to end.  The supporting characters are also an interesting cast.  I especially enjoyed Isabel, the sister of a newly turned werewolf.  Rather than being a turn off her sarcasm made me laugh and I enjoyed her spunk.<br /><br />There are a few things that were not really explained and I just have to wonder if a human has sex with a werewolf would their children be werewolves?  I would mention the other questions I had but I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone.  Let me just say this was a wonderful paranormal, young adult book.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Love it from start to finish. There is always at least one song that really catches my attention at first listen. That song on this CD is, \\"Open Up Your Eyes\\". So effin' nice...not sure what the deal is with the negative reviews. This CD is awesome...ps, LOVE THE CD COVER!   -  Update: After listening to this CD about 8 times, I love it even more. And consequently, my favorite new song on it is \\"Tennessee Line\\", the duet with the awesome, Vince Gill. My prediction is that it'll be a smash hit on the Country charts.
0679736646|5.0|This is one of my favorite science fiction books ever.  It was like the Twilight Zone written in a parallel universe, in which telepathy is real.  It is not so far fetched that someday life might be preserved by letting people survive in a cryogenic state while their minds remain active.      Ubik is a mysterious substance that the protagonists hope will restore the world to sanity.  Remember, it's not US that are insane...it's THEM!    Maybe I will come up with an air freshener called Ubik and market it.  What do you think?
B00006HAZG|5.0|Dickens has become my favorite author of all time.  His novels are still relevant to this day - 150 years or so after they were written.  It takes a bit of time to settle into the formal style of 19th century British writers, but once you get into the flow, the stories are great, the characters come alive in sparkling clarity, and not one plot element is left hanging.  Long reads? Yes, definitely, but well worth the time and effort.  I would wager that you will be sorry to see the book end if you persevere.  Why were these books such drudgery to read when assigned in school?  Maybe it takes some years in the world to appreciate what Dickens left for us.
B00009ZYBY|4.0|A 5 Star \\"sword and sandal\\" summertime blockbuster fantasy/action flick and classic morality tale.<br /><br />Thinking of what throwaway title to use for the review I recalled the South Park crew's mockery of Crowe's accent in the film. But who knows or for that matter cares what a Spaniard sounded like a couple thousand years ago? Surely not like Crowe, but the Romans didn't speak English or look too much like many of the actors portraying them in Hollywood films! And who cares about actual history? Nobody watching \\"Gladiator\\". Except for the \\"realistic fight scenes!\\" and new digital depiction of Rome and it's Coliseum of death we aren't too concerned. Marcus Aurelius was a real Emperor, last of the so-called \\"Five Good Emperors\\", and a great stoic philosopher, but events depicted in the film are loosely based in fact or fabricated.<br /><br />However, I can appreciate \\"Gladiator\\" as a well-crafted morality tale of honor, loyalty, and betrayal with some cool fights. Director Ridley Scott has brought to us some of the most gorgeous films of the last 30+ years.
0156027321|2.0|I couldn't put this book down.  This guy can write.  But, coming to the end, I was left with nothing.  No epiphany of any kind.  No emotional or intellectual satisfaction.  Just a sense of wasted time.
0307454541|5.0|It's rather hard to say, as to how he did it, but I believe Stieg Larsson has written one of the best thrillers not only of this year, but of the decade as well.  The author puts a little bit of everything on the table, from crime, mystery, tech, family saga, and even business and economics. And despite being nearly devoid of chase scenes, shooting, dead bodies, and other thriller staples, this strange genre-hybrid of a novel hits all the right notes.<br /><br />I bought this one for a long road trip, thinking it would last me the week. It was done in two days, and only because I had to sleep. Everything from the stories of Salander's sordid past life to the strange and multi-layered hustory of the Vanger family kept me glued to the page and guessing all the while. The plot was smart and believable, the characters were real and sympathetic, and it was all wrapped up perfectly in the end.<br /><br />It's books like \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" that keep the relatively stagnant thriller genre afloat. It deserves to be a classic of the genre in the same sense that \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" is. It's a crying shame that Larsson is no longer around, but the manuscripts he left behind will be his legacy. I rarely get this giddy over anything, but \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is really just that good. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
185459768X|1.0|After reading all the previous reviews, I was very excited to buy the Pullman's trilogy in one book for my son. What I received was a dramatization BASED ON Philip Pullman's trilogy. The cover of the book has two lines on a bottom saying: BASED ON THE NOVELS BY PHILLIP PULLMAN, ADAPTED BY NICHOLAS WRIGHT, which are missing from the image on this page.<br />I am really confused. Are we talking about the same book? Mine looks exactly like the one on the top of this page.

0515141429|1.0|I'll admit that I read this book coming off of reading David Copperfield; however, reading this book was PURE AGONY!  The characters are cardboard, the plot is hackneyed and the violence is gratuitous.  At only one place did the book bacome even moderately human, and even that part was spoiled by the author's twisting it back into the main (thin) plot.  If you believe that this Jack Reacher guy is anything like the stereotype of a John Wayne character, forget it.  Again, the plot is poorly contrived, the characters are cardboard and the writing is terrible.  I would be hard pressed to purchase another Lee Child book!
B000TEUSJK|2.0|This movie isn't the abomination it has often been made out to be. Looking at it now, the film contains many striking images, some beautiful sets, and the performances are overall good. \\"Caligula\\" way-back-when, was a sensation of sorts and I'm totally not interested in that now. Guess it has to do with the sex and the way the movie was publicized? Famous actors and hardcore?! OH MY. I forget. Critics hated it. Anyway, it does feature \\"hardcore\\" explicit sex scenes. But not enough. What *I* thought after seeing this is it doesn't work too well as a great historical drama and nor does it as anything approaching what could be called an \\"adult film\\". \\"Caligula\\" to have been a success as a fine historical drama of the first order would have to have been dramatically re-worked in the pre-production stages I suppose. But if some additional hardcore scenes were added -and some pointless dialog and fluff eliminated- then we'd be talkin' business. It could have been the ultimate adult film of the 1970s, coming out just at the end of that raunchy decade. More scenes like the boat scene and the lady receiving her skin lotion. Well my 2 cents. That's my vision of Caligula. One day perhaps this classic tale will be made and truly deserving a triple X rating. With an older Ron Jeremy in a support role as... never mind.
0440244870|5.0|This was the first book I had read by Sophie Kinsella, and I fell in love instantly! Rebecca Bloomwood is such a funny character, who any woman that loves shopping can really relate to. However, Becky's love of shopping is completely out of control, which gets her into quite a bit of trouble financially. So, Kinsella takes us along on Becky's journey to get her credit card debt and horrible shopping habits under control. Becky is constantly plotting crazy schemes and ironically starts working as a financial advise journalist, and this is just the begining if this wild ride. From there she will continue schemeing and, yes, still shopping, and doing such wild and crazy things you'll have to read to believe. Of course, there will be romance along the way to keep you rooting for Becky each time she digs herself just a little deeper into her hole. This book is so much fun, and after reading it, many years ago, I have purchased, read and loved everything that Kinsella has written since.
B000001ESF|5.0|I agree with another reviewer's assessment here that Michael Ruby's editorial review misses the mark.  In fact, it irritated me to the point that I'm going to go over to CD Universe and order the CD (which I thought of today and realized that after buying the album on 8-track, vinyl, and cassette, I don't currently have it in my CD collection).  So, on to the review:    The first Rush album I ever purchased was \\"All The World's A Stage\\" soon after it came out.  I didn't \\"get\\" it, and it didn't get much play.  A few months later I decided to give Rush a second chance, and I bought \\"2112\\".  Now THAT did the trick.  Geeky, whiny vocalist and nerdy drummer notwithstanding, \\"2112\\"... for a kid growing up in the 70s when it came out, was, and is, simply the definitive prog-rock album of all time.  Wouldn't work if it came out today, but the point is, it didn't come out today.    Now, I'll grant you that just like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and many other greats, Geddy Lee's vocal is an acquired taste... but Neil Peart is an intelligent, literate, most interesting fellow (I've also read all of his books), and gifted lyricist.  Ruby's assessment of him as \\"nerdy\\" simply reflects current anti-intellectual sentiments in our nation... these redneck half-wits who have to defend their own stupidities by criticizing people who do this thing called \\"thinking\\", \\"reading\\", \\"reasoning\\"...    OK, I'm getting worked up now, so I'm off to CD Universe to order \\"2112\\".    --BB
0385737424|5.0|Time travel, especially literary time travel, is the kind of thing that can make your head hurt if you start thinking about it too much. If the time travel in A WRINKLE IN TIME or HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN has you scratching or shaking your head in puzzlement, Rebecca Stead's new novel just might help you figure things out.    Stead gained a reputation for incorporating scientific ideas into entertaining narratives with her debut novel, rebecca LIGHT, about a previously undiscovered society living below the ice in Greenland. She continues exploring mathematical and scientific concepts in her newest work, doing so in clever and often surprising ways.    Miranda knows that she and her mom aren't rich, but they manage to get by in their rundown apartment in their slightly sketchy New York City neighborhood. Miranda's mom, a paralegal who's balking at the thought of moving in with her boyfriend, dreams of fame and fortune on the popular \\"$20,000 Pyramid\\" television show (the year, by the way, is 1979). As for Miranda, she's more worried about just making it through the day without getting harassed by the bullies who haunt the sidewalks between school and home or being accosted by the elderly homeless \\"laughing man\\" who lives on their corner. He chants weird sayings, and he sometimes seems oddly insightful --- or sometimes just plain crazy.    Lately, Miranda has had to navigate this tricky territory --- not to mention the pitfall-laden halls of school itself --- on her own, since her best friend Sal has suddenly decided to act like she doesn't even exist. Why is Sal so distant? Why does the big boy who beat Sal up actually seem gentle, even wise? Can Miranda find happiness with other friends, even if they come from fancier apartment buildings and have more money than she does?    Questions abound, but the biggest mystery of all is who is sending Miranda scarily prophetic notes. These letters mention specific times and places of things that haven't yet happened when Miranda receives them but that, eerily, come to pass exactly as the anonymous writer says they will. Could the answer be hidden in the pages of Miranda's favorite book, which she reads over and over again: A WRINKLE IN TIME by Madeleine L'Engle?    With its explanations and explorations of time travel, WHEN YOU REACH ME does share a great deal with L'Engle's novel. With its focus on a girl learning to independently navigate her Manhattan neighborhood, it also will remind some readers of other classics like HARRIET THE SPY and FROM THE MIXED-UP FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWEILER. And, just as Miranda does with her own favorite novel, the mind-bending conclusion of this one will prompt many readers to flip back to page one and read it all over again, picking up on clues they missed (or didn't understand) the first time around.    With a well-paced plot, engaging characters, strong family portrayals, and a compelling mystery to solve, WHEN YOU REACH ME is a great novel for adults and kids to read together, sharing ideas on what might be happening in Miranda's world and jointly exploring their own theories to explain it all.       --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0385342020|5.0|When I read the synopsis of this book I thought \\"are you kidding - a ghost?\\" but don't be turned off by the somewhat ridiculous sounding plot...this book is great! This was actually my favorite out of all of Sophie Kinsella's books (besides the first 2 Shopaholics). I find the later Shopaholic books to be a little annoying (Becky makes you want to yell at her sometimes!) but the situations in Twenties Girl were laugh out loud funny. This would be a great movie!    The relationship between Lara and Sadie is really cute and I even found my self a bit teary at the end which is odd for a chick lit book, especially a Sophie Kinsella one.     Oh, and I loved the romance with Lara and Ed, too! Overall a very breezy, fun and well written novel.
0061767581|3.0|Most people are familiar with Lauren Conrad from her hit reality TV show \\"Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County\\" and its spinoff, \\"The Hills.\\" Now, having left television, Conrad is trying her hand as a novelist with her teenage fan base in mind. In her semi-autobiographical first novel, L.A. CANDY, Conrad draws on her experiences as a reality TV star to tell the story of Jane Roberts and her best friend, Scarlett, as they discover the pleasures and pitfalls of instant, unexpected fame.    Jane and Scarlett have recently graduated from a posh California high school and decide to strike out on their own in glamorous Los Angeles. Sweet, girl-next-door Jane is interning for a top celebrity event planner, while Scarlett, a knockout as well as an intellectual, plans to attend U.S.C. Drawn to L.A. hoping to inject some excitement into their humdrum, privileged lives, in no time they're shopping, clubbing, making new friends, and starting exciting new relationships. After only a few weeks in town, the pair is suddenly \\"discovered\\" by one of the top producers in Hollywood to star in his new reality series, \\"L.A. Candy.\\" Since they came to the city to shake things up, the girls are only too happy to sign on.    Before they know it, Jane and Scarlett are having every moment of their lives filmed. They are introduced to their co-stars, backstabbing Madison and benign Gaby, who are vying for top billing on the show. It's not long before they begin to feel that their lives are being scripted, their relationships invaded, and that their friends may not be who they thought they were. As Jane emerges as the star of the program, tensions among the girls rise, culminating in a scandal that will change everything.    L.A. CANDY is similar to eating cotton candy --- it lacks substance, but makes for a sinful indulgence. Some readers will wish for more meat from this story and more dimension from Jane, her friends and her enemies. The book has the feeling of just skimming the surface; itis too straightforward to be a truly engrossing read.    Nevertheless, die-hard fans who loved either of Conrad's reality shows will undoubtedly enjoy this novel and will certainly recognize elements of the series as they read. Readers are pulled into the world of reality TV so completely that they will have no trouble visualizing the clubs, fancy restaurants and designer clothes. Conrad's fans will find this a breezy read poolside this summer and will surely look forward to the impending sequel.       --- Reviewed by Meredyth Temple
157912626X|5.0|This is my first Agatha Christie book. I have been informed by many people that I would love Agatha Christie's books. I admit that is true. I started The Body in the Library this morning. Every free moment I had I was reading the book.<br /><br />How would you react to finding a body in your library? I don't know if I would be as calm as the woman in this book. Mrs. Bantry was thrilled with finding a body in her library. This was her chance to be a sleuth. That is what she was eager for.<br /><br />The Body in the Library is a Miss Marple Mystery. Miss Marple is the sleuth in the village of St. Mary Mead. Mrs. Bantry calls Miss Marple up to the house when the body is found.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book except for the parts that were written in French. Since I have never taken French some of the jokes were lost on me. Ms. Christie's writing style is one that is new to me.

0765317389|5.0|In the future, the human race has mastered space travel (but not \\"lightspeed\\").  Before the story in Ender's Game, humans ran into a race known as the Formic, or \\"Buggers\\".  We were able to fight them off, but it was close.  Now we have created the International Fleet (IF), and given them complete control over international and interspace activities.  One of their prime directives is to train the next generation of military leaders at Battle School, a space station orbiting Earth.  Every child in the world is tested as a toddler to determine if they present the kind of traits needed to lead.  The best of the best are taken when they are 5 or 6 and trained to be the next Napoleon or Alexander.<br /><br />Ender's Game follows the story of Andrew Wiggin, known as Ender, as he is selected to attend Battle School.  In some ways, it is similar to Harry Potter in that it is set in a school of exceptional children.<br /><br />This is a book that my father, my mother, my sister and myself have all read, and all thoroughly enjoyed.  Neither my mother nor my sister like \\"sci fi\\" at all, so don't let that put you off.  Once you've read Ender, it will be the kind of book you start buying for others as gifts.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|The highly anticipated and enormously successful sequel to the 2004 blockbuster \\"Batman Begins\\" is very well-made and deserved the Academy Awards it got. However, it unfortunately didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. The movie has so many twists and turns that it will make your head spin. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE. It's really worth buying. SPOILER ALERT! Like \\"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\\" it ends on a cliffhanger, leaving you salivating for a sequel. SPOILER OVER! It SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RATED PG-13. The violence, in my opinion, was mild, given the fact that there was hardly any blood, but intense. It SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATED PG (kids these days have seen far worse). The cast was terrific, especially Heath Ledger as The Joker.

0374264260|4.0|Even though this book was on NPRs \\"recommended\\" list, I was skeptical that I would enjoy it. To be honest, I have no experience with mental illness; any book that was told from the first-person perspective of a mental patient began with a distinct lack of empathy from me.    I was wrong.     In the end, the books that I find most interesting are those that expose me to some corner of humanity that I haven't explored before. The perspective can be alien to me, but what a pleasant thing it is to reach outside the limits of my own experience and discover an honest and real common chord. Such a book is this.    I must admit that I wondered just how Matthew Quick would use a title and a theme about \\"silver linings\\" and not be finally stabbed with the point of his own irony. He eludes his own trap brilliantly.     I will reserve five stars for life-changing books. This isn't that. But, it is truly life-nudging. I recommend it highly.

0765315246|2.0|Glowing reader reviews led me to buy this book.  Having read the book, I now think that those readers who are all aglow probably comprise the core of sci-fi fandom.  For a reader like me, who lurks on the darker more speculative edge of sci-fi, _Old Man's War_ has very little to offer.      The book is driven mainly by military battles, all of which have a comic-book feel to them (ducking explosions, point-and-shoot kills, guttural cries...).  Although there are a few moments of doubt, militarism wins the day.  In the end it's Us vs. Them and the protagonist embraces his new life as a soldier.  Like the characters, war in this novel is flat, predictable, and without moral exploration.       For the right audience, Scalzi's an okay choice.  The pacing is fast, the writing is clear, and the pages turn by the half-minute.  I'm thinking that the ideal reader is male and quite young, perhaps 13-23: someone not bothered by a story which has little more than guns, spaceships, and dead aliens.
0553573411|1.0|I have a large library, in which I collect all manner of scifi and fantasy novels. I only throw away books (not even donating them) that are really bad. The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb is one of them. Just finished the third book and POOF, into the trash they go. (I'd normally resell them to a used bookshop, but I'd consider it cruel and unethical to do so.)<br /><br />What's wrong with this book? Let's count the ways:<br /><br />1) The premise of the book is that the character is trained in the secret ways of magic and assassination. Which is great and all except you get to the end of the third book and about all the assassination the main character has done is feeding poisoned bread to (essentially) zombies and an abortive attempt on the Evil Prince (tm) which doesn't go very well. There's no payoff to the setup.<br /><br />2) Everyone is stupid. Everyone. The king, the evil prince, the main character, everyone. I got to the point where I literally didn't care that the evil prince was doing evil things, because everyone in the world 1) Knew about them and 2) Didn't do anything about it. Until after the fact, at which point it was too late. You wish there was some sort of fictional hand that you could use in the novel to slap them all. The list of stupid things the characters do in the series is long, and tedious.<br /><br />3) The characterization is horrible. Evil Prince(tm) is Evil. Heroic Prince is Heroic. And all of them are stupid. Country under attack? Heroic prince resigns the throne to poke around on a jungle expedition by himself! It's heroic. And stupid.<br /><br />4) The writing is mediocre at best. I've read some of Hobb's other works, and they're not brilliant, but not as bad as this series. Really, with all the wolf-brother stuff in the book, it reads like someone's first attempt at a furry fan fic.<br /><br />It's honestly puzzling why so many people like this series.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Very few 'superhero' comic books have been as intellectually engaging as Watchmen.  Zack Snyder deserves kudos for not only doing a great job of bringing the the graphic novel to life, but also for having the integrity as an artist to do it faithfully to the source material.  Watchmen could easily have been turned into a bastardized simplified movie for main stream audiences (which in all likelihood probably would have made for a bigger blockbuster success, potentially more well-received by the movie-going masses).  I'm glad Snyder had the conviction to make a legitimate Watchmen movie instead.      I hope that over time, the movie will get the appreciation and respect that it rightfully deserves.  Unfortunately, I think that the masses went into the theater expecting nothing more than a great popcorn/action flick.  Most people weren't prepared to pay close attention to a three hour long non-linear multifaceted plot that contemplates some pretty dark moral and philosophical issues.      As much as I enjoyed the movie in the theater, I also felt that some plot points were a bit rushed (despite the long run time) and the film felt disjointed at times.  Thankfully, the added material in this Director's cut does a lot to smooth out these kinks.  For the most part, the added material consists of extended scenes, with more dialogue.      SPOILER AHEAD...    The most significant completely \\"new\\" addition is the death of Hollis Mason, which really should have been kept in the theatrical version.      Although I've heard complaints that 'Tales of the Black Freighter' wasn't spliced into this Director's cut, I really think that the movie is better off without it.  Having already watched the Tales of the Black Freighter dvd, I think they did a great job with it, but its still better as a stand-alone.  It worked great in the context of the graphic novel, but would only be a confusing distraction in a movie that many people were already complaining was too long.  However, I do think it would've been great if 'Black Freighter' and 'Under the Hood' had been included as special features in the package.  Unfortunately they are not.      In summary, Watchmen is a can't-miss film, a brilliant adaptation and IMO, a great and under-appreciated accomplishment.  The Director's Cut includes some excellent added material that significantly enhances the film's continuity.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I left theaters on the opening of \\"The Dark Knight\\" just as excited about what I had seen as everyone else. Some time has passed since then, however, and as I've watched \\"The Dark Knight\\" on DVD it flaws become more and more apparent.<br /><br />Some things I've noted:<br />*The story shares neither the tightness of narrative nor the continuity with the Batman Comics as Batman Begins did.<br />*Christian Bales performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman is dismal. As Bruce Wayne, he's faceless. As Batman, HE SHOUTS EVERYTHING LIKE THIS- fitting for a character that's supposed to quietly sneak around in the middle of the night.<br />*Heath Ledger plays a good Joker, but he's not exceptional. Nor is he the best performance. Gary Oldman's role is most convincing.'<br />*The whole thing is entirely too long, and Dent's treatment at the end is ridiculous. After the halfway point, the entire movie feels incredibly rushed.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" certainly isn't the worst movie around, and it's something you may even enjoy, but that this movie was able to reach number one on whatever all-time list is more a tribute to its obsessed fanbase than its merits. You may want to watch it, and by all means, do. But if you're one of those people who's been able to hold out until now, you're not missing anything by passing this one by.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I'd like to call 'Watchmen: the director's cut' Bluray the Apocalypse Now! of american superhero movies. It is dark, yet poignant, dense, yet full of crackling dramatic scenes. It's probably one of the most striking VISUAL films of the past 10 years. Simply amazing in hi def.<br />Note to parents: I couldn't help worrying that some young kid might accidentally see it and get emotionally scarred from the violence.  There is some near pornographic violence in this film.<br />I understand why there is, too.  This film is trying to push the genre as far as it can in every area, and it does.  For the casual viewer, this might not work. For fans of comics, it's a deeply layered treat.  But like a rich chocolate cake, maybe a bit much to digest in one sitting.<br />If there's one thing that really stood out for this viewer it was the feeling of nostalgia for a 1980s that might've been.  And the music choices were wonderful. Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley are perfection in their parts, and each the opposite pole of the american hero myth.<br />A film to be watched again and again, commented on, argued about for years to come.  Anyone with a Bluray player shouldnt be without this.
B0021L8UMG|5.0|IMHO this film is simply universally great. Thus not made for a target-group. If you need to belong to one, you will find much to dislike. If not, it has a richness beyond your imagination.    The title refers to a remark Lorca makes about the first of what would become the Dali-style paintings. Lorca is incorporated in the picture, and the inspiration for it, so Dali askes him to name his 'breakthrough'. Lorca's anwer,\\"Little Ashes\\", is his melancholic reference to what in the end will remain of their relationship. \\"The painting will still be there\\" Dali objects. Lorca is not convinced but they find each other when Dali proclaims [that the only matter of importance is that]:\\"I can see you now, Frederico\\". Which obviously is meant in the broadest/deepest meaning of the word 'see', and they embrace. At that moment their relationship remains still platonic but becomes a significant step more intimate, maybe uniquely intimate for Dali. The scene is important for many reasons, one of them is the fact that according to most historians Dali was incapable of being touched [man & woman alike]: it may be one of Dali's many made-up stories, but he once stated that he and his lifelong wife Gala were \\"virgins to each other\\" [Gala was famously very not a virgin, so to speak].    The atmosphere of the earlier scene is also in stark contrast with the scene eight years later [1936] when they meet each other again after a long period and Lorca is burdened with the threatening developements in Spain [and sadly not his own safety: Lorca was murdered by the fascists in '36] while Dali has become a money-loving poseur who almost advertises the concept of a world-war \\"that will eliminate the weaker elements everywhere, a great cleansing\\". They are worlds apart now.     Both scenes and the ones in between are brilliantly acted by Javier Beltran, who as Lorca radiates inner beauty and unworldly amounts of charm that make brickbuilded straight truckdrivers cry when he dies, while Robert Pattinson is amazing in his portrayal of the totally transforming Dali: Pattinson leaves you, as a spectator, completely in the dark where it all comes from, it seems like he managed to convince Dali's ghost to make a great come-back via him.     Matthew McNulty as a very macho homophobic Luis Bunuel is entirely convincing too, especially when he, as a result of reading Lorca's diary, is appalled because of it's content but at the same time doubts his independent mind, being not able to understand his friend. Thus he storms straight from the diary to a gay meeting place where he violently fails to achieve any 'progress'. In the end however his feelings of friendship for Lorca prevail, though he never will be capable to mention the subject. Which is kind of endearing when he franticly warns his friend not to go to a fascist dominated area of Spain because of Lorca's political convictions and the fact that \\"they know.....everything!\\"   These will be the last words Lorca will hear from his friend.    More than enough said: this film is simply too good to put into words.    [I DO hope however that if/when released the American DVD will get another cover since the region 2 version is a 'Do Not Buy' add.]
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|...though it's easy to understand the predicament of \\"Watchmen.\\" For most movie-goers, the ultra-serious trailer that appeared before \\"The Dark Knight\\" was a first exposure. The commercials that soon hit airwaves weren't much different. What the advertising for \\"Watchmen\\" wasn't able to do was explain to people that, unlike \\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Watchmen\\" is VERY much a comic book movie, and a parody of one at that. Understandably, many viewers left theaters that night scratching their heads, wondering what exactly it was they'd just spent the last three hours sitting through.<br /><br />Snyder executes Moore's work almost flawlessly. Aside from the ending (which, BTW, is better than the comic book's disappointing one), \\"Watchmen\\" easily stands as one of the most accurately depicted comic book movies ever. The few omissions leave some viewers out in the cold- but Snyder is a genius at putting emphasis where it counts. A video that plays in the beginning under Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A'Changing\\" serves as both a credit roll and a history lesson for those not already familiar with the story's alternate setting. Snyder has also put Moore's political themes at the forefront: there's more Nixon scenes, as some well as some humorous and speculative cameos from the likes of Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro, and Pat Buchanan.<br /><br />And yet, the film is almost too short- even three hour long director's cut. As the scenes of the film progresses faithfully to the chapters of the book, with the storytelling focusing on one or maybe two characters at a time and their paths intertwining closer to the end, one gets the impression that Watchmen would have done much better as an eleven or twelve episode mini-series. But then, we wouldn't have the high-budget special effects and choreography that we do now, and those are two aspects of the movie that are worth noting because they're definitely top-notch.<br /><br />The liberal intellegensia hate this movie, as their press has made quite clear, but that's because they haven't done their homework. Like so many viewers, critics have not been able to pinpoint its place as a parody. Viewers who expect Watchmen is some super series courtroom drama with masked adventurers playing polarized symbolizations of things like 'law and order' or 'chaos'- that is, people who expect they're getting something like \\"The Dark Knight\\"- should approach the movie with more of an open mind. Those who accept it for what it is- a politically fueled dark comic book 'parody' with plenty of serious points as well as laughs- will like the film quite a bit more.at's because they haven't done their homework.

0765348276|2.0|I'm a huge SF fan, but disliked this book.  I think some of the 3-star reviewers critiqued the plot better than I can, or feel like reinventing.  I'll speak more generally, then leave off with a very specific example.    I've found you have to be careful when assessing the reviews of any item that has a mass following, especially if it has won a prominent award, as this one has.  This book has a HUGE amount of reviews, overwhelmingly positive.  But retarded people are quick to hit the 5-star button (or 1-star) when they're swept up with what they're supposed to believe, and mildly pleased.  A fan-base seems to have a critical mass:  once you're sufficiently popular, you can sky-rocket despite shortcomings.  That's what I think happened here.  So apologies to the author or devoted fans for my harsh words, maybe the guy's got great potential stories.    I wouldn't dog this so bad if it weren't made out to be more than a sophomoric effort, which I think is what this is.  So no offense to the author, it's better than I can do, and I think he's got a future.  But the slavering devotion to this book makes me slightly ill.    So:  in regard to the bad dialogue, which makes up roughly half of the words overall in the book, I'd like to quote a section to give you an idea of how trite, hollow, retarded it is.  It sounds like a screenplay for the show Friends in space at war with aliens.      This is a particularly bad section I chose, but I insist that the book is filled with passages like this.  If you don't believe me, then please use the \\"Look Inside!\\" feature and go read some random sections.  Read any 3 page section and then extrapolate.    Usually a dialogue-heavy book can serve to build up the characters, but for me the character development was shockingly shallow.  I knew and cared only about the narrator throughout the entire book.     The book had some solid sections, and I actually liked the voice of the narrator.  But I think the author had it in his head when starting out that he was going to \\"make it accessible to everyone!! LOL\\"   And thus he devotes half of the book to dialogue, and a token character to explain each plot device, and shies away from anything that might challenge a reader with a 90 IQ.  If he'd written this current day, I guarantee the characters would be twittering each other.    Maybe he wrote a good first draft and the publisher made him make it accessible to the idiots.  Maybe they said, \\"Please remove these two-thirds of 'military jargon' and 'science stuff' and 'internal reflections' and 'moral quandaries' and replace it with campy TV-style dialogue, then we'll publish.  Watch this CBS sitcom and learn how to make money.\\"    (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to quote the book at the length below, but here goes):    -------    \\"What the hell sort of army is this, anyway?\\" I asked the Old Farts at lunch.  \\"It makes a little bit of sense,\\" Harry said.  \\"Yesterday we did basic intellect and emotion.  Today was basic physical movement.  Again, they seem interested in the foundations of high order activity.\\"  \\"I'm not really aware of Ping-Pong being indicative of higher order physical activity,\\" I said.  \\"Hand-eye coordination,\\" Harry said.  \\"Timing.  Precision.\\"  \\"And you never know when you're going to have to bat back a grenade,\\" Alan piped in.  \\"Exactly,\\" Harry said.  \\"Also, what do you want them to do?  Have us run a marathon?  We'd all drop before the end of the first mile.\\"  \\"Speak for yourself, flabby,\\" Thomas said.  \\"I stand corrected,\\" Harry said.  \\"Our friend Thomas would make it to mile six before his heart imploded.  If he didn't get a food-related cramp first.\\"  \\"Don't be silly,\\" Thomas said.  \\"Everyone knows you need to power up with carbs before a race.  Which is why I'm going back for more fettucine.\\"  \\"You're not running a marathon, Thomas,\\" Susan said.

Its amazing to me how authors can write crap like \\"you just need to put money in your assets column\\".

I also don't subscribe to this authors implication that money solves lifes problems.  It doesn't.

B0020TS5JM|5.0|This movie offers the great mix of good acting and action well done. The story holds together well and the characters are believeable.  The action scenes are well done with not too much CGI.  The forest and scenes look real.  Well worth watching.
B000002NJS|4.0|Madonna has been around for almost three decades which is hard to believe. I remember when she first came on the music scene with Borderline and the rest is musical history. With the recent and sudden passing of Michael Jackson, Madonna even paid homage during one of her concerts to his memory which I thought it was touching.    Madonna's Ray of Light is above average but not excellent but she keeps trying and recording. Her songs here are fine but not groundbreaking anymore. She has broken a lot ground during her career and there is not much left. As a mother and wife, Madonna has matured and so has her musical inclinations. She is a solid performer and can dance as well as sing a tune. The collection of songs here are mixed and no two are really alike.
1416595546|5.0|This is a powerful novel that spans the 20th century, starting in Russia just before the Communists took power and ending just after the fall of communism.<br /><br />The main character is Sashenka, the daughter of wealthy nouveau riche.  This is the story of her embrace of communism in 1916, and what follows.  We are then carried to her life in 1939, and finally, in the early 1990s we discover the fate of all the main characters.<br /><br />It's no spoiler to say that Stalin was a dreadful, truly scary man that led Russia down some twisted paths.<br /><br />This is just a wonderfully written book, and I truly cared about the fates of every single character.  I loved the way the author structured the story, with flashbacks and slowly unfolding information.<br /><br />I just loved this book.  I started reading it around 6pm and just fnished. It is now 1am, and it is a work night!  But I couldn't put it down!
031606792X|2.0|After reading the first 3 books and falling in love with the series, the 4th installation could have been a lot better. I recently became a Twilight fan after seeing the movie first(I'm a sucker for love stories). It prompted me to read the series, which I read over the span of one wk. So no I am not one of those people who had some preconceived notion of how the book was supposed to end. I was merely following along with the series until I got to BD.   1. First of all, what happened to the Bella and Edward love story?? There was a wedding, honeymoon, pregnancy, vampire, lots of stuff in the middle that I'll get to, then a battle. There was no passion in their relationship after the honeymoon. I truly missed that. What happened Stephenie?  2.Some things were not believable and didn't make sense. I'm not talking about the pregnancy. After all, it is a story about vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters. If you are reading about these mythical creatures then just go along with the far fetched pregnancy - it's not that serious people. I'm talking about Charlie's need to know attitude. It just wasnt' believable to me. And what happened to Renee, her mother. There was no explanation for her disapperance.   3. Happily ever after. I liked the happily ever after. I think Bella suffered enough in New Moon. She almost died in childbirth - give the girl a break. But like I said, Charlie's acceptance was just not believable. Meyer's could have been more creative and maybe have Charlie kidnapped by the Volturi and forced to find out about vampires - that would have been a believable way for him to stay in Bella's life. Which is why the review is titled \\"could have been better.\\"  4. Pregnancy storyline. I didn't mind the pregnancy storyline. It is Meyer's work. If she wants to write about Bella and Edward having a child, let her.  I think the direction she took the storyline was not good. First of all, why does Edward have so few if any scenes with his own child? She used the pregnancy to wrap up loose ends without having to be creative. \\"Could have been better.\\" As a reader, I did not develop any connection to Renesmee. I really didn't see her connect to her parents. Seems like she was created so Jacob could have someone to imprint on. She matures in 7 years, she spends most of her time with Jacob or Rosalie.     That whole situation was just weird. I know a lot of people have commented on the imprint thing. For me, I'd best describe it as distasteful. Technically I would not refer to it as pedophilia b/c there was no sexual or romantic interest on Jacob's part. I found it disturbing that a nearly grown man/potential suitor would constantly hang around this child until said child \\"becomes of age.\\" To each his own, that just made me uncomfortable. I was uncomfortable  when Quil imprinted on Claire and he had to be around her constantly. I do not find anything supernatural about that aspect of it, which definitely borders on perversion . Secondly, wasn't Jacob in love with Bella, Renesmee's mother? He didn't get the girl in the book, but he might end up with her daughter? If that's not an episode from the Jerry Springer Show, then I don't know what is.  5. Characters could have been expanded on. I would love to have seen Bella's relationship with the Cullens develop more - since they were all family. Did Rosalie develop any real feelings for Bella or was she only interested in the baby? We'll never know. What happened to Leah? What happened to her friends - Angela, Jessica, Mike??  6. The Battle. I'm happy no one got killed. Considering Bella's power as a shield I think the Cullens might have won. I would have loved it if Bella kicked Jane's _ss. \\"could have been better.\\"    Overall it was a good read. I couldn't put the book down. Biggest problem - Meyers should have been more creative.
B001I82RVS|2.0|Some movies are in black and white, some are in color, but this movie was practically 98% RED!  Even in the seventies, some of that Japanese bloodbath cinema was pretty over-the-top and intense.  Those writers over there in Japan: do they have personal problems?  Does sick people in death-row prisons write this stuff?  This world is getting pretty scary if this is what entertains people.
B00004WKII|3.0|If you're looking for a comprehensive collection of Hendrix recordings, you'll just have to keep waiting cause this isn't it.  While the fidelity of the recordings has never sounded better, (including some much improved remixes) calling this a box set is somewhat deceiving.  Hendrix released three studio albums and one live recording while alive, and several of the highlights of those recordings are not here.  There's no Castles Made of Sand, Manic Depression, Love or Confusion, May This Be Love, Crosstown Traffic, Remember, etc.  That being said, there is some stuff here for a Hendrix collector that is dying to have some new/slightly different material to add to their collection.
0385341008|5.0|I was loaned this book by a friend and kept picking it up and putting it down.  I didn't think a book comprised totally of letters would hold my interest.  I finally cracked it open and started reading and I am so glad I did.  It has rocketed to the top 3 books I've ever read.  I love the wit and humor sprinkled througout the wonderful character development.  I always know I've read something extraordinary when I am coming to the end of the book and feel I'm going to miss the characters I feel I've come to know.  Don't let the letter format turn you off.  It is an awesome read!
0756405890|5.0|The last fantasy series I loved (and still do) was George R Martins Fire and Ice.  That said, this book was such a stupendously wonderful surprise.  I could not put it down, fast paced without sacrificing anything. Likable, believable characters and even more rare in fantasy books: likable female characters!  Intriguing plot line building carefully with clear direction. I highly recommend this book to the picky fantasy nerd :)
0441017177|5.0|All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  This is hard sci-fi at its best.  Edgy technology combined with very human stories of mortality, immortality, guilt and redemption.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I love this DVD so much that I can´t say how many times I´ve watched this... There is no more to say...  In the moment I almost can´t wait for the blu ray of this DVD. This would be just the paradise for me. So, please, if someone knows something about this blu ray launch,let me know when I would bougth!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really good DVD. You will sweat.  It's great if you are short on time, the workout is divided into 3 27 minute sections.  Jillian is very motivating.   You will not be bored or disappointed.
0739380338|5.0|I was hooked on Rick Riordan's books from word one and have been reading them ever since.  The final battle between the Olympians and the Titans was very gripping, in fact the entire book was soon good that I just couldn't put it down and I was so anxious to start reading it that while I was waiting for my audio version I purchased the Kindle version and read the first three chapters!  I just hope that Mr. Riordan does decide to keep his promise that he made in the video interview that he gave (which was/is available here on Amazon.com) and writes another similar series soon!!
B0002UOK04|5.0|Every single song on this album is AWESOME.  Now that can only be said for maybe a dozen albums (ie.  Master of Puppets, Beneath the Remains, Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, Aspera Hiems Symfonia...)      Just listen to the song Winter Madness and once you get past the fact that it's got great guitars, vocals, lyrics, drumming and a sick solo, you'll just realize that it's actually a classical music expressed through metal.  It's an inspiring work of art that was envisioned and performed by one man with the help of an awesome session drummer Kai.    Every track is completely different and varies in length and speed. This is literally the only CD I've listened to for 3 months.  One song will not give you a headache, the whole album can be enjoyed straight through and through with lots to explore because of it is such a fresh sound.    Wintersun will appeal to your intelligent, creative side and not disillusion or rot your mind like other death metal bands such as CC...    Favorite Finnish Bands/Songs  Wintersun - The Whole Album  COB - Hatecrew Deathroll, Are you dead yet  Norther - Drowning, Unleash Hell, Mirror of Madness  Mors Principum Est - Another Creation  Ensiferum - Iron    BTW Bout the cover art, Necro Lord is pure genius!!!
B001FB55H6|1.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed other \\"superhero\\" movies like the first two xmen, the second and third spiderman, and the dark knight, and being mildy amused by the third xmen and first spiderman, I'd have to say this movie was an utter disappointment.  Unoriginal, predictable characters that you can't even love to hate, minimal action, and an utterly depressing plot (if you can call it a plot)that drags on and on and on and on... this movie stinks on so many levels.  Even MST3K wouldn't have been able to do anything with this stinkeroo!  If 2 1/2 hours of complete torture is what you desire, then I completely recommend this movie.  Otherwise run... don't walk... run away and pick up ANYTHING else! Even the Fantastic Four outshines this one!
0380778556|1.0|I read this book as an assignment for an English class, but I appear to have missed the \\"Classic, romantic and suspenseful\\" elements in it that so many other reviewers talk about. I couldn't find the romance in Maxim taking the main character for several car rides, where she did all the talking, before he proposed to her. After being married, Maxim grows distant and the main character grows incredibly paranoid that she doesn't measure up to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca. Not that she actually does anything about it. No, instead of confiding in someone, getting over it, or even talking to her husband, she goes on moping around for months.<br />I found the main character spineless and annoying, the story in need of some editing (300+ pages, most of them of the main character worrying and complaining, is far too much for my taste,)  and the ending pretty anti-climatic.<br />I also had a hard time believing Maxim felt guilty about his crimes. Which is probably not good, given that the main character decides to over look them. She's just so relieved that he wasn't still in love with Rebecca.<br />Perhaps I missed the point. (Whether it was to sympathize with the main character, or the whole story was about hate... I've yet to find an explanation that makes me want to explore the story more, and honestly, I don't think I'd want to have anything to do with it again.)
B000066744|3.0|The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because the music, its very good. Ennio Morricone composes another masterpiece! This is a surface level film, looks good but nothing happening underneath. Its almost like the movie was a vehicle for the terrific music. Makes we wonder if the music came 1st...<br /><br />Besides the music the characters are weak and have little depth. Why is it the supporting actor, a trumpet playing best friend, despite being about the same age as 1900 (24) acts like some wise sage when lecturing to him at times?? Also the supporting actor's acting is a bit...transparent... His character if given more screen time would of been really annoying. The plot is simple, but thats fine, most of the best movies have a simple plot. Some people are upset by the ending, but it works and makes sense to me. I suppose I must mention the racial angle which also angered some viewers. I to rolled my eyes when he defeats Jelly-Roll, who I seriously doubt was so extravagant and wealthy due to his exploitation by the white music business owner's system. I also doubt they would let him enter and leave using the main ship exit. Such neglect of historical fact and accuracy is slightly insulting.<br /><br />In closing, if I were to ever watch this movie again it would be for the music, which makes me think seriously of going ahead and buying the soundtrack now to spare myself of the trite film.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Admittedly, Hugh Jackman is really sexy in a beard, but that wasn't enough to hold a 165-minute film together. (Mostly because Nicole Kidman is about as sexy as a Mouskateer. It takes two to tango.) The plot was so relentlessly predictable, I spent most of the movie groaning in pain. (The neighbors called to ask if I needed a doctor.) Add over-acting, under-acting, bad writing, melodramatic death scenes that were so overdone they seemed like spoofs, plot holes the size of Kansas and, in spite of supposedly being about Australia, very little genuine feel for the country, and you've got another sure-fire Academy Award.
B0026UV77C|1.0|i used to love placebo. though honestly, i feel their music through the ages has gotten nothing but less and less mature. they've reached infancy with this album. don't even bother yourself. not one listen-able song.. if you don't have it, pick up their self-titled album instead.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started doing 30 day shred in March 2009. This first week I thought I was going to DIE!! I stuck with level one for about a month. I finally got to where I could do it without taking a break and moved on to level 2. Again, I thought I was going to die. By the way, I always take a water break between each section, that is what the pause button is for. I was so sore I could hardly walk. My knees hurt for a month also, but they don't bother me at all anymore. I stuck with it everyday no matter how late it was. I have even done it at midnight. After 2 months I had lost 13 lbs. Also, I was eating sensibly by cutting back on fat intake and sugar intake. I quit eating before I got too full and never drank sodas. Now, 4 months later I have lost 24 lbs, 6 in. in my waist, 3 in in my chest and 3 in. off my hips. I have gone from busting out of a size 10 to comfortably wearing a size 4. I never measured my arms or legs, but they are way smaller and my arms are starting to show cuts where muscles are forming. I feel like I am in my 20's again. I am at the weight I was in my 20's. (I am 39 now.)I also added other biggest loser workouts like power sculpt and cardio max and Jillian's new ones Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No MOre Trouble Zones. Those are really hard and consist of 7 circuits. They are so awesome though. I alternate all of these now and hope to lose a few more pounds and keep my cholesterol down. All of this started in an effort to lower my cholesterol and I ended up getting my old body back, but even better due to muscle tone. Thanks Jillian!!!!You gave me my health and energy back.  I feel great!!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This Movie is groundbreaking. I Love the comic and have ever seance i found it then the movie came out and , its just amazing. The depth of emotion the conections that you form to each hero or villan. It means so much more when you can conect with a character and project yourself into the story, and now, into the movie. AMAZING! yes some elements are diffrent from the comic to the movie but hey, why do you want the exact same thing? This is #1 on my comic to movie list.  Acualy I bleave its #1 on my movie list period!  Read the comic, watch the movie, read the comic as you watch the movie.  Its fun its beautiful and It Can quite possibaly change your out look on a great manythings.    Masterpeice.
B000O1799U|5.0|Movie musicals gained new notoriety with the release of \\"Chicago\\" a few years back, so it was only natural that a studio was going to finally release the film version of \\"Dreamgirls\\". I say finally because ever since \\"Dreamgirls\\" debut on Broadway in 1981, starring Jennifer Holiday, there has been talk that this fine show would make it to the big screen. In 2006 \\"Dreamgirls\\" premiered at the boxoffice to audience and critical acclaim.<br /> I first saw most of the cast of \\"Dreamgirls\\" when they promoted the film on \\"Oprah\\" and I knew it was going to be a huge hit. Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx star in this film based on the lives of 1960's girl group The Supremes. However, it is Jennifer Hudson's searing performance of Ellfie that steals the film with Oprah telling her that watching Hudson's performance is like \\"a religious experience\\".  She plays the role based on the life of Florence ballard, the Supreme who became an alcoholic and died broke. Beyonce is also great in the Diana Ross role. Everything from the beautiful music to the costumes is excellent, and you do not have to be a fan of Broadway musicals to enjoy this film. \\"Dreamgirls\\" is an entertaining movie for everyone who has ever had a dream of making it big in show business. Jennifer Hudson would reach superstardom by winning that years Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the film.<br /> This 2 disc set comes with a slew of bonuses, the best being a two hour documentary on how \\"Dreamgirls\\" was developed from Broadway to film.<br /> \\"Dreamgirls\\" has so far made over 154 million dollars worldwide.
B00260HH3K|5.0|Dragonball fans are like the Hulk fans who got mad because in the movie they used CGI, so they complained that all hulk was, was pixels on a computer.  You people need some serious help.  Watch the damn movie, have fun and quit whinning like some little girls.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book is all I have to say. Very funny and easy read, you feel like you are there with her. Great author, can't wait to see the DVD which just came out. I also recommend reading Devil Wears Prada in case you haven't read it. It's just as good. I couldn't put it down.
B0013ND36G|5.0|Where would Terminator be without Arnold? Well, we've seen what Christian Bale can do but Terminator live up to their name is this saga. On of the best if not the best Terminators. These movies will last for a life time and you will always wonder \\"what if?\\". What if we could go to the future!
B00164KYV4|4.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" uses comedy to paint a chilling commentary about contemporary relationships.  Plato said in \\"The Republic,\\"  \\"A society that chooses freedom over justice leads to chaos\\" (paraphrase). In \\"He's Just Not That Into You,\\" Plato's prescient words come alive!  Each character is motivated by selfish motives in a real life game of \\"Twister.\\" While, the movie has a \\"happily ever after\\" ending to it, it let's human nature off the hook for better ratings. Of course, no one wants to happily leave the movie feeling everyone lost, because they overreached their boundaries.  At the movie's end, society and the social environment hasn't changed, but we're left to feel good that the characters triumphed, because they all had an epiphany.     Once, I'd like to see a movie where the characters self-destruct due to greed and selfishness.  The ride home between couples would be contemplative.     All-in-All, This is a good movie for both males and females to see a \\"mirror\\" of ourselves.    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute  [...]
B000EDWKXS|4.0|I was suprised by how subtle some of the extended footage was and some of it being not so subtle. The footage certainly adds depth to the storyline, the relationship between Poe and Baby-O and why poe made the choices he did other than \\"just\\" being a Ranger. While the extended and unrated footage isn't to the extent of say Aliens or Terminator 2 it amazes me how 7 additional minutes can add so much to an already great film.<br /><br />The bottom line is you've probably seen the movie many times and are wondering if an unrated and extended edition is worth buying the movie again or maybe you don't own it and are asking why not just buy the theatrical version? It seemed to me being unrated it was a bit more graphic, a bit more blood, a bit more violent,and there are many, many more f-boms thrown in including a new great one liner between Cameron Poe and Johnny 23. This is the definitive version of the film.<br /><br />This is the throw everyting including the kitchen sink edition. The widescreen looks good and clear, the sound is crisp it's an enjoyable film with a great cast, a movie you'd expect to hit theaters with all the other Summer Blockbusters.  So some of the extended and unrated footage works, some works really well and some falls flat, some could have stayed out of the movie but for the most part it adds to the enjoyment of the movie. For instance some thing that may not have been on screen you just assumed or figured out for yourself and now it's right there for you to see and hear.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Coraline is the story of a young girl named Coraline Jones who movies with her family into a new house, initally bored in the house, and with her parents who normally pay her no mind, Coraline sets off to explore the house in which she finds a door to another version of her house with another moter and father who seem to be better than her current parents, but apperances can be deciving. Coraline is directed by Henry Selick, who also directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, so it does have the same visual style as that movie, but it works for this movie, and look fantastic. With the visuals aside, rather quickly, we come to the story, which is were the heart is, the story is very well written and, thatnks to the voice actors of the characters, keeps you interested in where the film is taking the characters. Some younger kids may find it a bit creepy, but when i saw it, no child made a big fuss about it, and it's very enjoyable by kids and adults alike(i personally loved this movie, and i'm a 21 year old gamer who's more into bloody action movies like Rambo). If you pick up the 2 disk collectors edition, you not only get the movie, but you get the 3D version with 4 pairs of 3D glasses, and a second disk loaded with nice extras(and a tote bag if you get it at FYE). In all, Coraline is a movie with heart, it's delightfully creepy, and is a great family film for everyone.
B001FB55H6|5.0|My family got this movie yesterday, and I have to say, this isn't a movie you want to show your underage comic fan. I'm not saying that cause it didn't stay true to the ending; I'm saying this that like the title says, this is the shot in the arm that the superhero genre needs in the film industry.<br /><br />I really like this extended cut of this film. I didn't get to see this in theaters , but I can tell when a movie had added scenes. AS a fan of comics and animation, the Watchmen graphic novel really set the standard in graphic storytelling, and like the book counterpart, this is what superhero movies should be. I know there are a lot of this film that didn't stay true to Alan Moore's vision, but I think that this is a great movie to watch.
0812548094|4.0|I have to say, I'm not a fast reader, so when I get a book like this, I'm investing weeks in it.  The book was satisfying.  I am enjoying Zedd, Kahlan and Richard, and this book really developed them.  The length of the book was a little problamatic, first because I felt like there was a lot lot lot of talking, and I felt the resolution was rushed.  If there can be anything rushed in a 979 page book.  Everything was resolved really quickly.  I felt that Goodkind looked at the length of his book and thought, \\"Gosh!  I have to hurry up!\\"  That is what took the fifth star off my review.  spoilers  I also tire from plot frustration. Where characters just miss each other, or the one thing that would clear up the confusion of the plot is just out of  reach.  Why tell the reader that Zedd just misses a meet up with Kahlan? It just frustrates the reader. Chase only appearing just as Richard is going into the storm? I also was a little annoyed that Richard and Kahlan spent so much time with the Mud people at the beginning of the book.  If they had immediately left for Aydandril at the first opportunity, the whole Sisters part would have been missed. Obviously that was integral to the plot, but if it was so important to close the veil, I think Richard and Kahlan would have left immediately.   And why have all the drama about Richard putting on the collar again? Yes he hates it. But when K told him to put it on, she could have explained herself way better and put Richard's mind at ease.  Just a couple of things like this where characters could have acted slightly differently (and in my opinion, more in character) and it would have solved a whole lot of problems.  This was a fun book, with a few plot problems, but I really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to book 3...but I think I'll wait a few months.
B00164GDD2|5.0|To me this is the perfect movie for everyone to see. Unlike a lot of movies now a days that rely on disgusting toilet and sex humor, out-dated pop culture references and a lot of unnecessary violence, this movie fits the taste of anyone who watches it. It's a romantic comedy, it's a supernatural thriller mystery, it's a paranormal action movie, it's all sorts of great movie Genres all rolled into one movie!<br /><br />I highly recommend Ghostbusters!
B001AQO3WY|1.0|This series is just god-awful.  The producers or screenwriters fall into the comfortable military stereotypes where they think being in the military is like being at boot camp.  They make the finest fighting force in the world look like bumbling idiots because this is Hollywood's chance to make their anti-war/anti-Bush statement.    It's really too bad because the book and Rolling Stone article were very good.  Nothing like this pile of garbage.  I can't believe Evan Wright signed off on this crap.  He must have been paid a lot of money to make buffoons of the men he was embedded with in Iraq.    I am a Marine.  I don't believe any REAL Marine infantryman would say there is any validity to this series.  If you want realism, check out \\"Blood Stripes\\" or \\"Street Fight in Iraq.\\"  Both EXCELLENT books.  Not movies.  Hollyweird will never make a movie which depicts Marines in a positive light.  Not in this millenium, anyway.    Semper Fi
0061122416|5.0|Several readers have posted their opinions concerning the emphasis on faith and omens serving as the primary guide to reaching one's personal legend.  Some have said that the plot is too far fetched, and it negates the use of reason as a way of reaching one's destiny.  However, I disagree.      I do not believe that the primary message of Santiago's journey is to prove that faith and omens alone are the key to one's personal success.  Reason, intellect, and realism are all good, but the story illustrates that there are two sides to every coin. His adventure merely acknowledges that there is another option to the journey towards destiny outside of realism.  Santiago's faith in signs and omens serve as HIS way of reaching his personal legend; and he accomplished his task by understanding the true essence of himself.  This story was not meant to inspire readers to put all their eggs in the basket of faith.  Instead, it urges readers to understand their inner self and how they can personally reach their destiny, whether it's through faith and signs, reason, or a mixture of both.
B001HXOO88|5.0|After hearing an excerpt from Dreams from My Father on PBS, I decided to read the book.  Since Crown first published the book in 1995, I thought that the book would give me an honest look at President Barack Obama. I think I was right, if you want understand what motives the President read Dreams from My Father.  In the book he talks about his absence father and how that shaped his personality.  Yet, all of the challenges he faced helped prepare him for the long journey to the White House.  Moreover, the greatest lesson he learned in life that he tries to convey to America and world is, \\"It's not about you.\\"
1572814349|5.0|Have the Universal Waite Tarot Deck and the Deviant Moon Tarot. and the Golden tarot deck looks much better than both of them. colorful and it looks similar to the standard tarot card but you feel that it`s new improved version,, not like the waite tarot cards as it looks very old and poor drawing.   the box it comes with is also nice looking and you can put the cards in it after using it. the golden borders of the cards is a nice touch.  it`s the best whether for new learners or old ones.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen! Anyone into animation (like moi) will absolutely LOVE it! The fact that they made this using stop-animation techniques is pretty awesome; I mean look what they were able to do. if you are a fan of The nightmare before Christmas or Pixar films, any animation, you will find this unique and enticing. The story is great, the art is wonderful, and even the music is creepily delightful! The acting is not so bad either. A must-see!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this series, and I am hard to please when it comes to vampire movies, (I am somewhat of a connoisseur). Not cheesy at all, the right amount of drama to make it intriguing without getting hoky.    I can't wait to own the next season.
B0028K31CE|5.0|when you put out 3 cds that were so good, you set your fans up for sooo much to expect.. and given maxwell took an 8 year hiatus, makes that expectation hit unreachable heights... soo...  take it as it is...  maxwell after 8 years... its great. its soo good to my ears i cantstopplayinthis cd. this cd has so much flava, his style is just as strong as it was on the first 3..
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Regarding Two suns (I've not heard Ms. Kahn's first album yet)-<br />Inevitable comparisons must surface... Enya, & to some degree, Lorenna McKinnet, or Moire Brennan, but Ms. Kahn is not \\"straight-jacketed\\" by her approach; not settled into a single \\"sound\\", yet there IS a Ms. Khan \\"sound\\"... It's just not placed in your lap on a platter as the other two ladies I mentioned do ( & don't get me wrong, I love both Enya, & Ms. McKinnet's work)- it's just that you might have to \\"work\\" a trifle, delve into her washes of sound to discern her \\"sound'.<br />Difficult? Not at all!<br />Fun? Indeed!<br />Worth your time & money?<br />I vote YES!
B001VZY4M8|5.0|I did two sets of A-B comparisons of the original CD issues to the recent reissues for these albums (NY, Goldrush, Nowhere and Harvest).  One was on my mp3 player (FLAC) and the other on my home stereo.    Like with many recent reissues the volume is increased (only slightly, thank goodness) and the bass is beefed up (punchier, more delineated, less of a blob sound).  Unlike with many recent reissues (the Stones come to mind), distortion is not introduced with these changes.    On the electric numbers I frankly did not hear much difference.  It may say more about how well the original CDs were mastered (which I had always thought were just fine).  The differences really shine with the acoustic numbers, especially on Harvest.    Good upgrade for us fanatic Neil fans, but many won't hear much of a difference.

1897299214|5.0|Although the scope of this book is obviously limited due to the author's own sphere of experience in North Korea, the minimalist drawings and humorous anecdotes bring to life the experience of visiting this communist nation. The humor is a welcome respite in the midst of a story of a nation shrouded in great fear, lack and paranoia.<br /><br />I think that the author's minimalist drawing style is great and really allow the images to take front and center. I enjoy the intermittent full-page drawings of the people, places and things Mr. Delisle sees... He doesn't wax introspective to a degree that is distracting. He seems to care about the North Korean people that he meets/works with (and the \\"volunteers\\" he sees throughout his trip) although he must struggle with the language, cultural and political barriers that separate them. Overall, I really see an honest account coming through the drawings and dialogue and found myself completely wrapped up in the story.<br /><br />He has a very special account of how he and his official guide and driver spent an afternoon near a stream/river just doing whatever...smoking, enjoying the stream or taking a nap. An ode to the freedom to do and be in the moment...a feeling that most in the \\"Western-world\\" do not understand the absence of, yet is a near every-moment reality for those living in totalitarian regimes all around the world.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for High-School students, history students and current-events watchers as it gives a fresh and personal perspective on a nation with an volatile history, intense current issues and a future no doubt to be in the international spotlight for better or worse...for the sake of the people of North Korea here is hoping it is for the better...
B00164GDD2|4.0|If you liked Ghost Busters as I did then you might enjoy the film that may have been it's inspiration.  The film is from the 1950's and is called Ghost Breakers starring Bob Hope.   Amazing how many films popular in our times seem to spring from earlier works.  Enjoy!  $crooge
0061537969|3.0|I enjoyed the premise of this book being told from the dog's point of view, but I didn't like that so much of the book's story centered on events the dog could not be present for. When he was focused on the dog's view of human nature and behavior, the author had some truly fascinating insights. However, I thought the racing metaphors were overused. Overall, I enjoyed moments of this book but it didn't come together as a story for me.
B001E75QH0|4.0|I loved the Indy films except for the second one.  Any way want to see where all this genius may have come from then perhaps you need to look beyond Spielberg.  If you're a fan as I am then if possible take a look at the 1954 film called \\"Secret of the Incas\\" starring none other than Charlton Heston.  You may find yourself thinking, man even Indy isn't an original cause Chuck did it before Harrison.  You're sure to enjoy.  $crooge
B000TEUCFA|4.0|Stacey Kent has a soft, understated voice that seems to glide along with her accompanying music.<br /><br />On \\"Breakfast on The Morning Tram,\\" Ms. Kent pleasantly surveys the landscape. Singing songs like \\"Ice Hotel,\\" \\"Breakfast on the Morning Tram,\\" \\"Never Let Me Go,\\" and \\"So Romantic\\" will definitely put the listerner in a romantic mood.<br /><br />This is a sweet, pleasant record. It doesn't seem to be trying to be anything more, and fortunately, it is also nothing less.
031606792X|1.0|I just finished Breaking Dawn. I had read several of the poor reviews that helped prepare me for a very pathetic conclusion. Twilight held some promise, but the series declined from there...    To me, the only real appeal was the tension between Bella and Edward; however, too many things added up to kill my buzz:    Bella - whiney, needy, clumsy, poor self-image, boring, suicidal, she really got on my nerves...    Edward - waits over 100 years to find his own personal brand of heroin and it is Bella? He is too perfect to be true. Oh wait, he does have one flaw - he loves Bella because she smells good.    Stephanie should have added some danger to this relationship. Afterall, the vamps are killers. How convenient that the Cullens are the most white bread group of vamps ever written. Instead of draining your blood, they bore you to death. Obviously, denying the over-powering instinct to  drink a human's blood must have been an epic struggle in each of their undead lives. Aside from Carlisle, very little explanation is given on how each of these characters arrived at this decision. Rosalie was the only one who tried to convince Bella that she should think long and hard about the big change that was headed her way.    But wait... it was a big change... like winning the lottery. After becoming an official member of the undead you get:    To become perfect, beautiful, talented, invicible, brillant...  A brand new Ferrari.  A delightful cottage in the woods (reminded me of the hobbits).  A huge closet full of designer clothes.  An Amex black card - go anywhere, buy anything.  An adoring husband who will love you forever, and ever, and ever....    Not a bad deal. Where do I sign up?    On to the other members of the 'I love Bella, but don't know why' club:    Charlie - dull and clueless - only wants to watch sports and fish. Mr. Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Come on, you never suspected Edward was spending that many nights in Bella's room and you call yourself the Chief of Police?Renee - self-absorbed, absent, agrees that Bella is more mature - ya think?    Jacob - pet wolf, lacks self-respect, pathetic. How could Bella be sooo conflicted between Jacob and Edward? She abused the poor dog time and time again and he kept coming back for more. When he finally realized Bella would never be his, he just did the next best thing and \\"imprinted\\" on her newborn daughter. Now this may work fine for geese, but it's really creepy and a very stupid plot contrivance.    Other annoyances:    Werewolves - a totally unnecessary addition to the plot. I am so tired of the lame vampires vs. werewolves battle. Rip this whole concept right out of the books.    Volturi - all bark and no bite. I was waiting for the epic battle which NEVER came. This group should have presented itself as a more immediate danger throughout the series. Instead, veiled threats until Breaking Dawn and then what happens... Bella shields everyone with her new found power, the werewolves stand beside the vamps, and the terrifying Volturi pronounce baby Nessie (gag) only a technical foul. I don't think Stephanie can write a battle scene. This should have been the epic good vs. evil, duke it out, somebody dies for their principles conclusion to this whole series. Instead, it was about as exciting as watching one of those Senate confirmation hearings.    Nessie - ridiculous name and ridiculous creature. Bella gets pregnant on her honeymoon and immediately starts showing. A mood killer if there ever was one. The fetus grows at a frightening pace and begins ripping Bella apart. I kept waiting for Sigourney Weaver to show up and pop it right out before killing IT once and for all.    Getting married right after high school and having a baby - what??? The whole series is filled with unconventional relationships; however, Edward insists that Bella marry him before he agrees to make her a vamp. And then what happens... she \\"dies\\" giving birth and Edward has to save her by injecting a syringe ofhis venom directly into her heart. Not the bite on the neck while staring into his dreamy eyes that she was hoping for. Another BIG let down.    Even if my comments are harsh, I did enjoy the first book - Twilight. It was full of hope and promise. It made me remember how I felt about my first serious boyfriend and our relationship... all of the drama and sexual tension. I only wish the other books stuck more closely to this theme instead of taking us on tangents that were unnecessary and unsatisfying. But, I guess you make a lot more money writing four books instead of two. Maybe she was paid by the word???
B000EBD9TY|4.0|I haven't seen many older films. But I'm starting to get into them more. I picked this as I am a big fan of Vivien Leigh in GWTW. I was blown away by Brando though, wow, was he good looking. I really loved this movie from start to finish.<br />The only problem i have is that i actually had no idea that Stanley had raped Blanche in the end. I learned that from watching the special features on disc 2. I guess in that era they really couldnt show much as far as a rape scene, but I really had no idea. So when the sent Blanche away to be committed, i really didnt quite understand why, or what pushed her over the edge. But knowing everything, it makes the film even better.<br />Second issue i have is the crap quality of the dvd itself, i realize its an old film, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. I had my brand new tv turned up nearly as loud as it goes and i still couldnt understand everything as it was muffled. eventually i just put the subtitles on as i was afraid i'd miss something.<br />Aside from those two, i love this movie and feel much better that i know what this controversy is all about, i got a little piece of film history knowledge. they really dont make them like this anymore......this was much more tasteful than any garbage put out nowadays. thumbs up! Great piece of american cinema and film history!
0312944098|4.0|THE SETUP<br />Garage mechanic Danny Cartwright asks Elisabeth Wilson to marry him.  While celebrating in a pub, a group of upper class men insult Elizabeth and a fight results, in which Elisabeth's brother and Danny's best friend, Bernie is killed.  Incredibly, Danny is accused of the murder of Bernie, in part on the theory that killed so that Danny would inherit Bernard's father's business.  That's the setup, but it is just the beginning of the first &quot;book&quot;, of a series of short &quot;books&quot;.<br /><br />CUDOS<br />Many popular authors would have published these as a series of novels, each consisting of sufficient mindless filler to achieve the necessary page count. Instead, Archer has taken the &quot;Law and Order&quot; approach, producing well-paced clean rich interconnected stories which entertain the mind like the best Swiss chocolate pleases the taste buds.<br />COMMENTS<br />As the title suggests, a few chapters into the novel, I feared that it would degenerated into one of those dismal &quot;English class-resentment rants&quot;.  Class is a theme, but with a twist.  In prison, Danny, a low-class, illiterate, &quot;East-Ender&quot; and upper class Nick Moncrief are cellmates.  Nick teaches Danny basic civilized manners and how to read.  The two are so similar physically that, when Nick is murdered, Danny succeeds in taking his place, becoming Sir Nicholas Moncrief-- the British equivalent of a Horatio Alger story--and just as unlikely.  Caveat, many &quot;Horatio Alger&quot; stories are true.<br /><br />Actually most Americans could benefit from reading more &quot;English class-resentment rants&quot;.  In our relatively class-mobile society, it is inconceivable to most Americans that a society of a homogenous ethnicity could be so fractured.  The phenomenon shines perspective on what we misperceive as racial conflicts.  For example, the Japanese and Chinese immigrated to the U.S. as a wretchedly poor and despised underclass, but refused to remain so, and now outshine Euro-Americans--jolly good show!  When the Irish immigrated to the U.S., they voluntarily remained an resentful underclass for nearly a century, until one of their number achieved the Presidency.  Let us pray that example is repeated.<br /><br />CAVEATS<br />&quot;Prisoner of Birth&quot; is a bit predictable.  Predicable is not a negative attribute of novels--indeed, readers are rewarded by predictable novels, albeit the reward is proportional to the challenge.  Archer sets the bar a bit low.  Ppredictability can become a liability, as it does in this novel, when the participants (the characters themselves) are too stupid to see the blatantly obvious.  Conversely, a  twist (an unpredictable event) can add excitement to a novel, but can become a liability (as it does in the only significant twist in this novel) when the author has mislead the reader, in which case the reader can feel betrayed.  Note to authors: let your characters mislead the reader, don't do it yourself (as the &quot;anonymous omniscient narrator&quot;.  There is a HUGE difference between, &quot;Spencer noticed that the scar had faded&quot; and &quot;The scar had faded over the years&quot;).<br /><br />VERDICT<br />There are many other serious inconsistences, implausibilities, loose ends, and other hairballs.  Insulting your reader's intelligence is the easiest way to loose stars.  Is editing a completely abandoned profession?  Give it 7 stars for the great novel it would have been with a little editing, and deduct 3 for the serious (but easily correctable) shortcomings.in so, and now outshine Euro-Americans--jolly good show!

0393327655|5.0|Mr. Harris should be given a ticker-tape parade for having the courage to write \\"The End of Faith.\\" Unlike Richard Dawkins' or Christopher Hitchens' recent books, this is not a treatise advocating atheism. It's even better. He doesn't focus all his energy on the loony fundamentalist manifestations, but also on apologists who wrongly believe that common ground can be found. As he so cogently states, \\"Religious violence is still with us because our religions are intrinsically hostile to one another.\\" The author persuasively argues the horrendous toll religious faiths had and continue to have upon the world's people.<br /><br />Mr. Harris' logical arguments cut deep and are sound. He bravely tackles not only Christianity and Judaism, but also the destructive nature of the Muslim faith. The reading isn't as playful as Dawkins' or Hitchens' polemics and more worrisome in delivery. This is a thinking person's book. Well worth reading if you wonder why warfare is so persistently prevalent in the world. Sadly, Mr. Harris' dissertation will not alter this ageless paradigm.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Fans of goth rock band Evanescence's break-through album, \\"Fallen\\", will not be disappointed with the follow-up album, \\"The Open Door\\".  Amy Lee's pipes soar higher than ever before on tracks like \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", an assumed reference to former boyfriend Shaun Morgan of Seether fame, and \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", the CD's opener.  John Lecompt, Rocky Gray and Terry Balsamo do an excellent job of backing up Lee's vocals on this CD with their heavy percussion, guitar riffs that are just as angry as she is, and the electronica binding that ties it all together.<br /><br />The instrumentals are more haunting here than on \\"Fallen\\".  They are angry, biting and paint the dark, gothic background that Lee achieves in her equally dark lyrics.  On this album, Lee writes more intimately.  Her topics range from her love and insecurity towards her soon-to-be husband on \\"Good Enough\\", to the death of her sister on \\"Like You\\".<br /><br />This album chronicles the messy feelings that occur after a break-up, and it is most likely Lee's way of dealing with her own.  You can definitely take this journey with her, relating to the dark tunnels and murky rivers she paints, and blossoming with her by the CD's end.  Below is a brief description of each track on the CD, a numeric rating from 1-10 and the reasons why you should consider this album as your next purchase.<br /><br />Track 1: Sweet Sacrifice--(9)--a ferocious opener.  Lee is calling someone out on being a martyr.  The angry guitars and electronica roar behind her, complementing her fury.<br /><br />Track 2: Call Me When You're Sober--(10)--Lee's vocals on this song are incredible.  Here she is telling her former lover not to wax poetic because she knows he doesn't really love her or he'd be there with her.<br /><br />Track 3: Weight of the World--(8)--Lee is trying to free herself of the person she used to be.  She wants to escape from her cocoon and be a new person without anyone dragging her down by reminding her of the past.<br /><br />Track 4: Lithium--(9)--another track where Lee's voice shines.  Here, she succumbs to the loneliness and darkness that come with a separation.  She is flirting with desparation.  She will forgive her former lover because it's better than being alone, even though she knows better.<br /><br />Track 5: Cloud Nine--(9)--Lee reclaims her former sense of self on this track.  She tells her lover that he can leave, live his own life, do whatever he wants.  She is going to do what she wants and if she ends up alone, so be it.<br /><br />Track 6: Snow White Queen--(5)--one of the weaker songs on the album and obvious filler.  This song doesn't fit with the break-up/fix myself theme of the rest of the album.  Here, Lee relates her fear of her obsessive fans.<br /><br />Track 7: Lacrymosa--(5)--this track is also weaker than the rest of the album, but it is more appropriate to the album's theme.  Lee forgives her former lover and insists that he can blame her for everything if that's what helps him get better.<br /><br />Track 8: Like  You--(6)--on this very dark track, almost too dark to enjoy, Lee deals with the death of her sister and will not feel better until she can be in the ground with her.<br /><br />Track 9: Lose Control--(8)--a lighter, naughtier track that provides relief from the darkness of the album.  Feeling her oats as someone who is newly single and free, Lee wants to explore other options and lose control sexually with someone she finds attractive just once.<br /><br />Track 10: The Only One--(6)--oddly, this song starts off with a few sound effects including a duck quack, yet, there is great percussion on this track.  Here, Lee is telling her former lover that he's not the only one who's miserable and not the only one at fault.  She will let go and find peace.<br /><br />Track 11: Your Star--(8)--a strong guitar riff features prominantly here, where Lee is accepting that she can't be her former lover's \\"everything\\".  She needs to find her ownway and he needs to become his own person.<br /><br />Track 12: All That I'm Living For--(8)--here Lee shows vulnerability.  She admits that she could try to keep running, but that she'd eventually have to stop and mourn her former love.  She is trying hard to leave her ghosts behind and move on.<br /><br />Track 13: Good Enough--(9)--the beginning of this track was actually a longer instrumental due to be used in the first Chronicles of Narnia film, but the idea was scrapped.  Here, we come to the end of the grieving process.  Lee has put the other twelve tracks behind her and can finally accept a new love.  And even though she is waiting for the other shoe to drop, she will meekly begin to accept once again that she can be loved.way and he needs to become his own person.<br /><br />Track 12: All That I'm Living For--(8)--here Lee shows vulnerability.

B0002KVUKW|1.0|As far as I am concerned the movie \\"Van Helsing\\" (2004) was  a terrible film that should have all fans of the old Universal horror films up in arms and storming the studio with torches.  This film, which is described in the Amazon product description as being made for gamers (because of terrible graphics) and eight year olds because of the weak plot, was a total dissapointment to me.<br /><br />Since so much has already been written, I won't waste the magnetic ink on this very poor film and just say to all fans of the old Universal horror movies, rise up and storm the studio!<br /><br />I am not a traditionalist and you can check my voting record to see how I voted on new vs old horror films.  This movie was an insult having no integrity and not taking itself or horror films \\"seriously\\".  Lots of computer graphics and motion capture went into making this giant movie which came off looking like a cartoon.<br /><br />By the way, the voting distribution was clearly bi-modal with a maximum of both five stars and a single star.  Clearly, some of us loved and hated this film. In such circumstances the mean (~3 stars) is somewhat meaningless.<br /><br />Although not granted any points for readers thinking my article was useful I am happy to see that 166 have voted this terrible film only a single star to date!  Also glad to see that 50% of all voters felt this film rated three stars or less!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|While I won't waste time reiterating what countless others have said, I will simply state that Watchmen the movie completely lived up to the bar set by Watchmen the comic.  That's not to say one is better than the other, but simply, as a film, it worked.  There are slight differences between the source material, but that's because their are differences between film and literature.   Fans of the comic will not be disappointed, and the same goes for fans of great cinema.  This movie climbs my list of all-time favorites, competing with the likes of Fight Club and The Prestige.     Don't listen to the incessant yammering of people saying it was boring or stupid.  Watchmen is a lot of things, but neither of those.  If you feel it's the latter, do yourself a favor and watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  If you want a real story, full of realistic and flawed characters, all beautifully crafted and put together with genuine love and affection for the source material, then look no further than here.
B00288KNLS|1.0|My first review and most likely my only. I just wanted to warn everybody the 3-D glasses are the old school red/green paper ones. Not the new clear plastic one. The only reason I bought this was for the 3-D but the red/green glasses suck and give me a headache and my depth perception is still off and I stopped watching about 30mins ago.
0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed this novel so much that I finished it in just a few days. I'm definitely going to read the next one in the series but you can tell it was a first time novelist here.  May he rest in peace but man the author just did not want to complete this novel.  The ending dragged on for at least a hundred pages past where it needed to go.  It's a very good book but you'll know what I mean when you read the last hundred pages or so. And there are so many characters that it's hard (ok impossible) to keep track of them all.  Even the protagonist admits that he's having a hard time keeping track of all the members of the Vanger family.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|It's interesting the reviews for this are either all raves (mostly from younger fans, although a few fans of the original series recognize its quality) or rants (mostly from people who felt there was no need to \\"remake\\" or \\"reboot\\" the original) and yet the truth of the matter is somewhere in between.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it -- this is an extremely competent, well-made action film that will keep you entertained as long as action films are your thing.  The acting is first rate, and there are enough tributes to the original series and stars that it doesn't feel like they've forgotten their roots.<br /><br />Indeed, my only problem with this film is that it takes about an hour before it gets past the cliches -- let's see, we have the boy who lost his father growing up into a rebel without a cause, who is damned if he will join the establishment, is hell bent on drinking and bedding any women of any color (including green) that comes along, and who only by chance decides to join the military to make a man out of himself.  And even there he cheats and rankles at authority until the end, when his rebelliousness actually saves the day. Oh, yes, and we also have two men who fight each other tooth and nail until they suddenly realize they are going to be the best of friends.  Never saw that one coming.  Sigh.<br /><br />The early going by-the-numbers script was so predictable that we could have skipped it completely were it not for the excellent performances of such minor stars as Karl Urban (as Bones) who completely steals the show from both Kirk and Spock in the early going, and Simon Pegg (Scotty) who steals the show in the latter half.  It is the supporting cast that makes this fun to watch until the inevitable coming together of Kirk and Spock to form the greatest team in all of science fiction this side of Batman and Superman.<br /><br />Oh, I'll buy the blu-ray when it comes out, and have fun rewatching it, but the REAL fun will come in about two years, when the obligatory sequel will be released and our cast and crew, newly minted, yet much as we have always known them, takes to the stars for what is sure to be a lot more excitement and action.  Until then, this will do.released and our cast and crew, newly minted, yet much as we have always known them, takes to the stars for what is sure to be a lot more excitement and action.

1573229725|5.0|I won't give any spoilers in what follows.  If you read any reviews of this, be careful since part of the enjoyment of this book are its delicious details.<br /><br />Do NOT see the movie first if you are thinking of reading this.  While there are details left out of the movie, it will ruin much of the enjoyment of this book.  (I waited until I had finished the book before watching the movie - which is good and has Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy in it.)<br /><br />This is a novel where almost everyone is a villain, but you are rooting for the ones that have a heart.  With overt allusions to Oliver Twist, the novel begins with part one told from first-person perspective of one character, then in part two some of the same ground is gone over as told through another character's eyes, and the final part is told with the first character's voice again.<br /><br />I enjoy this device.  In these developments, the characters know more later of course but reveal what they thought and felt in real time as the story progresses, and each tale covers earlier ground from a different perspective and then advances the story.  (This is a bit different than when Dickens used a woman as an alternating first-person narrative together with the all-knowing authorial voice in Bleak House -- he purposely makes you understand that the first person is and will be unreliably naive and so the reader is constantly reading between the lines of her descriptions of events when she narrates.)<br /><br />This was my first Sarah Waters book.  Her style is excellent - her characters' speech takes over and is quite believable, and the author fades into the background.  The plot twists are excellent and surprise every reader (I would imagine), but are well within the believability of its setting.<br /><br />I have purchased another of her novels (The Little Stranger).
0316044695|1.0|I too, found this book to be a rather disgusting attempt to political soap box.  Don't get me wrong, I am a USMC vet myself, and I really wanted to read about SEAL Team 10 and the incidents in Afghanistan.  What I didn't expect was Mr. Hollywood Luttrell's political ravings.  First there is the usual liberal bashing, then the political justifications, and, of course, all the desultory details about how big and tough SEAL's are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah...ad nauseam. Then he takes the predictable and tiresome swipes at the press and anyone else who objected to some of the misinformation, falsifications, assumptions and exaggerations that has plagued current US military involvement in both Afghanistan and Iraq.  It is one thing to blow your own horn and go about the blowhard bragging that Hollywood Luttrell undertakes, but it's a shameful affair when you use the deaths of American military personnel as a marketing tool to advance your own political agenda.  I could not finish this book---where is honest reporting and legitimate history? This is money wasted and a huge disappointment.
0439023483|4.0|This book was great.  Started it on the morning commute, couldn't put it down until I finished it later that night.  It has all these great things I love in fiction--humor, strong female protagonist, fast-paced action, totalitarian governments, and battles to the death.  Yes, the premise is almost exactly the same as Battle Royale, but that translation was practically unreadable.  Additionally, this book goes more into the motivations of the government in this sick game.  It had a great pace, the characters, even the minor ones, were fully developed enough that everyone felt real. Collins does a great job of creating a new universe with this book, one with its own history and traditions and even slang.  A perfect afternoon read.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|It was with much trepidation that I approached Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's graphic novel.  Having read the novel several years prior, it had exceeded all my expectations and floored me both intellectually and emotionally.  Zack Snyder had only done the 2004 remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"300,\\" both of which had seemed to be serviceable-yet-shallow films.  And the trailer, which somewhat infamously referred to Snyder as \\"the visionary director of '300,'\\" gave off a vibe of slickness that seemed wholly out-of-sync with my perception of the novel.    When I finally saw the film, I was astonished.  My concerns about Snyder evaporated as Moore's intricately-woven tale spun out on the screen before me.  I loved Haley's Rorschach, Crudup's Manhattan, the dead-on look, and most importantly the apocalyptic tone that had been so absent from the trailer.  There were minor quibbles I had with some of the soundtrack choices and Malin Ackerman came across as wooden, but overall I was absolutely impressed with what Snyder had managed to pull off, and I was disappointed that the film didn't live up to the lofty box-office expectations.  I don't want to engage in a debate regarding the film's merits, but am merely presenting my reaction to my theatrical experience to provide context.    Newly released in a 186 minute director's cut, \\"Watchmen\\" is still a thing of beauty to behold.  Some 24 minutes of footage are added, though I only particularly noticed in a handful of places.  The most significant differences I felt in my viewing were the fate of Hollis Mason and a couple of new beats for Malin Ackerman's Silk Spectre (which seemed to improve her performance).  While I don't feel that the film was spectacularly enhanced with these additions, they do offer enough improvement for me to recommend the DC over the theatrical cut.  If you liked the theatrical cut, I can't see why you wouldn't prefer the DC, and if you were disappointed in the initial version, you may find yourself more placated by this newest version.    The image quality of the release seemed almost flawless on my 32\\" Samsung, and sound was crisp with plenty of bass for the subwoofer.  I was somewhat disappointed by the rather paltry selection of special features, all of which are found on the second disc of the set:  a half-hour long retrospective on the legacy and intent of the graphic novel, a collection of web documentaries (totaling roughly another half hour) that were previously available on the film's website on various aspects of production, the absolutely worthless music video of the My Chemical Romance cover of \\"Desolation Row,\\" and the equally worthless \\"digital copy.\\"  I am aware that the Blu-Ray has additional features, including an \\"enhanced experience\\" that functions as a commentary and a couple of other documentaries, and I find it unfortunate that WB is attempting to \\"coerce\\" buyers into upgrading in this way.  Luckily, the film is well-worth owning despite the underwhelming selection of features on this DVD release and a purchase is still highly recommended.    NOTE:  A 5-disc \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is scheduled for release in December with the half-hour \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" short integrated into the DC (for a running time of three-and-a-half hours), commentary with Snyder and Dave Gibbons, the \\"Under the Hood\\" and Complete Motion Comic included as extras, as well as other documentaries.  A $10 coupon for the UCE is included in the box, and it was announced back in January.  Personally, I don't feel that the animated short is going to fit in with the rest of the film all that well and am skeptical of purchasing the UCE, but I do believe that consumers have a right to be informed before making their purchase.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|Speaking as a classical music semi-novice (I'm familiar with several of the pieces here, but don't own multiple recordings), this collection is absolutely captivating--bright and vivid tonality, wonderful dynamics, fluid and impassioned phrasing. She plays with great verve and personality. The collection feels unified by her love of the music--there's nothing that feels like \\"filler,\\" or like she threw it in merely because it fit the style of the collection. One of my favorite classical music recordings.
0679720200|2.0|The Stranger, translated by Matthew Ward, was not a great story, but it was easy to read and slightly interesting enough to continue on with it.  Although in the end I did feel like it had been a waste of my time.  I would love to have read this story how it was originally intended as written in French.  Not as someone else's translation.  The book is entirely written in short choppy sentences.  There are many instances of information being given that is unnecessary... \\"After lunch I was a little bored and I wandered around the apartment\\".  We read every thought going on inside this man's head.... \\"My cigarette tasted bitter\\".  \\"I was tired\\". In a way I liked the narrative of his life and would almost like to see it used with another story.  But it also got very tiring reading about the mundane things that were not relevant to the story.  I thought that this story was more interesting in the beginning.  The story didn't flow as well and became more confusing by the second half of the story.  The character was very passive and could care less about everything, which made you wonder how he could get involved with the pimp in the first place.  Obviously I did not get \\"it\\", whatever \\"it\\" is that I was supposed to get from this book.  I think this is one of those books that are heavily blown out of proportion and given accolades that aren't well deserved.  I believe this is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes, where no one wants to be the first to say this story stinks in fear of making themselves look bad.  In the end I have to say this story does indeed stink.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Bought the Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds spectacular.  I love the movie, and the Director's cut, while it takes a little effort to sit all the way through (which is understandable, given the depth of the source material,) fleshes the movie out just enough without overstaying its welcome.    My only gripe is this:  I have always liked having the TRAILERS for the movies I buy on DVD and Blu-Ray to be available on the discs.  If they have all the space on the discs for extras, they can fit in the trailers.  If for no other reason than that I tend to show them to friends and family when we're trying to decide what movies to watch.  The Watchmen Blu-Ray doesn't include the trailers, and that's a real shame because Warners cut together an EXCEPTIONAL teaser trailer for this film.  It really should have been included on the disc.  Hopefully I'm not the only one arguing for the continuation of the original previews being included on DVDs and Blu-Rays, and hopefully the studios will take notice.
0060264314|5.0|Whenever I read these books, the descriptions of food and how meals were made always make me hungry!
B002EULANU|5.0|Kudos to Max!  I love the groove of the entire album...a mixture of funk, a bit of mellowness and touch of jazz = grown and sexy. What a nice combination. BLACK should not be compared to his previous work of some 8 - 12 years ago.  Open your ears and change with the times for those of you who want to compare the sound of this album to UHS or other albums.  Yes, BLACK only has 9 songs. I would say the best is yet to come.   Per Max as heard on the TJMS, BLACK, 2009, 9 songs, 10 songs for the 2010 album and 11 songs for the 2011 album.  BLACK...definitely a winner in my book.
0385341008|5.0|A wonderful little book! Found it at the airport while browsing and looking for something to read on my longhaul flight (I had forgotten  the book I wanted to read at home). From the first page I was drawn into the story and its wonderful assortment of characters. Highly recommend this!
B000W746GK|5.0|Have no fear (unless you don't like snakes and spiders). This one is superb.<br /><br />Everything about the Potter film adaptations improves in this sharp, well paced sequel to 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. Radcliffe builds on his previous performance and reaches truly impressive heights as Harry. Emma Watson is impressive as always as Hermione. It's a tour de force of spellbinding special effects, fun turns from top notch British actors as Hogwarts employees and a cleverly plotted mystery that at once intrigues, excites and forwards our knowledge of Harry Potter's world. This film is surprisingly watchable at 160 minutes and definitely raises the stakes for the franchise, meeting the challenge on every level. This is, in some regards a kid's movie, but there is a lot going on to keep mature minds engaged - not the least that the film is genuinely scary - even with it's PG rating. If you can't handle spiders, you might want to look away for around 10 minutes in the middle. The most intriguing aspect of the film is the way it develops the depth of Harry's character sharpening our interest for future installments and the clever commentary on racism in the 'mugborn' subplot raises the themes in the whole series to a new level. In short, the ideal combination of J K Rowling and the filmmakers combine to produce an exciting and authentic translation of her novel.
B00284BMBM|3.0|Although I'm primarily a rock and metal fan I loved the first CD because it was a well defined, well rounded mostly light/contemporary rock CD that showcased Chris Daughtry's voice as a lead singer and the whole band.  The musical arrangements were good.  The previous CD was clean and deliberate.    When this new CD came out I was obsessed with getting it because everywhere I went it was sold out.   So I thought this must be the greatest CD ever right?  Not quite......  Chris shows off his great pipes and the band is clearly talented but many songs sound a bit young for the group.  \\"Supernatural\\" and a few others (#5) sound like Kelly Clarkson tunes.  A few more sound like Jonas Brother songs.  Most have a very young feel and songs with pretty basic subject matter all about love relationships.  I would think the band was more complex and have more to write about with their life lessons even if it's observing others hardships.     The new CD uses a lot of dubbing (voice layering)/group singing of whole songs not just for the chorus.  So many songs don't sound fresh but very \\"80's/90's pop\\" making them sound the same (My Mom loves it, said it sounds like REO Speedwagon).  The musical arrangements on the CD seemed old school and forced too.  Like trying to make some songs better than they are.      A few better songs are when Chris is able to lead with his singular voice like the country style tune on the CD.    You really don't hear the familiar fiddle until the end.   I don't mind if the band decided to go all pop.  But it's not innovative, fresh or new, it's like a copy of stuff that's been done over and over again.  I just feel like this CD is covers songs of mostly choruses and anthems.  And the tracks seem to be placed in a disorganized manner.  They don't flow well from one song to the other.  I'll always like Daughtry but this is not my favorite CD.
B001NLL0RW|2.0|Childish and silly are the only two words that come to mind.  Mr. Rollins story is even more predictable than the writngs of Clive Cussler which is certainly no mean feat.  I purchased this book on impulse as it was recommended reading for me by Amazon based on other things I have read.  I will be VERY wary of those recommendations in the future
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This is a classic album.  Every song on here is great, with the exception of the remixes, which appear to me as Michael Jackson had very little to do with.    There is a better version of this album with demos of a couple of his classic songs.  That is the one I'd recommend over this, unless you're a huge Michael Jackson fan.  Still, it's a classic album and it gets 5-stars from me.  Unreleased song from the Thriller sessions is ok.
0374264260|4.0|I think it had to do with the voice of our narrator - I think Matthew Quick got that JUST right!  And the story was very well paced.  The mystery unfolded in just the right place -- slowly enough to keep the reader interested, but not so slowly that one stops caring.    Not being a rabid NFL fan, it was interesting to get into the mind of not one, but many rabid fans.  It was not off-putting to me - a woman, and a casual football watcher.      Overall, I give it 4 stars.  It was a great book, but not one of my all-time favorites. It was completely entertaining, but it won't change my life.
B000083LQB|4.0|A continuing trend among cd packages is double disc deluxe, or legacy editions. Universal music calls their's deluxe, Sony calls their's Legacy. Basically these are \\"remasters\\" with additional material included. These releases are generally for more serious collectors of a particular artist. Sonic youth \\"Dirty\\" deluxe includes some B sides and self produced tracks recorded on an 8 track machine at their rehearsal space, some are the genesis of songs on Dirty, others are SY noise improvisations. Most of the extra tracks are instrumental. Anyone who is getting deeper into this band's catalog will probably want this deluxe release. Less committed fans would do better to buy the single disc original album release. The remastering of the original album material more distinctly seperates each instrument which makes me wonder if there was'nt some remixing in addition to remastering. In short, Dirty now sounds cleaner. On some tracks I prefer the murkier quality of the original, others are better on this new version. In either case the excellent production by Butch Vig comes through- Dirty is one of the best sounding records Sonic Youth ever made.
B0007939NO|3.0|Two American bachelor buddies (Gene Kelly and Van Johnson) are on a grouse-shooting holiday in Scotland. They get lost in the hills, and in the morning they stumble on a picturesque village right out of the 18th century which is not on their map. At first the villagers seem strangely spooked by the newcomers, but eventually the two are caught up in the pre-nuptial celebrations of dashing Charlie Dalrymple and beautiful Jean Campbell. Complications ensue when one of the Yanks meets Jean's older sister Fiona (Cyd Charisse). Love blooms, even though he has a fiancee back in New York. Turns out, though, that there's something much deeper which might keep them apart...     MGM's 1954 film adaptation of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's *Brigadoon* is a largely forgotten product of the studio's glory period for musicals - *Singin' in the Rain* (1952), *An American in Paris* (1951), *The Band Wagon* (1953), *Seven Brides for Seven Brothers* (1954) - just to name a few!. On the face of it this seems odd. After all, *Brigadoon* was the handiwork of MGM's first-team \\"Freed unit\\" (Arthur Freed was the producer of most of MGM's legendary late '40's and '50's musicals), unlike \\"Seven Brides\\", which was shot at the same time (but which was much more successful both critically and financially). Directed by Vincente Minnelli, starring Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, with contract star Van Johnson thrown in for comic relief, based on Lerner and Loewe's 1947 Broadway smash - how could it go wrong?     Well, it didn't go *completely* wrong. On its own merits it's a pleasant 2-hour diversion. But any comparison with other productions exposes some serious gaffes made in the process of adapting it from the stage to the screen. Supposedly for financial reasons, MGM scrapped a plan to film on location in the Scottish highlands and used the studio backlot - thus missing a great chance to \\"open up\\" a stagebound story. This isn't necessarily fatal. In fact \\"Seven Brides\\", with a plot even more outdoorsy, was also a studio production, but suffers much less from the jarringly obvious painted backdrops and awkward plant and animal props that we find in MGM's *Brigadoon*. Even the 1966 television production (on which see below) had the sense to move at least some scenes outside. It doesn't help that MGM also saved money on the coloring process - glorious (but costly) Technicolor was replaced by something called \\"Anscocolor\\", one of the cheaper alternatives which were just making their appearance in Hollywood at this time but which undoubtably lack the warm glow of 3-strip Technicolor.     The main problem, however, lies in the fact that this adaptation of the stage musical shoehorns Lerner and Loewe's lush romantic songfest into a dancing extravaganza - a problem which can surely be laid at the feet of Freed, Minnelli, and also Gene Kelly, who was in charge of the choreography and around whom the film is obviously built. Unlike any of the other musicals mentioned above, *Brigadoon* was an expensive stage property, not an original movie musical, and the studio had much less flexibility in adapting it to suit the talents of its stars. The Broadway cast of Marion Bell and David Brooks were singers, not dancers; their film counterparts, Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly, simply lack the pipes to do justice to many of L. and L.'s lovely songs. Rumour has it that MGM had considered casting Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel in place of Charisse and Kelly (they had harmonized together beautifully in the otherwise rambling *Show Boat* of 1951, and again in the delightful *Kiss Me Kate* of 1953), but that's not how things worked out. Charisse had no singing voice at all, and was dubbed (by Carol Richards); Kelly had a reedy voice which could be effective in the right scene (no complaints about *Singin' in the Rain!*) but is seriously strained in \\"Go Home with Bonny Jean\\", \\"Heather on the Hill\\", and \\"It's Almost Like Being in Love\\". In fact the latter song is a glorious duetbetween the lovers in the stage show; Kelly does it solo in the film. Instead, what we get between the two lovers in the film is dancing - very elegant, in fact quite balletic (Charisse's specialty), but it goes on and on, and serves again to bring out the artificial studio sets, with Charisse and Kelly dancing around potted heather plants when they're supposed to be wandering over heathered hillsides. Even worse, all this dancing crowds out some of L.& L.'s most beautiful music. One of the best things about the film is tenor Jimmy Thompson, who plays Charlie Dalrymple. On the stage, Charlie has the ballads \\"Go Home with Bonny Jean\\", and \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\". In the film he has to share \\"Bonny Jean\\" with Kelly and Johnson, and \\"Come to Me\\" didn't even make the final cut. One of the liveliest stage characters is the milkmaid Meg Brockie, who sings the spirited \\"Real Love of My Life\\" and \\"My Mother's Wedding Day\\". The film (in which she's played by Dodie Heath) preserves some of the comic byplay with Van Johnson, but scraps her songs. Likewise for the girls' chorus \\"Jeannie's Packin' Up\\". Two other songs by the male lead, \\"There But for You Go I\\", and \\"From This Day On\\", were also cut, but this may have been a mercy killing; they survive on the cast recording and as out-takes on the DVD, and they show Gene Kelly's voice to very poor advantage indeed. I should add that many (not all) of these cut songs can be found in the cast recording and as extras on the DVD.     Another out-take on the DVD is the Sword Dance which is part of Jean and Charlie's wedding. The fact that it was cut brings up another matter; the ensemble scenes in the film. These are in fact one of the more attractive elements of the movie, in particular the McConnachy Square market scene. It's worth noting that in the Broadway show the emphasis was on the ensemble dancing, not the individual, and was choreographed by none other than Agnes de Mille. Yes, one must admit that the splashy plaids and kilts and hose and tam-o-shanters show a Scotland that has never existed outside a tourist brochure, and that the level of brogue you hear ebbs and flows suspiciously. But the tone is light, and the hoofing of Kelly - and even Van Johnson! - fits in nicely here. The \\"Run and Get Him\\" chase scene is also well done, and integrates Kelly and Johnson in unexpected ways.     A light fantasy like *Brigadoon* doesn't require soul-stirring acting, and this isn't one of the show's problems. Kelly adds a nice touch of mischief to his portrayal of the torn lover, and if Johnson is a little too cynical for my taste in his role as the wisecracking sidekick, he and the man-hunting Dodie Heath do have fun in their scene together. Barry Jones is appropriately benevolent as Mr. Lundie, the elderly schoolmaster who has all the answers.     The real fish out of water here is Cyd Charisse. Let's ignore the fact that, with her height and exotic beauty and non-period dress, she looks about as Scottish as Charlie Chan. The truth is that she just doesn't have the acting chops to sustain a role this important to the plot. Outside of the dances, she and Kelly have surprisingly little time together on screen and develop no romantic chemistry. It's not hard to see why she had a non-speaking role in *Singin' in the Rain* and a more marginal one in *The Band Wagon*.     My parting reflection on *Brigadoon*? If you just have to own it, buy it as part of one of the various DVD packages that Warner has available. It's paired with the much superior *On the Town* (1949), also with Gene Kelly, and with several other MGM musicals in the \\"Warner's Classic Musicals Collection\\" set. Otherwise, it's a harmless rainy-day rental or worth a look on television.   **PS** - The 1966 ABC televsion production of *Brigadoon*, thought to be lost, has miraculously appeared on YouTube IN ITS ENTIRETY! Although a 90-minute abridgement of the Broadway show (and subject to the limitations of YouTube, of course), it is muchtruer to the Lerner and Loewe production, and features almost all the original score, wonderfully rendered by Robert Goulet and Sally Ann Howes, ably seconded by Peter Falk (!!) in the Van Johnson role and Marlyn Mason as Meg Brockie with almost all her role intact. There's also Finlay Currie, in almost his last role, as Mr. Lundie.    **PS** - DRG has come out with a splendid remastering of the classic 1958 Columbia recording of *Brigadoon*, with Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, almost certainly the best audio version of this musical.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|After watching and enjoying series three i didn't think anything could top the finale of series three. I was wrong. Series four is my favorite series yet, mainly because this series had mostly great episodes compared to the first three series which only had a handful of good episodes.<br /><br />With Catherine Tate returning as a companion even the dull episodes can pack a few laughs, although only a small amount of episodes are dull. The episodes Voyage of the Damned,  The Fires of Pompeii,  and The Unicorn and the Wasp are my least favorite this series.  This series sees the return of the Odd, and shows the cruelty of humans. But the two-part finale packs a punch featuring every companion from the previous series, along with the return of the daleks.  The episode Midnight is one of my favorite episodes off all, being different than the rest by being a psychological thriller, and can suck you completely in.<br /><br />The DVD isn't worth the price however, as there isn't very many special features to justify the price. As there is only 13 episodes. But if you can find a great deal on this DVD, get it and it should be worth your while. Be warned: the special effects are not the greatest compared to most US shows, but you can get used to it after a while and still become attached.<br /><br />This series doesn't have much of a story arc like the previous series, which makes it full of surprises! This series is also very dramatic like the finale of the second series, which easily allows people to become attached. I very rarely enjoy a TV show enough to give it 5 stars. But Series 4 of Doctor Who deserves it!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I remember seeing the trailer and thinking that this was just another vietnam war movie, but I was wrong. This is my favorite performance by Ben Stiller yet, and Robert Downey Jr. was also surprising hilarious!<br /><br />The movie is about a group of actors who are filming a war movie when they get into an argument with their director and the direct decides to send them into a hostile jungle without a film set.  The movie begins with showing trailers of three main characters most famous movies. Stiller is an action movie star who's career has hit a low. Downey is an australian actor who had his skin darkened to play as an African American. Black is a comedian know for fart jokes in his films. They act like the jungle is just a set, but after a while they realize that this is real. And they are tracked down by the flaming dragon gang who capture Stiller's character. Tom Crusie is also in an surprising role as the studio executive with a bad temper.<br /><br />After many dull comedy films Tropic Thunder seems to have made action comedies fun again. It is worth watching over and over again.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Pixar has never faulted in making great films that can last, Wall-E is no different. Every Pixar movie is so so creatively different than the previous film that its impossible to guess what is next. Wall-E is much different than previous Pixar films as it goes into the future and space, something only mentioned before.<br /><br />Wall-E gives us all a lesson on protecting the planet. It is thousands of years into the future and earth is no longer habitable from the pollution and junk littered throughout the landscape. Wall-E discovers a plant which leads to an adventure in space with the many humans living on a spaceship. This movie hardly has much dialogue which makes it more creative and in some ways a better movie.  Mainly it is a family movie but it is fun to watch for all ages. Pixar has once again made a great hit and it will last for many years to come.<br /><br />On the DVD: the case itself is eco-friendly which makes it easier to accidently break. The DVD also has only a small bit of special features. But if you just want to watch a movie go ahead and look for the single disc version in a normal DVD case. If you want extra content get the three disc version, but this does have two short films and deleted scenes, but these features don't last very long.
B000WS4QJG|4.0|Beat It, Thriller, and Billie Jean should be a good enough reason to buy this already. But there are other great songs on here too. Wanna be startin' something and Human Nature are also fantastic songs.<br /><br />The 25 version CD alone is great but the remixes added to the album aren't very memorable compared to the original songs. What makes the 25th version of Thriller so great is the DVD included with the album containing the short films of Billie Jean, Beat It, and Thriller along with the epic Motown performance of Billie Jean at Motown 25 where he did the famous moonwalk. Overall, every Michael Jackson fan should own Thriller 25, it is worth it. The only reason it doesn't get the five stars it would deserve is that the extra tracks are a waste of time and take a little away from the rest of the album.
1931788340|4.0|It's an interesting look back at a low point in U.S. culture.  For anyone who lived through the 70s will remember just how depressing it was at times and what was no doubt the low of 20th century American culture.    A great book but also a bit depressing.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I saw Uta hagen and Elaine Strich do Martha, and others do George, but nothing prepared me for Elizabeth Taylor and Richrad Burton in this. I love them in many other films, but this was indeed a left turn I never expected.    Richard Burton is so hacked to peices, and Elizabeth Taylor preys on him with unrelenting fury, and then he turns on her, she on him, and again and again, until the tables have turned so much, we are in a kind of dervish, whirling in chaos and despair.    There is humor in this, and it ties in with Edward Albee's sense of an anguish lurking in the backgrounds of these people, the utter impossibility of right reason or relationship in any kind of existence you could mention.    A work of genius.    All praise to George Segal and to Sandy Dennis and Mike Nichols, and of course, Albee.
B0018QQQKS|1.0|Not a reality-based book. According to Ferguson, Chile is the model. Awesome privatized pension system even though most in the system have greater losses than gains and fewer than 10% will be able to actually have enough to retire. Pinochet saved Chile (?!!!) and Milton Friedman is God. Mostly pretentious but mindless propaganda. Great stuff for Kool Aid drinkers.
1577314808|4.0|In \\"The Power of Now\\" Tolle introduces the reader to the experience of living in the present moment-in the \\"Now.\\" He explains how misery, suffering and unhappiness in the world are the consequence of living an \\"unconscious\\" life of grasping for things, being the servant of our ego and our conditioned responses, clinging to the past and fretting about the future, yearning for certainty in an uncertain world. His message of accepting what \\"is\\" and finding freedom in the present moment is not new, but is fresh and lucid. He draws from Buddhist and Daoist ideas and in an involving style quietly leads us toward the experience of \\"Being.\\" For those who are looking for a self-help book of lists, steps and formulas to achieve enlightenment, you will not find it here, and appropriately so. The mantra Tolle repeats is that there is no formula. What Tolle is teaching is not an idea, but an experience. The challenge of putting this experience into words is always fraught with danger-the danger of too rigidly relying on language to convey what cannot be spoken. Tolle warns us of this and to some extent succeeds in avoiding traps of language.     I recommend this book, but have some quibbles. My greatest objection concerns Tolle's belief that humans are evolving or progressing toward a greater consciousness. I see no compelling evidence of this on our battered planet. Pockets of consciousness exist, yes, but overshadowed by a massive inventory of pervasive human dysfunction, not only at the level of nation pitted against nation, but right down to the level of our crime ridden streets, our broken families, and our strife filled relationships. Tolle's conviction in the evolution of consciousness seems mostly wishful thinking, and as such, a manifestation of ego yearning for a fanciful future. There is some danger that Tolle's overenthusiastic proselytizing can become transformed into an ideology of perfection, leaping beyond all boundaries of human knowledge, much like Hegel's idealist philosophy of historical unfolding toward absolute Self-Consciousness. We should not let ourselves be too taken in by our technological feats, lulling ourselves with the self-congratulatory belief in our spiritual and moral advance. The simple truth is that none of us know what the future holds. The more realistic, earth bound scenario, based on what we know of mankind up to this point, is that we will continue to oscillate between ego clinging and release, and that the tide can quickly turn in the opposite direction with little warning. Our ego dominates the world. The war in Iraq is a war of ego. The war on drugs is a war of ego. The war of good against evil is a war of ego. The language of \\"war\\" that permeates our social and political life shows how far we are from what Tolle hopes for.     Tolle in \\"The Power of Now\\" gives creative, idiosyncratic interpretations of passages and parables in the Bible, taking these as unequivocal metaphors of living a conscious as opposed to an unconscious, time bound, self invested, existence. He thus weaves together God and Being into the single notion of Presence. While his interpretation of Biblical passages is imaginative and emotionally awakening, I take issue with his rather black and white peremptory attitude that his interpretation is the only correct view of what the prophets had intended. What we instead have is Tolle's own unique spin. This peremptory tone comes through repeatedly across the pages, and should at least give one pause to consider that Tolle, himself, is still not free of his own ego. On the one hand Tolle attunes us to the illusory nature of form and of opposites in our constructed, ego invested world, and yet at the same time, he imposes his own personal form on us. Contradictions, of course, are inevitable whenever anyone tackles a subject as daunting and ineffable as the nature of reality, but to speak with grand conviction as Tolle does, while ignoring his own susceptibility to contradiction anderror is perhaps evidence of his own ego boundness.     Human probes into the nature of reality humble us all, and Tolle's periodic pompous tone seems out of place and not in the spirit of Buddhist teaching. It took away from his otherwise lucid, engaging style. Even so, if we were to follow the path Tolle opens for us, and we all came closer to living in the Now, the world probably would be a better home for us and future generations.
0132350882|5.0|This book is split into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code--of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \\"smells\\" gathered while creating the case studies.<br /><br />The book begins by describing what clean code actually is. This is achieved through discussing quotes provided by people such as Bjarne Stroustrup, Grady Booch, Dave Thomas, Michael Feathers, Ron Jeffries, Ward Cunningham, and Kent Beck. The basic premise is that code must be simple to read (by people other than the author), easy to test, have good test coverage, etc. This is pretty obvious -and therefore I'm sure you have an innate sense of what clean code is. This book helps to reinforce this, and tells you how to get there.<br /><br />After discussing the basics of what clean code actually is, \\"Uncle\\" Bob moves on to working through the refactoring of a few different open source projects. He begins with bad code, and steps through a number of refactorings until the code is clearly much cleaner (albeit also much longer). These chapters are very easy to skip through, so you have to be sure to stick through it and really make sure you understand the reasoning behind each step.<br /><br />I'd like to quote a paragraph out of the introduction in the book which summarises precisely the importance of really thinking whilst reading this chapter. The quote goes as follows:<br /><br />\\"If you read the first and third sections and skip over the case studies, then you will have read yet another \\"feel good\\" book about writing good software. But if you take the time to work through the case studies, following every tiny step, every minute decision - if you put yourself in our place, and force yourself to think along the same paths that we thought, then you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns, practices, and heuristic. They won't be \\"feel good\\" knowledge any more. They'll have been ground into your gut, fingers, and heart. They'll have become part of you in the same way as a bicycle becomes an extension of your will when you have mastered how to ride it.\\"<br /><br />I really like this book; it was very easy to read, yet challenging and rewarding. I feel like I can read it again in a years time and learn plenty more. I really don't feel that I can offer any means in which this book can be improved. The only criticism I can level at the book is that it requires you to really invest time and effort into getting the most out of it.<br /><br />To summarise this book as succinctly as I can, this book felt like the missing chapters from `Effective Java'. After reading both books, I feel I know everything I need to know about writing top-quality Java code. In addition, I know that when I ever have a question regarding writing quality Java code that by referring to these two books I will almost certainly have an answer awaiting me. Whereas Effective Java is about teaching you the Java language and how to use it, Clean Code is focused on ensuring code is easily readable and `clean'. It does this by describing how to format and refactor bad code, and whilst a lot of what this book says is obvious (use good names, keep functions short, ensure your tests pass, etc), it's still a good read, as there are certainly ideas in this book that you may have forgotten otherwise.then you will gain a much richer understanding of those principles, patterns, practices, and heuristic.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|i wonder if it's even worth my time to write another trivium review.  trivium is one of those bands that totally divides the metal community.  some people view them as the best new band in the world, and others view them as lame pop sellouts or something.    i love how most of these reviews hinge totally on the fact that matt heafy screams on this album like he did on ascendancy.  the good reviews are all like \\"the screaming is back! this album rules!\\"  and all the bad reviews are like, \\"the screaming is back, this album sucks.\\"    i have some news for you.  metal bands are judged by more than whether or not the lead singer screams.  i can listen to both with ease, and my opinion of an album depends on the quality of that singing and/or screaming, the intelligence of the lyrics, and the actual musical ability on display.  no one should ever give a band a good or bad review solely on the style of vocals.  that's just stupid.    musically, trivium has been raising the bar ever since their first album.  listening to shogun is like a religious experience, the music is so aggressively heavy and complex.  listening to other bands, even good ones, who stick to simpler song structures and lyrical patterns, just accentuates the intensity that trivium bring to the table.  there aren't many metal bands out there that are willing to take these kinds of risks and deliver this level of musical complexity.    the first song on the album, kirsute gomen, is just incredible, with all the different directions the song goes in and the way heafy switches between clean singing and brutal growling.  its almost worth the price of the entire album.  but every song is just as good, none of them boring or \\"filler,\\" each one an epic metal masterpiece.  i would easily put them up with the epic songwriting of bands like machine head or even more \\"prog\\" metal bands like mastodon.    i've changed my mind a bit since i first reviewed the crusade a few years ago.  crusade was a great change of pacefor the band, despite what some fans think.  it was an opportunity for the band to show their creativity and ability to go beyond the repetitive metal sound.  it was a great showcase for their talent, but it was not meant to be a new direction.  shogun steers them back on track, but instead of going back to what they did on ascendancy, they pull out all the stops and blow everything they've done before out of the water.    even comparing this album to anything \\"screamo\\" or \\"nu-metal\\" or whatever genre-we-hate-of-the-month is patently absurd and shows an ignorance of what those genres actually are.  and anyone with an actual appreciation of metal MUSIC, not just screaming-vs-singing nonsense, will realize the depth of their musical ability.  shogun is one of the best metal albums in the past ten years, easily.

I must not have paid attention to the description of the book, because it was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a lovely coffee table type of book, but instead it's a small paperback and the photos are printed on regular paper and are pretty small on each page to boot. The book doesn't do the photos justice. This book will now just sit on my shelf not to be admired as I had hoped it would.    The biggest disappointment is how the photos are printed on regular paper!

B000005RQT|4.0|Recently I've been checking out bands which get dubbed the originator of heavy metal...bands like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. Have heard how Deep Purple sometimes gets given this label too, so I thought I'd check out their album which sometimes gets this distinction. To my ears, the debuts by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin don't really sound like the heavy metal I know...they're both quite rootsy, but Black Sabbath do seem to introduce lyrical themes in their debut which heavy metal will obsess over in future (occultish ideas). Led Zeppelin II do have a kind of mainstream, heavy metal type song in \\"Whole lotta love\\", however, as a whole, I don't find it particularly metal. \\"In rock\\" does sound old school metal to me, and it came out before Black Sabbath's masterpiece, \\"Paranoid\\" was released. \\"Paranoid\\" DOES sound metal, whereas their debut didn't. So, for the moment, I'll give this album the distinction of giving rise to the heavy metal sound, in an album. It must be said, that it sounds to me like Deep Purple's new lead singer on this album, Ian Gillan, had a big influence on heavy metal singing, with his glassy wailing. Maybe that is jumping the gun a bit too much, as Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin did that kind of thing on Led Zeppelin II, which came out before this album, but maybe Gillan did it in a more metal way. If you want to go back further, pop star of the 1960s, Frankie Valli did a similar sort of thing, singing wise (think \\"Rag doll\\" and \\"Dawn\\" for starters), but it took guys with the guts to transfer that style into the rock arena, like Plant and Gillan, to make it a feature of some heavy metal music. Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson comes to mind as a singer who is treading down the Plant/Gillan path, vocals wise.        Anyway, enough of that, here's what I think of this album:    Best song:    Black night - it's not on the original album, so it's a terrific bonus to get on this album. To me it sounds like that second version of this song on this cd is superior, sound quality wise. Can't say I can really tell the difference between the two versions, apart from the second version sounding crisp and fresh, as well as featuring a cool drum count in beat, which the first version doesn't have. On the cd display, the drum count in is lumped with the previous track, which I don't really appreciate.     Child in time - an original album track. A 10:18 minute long epic song. Vocally, Gillan goes down Robert Plant's route from \\"Whole lotta love\\", but he takes it to whole new level...really hits the high notes, and riding the wave all the way into the beach. Both singers really play on the highly sexualised nature of their singing. The song itself is partly an organ heavy ballad, whilst the rest is more towards heavy metal.  Deep Purple's organ sound is distinctive to them...The Doors are really the only other band that comes to mind when you think of bands utilising this instrument. One guitar solo in this song brought to mind Jimi Hendrix' style, and some of the fretwork in this song seems pure heavy metal to me, as is the drumming at times, which occasionally uses a military style rhythm, in an emphatic manner. The outro to this song is reminiscent of The Beatles. Gillan uses the phrase \\"Oh no\\" in this song, which may be referencing Black Sabbath's debut album...one of the songs off of that features the same lyric and sound, I think.    Speed king - 5:53 in length. Features a raucous intro of heavy metal sounding noodling guitar solo. The organ in this song sounds like the church variety, and later it sounds like something that The Doors would compose. Lyrically, the song cites Little Richard, and Gillan has his heavy metal defining singing going on...high pitched shrieking. The song is bassy too, and the riff sounds like modern metal. Perhaps this song could be viewed as being influential for later movements in metal like Speed and Thrash. Just guessing. The song also features the lyric \\"Come on baby, drive me crazy\\" which is, if I'm not mistaken, also a line from a KISS song (on the third version of this song on this album, Gillan's voice actually reminds me of KISS' Paul Stanley, vocally). The third version of this song might have the better sound quality to it too. The second version of this song features the piano instead of the organ. Also, the second version of this song has what sounds like the guitar mimicking a vocal part from a 1960's soul song sung by Wilson Picket, called \\"Land of a 1000 dances\\", from memory, the \\"na na na na\\" part of that song.    Bloodsucker - has a chugga chugga type riff which reminds me of Black Sabbath...but not sure if the Sabbath that it reminds me of came out before or after this song. Gillan gives his vocals a ballsy sound in this heavy metal type track. Features the organ too.    Living wreck - a catchy track with a jagged, shrieky organ sound. Bassy with some of the lead guitar work being catchy in a funky kind of way. Gillan's vocals reminded me of the lead singer of Australian rockers Baby Animals, especially their classic track \\"Rush you\\"...the lead singer of the Baby Animals is a woman! Similar vocal style though. Think the Aussie group formed in the 1980s.    Cry free - has some fast and intense drumming. The lead guitar is metaly, and the organ is featured too. Another bonus song which was not on the original album.                     The rest of the original album:    Flight of the rat - 7:55 in length. The introduction to this song makes me think it might be influential as far as guitar style and song introductions go. The song is bookended by a sort of 1950s style rock'n'roll. The guitars sound very grungy and the lead guitar breaks reminded me of AC/DC, so perhaps AC/DC were influenced in this regard by Deep Purple. In the middle of the song, there is some funky drumming, and a drum solo near the end. Bassy track too, featuring the organ. Lyrics include \\"The memory is gone\\", which has echoes in Metallica's classic song \\"The memory remains\\". The second version of this song on this album has a funky sounding guitar bit in the middle...can't remember whether the original album version has this bit.    Into the fire - heavy track with a catchy groove to it. Sometimes this song's riff reminded me of Black Sabbath's \\"Iron man\\", which would be released after this album came out.     Hard lovin' man - has very nice sounding velvety notes on the bass guitar, I think. The riff reminded me of the later classic song \\"Barracuda\\" by Heart. Heart had two female singers...they sound pretty heavy metal in their singing in that song...remarkably similar to the sound that Gillan generates with his voice, when he makes it sound glassy. The outro to the song features some pure heavy metal guitar noodling.        Lastly, the album has another bonus track in the instrumental \\"Jam stew\\" which is bassy and features lead guitar with solos.       Overall, this is a good album which is entirely listenable (I'm not talking about the bonus tracks here, which are all separated by up to around half a minute of the band or engineers chatting. No gold in that, but the bonus version tracks often sound better than the original album versions provided on this cd). The length of the original album is about 43.5 minutes, but full material on this album roughly doubles the playing time. A good album to get for seminal works in the rock music, with Gillan's genre defining vocals, and the band's distinctive brand of organ based heavy rock!
B001UV4XU6|5.0|\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is a wonderfully refreshing experience, a romantic comedy that doesn't follow the rules of a romantic comedy. It's inventive, intelligent, and engaging, a story of the dualities a young man lives with on a daily basis. On the one hand, there's the duality between falling in love and believing that love doesn't exist; Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) grew up believing in fate bringing soul mates together whereas Summer (Zooey Deschanel) grew up not believing in much of anything, least of all lasting relationships. On the other hand, there's the duality between what one would like to happen and what actually does happen; we often go through life with expectations, even though we know deep down that most will never be met. Tom is in a tug-of-war between his romantic fantasies and the reality that Summer doesn't believe in true love.    Levitt's performance is a revelation. He plays Tom with sincerity. Tom is approachable and good natured, highly confident yet not so above-it-all that he can't be desperate and miserable at times. He writes greeting cards for a living but has always dreamed of becoming an architect, and he often finds inspiration from the Los Angeles skyscrapers that surround him. His story unfolds in much the same way a memory does, with fragments that pop up all out of sequence until the reality of those 500 days become clear. Some may be confused by this, but keep in mind that memory and chronological order never go hand in hand. This is especially true when reflecting on a relationship. Tom continuously thinks back trying to make sense of it all, only to end up considering the possibility that Summer was right all along.    Deschanel, who seemed so awkward in films like \\"Yes Man\\" and \\"The Happening,\\" here is perfectly cast. Summer is charming, fun, and sweet, but she's also mysterious, distant, and casual about life. She dates Tom and even makes love to him, yet she will never see him as anything more than a friend. She's with him not because she's in love--she's just having fun while living in the moment. It's about all she can do given the fact that she can't love anything, save for the length of her hair and the fact that she can cut it off without feeling anything. There are a few select moments, however, when she connects with Tom at a more personal level, inviting him into her artsy apartment and eventually opening up about past experiences. This makes Tom feel appreciated, as he believes, perhaps correctly, that she doesn't go this far with too many people.    By the end of the film, Tom feels like someone we've gotten to know. Summer, on the other hand, remains enigmatic, underscoring the uncertainty engrained in any kind of relationship. There are times when Tom thinks he has her figured out. There are other times when it seems as if they've never even met. Loving relationships are based on compromises, and while Tom would be willing to make a few, Summer most definitely would not. She does what she wants when she wants it. This is admirable, but when matters of the heart are involved, the line does need to be drawn somewhere.    Tom's emotional roller coaster ride occasionally gets the visual treatment. In one scene, he becomes the star of a musical number featuring dancers and a cartoon bluebird. In another scene, he imagines himself as characters in black and white European art house films by Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. The single most creative shot has him standing in the middle of the street while the buildings transform into an architectural sketch, much like the one he drew on Summer's arm. Director Marc Webb treats these scenes not as showcases of special effects but as special moments of heightened reality, which is fitting given the battle waged between what Tom desires and what he actually gets. The most obvious interpretation of this theme is a split-screen image late in the film, one side marked \\"Expectations,\\" the other side marked \\"Reality.\\"    These extra touches make this movie enjoyable, but its Gordon and Deschanel that make it a joy to watch. They have chemistry. You believe in them as actual people and not merely as characters. They show just how talented they are as actors, although credit must also be given to Webb's direction and the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. They breathe life into \\"(500) Days of Summer,\\" a film we're told right off the bat is not a love story. Nor should it be; we've seen love stories before, and while they more or less work as entertaining distractions, rarely do they provide insight or even traces of plausibility. This movie is more ambitious than that. It aims to tell a story without resorting to cheap gimmicks like cliché dialogue or contrived plotlines. The end result is a story that's often funny, often thoughtful, and always compelling.

B00284BMBM|5.0|With stronger lyrics and even better melodies than on their debut album, Daughtry showcases much artistic and musical growth over the past few years.  On their sophomore effort, they worked together as a band, writing or co-writing every track.  There was no deadline so they had plenty of time to make it just how they wanted it--another success.  Leave This Town offers plenty of variety with the harder rocking \\"You Don't Belong\\" and \\"Ghost of Me,\\" the catchy pop-rock driven tracks \\"Every Time You Turn Around,\\" \\"What I Meant To Say,\\" and \\"Supernatural,\\" while still sticking to the signature sound that got them here in the first place with \\"Learn My Lesson,\\" \\"Open Up Your Eyes,\\" and the tracks, \\"No Surprise\\" and \\"Life After You,\\" co-penned by Chad Kroeger of Nickelback. Stand-out ballads include the stunning \\"September\\" and the powerful sweet-falsetto-leads-to-rocking-climax that is \\"Call Your Name.\\"  The band has created some infectious songs here, and Chris delivers again his strong, unmistakable voice. Daughtry won't stray far from the formula that made them multi-platinum-selling pop-rock Gods, as it should be.  However, they're not afraid to take creative risks with other genres, as in the country-infused \\"Tennessee Line,\\" harmonizing with Vince Gill, sure to silence juvenile remarks crying \\"Nickelback clone.\\" The listener might as well leave this disc on repeat, as it gets more addicting with every listen. Daughtry has established and fine-tuned their sound, proving why they belong in and dominate the mainstream.

0385340575|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Lee Child's novels so far; this one rates high among them.  I did find the plot a tad confusing at first, but it became clear very quickly.  As always, I wish the books could be made into a movie or TV series.  With an actor like Ray Stevenson in the part of Reacher.  I am sooooo glad Lee writes so fast;  would hate to wait a long time for a new book.  Everyone should check out his website, it has some neat stuff on it.
0743539133|3.0|I read this book after reading [[ASIN:1400064996 A. Lincoln: A Biography].  I found that though this book is well written it presents no new information.  All the inner dealings with the cabinet are all detailed just as well in the other book.  So I'm not sure what the purpose of writing this book was.  It really does not present any new or profound insight into Lincoln's cabinet.  I would reccomend reading the other book over this becuase at least the other book gives you a context for the actions of Lincoln later in his life.  You come away with a richer appreciation for the man from the other book.
B0000089FS|3.0|I recently picked up Elton John's catalog from the 80's, replacing the albums that I had back in the dark ages, and put this in the mix, remembering it as a very good album.  My memory was not what it should have been.  This is an okay album, with a few strong songs, but overall it did not work very well.  To be honest, downloading Town of Plenty, the opening cut, and \\"Since God invented girls\\", the closing cut, and you pretty much have the album.  Not as good as most of Elton's work.

B001GKJ2DE|5.0|Wanted defines the term \\"over-the-top\\". This film has some of the most ridiculous action scenes and far-fetched gunfights I've seen since The Matrix in 1999. You've got two amazing and original car chases, lots of intense and downright awesome shootouts, an engagingly deep story, and quite a few interesting characters. The actors all do a great job, especially James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman. Angelina Jolie was just there to look good and didn't do much. I highly recommend seeing this film, even if it's just for the action scenes. And if you like the film, also check out the video game: [[ASIN:B001DYXGUI Wanted: Weapons of Fate]]. It captures the feel of the film perfectly and is really fun to play.    From a collector's edition standpoint, this set is very well done. It comes with some really great special features and collector's items, such as the acrylic film cell and the lobby cards. Everything comes packaged in a solid case lined with some fancy fabric, which is house by a thick plastic sleeve with a bullet lodged in it. My only complaint is the storage of the discs. They attach to a cardboard shooting range target and just sit in the case. The discs will not get damaged or anything, it just feels awkward when removing it from the case. They should have just included a standard case to store the discs in. Other than that, the set is great and definitely worth picking up.
0446402397|4.0|Child 44 is an excellent thriller that describes life in Russia in the 1950s under Stalin. It was frightening.  The  novel opens with two children searching for food during a famine in the 1930s. One of the children disappears. The novel then jumps to the 1950's.Leo a a high ranking policeman in Moscow briefly investigates the death of a child. He dismisses it as an accidental death. The parents disagree, but they can't argue with the state. Leo then searches for a man who is considered a traitor(there's no evidence).    Next, Leo and his wife are accused of being traitors and are on the run.Leo has by this time gathered evidence that there is a serial killer of children. This a bare bones account of the story, but believe me there's so much more.  Everything comes together at the end. I never saw it coming.    Smith has written characters that I cared about. He has done a great job describing  Russia's paranoia  and suspicion of it's people during the time of Stalin.    I highly recommend this novel
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Great video/sound quailty. The DVD extras are key here, and they're great.  Interviews with the cast on set, making-off documentaries.    The best part of the extras, is the Movie Critic's commentary.  It's hilarious to listen to the Critics completely tear apart and mock Matrix 2 and 3, though they praise Matrix 1. It shows that the Wach Brothers have major cajones.    No directors commentary though.
B00275EGWO|4.0|The Hurt Locker is a very good movie.  It tells the story of a US Army bomb squad team in Iraq in 2004. All the acting is great and the story is well worth telling.  Unfortunatly you don't get sucked into the movie as much as you should.  It comes across a little like the TV show \\"COPS\\". The director is Kathryn Bigelow and after reviewing her IMDB page I can see that the problem lies squarely with her style. All the cast did a great job and just seeing the movie is a tribute to our nation's troops.
0545123267|5.0|Scholastic's answer to vampires? Werewolves.<br /><br />Lucky me, I was loaned an ARC of Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater! Shiver has a believable first-person narration, with the chapters rotating between the two main characters, Grace and Sam. Their love seems fated from the beginning and we, the readers, yearn for the two of them to be together. One slight problem...Sam is a werewolf. (NOTE: No endings are revealed in this review...)<br /><br />By allowing us to watch the unfolding of their love and the tension of the transformations through both Grace's and Sam's point of view, Stiefvater helps the reader suspend disbelief effectively. At no time does she falter in her narrative, even with elements that defy logic, her explanations of the fantastical are clear and reasonable. The chapter headings are listed with the character's name, as well as the temperature, a key element in the novel.<br /><br />As the tension builds through the novel, with elements of apprehension coming from various plot devices deftly woven in, Shiver keeps us hungering for more information and urging Grace and Sam toward a satisfying resolution. The sub-plots that thread through the novel are convincing, as well. The conflicts between Grace and her friends ring true, with family problems rounding out the issues that simultaneously bring the two together, yet drive wedges between them.<br /><br />While Stiefvater's overall story arc pulls us through the novel, the poetry of her writing makes one pause, lingering over beautifully crafted lines. The wolf imagery is entwined, running through the narrative, skillfully allowing us to enter Sam's world as he shows Grace, and us, his life in the pack.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters is when Sam takes Grace on a date to the bookstore. I'll admit it...I'm a sucker for a good bookstore. This one sounds cozy, welcoming to its reader customers, a place where customers can browse unhindered. Sam's choosing this place as a dating destination adds to his romanticism, with his painful past, soulful eyes, and love of poetry.<br /><br />There are many appeals to Shiver's well-written prose that will attract the readers Scholastic is seeking. The ending was satisfying and left only a few lingering questions, which may not bother most readers. (Perhaps a sequel is in the works?) Another key feature is that this YA novel features the total adoration by the love interest, which many young women seek. The love scenes are realistic, without being too graphic. (The only thing jarring was the beginning of the acknowledgements.)<br /><br />Overall, the tension, conflicts, and themes are all ones of high interest to teens. Combine that with great voice, imagery, and a fast-paced plot and you have a book destined for the best-seller list. There is plenty of buzz being generated about this book, with good reason. Read Shiver - let yourself be transported to a world that is both fantastical and believable. Get caught up in Grace and Sam's love. You will never look at wolves the same again.<br /><br />[...]soulful eyes, and love of poetry.

B000TIO4Z0|5.0|In an opera lover's absolutely perfect world, this set would also contain the Callas live recordings that EMI has issued over the years.  However, the 70 CD's of her studio recordings are one of the great all time bargain, given that even new, they are at a price of about $1 a CD.       Callas is one of the recorded treasures and her legacy here will give pleasure and meaning to listeners and singers.  Some of her greatest work is here - La Forza del Destino, Rigoletto - and her greatest work is opera at its best, moving, lyrical (beautiful), dramatic, and oh so intense.  To make it even more of a bargain, she is often paired here with her great colleague Tito Gobbi, who while he did not have the greatest baritone voice, could make more meaning from Verdi than any contemporary of his (with the possibile exception of Fischer-Dieskau who did not, however, have as good a VERDI voice).  And she is often conducted here by her mentor, the great opera conductor, Tullio Serafin.       My wife just had her first grandchildren so I have been in the midst of many discussions of what are good or useful or educational toys for children.  Buy them this set.  Growing up with the intensity of life Callas embodied must be good for you. It will make your sense of life and what is possible bigger.

0553582461|4.0|I've read hundreds of books in my life, but I've never been inspired to write a review until now. This book could have been the perfect ending to a great trilogy, but somehow it just didn't happen. Here's why: the Fool is leaving Fitz and everything they had together behind, so that Fitz can live the life he was always meant to have. But when the Fool comes to say goodbye, and Fitz was missing, he must have presumed him dead. The Fool has to blame himself for this, for living past his time, and causing the Catalyst to make a change that resulted in his own death. Why would Hobb have the Fool carry that burden after everything he had been through? Also, I have to confess that it has wrenched my heart from my chest that the Fool and Fitz will live out their days, never seeing each other again, and they didn't even have a farewell. The fact that Molly is Fitz's \\"happy ending\\" seemed anticlimactic to me, and a lousy reward for all he had gone through. I would still recommend reading the book however, because it was very good.

Most of the songs on this cd are extremely well written and her voice is surprisingly strong-i highly recommend this cd to anyone especially women with broken hearts or someone just coming out of a relationship-its a tear jerker and makes you assess your own mistakes and faults!

B001SAQVSQ|5.0|This book is one of his better ones- along with The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Brown Bear Brown Bear.  The repitition of \\"She was very busy spinning her web\\" creates a rhythm to the story, the pictures of the animals on the farm are very beautiful and the ending is lovely.  Yes- it's not a thrilling book but it is soothing and a great bedtime book because of its cadence and its culmination.  My 13 month daughter has loved this one since being a few weeks old- she calms down and watches very intently and now is interested in touching the texture of the web in the book.
B00006JMQG|5.0|The DVD that I watched is the Kino version.  I must say that I found the intensity of the blue highlights around the figures in the very first scene in the garden very exaggerated, but did not dislike it, rather I thought it was painterly way of representing the scene. I read in the reviews here that this is a distortion that does NOT appear in the Image version of the film, so I will make a point of getting that one for comparison purposes.     The musical score feature offers two choices. Go for the traditional, the modern version does not work as well and eventually becomes very annoying.    The film is an excellent example of how the artistic currents and tendencies of the time were affecting film and each media was influencing the other. The images in the movie most certainly reminded me of paintings that I have admired by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, particularly 4 paintings that show urban landscapes and figures, all done before the movie when the artist lived in Berlin: Nollendorfplatz, 1912 Berlin Street Scene, 1913  Potsdamer Platz, 1914  Brandenburger Tor, 1915   also the angularity of the architecture reminded me of the style of Franz Marc and August Macke's workks, both of them were great Expressionist painters that died very young and are even less well known than Kirchner. All of them portrayed the anxiety,dehumanization, and sheer horror that 'modern' life was providing for the regular urban dweller of those difficult  times in Germany, but that eventually became emblematic of the phenomenon worldwide. There is a famous coloured woodcut by another Expressionsit artist, Erich Heckel, Portrait of a Man, from 1919 that is the very face of Cesare, (played by Conrad Veit) the character that plays the murderous somnambulist in the film, it is tempting to think that the could have been the model. The makeup worn by Lil Dagover who plays Jane is very similar to the women portrayed by expressionistic artist Karl Schmidt-Rottluff.    Also do note that the shadow projected on to the wall as Cesare approaches, then murders his first victim, is a device that we are going to see again, with similar horrific implications in \\"Nosferatu\\" just two years later.  The device of using a story within a story, whereby at the very end we are led to believe that the whole thing has been an invention of Francis' deranged mind as we see that he, along with Jane and Cesare are patients of Caligari at a real-life assylum is straight from Kafka in sensibility.    This is a must see movie for all interested in the German Expressionist movement, but also for horror/thriller fans, as this movieis the parent of the genre. Aside from the historical or artistic merits, it is still a very interesting, fascinating movie and not at all a museum relic. We get drawn into the weird, fantastical and claustrophobic world of Dr. Caligari and can not wait for the next scene to advance the plot. It benefits immensely from the absence of dialogue, as the intensity of the characters, and the effectiveness of the decor are more than well suited to convey all the significance we need. It truly is a perfect example of why silent movies are still important and relevant as independent works of art .    One of the extra features is a 'condensed' 43 minute long version of  \\"Genuine the tale of a Vampire\\", which I also enjoyed watching. It has similar sets and backdrops to Caligari.The plot revolves around a femme fatale (played by Fern Andra to the hilt and 'edge' of what was then known as vampism) called Genuine who is not a vampire as the title may suggest, but actually  had been the high priestess of some cult.     She ends up in a slave market featuring surprising revealing nudity, and is eventually bought by an eccentric old man who is prone to  doze off while being shaved daily, and who keeps the girl as a decorative souvenir in his mansion, as one can not possibly imagine his senility could be aroused to more action than admiring looks of worship. Whether the priestess arrived from a past life or the 'exotic' Middle East of 19th Century literature, is not clear.    The first time we see Genuine she steps-off a portrait in the sitting-room, wearing an outrageous costume more pertaining to Hollywood High Drama than any epoch of antiquity, while gesturing an walking in an uncannily similar way to  Gloria Swanson descending the staricase in the very last scene of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" where she believes she is Salomé in a De Mile epic. As an added feasture to the convoluted plot, the elderly gentleman has an Afro- Arabian servant, with painted bare chest, which looks like an unemployed extra from Diaghelev's Ballet Russe.    The barber and another young man, a nephew? of the elder gentleman, are somehow driven mad with sudden-first-sight catastrophic passion for this creature. She appears with each one in such fantastical, bizarre costumes one would assume they both had a fetish for circus performers, while we also understand why some birds surely went extinct at this time with such lavish use of feathers. The barber cuts the older man's throat because she suggests it as a sacrifice to their love and then wants him to commit suicide as another proof of love... the details aren't very clear - particularly with respect to the old man's nephew or her relationship to the servant, that can be controlled with a 'magical' ring. At some point one of them rouses the populace against her in a frenzy by calling her a witch. They rush in a fury and attack and trample the Nubian at the doorstep of the mansion,  and in a scene which basically duplicates Cesare's fate from Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, she dies in the ensuing fracas after what looks like a short interpretative dance sequence.     I would have preferred a burning at the stake myself as a happier ending. However the movie would probably make more sense in the full version. The costume changes that Genuine undergoes for every single scene are worth every second of watching this oddity. Ms. Andra gave camp lovers (and drag queens)  a solid and fertile basis for future developments with her showmanship, and at some moments in her performance she very much reminded me of the late Charles Busch in his Ridiculous Theater's production and interpretation of  Gustave Flaubert's \\"Salambó\\", where he played the priestess to perfection in one of the most enchanting and absolute comical masterpieces of Contemporary theater that I was lucky enough to have seen, and remember always for its artistic and hilarious brilliance.
B001E57SH8|5.0|I purchased a colibri lighter a while back.  It worked ok for the first day.  After that it almost never lit.  I was very disappointed and bought an original Zippo.  I fell in love with it.  However, eventually I got sick of tasting the Zippo lighting fluid when I smoked cigars, so I began searching for a higher quality butane lighter.  I finally ran across the Zippo Blu.  Saw it has a lifetime warranty and figured it was worth a try. The Zippo Blu works wonderfully.  Lights anything very quickly with a very consistent flame.  Also has a window on the side to view the amount of butane in its tank.  On a side note to those who say the lighter wont light, make sure the screw used to replace the flint is fully tightened.  If it isn't the butane will not release when you press down on the wheel, making it very difficult to light.     Pros:  hot, consistent flame.  Reliable lighting mechanism.  Classic Zippo design. Life time warranty  Cons:  No way to adjust the height of the flame. If the butane level in the window is below half, the butane will RARELY light.  The butane runs out fairly quickly, but based on other reviews, this is common among butane lighters.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|Looked at in the whole of his work, Russell T. Davies used his run as executive producer of Doctor Who (2005-2008) to expand the universe surrounding the Time Lord.  Using the Doctor Who anthology as a jumping off point, Davies was able to build the premise that brought Elizabeth Sladen back into the Family of Time as a more mature Sarah Jane Smith...and through the first two series of Doctor Who, built the foundation that led to Torchwood; using \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" , \\"The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances\\" and \\"Bad Wolf/Parting Of The Ways\\" from Series One; then \\"Tooth And Claw\\" and \\"Army of Ghosts/Doomsday\\" for establishing the hows and whys for the Institute.     It's obvious that the BBC decided that that, in spinning off one of the characters from a reimaging of The Doctor, the one that HAD to be spun off was Jack Harkness.  As portrayed by John Barrowman, Captain Jack was too handsome, too tragically heroic, too charismatic...and too adventurous (Both in his work and his off hours) to NOT have a storyline built around him.  In many ways, Captain Jack is another vision of the Doctor; sort of an off-kilter reflection that one might see in a Hall of Mirrors.  Jack is immortal but wishes for death, a leader who demands his team follow his leadership yet keeps secrets of his past (Their future) from them...Barrowman has matured Jack from his introduction...SOME.  Certainly, he is a more severe and understanding human in Cardiff than he was during his time on the TARDIS...and this plays out over the 13 episodes.     Barrowman's equal in this series is the brilliant Eve Myles as the police constable turned Torchwood police liaison Gwen Cooper.  Cooper, a descendant of the housemaid Gwyneth from \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" (Something that was retconned in Series Four of Doctor Who), observes Torchwood reanimate a corpse in the series opener (\\"Everything Changes\\"), and begins a winding trail to--oddly enough--becoming somewhat of a \\"Companion\\" to Jack.  Myles is an oddly attractivewoman--once she gets out of the PC uniform and into regular clothing, she has a wonderful body with that odd gap between the front of her upper teeth--which somehow makes her more human and appealing.  Gwen's adjustment to working at Torchwood--the sequence in \\"Ghost Machine\\" in which Jack teaches her how to user firearms--makes Gwen almost seem a natural for the unique mission of Torchwood.       The rest of the Torchwood team--the medical specialist Owen Harper (Given an angry, arrogant edge by Burn Gorman--at least until \\"Out Of Time\\"), the computer/systems specialist Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori, played as a bit of a wallflower save \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\"; in which we find out she holds a torch for Owen) and the administrative specialist Ianto Jones (Gareth Lloyd-Davies, who never seems to have a hair out of place or his suit out of joint--well, except for \\"Cyberwoman\\" and \\"Countrycide\\") round out Torchwood Three.          Torchwood is a series that delves into the seamier side of Doctor Who's world.  The basic premise of the Torchwood Institute--a first line of defense on Earth against aliens (Aliens in this case defined as beings from other planets AND dimensions in time and space) allows for the issues that might inhabit any law-enforcement unit--relationships (How Gwen cannot tell her boyfriend, Rhys Williams, what she does...or as the season goes on, who she's sleeping with), the usage of what the team garners through the rift, and the potential for corruption from those items.  This is the theme of the first episode, in which the usage of one of the items...and it's corruptive, corrosive nature...leads to the death of one member of the team...and opens up the spot that Gwen fills.  From then on, the season veer wildly--aliens consuming bodies during sex, devices opening portals to the past, cannibals, fairies that aren't all sweet and nice, mind reading devices...oh yeah, and demons looking to consume all life.     Overall, Torchwood is a wonderfully different take on the Whoniverse.  It is at times sadder, a little more visceral, and definitely more intense.  Barrowman and Myles give the series a heft and weight that couldn't be displayed in Doctor Who.  But that weight and intensity is why Davies gave this series a run...and it works.     Highly recommended.

B001FB55H6|5.0|I am not a fanboy of the Watchmen graphic novel, and I really had no clue what to expect from this movie when I rented it a few days ago.  This film never caught my attention well enough to move me to see it in theaters, but I thought I would give it a shot on rental.  One thing that is clear from the beginning is that this is no ordinary superhero comic story.  The characters inhabiting the role of a \\"hero\\" in this film are real people who are dealing with various inner demons.  It is this quality in the character development that grabbed my attention and caused me to feel for what these people have gone through.  Having not seen the original theatrical release, I can't respond to what new footage has been added to the director's cut.  What I can say is that I quickly fell in love with this story and could really empathize with the characters and all of their flaws.  Most other superhero stories have characters who don't seem to live a 'normal' life.  That is not the case here.  Each character in this story has an interesting backstory that fleshes them out and makes them appealing to the viewer.  This is more than a story about comic book heros, it's a story of how people with superhuman capabilities have dealt with problems in their lives, and how it has affected them years down the road.<br /><br />The one thing I wanted to bring to the reader's attention is the Maximum Movie Mode feature exclusive to Blu-ray.  While it may not be the most creative name for a BD feature, it has got to be the coolest thing I have seen yet on any BD title.  This is no mere Picture-in-picture feature.  The director Zach Snyder will periodically pop in to comment on the action on the screen.  When he does this, the movie screen moves to the left side, a new pop up screen appears on the right, and the director interacts with the two pointing out interesting details.  This feature incorporates storyboards, comic comparisons, making-of clips, and a timeline contrasting events in our history to events as they appear in the alternate reality of Watchmen.  I've seen other pic-in-pic features before, some good and some not so good, but I have never seen one as informative and enjoyable as this one.  Having the director of the film right there to actually point to images on the screen and give his take on what was happening is a treat for any film buff.  This special feature alone moved me to go out and buy the disc in order to be able to thoroughly enjoy every aspect of the Maximum Movie Mode.  I hope that other studios will pay attention to what Mr. Snyder and Warner have done with Blu-ray technology.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|Film rate: ***** out of 5    The movie is great, it's a very rare, different piece of work. Of course it's violent but it needs to be, the violence is justified anyway, the justification is certainly not an excuse... and the result is not that violent because it's always tempered with much empathy and emotion. And Laugier's direction is close to perfection.      DVD rate: ** out of 5    As a French citizen I have the original French version of this film and I can say this version released for North America and UK is NOT complete. There are many plans missing, especially during the painful bathtub scene, with the mask.  Actually the film's been cut from the beginning to the ending, with a great number of short bloody plans been taken away so nobody (especially in the US) can really notice.  Another thing, the dubbing on this English DVD is very bad, making the two girls sound hysterical, kind of out of their heads, when they're not. So I'll advise you to watch the film in its original French version.    And if you wanna check the complete version of the movie, with a complete image (because the image's been slightly reduced too), get the French DVD release on amazon.fr. There won't be no subs but what the hell... enjoy!

B001TW69J4|5.0|This cd is amazing, stunning, and all around perfect. It is progressive the way progressive should be. It is loud and quiet, never pretenscious, and always beautiful.<br /><br />The cd starts off slamming you in the eye with a meshuggah-esque time signature and guitar riff, but thats as far as the comparison goes. Before you know you've hit some plain of metal jazz/fusion that sounds almost like a totally different cd, but it works. The music transitions into so many varying degrees of tempo and style that it's hard to keep up, but it's always tasteful. I simply can't find enough to say about the cd. Surelly the most important aspect is the guitars. This band layers metal riffs over AND under clean guitar, sometimes almost sounding like funk-style stuff, but it stays true to the original intention of the song. The drummer is no less important, but I only say the guitar is more important because this drummer needs to follow whatever the heck he is doing 24/7. This is where the drumming is amazing though. He plays a style very much like the drummer of Meshuggah in the metal sections but soon shows his chops via the more quiet elements and jazz sections. He is incredibly capable of playing anything, because he almost HAS to on this cd. The time signatures are just wrong at times and I have to say I find myself enthralled by his cymbal play when combined with his unbelievably well-controlled and independent bassdrum work.<br /><br />Everything about this band has to be heard to truelly understand any of what I just said. Bands like Canvas Solaris are great and they have wonderful ideas, but they never quite coalesce into the song structure that this band seems to fully comprehend. They write such ludacris material that takes nothing short of virtuoso skill to play most of the time, but it doesn't push itself into the territory of over-the-top. If you love anything progressive, particularly beautiful guitarwork, whether it's acoustic or heavy-handed electric work, you will find something to please. I give this a perfect score, hands down 5/5. I'm going to be busy prying my jaw off the floor, I'll help with yours when I'm done.<br /><br />Edit: At the time I wrote this I had no clue Abasi programmed the drums and now my mind is blown even more. In a recent interview the band revealed that NO ONE in the band currently had more than a year of formal trianing between them. That alone should blow anyone's mind when they hear Abasi's work on this cd. He is, without a doubt, on the same wavelength as a Satriani, Morse, or Glibert.ng to please.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I came into the Breaking Bad series towards the end of Season One and was so taken by it that I had to order the full season.  This is the tale of a high school chemistry teacher turning his scientific skills into a profitable drug-making operation in order to finance his expensive cancer treatments.  He enlists the help of a former student to market the resulting product.  Along the way, they encounter violence, close calls (his brother-in-law is a DEA agent), and some hilarious missteps.     This is a very well-crafted series with fascinating characters, all portrayed by excellent actors.  Season Three is coming up. If you watch it once, you'll be hooked!
B000063DIR|1.0|This is really pathetic. By taking a great album and stripping out the original rhythm section, they sucked out all the chemistry of the original players -- Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake -- and, as if that weren't enough, put on inferior re-recordings that don't even do the music justice. I HATE this \\"remaster\\"!    Memo to Sharon and Ozzy: You're loaded now. Cut the crap, negotiate in good faith and reinstate the original mix. You've not only done a disservice to fans and newcomers with this sorry excuse for a remaster, but you've in effect committed fraud. Nowhere on the outer CD tray card or cover does it say that the music's been rerecorded; in other words, you have to buy it to find out. You both ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
B001FB55H6|4.0|The 1985 graphic novel of Watchmen by comic book great Alan Moore is one of the most impressionable pieces of literature that I've read in years. And Zack Snyder's movie interpretation is one of the few films that I've ever seen that kept so closely true to the book.<br /><br />Is Watchmen a movie about superheroes? Actually, I believe that the characters prefer \\"costumed adventurers\\" instead of superheroes...with the exception of one character in particular. The difference between superhero and costumed adventurer here is the difference between super-powers and plain old bravery and smarts. And just plain old bravery and smarts can't protect you from a bullet or a stronger man (or woman).<br /><br />So when one of the approximately five still practicing costumed adventurers called The Comedian is murdered, Rorschach, a tough, shifting-ink-blot mask wearing anti-hero makes it his business to find the killer and warn the other adventurers of a villain potentially bent on getting rid of the remaining \\"masks\\".<br /><br />I mentioned earlier \\"an exception\\" to the costumed versus super-powered adventurers...that exception is Dr. Manhattan. The question is not what can Dr. Manhattan do that's so special; the question is, what can't he do? So with a guy like Manhattan on your side...whether it's literally \\"your\\" side or say \\"your county's\\" side, ya can't lose, right?<br /><br />But what if Dr. Manhattan decided to skip town for a while? Yeah. Exactly. You guessed it. Like if Tiger Woods left golf for a season due to injury...who'd watch golf anymore? Who'd watch the Watchmen?<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend the novel over the movie, but what else is new? That's always the case with novels turned movies. The ending of the movie mirrors the novel with bit of a change and even makes a bit more sense as the twists and turns of a diabolical plot are unveiled. But as I said earlier, this minor alteration in the integrity of the story originally told by Alan Moore in graphic novel form does really not affect the brilliance of the original concept.<br /><br />If you don't have the time for the novel, this 3-hour Director's Cut is a wonderful alternative...not just for comic book and graphic novels fans, but for fans of Truth, Justice and the American Way! Add this to your cart.brilliance of the original concept.

1596061669|5.0|I have never written a review before ... but I just can't stop thinking about this book.  I have to agree with the first reviewer, this IS a spectacular collectible edition.  And the story is even better.  I won't go on about the story as many already have addressed that, I can only add that Zafon has a way of pulling you into the story and before long I was  living it.  This is now my all time favorite book and will treasure it and read it many times.  Thank you Zafon
0743298039|5.0|When I wasn't reading this book, I was thinking about it. When I was reading  it, I was completely mesmerized. Heartbroken when the book ended. I loved the elegant writing, strong characters, incredible story that was neither hokey or over-played.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|These are wonderful. Beautiful finish, gorgeous quality. Big sizes are easy to handle for little hands. Lots of interesting shapes and designs. My toddler like the \\"hat\\" the best. Made in Germany.    They aren't cheap but don't look like it either. This is an heirloom quality set that will last forever. I love that you can buying interesting expansion sets, colors, and the ball and track set. Worth the money.
0440238153|5.0|I just finished this book yesterday, and I bought it for my Kindle. I absolutely love it. Yes the ending is sad with Will and Lyra. But you know what's got to happen and they prove what they are capable of. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first two. I still have to read the prequel and I want to read the two after this about Lyra's life when she is growing up and some of her adventures with Pan afterward. I am awed by this series. It has done so much for me. And now I wish I could go to other worlds. ;) A must buy for real!
0060555661|5.0|Warren Buffett has described \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" as by far the best book on investing ever written. Graham notes that the \\"intelligence\\" the title of the book celebrates is not of the smart or shrewd types but relates more to the character of the investor that is, not someone looking for a quick profit, but with a long - term view minded to conserve their capital, who can be firm about their investing principles in the face of an emotion - driven market. Within the Graham framework of value and safety, there is room to be either a defensive or an aggresive investor.Graham's guiding rule for the conservative investor is to keep a split or roughly 50% of their funds in high grade bonds (or saving accounts with an equivalentinterest rate), and 50% in large, prominent, financially conservative companies that have a history of continuous dividend payment and whose price is not more than 25 times annual earnings (this generally excludes all growth stocks). The conventional wisdom is that if you are prepared to take higher risks, you will get higher returns. Graham rejects this, saying that high returns are not necesarily related to risk but to putting more time and effort into your investing. And finally, Graham contends that everything changes, including companies, regulations and the economy, but people do not, and people are what drive markets.
B000FC1192|5.0|I first wanted to read this book because I love Neil Gaiman's work. I read Stardust before and MirrorMask. And both of those I enjoyed. I know that when I found out about the \\"Other Mother\\" I didn't like her one bit. But Coraline proves herself and finds out how to bring her family back together. I enjoyed the whole storyline and how everything came together. I bought the movie yesterday and loved it! Coraline with her blue hair and the cat's voice was so cool to hear. I love imagining what things will be like on film because once you see it you think that is just how I pictured it. One of the best reads. :)
B002BNKQDK|5.0|this is quite possibly one of my favorite movies. and i love the night owl ship case. i was looking for a display piece for the movie but found most models and statues extremely expensive. this is awesome. i'm about to dive into the special features now. buy this. love it!    i am wondering though, if this is amazon exclusive why would they put a price tag of $119 if they will never sell it for that much? just seems weird.    and the ship freaks out my wife's cats. added bonus.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This is a very frustrating gadget.  I have gotten most of it's functionality to work, but it has been a challenge, and key pieces remain unworkable.  Here are the problems I ran into:    1.  It defaulted into Russian.  Try doing an initial configuration in Russian.  There are no entries in the manuals on how to change the language, and the on-board menu system doesn't help when you can't read it.    2.  The quick launch instructions give outdated information--e.g. the URL given to download the software for your PC to work with the watch is completely wrong.    3.  I have been unable to get the watch to synch with the foot pod for pacing information etc.  They don't work together.    4.  The watch still will not synch up with my PC.  They sense eachother, communicate initially, attempt to transfer information, then it flashes \\"Failed.\\"  It tries again every couple of minutes they are within range of each other.  This is a common problem.  If you do a Google search you will find hundreds of others with this problem--with some esoteric solutions that work for some and not for others.  None of them work for me.    5.  Tech support.  Tech support is unresponsive.  You can stay on hold for as long as you like, but nobody will ever answer.  This is very frustrating.      6.  It is hard to read, and hard to manipulate when you are running.  Some of the readouts are too small, and the touch dial is difficult to operate, when you are in motion.    7.  It is bulky and heavy.  I thought it would be thinner and lighter.  I was surprised when I put it on.  It felt like it was from the 1980s.    Total for the watch, heart monitor, and foot pod was about $450.00.  That is a lot of money for a piece of junk, which is what this is when the major functions don't work, the functions that do work are hard to use when you are using it (i.e. when running), and you can't get any help from their support.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Huge home run.  Movie is humorous, tough, and tender at the same time. Brilliant script.  Eastwood hits all the right notes.  A story with character that isn't totally PC, but certainly sends the right message veiled in a devil may care heroine.  There isn't a wasted scene in the movie.  If the language puts people off, they never spent much time with their grandfather or great uncle.  Much less about rascism or violence than I expected and firmly focused on love, loss, and purpose.  Easily one of the year's best movies.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|No problems.  I have a 13\\" Macbook Pro (mid-2009) and a 24\\" 1080p Gateway monitor on my wall.  It just works.  No complications or special instructions.  That's really all that you need to know, right?
0307341569|3.0|Is this book well written?  Yes.  But, I'm not a big fan of the book itself.  I'd rather give it a 3.5 stars because I'm on the fence.  Instead of giving you a synopsis like everyone else, let me give you my opinion.<br />First, I sent this to my MIL to read before sending it to me (I live over seas).  She reads nearly a book a day and enjoys reading.  She said she couldn't get past the first page.  What?  Never heard her say that before.  Turns out, the tone of the book is extremely dark and semi-depressing.  If you aren't into that type of book...stay away from Dark Places.<br />I did have a hard time getting into the characters.  They all are either depressed, angry, or psychotic.  This makes the book entirely too unbelievable for me.  I also had to skip a couple of pages on the sacrificing of cows; it was just too detailed for me.<br />What I did like about the book: I loved how the book was set up.  Libby in the present day then a chapter on her mom or her brother back on the day of the murders, then back to Libby in the present day.  It really kept my interest peeked.  I also liked how it was original; characters that aren't exactly likeable but yet interesting and kept wanting to know more about them.<br />After reading it, I told my husband how it ended and he gave me the look like \\"You are kidding me?\\"  Now that I think about it, yeah it's absurd.  Interesting ending while reading about it but when you look back at it you think that it's just not possible.  So, if you like realistic Who Done It? books, this may not be for you.
B001IF252M|5.0|No complications or special instructions.  I bought it to hook my 13\\" Macbook Pro (mid-2009) to my 40\\" Samsung 1080p LCD TV.  Works just like it should.  I know some people are having a hard time pairing new macbooks with Samsungs using these adapters, but luckily I was not one of them!  If you need it, just buy it.
0930289234|5.0|What makes this story so great is that it makes superheroes very human. A member of the team tries to sexually rape the other. You got a hero who is murder while another fears that the radiation which gave him his power is giving others cancer. There is another who is basically a psycho, but a very deteremined detective. Every character in the story has some major flaws, either from their doing or others doing it to them.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about the story is that it doesn't ever take the easy way out. The \\"villain\\" was kind of predictable, but the person's motives for they did took me by surprise a little. There were some parts that I didn't care for, mainly the comic in the comic storyline. I ended up skipping past a lot of what was said because it destracted me from the real story. The story is also very adult, filled with exciting violence, sex and sophisticated words I didn't even understand sometimes.<br /><br />Overall, I give the story a five out of five. It is compelling enough for me to read the entire thing in about a day. Even though this is a graphic novel, almost 500 pages is still a lot of reading!
0760750807|4.0|i seriously dig these pocket editions of the classics. this is probably something close to what it was originally published as, for the masses.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I honestly didn't know if I'd care for Mamma Mia! I'd read the muscial reviews and was familiar with the songs. I'd gotten a kick out of reading of people dancing in the aisles during the film and thought the whole thing of stringing Abba's greatest hits together was a little cheesy. I decided to watch the movie for lack of something better to do. I'm quite ill and have been bedridden since Nov. 2008.     Much to my surprise, I found the movie a joy to watch, not to mention Meryl Streep. The songs seemed to fit together seemlessly as though they were specifically written for the film, and everybody looked like they were having a wonderful time. What I liked about Mamma Mia the most is that it made me feel good. That says quite a lot, considering  most of the time I am in severe pain and nobody knows exactly why and what to do about it, as well as all the other uncertain things that are occurring in our lives.    The colors are brilliant, the water just gorgeous. I don't usually watch a movie more than once in a while, except for a few like Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice and definitely prefer the serious dramas, but I am delighted that I decided to take a chance on Mamma Mia. :) (I've tried to watch for typos, but my vision is very poor, so forgive me)
B000089CJI|4.0|really enjoyed this album when it came out and still enjoy it to this day. \\"the district sleeps tonight\\" is one of the better tracks. of course \\"great heights\\" is probably the most popular single off the album.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I bought the re-mastered Presto to replace my old CD and I can't believe the difference in sound quality between the two.  This album has by far benefitted the most in the Rush re-master series.  Adam Ayan has done magic to this magical album.  Alex's guitar has been separated from the synthesizers, which now seem to play a much more minor role in the album's sound.  Getty's bass is now audible on all tracks and the professor's drum kit has been brought front and center, giving the entire album a more spatial, stereophonic sound.    I heard music on this album that I didn't know was there.  You can hear Getty play a nice little bass riff at 2:40 in Chain Lightning, and his string picking behind the piano chords at the intro to Available Light is beautiful.  In War Paint, you can now hear Neil hit probably every drum head in his kit.  The bass kick drum can now be felt in every song, a fundamental requirement in rock music as Neil himself has said.  I've always listened to Rush because I enjoyed their virtuoso musicianship.  Singing and lyrics were always second to me.  However, while listening to The Pass on this album, I heard two phrases in a way I never had before.  You can hear vibrato in Getty's voice during the phrase, \\"Nothing's what you thought it would be...\\" that makes the vocal soar across the music.  And his unaccompanied, \\"Christ, what have you done?\\" literally jumps out of the song and smacks you between the eyes.    The re-mastered Presto is like a whole new album for me and I would recommend it to any Rush fan who classifies themselves as not a fan of Rush's middle period.  Now, if only we could get Ayan to re-master Vapor Trails, a great album that sounds like it was mastered inside a garbage can.  Are you listening Atlantic?
0760748675|4.0|reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!
630542845X|1.0|Trite, sappy, and predictable. You can see the plot coming a mile away. Hackneyed screenplay. Average acting at best. Don't bother
0316017922|4.0|This is my first book from this author and this book came highly recommended.  It did not disappoint.  This book is littered with plenty of examples of patterns of success which is not all just 'smarts' and 'family' but a combination of many factors.  This is a great illustration for anyone to understand at least in part why some are 'successful' (and make decisions which impact that success).<br /><br />The best thing out of this book is how 'success' is defined and will make you think of your own 'success' in life and fortune.
1591391105|3.0|I felt this book provided positive, solid advice on how to create your image and new role.  I feel a person new to management or working in their first job would best benefit from this book.  For someone who has been in the workplace for a while, perhaps not so much as alot of it is common sense, but common sense you gain from life experiences.  I would actually rate it a 5 for new managers, and not consider it too helpful for those with experience.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|After releasing ten films under the banner of `Star Trek', along with four television spin-offs, the novelty of this once proud brand name appeared to be wearing off. This in light of the fact that the latest entries for both mediums met with less than stellar critical and commercial success (\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" and TV's \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" respectively). It seemed that perhaps the franchise and its audience needed a break, and possibly a fresh, new approach if it was to ever find success again. Which brings us to the here and now, the summer of 2009, seven years after the last feature film and four years since the last TV spin-off aired its final episode, and we finally have a new \\"Star Trek\\" film once more boldly going where no man has gone before. Under the care of wunderkind producer, writer and director J.J. Abrams (TV's \\"Lost\\" and \\"Mission: Impossible 3\\"), along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman (\\"Transformers\\"), the dormant franchise has been resurrected, returning it to bask in the glory of critical praise and commercial success, an achievement that has been absent from the franchise for quite some time.    \\"Star Trek\\" focuses, once again, on the Federation starship Enterprise and its original crew of Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), and more. When a deadly new Romulan menace, led by a vengeful despot named Nero (Eric Bana), threatens the entirety of the Federation, Starfleet must rally its forces, including the recently completed Enterprise, to combat this alien danger before it's too late.    As a fan of the majority of the \\"Star Trek\\" films (aside from \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" and \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\"), and generally enjoying the direction the latter films had been taking (\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" being my favorite entry thus far), I was a little unsure about the prospect of essentially restarting the franchise from scratch. However, since this approach has proven successful over the last few years with other franchises that I enjoy, for example the Batman and James Bond series', I thought that if in fact the well had run dry in regards to further adventures set beyond the events of the tenth film, then perhaps this decision may work out alright after all. Of course that success would all depend on who was going to be responsible for taking the series back to its roots, so to speak.    Let me say that any lingering doubts or concerns I had in regards to this film and its chances for success were quickly laid to rest when word was released that writer/director/producer J.J. Abrams would be helming this installment. Abrams had proven himself quite the capable writer and producer with his various television projects and screenplays, so I knew that he would most likely not sit idly by if the story was lacking in any way. Yet, it was his work helming the very entertaining, third \\"Mission: Impossible\\" film that gave me even greater faith in his ability to guide the Enterprise back into the spotlight once more.    On top of the fact that such a multi-talented person of J.J. Abrams' caliber would be directing the eleventh entry into the venerable series, was the announcement that the series would not only serve as a reboot of sorts, but it would still recognize the films that have come before it; instead of just ignoring them altogether which is what most of the reboots have done. Crafting this epic story was the writing duo of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman, along with Abrams, were sensible enough to not only cater to the hardcore fans of the show and its subsequent movies and television spin-offs, but also make the story accessible to a whole new generation of moviegoers that may not have been previously interested in anything related to `Star Trek'.    The plot of \\"Star Trek\\" meets all the necessary criteria for the making of a massive summer blockbuster. Featuring plenty of drama, intensity, humor,incredible action and visual effects, and even a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure, this film has a little something for virtually every possible member of the audience. For the newcomers to the series, the story doesn't require you to have seen, or have any previous knowledge of the other films in the series. The film takes an appropriate amount of time to introduce you to all of the primary players in the film, giving them each their moment or two to shine. So, if you are unfamiliar with these iconic characters you soon won't be, once the incredibly fast-paced two hours of this film are through with you.    Now, don't fret any of you die hard fans out there that may not have seen this film yet, although I doubt there are all that many of you left that this statement could apply to at this point. There are plenty of insider references to previous events or famous quotes from your favorite characters for you to latch onto. Even though this film was made in a way that it could appeal to a much broader spectrum of the audience, it never faltered from supplying the core fan base with plenty of sci-fi goodness for them to embrace along the way. So, make no mistake, this entry into the ever-expanding Star Trek universe is a film that is completely deserving of carrying on the legacy of this epic series, and it never once loses sight of that responsibility.    Speaking of responsibility to the series' legacy, keeping these iconic characters alive is an all-new bunch of actors chosen to embody them in their younger years. This is no small feat when considering these roles were made famous many years ago by a talented and beloved cast of actors and actresses. Winning over the hearts and minds of new fans of the series shouldn't be all that hard for this cast; however, proving to the longtime fans of the franchise, some dating all the way back to the original series, may prove much harder to accomplish.    Leading the cast are two talented actors, Chris Pine(\\"Smokin' Aces\\") and Zachary Quinto (TV's \\"Heroes\\"), portraying the coveted roles of Kirk and Spock respectively. Chris Pine brings a normal speech pattern to Kirk, opting not to emulate William Shatner's pause-ridden pattern of speech; however, Chris did retain Kirk's sense of humor, arrogance, and no-quit attitude. His performance provides audiences with a new interpretation to the character while remaining true to the heart and soul of Kirk. For Zachary Quinto his portrayal of Spock was partially achieved before he ever read a single line of dialogue because he bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Leonard Nimoy (who had portrayed the character in the previous incarnation). Out of the entire ensemble cast, Quinto is probably the brightest spot in the group, as his performance is absolutely perfect for the character. Even though his performance so closely resembles that of his predecessor's, he never once ventures into the realm of imitation as so many other actors may have been tempted to do.    Supporting the two leads, is quite the gifted ensemble of actors and actresses ranging from Simon Pegg (\\"Hot Fuzz\\"), Karl Urban (\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\"), John Cho (Harold from the `Harold and Kumar' films), Zoe Saldana (\\"Vantage Point\\"), and Anton Yelchin (\\"Teminator: Salvation\\"). Simon Pegg brings a much more hilarious approach to the brilliant engineer known as Montgomery Scott, best known as Scotty, that some may find distracting due to his character being more stoic in previous appearances. However, since this film takes place at a time in the character's life that hasn't been explored, I for one view this as an acceptable revision. Karl Urban, much like Zachary Quinto, gives an almost pitch-perfect portrayal of Dr. McCoy. I found it interesting to see that as brilliant a doctor as McCoy was in the previous films, we get to see a slightly inexperienced version of him here, while he's still incredibly smart, he does make mistakes and isn't nearly as sure of his decisions as he is later on. John Cho and Zoe Saldana don't really get to break all that much new ground with their characters, Sulu and Uhura, yet the two young talents do get a few moments to shine within the film. Most notably for fans of the original series, the various hints to Sulu's sword fighting abilities are finally showcased allowing a new, more action-oriented side of the character to emerge. The only slight problem that I have with the casting is that perhaps Anton Yelchin was slightly mis-cast as Pavel Chekov. While he brings the character's trademark substitution of w's for v's out in almost every line of dialogue he has, he doesn't strike me as a good fit for the character. Even with that complaint, Anton did do a good job as Chekov; I just don't see him ever becoming the man we all know.    Rounding out the cast is veteran character actor Bruce Greenwood (\\"I, Robot\\") and Eric Bana (\\"Hulk\\"). Bruce Greenwood portrays the original captain of this starship Enterprise named Christopher Pike. He's a seasoned veteran of Starfleet, who expects nothing but excellence from all who serve under his command. Greenwood's portrayal of Pike reminds me of Captain Kirk in the previous films, where he was much more reserved and in control of every situation, never willing to sacrifice others for a mission that he wasn't willing to undertake himself. As for Eric Bana who plays the vengeful Romulan known as Nero, he wasn't given a whole lot to do with the character other than appear menacing and bark orders. There were a few flashes of character development for him, but nothing so substantial as to make him appear any more or less dangerous than any other villain you would find in a `Star Trek' movie. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't make any mention of his presence in the film; Leonard Nimoy reprises his role of Spock once again. Surprisingly, Nimoy's appearance in the film isn't relegated to being a bit of stunt casting for a glorified cameo; instead, the presence ofthe much older Spock is integral to the movie's central plotline and provides some very fun moments within the film.    Over 40 years since the original series first introduced us to this enduring franchise, and despite a few rough patches of waning popularity over the last several years, J.J. Abrams' \\"Star Trek\\" restores the series to its former magnificence. With a great story, a terrific cast, and visual effects that are nothing short of incredible, \\"Star Trek\\" has become my new favorite entry into this series, removing \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" from the coveted position.    \\"Star Trek\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.
B0013V33DG|3.0|First-off let me unabashedly say that I generally don't like Donizetti's music but I like Natalie Dessay so I bit the bullet and got this DVD.  The good news: Dessay and co-star Juan Diego Florez are brilliant singers and pull off their parts very well.  The rest of the cast does a good job as well and support the leading players very well,  the chorus work is clean and tight, and the orchestra sounds great and gives a very spirited rendering of the overture under the baton of conductor Bruno Campanella.  The bad: The production itself.  Ugly, distorted sets, drab and very clumsily executed costumes, singers that are not allowed to stand still for longer than a nano-second, and a generally over-the-top take on the opera itself.  I found myself bored after 30 minutes, turned it off, came back the next night, lasted another 30 minutes and then, just as I was ready to take another nap-break, something interesting happened - the story finally started.  There's something wrong with an opera that takes so long to get moving (unless it's Wagner - but he's a different story).  Anyway, I did enjoy the second act much more than the first and, in spite of its \\"bad\\" qualities, this DVD will not join my shelf of \\"dust-collectors\\".
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Mad Men is one of the best shows on television right now and could stand head-to-head with the best shows of any era. The attention to detail is stunning, the depth of character allows for repeated rewatchings, the topics dealt with still resonate today.<br /><br />The cast is a miracle. Jon Hamm is brilliant as Don Draper. You watch him in amazement when he acts and reacts in such a compelling way -- subtle changes in expression convey volumes. Season 2 was also a great year for January Jones, and it's shocking that she didn't receive an Emmy nomination as a reward for her convincing portrayal of a woman on the edge. Christina Hendricks and Elisabeth Moss also did a fabulous and memorable job. John Slattery is perfection as the smarmy, entitled jerk who you can't help but like. Vincent Kartheiser has also come a long way from his turn as Connor on Angel, playing to perfection the emotionally stunted character of Pete Campbell.<br /><br />The show doesn't have a lot -- or any -- explosions, except emotional ones. The interest is in the rich psychological lives of these people, most of whom are trying to hide their true identities in some way. Mad Men is for people who want a show that engages them and makes it worthwhile to pay close attention. It doesn't spoon feed answers, which makes it extra fun to analyze and interpret -- and your conclusions say a lot about you and your experiences.<br /><br />The extras here, and the same can be said of season 1, include an average of 2 commentaries per episode, and that's a boon for people who want to get behind the creative process of a show that rewards people who watch carefully. As always, some people are better at commentaries than others, but -- fortunately -- Matt Weiner and/or Elisabeth Moss are present on the majority of the tracks, and they always have good stuff to share.<br /><br />This show is a legend in the making and it's not too late for new-comers to catch up!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Suggest that people who enjoy the movie look at some of the deleted scenes on youtube - particularly the end scene between Capa and Pinbacker.  Word has it that if they kept that important scene in the movie, it would have been the first time in major motion picture history where the hero character who saves the world is atheist and clearly states it.
0307341569|3.0|I loved Sharp Objects and I was really looking forward to reading Dark Places. I never connected with Libby, the main character.  While I realize that Libby is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, I still think she made bizarre choices that were never believable.  (The people she meets along the way don't seem to be all that mentally healthy either.) To profit from one's trauma is one thing, but to revel in it is another.      To sum it up: I feel there's only so much angst that is believable.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|This discussion needs to begin with the idea that whatever critique comes of this film; it is not in direct correlation to those that suffer from autism.  The words written herein are only used to discuss the film \\"Rain Man\\", not to have a lengthy discussion on my thoughts with this serious condition.  With that said, I recently had the opportunity to sit down and watch \\"Rain Man\\" commercial-free, and unedited by TV - viewing it the way audiences may have seen it in theaters - and I wondered - is \\"Rain Man\\" that wonderful of a film, or we just all taken-aback by the intense performance by Dustin Hoffman?  This is a tough question as I was somewhat bored with the story that Morrow and Base put together, yet each scene that Hoffman was in I was glued to the screen watching his idiosyncrasies, his apt ability to make this character out of merely studied influences.  Hoffman deserved the Oscar for this film, but again, looking back - was it deserving of everything else that it won?<br /><br />\\"Rain Man\\" recycles this age old story that Hollywood is familiar with, a dying family member leaves a will to another, unknown, family member that eventually becomes the savior of the film.  The groundlings to this story are not anything new to direct-to-video markets, but with Hoffman and Cruise headlining, there is more of a mass appeal.  What pulls this film up is, as already stated, Hoffman - continuing to prove his worth - but yet slips downward yet again with Cruise.  He seems to be a bit of a loose cannon in this role.  For the first moment that we see him, he is this fast-talking, smooth sailing entrepreneur that seems to be going through this financial crisis.  Randomly he is able to leave, drive from California to Florida and finally making a pit stop in Ohio for his father's funeral.  Upon arriving he becomes bitter and more sinister as he learns that he is not inheriting his father's wealth, but instead has a brother that will have it all.  As we discover whom this is - our film changes from this family plight to this road movie - going all over our great nation to demonstrate brotherly love.  Yet - from the moment this voyage begins, we see less and less of the Cruise's initial character and we are welcomed into the third stage of Cruise, caring man who is just trying to survive.<br /><br />Where \\"Rain Man\\" gets itself into trouble is that Hoffman is so good, we are unable to fully develop Cruise's character.  We are glued to Hoffman on the screen, and thus Cruise can get away with anything (slipping in and out of character within scenes) because are eyes are focused on one man, and one man only.  Cruise does give a performance in this film, but it seems stale and disjointed.  His emotion never seems to come out, especially with the very dark ending - leaving us with no hope for the future?  The bleakest of endings, I was left wondering how much this would have worked if we were to focus on Cruise's character throughout, only giving us glimpses of Hoffman throughout the film.  I would have liked to see his inner turmoil, his struggle without the glossiness that was handed to us.  As a man with no money, he was easily able to maneuver anything that his brother wanted?  The suits for Vegas were not free.  Yet, we seem to let this slide off our backs when we talk about this film because we are all in awe of Hoffman, which we have every right to be.  Personally, Hoffman deserves all the kudos for his role, but watch Cruise carefully; I believe he gives one of the worst performances of his career.<br /><br /> Then there is Barry Levinson.  There is so much that I like about him as a director and there are moments in this film that he pulls your heartstrings hard - and with the greatest of ease.  He never gave us a false impression of autism - there are these moments where we believe Hoffman will say something that doesn't fit, there are plenty of music-leading moments, but instead he pulls the rug and gives us honesty and truth.  I appreciated that and adored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work.  Once we were out of the car, we were rushed to a conclusion.  The less-tender moments at the end didn't congeal well, leaving us with false hope and darkness.  This isn't a happy film, and I just don't think Levinson had a way to wrap it up.  The train scene was disappointing and disastrous to say the least.<br /><br />Overall, I think I am going to answer my own question.  \\"Rain Man\\" doesn't seem to last the test of time.  Hoffman's performance kept the over two hours worth the viewing, but I don't think I could watch this again.  \\"Rain Man\\" is a mediocre film fueled by one great performance.  There isn't any meat to the overall story, and at times it just seem to flop around on the floor waiting for something to put it back into the vastness of cinema.  \\"Rain Man\\" did sweep the Oscars that year, giving everyone that feeling of joy - but nearly 21 years later, it just doesn't remain a memberable film.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****ored Levinson's choice of cinematography, but the ending needed work.

B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I dont like when people write \\" the worst movie ever\\"   it is such a petty and stupid statement with  no depth attached to it.  if you dont like it , please  dont comment.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|It is so sad that so much money is being spent on this type of movie these days... I don't know if it is a Republican plot to pre-condition all of us, to \\"NUMB\\" us to the horrors of war, or just bad taste gone wild... this movie does have some good acting and some great special effects, but the overall texture to this madness is nothing rising above vile and disgusting. We are subjected to 2 1/2 hours, almost all of it exibiting the lowest behaviors known to man... rape, mutilation, murder, baby killing, and corrupt government leaders (in this hell, nixon is still president!). If the goal of the movie makers was to instill a deep depression... then it worked! A-holes!
1416914307|2.0|I was hoping that City of Glass would end the triolgy with a bang, but just like Stephenie Meyer's Breaking Dawn, the last book from Cassandra Clare failed to live up to its potential.     Everything about the book was predictable. Yes, from the beginning of the second book I knew that Jace and Clary were more than likely not brother and sister. Why else would a YA author be pushing an incestuous relationship if in the end they were going to be related? Personally, I would have preferred they stayed brother and sister, that would have been extremely original and pushing the envelope, but Clare wimped out on that potentially interesting idea.    Second, having Sebastian be Valentine's son, not Jace, was so easy to figure out. The foreshadowing of that \\"revelation\\" was not well done, as other reviewers here have stated. I have to admit that when Isabelle cuts off Sebastian's hand in a fight scene towards the end of the book, I LAUGHED. It was bloody awful. I expected Darth Vader to show up and say, \\"Luke, I'm your father!\\" Can Clare please stop stealing from George Lucas' universe? Sebastian's betrayal and eventual death at Jace's hand, again predictable.     Quite frankly, by the end of this book, I did not care who lived or died. I was not involved with Clare's characters as I was with J.K. Rowling's amazing characters in her Harry Potter series. I mourned each and every death in Harry Potter Book 7, but in City of Glass the only two people I even remotely liked were Alec and Magnus.    Alec and Magnus are the only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of one. Their relationship was original, fun and injected some much needed humor into the story. If Clare wanted to write a book just about them, I'd buy it, but if she writes another book about the dull, boring and insipid Jace and Clary - I'll pass. Reading about them and their \\"great romance\\" is like taking a Valium - snooze city.    Get this book at the library, don't waste your money.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a great mostly family-friendly movie. There is some drinking and a bit of violence, but nothing over emphasized. In fact, one of the themes of the movie is that stealing is wrong. My husband and I love the movie, me because of it's lack of swearing and sexual content, him because he loves to cook. Cute movie!
B00284BMBM|4.0|I loved the first album and this one comes close. It took a few listens but over all I like it. The best tracks are: You Don't Belong, What I Meant To Say, Open Your Eyes, Ghost Of Me. Sound quality is great. Definitely a hard-edge sounding album compared to the first one.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|On this effort, Diana Krall was lead astray by her arranger, Claus Oberman.  Mr. Oberman's excessive orchestration weighs down every song on this album.  The long droning violin lines, in an attempt to add a 1940ish romantic embellishment, get heavily in the way and render each bossa nova or moderately up tempo classic into a almost tearful dirge.  With a nod to the orchestration, Diana tries to deliver a more throaty sultry attack to each vocal but it just doesn't work.  Verve should issue a recall on this disc, destroy every copy, and reissue it with Ms. Krall backed only by her usual drums, guitar, and bass.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is no doubt a great movie, but why is it almost $30 when a new movie like Watchmen, with two discs and a plethora of special features, is only $20?  I would pre-order this, but it seems like robbery to me.
0307269981|4.0|The late Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy continues with this the solid followup to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Where Dragon Tatto was considered a \\"locked room\\" thriller one can view the sequel as more of a \\"wrong man\\" sceneario where Lisbeth Salander returning from travelling the world becomes embroiled in a murder mystery involving this time another variation on violence to women in the sex trade from Eastern Europe.<br />But like Dragon Tattoo things aren't that simple. Larsson again paints more a slow burn methodical thriller building things up. For the first part of the novel Salander is seen more still on vacation in the caribbean where she becomes involved with a couple where the husband may be plotting his wifes demise. Returning to Sweden she sets about seeing how things have progressed in the year she's been away becoming involved with two problems. On one front her disgraced guardian Nils Bjurman sets out to destroy her with help from secret organizations. On another spying on Mikael Blomkvist the journalist character from the first book she becomes ensnared in Millenium's concentrated efforts to simultaneously publish their magazine and a book based upon the sex trade with Salander becoming interested in a character who goes by the name Zala. Things heat up though when the two journalists investigating are found shot to death with murder weapon tied to Salander.<br />I'll admit that I definitely enjoyed this sequel more than the original mainly as it does focus a bit more on the character of Salander who's the lone antihero with a twisted past (truthfully I liked her character since she had her revenge upon Bjurman for the crime He commited against her in Dragon Tattoo). There were a lot of loose ends with her life at the end of Dragon Tattoo and thankfully Larsson does weave them into a very good methodical thriller that goes with that slow steady pace I enjoyed in the first book.<br />Even when Salander isn't the focus of the book I enjoyed the procedural element as you're left to guess at Salanders innocence when the two journalists are found dead and Blomkvist communicating through his hacked laptop with Salander only recieves cryptic messages leading him on chase to find Zala who does share an intimate history with Salander. Meanwhile theres the police side of the investigation with a character inspector Bubilanski who's leading a team of bickering police officers and two detectives from Milton Security one of which has his own motivations for wanting to get back at Salander.<br />If theres any problem with the book to me while I do like that Larsson continues exploring the idea of crimes done against women there were two characters in the novel that did border on cliche. I can respect even overlook the incredible ammount of coincedence that He uses when pushing his plots forward if the characters remain interesting but these two characters and their views bordered on silly. Thankfully they weren't used that much and didn't ruin what in my opinion is a solid follow up to what so far has been a series that earns its reputation.element as you're left to guess at Salanders innocence when the two journalists are found dead and Blomkvist communicating through his hacked laptop with Salander only recieves cryptic messages leading him on chase to find Zala who does share an intimate history with Salander.

It's all about being a vegetarian, with all the cancer scares and medical research to back up author's point of view.  God help you if you ever drink a glass of milk, make a will and get you're affairs in order.  The only reason PETA isn't endorsing the book is, too many mice died in the research.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Like many of you, this is where my life-long love of movies began. I first saw the original Star Wars in theaters when I was 7 years old. Since then, I owned the THX VHS widescreen editions, the VHS \\"special editions\\", the Laserdisc \\"original edition\\", and the DVD \\"Special Edition\\".    Therefore as a die hard movie fan and an Obsessive Star Wars Fan, I make the following plea to George Lucas nestled in his orbiting THX space station...     George, DON'T SCREW THIS ONE UP!    Whenever you finally release the original Star Wars Trilogy on Blu-Ray and whatever your legal muppets decide to charge for it, it MUST include at a minimum...    The original UNALTERED Star Wars Trilogy, color and artifact corrected and remastered in gorgeous 1080P HD. The sound track should be a Dolby True HD 5.2 remix of the original soundtracks.    We don't want to see Greedo shooting first!    We don't want to see gay, annoying CGI robots!    We don't want to see Jabba's Disco Dance Party!    If you want to include the \\"special editions\\" and other extras as BONUS CONTENT-that's fine, we'll accept that. But we will NOT accept any attempt to withhold an HD transfer of the original, unaltered Star Wars Trilogy on Blu-Ray!    Once again George, DON'T SCREW THIS ONE UP!
0142004235|5.0|I was really impressed by the characters and themes that Steinbeck drew and tackled in this novel.  I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese.  At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.    I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece.  For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends.  The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I'd have to say that having never read a book by Dennis Lehane before, I'm now a fan.  His writing style underlines the difference between being a good writer and a great writer.<br /><br />So many twists and turns in this book that you just can't guess what will happen next.  After finishing I had to go back to read the beginning just to make sure I actually got it.  I'm still stunned at the ending of the story.<br /><br />I will definitely read this author again and I'll re-read this book again.
0618918248|5.0|All those out there who disect books and waste so many words slicing things to ribbons...I just look for enjoyable things to read that educate me in meaningful ways.  This was just such a book. I don't veer away because of an objectionable title and I despise people who reject books (or anything, for that matter!) in wholesale fashion based on assumption alone.  One doesn't have to agree with an author to learn what they have to teach.  One doesn't have to have the same level of understanding of his specialties to gain insight.  I enjoyed this book for its enlightening information and humorous delivery.  Whatever your stance on religion, your opinion is worth nothing if you don't educate yourself about other ideas and opinions out there. The only true believer is an educated believer who knows why, what and how they believe.  If you don't soldify your own belief structure by exploring the other side of arguments, then don't bother sharing your thoughts.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|Of the last four albums DT has put out, Black Clouds & Silver Linings is the best. Since Train of Thought the band has been distracted from what they do best in favor of a harder, faster sound. Octavarium was the worst, since by the conclusion of \\"Never Enough\\" you realize you've just heard the same song formula (intro, verse, chorus, verse, shredding, chorus, outro) six times already, just with different lyrics and melodies (although the title track is a pleasure). Another problem I have with these latest releases is the obligatory ballad. Most of the album just seems like filler, something to whet the listener's appetite until it's time for the monster track to step up to the plate.<br /><br />While some of DT's metal epics are fantastic (like \\"As I Am\\" and \\"Panic Attack\\"), compared to the band's best work, they sound too loud, too fast, too incoherent. DT's strength has always been the stand-out proggy stuff. You know what I mean: the 15+ minute song with the gorgeous, ascending rhythm that you have to wait in your car a few minutes after you get to work so you can hear the end. \\"Repentance,\\" \\"Ministry of Lost Souls,\\" and \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" were undoubtedly the highlights to be gleaned from Systematic Chaos; the other four tracks are forgettable. As for Octavarium, the only track worth my time is the title track and MAYBE \\"Panic Attack.\\" Why give any of the other songs a listen when these are so clearly better?<br /><br />Well, of the six tracks on BC&SL, only two are forgettable: \\"A Rite of Passage\\" and \\"The Shattered Fortress.\\" I regard \\"A Rite of Passage\\" the same way I regard \\"Home\\" from Scenes from a Memory: a decent song, but not a concert crowd pleaser like \\"Pull Me Under\\" or \\"Fatal Tragedy.\\" As for \\"The Shattered Fortress,\\" it's a disappointing closer to Portnoy's Twelve-Step Suite. It revisits the themes from the previous four entries and builds on them a little and adds some new licks which sound great. But there's too much more of the same. I believe history will judge \\"This Dying Soul\\" and \\"Repentance\\" to be the best chapters in this book.<br /><br />\\"A Nightmare to Remember\\" is probably the hardest track on the album, but it's long and winding and broken in two halves by a gorgeous soft section. Furthermore, it follows that old DT tradition from Images and Words and Scenes from a Memory of using sound effects like a car crashing, ambulance sirens, and a beeping EKG machine to facilitate the story-telling. The song is dark and energetic and ton of fun. A great opener.<br /><br />\\"Wither\\" is not the obligatory ballad you think it would be. It's actually very sweet and emotional. It's got a good, rhythmic drive that doesn't wear itself thin like \\"Forsaken.\\" The lyrics are good and Petrucci has a good solo.<br /><br />These two songs are great, but they're chickenfeed compared to the two monsters: \\"The Best of Times\\" and \\"The Count of Tuscany.\\" The first is an upbeat eulogy to Portnoy's father, RIP. The lead-in theme is picked up by a piano, violin, and then an acoustic guitar. There's something anxious but at the same time celebratory and fulfilling about the melody. But what had me cheering in the middle of the song was how in sync the musicians were. It's the same harmony that destined the band's formative work to the Progressive Rock Hall of Fame. Petrucci closes the deal with an unforgettable fade-out solo.<br /><br />\\"The Count of Tuscany\\" is without a doubt the album's best track. The moment DT laid it down it was destined to become a concert staple. The story-telling is excellent, the melody eerie and exciting, and before you know it you're at the midway point grooving to a Vangelis-like soundscape. After four minutes of flying through outer space, LaBrie accompanied by an acoustic guitar bring us back to Earth. Then an uplifting finale that resolves the story nicely. My only grievance with this song is that there may have been a better way to break up the rhythm changes than Petrucci and Portnoyrepeatedly slapping their instruments as hard as they can.<br /><br />As for the album as a whole, the singing is clear and the lyrics poignant. LaBrie sounds his sincerest since his debut with the band in Images and Words, and he stands out in \\"Wither\\" and \\"The Best of Times.\\" Rudess is at times too bombastic with his shredding, especially in the bookend tracks. Myung's presence is still not what it was in the 1990s, but as is the case with bassists he's the most easily overlooked, and I'm sure without him the album would not have sounded the same. That said, BC&SL is prog rock excellency defined.they can.    As for the album as a whole, the singing is clear and the lyrics poignant.

B0018YIFEK|1.0|Are you guys (who think this book is just great) serious? The fact that a person would create another person solely for the purpose of saving a prior child's life is farfetched and selfish enough; the characters are all completely unsympathetic as well. The mother is hideous. The older daughter, Kate, is a ghost who is always portrayed as the ultimate victim. The father is a ghost. The brother is a crazy psycopath, and the parents don't even take the time to notice. By the time I finished the book, I wanted all of them to just shut up. The fact that it basically all \\"works out\\" in the end (meaning the mother and father got exactly what they asked for to begin with) makes me sick. This book and it's author are boring at best, and disgusting at worst.

B00008G9JN|5.0|[[ASIN:B00008G9JN Songs from the Wood]] Strange sliver by the fire,strange boots in the hallway. What can I say about songs from the wood that every Tull fan doesn't already know. Like it's one of the best Tull albums ever and very popular among fans. I understand why, It is a great album, a little softer than the previous ones like Aqualung and Minstral but that's the great thing about 70's Tull. Every album was different and had it's own sounds and concepts. Bottom line is that Songs from the wood is awesome and I think it;s a damn disgrace that Tull hasn't been considered for the rock&hall of fame. They contributed a hell of a lot more to rock than (The loving spoonfull) for example. Anyway if you like Tull than you should buy songs from the wood. Warning, it might take a while to grow on you if you're used to earlier Tull but it's worth it.

B001FB55H6|5.0|This is one of the best comic book adapations I have ever seen, Most of the douches who gave this movie a bad review loved Spiderman 3 and Orgins: Wolverine. This movie was so spot on the comic book it made me weep.
B0012QCZ54|1.0|This movie did not present ANYTHING new. It is as cliche'd as a film could get. The only thing different was that this time the poor chick was a white girl instead of a black or hispanic. I guess that was thrown in to score points but it didn't matter.    There are many reasons to skip this film. First reason is that there are a gazillion other movies out there JUST like it. Second reason is that many of those other films are much better than this in terms of acting and the dancing. Third reason is that this movie was just too cliche' to be interesting.    Supposedly Andie comes from \\"the streets\\" but she is no more street than John McCain! She's an unattractive tomboy who is trying too hard to be tough and the actress doesn't fit the role. She looks ten years older than the age of her character and so does the blond guy who is the supporting star. They both look at least early 30's trying to pass for teens. Their romance was unbelievable because they didn't have any chemistry at all. This movie would have been better if it centered around Andie's old crew that was \\"really\\" from the streets. They kept this film alive through all the boring and draggy spots.    The main characters are wooden and they cannot act. They are obviously professional dancers and not actors. The dance moves are cute (at times) but nothing new. If you're gonna do another dance movie, the moves should be different than anything that's been done before. This film copied all of their dance moves from films like \\"Stomp The Yard\\". NOTHING was new! The only difference was that Stomp The Yard was much better and the dancing was fierce.    I don't know why Step Up 2 was made but this is definitely a sequel that shouldn't have been. This is a ridiculous movie. I admit it's entertaining on a low level if you're not expecting much or if you haven't seen a dance flick before. If you haven't then you might think these moves were new but they weren't. There was nothing original about the dancing, actors orthe plot. I've never seen so many cliche's in ONE movie.    This movie was also unrealistic. The worst part was the street dance competition in the end. There would be no way that these clean cut wannabes would have even been allowed to go into an inner city club or participate in an innercity dance contest! They would have been beaten up if anything. That was too fake for words. The film didn't properly address the racial tensions and how serious street dancers are with their turf. Everyone is not welcomed and not just anyone can participate. If this film was gonna truly show how things are with the dance groups of the real streets, then they should have done some research. In real life they would have eaten those white kids up for lunch. I understand that the message of the film was to \\"bring people together in the streets through dance\\" and that's great but they should have tackled the rougher issues in the film to truly show the importance of that message. The characters should have been confronted with real hardships and struggles and they weren't.    Please skip this one if you are spending money. Watch it on Starz for free like I did. The economy is too bad to waste money on a movie like this that you can predict from the time it starts to the time it ends. If you want to watch a GREAT dance film that will blow you away  with some good acting and some folks from the real streets, then check out, \\"Stomp The Yard\\". Now that's how dancing is REALLY done in the streets!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The Firefly series creates an interesting post-Earth universe which combines hi-tech with a kind of post Civil War sentiment.  The mix makes for a very interesting place for these particular characters.  I really enjoyed the series. I wish it had survived longer.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|The ONLY time I ever heard of this movie was when I saw a TINY ad in the paper advertising it for the ONE theater showing it. I was intrigued by the reviews and read about it online.    I just watched it tonight on DVD and as a guy who loves guy movies I was most pleased! The box saying \\"Beowulf meets Predator\\" is right on.     The acting, scenery and special effects are pretty good. The main Amazon review says the plot is complex and pulls the viewer in many directions, I didn't feel that way after viewing it. The only thing not touched upon in depth was a prior event involving an ambush & the tribe's war with some type of raiders but that wasn't really relevant to the present day plot.    It's always nice to find a cool movie that we haven't seen a million trailers for! How fun is it to have a few friends over, pop this in & have them amazed that they never even heard of it.    I was also a fan of the movie Pathfinder which didn't fare well in the box office but at least had trailers on TV regularly.    I will definitely buy this on Blu-Ray in the near future.    Noah
B001HN69AE|1.0|If You Had/Have Any Expectations For This Adaptation That I Think By Now Is A Few Years Too Late. Think Again...This Movie Will Most Certainly Leave A Very Very Very Awful Taste In Your Mouth. I Felt Like I Would Feel If I Licked Some Tar Off The Street Pavement, Just Awful.    The Story Is Very Disappointing, I Think A Kid Could Write Much Better Than This...The Characters Are Like Garbled-Up Garbage (nothing against the actors). Oh, and For Being Dragonball, The Special Effects Are Disastrous! Made Me Think I Was Watching Something From 1992. The Matrix (1) has Better Special Effects and That Came Out 10 Years Ago!!!    20th Century Fox Got What They Asked For, With A Movie That Needed To Be \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" Epic, Story/Character/Special Effects Wise. They Ended Up Making A Fools \\"Dragonball\\".    I Hope Another Company Picks Up The Rights Years From Now, and Does This Franchise The Justice It Deserves.    This Dragon Has Most Certainly Lost It's Balls...
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I was already a teenager when The Jackson 5 came along, but I was swept up with their act and the brilliance of a 11 year old Michael (who looked even younger than that).  I saw them perform live in LA at the Forum.  After that I moved around a lot so I never got to see Michael perform solo.  I regret that, but I'm proud to say I'm still a fan.  This concert is awesome and well worth buying and watching.  If you can't see his  talent, you just aren't paying attention.  I recommend this DVD.  My only question... this was the Dangerous tour... and yet.. Michael never performed \\"Dangerous\\" during the concert... however it's still worth owning.
0618918248|5.0|This was the book that awoke me as an active atheist. Before I read it in 2007, I was basically a quiet and closeted atheist, and in fact, fell with believers on many issues such as a strong dislike for gay marriage(why?), ambivalence on the issue separation of Church and State and so on.    In the same way that Evolution by Natural selection raises our consciousness about how complex things can arise from simple processes, this book raised my consciousness about the real effects of unchallenged religion in our civilization. It caused me to look at my own beliefs, held since my days as a Christian 20 years ago and decide which ones really belong and which don't.     In reading this tome, I realized that religious people who repeatedly fail to assert any proof of their god and fail to find any basis for their alternative theories regarding the complexity of life or have instead merely taken their fight to the courts, more or less demanding to be heard.    This is akin to people demanding that the theory of a flat Earth be taught along side the theory that the planet is more less a sphere rotating about its axis and revolving about the sun.     Just as in the case of introducing a 'creationist' theory to be taught along with Evolution by Natural selection, we're left to wonder which theory to use. There are countless such theories. The Christians want their pet theory, which is the Jewish equivalent of Zeus flying around using magic and spells to help evolution along. There's even a variant in which god did it all 6,000 years ago. The Christians aren't even sure how much of the current real science they will accept. What would we teach along side evolution? That god helps it along (whenever science fails to explain a step, in which case expect many reprints of the text) or that god did it 6,000 years ago and Jesus might have been running from raptors while giving sermons.    He makes his argument from improbability, which I view as strong. Some people don't find thisargument compelling, but it is a very strong argument because it forces fundamentalists to be specific. Be specific, what is your proposition anyway?    The primary complaint from creationists is that the diversity of life is too fantastic to be explained by a natural, non-intelligent process--although any reasonably educated person can quickly find many examples of enormous complexity arising from simple sets of rules, but that's beside the point--They simply assert that it must have been designed (Paley).     However, the designer, presumably at least as complex as any one of us and likely much more compelx is simply assumed to exist. Voila! Dawkins demonstrates how silly this is by repeatedly asking 'who designed the designer?' Most fundamentalists will ignore the question or try to move it into a region where the question isn't valid, but  he won't allow it.  (John Allen Paulos offers even stronger defenses to this fundamentalists technique of moving god anywhere he'll fit to be able to carry out his magic without the need to answer any questions, in his book Irreligion).    Fundamentalists see other needs for god though, and Dawkins touches on these as well. Among these are 1) the origin of the Universe and 2) morality among many others.    Dawkins discusses these points, and I think does a good job of making a strong case that, for each of these, there is more than ample means of explaining them without introducing Zeus.    He explains the origins of morality as a natural consequence of and requirement for, survival of large groups such as humans and other mammals. Morality varies and has varied in humans. What was moral 150 years ago certainly isn't moral now. Morality shifts and evolves itself. It's natural, but it's evolved to such a degree at this point that it's clear the old testament is quite dated.     The bible is full of all sorts of immorality and genocide, infanticide, the killing of apostates, non-believers, animal sacrifice, and so on. Indeed, byour modern definition of what it means to be moral, much of the early biblical texts would need to be fully excised. We do not, he concludes, get our morality from the bible. Instead, we get our morality from culture in an ever shifting zeitgeist--which more or less is cultural advancement--and we then look at the bible through that lense.    Dawkins is a fantastic writer and an all-around genius who is matchless, in this format. Professor Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist who published the ground breaking text 'The Selfish Gene' in around 1976. He's also authored several other books on evolution.
0439023483|5.0|Author: Suzanne Collins<br />Pages: 374<br />Publisher: Scholastic Press (September 14, 2008)<br /><br />Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?<br />In the ruins of a place one known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to death before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Normally, I am not a sci-fi fan. But wow.<br /><br />This book was the epitome of amazing, causing a whirlwind of emotions to swell within you as you read. There is suspense and danger, love and loss, and quite a lot of sorrow and agony, and sometimes it's so much to bear that you're really just not sure what to feel. But those are the makings of a great writer, and Suzanne Collins is certainly that.<br /><br />It is very descriptive--without being over descriptive--and some of the battle scenes are gory. That's one of the great things, Collins is not afraid to show things how they go down. There is no mercy in this book, and that's what we need in today's YA.<br /><br />Fans of Twilight will love it, haters of Twilight will gobble it up with relish. There is no bad side to this book, and I am desperate to get my hands on a copy of the second book.<br /><br />Go out and BUY THIS BOOK. 5 stars.
B002HEOLFW|5.0|I always thought Chris Daughtry should've won Season 5(?) of American Idol, and he proves it on this album.    The first album was good, but it didn't blow me away, but the band seems to have matured quite a bit on \\"Leave This Town\\" and sound more mainstream than they did on the first album. The album also feels more like a rock album than the first, with more guitars and heavier sounds (though not as heavy as most other rock groups).    My favorite tracks are \\"On the Inside\\", \\"What Have We Become\\", \\"Every Time You Turn Around\\", \\"No Surprise\\", and \\"Ghost of Me\\". The two bonus tracks \\"On The Inside\\" and \\"What Have We Become\\" are absolutely amazing. If you liked the first album, you'll love this one.    If you like rock in general, you should give this album a listen for sure.

B000VSAEYI|4.0|My 2 girls, 7 and 5, loved this pool. We had it for a week and it held up great to the kids jumping and flopping all over. I'm sure it would have been used throughout the summer but sadly it was clawed by an animal during the night and it won't maintain the repair. I purchased some bigger repair patches and will try again to fix it. I'm hoping it will hold but not counting on it. I knew it was going to be a one summer use but I wanted to get more than a week out of it. Not the fault of the product but I guess the design drew the attention of some sharp clawed animal.<br />Update: the repair didn't hold so we bought one of the rectangular pools. So far that's held up for over a month and my girls will play in there for hours.

I can't imagine keeping up with this workout further along in my pregnancy. Just the warmup alone had my heartrate going. It is very fast paced -- Erin calls it \\"circuit training\\" -- basically not giving you a chance to rest as you go from one exercise to the next. If you're a pro at aerobics, this is the DVD for you.
B000OPOAJS|4.0|*** BLU RAY REVIEW ***<br /><br />For the first 20 minutes of John Frankenheimer's 1998 brilliant chase movie, you look at the BLU RAY box and wonder where the hell is the improvement? At the time they made it, they weren't of course thinking about future formats and their picture quality exposing limitations - they were just thinking about getting the mood right and setting up the plot. Filmed in a dark alley and then a dim French cafe at night, and staying there for quite a while - the opening clarity isn't great and I find that the BLU RAY format only accentuates this - the deficiencies of indoor lighting. But once you get to the daytime scenes that follow, then the fabulous city locations after that and especially to the close-up shots of the actor's faces, things improve dramatically.<br /><br />And like that other genius caper movie of the Nineties \\"The Usual Suspects\\", not only could you not pay for such a stunning and diverse cast now - \\"Ronin\\" has admirably stood the test of time. It bears repeated viewing which of course makes it ideal BLU RAY replacement-fodder.<br /><br />For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed the picture improvements - Nastasha McElhone's gorgeously huge eyes - De Niro's mole - Jean Reno's stubble - Sean Bean's sweaty brow - it's all there and amplified. And those fantastic car-chases that \\"Bourne\\" surely aped... There's even an unintentionally funny moment when Stellan Skarsgard is in his car with a gun and silencer about to trade the silver case to some dodgy type - you can see the lipstick accentuating his lips - its looks comical. And then that famous De Niro scene where he instructs Michael Lonsdale and Jean Reno to surgically remove a Teflon-laced bullet from his stomach without anaesthetic so he can remain conscious throughout and direct them properly - is just priceless (the title of this review is the dialogue De Niro speaks after the operation is over).<br /><br />But as other reviewers have noted, the big let down is the lack of extras - and especially the absence of the startling brutal alternative ending where Natasha McElhone's Belfast character 'Deirdre' is involved - it's missing - and many thought it a better ending than the one used in cinema's.<br /><br />And worse than that - there's no insights? I mean if ever a film deserved commentaries and a more than a few making-of features - then it's \\"Ronin\\".<br /><br />Still - a great film - now visually improved - and as wicked a movie as you remember it.<br /><br />Despite its bare-bones presentation - it's recommended.e absence of the startling brutal alternative ending where Natasha McElhone's Belfast character 'Deirdre' is involved - it's missing - and many thought it a better ending than the one used in cinema's.

141690977X|4.0|He's Just Not That Into You is mainly written by self-proclaimed \\"bad guy\\" Greg Behrendt who was a consultant on the show \\"Sex and the City\\". He bluntly explains why men act the way they do and how women should interpret their actions. We also get the female version through Liz Tuccillo's words (also a consultant for SATC). What I liked most about this book is that the authors never make the reader feel as if they have to change who they are in order to snag a guy. This book is about learning how to deal with the men in your relationships and realizing when the time has come to cut your losses and just move on.<br /><br />Overall, a great insight into the way a man's mind works and also a hilariously funny read. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions!<br /><br />Although this book is a self-help book (which did not really apply to me), I can say that I learned one thing from it and that was to realize how much my husband was really into me when we were dating and still is after 10 years.<br /><br />Some parts that I thought were great:<br />\\"My favorite innocent words and phrases that can be used for evil:<br />1. \\" I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you\\"<br />2. \\" Fear of Intimacy\\"<br />3. \\" Busy\\"<br />4. \\" Im not ready\\"<br />5. \\"Call me''<br />True meaning: He does not really like you!\\"<br /><br />\\" Women don't need to plot, scheme, and beg to get someone to ask us out.

0307588335|5.0|Engaging, well written and fascinating. A modern Greek tragedy, in every sense of the term, complete with kings with their tragic flaws, a Greek Chorus, and a horrible ending, extremely insightful and well told. I know a lot of the major players, having spent 15 years at the firm, and though I missed the last act, it all rings completely true to me.
B000067CPX|5.0|I'd give this album 4.5 stars, because it isn't perfect. Almost no albums are. This album tends to lean towards being less funky than the last. It's softer, but i like it better. or me californiacation was too much. I love tracks one through eight. especially dosed. But one song i hate is cabron. basically i just love john frusciante's guitar playing. every note he hits even if it's as simple as two in a solo is just perfect. you need this album.
0545123267|5.0|Years ago, Grace was attacked by a starving wolf pack, and only survived because one wolf, the one with brilliant yellow eyes, protected her. Ever since then she's watched for \\"her\\" wolf each winter, caught in a longing she can't quite explain. Then one fall a boy appears on her porch, injured, with those same yellow eyes. Grace knows he is her wolf.<br /><br />Grace feels more connected to Sam than anyone else in her life, and Sam would do anything for her. But right from the beginning, a shadow looms over their time together. As the weather gets colder, it's harder and harder for Sam to stay human. And he's sure that this time, when he turns into a wolf, it will be for good.<br /><br />SHIVER is a melancholy, romantic novel with equal parts tenderness and passion. Readers will find themselves swept up in Grace and Sam's unfolding relationship as they are finally able to talk and touch, and struggle to hold on to what little time they have together. The book is filled with gorgeous imagery that comes alive in your mind, and adds to the sense of fleeting beauty.<br /><br />Some may find the story a little slow-moving: many of the scenes are simply Grace and Sam being together, and of the few subplots that increase the suspense, all but one are dropped with little or no resolution. But the book is well worth picking up just for the character study of a boy growing up torn between human and animal worlds, and the main characters' chemistry and frantic attempts to hold off Sam's change will keep appreciative readers glued to the page.<br /><br />Recommended for paranormal fans who prefer thoughtfulness and simmering emotion to action and violence.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Lynn Crow
0307473465|4.0|The Reader is the story of a young man's association with an older woman. It is the story of how relationships can affect and eventually structure our lives. Michael Berg (15 y/o) meats Hanna (36 y/o) and has a short but life-changing affair with her. Years later, he is a witness to her trial for crimes commited during the Holocaust.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish, this book hits hard and will stay with you later. To oversimplify it, it comes down to one step affecting the next and the subsequent deterioration of moral structure.<br /><br />I like the way it ruminates on the mixed feelings of guilt, enlightenment, culpability and self-righteousness of Germany's second generation following the generation that perpetrated the Holocaust.

0316017922|4.0|This is another Gladwell's cool book. I've read the all and they all are very enjoyable and fun to read. The missing star is because I found as if Mr. Gladwell is repeating himself. The collection of clever ideas and unusual data has become Mr. Gladwell's trademark. But in his previous books everything was based upon some powerful insights. According to my taste the basic premise behind Outliers is not as powerful as the other two.<br />It's worth the money, fun to read, filled with clever data, but I didn't find that \\"Ooomph!\\" whack in the head I found in \\"Tipping point\\" or \\"Blink\\".
B00005JKC3|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Ang Lee(I like two other movies by him) but this gem has been denied for far too long. I think people expected this movie to be a brainless blockbuster and were upset when it didnt turn out the way they expected it to be. Hulk is pretty good with a few flaws(which I will mention later). Its definitely better than its given credit for.    The movie details Bruce Banner(Eric Bana)'s coming to be the Hulk. It deals with the Hulk's origin from Bruce's childhood to his teenage years. It also deals with his estranged father(Nick Nolte) coming back into his life. It deals with his relationship with Betty Ross(Jennifer Connelly)and her father Thaddeus(Sam Elliott)hatred for Bruce.     The acting is good all around. Eric Bana gives a heartfelt performance as Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connelly is a sweetheart as Betty Ross and Sam Elliott is perfect as Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross. Nick Nolte is also great as Bruce's eccentric father. Josh Lucas is the quintessential jerk as Talbot.    As much as I like this movie I cant give it five stars because...    Flaws: 1. The numerous attempts to get us to feel sympathy for Bruce being the Hulk. I applaud the effort but it just doesnt work for me. Bruce never hurts a loved one as the Hulk. We can only feel sympathy for him if he hurts everybody he loves as Hulk. But most of the people he hurts had it coming so to get us to sympathize with him is kind of difficult.    2. The split screens. Split screens are useful when there is action. This movie tends to overdue them alot. When there is action split screens are useful but when nothing is happening on screen you waste the effect o split screens.    3. Length. I have no problem with this movie being long but there are some scenes in the movie that are superfluous to the storyline and should have been cut.    Other than that this movie is pretty good. I'll admit that at first viewing I thought it was decent but second viewing I liked it a lot more.  Its definitelybetter than the instantly forgettable 2008 sequel. And before I leave I must settle this argument. While the 2008 sequel is not bad its not memorable. How can you forget Hulk battling the gamma mutated puppies in this movie? How can you forget the helicopter chase scene? How can you forget Hulk handing Talbot his rear end on a platter? How can you forget the insight about Science and the harmful experiments ran on humans and animals? Hulk 2008 the only thing you remember is a solid performance by Edward Norton and thats it. Instantly forgettable and was brought to you by the same director that gave you the easily forgotten Transporter 2. In conclusion Hulk is an underrated and unappreciated gem from a director that deserved more credit than he got for this movie. 2 thumbs up and thanks a million to everybody that defends this movie.
0385340990|5.0|I picked this up on a whim and can say that there are not enough words to describe how wonderful this book really is. This is definitnely one of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />Set in England and the Channel island of Guernsey immediately following World War II, we meet Juliet Ashton (our protagonist and writer) who suddenly receives a letter from Dawsey Adams (Guernsey dweller) requesting some information on author, Charles Lamb. Thus begins a correspondence that leads her to discover the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society and her next writing project/book. Through her letters with her new Guernsey acquaintances we get a feel for the German occupation of the Channel Islands during the five years of war.<br /><br />The book is written in epistolary format which brought both levity and personalization to the German occupation of Guernsey. Considering the correspondence format, I was surprised at the character development. I fell in love with Dawsey, Isola, Sidney, Elizabeth, Kit - they were the true heart to this story and I also liked that it brought some humanity to the German soldiers as well.<br /><br />I remarked to my husband that this book would make a marvelous film and after a quick Google search I was pleased to find out that the film rights have already been bought. I also sadly learned that author Mary Ann Shaffer passed away last February. Her illness caused her niece Annie Barrows to finish the book. I am in awe that this was Mary Anne's first book.<br /><br />This was a treat and a hands down MUST READ!
0307278255|5.0|I have read Jhumpa Lahiri's other books and novel, but this book I did not want to set down. I'm an 18 year old girl so you would guesss that reading isnt exactly in my list of things to do, but this book was so captivating and the characters were so surreal it was hard to not keep reading. You could relate to them so easily even if you arent bengalia or indian. It's a lot to do with just human nature and that is something anyone would be able to relate too. She got a bit more emotional with her stories and explored more of the characters feelings. Which really makes you feel closer to each and every character and keeps you guessing on whats to come. All in all this book was great I would recommend this to anyone who is open-minded :) really changes you views on people and life :D    Great Job Jhumpa!! Best work yet!
B0025X4PL0|4.0|I am a relatively new addition to the circle of Oceansize fans.  I picked up their stunningly impressive album \\"Everyone Into Position\\" a little over a year ago and I absolutely loved it.  It had moodiness, emotion, depth, and an engaging mix of progressive rock, space rock, delicacy, and power.  So when I learned of the North American release of their 2007 album \\"Frames\\" a few months ago, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy and discover the direction of their musical trajectory.<br /><br />I have to admit that I had a tough time with \\"Frames\\" upon my first listen.  The album is very different from EIP.  The eight songs that comprise \\"Frames\\" are denser, darker, moodier, and less accessible than the tracks on EIP.  There is much more experimentation on display here, and as a result (and especially if you are using EIP as your frame of reference) the songs might not grab you on the first couple of spins of the disc.  However, that is where the beauty of this album lies: it rewards your patience.  The more time I spent listening to it, the more the album revealed all of Oceansize's various influences to me through the shadings, arrangements, structures, and instrumentations of each track.  Thus the title of my review...<br /><br />The opening track 'Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt' is especially effective at setting the tone that this album is not merely a followup to EIP but instead stands alone as its own autonomous musical statement.  It builds on a simple and delicate odd-time guitar melody to an eventual crescendo of heavy power chord riffing, yet despite all of the dynamic variations during the next 8 minutes they never really stray from the primary melody.  The ability to create a song that long, based on one main musical idea, and that doesn't get old or stale or feel repetitive, is actually pretty impressive.  It is probably my favorite track on the album.<br /><br />The remaining songs each reveal glimpses into the influences that have inspired the band over the years.  There are familiar strains from Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and Oasis here, but also some unexpected echoes from Meshuggah (on 'Sleeping Dogs And Dead Lions') and perhaps a touch of Mastodon or Kyuss on the monolithic intrumental 'An Old Friend Of The Christys.'<br /><br />Oceansize has created an album that requires the listener to invest some time absorbing it, and I think this is why it is so successful.  It's not the kind of album where you will immediately know whether or not you like it, so you will have to spin it again.  And again.  And then you will suddenly realize the level of their achievement, even if it is slightly self-indulgent and just a bit arrogant in a spot or two.  My only complaint is that a few parts wander a bit too long and almost outstay their welcome, but this is simply a minor nitpick on my part.<br /><br />The bonus DVD that comes with the CD features the band in an old warehouse playing the tracks from the album live and in order.  The production is minimal here - basic lighting, several mounted and handheld cameras, some amplifiers and microphones, and the band arranged in a circle playing their songs.  I very much enjoyed watching them perform their album in a remote location without a cheering audience in front of them, so that I could focus on the energy and effort they put into each song.  The live DVD creates a very unique and engaging way to listen to \\"Frames\\" and I must commend the band on their decision to record it and provide it with the CD.<br /><br />If you enjoy progressive/space/art rock music that is challenging and looking to carve out its own unique space, I would definitely recommend this engaging release from Oceansize.  Just be prepared to spend some time with it...familiar strains from Radiohead, Pink Floyd, and Oasis here, but also some unexpected echoes from Meshuggah (on 'Sleeping Dogs And Dead Lions') and perhaps a touch of Mastodon or Kyuss on the monolithic intrumental 'An Old Friend Of The Christys.'

It's not the kind of album where you will immediately know whether or not you like it, so you will have to spin it again.  And again.  And then you will suddenly realize the level of their achievement, even if it is slightly self-indulgent and just a bit arrogant in a spot or two.  My only complaint is that a few parts wander a bit too long and almost outstay their welcome, but this is simply a minor nitpick on my part.    The bonus DVD that comes with the CD features the band in an old warehouse playing the tracks from the album live and in order.  The production is minimal here - basic lighting, several mounted and handheld cameras, some amplifiers and microphones, and the band arranged in a circle playing their songs.  I very much enjoyed watching them perform their album in a remote location without a cheering audience in front of them, so that I could focus on the energy and effort they put into each song.  The live DVD creates a very unique and engaging way to listen to \\"Frames\\" and I must commend the band on their decision to record it and provide it with the CD.    If you enjoy progressive/space/art rock music that is challenging and looking to carve out its own unique space, I would definitely recommend this engaging release from Oceansize.  Just be prepared to spend some time with it...

0743496736|5.0|In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game. In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five. In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge.<br /><br />Nineteen Minutes is set in Sterling, New Hampshire - a town where nothing ever happens - that is until the day that Peter Houghton walks into his high school and in 19 minutes kills and injures several of his classmates and teachers. The story is told through several perspectives and ranges anywhere from when before Peter is born until about one year after the deadly shooting. We hear from Peter's parents, his old best friend Josie Cormier, who eventually became part of the popular crowd and abandoned her friendship with Peter, Josie's mom, Alex - also the judge sitting on the case, Patrick the detective who was able to apprehend Peter after the shooting and, of course, Peter himself.<br /><br />I was so caught up in this book while reading it - there were just so many emotions that I went through (anger, despair, heartbreak, sadness, etc.) The story is written in a way that helps you relate and even sympathize with all of the main characters. I thought it gave good insight into bullying, and the torture that some kids are put through while in school. The peer pressure, the complicated tumultuous life of teens - was perfectly captured.<br /><br />This book will stick with me for a while, I think.
0762434279|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad has become one of the single most successful-best selling financial help books ever---and for a good reason; the advice works. Right now in this recession there are so many opportunities - that it's time to take a second look and re-double your efforts - so read it again!  What does it say?  It tells people not what they want to hear, but they need to hear.  Also recommend is Rich Dad's Guide to Investing which offers better investing strategies than just blindly buying mutual funds or listening to your broker without rhyme or reason - we all know where that got us - when the market is hot, brokers take credit, when it'd down, they claim it's not their fault.     Regardless of whether you are interested in learning more about real estate investing, buying or selling a business, creating a second income or a new career or just general financial issues, you will find the advice you are looking for in RDPD and in the Rich Dad's Advisors Series.  What is interesting to me is what Kiyosaki has in common with Horatio Alger, as Alger's books - novels of rags to riches - were very much like the effect one has reading a RDPD book.  Not only uplifting, (all Alger's books are uplifting and very powerful in that way), but Alger always explained in his novels HOW a person was successful, (even down to the math), and these were more than principles, but examples that someone could duplicate in a different business and move forward, succeed and prosper.  Kiyosaki does the same in his books, and I would recommend you read all the books by all of these authors.    I just found a very nice set of great reprinted Alger books, (I'll leave you with a few).  All in all, Kiyosaki, Alder, they are all great, inspiring, and what we need to read in this recession, negative, and cynical world.

0307474275|3.0|While this book was not bad by any means it was a decent work of FICTION. It has always amazed me why this book is so popular. When it comes down to it this book is just another work of fiction. I am a born again Christian but have no qualms with this book yeah it's blasphemous of course, but its a book for God's sake. I am too mature to be upset about a book. Christians' get so worked up over the smallest things it's ludicrous. Christians should be more worried about reaching people for Christ instead of worrying about whats on the New York Slimes....I mean Times, bestseller list.<br /><br />My point is that this book is too mediocre to be so hyped. Its another book by another author and that's it, end of story. People act like this story has never been told before or that it has some kind of special powers. It's not special, its been done before in one way, shape or form. There are plenty of better books out there.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have noticed a bad trend lately, studios have been packaging Blu-ray+dvd+digital copy together and selling ti for a higher price insted of releasing Just the blu ray on its own. This seems to be just an excuse to overcharge for a movie. Hope it does Not continue.
0385751893|5.0|The story is told through the point-of-view of Bruno, a 9 year-old boy who is sadly naive to what the situation in his country is. When Bruno's family moves from Berlin, he leaves behind his three best friends and his beautiful 5-story home, making him a very unhappy young man. Bruno detests his new home at Out-With (Auschwitz). At Out-With there are no other children to play with other than his older (12) sister \\"who is a lost case\\" and the house only has 3-stories and barely any windows, not to mention they are somewhere in the country and not in a big city like he is used to. His family has to move after The Fury (The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler) comes to dinner at their Berlin house with a beautiful blonde lady (Eva Braun) to give his father a promotion. At Bruno's new house he can't see all the way across Berlin from his window (like he did in his old home) but he can see into a \\"farm\\" surrounded by a tall barbed wire fence with lots of boys milling about. He becomes jealous of these boys because they have lots of friends to play with, and he doesn't, and they get to wear striped pajamas all day, every day, while he has to wear all this fancy clothes all the time. All these are examples of how naive Bruno is, which is beautiful and so sad at the same time.<br /><br />As any 9 year old would, Bruno loves to explore. So, to keep himself occupied he begins exploring through their backyard. Through these daily adventures he eventually comes to a fence where he meets a young Jewish boy named Schmuel. Although Schmuel is on the other side of the fence, this does not deter the grand friendship that ensues.<br /><br />I found it a bit shocking how the author mixed innocence with violence in a very peculiar way. The writing style is simple, yet profound. A quick read; because you will not want to put it down, and a heart wrenching ending that will keep you thinking long after you've finished the book.<br /><br />On a side note: I also saw this movie about two weeks ago and it does not disappoint. It stayed true to the book on almost everything. It was a little different at the end but it still got its point across. It's a touching story and one that you shouldn't miss out on.stayed true to the book on almost everything. It was a little different at the end but it still got its point across.

However, if you want to get ideas to better your bank account, see what millionaires have done and how they 'think', and at the same time learn to think the same way and keep on the path toward a positive life, this is one of the best books you could read- still by far!  I've seen, listen, and laughed with Harv, and it was because of his powerful story that I first noticed him.  He is a master communicator of HOW to become a millionaire - but more than that he inspires you with actual true stories, (not just 'feel good' emotions).  That is why reading his books, or listening to him has such a great result in our lives.    What is interesting to me is what T. Harv has in common with Horatio Alger, as his books - the novels of rags to riches through a millionaire mindset- the Alger books were very much like the effect one has listening to Harv, or reading his book.  Not only uplifting, (all Alger's books are uplifting and very powerful in that way), but Alger always explained in his novels HOW a person was successful - right down to the math, and these were more than principles they were great mindset techniques, as well as examples that someone could duplicate in a different business and move forward, succeed and prosper by following the example of a millionaire character as promoted by Harv and Alger.  Harv does the same in all his books, and I would recommend you read all the books by any of these authors.    I just found a very nice set of great reprinted Alger books, (I'll leave you with a few but there are many).

B00288KNJU|5.0|Coraline has been reviewed over and over so I'm not going to add too much more about the movie itself. I agree with the positive reviews - it's creative and fanciful with wonderful stop-motion animation.    But if you're buying this DVD for the novelty of 3-D, I suggest you don't do it!  Although I should have known better, I was hoping that the producers had found a way to do 3-D with polarized channels for the Blu-Ray DVD. Unfortunately, they have not.    The 3-D is accomplished in 1950's style with blue and red channels viewed through blue and red lenses. This not only totally washes out the brilliant color from the 2-D version but actually makes you vaguely nauseous.  The 3-D effect is quite good and I'm sure that it was stunning in theaters but it is completely unwatchable on the DVD for more than a few minutes.    Buy the DVD for the movie if you wish, but don't buy it simply for the 3-D.  You'll be disappointed.
1419347004|5.0|I enjoying listening to books on cd. Emily Gray does a great job on bringing all her characters to life. She has the right voice for Becky.

0440244870|5.0|I was in the mood for something light and funny - just some mind candy. I was reading all these deep, thought-provoking books all last month that I thought I was in need of a break - and I couldn't have chosen anything better than Confessions of a Shopoholic.     Rebecca Bloomwood is 25, a writer for a magazine called Successful Savings, lives in a fab flat in a ritzy neighborhood, has all the latest clothes and fantastic, loveable rich friends - what more can a girl ask for right? Well, this would all be merry if it weren't for the fact that she is in debt trying to live a life that she just can't afford. Her troubles begin when she starts getting harassed by her loan creditors for repayment. Everyday more and more letters arrive requesting repayment and she is just too much of a shopoholic to stop all her frivolous spending.    Mostly the book deals with Rebecca trying to control her spending habits, but really only getting deeper and deeper in the hole. She is bored to death with her job and feels that no one in her industry respects her. She's a bit naive at times and the way she thought through her difficulties was rather irrational and unrealistic, I thought. But her scenarios and situations where just so fun to read about that none of that bothered me. I was literally sitting there laughing out loud at times. When she thinks she's going to win the lottery or she has to come up with the excuse of her \\"fake\\" aunt's death - were totally hilarious. And the letters from her creditors with all the excuses of why she can't make payments (i.e.: a broken leg, her dog died, glandular fever) - were roll on the floor funny.     So, if you're in the mood for something fun and light - this is a great choice. Total fluff but just what I needed at this point.
1416550542|5.0|Oh I cannot stress how beautifully this book is written.  After I read \\"The House at Riverton\\" which I also loved I knew I had to read anything written by this author.  Much to my dismay, these are her only two books.  What a shame......she is a fabulous author......I can't wait for her next novel.  Read both books, I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXCS|5.0|OK, you might gag if you're in the mood for something like Transformers (which I also love) but anyone with an appreciation for classic cinematography & acting will recognize why it's an \\"Amazon.com essential video\\".  The casting, directing, choreography, editing, even the costumes and sets, are superb.  The scenery is breath-taking & the chemistry between the cast members is as captivating as the music.  The music - what can I say - It's Rodgers & Hammerstein.  Sure, not a film you would select for futuristic special effects but way ahead of its time when you consider how long ago it was made.  It was a big hit as a gift for my parents' 52nd anniversary.  I caught part of it one weekend on TV & was reminded of how much they liked it when the movie when first came out & how we always had the soundtrack on an a vinyl LP in the house growing up.  I invited them over for dinner & planted them on my double reclining love seat with the DVD as a surprise.  They enjoyed seeing the movie again & were totally sucked into the whole thing, even tho' the movie is almost 3 hrs long.  I had read the reviews beforehand but noticed no problem w/ the DVD quality, even on my 46\\" flatscreen TV. The Bonus features are not as polished as contemporary ones, such as LOTR or Pirates that are filmed with that intent as the movie is being made, but still interesting enough to & add depth to the story & appreciation for the beautiful Austrian setting.  I have not seen or owned any of the other Sound of Music DVD sets, so I don't know how the bonus features compare.  All in all, a wonderfully classic film.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|The movie starts with Harry about to get a date.  Then, out of no where Dumbledore shows up.  (apparition anyone)  He tells Harry that he needs him.  He needs him to visit some one, an old teacher.  Dumbledore wants him to teach but the teacher always says no.  After Harry talking to him by himself (Dumbledore goes to the bathroom) the teacher still says no.  Then though he decides to do it.  So, now Hogwarts has a new teacher.  The teacher knew Voldemort when he attended Hogwarts.  Harry finds this out when Dumbledore takes a vile with a memory of his and dumps it in some water.  Harry puts his face in and sees the memory.  Dumbledore though, says it is a false memory.  He asks Harry to find out more about the teacher.<br /><br />The second part of the story involves a school book that Harry got.  It says Half Blood Prince.  The book has things written inside that help Harry with his spells.  So much so that even Hermione can't keep up.  So, Harry tries to figure out who the Half Blood Prince was.  Turns out that it may be a teacher that is at Hogwarts.  One which Harry may not get along with.  So, this person in with whom Harry can't talk to may be helping him out.<br /><br />Another part of the story, which ads humor, is the romance.  Ron has a girl who likes him very much.  Hermione may have a problem with this girl.  Ron keeps things going with her, always telling Harry about things they do together.  Poor Hermione is there as well.  She gets a little stressed and emotional when she hears him talking.  Something happens to Ron.  He is asleep in the hospital.  Harry and Hermione are standing by his side as well as some others and the girlfriend shows up.  After Hermione and her share some words they hear Ron saying something.  I will not say what it is.  But the girlfriend leaves.  Angry and hurt.  While Hermione remains, with a little added happiness.  Also, Harry starts to see Genie as something he could like.  She already seems to feel this way about harry.  So, what will happen with the two couples of friends?<br /><br />Then, there is something strange.  Something that is given to a student.  By someone Harry and his friends know.  Malfoy!  The item is a necklace.  When the girl it is given to touches it, she almost dies.  They are able to save her, but she can not remember who gave her the necklace.  Harry figures it out.  Dumbledore tells Harry that the item given to the girl is something very dangerous.  Turns out that the item has something to do with the memory that the teacher has.  The one Harry viewed in which Dumbledore told him was a false memory.  Harry has to convince the new teacher to let him see the real memory.  He does so and finds out that the necklace was a horcrux.  An item that lets someone break their should into parts.  Each part is out into an item and hidden.  Turns out Voldemort has do this.  Seven times!  Harry and Dumbledore decide that they have to find them.  For if they do it will help with the defeat of Voldemort.  Harry and Dumbledore find a place that has one of the pieces of soul.  They go to get it.  Before they do, Dumbledore tells Harry that he must listen to everything he says.  If he says run, run.  If he says leave him their, leave him their.  If Dumbledore screams in pain to stop, then Harry must force him to continue.  Well, something big happens.  I don't want to give it away though, so you will have to watch and see.<br /><br />In then end Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he cannot go back to school.  He has to find the Horcrux that Dumbledore and he started looking for.  Hermione tells him that sometimes, though brave, can be thick.  She tells him that they will all three go and look.  Thus the movie ends.  The movie flew by.  It was more serious than any of the Potter movies.  In my opinion that is.  You really feel like you have been there with them through it all.  They do a great job of making the characters feel like they grow with you.  It was all great and I can'twait to buy the DVD.

B0026PA05M|4.0|Just saw them in concert along with Staind, Shinedown, and Chevelle in Corbin, KY.  They did the drum solo that another reviewer mentioned, and it was incredible.    As for the CD, it's quite solid... no bad songs and definitely some that stand out.  They know how to put on a show (even though opening for these guys they only got to play about 5 songs) and I believe they have a solid future.  Definitely worth picking up!
B0007WPJBQ|4.0|There are many copies of this movie currently available. Hopefully they'll come out with a restored print one day done right both video and sound but until then there are only about two copies that are better than all the others and some are really bad!

0061689246|4.0|When Tristran Thorn is sent on a quest to find a falling star by his ladylove Victoria Forrester, little did he know of the magical adventure that would ensue.<br /><br />After falling in love with the film, and being acquainted with other Gaiman works over the past year, I had high expectations for this novel. But sadly, I must confess, I actually liked the film better - which was quite a surprise to me. Don't take me wrong, I enjoyed this book immensely, but the film just left out some of the irrelevant characters (i.e. stepmother and sister storyline) and brought a more comedic side to some of the more obscure characters in the book (i.e. Captain Shakespeare, the dead brothers, etc.).<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman's writing style had a marvelous balance between melodic poetics and simplistic ease in his sentence structure and wordsmithery.<br /><br />Stardust swept me away on a magical journey full of dark humor, love and adventure. It was a surprisingly modern and moving fairy tale about finding the missing part of ourselves hidden \\"behind the wall\\". Witches, pirates, and a love story... what more can you ask for in a fairytale. It just goes to show that fairytales are definitely not just for children.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|At this price, it is a wonder, a bargain if there ever was one.  Scenery, acting, music, all suit me nicely.  I have the book so I could see the novel scene by scene.  Of course, the movie is not a line by line creation of the book.  This long movie is close enough.  Dickens themes are done well.  Dickens is such a master of telling a story and creating characters.  Every character is done well.  The actress playing Amy Dorrit is just right.  Camera work is brillant.    I had no trouble understanding anyone's spoken words.    The special feature about making the film is really good, in my opinion.    It's the bees knees.

1416585710|4.0|... that Stephen King may be the greatest writer of our time.  Certainly he's the most popular, and that has sometimes gotten in the way of a hard-light evaluation of his skill (at any rate, it did in the 1980s when even the blind and people without feelings in their fingertips were claiming that, although physically unable to read, they found King to be their favorite author).  But he's popular for a reason, and, simply put, the reason is that he's arguably the best story-teller working today.  He has always transcended the horror genre that claimed him.  His mix of suspense, horror and anthropology make him less an Edgar Allan Poe (a comparison I always felt was a lazy one) than a hybrid of John Cheever and Richard Matheson.  And that is evident in \\"Lisey's Story\\", a remarkable achievement in a career filled with remarkable achievements.  The novel follows the widow, Lisey Landon, as she goes through the papers and remnants of her dead writer husband.  Universities have shown interest in these unfinished stories, including one professor who has hired a terrible man to do terrible things to Lisey if she doesn't fork over the goods.  While all this unfolds, we learn that Lisey's husband had a place he could physically place himself into that wasn't of this earth ... a place Lisey will have to rely on if she is to live through the professor and his terrible gun-for-hire.  This place, Boo'ya Moon is both lovely and horrifying (mostly horrifying) and it is this place and the reasons for any vistits to it that make Lisey's Story such a gripping read. -- What we learn throughout this tale is that Lisey and her husband didn't just love each other -- they relied on each other in a way both touching and disturbing.  We learn how Lisey's husband learned of Boo'ya Moon in his childhood (and these sections, hands down, rank among the best things King has ever written.  Once again we get a rural upbringing that is too soaked in religion and alcohol to be any good ... but the demons and possessions that plagued Scott Landon's childhood are all too real, and some of the images King cooks up will stay with you, especially when you have to visit a dark basement on some windy night).  King serves up the chills in fine style, but there is so much more at work (as there always is in King).  We get a detailed and realistic slice of rural Maine life, complete with habits and language and motives.  We get King's anthropological/archeological study of a people he has known all his life and a place he has never left.  John Cheever stayed in the suburb of Shady Hill and gave us the world ... so, too, does King.  They may seem \\"bumpkin-ish\\" to some, but their concerns are universal, even when battling the demonic (or maybe because of it).  King isn't a horror writer.  King is a story-teller of the highest order.  If you simply want a jolt, ther are plenty of books that cater to only that need.  But King's world is worth visiting for so many other things -- not the least of which is his insight into the craft of writing, which he sprinkles throughout Lisey's Story.  A heart-felt and compelling story from the best story-teller working today.
0240810961|5.0|\\"Drawn to Life\\" is a compendium of lectures given by Walt Stanchfield to aspiring animators at Disney. It is a really good book that contains a plethora of advice on topics that are of concern to all artists who draw. For example, his exposition of endowing your drawings with life, while ostentatiously for animators, will help anyone breathe life into their figurative drawing. It is important to note that much of the insights in this book are conveyed through drawing of the figure. However, as the figure is central to art, I don't see this as much of a drawback. As you go through this book you will find passages here and there that will resonate with you. I recommend bookmarking these passages as you will want to go back to them especially right before a day of drawing. What I mean is, this book is very inspirational to all types of artists who draw and I really recommend getting a copy. You will not regret it!

B000025802|4.0|Kubelik's set shines especially in the early symphonies, where inspiration is matched by first-class execution by the Berliners, who outdid the Londoners for Kertesz (e.g. in Symphony No.5).  Kubelik elicits some highly pointed rhythms and sprightly phrasings, which help a great deal in giving shape to these sometimes meandering early symphonies.<br /><br />There are technical imperfections.  The early 1970s recordings at Berlin's Jesus-Christus-Kirche (No.8 in 1966, the rest 1971-73) generally sound very dry, have some noticeable tape splices, tend to be compressed at fort&eacute;s, not to mention a bit shrilling at times too.  The tonal lushness of the Berliners, however, compensates for the typical dryness served by the DG engineers in Berlin during the 70s, creating a signature Berliner-DG sound (whether for Karajan or Kubelik).<br /><br />And despite the Berliners' polish and virtuosity, the hot-blooded Kubelik is able to get them into frenzied moments of abandon.  The 1st mvt climax before the coda of No.7 is a case in point, where the 1st violins, separated from the 2nd violins across the stage in Kubelik's favorite divided violins seating, threaten to get out of sync with the rest of the orchestra.  (The divided violins seating, btw, is not used in No.8---a pity.)  Such technical imperfections notwithstanding, this Dvorak 7, along with the Colin Davis and the Harnoncourt (both, incidentally, with the Concertgebouworkest), holds a special place in my heart and keeps me coming back to it since I first heard it on radio 20+ yrs ago.<br /><br />Taken individually, very characterful performances with heart.  As an integral set, the best Dvorak symphonies.  I should also mention that Kubelik's Bavarian recordings of Dvorak's Scherzo capriccioso, Carnival and The Wood Dove are exemplary.  Except for the Scherzo capriccioso, however, you could get them with all the rest (overtures, symphonic poems and slavonic dances) on a TRIO set.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I think Malin Akerman looks very stylish and sexy in her long leather coat in the movie.  She's also a tough fighter who kicks butt.  I really enjoy attractive women in movies/TV shows wearing long leather coats who kick butt.  She wears her leather coat in chapters 16-17, 22-24.  This movie is just plain smooth.
B0007KTBIU|1.0|This is a children's movie that no child should see.  It is full of political correct inane, unthinking nonsense and the characters are depicted in a crass and coarse manner.  No child should be subject to this foolish portrayal of the evil white man and the noble indian.  I suggest that parents read accounts of King Phillip's War which raged across New England during the colonial period. Certainly there is enough criticism to go around to both groups and children should be taught a few complex truths.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|A lot was good with the movie. It moved fast enough so that you didn't ask to many questions but when I got to really think about it the movie was just okay. If you got caught up in the hype about how this was the best star trek movie ever then you really didn't care about what was on the screen. I'll give you just one thing to think about. Kirk gets stranded on a planet, he gets chased by a monster, just happens to end up in a cave where older Spock is, they then go to the Federation base on the planet that just happens to have Mister Scott on it who just happens to be working on a transporter program that would allow one to beam aboard a ship in warp. Thats a lot to swallow. As I said great summer movie. Shove the popcorn down your throat, sit back, take the ride and don't think. That all being said I will probably buy the movie to add it to my collection. Of course, I'll wait until it's been put in the discount bin at Wal Mart
0374264260|5.0|You cannot miss with this debut novel packed with heartbreaking pathos.  You will root for the book's central character, Pat Peoples, to move forward in his life and become the kind person he strives to be.  The author, Matthew Quick, has created a page-turner of a story peppered with characters both lively, interesting, and well-developed, all whom you will cross your fingers for, as you silently cheer for their success.

0143142364|5.0|Ken Follet's book \\"World Without End\\" takes us back to the town of Kingsbridge and the people who reside there.  Ken introduces to new characters; descendants of Jack the Builder and Lady Aliana.  There are so many characters and each of them unique. This was a book that I could not put down!  I was terrific. I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book. I loved it.
1416955070|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this story!  It was recommended to me by a friend who loaned me the first book - City of Bones.  I devoured it in one sitting and went out the very next day to get the other two books.  The story line is intriguing and kept me coming back for more!  The characters are well developed and I found myself needing to know what happened next.  I strongly recommend this trilogy to anyone who may have enjoyed Twilight, The House of Night and any other books within that genre.  I plan on reading City of Bones/Ashes/Glass over and over I enjoyed them that much!
B0029NY9YO|1.0|It is obvious that very bright and interesting people really love both \\"The Watchmen\\" graphic novel and the filmed version based upon it. I wish I understood why. I found the film (which I saw in an Imax theatre with all the bells and whistles) incredibly slow with a collection of truly repulsive characters wandering around a tedious plot.

1416550542|4.0|I just finished reading this book and could hardly put it down.  I loved the characters in this book and how the author gave each of them a distinct voice.  There was an underlying sadness to the book and with one of the main characters that I find haunting.  I sincerely wish I hadn't read it so fast and that Kate Morton had another book for me to read!  I already read The House at Riverton (but enjoyed this book more).
0307266303|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars even though I am highly critical of it.  First, it is a great read, and what I liked most about it is it questions many assumptions we have about running in general.  Well-written, and easy and fun to read.  I enjoyed when it touched on anthropology and evolution.    But, it was just too over the top with the hyperbole for me.  It is a stretch to blame the running shoe industry for increases in running injuries.  The running population has expanded and aged dramatically since the 70's.  Just look at road race results from the 70s/80s until now and you'll see that 1) there are more people in the races, and 2) there are a lot more older people in them.  Advances in running shoes are a reason a lot of these people are able to take up this sport.  They would be hopelessly injured if they wore sandals or went barefoot.  Like it or not, without Nike there would be far fewer people running today.    I also think the author glorifies the \\"ultra\\" running community.  He makes them seem like they are all pure, back-to-nature, minimalist type runners.  Ever ultra person I know is a complete tech-junkie - they don't head out the door without their Garmin and their heart rate monitor, they plot things out in spreadsheets, and they like to talk about themselves and their activity more than other runners.  While I am sure many of them do it for the love of it, ultra runners seem to be always trying to get others to be impressed with what they do, which is something most elite runners just scoff at. Ultra runners tend to be very active in local running communities which is great - but to portray them as being anti-tech is just flat out inaccurate.    The author says that 50+ ultra runners are as good as 19 year olds. I found that to be ridiculous.  That is only because there are so few 19 year olds doing marathons and ultras - the ones with any running talent have so many opportunities at the shorter distances that few of them do these events.    Scott Jurekaside, most ultra runners don't even look like athletes, let alone runners.  He stands out because he is one of the few real athletes to take up the event.       To claim that the tribe in Mexico are the world's best runners is wildly interesting, but to do so without any mentions of Kenya and Ethiopia seems to be a convenient omission.  Let's get real - there are at least 100 men and probably 25 women in East Africa that could win the Western States 100 if they chose to enter it.  To ruin the ending of the book, one of the runners just edges out Jurek in a 50 mile race at the end. What do you think would have happened had Haile G showed up?        A real provocative, excellent book though.  Got me going - so I'd recommend it to all!
0743298039|3.0|The Thirteenth Tale kept my attention throughout and I was actually surprised by the ending.   Though I thought the mystery closed up a little too quickly, I felt the characters were strong and I would recommend this book. I'm going to look for other books by this author.

1594488916|5.0|Just finished this, and WOW!!<br /><br />I titled my review \\"Stealing Prizes!!\\"  That could be a subtitle for this wonderful work, although it was the actual book title that drew me to the book.  I am a man who, some would say, loves books too much.  Though I don't steal them, I do collect them (1st Edition signed hardcovers).  I call them \\"my prizes.\\"<br /><br />This book arrived in my mailbox and from the moment I opened it, I could not stop reading it.  I lost a good night's sleep thanks to the talents of author Allison Hoover Bartlett. I LITERALLY could not put this down.  This is a detective story with a twist.  We follow the trail of John Charles Gilkey who \\"loves books too much\\"-- if you get my drift.  How he \\"collected\\" his treasures and how he was caught is just fascinating.<br /><br />More than that, Bartlett examines the world of book collecting.  This compendium of book history provides an additional dimension to what is a great true crime drama.<br /><br />If you are a book lover, like me, prepare to be hypnotized, fascinated and ultimately grateful as you explore The Man Who Loved Books Too Much.  Five stars, with no hesitation.

I totally get that my husband and I speak totally different languages.  I used to feel that he couldn't possibly love me but now I see that he is loving me in his language but not mine.  Now I'm more aware of trying to love him in his language.  (Still unsure if he'll learn mine though)
0441017177|5.0|One problem with sci-fi is showing the vastness and mystery of space in an intelligible way. When you think about it, it's hard to conceive of these things, let alone get them across. But Alastair Reynolds's excellent House of Suns solves this problem with aplomb, all the while keeping the pacing taut and the plotting consistent. It's a longish but compelling and efficient book, one which places a premium upon characterization and that is full of cogent insight into the human condition. And, plus, Reynolds has a nice prose style to boot. Writing sci-fi is always a difficult balancing act, and oftentimes the ideas overwhelm everything else. Reynolds is really able to pull it off better than any writer I've read in some time. I highly recommend this book.
B0006HBZXS|3.0|I watched this movie mainly because the premise was good, the action gripping, the scenery breathtaking and it starred Anthony Hopkins. But as soon as I saw that the writer was David Mamet, I knew I was in for it.<br /><br />The plot is rather simple. A billionaire, Charles (Anthony Hopkins), and his wife's secret lover, Bob (Alec Baldwin), get stranded after a plane crash in Alaska. They must cooperate to stay alive, in spite of the fact that Bob is planning on killing Charles to get his wife/money. They decide to hike south to their last known location, but keep getting lost because they can't tell where south is. To complicate matters, they are being stalked by a man-eating bear which has acquired a taste for human flesh after eating a Rastafarian.<br /><br />That was the good part. The bad part was that the amazingly intelligent Charles could not figure out that what one does in this situation is find an open area, make a cross (or something identifiably man-made) with branches, and then keep a fire going nearby (they had matches). (Hey, when Tom Hanks was marooned, he figured all that stuff out--even without matches.) A continual fire would have provided warmth, smoke (for a signal) as well as protection from the bear.<br /><br />But given the assumption that clueless city folks could not come up with this simple strategy, even a rube like me can tell which way south is. The sun rises in the east (southeast during the winter) and sets in the west. Since it wasn't cloudy, it seems like the way south would have been obvious. Just look at the sun, or, if you don't want to go blind, a shadow will do.<br /><br />The stupidities continue. The bear stalks them because Bob doesn't obey orders to bury a blood-soaked rag. (He inexplicably hangs it in a tree, AFTER being informed that there are \\"bear problems\\" in these parts.) Later, Charles WALKS AROUND with a bloody rag on the end of a spear to lure the bear to a trap. Why not just wait, since the bear can sniff out the rag? Why get into a situation where you are forced to outrun a bear? (Impossible, by the way. Even though they did it several times.)<br /><br />Bob gets mauled in one scene, is miraculously healed in the next. Then he impales his leg on a rather large stake, which Charles pulls out the wrong way, but only leaves a little bitty hole. And, of course, Bob leaves a receipt for a watch given to him by Charles' wife (it's engraved with her name and Bob's) in a box containing a gift that Bob has given to Charles. (Obviously, he was thinking that Charles would never find it.) The very fact that Charles still has the box with its perfectly dry receipt after an airplane crash into a lake, falling into rapids, dangling over a chasm, and dashing through woods really stretches credibility. Seriously, people. What idiot wrote this screenplay?<br /><br />David Mamet, of course. Mamet is known for his pithy (i.e. empty) dialogue. \\"It must be hard to be rich,\\" muses Bob. \\"You don't have any buddies.\\" (I'm paraphrasing. I can't bear to replay the scene.) \\"How are you going to kill me?\\" asks Charles. The dialogue went downhill from there, alternating between lame attempts at off-the-cuff wit, dull repetition (\\"Is that what you think? Is that what you think, huh? Is that what you think?\\") and pure hysteria. The interminable \\"We're gonna die out here!!!\\" scenes resembled one of those stereotypical WWII movies in which some guy named \\"Joey\\" blubbers \\"We're gonna die!!\\" (and then gets blown up). Then someone else inevitably screams, \\"They got Joey!!!\\" (and then gets blown up). Mamet's writing isn't far off.<br /><br />On the bright side, Anthony Hopkins is always worth watching, no matter who writes his lines. And the bear was pretty good, too.where you are forced to outrun a bear? (Impossible, by the way. Even though they did it several times.)

031606792X|2.0|I loved the first three books and honestly felt so sad as I began Breaking Dawn because it was to be the last one.  What a disappointment it turned out to be!  Was having a baby so soon the only plot line Ms. Meyer could come up with to create tension for the Cullen family?  There was so little interaction between Edward & Bella except for the occasional hunt.  Sooo many characters, too much time fawning over a baby who morphed into a talking intellectual in two weeks....I just couldn't FEEL anything for her.  This baby took the focus off of Edward & Bella's relationship....the very reason these books had become an obsession.   Edward & Bella became just the catalyst, the spring board to this final episode.  After following their struggle to be together, so much more development should have been spent on the difficulties that lay ahead for them once they made the decision to be together.  In fact I felt they rushed into marriage too soon.  There would have been a wealth of hits and misses in their relationship which would have been great to experience along the way.  Instead we got a quickie marriage and a quickie honeymoon with a lot of pain thrown in.  What happened to the Romance?      We got very little insight into Edward helping Bella cope with being a vampire....instead she seemed to slip right into their way of life....how convenient and boring.  The guilt and strife Edward felt about making Bella a Vampire in the previous books was too quickly settled in Breaking Dawn.  What should have been THE Moment when Edward makes Bella his soul mate became instead a rush to save her life rather than the supreme sacrifice to be together forever. It all became about the baby's welfare as the focus shifted from a Love Story to a Save the Baby Story.  Once Bella started exhibiting signs of pregnancy Ms Meyer lost my attention.  I have nothing against babies but in this particular storyline it seemed out of place and more to the point...premature.     I finally finished Breaking Dawn...not with the anticipation, satisfaction and break neck speed of the first three.....but with little enthusiasm and a whole lot of apathy.  I do hope Ms Meyer finishes Midnight Sun soon.  Maybe I'll be able to reconcile my disappointment with BD when Edward's point of view becomes the focus which is where it should have been all along.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|They year 1986 was a watershed year for comic books. It was the year that people started taking comic books seriously as a form of literature. The reason? Alan Moore's Watchmen (along with Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns) introduced readers to superheroes with real problems. This was a vast departure from the the years of the kid-friendly Super Friends and the campy Adam West Batman television series.<br /><br />When Watchmen hit, that all changed. Hailed for its deconstruction and examination of superhero tropes, it won a Hugo Award in 1988 and it is the only graphic novel to be listed by Time as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century.<br /><br />Naturally, Hollywood wanted in on the action, and attempts to make a Watchmen movie have continued since its publication. However, they were never able to crack the Watchmen nut. How do you take such a layered, complex book like Watchmen and turn it into a two-hour movie? How much would the material need to be changed? What elements would need to be left out? Many concepts were pitched - making it a buddy film centered on Rorschach and Nite-Owl, getting rid of crucial characters, setting the film in a contemporary setting instead of the 80's, the list goes on. Several directors were involved. After attempting to make his own Watchmen movie, Paul Greengrass ultimately deemed Watchmen \\"unfilmable.\\"<br /><br />But Zack Snyder, who had just come off the huge success of directing another graphic novel adaptation with 300, stepped forward and was given the task to film the unfilmable. Using the graphic novel itself as the film's storyboard, Snyder succeeded. His Watchmen film is as faithful to the graphic novel as you can expect. The Comedian is still a cynic who takes pleasure in his violent \\"crimebusting\\", Rorschach is still a brutal vigilante who sees everything in black-and-white morality (and is played with fury and intensity by a resurgent Jackie Earle Haley in the film's standout performance), Nite-Owlstill can't \\"get it up\\" without being in his superhero costume, and Dr. Manhattan is still as naked as a jaybird and apathetic to the plight of humanity.<br /><br />Most of the film's departures from the graphic novel are understandable. The graphic novel's out-of-deep-left-field finale involving a cataclysmic event is altered, though the goals and motives behind it are unchanged. This new ending actually makes more sense and ties to the characters much better, but it still doesn't quite have the gut-punch shock that the book's end had. Perhaps this has more to do with the fact that Snyder is forced to cram as much into the film as possible while trying to keep the film's runtime from getting too long that the audience isn't given much time to really absorb it.<br /><br />Another element that Snyder has included in this film is moments of horror-movie gore that almost seem out of place. Perhaps the book's violence lends itself to a very violent film interpretation, but I felt Snyder (who directed the remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead) may have gone overboard during a few moments, like Nite-Owl breaking a thug's arm to the point that the bones burst through the flesh. Ouch.<br /><br />The Director's Cut adds nearly a half an hour of footage that Snyder was forced to cut to keep the film under three hours. Most of this footage comes in the form of lengthened scenes. In one, Rorschach's investigation of The Comedian's apartment is interrupted by the police and a fight ensues, and Rorschach's questioning by Dr. Malcolm is longer. Hollis Mason's sad and brutal death at the hands of a street gang is also reinserted in the Director's Cut, a scene I was disappointed to hear that it was omitted from the theatrical version.<br /><br />This version of the Blu-Ray comes with a handful of featurettes that reflect on the graphic novel's impact on comic books. Another examines the psychology and cultural impact of actual vigilantes like New York's Guardian Angels, BernardGoetz, as well as the recent trend of \\"real life superheroes\\" who dress up in costume and patrol their neighborhoods. One featurette even delves into the real scientific basis behind the elements of the Watchmen world.<br /><br />For me, the best feature would have to be the special commentary performed by Zack Snyder himself, who will step in during the film and explain aspects of the film's production as opposed to just giving a voice-only commentary. Then the audience has the option to view a vignette about that aspect of the film or continue watching the film.<br /><br />This Amazon-exclusive version of Watchmen: Director's Cut comes in a replica of the Owlship, Nite-Owl's hovering vehicle, which emits lights and sounds with the press of a button. The Owlship itself can be removed from its base, and I'm sure your kids would like to run around the house with the Owlship in their hands pretending it can fly (note: Watchmen is an R-rated film and NOT for children, but i'm sure kids will still get a kick out of playing with the Owlship).<br /><br />There is a Digital Copy for your computers and iPods, but I was disappointed to find that it is of the theatrical version and NOT the Director's Cut.<br /><br />There is an \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of Watchmen being released around Christmas, which will include the animated \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" feature spliced into the film as it appears in the graphic novel, so if you want a copy of Watchmen: DIrector's Cut that will give you the most bang for your buck until it comes out, the Amazon-exclusive Owlship version is probably the best way to go.

014144116X|5.0|Almost a century after the book's publication the most crucial problems it discussed are as current as they were during Forster's life. The impossibility of communicating across the divide of culture, religion, and race, seems to be even more alive then when he saw it. The value of the novel lies not so much in representing it but in the fact that Forster offers a way out - personal contact.<br />The story takes us to India of the 1920s - we follow the path of a young Englishwoman who goes to marry a British official but wants to know \\"the real India\\". This she never achieves but she gets to know something by far more important - herself. Her inept attempts at connecting with India and Indians make other characters of the novel learn more about themselves, force them out of safe shells in which they lived. The lesson is painful but at least for some of the characters opens the door to a better life.<br />There is little chance people will suddenly like Muslims, Pakistanis, gays, lesbians, Moroccans, Turkish, Kurds etc etc - there is a chance (a very slim chance, Forster would be quick to add) that a specific American and a specific Muslim, a Turk and a Kurd, an Israeli and a Palestinian can be friends. The world may not want it, the people that surround them may not want it but the results depend on us alone. If we do not try we only have ourselves to blame.
B001FB55H6|3.0|For those of us that own the format with a solid A/V set up, I was expecting a reference quality disc that would better serve a story that was simply too big for a 2 hour movie; not to mention this was the guy that did 300. The Blue Ray exceeded my expectations in some areas and fails in others.     From a feature standpoint, watching Zak Snyder explain everything is awesome and I'd love to see some of the more colorful directors in Hollywood do the same (Tarantino on Kill Bill's action sequences comes to mind). It's a great use of the format and not possible on standard DVD format. There are some additional featurettes that are also worth watching and a digital copy for travel on the laptop. The extra 25 minutes should have been in the theatrical version as it only adds to each of the characters that get more screen time.  5/ 5 stars for extras.     From a sound and video standpoint, it's okay, not great. The Dark Knight not only set the bar for comic based movies, but for Blu Ray as well with reference quality scenes scattered throughout. Although shown in IMAX, scenes were not filmed in IMAX, so this is a straight forward transfer. Zak Snyder's imagery is amazing, but as far as the transfer goes, it's not as good as the Dark Knight or even Snyder's own 300. The explosions and action will rock your system and soundtrack is dynamite. It does suffer from very quiet dialogue Don't get me wrong, it looks and sounds good, just not as good as I was expecting. 3 / 5 stars.     I'll comment on the movie as well. I'm a fan of the graphic novel and I appreciate the scene for scene recreation. BUT. ..I am one of the many who felt like this was too big for the theater. Had this been a 5 part miniseries, or maybe 8 part with the Black Freighter mixed in, I think it would have been better. If HBO could get the Sookie Stackhouse novels done, why not Watchmen? Some of the depth is just missing, making the movie feel cold and heartless. I also thought that the movie was terribly cast. I have no problem with the casting of B level actors or smaller names (Brandon Routh as Superman or Heath Ledger as the Joker).  Rorshack, Dr. Manhatten and The Comedian were great. Daniel was okay, but Laurie and Ozzy were just terrible. The movie hinged on the chemistry between Daniel and Laurie to give the movie an emotional connection and it's never there. The graphic novel depicted Ozzymandais as a big, strong, charismatic genius, not a bean pole whose mask was wider than his head. The movie just has no soul and feels empty. 2.5/5 stars for looking and sounding great, but having very uneven performances.
1423101472|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians, a Young Adult Urban Fantasy, written by Rick Riordan and published by Disney  Hyperion for Children is a New York Times selling five book series.  Riordan re-imagines many of the Greek tales and myths and repackages them into a modern urban fantasy revolving around a few young demi-god - halfblood - heroes.  The main protagonist, Percy Jackson, is a young, newly discovered halfblood, and son of one of the Greek gods - who really do exist and live in the clouds above the Empire State Building in Olympus.<br /><br />The first book in the series, The Lightening Thief, introduces us to Percy, his friends and other demi-gods at Camp Halfblood, and Riordan's retold Greek pantheon.  Riordan wastes no time jumping into the action and adventure in this first book, while quickly building not only the mystery and plot for this first story, but laying out his hero's quest for the next four books.<br /><br />Riordan's characters are well crafted and likable.  His take on the gods, monsters, heroes, and Greek Myths are witty, quirky, and sometimes laugh out loud funny.  He seamlessly draws you into his world of teenage superheroes - descended from gods, minotaurs, titans, and Medusa.  He carries the mystery, suspense, and adventure through five books with apparent ease.<br /><br />Percy is aided in his quest to save the gods of Olympus by Annabeth, the daughter of Athena, Grover, the satyr, as well as many other sons and daughters of the gods.  Their travels and adventures take them to the Underworld, across the Sea of Monsters, and through the Labyrinth, all the while facing monsters and characters from ancient mythology.<br /><br />If your a fan of Greek Mythology, and honestly who isn't, than you're sure to enjoy Riordan's take and re-visioning.<br /><br />At times Camp Halfblood feels like another take on Hogwarts, a Greek/American version of the school for Wizards and Witches disguised as half-god superheroes, but none the less the story Riordan has created does not have any less charm or mastery.  I truly enjoyed reading Percy Jackson's tale and waited anxiously for the release of each title in the series.  I was utterly disappointed when the series concluded and only hope that Riordan with entertain us with more takes down the road.<br /><br />For now, I'll assuage my need for Percy Jackson tales by looking forward to the movie due out in early 2010.  Please view the trailer below and please give Percy Jackson and the Olympians a chance, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />[...]harm or mastery.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|The early 1970's was a time in Hollywood in which many studios developed disaster films and had many screen stars play roles in which their characters were in situations of peril. \\"Earthquake\\", \\"Airport '75\\", and \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" all filled the public's appetite for these kinds of epics, and many of them are now regarded as true cinema classics. \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is probably the best of the lot as far as disaster flicks are concerned: we have a star-studded cast, great special effects, and the disaster in this case is that a huge sky rise is ablaze with people trapped. The film features Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, Robert Wagner, and many more, but it was a current soap opera star that stole the entire movie from these Hollywood icons: Susan Flannery, who was at that time starring on \\"Days of Our Lives\\" as Laura, plays a secretary who is having an affair with the Robert Wagner character. Her demise in \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is one of those virtuoso performances rarely seen on screen. Flannery would win a Golden Globe for \\"Inferno\\" as Best Newcomer.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses, the best being exclusive interviews with the cast and crew on how the movie came to be. The film is cleaned from its original print and looks impeccable. Too bad more films would have the same DVD bonus treatment like \\"The Towering Inferno\\"! This DVD is a two disc set that features 9 new featurettes, audio commentary, over 30 extended and deleted scenes, and much more. As a bonus too there a lobby cards included.<br /> Daily Variety says that \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is \\"one of the greatest disaster pictures made\\".
B0007MWZEK|2.0|This product picks up small pieces of dirt and debris on a low pile carpet or bare floor very well. I also like the dirt \\"escape hatch\\" that releases to have the dirt fall into the trash without having to get my hands dirty. However, 2 months into owning this unit, the battery began failing to charge. Now I have to go out and spend more money on a replacement rechargeable battery.
0143034901|4.0|I had been hesitant to pick up this novel.  People who had read it had told me it was good, but they sounded lukewarm about it.  There are too many average novels out there and I don't like to waste my time on them.  Now there is all this buzz about his second novel \\"Angel's Game\\" and I thought I might as well read his first novel. I must admit this was a fun and engrossing read.  There is a lot to admire about this book and the ending isn't such a letdown like so many other novels that seem to be promising thrillers. I would think that most people who take the time to review a book on Amazon, must love books so the plot of Zafon's novel was already a win-win for the reading audience. \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" has all of the elements: mystery, intrigue, romance, politics, suspense, but it's not without it's flaws. There were times when I felt his writing style was bit contrived. Some characters were too melodramatic and others weren't developed enough. Also, there are some coincidental circumstances that detract the storyline and make it weak at times. Still, I highly recommend this novel because it does succeed in being interesting and has enough suspense to keep the reader turning the pages. Without a \\"shadow\\" of a doubt, you'll enjoy this novel.
0394800184|1.0|This book is so awful it prompted me to write my first review.  I almost wonder whether I read the same book as the folks who gave this book favorable reviews.  This shamelessly dull book is poorly written and illustrated.  It was a burden to own until I finally threw it out for the extra space on the bookshelf.  This is not a Dr. Seuss book and doesn't contain any of the usual catchy Seusslike rhymes or illustrations.  Buy 'Is Your Mama a Llama?' instead and look at this book at your library just to see how laughably bad it really is.
0307408833|4.0|My daughter and husband have wheat/sugar/dairy allergies, so this cookbook has been great to find.  I have made the blueberry muffins(whole family adored!), gingerbread , ginger snaps, and strawberry shortcake with the vanilla sauce.  All have been very good! Be warned the ingredients are pricey and until you get stocked with wheat-free flours-a bit of a pain.  Nothing I have made has been as pretty as the pictures, but they have all tasted great!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The idea of an external computer device with dedicated buttons for various features has been around for a while, and it is a good one.  It is easier and more ergonomic to use with a mouse than bouncing around on a keyboard with one hand.  Logitech has managed to take this idea and do it one better, improving the interface and adding a built in screen for useful information.<br /><br />As expected the device fits well ergonomically.  The keys are easy to reach regardless of hand size, and the joystick works well, although clicking can be tricky at first.  The \\"home row\\" of the middle keys can be easily located by touch due to handy indentations.  The screen is highly functional, and not cheesy at all.  Customizable backlighting is nifty as well.<br /><br />The software is highly customizable as well.  3 sets of profiles, for a total of 66 customizeable button presses, open a lot of possibilities.  Not only is this device is great for gaming, but it is useful in other applications as well.  I reserve one profile for office functions, such as \\"CTRL-X\\" and \\"CTRL-V\\" (cut and paste) at the touch of a button.  You can program macros to launch programs, open websites, and plenty of other possibilities.<br /><br />Overall this is a quality product and highly recommended to boost your gaming performance and overall productivity.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I was impressed with how well this movie wound together so many different things. It managed to be adequately suspenseful, sensual, and historical. I was fond of the costumes and the authenticity of the WWII. Recently I watched Defiance and it looked like they were 'trying' to look WWII. This movie pulled it off.
B001DETHK6|1.0|This review speaks only to the quality of the ultra expensive, Japanese SHM CD version of Trilogy. Look for another version of this c.d.. The hiss that is present during and between songs is unbelievable. It is as bad as listening to an  old cassette tape. I am blessed to own the MFSL version which I assume is still the gold standard of this c.d..I purchased this edition on a lark because it was touted that \\"you won't believe it's the same c.d.\\". Well, they were right but for the wrong reason. This is a 10 star title that deserves better.
0525951113|2.0|As an avid reader a lot of books go through my hands. It takes a LOT for me to actually want to write a bad review about one on Amazon. Amazing set up and concept (which is why I give this two stars), that midway through the book just takes a turn for the outlandish and so far fetched it just becomes ludicrous. SYFY would not even produce storylines this bad. And it starts well..thats the sad part. Until you get halfway through it is a great read, but after that half way mark it becomes a runaway train that destroys the book.    Its just awfull. After the huge reveal of who was being \\"set-up\\" I kept reading praying it would make sense or get better. It didn't. The last 30 pages will make you feel stupid for finishing the book.    The author tried to cross books by Daniel Keys Moran, with Foundation's predictive Omniknowledge of Harri Seldon, and an overabundence of MMORPG imagery and terms that at times seemed inserted to simply make the author look \\"cool\\" and \\"knowledgeable.\\" Cunning Technologiocal thriller? Trendy Science Fiction story?     I cannot believe that the people who agreed to publish this actually read the story to the end.
B0027WNRVI|1.0|For those who rated this high because you bought the import version, well, you didn't wait long enough.

B000V6I7WG|4.0|Acting could have been a little better in several parts but overall it was good enough to deliver the story. The story was bizarre & that's what made the flick. This movie is not for everybody. Blu-ray visual was very good as was the sound. I would recommend this product for people that are looking for something other than the average Hollywood formula.
0671449028|5.0|Our two-year-old son got this as a gift and I just recently discovered it. I started reading it to him as part of his \\"night-night\\" ritual (and sometimes as part of his naptime prep). The rhymes are simple (and strict--one of the things I hate is when children's book authors cheat the meter) and memorable: he was filling in words (\\"wall,\\" \\"up,\\" \\"deep\\") within a few readings. So not only is it enjoyable to read, but it's rewarding as well. For both of us. Boynton's distinctive drawing style is a bonus. Frankly, I don't see how you can go wrong with this book. I'll be buying more Boynton books very soon.<br /><br />Update: He's 5 now. I memorized the whole book very quickly, and even now I'll recite it as he drifts off. He knows most of the book by heart as well. I love it.
0316017922|3.0|This book attributes much of an individual's success to being in the right place at the right time and to showing great persistence. Not exactly rocket science that. I also found the argument for success in mathematics to be quite thin - that numbers should be brief and consistent - the French after all say sixty, sixty plus ten and four twenties for 60, 70 and 80 and they are no slouches at mathematical achievement.    Mr Gladwell has troubles of his own with maths. He talks of standing in a rice paddy the size of a hotel room and he tells us that 15 rice paddies make up a hectare (or about 6 paddies to the acre for those of you who use feet and inches). It must be that lightweight scientific studies like this book pay very well, if the hotel room you are now used to measures 22m x 30m or 72' x 100'.
B000025K44|5.0|And to think that Michael Jackson's debut album came when he was really just a kid! Michael is in top form on these tracks and he never misses a beat. In general, I think the backup singers enhance the songs--not that Michael ever really needed backup; but they do sound pretty good anyway. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and the artwork is good, too.<br /><br />The album starts off with Michael singing his heart out on \\"Ain't No Sunshine.\\" Michael's voice is strong and the lush musical arrangement is just right for his vocals. The backup singers harmonize to perfection--and beyond! Overall, \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" is a strong beginning track for this CD. \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\" by Leon Ware and Arthur \\"T-Boy\\" Ross is packed with energy; Michael sings this faultlessly and he handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro he was and still remains! \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\" is easily a major highlight of this album.<br /><br />\\"In Our Small Way\\" is very easy on the ear for this hopeful love song; Michael aces this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. Of course, we know that it really wasn't all that easy; Michael's talent always carried him through. I love it! In addition, the title track, \\"Got to Be There\\" impresses me immensely. MJ sings this incredibly well and the melody is very pretty. \\"Rockin' Robin\\" is yet another tune packed with energy; its fantastic arrangement combines Michael's singing with some really fine music to make this a pop masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Wings of My Love\\" uses the strings to great advantage; and Michael sings this with all his heart and soul. Michael's cover of a number made famous by The Supremes, \\"Love Is Here and Now You're Gone,\\" sparkles like silver and gold combined in his capable hands; and it's another major highlight of this album. \\"You've Got a Friend\\" ends the album with Michael doing a superlative job of placing his own stamp on this Carole King ballad; he plays a little bit with the tempo and the keys to make this song his own. Great!<br /><br />Michael Jackson's music always made me feel elated; and it always will. I highly recommend this for his fans; and even newcomers to MJ will like this awesome CD.his own. Great!

B0001CNRBG|5.0|Based on the 1975 Bernard Slade play of the same name, this screen adaptation stars Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn as a pair of married lovers, who meet once each year for 26 years. Though a movie about marital infidelity may not be one's cup of tea, this movie works because it doesn't focus so much on the lust-driven aspect of the affair, but more about two people who find themselves in a circumstance where they really care for each other, yet are strongly committed to their marriages. Alan Alda plays George, a married accountant with three kids, while Ellen Burstyn plays Doris, a California housewife.<br /><br />The pair's relationship evolves over the course of 26 years, as each time they meet [in the movie, it kind of jumps every couple of years or so, beginning with 1951, then on to 1956...1961 etc], viewers get to see how George and Doris have 'grown' as individuals, and also how the years have shaped their relationship. They develop an intimacy that goes beyond physical closeness, sharing pieces of each other's lives, and confiding their innermost desires and worries. I truly came to care about both of these characters.<br /><br />This is a movie that I first watched a few years ago, never knowing of its existence until I saw it on Netflix. And since then, I've watched it numerous times - drawn in part to the great comic chemistry shared between Burstyn and Alda, and also the wonderful soundtrack and archival footage of historical events through the years 1951-1977. This is one that will have you laughing and crying!
1401308201|5.0|So if you're this kind of person: I'm a big fan of the musical, but not quite the \\"I showed up fifteen times to watch and stood in line at the stage door for an hour to meet the whole cast\\" type. Most of the purchases I make are practical, and though I like learning a lot about things I like and think this book would add to my experience, I don't want to drop 27 dollars for it.    So if you're that kind of person, I would just say, treat yourself to this book! I'm pretty practical as well, and when I saw that they were selling this at the theatre for $50, I decided not to spend the money. I came home and checked Amazon for cheaper prices, and found this one for $27. As someone with an artistic eye who works in publishing, I found the book to be absolutely beautiful, very well done, with a lot of information that I haven't seen anywhere else on the internet (because where else do you read about Wicked?). I especially enjoyed the interviews with the different actors playing the main characters, hearing how each of them has interpreted his or her role and re-owned it. There are short segments of the libretto, but not nearly the whole thing.    Overall, I enjoyed this not too expensive purchase and would recommend it to anyone who considers him or herself to be a fan of the musical. It truly adds to the enjoyment, and it is a very well done piece of publication.
B000P0J024|5.0|I love this CD/DVD set!  I bought it for my husband, and while he enjoys it very much, I have listened to it more than he has!!!

0307269981|5.0|The late Stieg Larsson has sold a lot of books worldwide.  And deservedly so.  The \\"Millenium\\" crime novels--of which he delivered three, plus sketches of several others prior to his fatal heart attack in 2004--really set the standard for the genre.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is the second in the posthumous series, following the also terrific \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  \\"Fire\\" is even better than the first and was awarded the 2006 prize for best Swedish Crime Novel (the novels were originally publish is Swedish).  Once again featuring disturbed, punk, computer-hacker Lisbeth Salander and middle-aged journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Larsson delivers a fast-paced and terrific mystery that begins with the murder of a young couple working on a dissertation and book about sex-trafficking in Sweden.  The reader learns much more about Salander's troubled life as she flees and is identified by police as the prime suspect.  Blomkvist continues to use his journalistic and investigative skills (he is a modern day Holmes) as he proclaims his belief that Salander is innocent.  This is a fast paced book with many twists and turns and quite a few surprises.  Very highly recommended.
031606792X|5.0|Were do i begin! this book has it all action suspense love heartbreak... the list can go on forever.

B001U7FWM8|5.0|One, this album is dense yes, but extremely rewarding. Give it some time and space to take root in your skull, and it will flower. It's one of the best albums of 2009 without question. The song-craft, arrangements, and production are mind-blowing; listen both in headphones and in your car at full blast. The album artwork is beautiful, also.     Two, don't review albums from their previews, that's just stupid stupid stupid. The artists have taken an incredible amount of time from their lives to craft this work, you are being stupid stupid if you listen to one tiny slice and then pass judgment.  Please only review the album if you have heard the whole thing at least a few times.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|When the Watchmen movie came out it a lot of fans of the graphic novel that spawned it said that to appreciate the movie it was better to have already read the novel. Movies need to stand on their own, they can't rely on source material to fill in the blanks of plot or characterization. But that seems an excuse, because that's not what's happening here. I think The Watchmen tries to tell too many stories at one time.<br /><br />The Watchmen follows Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley who plays a very convincing psychopathic super hero detective. He's trying to solve the murder of The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan), one of the original Watchmen, superhero's from the 40's. We follow him through plot and subplot of a post-modern 1985 where Richard Nixon is running for his fifth term as President of U. S. and the world teeters on the edge of nuclear destruction. And we meet Watchmen old and new, Carla Cugino who plays Sally Jupiter who was the Watchman Silk Spectre in the 40's who was almost raped by The Comedian and now lives out her days in an alcoholic fog her memories of the past getting brighter with each passing day. Then there's Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) billionaire, worlds smartest man and the hero Ozymandis with an Alexander the Great complex. And there's the love interest of Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter played by the VERY attractive Malin Akerman and Nite Owl II whose day name is Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson). Unfortunately, these two have no chemistry, their love scene seemed superfluous, and I really couldn't believe the flabby, nearsighted Dan Dreiberg could be any kind of super hero by night.<br /><br />Besides the already mentioned performance of Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup submerges himself into Dr. Manhattan, there are a lot of special effects surrounding Crudup's performance in this but I think it is an outstanding low key performance. Of course  Manhattan is a man whose humanity is submerging as his powers set him farther and farther away from anyone, let alone anyone who loves him.<br /><br />Watchmen also grapples with a lot issues such as, does God exist? The nature of man? And the contradiction of love in the world. When the Watchmen aren't grappling with the nature of good and evil they're usually illustrating the dark side of man's nature, including the sympathetic Dr. Manhattan who does some very nasty things to people. Of course it can be argued in his case human beings are becoming inconsequential to him as he sees the macro picture. The sense of humor in the Watchmen is wicked, Richard Nixon's fifth term in office?<br /><br />Sin City grappled with some of the same themes, a movie that came from graphic novel with devastatingly flawed hero's who aren't even sure they are hero's until push comes to shove. But Sin City didn't try to squeeze in the whole series of novels instead they picked and chose among the major tales for a slightly episodic feeling movie that in the end tied up the stories nicely. The Watchmen doesn't hold together as cohesively and in a place or two drops the thread.<br /><br />If you're looking for a superhero movie for your kids, this isn't it. There's a lot of masochistic (albeit cartoonish) violence, and the Watchmen have very flawed and compromised personalities, this is definitely not for younger children. And as for adults or anyone interested in seeing the Watchmen it's definitely a rental.nyone who loves him.    Watchmen also grapples with a lot issues such as, does God exist? The nature of man?

B00288KNLS|5.0|Coraline is a beautiful, disturbing, and original movie that is definitely TOO SCARY for children younger than 10 years old. However, it should NOT be missed by anyone who remembers how wonderful and scary it was to experience the world through the eyes of a child.<br />  The story is not complex, but it's important to keep in mind that \\"plot\\" is not the point. This movie is all about experiencing the fantastic characters and their amazing/terrifying world. If you like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" or the Harry Potter books, then you will probably enjoy Coraline. The stop-motion puppetry is first rate and the set pieces are breathtaking. Much of the movie is scored by a Hungarian children's choir, which goes a long way to creating a constant feeling of apprehension. The voice acting is superb.<br />  In short, Coraline is less of a movie and more an experience. If it's ever re-released to theaters in 3-D, please go see it. You won't be disappointed.
B001GCUER0|5.0|This is still one of the most entertaining shows on TV, with each episode having the look and feel of a film. The actors are as superb as ever, with Jon Hamm going deeper into the character of Don Draper (Dick Whitman), his past, the wife of the man he accidentally knocked off, and his extramarital dalliances.  The Draper kids and their perpetually dissatisfied, sometimes mean, and rather cold mother get more screen time, while the character of Peggy Olsen really shines this time around as the season culminates in her revelation to the oily Peter Campbell.    Christina Hendricks is also a powerhouse as office manager Joan, whose fiancee turns out to be less than desirable, while the supporting cast members turn in solid work all around.    The soundtrack is always appropriate, and it's a fascinating look at the world as it was nearly 50 years ago, Cuban missile crisis and all.    Madly intriguing.
0440244870|5.0|I truly didn't expect much out of \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\\" but, since I enjoyed the movie, I decided to give the book a try. The main character, Becky Bloomwood, makes the book. She is the most endearing character I have read to date-- so unaware of herself but with such a big heart that you can't help but love her. Though the movie is nothing like the book, Isla Fisher plays this character to a tee. The plot comes together a little too nicely, but, somehow, it all makes sense in Becky's world.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|I've never been a fan of futuristic movies, with there usual weird clothing made out of plastic rings from 6 packs and held together with large safety pins.  This movie was different and truly enjoyable, in spite of some of the more gory scenes.  It was a good story to begin with, set not that far into the future.  2012 is described to have some social issues that are already in play now, in 2009.  I'm a grandmother, but I thought this movie was a fun ride.  Jason Statham is my new favorite movie hero.  The support cast was great and Joan Allen - well, it was not the same Joan Allen from \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" or even \\"Faceoff\\" - who knew she could play such a quiet, yet lethal, villain.  I think I enjoyed the fact that stunts were real and CGI was limited.  A true action movie with plenty of action.  I thought it was great and can't wait for my husband to see it too.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|And that's because it's so good! I loved this movie, though I did find it a bit depressing.

0790733226|5.0|I rate Contact (1997) a five star film which featured wonderful Jodie Foster. This movie played well on a conventional TV, but did not hold up well on a LCD 52\\" HDTV and upward compatible DVD player. If you really love this film the way I do, I would suggest definitely getting it in Blu Ray.<br /><br />I can't say enough about what a fine job was done in making this film. Jodie Foster was able to perform in a totally synthetic environment while delivering (I think) one of her finest performances, delivering a breathless rapture suitable for the cosmic occasion presented. The computer graphics were the best and totally believable. Overall, the cast, direction, pacing, CGI were great and the special effects were meticulously done. The musical score and story were just great.<br /><br />The film was dedicated to Carl Sagan who wrote the original book and helped with the screenplay and is a fine testimonial to the man.<br /><br />I went to the single star reviews and found that this movie was rated as a stinker by a considerable number of people, some of which down rated it because of the compromises it made regarding the fact that Sagan was apparently a registered atheist! They appeared to be upset that this film made some kind of case for faith. It did not make a case for religion, however, and just implied that certain \\"human experiences\\" can never be proven to the satisfaction of a scientist.<br /><br />The human condition of personal experience still exists, despite the condition described in the film as \\"the self reinforcing delusion\\". I started out in my early years as a strong faith based person, and now that I am a considerably older person find myself becoming more of an agnostic with time, despite the approach of mortality. I don't deny Hollywood the right to make a compromise between faith and evidence for marketing purposes, or whatever. I agree with the gist of the statement that Ellie made about her lack of belief in god. There is insufficient evidence for a scientist to prove either case.r case.

0812979656|4.0|Rahel is an adult now, returning to her childhood home after a long absence.  The home, in India, is the source of all grief in her life, the place of a tragic death that tore apart her family and caused her twin brother to be sent away from her when they were children.    Much of this book tells of a short time in the lives of Rahel and her brother Estha, twins who are so close they can sometimes read each other's minds.  They think of themselves as one person, a part of each other.  They are excited because their cousin, a glamorous girl from England who everyone in the family loves without ever having met, is coming for a visit.  Life revolves around preparing for Sophie Mol's trip to India.    When Sophie Mol arrives, though, things go rapidly downhill in the lives of all family members, and the tragic fallout pulls the twins apart for over two decades.    This story is beautiful and devastating.  The descriptions of the twins, their home, and their family are riveting.  Even though I knew from the start of the story that Rahel and Estha were going to be involved in a tragedy and end up split apart, I still found this book to be incredibly suspenseful.    I didn't understand, though, why Rahel and Estha didn't take control of their lives earlier.  They met each other again when they were over thirty years old; I found myself wondering why they hadn't sought each other out much earlier, since being apart was such a primary source of their shared grief.

I love it and it's a strandard staple in my collection. My fav tune has to be Hey, mama. I think I will check out their new one, [[ASIN:B00192IV0O THE E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies)]].
0802130208|5.0|In New Orleans, a great deal of characters congregate.  In this story we meet Darlene, desperate to be a dancer at a bar; Jones, trying to get a job and avoid going to jail as a vagrant; Mancuso, a police officer trying to get recognition for his hard work; and Miss Trixie, confusedly trying to retire from her job.      In the middle of this cast of characters and connecting them all is Ignatious J. Reilly.  Unlike those trying to get ahead in the world, Ignatious is doing his best to not do anything at all.  He lives with his mother and spends his time overflowing the bathtub, demanding soda and baked goods, and ranting and writing about the stupidity of everyone around him.  Ignatious thinks himself the tortured genius, downtrodden and unrecognized for his true self.  He must be one of the most deplorable and amusing main characters in all of literature.    When Ignatious' mother needs money, she finally commands her grown son to find a job.  Ignatious tries his best to avoid work, but finds himself falling into a couple of jobs that end up going horribly, ridiculously, wrong.    In the end of the story, the lives of all of the various characters are pulled together in an extremely satisfying way.  What an excellent book!

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I have never read the graphic novel and most likely never will. I am just not into that art form, no offense to those who are, but I did want to see this film, mostly out of curiosity, so I rented it today and watched it.   From the beginning, it is clear they spared no expense in making this film. This is one gorgeous film to watch from the cinematography to the effects to the direction, I can find no fault.   The story is complex and layered, unlike any other superhero film I have seen. In fact, the closest would be The Dark Knight and even that is a simple film by comparison, fine though it is. I loved the parallel America idea, where things were just a little bit 'off' but still highly recognizable, a timeline where we had the super heroes and yet the realities of nuclear war were, ironically enough, even more likely. Clearly, the writers did not just throw this movie together and put a lot of thought into it.   The characters are almost too human and I mean that as a compliment. They make mistakes, they are an unusual mix of those who revel in killing to those who question their own morality and of course Dr. Manhattan, who is slowly losing any link to humanity. On the surface, they are the typical comic book heroes, dressed up in the funny costumes, posing for the pictures, looking like they are expected to look. From within, they are all battling demons, none more so than the contrasting darkness of time expiring juxtaposed to the time that once was, the time of youth, when everything was so much more alive, so much more colorful. I think the film does this very well.   It is a violent film and this more than anything caught me off guard. Sure, I noticed it was rated R but that did not fully prepare me for the amount and the intensity of the violence. I do think at times it did go a bit over the top and I could have done without a few of these scenes.   Going along with the R rating, these superheroes actually think about sex and engage in it, one a violent attempted rape and one a fairly explicit but tastefully done love scene.   The violence, the swearing, the sex. Tim Burton's Batman seems very very tame by comparison.   Some of the acting was a bit over the top but that is to be expected, I think, for the characters almost seem compelled to behave in a certain way contrary to who they really are. Comedian, for example, seemed to me as totally lost even though he came across to the other heroes as the most certain, the most grounded, the most realistic, even if it was viewed as cynical. I could go on about each as they all had their fascinating aspects but suffice to say I thought each character, each actor, did a very good job.   To sum up, I think Watchmen is a fascinating, exciting, atypical superhero film and an incredibly pleasant surprise.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|Like other reviewers, I agree with the fact that this movie sucks.<br />This is not a horror movie!<br /><br />What you get is :<br />Young women's scenes being hit by perverts the whole time.<br />A woman get removed all her skin.<br />In fact it's a movie made by some degenerate director of French cinema<br />that he/she doesn't have neither the most minimum idea of what is the cinema of horror.<br /><br />If you want to see horror cinema look for<br />George Romero or Wes Craven titles as examples<br />of what a horror movie is about it.
B001SN78JO|3.0|Jim Carrey is an iconic comedian. Like it or lump it, he has forever left his mark on Hollywood with films like \\"Ace Ventura,\\" \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" and \\"Man on the Moon,\\" but since the turn of the century Jim has been wasting away with duds like \\"Me, Myself, and Irene\\" and \\"Fun with Dick and Jane.\\" Granted, he's put in some great dramatic performances during this time, notably \\"Eternal Sunshine\\", but his attempts at diving back into the genre that made him a movie star have been unadulterated failures.<br /><br />Where, then, does \\"Yes Man\\" stack up? Is it a worthy ode to the Jim Carrey that we all fell in love with in the mid-90s, or yet another film in which Jim Carrey appears to be doing an imitation of himself? I'm happy to say that while it falls somewhere in the middle, it's certainly Jim's best comedy since \\"Liar Liar,\\" and is actually fairly close to that movie in both concept and enjoyment.<br /><br />Carrey plays Carl, a recently-divorced loan officer who has become all too comfortable with denying the requests of anyone, both at work and in his personal life. He has resigned himself to spending his time away from others, forgoing any and all opportunities that exist outside his palatial bachelor pad. He's watched his ex-wife find love again, and while he clearly misses the feeling, he isn't in the right headspace for finding it himself.<br /><br />After a somewhat clunky opening act, Carl finds himself at a \\"Yes Man\\" seminar, during which he is told to \\"allow 'Yes' into his life.\\" After this bizarre presentation by Terrence Stamp, Jim reluctantly finds himself saying \\"yes\\" to whatever proposals come his way. He gives all of his pocket money to a homeless man, starts handing out loans at work with reckless abandon, and even takes up an elderly woman on an...offer.<br /><br />Predictably, Carl's life is rejuvenated, and he finds himself satisfied with himself for the first time in a while. Although the plot moves along pretty much how you'd expect, Carrey is in fine form here. The laughs come often and are sometimes of the gut-wrenching variety. Zooey Deschanel is delightfully droll in her role as Alison, the quirky foil to the often insipid Carl.<br /><br />Before watching the film, the concept of saying \\"yes\\" to anything seemed to me like an excuse to throw Carrey into the most ridiculous predicaments imaginable, just to watch how he'd fair in such situations. But as the movie progressed I found myself thinking seriously about the concept itself, and how much value one could actually extract out of such a philosophy. The concept serves as a gimmick, sure, but it also provides a worthwhile commentary on apathy and how destructive it can be. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a film that will change your life, but the concept is smarter than one might assume.<br /><br />As far as supporting roles go, the best performance of the entire film--one that I'd even recommend a viewing based solely on--is that of Rhys Darby, who plays Carl's boss Norman. His character is much like his portrayal of Murray from \\"Flight of the Concords,\\" meaning that humor is derived solely from his New Zealand accent poured over amusing innocence. He had me in stitches every time he was on the screen.<br /><br />Other than Darby, there aren't any other notable performances to speak of. Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson play Carl's best friends, but their roles are very minimal, almost to the point of being irrelevant. They largely serve as the locus of Carl's apathy, but little more. It's too bad, as I like both of these actors, and I think the film could have benefitted from us seeing more of them (and Masterson's killer 'stache).<br /><br />Ultimately, the film was set up to succeed or fail on the backs of Carrey and Deschanel. Thankfully, they're great, both apart and, especially, together. They had a chemistry that I wasn't quite expecting. If you're a fan of either, then I'm sure that you'll enjoy \\"Yes Man.\\"<br /><br />VERDICT: Rent Itme often and are sometimes of the gut-wrenching variety.

B00288KNJU|4.0|Well, our whole family loved Coraline, so buying it on Blu was a no-brainer.  The movie quality is what one would expect from a new movie (especially animated) on high-def.    My big disappointment came when I checked out the 3D version.  Rather than using the Real 3D technology as was in the theatre version, they used color-alternate anaglyphic 3D (like old school 3D movies).  The included glasses are the typical cardboard type.  It works well enough, but I was hoping for something a bit more advanced.  Also, rather than using the typical red/cyan anaglyphic, it's purple/green, so additional pairs of glasses will be a bit tougher to come by.    Why oh why couldn't they have stuck with the Real 3D tech for the disc?  :(
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The way JJ Abrahms handled this prequel was pure genius. By using the plot device that he did, he eliminated the problem that the original Star Trek ended up with...being confined by the conventions and conditions it had built around itself over the years. If he chooses, he can now go where no Star Trek has gone before.<br /><br />If you're a purist, you will probably have problems with this movie. If you're just a good ol' fan of the original series you'll probably love it like I did.
B001PPLJIQ|1.0|This is a terrible film, if it means to deal seriously with the holocaust and post-war Germany.  The lengthy reviews in The Times and the New York Times identify its numerous, sometimes mind-blowing inadequacies. On a significant note, who is seriously to believe that the SS had ILLITERATE WOMEN members, as Ms. Winslet's character is said to be?  And much turns on this .... but this is trivial, compared to the monstrosities noted in the (two) Times reviews.     The Pedant

B001FB55H6|4.0|Based on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel, \\"Watchmen\\" works more often than not and although director Zack Snyder's film may not be perfect, it's an extremely good adaptation of that work capturing the essence of what made the graphic novel so good.<br /><br />The \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film features 24+ minutes of additional and extended scenes. Some work such as the confrontation that Dr. Manhattan faces by reporters on a TV show while others such as the murder of an important supporting character suffers from weak dialogue and acting by the extras.<br /><br />There are some minor artifacts but on the whole the film looks stunning on Blu-ray. The special features are quite nice introducing a unique one in particularly called \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" that you quickly get the feeling will be over or misused by others. In \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" you director Snyder appears on screen during certain scenes detailing how the scene was shot. You can also access production photos/comic book pages for a comparison/contrast between how the film was storyboarded vs. the final outcome. You can also see the actual shooting of the scene while watching it again be aware however that this isn't presented in a picture-in-picture mode. It does interrupt the film but you can quickly navigate back to the film itself. There's also an alternate \\"Timeline\\" with photos comparing our world to the world of \\"Watchmen\\". It's  marvelous special feature that could only be presented in Blu-ray because of the higher bit rate/capacity of the format.<br /><br />***<br />The rest of the special features are located on disc two. We get a number of very good featurettes on the film itself from \\"The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics\\" which points out many of the innovative techniques, use of subtext and layering of the various stories that Moore & Gibbons used to present \\"Watchmen\\" back in the 80's to \\"Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes\\" which explores how the characters are mirrored in real life in our world.<br /><br />\\"Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World\\" allows you to dig into the technology of \\"Watchmen\\" ranging from Dr. Manhattan's Martian get-away to Nite Owl's ship. We also get the 11 \\"Watchmen\\" video journals which were originally on-line as well as the video for the song \\"Desolation Row\\" by My Chemical Romance. There are also BD-Live features planned for the future. You can share many of your favorite special features via BD-Live through Facebook. Some of this material is a bit repetitive because of the visual commentary track that Snyder does.<br /><br />We also get a third disc with a digital copy of the film and the code which is active for a limited time.\\"Watchmen\\" had a long and painful birth--it went through director's, writers and producers more rapidly than a kid eating a candy bar.It's the 1980's and Richard Nixon serves out his third term as President. The U.S.won the Vietnam War due to the intervention of superhero Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)and the other superheroes now banned by the government from intervening in the affairs of ordinary folks. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)is murdered the vigilante hero Rorschah (Jackie Earl Haley in a marvelous performance)as he tries to discover who is trying to eliminate America's former heroes. He contacts his old partners Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II aka Jupiter (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandis (Matthew Goode) to convince them that they need to band together to discover who wants to eliminate them.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" may be flawed but Snyder's ambitious film overcomes many of those flaws by introducing a fascinating story filled with colorful, conflicted characters. One of the flaws of the film are some of the surface, shallow performances by the actors and part of that can be laid at the feet of director Snyder and his writers on the film. While many of them can't dig in underneath the surface of these characters and expose what's truly going, others such as Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre's mother Sally Jupiter and Crudup as Dr. Manhattan reveal a significant amount of what drives their characters. Part of the issue is the film format itself which allows limited time and space to portray the same story that was told over many issues of the original comic book itself and part of that is that Snyder becomes so enamored with his visuals that he loses track of the very human element he's trying to portray. Still, flaws and all I doubt anyone else could have tackled \\"Watcmen\\" and succeeded as well as he has here. Producer Joel Silver who had the rights to produce an earlier version of the film (which would have starred Arnold) recently commented that he felt his version would be a better version of the film, more populist reaching a broader audience. What he fails to realize is that is precisely what would have watered down and ruined what was unique about \\"Watchmen\\". The fact that Snyder makes a relatively faithful, visually epic that nicely captures the flavor of the graphic novel IS an outstanding achievement worth noting regardless of the flaws.<br />Recommended.s Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre's mother Sally Jupiter and Crudup as Dr. Manhattan reveal a significant amount of what drives their characters.

0553384775|1.0|Waste Of Time And Money!    I didn't even get half way through this book.  It is the most boring and stupid book I have ever read/attempted to read.  His first day at his new company seems to read like an episode of 24, except its extremely boring and monotonous.  Pretty sure 13 hours of his life went for about 90 pages and nothing interesting happened.    He never gives any indication of how he makes his money and starts his company. One page he is starting out as a stock broker learning a few lessons, next chapter he flies home in his helicopter.      This is my first review on Amazon, I felt compelled to warn other readers not to waste their time!

0307588335|5.0|I haven't read this book - I came to AMZN to buy it after hearing the author interviewed on WNYC. Having worked for over 20 years on MBS trading floors as a research analyst, I found him extremely credible and well positioned to describe the events that overwhelmed Lehman. He was positioned in markets that would have given him ample \\"market information\\" on the mounting risks. A couple of reviewers have complained the author wasn't senior enough to be a meaningful witness, but having watched Ken Lewis (is that senior enough for you?) in front of Congress, I'm not sure I want to hear anything most of the senior Wall Street bankers could say about this crisis or the death of their companies. Is Fuld going to write a believable narrative of the collapse of Lehman Brothers? Cayne on Bear Stearns? As for senior executives ever mixing with the lowly Vice Presidents, when I was a lowly Vice President I worked miles below Jamie Dimon, who was a senior executive then and now heads - ably - JPMorgan. He could appear at any time of day on the trading floor and ask anyone about the activities or positions they were responsible for. He knew my name, he knew what I did, he asked me hard questions, he even knew when I was moving to another firm. I'm pretty sure he had a strong understanding of the risks being taken in the businesses he ran then. I suspect his \\"democratic\\" approach to information has contributed to JPMorgan's strength today. I haven't worked for them, but there are other CEOs with strong reputations for leaving the executive suite to talk to the risk takers and business managers under them. Their companies fared far better than Lehman.    Is it possible that the reviewers who dismiss the insight of \\"junior\\" people suffer from the same arrogance that doomed Lehman, AIG, etc etc etc?
0894803123|5.0|I love vanilla ice cream...boring to most, but my flavor of choice.  I also was very concerned about the raw eggs, but I took the risk (now that others have written about cooking the mixture and it turning out ok, I will try that.)  I flipped back and forth between cook books to find the differences, most just used yolks, this uses the entire egg.  Having just purchased the ice cream attachment for my Kitchenaid mixer, and still looking for the perfect vanilla ice cream, I had a sample of the product left from the book that came with the attachment, and the Ben and Jerry's vanilla to compare.  The Ben and Jerry's made a far superior product.  It was smooth and delectible...the other was darn good, but it was harder than the Ben and Jerry's and was somewhat crystalized..  After a couple of days in the freezer in a container (it is ultra rich), the Ben and Jerry's was still smooth and easy to scoop.  Now I just have to get over trying to cram a double recipie in maker...it doesn't freeze to a good consistency and you end up wasting too much.  Of the ice creams I have made now and in the past, this far surpasses any.  I'm going to try the Ben's Chocolate with peanut butter cups....yum!
0393327345|2.0|One of the very few cases in which the movie is actually better than the book. This has actually never happened to me before. I love the movie, but when I read the book I was just disappointed. I think most of the reason is because the writing is just..amatuer, for lack of a better word.     If you've already seen movie, don't read the book. It'll just bring you down.    I have read other things by Chuck Palahniuk, though, and I liked most of everything else. So please just buy different Palahniuk book.

1416914307|4.0|Shadowhunters everywhere have been called to the city of Alicante in Idris so that the Clave may decide how to best defeat Valentine. Jace doesn't want Clary to come, fearing that her unnatural talent with runes may bring her unwanted attention. But when Clary manages to get to Idris on her own, illegally, to find the only person who can heal her mother, things start to get tense. Then something horrific  happens, making it apparent that a traitor is among the Shadowhunters. Can Clary and Jace discover who it is, and how to work their strange powers before Valentine can take over?    City of Glass starts off not long after City of Ashes ends, and switches points of view frequently between main characters so quickly it's almost hard to keep up and keep everything straight. But it doesn't take long before the pacing evens out once more, and the book glides along quite nicely. Cassandra Clare manages to fit in plenty of action-packed scenes and plot twists in this lengthy final book, and does a great job at building suspense throughout. It's not until more than halfway through that readers realize exactly how well thought out the Mortal Instruments series is, and Clare keeps them guessing until the surprising end. Full of romance, betrayals, dark secrets, and plenty of adventure, Clare's final book in the Mortal Instruments trilogy is the perfect, satisfying finish that won't let go until the last page.

1416955070|4.0|Clary Fray's normal, quiet life takes a surprising turn one night when she witnesses a murder at the club Pandemonium. The only thing is, she's the only one who can see the killers and their victim. The next night, her mother disappears and her apartment is ransacked. It's then that Clary discovers that the killers she saw are really Shadowhunters, demon killers who live in secret. And the people she saw at Pandemonium, Jace, Isabelle, and Alec are the only one who can help her make sense of this strange new world of vampires, warlocks, werewolves, and demons, and help her find her mother.    Cassandra Clare's writing is illuminating and imaginative, and her talent for building imaginary worlds remarkable. City of Bones is a weighty novel, but even the most reluctant of readers will find themselves swept away by the quick wit, fast thinking, and beguiling creatures. The book moves rapidly and seamlessly as Clary and her new friends move all across the city, uncovering hints as they go along and running into all sorts of trouble. The setting details really go a long ways towards making Clary's world more believable; Clare is constantly dropping names of landmarks and streets in and around New York City, as if the reader is actually there and is familiar with the city. The ending is exhilarating, with a twist you'll never see coming that will leave you eager for more.

The thread of hope and never giving up that is woven through the trials of the maze is inspiring.  I loved the gritty determination in this story.  Faced with impossible obstacles these kids find a way to trust each other and live together in a more mature society than some I've lived in.

At the time there weren't any real car movies going about other than gone in 60 sec's (freaking awsome btw!) and that was about it. When The Fast And The Furious came out it was the first time the public got a chance to look into modern day street racing. At the time I had a Honda civic that I tricked out and use to race around in. I remember when this movie came out it meant that basicly our underground lifestyle/hobby was about to get recognized big time.<br /><br /> The Movie The Fast And The Furious is pretty much like point break only featured around the world of street racing instead of surfing. In this movie you hear car lingo instead of surfing lingo. The characters get their thrill in by racing vs. hitting big waves. The story having obviously not too original is so...so but like all action movies you watch this for the action. If your a car fan you probably can enjoy any good vehicle action seen. TF&TF only has a few racing scenes, but the story revolves around the hobby of modifying and racing cars. That's the reason that most car people can watch and appreciate the film.<br /><br /> This is a loveable movie...in the same way those old cheesy zombie movies are loveable. yeah it's corny, cheasy, inaccurate, but that's what makes it a great zombie movie. The Fast and The Furious had a cheesy plot,corny acting, inaccurate car info, but it was so great to see a movie based on racing.<br /><br /> This really isn't the movie to watch if your the type that nit picks at every minute detail that isn't on par with reality. If you look at cinema that way than no movie will ever please you unless it's a documentary. This is just a good ol' car movie.' car movie.
0061854549|4.0|Dan Ariely writes about how we humans tend to make the same mistakes over and over, especially when it comes to money. For example, once we own something, we tend to place a higher value on it. We hang on to a old vaccuum cleaner that we will never use again because it is ours, but we would not accept a similar item if someone offered it as a gift. Ariely gives better and more interesting examples of this and other human quirks.<br /><br />Predictably Irrational is fun to read, with many descriptions of simply experiments. I doubt anyone would read this book and actually dislike it. On the other hand, there is nothing original here. The idea Ariely presents are have been out there for some time, even in the popular science category.
B002HML6ZM|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans. Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable, although sometimes he seems too determinedly juvenile. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still verymuch in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. He's a brilliant anti-villain, with tragic and bittersweet dimensions to his character.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision..

B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you love your dog, if you love speed in a zen-like way, and especially if you have ever lost a close family member to cancer, you will be glued to this story. I guess my reaction to this book is very personal. We lost our only child to cancer when she was just five. Our dog would not leave her side and neither would our Main Coon. Those two animals were a steady force in her life and a tremendous source of comfort when she was gone. Sometimes when I felt overwhelmed I would go for long drives and I must admit there were times when speed did something strange--rather than being exciting, it calmed me, it made me concentrate, forcing me to feel the car as if it were alive. It took me somewhere else. The author really gets all of that.<br /><br /> Stein has the dog Enzo explain this and more. Having the book written through Enzo's point of view allowed Stein to set much of his imagination free to great effect. Through Enzo we get to laugh at his frustration of missing thumbs (dexterity), we smell tragedy coming through his senses, we feel the rage at circumstances to the point where we would like to jaw-snap at some of the characters. There is more than one way to lose a child. Enzo's grief of his master's losing custody of his child is a completely different way of exploring the raw edges of a man's sensibilities when a family is torn apart. And in many ways this is also a buddy-story, a not always perfect relationship. I loved it so much I pressed my husband, who rarely chooses novels, to read it.<br /><br />Is this the best book ever? No. Did it grab me? You betcha. Hard. That's more than enough.
B00288KNLS|5.0|I loved the visuals in this movie - takes me back to Tim Burton's The Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The storyline, while a little lacking at times, does make one realize that the grass may not always be greener on the other side. This movie is DEFINITELY not for children under the \\"tween\\" stage. All in all it was enjoyable.
1593081529|1.0|I'm an older guy with a Ph.D. in English.  For the last month or so, I've been trying to read \\"Emma,\\" and I believe I lack only 50 pages.  I'm determined to finish.  Actually, I started reading it about a year ago.  If I can suffer through 10 pages a day, I think I'm doing well.  I plan some type of celebration once I'm done.    One of my graduate students used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Jane Austen.  I agree 100%.  Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say.  Maybe not.  She simply goes on and on and on.    Personally, it's novels like \\"Emma\\" (or any other novel by the outdated Ms. Austen) that turn kids against literature.  When I was in the 10th grade, we had to read \\"Silas Marner,\\" a totally painful experience.  I reread it years later, thinking maybe I had misjudged it as a teen.  I had.  It was even more painful.    i'm really thinking about beginning a Website, \\"Real Men Don't Read Jane Austen.\\"  But that's sexist, isn't it?  I can only hear Ms. Austin responding, \\"Do you mean to say if real men don't read me, unreal men do?  What's an unreal man?  Are there both real men and unreal men in the world?  Is 'unreal' the opposite of 'real'? But what's 'real'?  Is it the opposite of 'unreal'?  Oh, my.  My my.   What's 'real'?  What's 'unreal'?  Oh my fur and whiskers!\\"
B00003CXTG|5.0|Most people who complain about this movie are worried about the historical inaccuracies and there are some, but what movie does not take liberties when dealing with history? They also complain about the love story presented. Okay it may not be the best. Every movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor has one, however. If there was no story line, you may as well be watching a war documentary. What is great about this movie is watching the attack scenes. The attack scenes last the longest of any of the Pearl Harbor movies made. The reason to see any movie about Pearl Harbor is to see the attack itself. The most impressive thing about this movie is that they made it with accurate appearing ships and aircraft. I never liked \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" because the Zero fighters did not look like Zero fighters. They used old Texan Trainer aircraft painted up like Zeros. To some people who don't know the difference I suppose it doesn't matter but to those of us that do, it's annoying. Even movies like \\"Patton\\" you never see a Sherman Tank. You see tanks from the 1960's used. \\"Battle of the Bulge\\" you see the Germans using American tanks. Why spend all that money to make a war movie and use the wrong tanks and aircraft? They do it because they know most people can't tell the difference and it saves them money.  That is why I enjoy watching movies such as \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" because the directors care about realism and accurate aircraft, ships and tanks. \\"Empire of the Sun\\" is also very accurate. This makes a great war movie for me.
0316066524|4.0|I'm maybe a third of the way through Infinite Jest. This is the first time, as a fiction reader, that I've needed two bookmarks: One for the text, and one for the footnotes. I don't mind, because reading IJ is an exercise in some new kind of body fiction, where I don't lose myself in the book, even during the best parts. I stay aware of myself. To wit: In one voluminous footnote (detailing the details of a phone conversation between two brothers), the poet Emily Dickinson's meter is mentioned. And then, as is DFW's style, maximalized, massaged, and obsessed upon. As I began to read this Dickinson tangent, I remarked silently and almost subconsciously to myself that I had visited the Dickinson homestead in Amherst a few weeks ago, and learned that many of her poems can be spoken/sung to the rhythm of \\"The Yellow Rose of Texas.\\"<br />A few paragraphs later, the text of Infinite Jest observed the same thing. Huh!<br />That said, Infinite Jest can best be described as a story about a tennis academy, the family that runs said academy, and the people who live in and around the academy. Which happens to be just west of Boston in a possibly fictional hamlet (Enfield) that would be near the unfictional Allston, Watertown, and/or Newton. If you know this area -- DFW apparently did -- and the Amherst of Dickinson and Amherst College (the latter being DFW's alma mater), then you already are in Infinite Jest.<br />DFW describes boredom and drug overdosing/withdrawal -- two very maximal experiences -- with humor and precision.<br />Glad I'm in this one.
1416585710|2.0|I am, as most SK readers are, an extremely avid fan.  As I have seen by most SK readers, \\"The Stand\\" has to be the biggest jewel in the box!  \\"Lisey's Story\\" has to be his most dullest.  I should have realized it when I bought it in the bargain section of the book store.  I have NEVER seen a Stephen King novel in the bargain section unless they have minor damage to them.  I only managed to get through 50 pages my first time reading it before I was fed up with the private language phrases.  I am now struggling to get through it simply for the sake of hoping to find where he breaks through the confusing, non-applicable stuff that doesn't really appear to belong anywhere.  For the sake of Nora Roberts review I decided to give it a go but in a number of weeks time, I am still only about 200 pages into it where normally I'm done in a couple of days.  I have to NOT recommend this book based on what I've read to date.  If I find that my opinion changes as I get further into the book (if I can force myself to choke it down) I will change my review.  But at this point, I can't see that happening.  I never thought I'd find a SK book that didn't rate at least 3 stars.  Terribly disappointing.
B000002GKT|5.0|Humble Pie was one the best concerts I ever saw.  And I'm comparing them to Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Allman Brothers and many other concerts I saw back in the old days.  I was lucky enough to find the Japanese 2007 release of this CD at Monshine Imports and it does sound fantastic!  I don't know about the sound quality on the other versions of this CD but this was and is still one of the great live albums of all times.
B00284BMBM|5.0|I wanted Chris Daughtry to win American Idol back in 2006 he deserved it more than Taylor Hicks ever did, because Chris has more talent than Taylor does. So you know I've been waiting for Leave This Town to be released for a long time, and I couldn't wait. I can't say Leave This Town is better than Daughtry, because to me they are both great albums.  I think anyone who likes Daughtry they are going to like Leave This Town. This album is almost 3 years since their debut album which is along time to keep fans waiting that long to release another album. Leave This Town has a lot of great songs, a nice listen no matter where you are, or what you're doing. Leave This Town is a must have album of 2009.<br />My favorite songs on Leave This Town are:<br />1. You Don't Belong<br />2. Open up Your Eyes<br />3. September<br />4. Life After You<br />5. Every Time You Turn Around

After reading this book it has opened my eyes to all of the brain washing that we were taught all of our lives growing up and the myths about having to eat meat to get our daily amount of protein that a human body is to consume a day. Dr. Campbell the author of the book has done a great job in showing examples in charts in the book on unhealthy food consumptions and also healthy food consumption that is recommended for a human to live healthy and happy for many years to come, and for living unhealthy for a shorter amount of time. By reading this book it will open your eyes to a healthier way of living, so that you can live a healthy life and for much longer without becoming sick with the many cancers in the world today. READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR EATING HABITS!! It is well worth it!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|300's Zack Snyder brings Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' critically acclaimed comic book Watchmen to the big screen, courtesy of DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures. Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point. The film adaptation had languished in one form of development hell or another for years after the book's release, with various directors on and off the project, including Terry Gilliam, David Hayter, and Darren Aronofsky, as well as Paul Greengrass, whose eventual dismissal stemmed from budget conflicts with the studio.
0618001905|5.0|This book is just one of many examples of how mankind is closer to the beast, in nature, then the almighty. Europeans by some chance of fate and circumstances had a technological advantage over the rest of the world for many centuries and therefore had a chance to use this advantage to define the future of mankind in a positive way, what they did instead has amounted to the road to extintion. The fact that today we live in a place where we can think that we are more than  farm animals (think usefulness) seems to be also a phenomenon of chance circumstances,  or having what will amount to a temporary illusion of self-determination. Now that the playing field is starting to level out, we will see how superior europeans will feel.  Read this book and understand a few more pieces of the bigger jigsaw puzzle. King Leopold was hardly unique in his  methods of mayhem, perhaps an awkward Johnny come lately, but definitely not unique.

B000002IGV|4.0|I'd set off on a road trip completely unprepared.  I forgot my CD case.  So, I resorted in desperation to cd's on the rack next to the cash register in truck stops.  Stay Hungry was in the bargain bin for $4.99, so I figured, 'What the heck.  I loved WNGTI when I was a kid, I'll check out the whole album.'  As is the case with most albums, the absolute best songs are the ones that didn't get airplay.  When most people think of TS, they think of the anthemic, but sophomoric 'I Wanna Rock' and 'WNGTI'.  'Don't Let Me Down' is an extraordinary song and well worth the price of the album.  The guitarists are by no means shredders, but play with depth and feeling.  Snider displays a range that puts him on par with the best vocalists.  I listened to this disk over and over across Utah and Wyoming (well, I skipped the most oft-played tracks.) and never tired of it.  Don't measure Twisted Sister only by their two most popular songs.  Their best work is their b-side stuff.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|This review is written specifically for the 2-Disc Director's Cut DVD. Further, I have not read the original graphic novel, so this review refers to only the film - there are no fan-boy blinders on over here!<br /><br />The first ten minutes of \\"Watchmen\\" suggested that I was about to see one of the lasting classics of this decade. The opening fight sequence was unlike anything in recent memory. Within the realm of superhero battles, this one ranks right up there with some of the fight scenes in The Dark Knight and 300. The scope isn't epic, in the sense that it all takes place within a high-rise apartment living room, but the choreography is fantastic. The property damage is rendered incredibly well to boot, things like fists through walls and heads through countertops - it's all here! After this, perhaps the most technically impressive credits sequence I've ever seen begins. Set to the tune of the Bob Dylan classic \\"The Times They Are a-Changin\\", the sequence displays many historical events (such as the Kennedy assassination) and indicates how superheros played roles in them. The scenes are rendered in very stylish, often slow-motion sequences. This effect is also used in the fight scenes as well. Some seem to find this grating, but I'm a major fan of this technique. Slow motion lends a battle that classic Peckinpah-esque gritty brutality, and it's used to spectacular effect in \\"Watchmen\\". Unfortunately, despite these incredible opening scenes, \\"Watchmen\\" spirals into mediocrity before finally finding a clumsy footing in the climax of the film.<br /><br />First of all, a word about the soundtrack. Often the film chooses brilliant compositions that fit the material here, such as the aforementioned Dylan track and a great use of the intro to \\"99 Luftballons\\" by Nena. Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Sounds of Silence\\" plays during a funeral sequence and the megahit Hendrix cover of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" plays near the climax and they seem to fit rather well (though the use of both is a bit hackneyed). The major failing in the film's licensed tracks is when it attempts to be ironic. For instance, the use of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" during a bizarre love sequence between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre aboard the airship \\"Archie\\". Archie, by the way, is a retro-styled throwback to the golden age of comics. It's a great setpiece, as it marries the nod to nostalgia with a fun design that cleverly mimicks the appearance of an owl. But, I digress. The love scene is already bizarre enough, and with the use of an overplayed, arguably mediocre song that's supposedly meant to indicate loss or longing - you have the makings of an epic fail. Equally as weak is the attempt to weave Nat King Cole's \\"Unforgettable\\" with the opening fight scene. When done well, this sort of technique is reasonably enjoyable, the combination of a beautiful composition with a horrific event. This, however, feels contrived and unconvincing. The score, for its part, did not detract from the film but was certainly nothing especially memorable.<br /><br />The chief plotting failure of \\"Watchmen\\" is that, for a film with a myriad of interesting characters, there is far too much time spent on Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre - who are perhaps the least interesting heroes in the bunch. Most notably, there's painstaking detail devoted to their tepid love affair, which seems to be born out of convenience rather than passion. This creates a classic superhero love triangle because it's carried on to the chagrin of the much more fascinating naked blue guy. Sorry, I mean Doctor Manhattan. He barely pays any mind to Silk Spectre, which is most humorously illustrated during a love scene where there are two or three naked blue versions of himself caressing her (yeah, it's as weird as it sounds) while the 'real' Doctor Manhattan is actually deep in his work. Curiously, he seems puzzled by her unhappiness with respect to his lack of attention. I guess his supreme intellect causes him to be beneath the primitive sentiments of a mere mortal woman. Seriously, what's with this guy? In public he wears a fine tailored suit and occasionally he'll wear a tight high-rise speedo, but he spends the bulk of the movie walking around completely naked replete with a luminous penis swinging between his legs. I guess he's so advanced even clothing has little meaning to his towering intellect.<br /><br />Rorschach is perhaps the second most-represented hero here, and is also perhaps the most interesting aside from The Comedian. He's perfected the angsty-growl speech affectations and makes a grand anti-hero. Rorschach is an engrossing, complex character because he often blurs the line between right and wrong, though he clearly considers himself a savior of humanity. His penchant for stark brutality clashes strongly with the more conventional heroic attributes of Nite Owl II. The Comedian, mostly seen in flashback, was perhaps my favorite hero presented here. Much like Rorschach, he often cannot fully decide if he's good or bad, but there is unquestionably more evil in him than good (he murders a pregnant woman carrying his own child).<br /><br />Ozymandias could've been just as complex, if not more, but far too little detail was devoted to his character. I never felt truly engaged by his motivations and his explanations only brought up more questions. I expected the \\"Director's Cut\\" to shed more light on this character, considering it adds around twenty-four minutes, but he remains as equally inscrutable as in the theatrical version. Speaking of which, I do not consider the Director's Cut the \\"definitive\\" version. The bulk of the new material isn't particularly interesting and merely adds to the running time which was already pushing three hours. The only reason I'm pleased I selected the Director's Cut is because one of my favorite scenes is included in it. In the middle of the film an elderly hero is attacked by a gang of thugs and as he's struggling with them he imagines himself punching the villians of his youth. It's a very artful, crushing scene - particularly for a character we've only seen a handful of minutes of up until that point.<br /><br />For a title that bills itself as a \\"Special Edition\\", the special features are shockingly scant, but I suppose they're saving everything for the 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition coming in December. Of course, I was wholly unaware this was in the works until I saw the flier inserted into the DVD case, which offers $10 off if you sign up to receive email spam from them. Gee, thanks WB, aren't you guys swell? As always, the almighty double-dip wins again. According to the flier, the 5-Disc edition is supposed to contain an even more extended version of the film with \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" woven in, a commentary track, the complete Watchmen comics, and over two hours of bonus content including Hollis Mason's tell-all \\"Under the Hood\\" (whatever that is). \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", I understand, has already been released as an animated feature along with the \\"Under the Hood\\" segment as a special feature. This doesn't sound like must-have material, it seems to be for hardcore fans alone.<br /><br />The special features included here are a fairly entertaining half-hour featurette on the impact of the comic and 11 \\"Watchmen Video Journals\\". These are extremely brief (3-5 minute) promotional videos that cover small aspects of the film's making. If they sound uninteresting, let me assure you that yes - they're entirely worthless. The DVD case says you can \\"immerse\\" yourself in them, but a more accurate reaction would be to \\"glance briefly\\" at them. If the clips had been edited together, I might have a slightly more positive slant on this, but ultimately this is something they slapped on the DVD simply to have something there. Honestly, I'd rather have a gallery of the trailers than these so-called \\"journals\\". To top it all off there's a bloody awful music video by My ChemicalRomance butchering the Dylan classic \\"Desolation Row\\". That is something strictly for the pre-teens, who probably shouldn't be watching this film anyway. I think I hardly need point out that this is a poor excuse for a 2-Disc \\"Special Edition\\".<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is a technical triumph in many ways, from the clever and innovative opening credit sequence to the ultra high-intensity fight scenes, but the end product is mired in a web of great ideas that never seem to be fully fleshed out. The film has a lot to say, yet cannot seem to figure out how to articulate them, aside from a few painfully obvious observations on human nature. What focused my attention on this film, prior to seeing it, was that many reviewers were commenting on the \\"complex narrative structure\\" and that it was occasionally difficult to follow. I must say, though, if \\"Watchmen\\" is what American audiences consider a \\"complex narrative\\", then I lament our intellectual downfall. There are no weighty explorations of the human psyche here and there is no complex path the characters weave, it's a by-the-numbers superhero film with an excitingly dark tint and a handful of fresh ideas. For those who have not yet seen the film, I highly suggest a rental prior to purchase.<br /><br />One final note: I must tip my hat to the filmmakers for some clever visual references to da Vinci's The Last Supper and the classic films Dr. Strangelove and Gunga Din (among other things). I greatly enjoy small flourishes such as these, as they add a lot to the atmosphere, and I'm particularly not accustomed to seeing things like this in a superhero film.of his youth. It's a very artful, crushing scene - particularly for a character we've only seen a handful of minutes of up until that point.

To top it all off there's a bloody awful music video by My Chemical Romance butchering the Dylan classic \\"Desolation Row\\". That is something strictly for the pre-teens, who probably shouldn't be watching this film anyway. I think I hardly need point out that this is a poor excuse for a 2-Disc \\"Special Edition\\".     \\"Watchmen\\" is a technical triumph in many ways, from the clever and innovative opening credit sequence to the ultra high-intensity fight scenes, but the end product is mired in a web of great ideas that never seem to be fully fleshed out. The film has a lot to say, yet cannot seem to figure out how to articulate them, aside from a few painfully obvious observations on human nature. What focused my attention on this film, prior to seeing it, was that many reviewers were commenting on the \\"complex narrative structure\\" and that it was occasionally difficult to follow. I must say, though, if \\"Watchmen\\" is what American audiences consider a \\"complex narrative\\", then I lament our intellectual downfall. There are no weighty explorations of the human psyche here and there is no complex path the characters weave, it's a by-the-numbers superhero film with an excitingly dark tint and a handful of fresh ideas. For those who have not yet seen the film, I highly suggest a rental prior to purchase.     One final note: I must tip my hat to the filmmakers for some clever visual references to da Vinci's The Last Supper and the classic films Dr. Strangelove and Gunga Din (among other things). I greatly enjoy small flourishes such as these, as they add a lot to the atmosphere, and I'm particularly not accustomed to seeing things like this in a superhero film.
B000000Y2F|3.0|Now that the Carnegie Hall performance by Monk and Trane is widely available, it's safe to knock this album off its pedestal a bit. Without denigrating any of the fine and lovely music herein, this album is really just alternative takes from the session that produced the tremendous Monk's Music album - which, if you haven't heard yet, you should drop what you are doing and go listen to forthwith. Meanwhile, Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane is padded out to full-album length with one spontaneous solo improvisation by Monk, here entitled \\"Functional\\". And that's what it is. It's as pleasant as all of Monk's solo piano musings, but rather themeless and shapeless. It's like they set the tape machine to running hoping Monk would come up with something ... but nothing really happened. That leaves just two tunes here that can't be heard elsewhere, \\"Trinkle Tinkle\\" and \\"Nutty\\", but that's a pretty slim basis for calling this a classic album, isn't it?
0739499963|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a way of masterfully creating characters that you feel you \\"know\\". Characters that could well be your neighbor or co-worker.  When the main character,Thibault, reflects on his days in war and in the service...you can truly visualize his memories while they are being described.<br /><br />With out being overly graphic or scarcely detailed Nicholas Sparks creates a perfect harmony of description and imagination.  The Lucky Onecleverly details the journey of a man on a quest. A quest to find reason to \\"his lucky charm\\".<br /><br />I found myself deeply involved with the characters. So much so that I was reading their conversation and comments aloud to completely \\"feel\\" their thoughts. A little quirk of mine, but definitely a sign of a book being wonderfully written and fully entertaining.<br /><br />At the end of the book...I found myself longing for more. What happens to these people? What's the next chapter in their lives? Where do they go from here? Was Elizabeth truly Thibault's lucky charm?<br /><br />Like any great performer should...\\"Always leave them wanting more\\" and The Lucky One definitely does.[[ASIN:0446698342 The Lucky One]]
B001TOD92C|5.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]]<br /><br />Mickey Rourke gives a well deserved Oscar Nominated performance as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. The opening credits of the film takes us through a photo/newspaper montage of the wrestler's popular career, but the actual film begins twenty years later as the wrestler struggles to maintain a life outside of his sports career with a troubled relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), trying to work discreetly for a local supermarket and a flirtatious hint of romanticism with a stripper (Marisa Tormei with some very, sensual moments at the club). The film has a very documentary look to it complete with some hand-held camera shots, but not overdone like \\"Cloverfield\\" or \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".<br /><br />The film pretty much shows Rourke's character's repeated attempts to adapt and make amends or connect to the few people he knows outside of his wrestling world, but more often than not we see his failures. He's a man that lives in a mobile home park struggling to keep up with the rent while driving around town in an old van while listening to 80's heavy metal music. He occasionally wears a hearing aid & glasses. Outside of the supermarket job he continues to participate in weekend wrestling events where we see many backstage scenes of wrestlers collaborating about pre-ordained moves. Drug use of steroids or other addictive medications are shown in the film as expected leading us to believe about the inevitable physical downfalls. A visit to the local doctor only confirms some of his fears of his detoriating, physical health.<br /><br />I think one of the most telling moments of the film is when he sits at a table during a fan fest with other wrestlers to sign autographs and to take polaroids with fans. The room is scarcely populated, and Rourke's character spends a few moments glaring at his other battered colleagues (many physically scarred & battered like himself) that are patiently waiting for any fans that scarcely arrive. We also get a moment when Rourke's character calls one of his neighborhood kids to play a vintage, Nintendo video game with him as the kid tries to describe a more modern video game called \\"Call of Duty 4\\" (the kid probably has a PS3 or Xbox 360). I also like some of his humorous moments when he worked at the deli as he tries to get the exact weight for a lady's order of potato salad who keeps telling him to add more or subtract more.<br /><br />Ultimately throughout the whole film the only time Rourke's character seems to get  acceptance is when he was near his wrestling sport community of friends and associates who always happily greets him every time they see him. Overall I didn't really think this was a film about wrestling, but just about the human element about people we may just see on television or at a sporting event by name and not knowing anything about their real life outside of their realm. It's about people consumed about what they do in the arena and failing to adapt outside of it. I was very impressed with \\"The Wrestler\\" and it was much better than I thought it was going to be. A powerful film that must be watched!rive.

0385340575|4.0|This being my first Jack Reacher novel, I was rather surprised at the\\" super character.\\"  He is just a tall normal guy who has paid alot of attention to his military training and seems to find trouble wherever he goes. And b/c of his military training can get out of most of the predicaments that he encounters.  I found this book to be like an Oreo cookie.  The cookie parts in the front and back were fantastic, while the white middle, a bit boring.  Never lacks excitement, real life descriptions and a good story.  Just have a little trouble accepting our hero.  But I will soon get another Reacher book and enjoy more of his antics. Lee child does not spare one of the blood and smells of a rotting society and one feels a real part of the calculated action. Good read.
0743298039|2.0|If you like reading books with a zillion old english  references that you will have NO CLUE of their meaning..... Then this book is for you.  What a weird depressing novel. 10 bucks and a few hours I'll NEVER see again.
B000001Y5D|4.0|What do you get if you cross blues, folk, rock, pop and funk?  Answer:  this album.  I know it sounds preposterous, but this is the most accomplished product of \\"borrowing\\" that I have ever heard.  The tracks are formed from an eclectic variety of musical elements.  For instance, \\"Train\\" sounds like Southern blues-rock (it actually reminds me of the theme song from HBO's vampire series \\"True Blood\\") with some Red Hot Chili Peppers funk thrown in.  More Chili Peppers can be heard in \\"Superfly\\", \\"No Place Like Home\\" and \\"Calling All The People\\".  \\"Pleasantly Blue\\" has a riff reminiscent of both \\"Tobacco Road\\" and Bowie's \\"Jean Genie\\", then morphs into a little Stray Cats style.  The hit, \\"What's Up\\", is to me a great neo-hippie song with vague social observations;  and there's more of that in the power ballad \\"Dear Mr. President\\".  \\"Morphine & Chocolate\\" is slow blues about addictive crutches.  \\"Spaceman\\" is like a folky, fantasy take on Velvet Underground.  In \\"Old Mr. Heffer\\", you can hear both Elvis and CCR.  \\"Drifting\\" is a really pretty but \\"shouted\\" acoustic, angsty ballad with strings.<br /><br />So, what ties all this together?  Singer-songwriter Linda Perry, of course.  Her voice is strong and exuberant, and her persona radiates confidence, good will and sly, intelligent humor, making this album a more than adequate artistic statement.  Too bad it was the only one the band made.
B0009MAP90|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what version of this cd I have...perhaps not the remastered version...my cd would have been cheap. In any case, I have found that there is not a lot of discernable difference with remastered versions of Dylan's accoustic cds, in some cases. Guessing that that would be the case here too. I did find that the sound in this cd was of the faux stereo kind...i.e. you'd get vocals in one speaker and the guitar in another speaker, which isn't ideal, but is to be expected for releases produced around this time.       Anyway, in his debut album, Dylan pretty much covers traditional folk songs. For a man who would gain a stellar reputation for songwriting, it's a pity that in some cases he didn't change a word here or there, to agree with his gender, so that he makes the song absurd.    Anyway, I think that the best tracks on this cd are:    Talkin' New York - an original composition which seems autobiographical. Vocals and harmonica in the left speaker and the guitar on the right, which is how the first song was arranged. Good harmonica in this song.    In my time of dyin' - features a steel string accoustic guitar, I think, with a twangy intro to the song. It's a bluesy, negro-spiritual type of song. Not sure, but I think that my notes say that Dylan sounds like a black singer or something.    House of the risin' sun - I watched a documentary a while back which informs my comments on this song...I'm using the entry for this album on Wikipedia to source my information - in the documentary \\"No direction home\\", fellow folk artist Dave Van Ronk claims that Dylan used his arrangement of this song and recorded it before he had a chance to. To me, this speaks ill of Dylan, although I can understand his motivation...he was a nobody, and would step on a peers head to get ahead. In any case, this is a nice song, but unintentionally funny as Dylan neglects to change the gender terms in this song, like I mentioned previously, meaning that Dylan is singing abouta hard life, with himself as a girl! In any case, it's a pity Dylan stooped this low for this song...I feel sorry for Van Ronk.    That's pretty much the best of this album, in my view. For some of the rest:    You're no good - has some humour and unintelligible lyrics as well.     Man of constant sorrow - having heard a different version of \\"Man of constant sorrow\\" in the movie \\"Oh brother, where art thou?\\", I think, Dylan might have been smarter raiding someone else's arrangement for this song. It does have good harmonica playing though, but he does hit a bung note on his guitar!    Fixin' to die - mentions Jesus multiple times in this song. The Bob really lets rip, vocally, on this song. I don't think he has ever sounded so wild.    Pretty Peggy-0 -Features the vocal \\"hoo\\" which will appear in his later albums.     Highway 51 - sounds like he uses the riff from The Everly Brother's song \\"Wake up little Suzie\\".    Gospel plow - more Jesus talk. Has frenetic harmonica playing.    Baby, let me follow you down - has a chatty intro and some nice harmonica playing.    Freight train blues - The Bob near yodels in this song and he must sing the longest note ever!    Song to Woody - an ode to his musical influence.    See that my grave is kept clean - The Bob varies his guitar playing techniques in this song.    I can't say that I am a huge fan of Dylan or consider him to have written lots of classic albums or songs, but I like this album for its listenability.     My favourite Dylan album is \\"The freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". His bleak \\"The times they are a changin'\\" is also a good listen.    Both the above two albums offer a different mood for the man. In a similar vein, I'd recommend his \\"Blood on the tracks\\" album for offering up something different again...in this case, easy listening music. \\"Blonde on blonde\\" is also a good album.    For a left-field suggestion, Aussie protest pop-rockers Midnight Oil did a rootsy kind of album in \\"Place without a postcard\\" which they had never done the likes of before or after. It's a more European kind of folk influence, I think. Not a favourite album of mine, but I like some of the songs, and fans of folk might like it more than I did. My favourite Midnight Oil albums are their more traditional pop/rock albums in \\"Diesel and dust\\" and \\"10,....,1\\". They have a very good arty pop/rock protest album in \\"Red sails in the sunset\\". Definitely worth exploring for fans of protest music.
031606792X|3.0|I got introduced to this series by a friend of mine that teaches high school.  All of her students were into it.  I teach elementary school and I also have 2 teenagers, a daughter and a son.  I think I related to this story more from a parent's point of view.  I really liked the first 3 books, although I did see the criticisms that others saw and articulated.  There were some abusive tendencies, Edward was controlling and Bella did wrap her whole life around a man.... still, I liked it til the last book.  I was sooooooo disappointed!  In fact, I have never written a review or even read reviews much.  Generally, If I disliked a book, I sat it down and that was that. For some reason , this time, it bothered me.  I was really looking forward to Bella maturing and growing up some and that didn't happen.  I felt like she solved all of her problems by becoming a \\"Cullen\\". I had questions like...  1. Why did Edward have to \\"buy\\" her way into Darmouth?  Hadn't she been in advanced classes? Wasn't she smart enough to get accepted into a good school? Couldn't she have gotten a scholarship to pay her tuition? Perhaps this would have been a good time for Bella to introduce Edward to a great concept known as \\"earning your way\\" rather than getting everything you want by being gorgeous, rich and manipulative.  2. If she were so clumsy and accident prone, how did she get through life all those years w/o Edward running interference?  One would think this girl was not capable of going to Walmart by herself.   3. Wasn't Bella capable of picking out a prom dress, wedding dress, honeymoon attire etc. without Alice having to do it for her?    4. Why did they always consult with Edward's family about major decisions, but not with Bella's?  Weren't her parents intelligent and caring too?  She never gave Charlie a chance.  In fact, I think the best advice that she got in the whole series came from her father. He told her after Edward came back that she should have a balance in her life andnot allow him to become her whole life again.  She did not take his advice, but it was very, very good advice.  Wouldn't her parents care enough about her that she could tell them about her future plans?  Afterall, if Edward could trust Bella with his secrets, couldn't they trust her parents too?    5. Didn't Bella have any talents before she became a vampire?  I mean, Edward was a gifted musician, he could dance like Fred Astaire, he spoke Spanish fluently, He was at the top of his class, He was the fastest runner in his family and had self-control like only Carlisle.  In fact, he helped Carlisle in his practice.  He delivered Bella's baby and came up with the idea of injecting his venom into her heart versus biting her.  Couldn't Bella sing well, dance well, write well, was she good in photography???? Something!!!!  That part of her character was not developed until she became a vampire.   6. And lastly, wasn't Bella already beautiful before she became a vampire? Wasn't that what attracted Edward to her in the first place? He had been around beautiful vampire women for decades, but didn't find them attractive.  He was attracted to Bella because she was smart, caring , funny, insightful etc. etc.      I don't want to be overly critical because I realize that it's just a book.  It's not supposed to define the next generation.  It was written to entertain.. and it did that.  I was just disappointed in the ending. I didn't like the way she changed the characters.   I wanted Bella to find the beauty in herself and see that she was wonderful just the way she was and Edward was equally as lucky to have her in his life.  Instead, I felt that her problems were solved by making her a cullen- complete with designer outfits and Ferraris.      I also thought she made total wusses out of the men in the story.  Jacob was smart, funny, handsome and good with his hands.  Bella's a great gal, but she's not the only fish in the sea.  Surely there are other girls in their area that would appreciate a great catch like Jacob.  I hated watching him turn into this big desperate wuss!  ... and that imprinting stuff--creepy!  I was so tired of Edward in agony and moaning-- get a backbone Edward!!!  and lastly Charlie- who was sensible, and responsible and who has dealt with crime and behavior as a police officer for years... \\"Don't tell me anymore than I need to know\\"-- What?????     Last comment, that baby stuff was ridiculous and way over the top!!!  Couldn't Bella have just had a difficult pregnancy and perhaps had to stay on bed-rest??  Did we really need all that blood and gore?        Thanks for allowing me to vent!!!
B00008WT5C|4.0|This album lacks the kind of killer, stadium anthems that the band is known for, but they come up with numerous live favourites on this album. Whilst not as raw as Powerage, their guitar sound does come close to that album...it's got an electric, buzzing guitar sound, but just not as jangling or grinding as Powerage's sound. If you want rawness, go for Powerage, but for something with hooks, Let There Be Rock is more accessible. It's foot stomping, raw guitar rock.    Best song:    Dog eat dog - has a catchy chorus and riff. Part of the song has got some interesting lead guitar sounds.    Let there be rock - check out the official video to this song...the lyrics are matched with the appropriate visuals...Pastor Bon Scott, on his pulpit, giving a sermon on the Genesis of rock! Bassy track.    Problem child - I like the riff in this. As the character in this song, Bon is quite a nasty piece of work...you wouldn't want to tangle with him in a pub. This is a superior pub rock song in the Australian style. It has some fast fretwork on the guitar, and the song does have some bass, which you don't really notice with this band. Not sure who plays the maracas in this song...Bon?!    The rest:    Go down - bar rocker boogie. It's an ode to fellatio. Think this may be the first instance of this band celebrating that particular sexual act (they do so later in their classic \\"Back in black\\" album, in the song \\"Givin' the dog a bone\\").    Bad boy boogie - the lyrics reminded me of Iron Maiden for some reason: \\"It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son\\". Don't know why...    Overdose - Laid back intro; solid pub rock. Nice riff and and lead guitar.    Hell ain't a bad place to be - features the lyric \\"Telling me no lies\\", which later features in their classic \\"Back in black\\" album for the song \\"You shook me all night long\\".    Whole lotta Rosie - a live staple. On live videos you can often see an enormous, obese, inflatable woman. Bon sings about a sexual conquest of hisin this song...the title character. If I heard him right, her measurements were 42, 39, 56 and she weighed in at 19 stone. Hmmm, he liked his women big, did our Bon!    Recommendations:        If this album is too hooky for you, try Powerage. If it's not hooky enough, try their classics like \\"Back in black\\", \\"T.N.T\\" and \\"Dirty deeds done dirt cheap\\" (the Australian versions for the latter titles, as they have different, and sometimes superior track listings. E.g. the original Australian version of Dirty Deeds had the classic track \\"Jail break\\", which, unfortunately, doesn't seem to get made anymore...the inferior US release gets made now, and is sold to even Australia. Bit of a bummer.        If you like pub rock type music, some good Australian examples would be hard rockers like Rose Tattoo and The Angels. My favourite songs of theirs are: \\"We can't be beaten\\" for the Tatts, and \\"Shadow boxer\\" for The Angels.
0743298039|1.0|I tried harder than I ever have to hang in with a bad book, and did so because of glowing reviews. What were they thinking? I would say that reading this was like watching grass grow, except that watching grass can be pleasant. If Setterfield had sliced out about 12 of the 14 hours, it might have been an okay novel. Maybe.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved it.  Funny, romantic, and fast-paced.  Great characters--Jace, Simon, Magnus Bane.  Kept me up late into the night reading.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|It was amazingly disgusting watching a band that i've grown up on idolizing as quintessential males turn into women off a common soap opera.  Metallica's earlier work will always be some of the greatest metal there is...and i will always stand by that!  \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" is a complete waste of time! It resembled \\"The Bold & the Beautiful\\". Half & hour down, I thought it was just Metallica with the Oprah-esk issues, only to find Dave Mustaine (to my horror) following suit... STRIKE 2   I come from an older school of metal, and this documentary contradicts everything metal was (or what I believed it to be!) in the 80's and 90's. It had but one plus point once it was over and done with...I felt compelled to listen to Master of Puppets beginning to end.   Barring this review, I've never looked back since!
B000W74EQC|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch for the first time in theaters and has been fun every time I have watched it since. The introduction of the wizarding world in conjunction with the \\"normal\\" world was well done. The characters, their interaction and development, and the great world of majic we've all dreamed of as kids has been brilliantly brought to life in this movie.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Wow, i stumbled across Halestorm looking for...of all things Rush!  And DAMM!!!  I listen to a track or two....and was floored.  Busted out the Zune and downloaded it.  Wow!  What a breath of fresh fvcking rock from a chic lead...and the band backing her...WTF!?  They rip!  Nice progressive licks here and there.  Cant wait for a tour to Houston!  Kick butt!  buying tonight!  Good luck guys!    Herf
B000W746GK|4.0|A fun sequel to the first, this one continues to show the main characters and their growth in magic and friendship. The flashbacks, mysteries, and twists in the story make for a fun movie (especially for the first time and considering you've not read the books). I enjoyed the involvement of magical creatures, the introduction of new characters, and the fact the same actors/actresses are still here (nothing worse than someone else trying to pull off a character when you've already identified that character to someone else).
0439023483|5.0|This book captured my imagination and I thoroughly enjoyed every page. Considering the theme is the tension between death and survival--I never really found it over-the-top gory. I would compare it to a PG13 movie that has some violent scenes. All in all I would recommend this book for mature young adult readers over the age of 13 or 14.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The third of the Harry Potter movies, this is probably my favorite. The atmosphere of this movie is darker than the previous two and it is great to see the same actors/actresses back to play the characters we know. Harry's Aunt blowing up and floating away and the ride on the Knight Bus adds a little silliness to the film. Harry is starting to rebel a little which makes him identifiable to our own behaviors as kids when we rebelled or got upset or lost our temper. This helps add to Harry's character and make him seem, for all the magic in the world, seem so \\"normal\\" to us. The story seems to have passed character development for the most part and focused more on where the story is going, what has happened before (the parents and friends of our heros/heroinne now), and does a great job of using \\"time\\". We learn more about the dark past with Lord Voldemort, meet new characters (Prof. Lupin and Sirius), and established characters such as Haggrid and Draco seem to really come of age for lack of a better term.
6302886228|5.0|Where is the DVD of this concert?  With all the crap on DVD we still have to watch this on VHS?
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. By now there is no telling how many times I've seen it and to think I missed taking advantage of seeing it sooner! I like how things are directed and presented with flashbacks here and there. I don't know what really to say about this movie other than it is trully one of the best movies ever made.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|Van Morrison's voice has matured over time, and while it was never pretty, his voice has become fuller.  This compilation takes early material as it was, and it is a little surprizing to hear his voice as it was.  Some of the early tunes are almost unfamiliar as his songs.    Morrison's bands were never just guitar, bass and drum.  He relies more on keyboards and brass.  In much of his music, his voice is almost a part of the rhythm section.      His musical career spans four decades, and he has been great throughout it. His songs are classics.  If you like Van Morrison, this is a great collection.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|1.) \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" will come to Blu-Ray eventually. At the Comic Con panel yesterday, producers said a Blu-Ray set won't be released until after prices drop (they mentioned this will happen around winter/Christmastime). You can check the official Terry Goodkind board for more specific details. So for those of you who plan on rating this show negatively solely because of this, don't bother.    2.) The show and the books are not the same. Some of the changes have been for the worse; I was disappointed that Kahlan went from the daughter of a queen to an orphan with a rough life. The Box of Orden storyline could have been handled with more care as well. On the other hand, the writers seemed to have done away with the Star Wars-esque reveal at the end of Book 1. A wise move on their part as the show would have felt too much like a medieval version of the Star Wars saga.    3.) The production values have been consistently impressive. The cinematography and art direction are some of the best I've seen on TV to date. At times it almost feels like I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show.    4.) I love the cast. Bridget Regan (Kahlan) is the most gifted performer, managing to credibly portray Kahlan as a strong warrior capable of warmth and kindness. And although she currently has appeared in only two episodes, Jessica Marais (Denna) is the show's greatest villain. She can accomplish so much with just a quick look and low voice.    So if you're looking for a fun genre series with good characters and sharp special effects, you should try \\"Legend of the Seeker\\". The first few episodes can be tedious, but by Episode 7 everyone steps up to the plate and manages to create one of the most entertaining fantasy series in recent years.
0143038419|1.0|I had to come and write a comment here. This book has a \\"bad vibe\\" and got me quite depressed after reading it! I do not criticize the author's self-involvement because as a single woman in my 30s/40s I may see life in a very self-involved way. So that, I cannot criticize.<br /><br />But the truth is that while there in the book some interesting insights on how we hate ourselves and how we should be more patient and loving to ourselves, the whole book left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth (and I was feeling quite depressed) as if my energy level plummeted down after finishing to read it! I was so disgusted with the energy created that I even threw the book to the TRASH (I have NEVER done that [..] There is something weird happening here [..]<br /><br />WHAT OTHER BOOK have you seen that 1400 people would try to get rid off for [..]That tells you something!<br /><br />Although the story seemingly \\"ends well\\" (she finds love, as the title indicates) the vibrational frequency that this book has is \\"icky\\" (sorry, ms. author).<br /><br />I followed other posters' information and I looked up her guru and it is true that there are terrible sex-abuse accusations. There is even a website for people who used to devote their lives to siddhi yoga and now have abandoned it. One psychoanalyst that was one of them talks about this being a cult and how abuse can take many forms.<br /><br />I even researched the author and looked at some youtube videos to see what she was really about and I have to say I didn't dislike her personally, nor she claims to be laying any path to nowhere that should be followed, not at all. She spoke of herself, this is \\"her\\" trip (inner and outer) and she wrote a book about that, it was never intended to be a \\"self-help\\" book. It is interesting to see in the internet how she was big with Ophrah and then completely dissapeared from the map. Maybe there is something ringing 'not true\\" in this thing.<br /><br />Again, I don't want to \\"soil\\" her or her book. I do not criticize her for talking in a self-absorbed matter, I do not think that is a problem someone - like me- can even enjoy it and have no business criticizing that aspect of the writing, but I DID feel I wanted to come to the reviews to warn other readers that- like me- may look for an entertaining easy-to-read book, I want to warn them NOT to get into this book because it may leave you more depleted than when you just started, is not a \\"fleeing\\" distraction if it leaves you DEPRESSED!self-absorbed matter, I do not think that is a problem someone - like me- can even enjoy it and have no business criticizing that aspect of the writing, but I DID feel I wanted to come to the reviews to warn other readers that- like me- may look for an entertaining easy-to-read book, I want to warn them NOT to get into this book because it may leave you more depleted than when you just started, is not a \\"fleeing\\" distraction if it leaves you DEPRESSED!
B00013F38K|2.0|I enjoyed this show when it first aired and was looking forward to buying it. I read one of the reviews which criticized the show for categorizing all whites as evil. I have to say that after watching it I find that true. It is almost comical how the white characters are portrayed as ignorant, barbaric racist. People of color and Asians are almost always portrayed as smart, sensitive, and loving victims of some evil, perpetrated by those evil whites. I guess they went out of their way to reverse discrimination. It seems over the top but consider the times.    I think most people wish the lead went to Bruce Lee who was supposed to get it. Little did they know who would become the superstar.    Enjoy it for what it is, a fun piece of nostalgia.
B001NZZEEI|5.0|I never thought I'd be someone to have a VERY FAVOURITE ALBUM but for some reason, this is the one I could listen to anytime, any mood... it's just always perfect to me:)
B000QQH4YS|1.0|First, let me say that Robocop is anything but original. It is a complete rip off of the Japanese cartoon of the early 1960's called 8th man. Many of these episodes were translated to English and aired on US television. It is so similar I have to wonder if there was a lawsuit.     Police reporter Peter Brady is run down by mobster and a scientist takes his dying body and transfers his mind into the invincible robot body of 8th Man. He than dedicates his life to catching criminals. 8th Man was infinitely better and I highly recommend it to anyone.    I know there some cool elements about this movie but. it is still a good idea in a bad movie. I think people are so enamored by the story and special effects that they don't look more critically at the movie itself. It was a horrible movie. It was ugly, violent and depressing in general. The city's denizens also seemed dark and not worth saving. It reminds me of how Gotham City is portrayed in  the Batman movies. They portray it in a way that you feel who would want to save it. You feel they should just level the city and start over. It could have been much better.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|The Wretched Spawn was one of my first Cannibal Corpse albums, and to this day it remains the best of my collection. Flawless production, brutal mix of hooky songs as well as brutal songs. This album takes you through many twists and turns, beginning with the trashy Severed Head Stoning, and ending with the 16 second scream from Fisher on They Deserve to Die. A more thorough breakdown:    Severed Head Stoning - One of THE best Cannibal openers. Amazing riffs and drums as fast as lightning. What you'd expect as a Corpse opener. 4 Stars.    Psychotic Precision - Very technical song. At one point I thought my player skipped, because there is a repeated section where they completely go off course, and after repeated listens, it gets EXTREMELY addictive. Great technical song with many pinch harmonics to bang your head to. 5 Stars.    Decency Defied - Good song upon first listen. Very, very catchy song, though after repeated listens it normally requires a skip, because it follows the setup of a basic radio friendly song. 3 Stars.    Frantic Disembowelment - Wow. If there is one song that completely is worth buying the ENTIRE album for, its definitely this song. Amazingly technical, extremely hard to play. Just watch the extra DVD to see what I mean. They play Frantic without any vocals and with Pat as the only guitarist. You'll appreciate this song that much more after you realize its difficulty. Oh, and yes, it comes with a bonus DVD that shows the making of the album, plus some bonus features, but I digress. Brutal song, speedy riffs, grows on you. 5 Stars.    The Wretched Spawn - Used to be my favorite off the album, but for now, its just decent. This has one of the most amazing breakdowns in the history of the Corpse. I love the extreme head banging section where Fisher screams, IT WAS MADE TO KILL!!!. 5 Stars.    Cyanide Assassin - Typical, but still brutal Corpse. Very fast song with many twists and turns to keep you interested, not much else to say. 5 Stars.    Festering in the Crypt - It seems there is a nice little slow song on each Cannibal album lately, always written by Owen. They always kick arse, and this is no exception. I think this is one of the best songs Owen has written since Pat joined the band. 5 Stars.    Nothing Left to Mutilate - Strange song. It gets your head thrashing, but it seems like George is the focus here, as the guitars fade into the mix. Eh, it doesn't deserve a skip, but it isn't a standout track. 4 Stars.    Blunt Force Castration - I love the lyrics to this song, but the music is only basic. Another typical Corpse song. 4 Stars.    Rotted Body Landslide - I love the section near the beginning of this song. And boy, do I LOVE this song title! Decent song. 4 Stars.    Slain - Not for the average Corpse fan, this song may let some of you down. Strange song, in all honesty, but I think that makes it a gem. Not extremely well done, but rare for Corpse, so i'll give it 4 Stars just for trying something new.    Bent Backwards and Broken - Another amazing song title, with amazing lyrics. This song is quite technical, and it will definitely melt faces. 5 Stars.    They Deserve to Die - Amazing song. Very heavy, very catchy. Has a nice 16 second scream by the one and only George Fisher near the end. Very pleasing, and slightly unexpected as an album closer.    This album holds a very special place in my Corpse, hell, even music collection, and I recommend it to every Corpse fan. Those of you who never have tried Death Metal, listen with an open mind, please. And those of you who refuse to listen with an open mind, but buy the album anyway, please don't come onto Amazon and bash this album like so many others have done.
B002C2XXJY|5.0|This is a big step up from her last album the songs are much better and the lyrics are more mature. this cd is great for younger and older fans. my favorite song is here we go again that song alone is worth the price of the whole cd.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Just watched this Director's Cut last night. Have to say this is Snyder's vision fully realized. Running almost 3 hours, this is the version to own, you get more dialogue, extended scenes, more depth to the characters and feels more in touch with the graphic novel. Where the theatrical release, as it was good I felt it seemed short, it needed something more, and Thank God for Blu Ray. We all know the graphic novel has so much and one can only cram so much into the movie, I believe Snyder and Co. did just that, found that right balance to honor the graphic novel and stay close to the source material. This is a very well adapted graphic novel for the screen. And I don't care what everyone says but Snyder and Tyler Bates sure know how to come up with a great soundtrack, other music mastermind for soundtracks is Tarantino! Anyways this and Sin City so far are the best adaptations in my humble opinion. On to the Blu Ray, picture was outstanding!! You can see each individual particles when Dr. Manhattan zaps people to another spot. The sound was wonderful. I was very pleased with this, the picture was just so sharp and clear. This is a flawless Blu Ray. Have to say there are some movies that is a must have in a collector's DVD collection to fully appreciate that beautiful Hi-Def quality. This is one, Dark Knight, Serenity, Transformers, Iron Man, and 300 are the others in my most humble opinion should be in one's collection!<br />[...]
1400063736|4.0|This is one of those books that you finish the last page and just sit and hold it to let it sink in.  The word that keeps coming to mind as I reflect back on the novel is \\"raw\\".  Set in New York in 1974 the book delves into the lives of people living in the city at that time -- hookers, wealthy citizens living on Park Avenue, Irish immigrants, etc.  Each of their stories is shared in alternating chapters with connections between all of them.  The stories are as diverse as the people themselves, but they are masterfully told by this author in such a way that all totally come alive in the reader's eye.  The tight rope walker, Philippe Petit, opens the narrative and begins the series of chapters, but the focus quickly shifts to other characters and their lives.<br /><br />While I didn't absolutly love this story, the writing alone makes the novel worth a read.  With so many poorly written books out there, this type of eloquence is appreciated greatly by this reader.
B000068FUS|5.0|I've been listening to Neil Young since the 1960s & Skynyrd since the 1970s, but I learned so much about their relationship from this CD. And a whole lot about the South, and George Wallace, and the Muscle Shoals music scene, and well, I could go on and on. And I lived through a lot of it.    There are so many great songs on this CD, songs that really stick with you. And the last song, describing Ronnie's feelings on the plane as he realizes it's going to crash, my God, it's one of the most profound works of art I've ever heard.    If you like Lynyrd Skynyrd, if you like Neil Young, if you like Southern Rock, if you like rock at all, and you don't know about this CD, buy this immediately.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|\\"Watchmen\\" when it debuted in mid '80s was a groundbreaking event in the world of comics.  Along with Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" it began to change the fundamental perceptions of comics -- that they were strictly kid stuff.  \\"Watchmen\\" helped establish that the comic book medium could be used to tell serious, thoughtful, adult-themed stories, that discriminating readers could enjoy and appreciate.  Now that Hollywood has discovered comic books as a source of movie ideas, and each comic book adaptation comes practically tripping on the heels of its predecessor, I suppose it was only a matter of time before \\"Watchmen\\" was translated to the silver screen.  It was worth the wait in this case.<br /><br />Most people familiar with comics will be familiar with Alan Moore's very public comments repudiating this movie, sight unseen, even to the point of denigrating its director.  Alan Moore needs to get over himself.  I understand he has good cause to feel disappointed with Hollywood, given the awfulness of some previous adaptations of his work.  But he has overreacted, like a kid who wants to take his ball and go home now.  He has declared \\"Watchmen\\" to be \\"unfilmable,\\" which is interesting, since he clearly didn't always feel that way.  He was reportedly \\"enthusiastic\\" back in the '80s when he first sold the film rights to \\"Watchmen.\\"  If it wasn't unfilmable then, why would it be now?  Moore seems to have lost the ability to tell the difference between a bad storytelling medium, and a good storytelling medium badly employed, and now his disappointment has fermented into petulance.  It's really a shame, because a movie adaptation of his work has finally done it justice.  It's far from perfect, and no doubt even if this exact movie could have been made back when he still had enthusiasm for the project, he'd disagree with some of the director's decisions.  But as it is, he's ironically decided to turn his back on films only when at last someone's done a film adaptation of his work that he might actually have liked.  Pity.  It's his loss.<br /><br />This really is a good film.  It's about as faithful to the graphic novel as a film could possibly be, given the changes that have to be made to adapt it into a movie, and keep the movie to a reasonable run time that audiences will be able to sit through.  The cast is nearly perfect.  All of the actors turn in solid performances, and Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really stand out in their roles.  Their performances are two of the reasons this is such a good adaptation.  The audience ends up perceiving the characters in precisely the same way they came across in the graphic novel.  In the comedian's case, we see an amoral, sometimes vicious man, and yet strangely, while never approving of him, don't quite hate him the way we ought to hate someone who has done the things he has.  In Rorschach, who seems to be the most popular character in both the graphic novel and the movie, we see a character who maintains a very black/white view of the world and the moral choices it presents us, and who is totally uncompromising and true to his beliefs, even to the point of being willing to die for them rather than compromising.  Perhaps this level of integrity and moral courage, as well as pure, unflinching toughness, is what causes people to like a character who is anti-social and violent, and more than a little crazy.  The other characters are almost as well done, but those two really stand out.  Once again, despite the changes made to bring this story to film, Moore really ought to get off his high horse and enjoy the movie for what it is, which is, on the whole, a faithful, respectful adaptation, which keeps the story and its themes fully intact, even if some of the details have to be changed for the medium.<br /><br />Not everything is translated faithfully from the source material, however.  The ending is significantly altered, but this is not a change which seems to hurt thefilm at all.  In fact a considerable body of opinion exists that it actually improved the story.<br /><br />But nothing is perfect, and the \\"Watchmen\\" movie is no exception.  Other changes, though more minor, are not so beneficial.  One example of this is the extreme, brutally graphic violence of some of the scenes.  Dan and Laurie's fight with the gang of muggers in the alley is a lot bloodier than in the book.  And in the director's cut, the assassination attempt on Veidt in his office is a LOT more brutal.  In the novel, we see a gunman step into view, fire at Veidt, and hit his secretary with one shot, and she falls over dead.  In the director's cut of the movie, she gets his twice twice, in super slo mo, with close ups on the impacts, one of which takes off several fingers of her right hand.  Then another bullet hits Lee Iacocca right between the eyes (and he wasn't even in the book).  And for the life of me, I can't see any way in which all this extra carnage improves the story one jot.  It adds nothing whatsoever to the story.  And speaking of the scene with Iacocca, the insertion of him into this movie, in a scene where he and several other corporate CEOs confront Veidt is by far the worst scene in the movie.  It's such a hamfisted, childish caricature of the evil rich capitalist fat cat, right down to one of the sinister plutocrats sneering \\"Free energy?  Free's just another word for for socialist.  We may just have to look into some of your past associations.\\"  It comes across as just what it is, a Hollywood liberal's fantasy of what a rich conservative corporate executive is.  And again, it adds nothing to the story.  More minor flaws include Snyder's trademark overuse of slow motion, and Silk Spectre's magic boots, which are stiletto-heeled in any scene where she's just walking or standing, but flat-heeled when she fights bad guys.<br /><br />Still the flaws are fairly minor.  And I suppose they -- the consequence of having Zack Snyder as director -- are the price we must pay for the good fortune of having Zack Snyder as a director.  It was probably inevitable that he would insert such things into the movie, but he was also one of the only directors who appreciated the the original story enough to keep the changes minor, and stay as faithful to the novel as he did.  The result is a great movie, which can be enjoyed even by people who never read the graphic novel, but which will also please the novels longtime and devoted fans.considerable body of opinion exists that it actually improved the story.

0307341569|4.0|I didn't think I was going to enjoy my time with Dark Places when I first began reading it.  The first couple sentences were descriptive, but didn't sit well with me: \\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ.  Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.  It's the Day blood.\\"  After reading this opening, I raised my eyebrows and thought...this is a tad silly, pompous and over-the-top.      Things didn't progress well when author Gillian Flynn introduced me to Libby Day, the protagonist which professed to the previous \\"meanness.\\"  Here's a character who'se lazy, incompetent, annoying and so utterly frustrating as a person that I didn't think I would be able to stand reading about her.  You could say that she had reason to be as she was: almost her entire family was murdered and she fingered her brother Ben as the heinous culprit when she was seven.  Ben went to jail and Libby lived for the next twenty-five years off of her infamy as the only survivor of \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\"      When her money runs low as people start to move on (after all, in our short term memoried culture where the latest over-the-top crime shadows whatever came before), Libby is introduced to the aptly named, if also silly, Kill Club that investigates murders.  Of course, they believe that Libby named the wrong person and her brother was wrongly convicted.  Sensing a pay day in this club, Libby agrees to start speaking to people and perform her own investigation.    Dark Places takes an interesting approach to solving the murder.  It's set in two distinct periods of time, today and the night before and the day of the fateful crime.  Each chapter is told in first person, from a particular person's perspective (not always Libby).  Together, each chapter fully investigates what really happened that night and how miscommunication, sensationalism and lack of information can misrepresent what happens.  I found this portion of the novel to be truly intriguing and Flynn does a terrific job of telling the story in different voices as it encapsulates fully what happened.      Kudos also to Flynn who created a very selfish and annoying character in Libby and then spent the next few hundred pages actually making me interested in her plight.  I found the journey through the past and unsavory characters (which there are more of than good people) to be incredibly interesting.  The pages flew by as if I was reading a thriller when, in fact, I found myself reading a drama that centered around a murder.  Unfortunately, the ending fell flat with me.  Once the truth is presented, I found this semi-realistic story take a bizarrely story approach.  All of a sudden, it felt like I was reading a novel--fiction--and not Libby's story.  It all gets wrapped up with a pat answer that didn't ring true.      In the end, I found Dark Places to be more about the journey and about how kids can easily screw up people's lives based on what they saw versus what they think they saw, than solving the actual crime.  Surprisingly enjoyable.  3.5 stars.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Being a fan of michael jackson for all his career as i am 51 and saw him when i was 16 in rhode island (thrill of my teenage life); i didnt expect anything less of him than amazing.  let alone his performance it was surreal to see that amount of people, literally a sea of people watching him without blinking.  dancing, singing (which was live)was Michael all the way.  i am still grieving and he still plays on in my car, my office, my heart.      he gives his backups the stage, acknowledges his brothers at one point and one girl had her day when he took her on stage to dance and hug her...i wonder what she is doing today 17 years later?    enjoy enjoy enjoy!  and definitely buy - if not for yourself for your kids to have....he is a legend and there truly will be no one else like him.  bigger than the beatles...
0679720200|5.0|My dad likes Albert Camus and my mom doesn't. I'm going to side with my dad on this one.    One can debate the merits and demerits of the philosophy of the \\"absurd\\", and how well this books expostulates it. I think this book is great way to look at life because it creates the idea of an unexplainable phenomenon/na and illustrates it at a level that is easy to understand.     Humans being rational often, if not always, look for explanations within dimensions and perspectives they can understand. In the course of living this is often possible, and sometimes not. I think this books takes this idea and illustrates eloquently and pithily, which is why I like it.
0307588335|2.0|The author of the book was not at the senior level of Lehman nor was he even with Lehman when it ultimately went bankrupt.  Therefore, his accounts of what happens at the senior level of Lehman and at the end are hearsay.  The writing style of the book is very punch, where all the good people are great and brilliant and geniuses and all the bad guys are blockheads.  I really got tired of reading how all of the author's friends were brilliant.  Some of the things stated in the book are incorrect, misleading or over simplified.  There are some highlights that are very interesting; however, for example the discussion about whom inside Lehman saw the end coming and the failure at the top to listen.  Ultimately, however, if you are looking at a book that clearly and correctly documents the decline of Lehman (ever an insider's account) this book is not it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never seen or heard of this show until the movie came out.  I didn't see that either.  Someone lent me the dvd's and I can't get over how much I love this show.  I'm about 1/2 way through the box set and I'm sad that it won't go longer than that.  This is an amazing show.  It's like Star Trek meets the wild wild west.  If you like the sound of that, you will love this show.  It is incredible in every way.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Mad Men! The cable TV series first and second seasons are now out in video. This series won Emmy's for best actor and best dramatic series and a ton of other awards. Deals with Madison Avenue account executives at fictitious Sterling Cooper, first year covers 1960, second 1962. For those who remember, this series is astoundingly accurate in it's depiction of mores, attitudes, clothing styles of the time, perhaps more so than any other movie or series  I've ever seen. Ad guys swill liquor in their offices, shoot around ad ideas, flirt with and occasionally diddle secretaries in the office. Company Men in grey flannel suits, and women in red lipstick, full dresses with yards of crinolines, stockings and spike heels. It's a man's world! The Ad men smoke like proverbial chimneys. Everyone smokes. Women are housewives or sexy secretaries. Blacks are elevator operators, and maids. Gays don't exist. There is a great deal of insight into how Madison Avenue did (and still does) use our desires for happiness to manipulate and distort products thru advertizing. The Lucky Strike \\"toasted\\" ads (in season one)are a great example.<br /><br /> I have read where reviewers, younger ones, don't believe Mad Men. Well, if it's an exaggeration, it isn't an exaggeration by much. Some things are done for dramatic effect, to emphasis the difference between then and now - but this really was the times! In the second season, Peggy Moss, the plucky secretary who breaks into the all male account execs, gets invited to hear a Bob Dylan concert. The backdrop of historical events, racial problems, freedom riders, the space race, Marilyn Monroe, Kennedy and Nixon, sets off the action. Even the extra feature time capsules are fascinating. Jon Hamm, who my wife tells me is really handsome, plays Don Draper, the beleaguered, mysterious, complex, womanizing head of Creative at Sterling Cooper and won best actor. January Jones plays Betsy, his Barbie Doll wife. She appears in a swanky restaurant looking like a goddess, Don gazes at her and Rimsky Korsakov's lush \\"Song of India\\" starts playing (repeatedly in following episodes). When Betsy finds her young daughter smoking cigarettes in the closet, she diciplines her, not for taking a dangerous addictive drug, but because she might burn the house down being careless!<br /><br /> \\"The Times, They are a Changin'\\",  and this is a remarkable look at how things were just before they did!<br /><br />This series, can't be too highly recommended in a time when many movies are disappointing!  It's really the best thing out there, by a mile. Start from the beginning, season one, or it won't make sense. Very complex plots with a hundred plot lines at once. It shows what Hollywood can do if they really try.<br />(I rented these DVD's from the video store for this review)goddess, Don gazes at her and Rimsky Korsakov's lush \\"Song of India\\" starts playing (repeatedly in following episodes).

B0028K31CE|1.0|Cannot imagine why all the glowing reviews on this site for this CD.  Not at all the Maxwell sound that I grew to love over the 90's.  Have every other CD, and will pull those out when I'm in the need for some smooth, jazzy, mellow-voiced Maxwell--but this one will be resold.  His voice is tinny, the music hasn't any rhythmic beauty to it, and the lyrics are gravely seedy over many songs.  Just cannot fathom what the 5 star reviewers are listening to...unless they're his pals, etc.  Pass.
0810993139|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim over a year ago, and I'm glad I did. The humor is dead on, the situations are realistic to a middle school setting, and the characters are very easy to like. This book is perfect for kids of all ages, and it's especially great for kids who usually do not like to read!
B0018NF75G|5.0|I had low hopes when I got this book on CD from my library, and ended up LOVING it! Such a fun \\"read\\"! I couldn't want to get into my car. The reader (I forget her name) was a marvelous actress, who really brought the book to life. Super fun CD/book!
B0000C6K09|3.0|This is a great collection of John Williams music. I love that it has the suite arrangements on a lot of the music so that you get the best themes from the movies in a shorter amount of time. It has most everything I've heard of associated with John Williams up to its time. However, the performances of the music are not always that great. The orchestra sounds like it just wasn't up to scratch to play a lot of this music by the time they recorded. So, buying this CD is kind of give-and-take: you get a great selection of music, some of which is played at a sub-par level.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I must admit, I was dreading watching this movie. I bought into all the negative hype and figured 3 hours wasn't worth my time. I was terribly wrong. Once I started watching it I couldn't stop. I sat through the whole thing and enjoyed every minute. I've never read the graphic novel and don't plan on it. Just going on it's own as a movie I was able to figure out and follow everything. I didn't feel as though there was any inside info I was missing or detracted from the experience. Anyway, it was an overall good time and I'm sure I'll watch it again, soon.
B000EMGA3U|5.0|Great great great album!!! it has a raw feel to it from the band when they were just learning their trade and huge talent -- any true Sonic Youth fan must own this. Personal favourite song \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\"  9/10 album
B001VZY4M8|2.0|This has long been one of my favorite records and I was excited about the new master -- his recent Live at Canterbury House is pristine -- but I found the sound on this very muddled -- I thought my speakers (B&W 703) were blown, or my Rotel 1069 pre amp -- but it sounds the same on another amp, in my car. The Loner sounds better though...     As another reviewer said, I'm not sure you can tell much difference.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Seriously \\"Bitches Brew\\" is a better album than the more traditional \\"Kind Of Blue\\" , this album takes you on a super \\"Jazz Fusion\\" ride , my personal pick has to be the self-titled Bitches Brew it's 27mins of Jazz perfection from the master of them all Miles Davis. 10/10 album.
B00280LYHS|5.0|After reading this I miss the series so much. I want it to keep going. I love every single book. I can't wait until the movie comes out for the first book. It should be enjoyable. The whole series just has that essence of myths and Greek mythology that is amazingly put together. A lot of the adventures I read made me want to jump inside the book and join them in the battle! It's one of the best reads... I love it!
B0012GN260|3.0|After Iron Maiden's seven albums in the 80s, they pretty much were in a league of their own musically.  When this came out I snatched it up, and was very surprised that it was nothing like I expected.  Iron Maiden, and Bruce with them, had a powerful, mystical, and intelligent style that set them apart, where this album (and, to a lesser degree, the Iron Maiden albums that followed it) sounded more like mainstream hard rock/metal.  I expected more from Bruce, the metal genius who provided us with songs like \\"Revelations\\" and \\"Powerslave\\", but it seems that after having such high quality stuff with Maiden, here he was just having a bit of fun.    And, on that count, it works.  It's not epic or as musically intricate as Iron Maiden, but there's some good hard/rock metal here, and although some of the lyrics are more humorous/innuendo-ish (along the lines of AC/DC or Aerosmith), there's also some down-to-earth introspective lyrics about life and the world around him.  So, don't buy it expecting Iron Maiden, but it's certainly an enjoyable and listenable album.  (If you want to hear stuff along the lines of Iron Maiden, Bruce's later solo albums are excellent and more what you'd expect from him - try \\"Chemical Wedding\\", it's on a par with the best of Maiden, although it lacks Steve Harris's distinctive style).
0385342020|5.0|About six months ago I googled to see if Sophie Kinsella had a new book coming out...at that time there was only a title available--no details.  A few months later when I checked back I read the synopsis and was disappointed.  I've read all Kinsella's books, usually in one sitting but this one just sounded lame.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Looking for a summer read I picked it up anyways, and was beyond pleasantly surprised!  The character of Lara is likely Kinsella's most endearing and likeable character since the birth of Becky Bloomwood.  Even if you're not into \\"ghost stories\\" this one is definitely worth picking up, I guarantee you won't be able to put it down until you've finished it!
1400031362|2.0|I read the first volume of the \\"No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" and now volume 3. By comparison, vol 3 dwells too much on the personal lives of Mma Ramotswe and her husband to be. These parts of the book are uninteresting and did not engage me much. On the other hand, very little detecting is done in this book. The main character really handles only one case, and while in the first volume this was where her earthy wisdom shone through, here her advice is not as convincing, as if she has her mind on other things.     On the other hand, the minor characters in this book are delightful. It was good to see the assistent come into her own, and the mechanic apprentices insert a much needed comic note into the story.    In all, this book feels like the author is treading water, not sure where to take his characters. He is shifting from the series-of-vignettes to a more long form novel, but the result is not convincing. Yet.
0937381888|5.0|The title says it. If you buy just one book on home brewing, buy this book. I have bought every edition that has came out. It is that good. Almost everything I have learned in regards to home brewing has came from this book. I have bought just about every book there is on home brewing and have quite an extensive collection. This is the book I have on the table next to the Brewery every time I brew for quick reference. The author covers in simple detail every type of brewing from extract to all grain. He explains water, hop, grain, and other adjunct profiles in detail. All along it is written in a manner that even the complete novice can follow and understand and at the same time the old hand brewing veteran will find fascinating. You learn something new every time you pick it up to read. I have actually bought numerous copies of this book and given as gifts to friends who want to get into brewing or have just started out. I really can't heap enough praise on the quality of education in this book.
B0000062FL|5.0|...and also too good for Columbia Records.    This is one of the greatest records of all time.    If you like Bitches Brew, you would like this.  The way Black Magic Woman flows into Gypsy Queen (which is really a different song by Gabor Szabo) is a tour-de-force.
B001HADE00|5.0|Ratt's Out of the Cellar is a awesome record filled with great songs and performances by all of the band members. I consider this record to be stronger than Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil, which many consider to be the best record of that genre of music. When you consider that this was Ratt's first full length record, its all the more impressive. This record had a monster hit in Round and Round, but Wanted Man, Back for More and Lack of communications were just as good if not better. Those songs sound as great today and they did back then and have really stood the test of time. This record also had songs I'm Insane, You're in Trouble and Scene of the Crime which were very underated and have become fan favorites over the years. Juan , Robin, and Bobby made up a killer rythem section and Warren's leads are some of the best ever by a hard rock guitarist. Stephens singing and delivery was perfect for this time of music also.  This band also delivers these songs live and was not a studio band as these songs come alive in concert with a all new energy.  Great songs, great musicianship, and what a great job Beau Hill did in producing this record and getting a powerful rock sound.
