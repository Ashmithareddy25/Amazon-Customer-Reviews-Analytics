0385732554|5.0|It makes feel like a kid all over again. It is suspenseful and deep right from the start it is definitely a good bedtime story.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|don't listen to the bad reviews!!!some of the level are hard. but still fun.this is what I think FLING ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!:)
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Runs great on the droid 2, definetly more challenging than the first, but that scientist voice over is annoying. But overall so far so good.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game with nice graphics. Reminds me of super Mario games. Really couldn't believe it was free. Thank you very much!!
B007BVOF8E|3.0|This movie does neither the book nor the British mini-series justice. Gary Oldman can make just about anything work however and I did enjoy once again seeing his incredible skill as an actor. I just wish the movie itself could have been better by at least trying to do the book some justice.<br />It is worth a rental. In my opinion it is not worth purchasing nor worth a second viewing.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|The only comparable cans (same price range) I've owned are a set of Grado SR-60s, So I will compare to those. I use them solely with my laptop, and find no appreciable difference between the SR-80s and my SR-60s.<br /><br />Firstly, these K240s have a wider stage than the Grados, and clearer midrange. I'm not a thumphead, so that works for me. 20 hours of burn-in subdued the initial high-range harshness beautifully (I started Itunes at song-1, placed these headphones in a drawer, and let them \\"listen\\" for 20 hrs). I prefer symphony-like bass, for lack of a better description, and lightly adjusting my Itunes or Windows 7 EQ brings it out sufficiently for me.<br /><br />Those who say the Grados are painfully uncomfortable don't realize that you can CAREFULLY bend them out to a relaxed fit (I say carefully because once you've done so, you cannot bend them back without risk of breakage). Even so, the K240 is far more comfortable - amazingly so.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the lack of power in these K240s. I'm running a Little Dot MK-II 4-tube headphone amp, and with all volumes on maximum I'm not consistently reaching volume levels that I should (some yes, most no). There again, my music source is a late-model laptop with SRS \\"Premium\\" sound (for what that's worth).<br /><br />I am also concerned about the future of this thin K240 cord compared to the beefy one on my Grados.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Comfort<br />Wide sound stage<br />Clarity<br /><br />CONS:<br />Lack of power with laptop<br />Thin cord<br /><br />All things considered, you'll be hard-pressed to find better quality for under $100, probably even $150.

B005K0HDGE|1.0|I have been reading Stephen King books for almost 25 years now, and it pains me to say that I will not be reading anymore. I remember staying up until 4:00 in the morning on a school night unable to put down Pet Semetary because it was so gripping. This thing happened to me on numerous times while reading Mr. King's books. However, with 11/22/63, this was not the case. There were so many stretches in this book, that it started to feel like a child had written it. The way that issues were resolved, and the way things tidied themselves up, made it feel as if a first-time writer was in charge. I enjoyed the historical parts of this book as I was never much of a JFK historical buff, but the plot of the story itself was weak.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories Mr. King, unfortunately I have this book in my mind with which to remember you by.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|it worked fine i have no complaints.. its a light that changes to any color you want even white. you pick the color of light you would like to use.i found it quite helpfull when you dont want to turnnon lights!!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Some of the only complaints I've seen are that Irene Adler did not live up to expectations.  I say pip to that!  Moffat has absolute liberty to portray any character as he wishes.  This is honestly my favorite season of any TV show ever.  I watch a lot of television.  In fact, the only blatant flaw that I noticed, was in A Scandal in Belgravia the American accent was horrible.  Other than that, I found this season to display exemplary directing, acting, and writing on all fronts.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is soooooo addicing! once i start, i cant stop! i highly reccomend this app. thank you, END Games!!!!!!!!
B0068TJLSY|4.0|Okay, so the main roles are all played by young actors who have not been around for that long.  Doesn't matter.  Their performances are all top notch.  This is a terrific film full of creepy fun.  Nicely complemented by some genuinely funny parts.  Well worth your time.
B00756GKBA|4.0|Let me first start by saying I am no expert on Madonna at all. I do consider myself a pretty big fan (and I'm in the boat that has been a bit perturbed with her for letting the \\"younger crowd\\" such as Katy Perry and Lady Gaga steal her thunder in recent years. I know the younger artist always do that for newer generations (\\"Hello Justin Bieber, Paul McCartney who?\\"), I get that, but Madonna was always the Queen, no matter what generation came across to try to erase her. I also do not even own 'Hard Candy'. It's so bad I never even bought it, nor did I see any of the shows from its dumb tour. (I do like the remix of \\"Give It To Me\\" but that's where it ends).<br /><br />Let me also say, I absolutely despised \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\" upon first listen, upon second listen, upon the 20th listen. I still feel it's in her WORST songs ever recorded, let alone released as a lead single after a four year absence? A terrible song, a terrible video and I'm glad it stalled at #10 on the American Billboard Hot 100. It deserved to bomb.<br /><br />I watched the Super Bowl performance, and it drove me to tears because she did indeed \\"dazzle\\". I even shed a tear or two during \\"Like a Prayer\\" because it was so beautiful. The only problem was the performance of \\"Give Me All Your Luvin\\". I get that it tied in with the Super Bowl theme, but something like \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" or \\"Beautiful Killer\\" would have been so much better as the lead single and for the performance.<br /><br />Which leads me to \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", and its fantastic video. Madonna looking great, with a spoken word introduction, and very gay video. She's back !!<br /><br />Now it's time to pre-order 'MDNA' on iTunes, and it arrives on my iPod on the release day.<br /><br />OK, let me start my saying MDNA would have been excellent, phenomenal, 'Ray of Light'/'Music'/'Confessions' great if four songs were cut in the middle. I really don't think the record needs \\"Give Me All Your Lovin', \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Superstar\\" or \\"I'm Sinner\\". \\"Some Girls\\" isn't bad, but why not cut it to include the excellent \\"Beautiful Killer\\" or \\"I F'd Up\\" from the expanded version?<br /><br />Also, while I do think just because 'Ray of Light' or 'Music' or 'Confessions' are a peak for her (as well as 'Like a Prayer'), I do not think she needs to repeat those records to appease fans. Honestly, I do not want Part II of any of those records.<br /><br />I really didn't like 'MDNA' at all at first, at all. I think she was trying way too hard to stay current, way too hard to keep up with Britney, Katy and Gaga. I actually thought to myself, \\"The record sucks, but I'll see her live a few times, then I'm done, over her for good...\\" THEN I listened to 'MDNA' a few more times, then a few more times, then a few more times, and, lo and behold, it's completely grown on me. I'm addicted to \\"I'm Addicted\\", fascinated with \\"Gang Bang\\" (seriously, I can't wait to hear this live!), think \\"Turn on the Radio\\" is simply cute (or \\"neat\\"? :-). Unfortunately, that's when the record starts to lose me with the awful \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\", the filler \\"Some Girls\\" (seriously, the Rolling Stones have a \\"Some Girls\\" too, and it's MUCH better), the beyond crappy, \\"I Don't Give A\\" and the, again, filler \\"I'm a Sinner\\", then picks up steam again with \\"Love Spent\\", the gorgeous \\"Masterpiece\\" (she needs to release a ballad again as single very soon, she shines on \\"Masterpiece\\") and the absolutely stunning \\"Falling Free\\". I honestly think \\"Falling Free\\" fits in her best songs (\\"Oh Father\\", \\"Live to Tell\\", or even \\"To Have and To Hold\\"). \\"Free Falling\\" is exactly what Madonna needs to do now to retain \\"artist integrity\\" instead of trying to pump the radio waves with crap like \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\".<br /><br />I actually have nothing bad to say at all about \\"Beautiful Killer\\" (She needs to give herself a kiss for this wonderful song!), \\"I F'd Up\\", \\"BDay Song\\" (This song is just really dumb pop, not caring about airplay or \\"the big hit\\", thatwhy I like it) or \\"Best Friend\\". Repeating myself here but, the above mentioned \\"filler\\" songs should have been removed for all of the \\"expanded version\\" songs, and this record would have been considered a unabashed masterpiece.<br /><br />I will end with saying I recently saw 'MDNA' has hit #1 just about everyone, including America. How many current artists are going to be able to do that in 30 years? Does anyone think Lady Gaga is going to be #1 in 30 years? I will say that maybe Adele has some staying power but I doubt like Madonna. Congratulation to Madonna and yet another #1 record. :-)

0394818237|5.0|My son who is now 45 loved this book when he was 4-5.  It has to be one of the best children's books of all time.  I now buy them for my grandchildren, especially the grandsons.  Boys love this book and many of the the other Richard Scarry illustrated books.
1442419814|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best series I've ever read. I always go back to these books and they never fail to pull me right in. The world that Westerfeld creates is an intriguing and unique one, and his style of writing is wonderful. Uglies is a fantastic way to start off the series.<br /><br />What I loved most about this series is Westerfeld's talent in making you see both sides of the story, and reasoning behind what the cities do, and what the rebels do. Often times I found myself switching sides because his writing is just that good.<br /><br />Uglies is a definite must read for all age groups.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|The elements in this movie are pretty standard for this genre: wide-eyed enthusiastic kids, some of which have serious personal problems; a small cozy town where everyone knows each other; a branch of the military engaged in a secret program of questionable ethics; an ugly alien creature which crashed on our planet and just wants to return to home, but has been detained and tormented enough to make it dangerous, but it still has a heart; lots of impressive special effects; and a relatively happy ending.<br /><br />If all these elements came together well enough, this could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, some of these elements felt like caricatures, and their blending often felt contrived.  In other words, the movie felt too formulaic, rather than developing from a fully matured vision.<br /><br />I asked my daughter what she thought of it, and she said it was good, but she didn't love it.  I guess I felt about the same.  I suppose you could do worse than to watch it, but I can't strongly endorse it.  Certainly not destined to become a classic.
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris is always so calm in his writings. He doesn't use up energy to be aggressive.  This was a great follow up to his previous book The Moral Landscape, where he talks briefly about free will. This book is really short, and covers everything there really is to say about \\"free will\\".  This is one of those books you want to pass around to your friends so that you can all discuss next time you're all together. Fun mental exercise!!<br /><br />=)<br /><br />I love Sam.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Buy this for your kids or grandkids and you will get many hugs and be a real popular person.  Very high resolution and quality.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|As a movie it was just so-so as the story has already been done and the original was outstanding so how would this hold up? I bought the movie when it first came out and watched then just set it in a pile of movies that have little to no replay value.<br /><br /> However after getting the bluray 3D version I was impressed at just how much my opinion of this movie changed. Being made as a pure 3D movie when it hit theaters this version is outstanding. As a rule many movies are somewhat darker as we were the Polarized Glasses. However this was not the case with this version. It is one of the brightest (if not the brightest) 3D titles that I have. As far as movies go the only other title that I have that is as bright as this is Captain America. Do not get me wrong...I have numerous titles that are in 3D but most are CGI movies...Monsters Versus Aliens...MegaMind..Shrek..Dispicable Me..Avatard has a ton of CGI but just not as bright. That's why I say the only other \\"Movie\\" that is comparable is Captain America. As far as brightness it all varies on the type of equipment one has, I have a Mitsubishi so yours may be brighter than mine.<br /><br /> My 5 star rating is based solely on the 3D and while it may not have the most out of screen effects the quality of 3D turned this from borderline 3 star viewing to something I will be able to watch several times. I can not say that you are going to love this or it is a must have all I can tell you is that I was glad I bought the 3D Bluray version. I just would not pay over 20-30 tops for it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is great - just listening to it read as I work is great for my feeling of always being connected.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|First, Amazon should provide the Fire with the ability to play the very popular AVI formatted movies.  Second, I downloaded this app and was never able to play my AVI files with it as well.  I suppose it can be made to work if you have time to read all the instructions and jump through the hoops.  But I only like apps which \\"load and go\\".  I erased this app already.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book!  I don't have anything new to add but since I heavily use Amazon reviews to make my purchase decisions, I wanted to add 1 more 5 star review.
B003BKF696|5.0|I've had this album coming up on a year now and am increasingly realizing what a gem it is. Others have pointed out that it really is a solid album as opposed to a collection of singles - with a consistent feel from beginning to end - and its one of the few recent purchases that I do listen to from beginning to end. And as happens with many great albums, I find myself discovering that tracks I initially thought we just ok are actually awesome.<br /><br />Check if you like the lead singer's voice and the mastering etc. that others have found fault with (listen to the samples), and if you do, just save yourself some time, money and regret and buy the whole thing!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game except when an ads pops on that's video and blasts the sound. Other than that it's solitaire with all the rules you could need and has a cool feature to only give you winnable games
B007MNV5WU|1.0|yes this game blows.. not very fun. and the controls feel a bit off. don't waste your 3 dollars. just stick to the original. 1 star for me
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. Reviews had been mixed. I have tons of old cassettes that I have been itching to convert. Thought I would give it a go. I even paid up in hopes of getting better brand - had 3+ stars also. First song worked well, then it was all downhill. First I thought it was my old tapes, but any tape I put lead to same result. Tape would get wound up and jam. Returned within 24 hours.not worth the hassle. looking to try to convert using good quality tape player and using mic for input via audacity and see if this way can work.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I finished all five books in this series in just over 2 months and I want more!  Over 5000 pages of text and the story is nowhere near completion.  The only problem I have with GRRM's style is that he spends way too much time describing food.

073663763X|1.0|The product detail states Conner O'brien is the narrator (whom my daughter wanted) but it wasn't him after all... it's Scott Brick... I ordered this under the assumption it was Conner and wouldn't have had I known... This may not be a big deal breaker for some people but if your going to put the name of the narrator in the product details at least get it right... Scott Bricks voice is irratating to my daughter... different things bother different people and we need the right information to make an informed decision before buying a product.... The book how ever is fantastic if you don't mind a slow start... get past the first chapter and you'll love it as millions have...thanks for listening.....
B0015KO52S|5.0|Shades of Zeppelin, the Stones, even Queen and all made uniquely their own. A great album, consistent from the snarling opening track, to the jazz influenced You Don't Understand Me to the wild alternate/southern/whatthehellisit of track 14 which tells a VERY enlightening tale. I've always liked Jack White and this only elevates him in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, finished the second in the series, Catching Fire, and now am on the 3rd, MockingJay, almost finished.  Glad that I read it before seeing the movie, although like Twilight now we have to wait so long for the 2nd and 3rd movie to come out.<br />Hard to imagine that the future would come to this, but given the popularity of reality shows now, it is certainly not hard to imagine them a few steps further for the audience's pleasure.  After all look at how excited people can get over sporting events when there are injuries, or the accidents in car races, not to mention boxing, WWF, and cage fighting!!!!!! Won't be too many generations when we will become immune to the violence we inflict on others, and pass it off just like the kids that are playing their violent video games now!  But then again is this much different than the giving up that we do now of our sons and daughters to the military?????<br /> I am not against any of this, it is just that this book makes you stop and think about what our future children will have to face, because of what we have done before them.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I very excitedly open the Amazon shipping box only to be shocked and dismayed at the condition of the Box Set inside.  The left side was torn and completely separated from the front.  The \\"folder headers\\" were bent.  There are dents on the underside of the top flap.  The dvds are in wrappers but the wrappers are all bent and hanging out of the folders.  There is a sticker on the front of the box that when peeled off, takes the covering with it.<br /><br />This is not a New product as was indicated on the order.<br /><br />A call to Amazon will net me a return box and a refund of my money, but I have to order the box set again.  This one came from Chaim Fisher.<br /><br />I am surprised Amazon does not have more quality control.  I hope they take notice and look into their relationship with Chaim Fisher.  This was not a new product.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  Had I not seen this author on the Africa Channel I would've never known about this.  I am so happy that I saw her talk about this and became intrigued.  She said in the interview that some people have told her they think her father wrote the book instead of her because of the stark reality of her description of what happened during the war.  She said she takes it as a compliment because that means that the story seems very real to them.  After reading it I understand what they meant.  She did her homework and put together a wonderful book.  This is EXCELLENT reading for a book club.  I loved the character Ugwu and the last few sentences touched my heart.<br /><br />This books shows clearly ties between people that you love (family or not) and the horrendous tragedies that happen during war as well as the unconscionable politics that accept unnecessary human suffering.  It shows how even during the worst times life goes on and during the best times how we can be so petty, prideful and truly ignorant.  It also clearly shows how you can lose your mind during the worst times and not be able to bring yourself back from the brink of madness.  I applaud this author for writing this book and showing many different sides from the houseboy, to the middle class academic, to the arrogance of the native rich African and the westerners who enter that world and think they know better.  I look forward to reading her other books and enjoying them just as much.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|I was entertained by this movie even though I'm sure that the writers wanted more than that.  It was typical action adventure with a bit of romance.  However, the twist is that the monetary system is built around how much time a person has to live.  As entertainment, I give the movie 4 stars.  It is a nice way to spend an evening, but I would see no point in owning a copy of IN TIME.  As political commentary, it is rather juvenile and leaves much to be desired.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game for card junkies a like. Get this app its challenging and logictical! its free and easy to download!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I agree 100% with the people who loved this movie.  Forget the self-important reviews above and their talk of how the movie didn't quite make it or it was too this or that.  If you could watch it and not feel for the people in the story, then you should not be writing a review.  I mean one of those reviewers even referred to Oskar as \\"troubled\\".  He was not troubled.  He was just fine and dealing with his emotions and pain instead of ignoring them.  If you have ever watched a child (or anyone for that matter) go through something hard, that you know they must, then you will appreciate this movie.<br />On a more technical note, I loved the way this story was told, the camera work, lighting, pacing, back and forth scenes and so on.  Also it was told very bravely and honestly.  Oskar was not prettied up nor made into a caricature of a child.<br />All of this completely drew me into this world.  I could do nothing but feel with them, nor did I want to.<br />My advice is: Watch this movie!
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|As many others have stated, this review does not reflect the series but rather the media it comes on.  I was able to watch the first three episodes before the discs stopped loading on any of my bluray players.  I updated the software on each (Sony, Denon, computer) to no avail.<br />Just printed the return label...<br /><br />I understand this is an ongoing problem with many Bluray discs-- the anti-piracy coding prevents them from playing at all.  Way to go Sony...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitare does not dissapoint. The app runs well and is addictive.  What more could you ask from a free game.
0439023521|5.0|I was hesitant about reading this book for well over a year because I was so certain I would not like it. It did not seem like \\"my kind\\" of book. But I read a number of reviews by book reviewers that I trusted, and I figured the time had come to read it when I happened to win a copy of it. And with the upcoming film, I knew it was now or never.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I was drawn into this book like I very rarely am drawn into books. The writing style was impeccable, and the characters were incredibly well-crafted. It was also frightening when I realized that what was being spoken of could actually happen some time in the future.<br /><br />I found that I repeatedly forgot where I was as I read (even when I was subbing in a classroom of students), and all I wanted to do was read this book and nothing else. I found myself thinking about the main characters and wanting to know what would happen in the story. I wanted to believe that the author would not allow the unthinkable to happen, but I wasn't sure. And I will tell you that the book does not end how you would like it to end, but it ends the way it should. If the author had chosen to end it differently, I don't think I would even be considering reading another book in the series. I wouldn't even think about it being part of a series.<br /><br />I am absolutely \\"taken\\" with Suzanne Collins. She is one of the best authors I have read in recent times. I appreciate the fact that there was almost no profanity of any kind (only one word that I recall, and it was not even that bad). There is no sex (go figure--a YA book with no sex!). And she knows exactly how to keep you guessing. Although the science fiction, futuristic elements are there, everything makes sense. You aren't left wondering why thus and such happened--you know why! The action was mesmerizing, and the unexpected love story was absolute genius! She even has a sense of humor that comes out at exactly the right time.<br /><br />This is a book that I can unequivocally recommend to anyone who enjoys reading fiction. It makes no difference if you like historical fiction, romance, science fiction, action, or an genre! This should be at the top of your TBR list if you have not read it!<br /><br />One other thing I would like to add is to thank the author for such a positive message for young people (and everyone)even when dealing with such a dark topic. And the message is resonating with young people. As I read the book, I was asked by so many teenagers about the book. Many had read it and said how much they liked it. It is good to see an author write about a character who stayed true to what she believed and did not forsake her morals. She didn't let anyone change her! Thank you, Katniss!
B00127RAJY|1.0|I did the level one for 10 days and my knee began to ache around day 6/7 and thought it would wear off and just needed extra stretching. Fast forward to level 2, day 2 KILLER knee, popping sounds, etc, can barely move around. I am a runner and average weight at 110 lbs (average 10-12 miles/week) and never had any knee issues. I attributed it to the lunges in level 2, but perhaps it is the jumping jacks, not sure. I am going to stick to running and try the ab workout dvd instead.

It breaks for no reason after about 6 weeks.  It just flashes and flashes and shuts off and can never sync with the dongle.<br /><br />Perhaps a round of beatings at the child labour sweatshop where it was manufactured will improve the quality.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Te book is a very good one and the conclusion that I infere is that the multiverse of universes is mandatory because universes emerge from quantuum fluctuations in what is called empty space that is our familiar einsteinean spacetime. A single singularity (the seed of a universe) before spacetime were created is impossible because in that case nothing existed, it was a basolutely nothingness and in an absolute nothingness there were nothing (no quantum fluctuations)in which a singularity would emerge. Another conclusion is that the multiverse must be eternal in time and infinite in space because if it had a begin this begin was a singularity in the nothingness and this is impossible as above. Moreover our universe is fine tunned to the existence os stars, galaxies, planets, heavy elements and eventually life and would be an impossible coincidence a single universe appears with this finetunning carachteristics. Only in a multiverse with a infinite number of universes each one with different physics and constants of nature a few of them (a few in an infinite number is still a number infinite)can born with the right tunning to have stars, galaxies etc... Of course this conclusions is excluding the existence of God. If God exists, well, in that case everything is possible.
9714721180|5.0|Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite Metallica album. It presents a fast and harsh music and lyrics, respectively, similar to that style of Slayer. I often state that Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums.
B0019UGYK0|4.0|This DVD arrived on time and worked well. I purchased it new, and I was not disappointed. I would buy again.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This is a great start for this series. Westerfield does a great job of combining the teen mindset with his post-apocalyptic world. Finding out certain things about the world -- like the way the Uglies insult each other, and even the fact that they're called Uglies -- is disturbing, but it's necessary to set up the sense of how the world works.<br /><br />Since there are so many reviews that give a plot synopsis, I won't repeat that here. I will say that I enjoyed the world setup and the characters. Tally isn't perfect, by any means (which is great, honestly), but she's smart enough to know that the world as presented to her doesn't quite feel right to her. Sure, she wants to be pretty like everyone else -- a few years of looking at New Pretty Town, plus teen hormones, would do that to anyone. But she doesn't swallow everything hook, line, and sinker, and when the big bad guys try to manipulate her... well, you'll just have to read that for yourself.<br /><br />It's a fun ride, and that's all I was after with this.
1451673442|5.0|A very helpful guide, step by step, different from the two former books written by Mrs Byrne.<br />Enjoyable,useful. I recommand it.
B004QIUGTC|5.0|Their live album is seemingly a great masterpiece off of their original studio recording materials released from previous albums. I really like their song list which didn't include some of the overplayed songs from other live recordings. Green day should start playing other rare live songs more to diversify their musical innovation instead of just focusing on popular hits like many other bands.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well I have just finished this masterpiece about 10 minutes ago.<br /><br />Why masterpiece? As someone with no knowledge of what constitutes good, just what I like, this book will haunt me for a long time.<br />I took a chance and downloaded the trial copy which I then breezed through for an hour when I decided that I didn't want to stop when I got to the end of it, so I bought the omnibus and basically haven't been able to put it down.<br />I would describe it as a simple and easy book to read, but manages to be a gripping yarn (sorry but I just had to) that burrowed deep into my mind.<br />Many other reviews explain the storyline and characters well.  I just want to tell you to take the chance and be prepared for late nights.
B0073XORCY|1.0|Well, following some good reviews I pulled the trigger...sorry fellows, for the hardcore insane and blind fans, but I have been an old timer Tull fan since the 60's, and I stopped on Stormwatch...period...this is just a bad  joke...another way of getting your hard earn pennies from your pocket with commercial material, it is not even comparable to the solo Ian albums, which I own, as I do consider them better than the Tull later albums...it is even worst...WTF is Ian thinking while he released this album, please, seriously man, stop releasing mediocre material, this is just a joke...Thick as a Brick is your best album ever, naming this joke \\"thick as brick 2\\" is simply an insult...and no, of course not, this is not his best effort since Heavy Horses, as someone posted here trying to play \\"I know all about Tull\\", sorry to disagree, but to me, any Ian solo album is better than this crap...I'm returning it, as on top, the DVD was defective!!!!

0439023513|1.0|a thought provoking world comes to a pathetic end. The ending was a mixture of blah and depression. I left it thinking really this is the final FINAL book. This is the ending? Katniss,Haymitch,Gale,Prim and the others deserved better. This ending made me disappointed in investing in the series and not eager to read more from author if promosing series end like this one did. Also this is one teen series were the story and heroine would have been served better if there was no romance in it. That really brought the character of Katniss down. It felt forced and more cheesy that Harlequin romance novel. The romance was unnatural and annoying. The book should have cut that out completely and focused on the the action and the community and friendship loves and bonds. The rebellion, families and friendships were incredible throught the series and deserved better and more. I really wish this wasn't the final book cause it was a crappy ending and it's too bad the movies seem to be true to the book because I would love it if they would change and fix this lackluster ending.
B005QI4TTY|5.0|Ok , so Where should I begin ?! Drake really did his thing on his sophomore album , Take Care !! If your a fan of Drake , you would agree with me here. Every one of the tracks on this album are pure GOLD ! None of them suck , unless your a guy and find Drake totally annoying. Well, cmon, most of Drakes fans are FEMALES ,so of course some of the tracks are gonna be a little slow and targeted towards women. But, don't worry guys, tracks like \\" Underground Kings\\" & \\"Lord Knows\\" have more of a masculine feel to them. But anyway , it really doesn't matter if your a girl OR a guy because all of the tracks are just so amazing !! This album is so good, its just impossible to skip a track .. TRUST ME . :)<br /><br />Favorite Track: I love all the songs on Take Care but , the track called \\"The Ride\\" featuring a trending underground artist named The Weeknd . This song is just so soothing but dope!! & I just love The Weeknd's voice and just The Weeknd in general !! :D<br /><br />-duces :)

B004A8ZWWO|3.0|Though there is much action here, it's still a little too long and that drags this movie down. Obviously, they are playing off the Bernie Madoff scandal with the plot here. Eddie Murphy somewhat upstages his co-stars, because he talks so fast, compared with them. Alan Alda is the bad guy, and he ain't too bad. There's a big caper at the heart of this, but, ultimately, I really didn't care what happened one way or the other. The ending is also a little off key.
B007Q476KU|1.0|Corny, slow, and cliched, Warhorse is basically all the tropes of horse movies rolled into one. Nothing original, with cardboard-cutout characters, ridiculously constantly neighing/snorting/heavily breathing horses, ending so smarmy I thought my eyes would roll right out of my head. Sorry - I was really looking forward to this one, but it was basically Black Beauty with a little Black Stallion and Seabiscuit rolled in for good measure. And all of those were better movies than this one (even the egregiously slow Seabiscuit).
B002ZG981E|5.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect Ratio:  2.40:1 (it is hard to tell the difference between 2.4:1 and 2.35:1).<br />Sound: DTS-HD 5.l Master Audio<br />Length: 2 hours and 21 minutes (I don't count the credits).<br /><br />Both the audio and video were excellent.  I have no complaints.  There was plenty of surround sound and low, sub-woofer bass.  I didn't see any grain at all, and blacks had no distortion.  I give both audio and video 10.0 on a 10.0 scale, and I rarely do that.<br /><br />I thought the movie was amazing, but I found it hard to follow at times.  I think I got about 70% of it, but I watched it at 3:00 AM, and had a hard time staying awake.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Excellent cap. What else to expect from Nikon. Tight sits down on lens. Recommended to everyone who have not nikon lenses.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|This is a film in a category by itself.  It's a thriller, perhaps.  It's a mystery, perhaps.  It's political, perhaps.  It doesn't comfortably fit into any one, all-inclusive category and it doesn't use any cliches I've ever seen.  The photography is amazing and the actors manage well enough.  This isn't an actor's film.  The mystery angle is given to the viewer to piece together an abundance of information scattered along the way.  There is suspense, but not of any traditional kind.  Its implications are political, economic and moral.  What we don't know can definitely hurt us - and has - and is.<br /><br />Curtis Stotlar
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Jason Momoa could not have been a more perfect choice for Conan, but it seems the script writer went missing after the first half of the movie. What started out as an action-packed story with pretty good characters turned into a lot of blank stares and dumb moves. Conan drops the heroine back off at her ruined home as if he's saying good-night after a date. Whoever directed this is clueless. Don't they have test audiences watch these? If they make a sequel, I really hope they get a different director and writer!
B000V6OMU2|5.0|Dope album it seems that it had the refined version to all the songs I had from other underground albums but the message still the same Peace!.. Kick back spark a spliff and lets understand as friends
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game play is fun but you run out of energy quickly and it takes along time for it to regenerate. Also like alot of other games from gameloft you have to pay real money to get a number of items in the game.

B000W1V5VU|3.0|First there was &#34;Ocean's Eleven&#34; and it was a mildly interesting, mildly entertaining, mildly amusing movie. No big deal, but above average. Then came &#34;Ocean's Twelve&#34; and it was just not a good follow-up. Well, what are you going to do? I've got this three-pack of Ocean movies so I bit the bullet and put &#34;Ocean's Thirteen&#34; on for late night entertainment. Well, it was back to Las Vegas and that was a relief. Hmmm. The soundtrack seemed to be better and was actually more interesting than the movie in a lot of places. Maybe that's trying to tell you something about the movie. It was a snorer. The photography was good enough that it actually made Las Vegas look rather good. How do they do that? Have you ever been to Las Vegas? Have you ever looked at the city out and away from the tourist area? Well here I go drifting away from the movie again. I guess that's just how the movie went. Boring. I just couldn't keep my mind on it. My wrist watch seemed to be more interesting. It was something about stealing diamonds and such. And there was a lot of effort devoted to shorting the casino. And there was an earthquake machine. Oh hell, the production values were high and everything was well done. I just wish some more work couldn't have gone into the script. Also, I got awfully tired of watching Brad Pitt feeding his face. Hopefully, there's not an Ocean's Fourteen.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun to play and a good time killer. I also have it on my phone. I will even let my two children play it. It reminds my a lot of the old Mario brothers game.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|love this app. would have lost or forgotten many things if not for evernote. works very well between all my devices.
B005FITIGO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Margin Call.<br /><br />It was suspenseful and fascinating watching a fictional account of what most likely took place at one or two financial institutions during the beginning of the GFC. The director did a good job reflecting the diversity of motivations between self-protection and corporate/social responsibility. Jeremy Irons character was truly outstanding in his merciless disregard for others, whether they be his employees, customers or the general populace. He simply didn't care. Modern day evil.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone. I think one probably needs to have some interest in the particular events, the corporate world and/or financial merry-go-round of the investment world.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|É um ótimo livro sobre um tema polêmico e complexo, temos ou não temos livre arbítrio? De acordo com Sam, nossa ideia de livre arbítrio é ilusória, pois processos mentais que não controlamos tomam as decisões antes do consciente. Há várias provas e experimentos para provarem este ponto de vista.
0439023513|3.0|Good story. Didn't make some of the choices I was hoping for, but as some critiques have mentioned, this book wasn't about what I wanted. Collins wanted to shift gears and make a statement about the destructive nature of war, and that's what she accomplished. It's not the choices she made in closing the Hunger Games trilogy that bothered me. What bothered me was the manner in which she made this transition.<br />It's easy to conceive that a seventeen year old would eventually fracture under repeated emotional and physical trauma. A good portion of Mockingjay is spent watching her dwell over her own incapability, and it's a very natural and believable expression of a young lady who has taken more than she can handle. There is no specific point along the journey one can say without a doubt that a mistake was made in how the story was conveyed. Collins did a very good job keeping the story legitimate.<br />However, I feel very conflicted about this book, and not in the right way. I should be reflecting on the barbaric atrocities of war. Instead I'm reflecting on how peculiar and unnatural the transition of theme and tone felt to me.<br />The phrase \\"getting in your head\\" is what comes to mind. I feel that Collins became too devoted to pushing her personal agenda to critique war, and lost perspective. In doing this, she turned her characters into expendable hunks of meat to be arbitrarily thrown to the fire at her whim. I could feel her depraved touch in the plotline of every chapter, filled in with drug induced comas, self-defeating ruminations and character redundancy. A good story can have rich characters, riveting story and still deliver a powerful message. The message she sought to convey was weakened by her own observable effort to endorse it.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I mean they can't all be 5 stars. Can they? On the same plane as Born to Run? I'm no statistician but I sense a contingent of blind five star voters. After forty years, yes, it is conceivable that the Boss can miss the mark. For me, I'm not seeing five star efforts from him over the last ten years. Good but not five stars. At least not to the five star level of his majestic 70's and 80's output (i.e. five star land where albums have impact twenty, thirty years after their release). Have we reached the point where we need to throw out the high and low votes similar to the old Cold War Olympic voting (\\"The East German judge's vote shall be thrown out, as well as, Frank's from Jersey\\") to make the Amazon poll relevant? Don't get me wrong his output remains solid. However I find it interesting that Bruce's concerts now play fewer and fewer of the new stuff unlike the past when the concert revolved around each new album (and I haven't missed an album concert since 1978). Of course there can be many reasons for this, and I am not saying he lacks confidence in his new stuff. I like the new sounds, added musicians and freshness to this album. And yes my streak of concerts will continue.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is the most comprehensive series I have ever seen on the subject of life on earth. If you're going to buy this Blu-Ray, make sure you buy the one narrated by David Attenborough and NOT the one narrated by Oprah Winfrey. I'm sorry, but anyone who's being honest will agree that Oprah Winfrey narrating a scientific program is distracting to the point of annoyance.
0307474259|2.0|Anytime there exists as much contradictory evidence as there is in the field of nutrition (e.g., Atkins vs. Ornish), it means that nobody really knows what the hell is going on.<br />There seems to be little recognition that diets must be tailored to the individual, based on that person's genome and epigenome. That will come later, after us.<br />For now, I've compromised and am living on pizza and German chocolate cake. Happy now, Atkins and Ornish? I am.<br />If diet books helped lose weight, Americans would be the skinniest people on earth.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games was equally as good as the first one was.  It was very exciting.
B00008A7QK|5.0|I'm slowly working my way to owning the 500 best albums by Rolling Stone magazine. I don't love everything on their list, but so far I have purchased many cd's. Electric Warrior was listed as #160. I still have many more to go. Before I purchased the cd, I sampled some of the songs. After I received the cd and listened to it in it's entirety I was able to appreciate the music more. It's better than I expected. You can't go wrong with this cd if you love rock music.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|Its odd to rate a corny movie 5-stars. The more hokey it got, the funnier it got. It's worth looking at if you are just looking for something different! I would call it a serious spoof of Friday the 13th and the Beverly Hillbillies.

B000VK99Z6|4.0|Good movie, funny, and didn't expect the plot to go in that direction.  Would recommend.<br />Though kind of pricey for the age of the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|OK. I read all three books. Fact is, I devoured all three books. I found the story engrossing, ever surprising, and at the end I was left...well...as satisfied as possible. The story is dark and it doesn't really get any brighter as it goes along. It's a story about war and the horrors of war and what human beings do to one another.<br /><br />I'm content in the fact that it doesn't have a truly 'happy' ending and that it kept true to itself. I respect that and probably wouldn't have expected everyone to go dancing through a field of daisies at the end. Thank goodness I didn't, because that's far from the result.<br /><br />What I find disturbing, but yet still endearing is that I really never came have a great affinity for Katniss. I liked her in the first book, despite her cold indifference to the poor boys who vie for her affections. By the second book, it got old.<br /><br />Although I understand that she feels that 'everything' that is happening is a direct result of 'her', it really isn't. She's too totally absorbed with her own guilt trip, her own constant self-loathing, self-pity, self-absorption.<br /><br />I quickly tired of her fugues and angst and just plain whaa, whaa, whaa.<br /><br />Yeah, she's tough and talented. She steps up and wants to be more than the powers that be want her to be, but still, she's just not loveable. I can't imagine the horror of what she goes through. Please understand. My problem is that she takes everything so very personally and can't see the forest for the trees, something she points out that Haymitch is quite good at.<br /><br />I try to keep reminding myself that she's only 17 and that her degree of selfishness and similar self-loathing would perhaps be so typical of someone her age. In the book, her dark nature, determination, quiet introspection, and strength 'inspire' people, if only from a distance. Good thing too, because up close, she's a complete drag. Like Haymitch, she has no joy and brings no joy. I understand that her world holds very little joy, of course. Still, I find myself wanting to shake her out of her pity party soooo many times.<br /><br />Fortunately, the author doesn't try to make excuses for her. In fact, she actually confirms what this reader feels when a conversation between Peeta and Gale confirms that both boys feel that Katniss will choose the one of them that she feels that 'she cannot live without'. Not the one she loves, but simply a selfish decision based on what's best 'for her' to continue her future.<br /><br />Pretty much nails the character, unfortunately.<br /><br />Oh, yes, she does the 'right' thing in the end, she emerges with her dignity and pride intact, but the road to the finale was long and arduous and full of 'me, me, me'.<br /><br />Still, I really enjoyed the books and look forward to the movie.<br />I just hope we don't have to endure quite so many forays into closets and utility rooms.hat her world holds very little joy, of course.

B007N5YIUS|2.0|For the few moments when it works this is a really cool version of Angry Birds.

B000GW8RX4|5.0|I always loved Rainbow.  When this came out I knew I would get it.  My only reservation was sound quality.  I have bought several old concert DVDs and Blu-rays that are just about unwatchable because of the sound quality.  A couple of Thin Lizzy releases come to mind.  I'm listening in DTS and the sound is great.  Crowd noises in the surrounds and music in front with a little reverb in back.  Pretty realistic to my ear. Good performances from Dio,Cozy Powell and of course Blackmore.  If you like any of these guys, don't hold back.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|At first, I didn't get Lana Del Rey. I had heard her two big hits, \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" several times on Pandora and Groveshark and didn't think twice about the songs. I decided to check out her album \\"Born to Die\\" and was surprised. Lana Del Rey has such a unique voice that grows on you each time you hear her sing. \\"Off To The Races\\" really shows off her vocal versatility.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is honestly the greatest CD I have listened to in a while- I purchased this copy for my mother's birthday gift, and she absolutely loves it as well. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good music!
0345803485|2.0|First off I will put it out there: I was a Twilight fan (at least the first book anyway). If the actual relationship between Ana & Christian in any way mirrored Bella & Edward, I might have been happy.  Other than general descriptions of the characters, I found the similarities ended there.  What I enjoyed about Twilight was this sense of almost an old fashioned romance between B & E. In 50 Shades of Grey there is no romance, really--just 2 characters that meet and have a sexual attraction.  They don't develop any sort of relationship, just start having sex. I thought the storyline might have worked better if the characters were about 10 yrs older (or being so young, if Ana was a LOT more mature). Ana seemed like she was 21 going on 12 and I found it impossible to believe that a 27 yr old, successful, billionaire type would have any interest in someone as immature as Ana (no matter how hot he thinks she is).  The author never really allows you inside Christian's head or provides real answers about who he is or why he is so controlling--presumably so she can stretch this \\"mystery\\" out into books 2 & 3.  I didn't find the sex scenes \\"hot\\" but rather ridiculous and unbelievable.  It's hard to buy into two characters having chemistry when they just begin the story by having sex. I can believe it if somewhere along the way they fell in love, but by the time you reach the end of the novel it's too late to care.  I have no interest in what happens in book 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if I could play this all day I definitely would. it is so fun and there r so many different little games to play on it.
B0052GACNM|3.0|I listen to Duets 1 in my car so often, I was really looking forward to its follow up. Have to say I am not as happy with this one. Bennett is his expected smooth self albeit not as enthusiastic as on the first album and unfortunately some of his partners on this are ill-suited to the music/song choices.  But what was especially  disappointing to me was the lack of camaraderie and personality on this album. On Duets 1 evident in the vocals as well as improvised comments there was a sense that Mr. Bennett and his song partners enjoyed working with each other as artists and on a personal level --that they connected to make this more than mere strangers brought together to sing. That sense of emotion was lacking on this album. Perhaps looking at the line-up of artists helps explain this a bit -- how do you replicate a lineup that includes Streisand, Billy Joel, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Dixie Chicks, Stevie Wonder.. Someone unfamiliar with Duets 1 might not notice the mutual joy at singing together.<br /><br />Lady Gaga stands out -- she sounds great -- and she and Bennett had such a good time together, which helps the listener do so as well. Josh Groban would be another favorite - can never tire of his voice -- and I liked Queen Latifah doing Who Can I turn to which seemed a bit of a departure for her. My least favorite cut - and it breaks my heart to have to say this -- is Aretha -- boy-oh-boy was this a bad choice for her -- after several trys to listen to it, I now find myself skipping to the next song  --it is that painful to listen to. The album seems heavy on pairings with female vocalists - may contribute to the missed connections.<br /><br />I do hope there is a Duets 3, 4 and 5 in the offing -- and have some partners for Mr. Bennett to consider --John Bon Jovi, Adele, Susan Boyle, Seal, Enrique Iglesias,  -- how about a Duets Album that features some of the artists of old time rock 'n roll that are still around and sounding great: Neil Sedaka, Paul Anka, Bobby Vinton, etc and last, but most definitely not least -- would love Mr. Bennett to do a Broadway Duets album with actual Broadway stars: Ben Vereen, Nathan Lane, Barbara Cook, Patti LuPone, Mandy Patinkin, Neil Patrick Harris, and others.

B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Another GREAT book... I loved it from start to finish, and they way he left it for the third book was just brilliant.<br />I find sometimes with a second or third book, there can be a huge amount of info on the previous read and it canbecome boring and annoying.

1250008409|2.0|My experience in meditation is very limited.  I've only read two books on the subject, but wanted to continue learning.  I chose \\"Get Some Headspace\\" because it offers the Take 10 program which integrates mindfulness with active lifestyles.<br /><br />I discovered not all self-help books are created equal.  Andy Puddicombe's book is easy to read, but lacks substance.  At 214 pages, it's a smattering of analogies and snippet pieces of advice.  It reminded me of an old home repair book--not enough useful information conveyed to actually get anything fixed.  The first one hundred pages are basically stories about Andy Puddicombe's difficult attempts at learning how to meditate at various monasteries.  Supposedly these tales are in the book to help readers better grasp the Take 10 program without having to go through the same grueling ordeals Andy did as a monk.  Some are extreme anecdotal examples.  I wondered why many were even included.<br /><br />The actual Take 10 program is explained in just a few brief pages in the middle of the book, and involves the most basic breathing routine.  By comparison, another book I read, [[ASIN:B005E833CA The Power of Prana]], also offers a breathing routine.

1595827684|5.0|As a big mass effect fan, I bought this book.. well.. Kinda just for the heck of it. But it's really more then just another \\"thing\\" to add to the collection. This book is PERFECT. It contains artwork from all three games, and is filled with beautiful pictures that will more then satisfy any Mass Effect fan.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like it. Its almost like super Mario but it has its own little twist to it. I don't think it would be a bad Idea to have Mario on the amazon store. I give it 4 stars.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is my very first review. I just had to share my thoughts on this book. It touched my heart in so many ways. I laughed, I cried, and I deprived myself of sleep to finish this book and its sequal in record time. I see a really promising future for this talented writer. Buy this book but make sure you have kleenex and plenty of sleep before you start.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it was fun kinda cool takes a lot of ENERGY tho. bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great and I love it. I love unlocking the games and then getting the little bonus for unlocking all of them in a group.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I loved this game on my Xoom before the OS was upgraded to Ice Cream Sandwich.  Now it won't even open.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it either opens to a black screen or, if I'm lucky, will get to the loading screen but never beyond that.  PopCap...fix this please!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|When this movie was released, I was not interested. In fact I was not going to go pay and see it but was invited by my dad to go with him and my nephews, and he'd pay. What the heck. I had nothing better to do that day. This wasn't going to be that good if good at all. It sure wasn't supposed to be. I saw it and...well...I had to applaud. It wasn't good. It was great! Excellent story and performances, especially by the focal point: Caesar. It was seemless. I was no Planet of the Apes connosieur but this was definitely great cinema worthy of purchase. What happened? Like X-Men First Class, this wasn't supposed to be good. You did it! You finally did it! Damn you! Damn you all to hell!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun but for all the work you do your energy doesn't last long. every thing else is good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Coming to this book from a position of having seen the movie first, I found both to be highly entertaining and enjoyable though I found Katniss to be a little more likable in the movie.<br /><br />I don't normally enjoy first-person narratives, finding they lack the immediacy and sense of peril that a well-written third-person can deliver, but the present-tense really helped ratchet up the tension nicely. It's an unconventional technique, but gives the impression that you're experiencing the events along with Katniss rather than hearing it from her later.<br /><br />Katniss is the quintessential survivor, pushing herself to do things she might not otherwise do to protect her family and the people she cares about. She's definitely a strong character and a far better role model than most for young girls in YA fiction. I really don't like her treatment of Peeta, but I it won't keep me from reading the other two books in the series.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|I was not impressed by this movie. Yet another 300-type attempt with a little Clash of the Titans, but it just didn't excite or intrigue me. The effects were very good, but nowadays effects are mostly good all the time, so I'm no longer in unbelieving awe. I still love great effects in movies, don't get me wrong, but it's the norm now. Now I need good acting and story and characters. This seemed to be made just to show off extreme violence with gods and titans. That's it. At the end I felt nothing. In my favorite movies I'm looking for something profound to remember and talk about, and a reason to come back. Did not get it here. These movies that have tried to imitate 300's effects method still fall short of that movie. However, I did like Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke's performances. This Zeus pissed me off though.
B003VANOFY|2.0|These are a great pair of headphones but the build quality and lack of good drivers really kill the product. My first pair stopped charging on me, so I RMA'd them, which was generally painless except the long wait time to receive my replacement pair. The replacements have now begun to crack. It seems I am not the only one who has this issue, as google has plenty of people talking about it too. It is a shame, because when they work, they are pretty good.
B0042816YK|4.0|This excellent movie begins as the Roberts character's life is falling apart after divorce so much so that she can not even enjoy the things she previously enjoyed food and love,and can not even be comforted by a teacher(being under the influence of teachers gurus or a theme here). This type of story was made in the 40's and later remade by bill murray(one of the best of modern comics)as Razor's edge(somerset maugham). This is  a different story based on a new book. The divorce shows the man looking for traditional values,stability,where as the woman flighty,seems to move among many relationships, a very commom feature of modern culture,normalized,as the animating romantic figures as our mind are looked for on the outside world rather than the other way around,or as the movie shows in terms of values. So where off to Italy,to a home with little running water,and none of the comforts science has brought to modern life,from here on the lack of typical comforts are important and the character muses in<br />anger 'jesus' as if in shock. She also changes perspectives,she is shown around an italian home situation, and around the city of naples,and the values are<br />'experienced' not authorized by the men,a theme in this movie. This is a similar theme of a man looking for values and stability in her earler film<br />mystic pizza. we also hear a great man,someone to look for,is someone who cares for children,but she also comments on the many good women shes talked too.<br />Then where off to India the land of 'bagavad giya.' Here we are seen the value of service in this religious culture,however it was in the west as well but never really taught. She feels disconnected..a texan who is briefly on the scene tells her you must master your mind...she has control isues...unspiritual and to the religious 'sick.' A typical modern man..Jesus' sermons can always be seen in this kind of controlling person. Using everyone for theor own ends....she needs to be transformed however shedoes get married...then off to bali single again...she meets a brazilian...i guess showing an american in<br />relation to people from different backgrounds. She doesnt want a husband...but healing,like the old shamans can perform. She is injured..bloody...and gets a medicine person offering this kind of service. She meets a brazilian who<br />represents the old portugueese,the wisdom of the west who was too disposed of<br />after caring for children,they both seek enlightenment a catch phrase in the west where after the decline of religion a new life was opening up...but here in its reverse format saving them from what science has brought the modern<br />world...the story ends showing her as someone who lost her balance in wayward<br />society and learning through traditional religion of east and west and finding wholeness and help...and she learns all  \\"given my experience\\"...and the film ends on a boat trip a phallic symbol of love...<br /><br />Julia roberts has brought a really grown up story to the screen and she really plays the role great! We are interested in her personal story and the tale is not lost in its myriad locations as we develop greater interest in her as the tale moves on...and we see the changes in the story. The director-writer may disagree and star on how i see their story,but its a story all too people have gone through all over the place..that's why everyone should see it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Well, personally, I consider the Bible the most important material possession I own.  So, it should come as no surprise that a good Bible app is of great use to me.  Actually, it does have more &quot;bells and whistles&quot; than I really need, but I'm sure all of them serve many people well.  I am disabled and spend much of my time in bed.  Therefore, the thing I like best is the wide selection of Bible versions yoy have with an audio option. My only wish is that you had an audible NASB version. I imagine though that you will add one in time.  Bottom line is that it is a five star app in my opinion, and I greatly thank you for it.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|As i see, the new 1.7.5 version is using an brand new platform called &quot;hiledou&quot;. It's a gaming company from China. It also bring those new permissons. They all senstive! Anyway, I won's install it to my phone til halfbrick announce something about this.

B004NYB1KM|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend who is a cat-lover. He put it together fairly quickly and absolutely loves it. You do have to be gentle with it because it can fall apart, but it's cute.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire begins with a soft start. It didn't really give that punch and run with it feeling like the Hunger Games had which is okay because sometimes to get to the interesting part of a story you have first to trek through the mud.<br /><br />(I would reveal some of the big moments, but for those that haven't read the sequel, I can't say much from here on out. I don't like spoiling good moments from books, especially the important ones.)<br /><br />It was interesting to see such a new dynamic placed out for Katniss with President Snow. That was the dark horse in the story. You could feel it everywhere, creeping around ever corner. His words had weight and it was keeping Katniss flat on her back in fear.<br /><br />When Peeta and Katniss reached the capitol, the idea of seeing Mockingjays everywhere being incorporated into the fashion of the citizens really took hold of a bigger message. It was quietly foreshadowing the last few chapters of the book. This is important, so if you aren't read it yet, keep your eyes out for this throughout the novel.<br /><br />Now for what happens in the 75th Hunger Games, I can say the arena in this book is quite interesting. The complex layout and ingenuity of it was genius on Collins part. I love the science aspect behind the construction the most. Definitely one of the cooler parts of the book and one I'm dying to see constructed for the movie! I can't say what it is and such and hoping they don't reveal anything in teasers or trailers for the movie later this year, but it's one to keep people on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />It was fun to read more humor being laid out in the book. I actually laughed out loud for some of it, where as with the Hunger Games, not so much. I can tell Collins was trying to balance out and diffuse any tension for the readers. I won't lie, it was dark and grim at certain parts of the book. It made the first book look like a walk in the park. All I have is one word: destruction. It was everywhere and every district was dealing with it<br /><br />Oh and I love how BOLD Peeta was in this novel. So good and eloquent too. He most certainly was sharp at pulling the rug out from everyone. Laying down some serious ground work for more & weaving a web of Katniss and Peeta's story of \\"love\\"... or so as they need to keep doing to prove to every district and the capitol.<br /><br />I do have to say, the way Katniss keeps describing her kisses with Peeta, it felt like she was falling in love with him or at least falling into lust from her intense physical feeling of burning passion she would get. At one point she didn't want to stop and couldn't get enough, kind of like two teenagers in love with the hand all over themselves groping.<br /><br />As for Gale and Katniss, it became increasingly clear of how confused Katniss was starting to feel for him and Peeta. She is still confused by the end of the book, so her decision will be finally made in Mockingjay. I'm very curious to see how that plays out.<br /><br />Overall, I've enjoyed the book. It is something worth reading if 1) you may not have enjoyed the first book or 2) need a new series to pick up and read. I'd highly recommend the first two books to read. And I normally don't endorse such a things!e and every district was dealing with it<br /><br />Oh and I love how BOLD Peeta was in this novel. So good and eloquent too.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Super Great.  I enjoyed this app/game fun to play looking forward to see more from the same people.  Game took me over a day to finish, looked great on the Kindle fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game. I play it often. It is great for winding down after a rough day at work. It is certainly worth a try. You have nothing to lose. its a free game.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|The movie was wonderfully reflective of that time, heart breaking and heart warming.  It displayed the strength of African American women, the indignities they suffered and the strength they gained and demonstrated.  It reminded us that everyone has courage and incredible strength, even though it is sometimes not obvious to the casual observer.  It also depicted the kindness of those who helped them throughout their journey.

B005D4Y522|5.0|It is clear to me that anyone who accuses Thielemann of being a dull in this Beethoven cycle has either not listened to the Allegro con brio of the first movement of the Second Symphony, or not listened properly, or has no ears to hear. To get the proper measure of this set, start there. It is one of the most joyous, released and sheerly infectious accounts I have ever heard, full of drive, impish wit and manic ecstasy. The orchestra is obviously having a high old time. As the DVD amply illustrates, they love playing for Thielemann and are clearly of the opinion that anyone who wants etiolated string-tone, vibrato-free whining and clipped phrasing can go and stick his head in a bucket. The fiddles of the Vienna Philharmonic slither around like a greased porker at a hog roast before easing into the ensuing Larghetto with the utmost suavity. It is equally apparent that the paying public seated in the splendidly named Goldener Saal der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde knows what it wants to hear, too - and they got it in this series of the complete symphonies recorded in numerical sequence between December 2008 and April 2010.<br /><br />I find it scandalously incomprehensible that the music critic of a major broadsheet should recently have complained that the clarity of these live recordings \\"only highlight[s] the swagger and occasional coarseness of the playing of the Vienna Philharmonic, confirming its status as the world's most overrated orchestra.\\" He is clearly in thrall to an entirely different musical aesthetic from the conductor, the orchestra, the audience and all those who have greeted these performances so enthusiastically. We really are at a cultural crossroads if such a glorious interpretation may be derided with impunity by a major commentator.<br /><br />Yet as the interviews in the accompanying DVD demonstrate, Thielemann is no recidivist dinosaur. He explains that he seeks to find an artistic direction which synthesises the virtues of the HIP movement with the Viennese tradition of interpreting Beethoven. He is thus, in a sense, an open-minded conservative. He rightly points out that by all accounts Beethoven wasn't a very good conductor, certainly never had at his disposal an orchestra like the VPO and was clearly unreliable when it came to those contentious metronome markings. It might well be that convicted HIPsters, on listening to these accounts, will conclude that Thielemann was only paying lip-service to the tenets of their creed but I am in no doubt regarding the sincerity of the conductor, his orchestra and his producers in their desire to honour Beethoven.<br /><br />So we certainly hear something which is much more indebted to the legacy of Karajan, Cluytens and Klemperer than to Norrington, Goodman or Hogwood, but there is a vibrancy, energy and freedom to Thielemann's which convey a special joie de vivre. Again, the rehearsal clips on the DVD confirm what an acute ear he has for sonic nuance, tonal balance and subtle phrasing; he is especially good at bringing out the lower voices and his agogic finessing, while not as overt or audacious as the now vanished manner of Furtw&auml;ngler, ensures an extraordinarily satisfying result.<br /><br />Nor are these performances by any means abnormally slow or marmoreal. To take a random sample from the middle period symphonies, comparing Thielemann's speeds with those of previous recordings from the canon of the accepted greats, we find that Thielemann is only as slow as Kleiber in the Allegro of the Fifth, virtually identical to Maag and Cluytens in the Sixth (except Cluytens doesn't make the repeats in the first movement), takes the Presto in the Seventh faster than Kubelik, Maag, Casals and Kleiber and maintains tempi in the Eighth virtually identical to those of Maag and Cluytens. It is true that HIP conductors are generally faster but one might equally point to Toscanini for an example of thrilling, driven propulsiveness, whereas such as Mackerras sound merely hasty. And there are times when you can hear Thielemann giving almost undue emphasis to the downbeat in every bar, so very few of the generalised accusations hold up under scrutiny. One disgruntled reviewer elsewhere complains that Thielemann's beat in the first movement of the Eroica is excessively slow yet has failed to acknowledge that he actually makes the exposition repeat unlike the supposedly superior version with which he is making comparisons supposedly invidious to Thielemann. It is another, different and possibly valid argument to object that taking the repeat unnecessarily prolongs and mars the progression of the movement, but for the most part too many carpers are hearing what they want to hear instead of examining the facts.<br /><br />For me, Thielemann's Beethoven sounds consistently fresh and exploratory infused with a genuine desire to rediscover the music as it is being played. This is a set ideally conceived to drive the wedge deeper between those who want the breathless, bright-eyed sparkiness of, say, Mackerras, and those who welcome what they regard as a return to sanity in the form of the great Romantic tradition of Beethoven interpretation. Thielemann plays to his clientele's tastes - not to mention his own and those of his orchestra.<br /><br />As the second essay in the booklet explains, the VPO's credentials for claiming \\"authenticity\\" in their style of Beethoven playing could hardly be stronger, for all that the \\"authenticists\\" excoriate their vibrato and ripe sound. The orchestra was specifically formed to play Beethoven and has done so since its first performance of the Seventh on Easter Monday 1842. Thielemann takes the orchestra's famed sonority and builds on it.<br /><br />These are performances all of a piece; Thielemann has imposed his conception upon the cycle as a whole and the emphasis upon weight and grandeur without excluding excitement. The Pastoral is typifies his approach: warm, lyrical and gently bucolic, redolent of a wise humanism closest to Cluytens rather than the bracing account Karajan delivers in his Moscow performance, yet the peasants' knees-up is sprightly and the storm powerful without ever becoming vulgar - and it builds to a terrific climax. The Fourth is as fine a reading as I have ever heard: the \\"cat-like tread\\" of its opening giving promise of a performance which ideally combines rigorous control with thrilling moments of release, especially in the finale. The Third and Fifth are monumental, although Thielemann pulls the tempo about daringly in the first movement of the \\"Eroica\\" and the finale of the \\"Fifth\\". The Seventh and Eighth are similarly grand in the Klemperer mode. Perhaps predictably, I found the Ninth the least satisfactory, mainly because of the strength of competition and the difficulty in finding modern soloists up to its vocal challenges. Having said that, it's really only the final movement that slightly disappoints: the soprano is the weak link, being rather wobbly and screaming her top B insecurely. Tenor Piotr Beczala has trouble finding the right pitch for his first entry on \\"Froh\\" and never sounds very comfortable but is adequate, as is the ever-restrained Fujimura. Georg Zeppenfeld is more baritone than bass but he has a firm, focused voice and declaims dramatically. The Singverein are lusty and committed, their penetration and intonation excellent. Otherwise, the other movements are titanic and I very much like the way Thielemann engineers a rallentando each time before the entry of the Ode, thereby generating real climactic punch.<br /><br />The recording quality is superb, although the wide dynamic range and Thielemann's insistence upon real pianissimos that undoubtedly carried in the hall present challenges to the engineers and hi-fi equipment. There is very little audience noise - the occasional cough but nothing disturbing and in quality this recording can stand comparison with any. The brass and hard-edged timpani come across with amazing clarity and immediacy but as I remarked earlier, the listener is always aware of the bottom-line harmonies.<br /><br />The packaging is de luxe: a handsome, off-white cloth-bound case and booklet, with white, purple and gold-stamped, embossed lettering, which has the unfortunate side-effect of making small-font information such as the catalogue number impossible to read. There are rather too many arty, hagiographic photographs of Thielemann reminiscent of the Karajan cult, and excellent essays on \\"Beethoven's Symphonies in an Age of Revolution\\" by author Tim Blanning and \\"Beethoven and the Formation of the Vienna Philharmonic\\" by Prof. Dr. Clemens Hellsberg, first violinist and president of the orchestra. The discs are contained in cardboard sleeves bound into the booklet. The voice-overs on the DVD documentary work well, except I wish someone had corrected the pronunciation of \\"timbre\\" so that it rhymes with \\"clamber\\" rather than perpetrating the solecism \\"tombre\\".<br /><br />You probably already know by now whether you are susceptible to the more Olympian interpretative stance adopted here by Thielemann and could hardly complain if you bought them expecting something more lean and lithe of the kind attempted - rather disastrously in my view - by Rattle with the same, I suspect, unwilling, orchestra in 2002. Thielemann has been quoted as seeking \\"to restore to the Classical and Romantic repertory the sort of musical riches and unprecedented expressivity that we associate with a conductor like Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler\\". In my judgement, he succeeds admirably without necessarily abandoning some of the lessons period practice has taught over the last generation; this is indeed \\"Beethoven for the Twenty-first Century\\".wise humanism closest to Cluytens rather than the bracing account Karajan delivers in his Moscow performance, yet the peasants' knees-up is sprightly and the storm powerful without ever becoming vulgar - and it builds to a terrific climax.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I originally bought the nostromo, and kept trying to \\"deal\\" with various shortcomings of it. Eventually I woke up, investigated the g13 and in truth it's the best gamepad. If you can undestand basic scripting you can make this device do exactly what you want due to an integrated scripting engine.<br /><br />Originally I wasn't sure I was going to use the LCD screen, however it's turned out to be useful for performance monitoring but more importantly controlling Pandora Radio.<br /><br />Overall I have no complaints about this device, It was a little awkward trying to access all of the buttons but I found my natural position fairly fast.<br /><br />Compared to Nostromo<br />--------------------<br />The Nostromo isn't scriptable (it has macros but that is it.)<br />The G13 offers a larger range of things each button can do<br />The G13 can have backlighting changed per memory bank and profile, it can also be controlled via scripts.<br />-- The above has been very important, in Starcraft II for example I have \\"Select Group\\" a white background, Add to group a Cyan color, and Replace/Overwrite group a Pinkish color. There is some on screen display I have programmed with this as well but the color allows me to quickly identify the state of the panel through my peripheral vision.<br />The G13's joystick is a joystick, the Nostromo is a thumbpad on a d-pad<br />The G13 has more buttons readily available<br />The Nostromo has more memory banks, this originally sold me but turned out to be very cumbersome to work with.<br />The G13 can store profiles on the device which stores very fast. This is important to note because I also have a Razer Imperator which requires the longest write times on the smallest changes to the device.<br />The G13 (in my opinion) has a more natural curve for my hand, the Nostromo was too drastic and actually led to carpal tunnel-esque pains.<br /><br />The Nostromo is still a good device but given the relatively tiny price difference between the G13and Nostromo, the G13 wins hands down.

B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I originally wanted to miss out on this fad, but was convinced by a friend to read the books. Yes, they were gripping, but I also found myself vaguely repulsed, and I finished the trilogy with mixed feelings, and a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />To me, the story was basically an updated version of the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur. King Midas has a baby, which has the head of a bull and an appetite for human flesh. In order to contain it, he has Daedelas build a giant maze-- the Labyrinth-- under his castle. To feed it, a bunch of kids are sent in Tribute (sound familiar?) to Midas by the countries he's conquered. Then they're left to fend for themselves. To me, the book's plotline stuck with the Theseus myth to a T, with some new elements thrown in for variety. About the only things that changed were the gender and social class of the hero (Theseus was the son of a king).<br /><br />This book might have been more believable if it were adults instead of kids. That bit, it seems, was put in to appeal to the younger audience, and possibly to make our old friends at Bread look more sinister (they strike at our most vulnerable!). When I heard &#34;YA novel&#34;, I immediately got an idea of what it was about-- plucky teenagers overcoming immense obstacles to, as Schultz says in &#34;The Great Dictator&#34;: &#34;win the day! Heh heh!&#34;<br /><br />And it was. Although the basic &#34;plucky teenager&#34; plot was muddled up a bit to appear thought-provoking and relevant, it stayed true to that premise. No actual adults need apply. Plucky teenager can (and is forced to) do it all on her own.<br /><br />The casual brutality of the book also annoyed me. Yes, war is war, and I enjoy military fiction, but watching teenagers slaughter each other was repulsive. This book was meant to be entertainment. Is this what entertains us now? Though others described the book as thought-provoking, my only thought after finishing the trilogy was this (undoubtably, what many others think as well): by presenting a book about teenagers killing each other for entertainment AS entertainment, this book is a product of the very society it tries so ham-fistedly to satire. And that's a chilling thought.<br /><br />To sum up: if you want an actual, thought-provoking comment on modern society and our war-and-violence obsessed culture, check out the works of Robert Littell. For a well-written satire about how superficial we are rapidly becoming, try Scott Westerfield on for size. If you want a flashy, trashy throwaway generic teen novel that tries and fails to combine the two: you've come to the right place.<br /><br />2.5 for some redeeming moments. Kama ro'a efshar livlo'a? Seems like a heckuva lot, these days.
1451673442|4.0|I never thought that I would be into this type of thing but I purchased an audio book of the Secret at a garage sale for $1.00 After listening to it I was very much captivated by what I heard and have been sharing it with many of my friends and loved ones. My next step was to purchase the Magic and I have only just begun to read the book. So far I believe that it was a good purchase, (even if I paid full price) ha ha

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you liked the books then you'll love the show. Never read the books? You'll still love it. The series is very well done. The crew replicated a perfect medieval/fantasy-type atmosphere with immaculate locations, sets, costumes/armor, weapons and special effects. Great actors (children included). The series stays true to the book on which it was based. I'm looking forward to many more seasons based off of the other books in the series.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This show is incredibly casted, produced, written and its very accurately based on the best book series. You won't find a better show.
B000LE0TGA|3.0|Let me qualify myself here-I am a HUGE ELO fan, an audio engineer (because of ELO's influence I wanted to learn how to make records), and have had the honor of meeting and discussing music with Jeff Lynne for hours once at a Hollywood actors party where we were the only two music people there with our girlfriends. (though calling me a \\"music person\\" next to Jeff Lynne is like calling me a guitar player next to Eric Clapton, but I digress) Like most American ELO fans, Out of the Blue was a touchstone moment in my 16 year old life-by 1977 disco had almost taken over, The Cars were just breaking, Elton had gone off the deep end with Blue Moves, and though we'd heard of Punk in NE Ohio we'd also heard of Tom Petty, and that was where we leaned towards to get our rock n roll. My like-minded friends and I REALLY hoped that after New World Record the next ELO record wasn't Blue Moves II. And it wasn't. To this day I still listen to tracks from this record and if I let them, tears of joy will come to my face. I'm in awe of what this record meant to me then and now. When I heard Jeff had produced the upcoming new Joe Walsh CD I dove back into ELO and saw the 30th Anniversary reissue with bonus tracks and clicked the next day shipping.<br /><br />Sadly, it's a real disappointment. Although I'm glad to hear anything new and different about this record (I wish they's have done one of those Eagle Rock Classic Album DVD's about this or ANY ELO record!), the sonic quality is actually worse than the Joe Gastwirt remaster-it is instantly noticable-especially on MP3 where (sadly) current generations will go to get it. I loaded both CD's into iTunes and A/B'd several tracks. I also dumped both into ProTools HD3 at my studio and monitored thru a $300K SSL and $30K Genelics. Not to get all gear snobby here-as I said these differences are even MORE noticable on iTunes through a $200 set of computer speakers. There's a dullness to Jeff's signature 12-string throughout, the strings as another review mentioned are now non-descript and moved back, and the bass is vague. The earlier CD version is a bit digitally crispy (it was the 90's), but the disc is tighter, punchier, and the hi-hat just seems more locked in especially on the \\"hits\\" like \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" and \\"Sweet is the Night\\". the 30th is not noticably LOUDER than the old version, but it is slightly measurable in the studio. Also, the track start and stop times are at different points on each version, which is neither hear nor there, and if Jeff picked them for the 30th then that's where they're supposed to be and they were wrong all along. But the sound is something different, as this re-issue is noticably different than the Flashback Box Set and other bonus track ELO reissues I've bought as well.<br /><br />It's worth it for the bonus tracks alone to us big fans, but don't throw away the Gastwirt CD, OR your vinyl! Lastly, this Amazon version advertised as \\"with book\\", is not.  There is a few page normal insert that doesn't go too deep info-wise; more info than is here is available on the ELO.biz website.
1451673442|5.0|What I like about this book...one of the things...is it gives step by step directions which is something Byrne hasn't done in her other books.  I'm a person who really benefits from clear directionsByrne has done a wonderful job of presenting well researched information in a user friendly form.  And if you don't buy what she has to say, try reading The Power of Positive Thinking or Think and Grow Rich and you'll find more proof of the laws of the universe just in different terms.
0345803485|2.0|Pros:  Easy to read, if a bit boring at times.  I can see how this would be construed as mommy porn because the sexual scenes are pervasive but not incredibly explicit.  Good cliffhanger at the end, and although I didn't care for the book, I wanted to read the next one to see what would happen between Christian and Ana.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert** I think there is a lot of potential in this had the author had more time/experience/good editors.  The whole idea of a damaged dom teaching an inexperienced sub while both of them had vanilla feelings for each other could be a great basis for a novel, unfortunately I didn't feel that this was exploited enough in the actual book. **end spoiler**<br /><br />Cons:  It's fan-fiction.  I can see glimpses of the Twilight character outlines (dominant male, submissive female, beauty, power, etc.), and I actually think that takes away from the storyline because this was written for adults.  Teens handle flat characters fairly easily, but I expect something more.I'd have loved to learn more about \\"the scene\\" . . . I felt that kind of background was lacking.<br /><br />Summary:  Quick, erotic read that you can breeze through in a weekend.  Don't expect too much - it's just a fan-fiction romance novel - and that's the entire plot. As someone who has read the Twilight books, the comparison between the two lies only in the archetypes of the characters and the basic plot of mutual fascination between the main characters.

B00005JM02|4.0|The screenplay for Finding Nemo is very, very clever and its one of those films you can watch multiple times and pick up something new each time.  The basic story <no spoilers> is about the coming of age of a clown fish named Nemo.  And, as the name implies, Nemo's dad spends a lot of time looking for him.<br /><br />Love her, hate her, but any way you cut it Ellen DeGeneres turns in a brilliant performance as Dory, the memory challenged companion of Nemo.  Likewise Willem Defoe is a standout as Gill, the escape artist.  Add to these Bruce, the rehab shark, and Crush the very mellow surfer turtle and you've got a tour de force.<br /><br />The screenplay is so clever that you really have to listen closely to get the full effect.  And even when you're watching it again, the humor still works.  The only downside that you have to deal with is the rather Disney-ish tendency to portray children as the wise ones and adults as the louts.  This isn't done in such a heavy handed way though that it ruins the storyline.<br /><br />Should you buy it?  If you've got young kids and you've never seen it before, I'd definitely say yes.  It's virtually guaranteed that you'll watch it several times.  Pixar generally turns out great films and this is certainly one of the better ones.  It's geared for kids but adults will enjoy it as well.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|i barley got this thing shipped to me today and i already love it. very rear because i dont usually get satisfiesd with products that easly.if u own a windows 7 laptop computer and you share networks with your neighbor who lives about 18 ft away, this product is for you. just follow the instructions on the manual and boom!! there you go. enjoy fast internet with better signal and no more waiting for youtube videos to take forever to load.  oh and 1 impotant thing i think u should kno, the only down side on this thing is that it only works with 1 laptop or computer. your ipod , ipad , smart phones etc wont get better signal out of this thing. if u are looking for something like that then what u need is a wifi repeater or range extender. hope this review was helpful.
B0041VV03A|4.0|I've a feeling, that some, like me, are going to watch this twice.  It sort of sneaks up on you, science fiction at it's greatest is always able to do this, for me: make the world they're creating, real to me, make it all believable ... make it all cohere, and then slip in 'the idea.'<br /><br />They have brought forth this 'creature.'  Sort of a lab rat, only human DNA...all makes sense, and they do it so well, mostly because they don' *over* do it, the creature is about what I imagine would come about.  What got me all twisted tho, was that the creature seemed female, and got sexier and sexier, to where I was kind of turned on by 'it.'  I didn't feel *too* weird tho, since Adrean Brody was too...<br /><br />But aside from all that silliness: it was a good movie, hard to predict, and it got spooky towards the end...I enjoyed it. :)

0393338959|1.0|[[ASIN:0393338959 Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy]]This book is 343 pages of pure torture.  It reads like something written by an exceptionally immature teenager.  Stiglitz just repeats himself over and over like a broken record and doesn't provide one single insight in this entire book.<br /><br />He repeatedly claims, ad nauseam, that the financial crisis of 2008 can be blamed on a \\"deregulatory frenzy of the 1980s\\" that \\"stripped away regulations\\".  He doesn't bother to name these imaginary regulations that were supposedly stripped since they never existed in the first place.  Apparently, he believes that if you repeat a lie 62,400 times, it becomes the truth.<br /><br />There is one exception where he actually does name a law that was repealed.  According to Stiglitz, the repeal of Glass-Steagall (by Clinton), which had separated investment & commercial banks, created ever larger banks that were too big to fail.  If deregulators had just kept commercial banking separate from investment banking none of this would have happened.  According to this myth, allowing them to combine caused the problem which would naturally mean that separating them is the solution.  The exact opposite happened.  At the time of the crisis Lehman Brothers (an investment bank) was NOT involved in commercial banking.  Neither was Bear Stearns.  Neither was Merrill Lynch.  Neither was Goldman Sachs, so his point is NOT supported by the facts.  Notice that the regulators SOLUTION to the crisis was to combine stand-alone investment banks like Bear Stearns & Merrill Lynch with commercial banks like JP Morgan Chase & Bank of America.  The regulators decision to allow Goldman Sachs to get involved in commercial banking was seen as a solution to the crisis, not a cause of it.  He has a remarkable ability to cite facts that completely demolish his argument, yet somehow he walks away from it thinking that they support his argument.<br /><br />People like Stiglitz dream of a fascist world where \\"the elites\\" such as himself control every aspect of your life.  Who does this guy think he is when he states, \\"Owning a piece of land does not give you the right to burn leaves that might pollute the air.\\"?  In that case, if he were dictator of the world he would certainly take away your right to burn firewood to stay warm or roast marshmallows on a campfire for that matter.<br /><br />Buy this book & take a glimpse into the mind of a mentally ill person who once held a cabinet position during the Clinton Administration.  You'll quickly understand why this country is on the road to economic ruin.  Stiglitz's Nobel Prize in Economics makes about as much sense as Muammar Gaddafi's Nobel Peace Prize nomination.
0316017930|5.0|Outliers changed the way I look at success.  Before I read the book I believed success was driven in large part by hard work and innate ability.  I now know that model is far too simplistic.  I now believe success is the result of those factors in addition to a myriad of other factors many of which may be unseen.<br /><br />Gladwell's writing style is fast paced and fun to read.  The Mathew Effect and The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes are particularly good and are my two favorite chapters in book.  Both are informative, captivating, and changed the way I look at the world.
B006TGWY3K|4.0|I really hope that Shallow Life will forever be Lacuna Coil's \\"St. Anger\\" if you know what I mean. So far, that is easily the band's lowest point.<br /><br />Shallow Life has a much darker, sinister tone to it, which I oh so dearly love! They've resisted the temptation to continue traveling that bright, shiny road to mainstream exposure plus endless retirement funds and given their most loyal fans what they wanted instead, or so it seems. For the record, I'm not a \\"loyal fan\\"- I had pretty much given up on the band entirely until I saw the price tag of $5.00 to download. In fact, I hadn't even bothered to preview the tracks until I saw that price. I'm glad they did that. The return to their roots surprised me quite a bit, and not only that, even though it's a bit of a throwback, it still sounds unique, not mimicking everything they've done in the past. It's its own album.<br /><br />But there are some things that do annoy me about it. The main one being the cover of \\"Losing my Religion\\", which is nothing but filler in my eyes. Replace it with an original song and the album would be better. I hate hearing covers of songs that I've heard infinity times, regardless of how good they are. In fact, leave them off the album completely, and it wouldn't matter to me. Better yet, why not make the cover the bonus song instead? Since the bonus song is left out of this version, people aren't going to care or criticize as much if it was a poor cover we were being CHEATED out of. That's my main gripe, or two that go hand-in-hand I suppose.<br />The rest are minor, taste-related things such as Andrea Ferro having too much lead vocals, Cristina's new, odd vocal delivery on some songs (they sound a little \\"Disney\\" in some parts, and I hate how her voice has changed), the fact that most of the songs are the same length and that the instrumentals are not given the spotlight enough.<br /><br />But overall, the album is quite successful in doing what I personally wanted the band to do, so I will surely be listening to it for a while. With the exception of the R.E.M. cover, all of the songs are pretty good, especially \\"My Spirit\\", which is easily the darkest-sounding song on the album. I also like \\"Give Me Something More\\", which has a nu-metal sound to it, a type of sound I think they pull off EXTREMELY well; better than most nu-metal bands for that matter. \\"End of Time\\" has an example of Cristina sounding a bit too \\"Disney\\" (at around 2:40), but I love how the song sounds: heavy and heavy-hearted, and even Ferro sounds great in this one.<br /><br />I hope Lacuna Coil keeps making music like this, hopefully in a more progressive manner. For future releases, they reeeeeeeally need to give the light to other members of the band besides the drummer, who plays excellently on most of their songs. The guitarist should play more than just riffs. Interestingly, Marco Zelati doesn't give his own parts (bass and keyboard) enough glory even though he's the primary songwriter (according to Wikipedia). The album is good, but a great album does not force most of the attention on one part.o I will surely be listening to it for a while.

1250004217|5.0|What a moving and well-written book.  The way the story moves between time periods was very well done, and then it merges into a single time period.  I read it in an evening and am recommending it to friends.
0393340244|1.0|Fine is an excellent writer. She certainly has talent. But she might do better at fiction which is what this book really amounts to. From the very beginning of the book there are all the evident signs of someone on a mission to \\"prove\\" their own personal perspective. While I'm not a scientist, as a social worker and educator I have a keen interest in behavioral and gender issues. I've spent years reviewing the research and attending seminars related to this subject. Fine's speculations, or perhaps we should call it what it is, wishful thinking, simply do not jive with what I have learned academically or with my many years of experience working with individuals and groups. And she presents nothing in this book that gives me cause to doubt my own experience or what I have learned from the available research in this area. Fine has neither made a genuinely empirical study of gender nor has she given us an honest, unbiased interpretation of others research. I honestly think that those people giving this book four and five stars are people simply gushing with joy at being told exactly what they want to hear.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I think it's great.  It's exactly what I was looking for (and what's it's advertised to be)--thin, lightweight, and protective.  Really nice and thin, like it hardly adds any additional bulk, which I love.  I used to have a different cover, and it was just too thick and ugly.  Yes, it's not a huge, thick cover, but it's not supposed to be--it's supposed to be thin and light--which it is.  It is, without a doubt, better than leaving it bare, and if you are really going to jostle it around a lot, it's common sense that you'd put it in a thicker padded case.  The versitility is nice; I like that I can throw it in my purse when I need to.  I've had it for about 3 weeks so far, and I also haven't experienced the white cover getting dirty like a lot of people have.  I use it daily, but when I'm going to and from work I put it in a padded case in my backpack, but I carry it all over the place at home and at the gym and have yet to see it get all gross.  Bottom line: attractive, functional, the rubberized coating feels cool, and does what it's supposed to do.  It's a great product in my opinion.
0439023483|3.0|I found the story line to be engaging.  It was a hard book to put down, but there were several points that detracted from the overall effect.  The science fiction, in terms of economics and technology was ill conceived.  It just wasn't well thought out.  The reader must close his eyes to the conclusion that the social and economic system simply could not work.  There is no where near enough economic mass in the North Korea-like Districts to support the parasitic capitol.  The magic technology of the Capital is improbable in the extreme.<br /><br />Collins really had no idea what a bow and arrows are, how they are used, or what they are capable of.  They were such a critical item to Katniss' whole being, that this is inexcusable.  She should have spent a few hours on the range with a competent instructor.  Then she would have sounded like she had a clue.<br /><br />The penultimate scene was ludicrous (But no spoilers here.) but the final scene and the post games tension was well executed.<br /><br />It is a book written for 16 year olds.

I admire Loreena's many talents so much & now apparently she can also produce her own dvd, & do it really well.

0307887898|5.0|Although I was a bit reluctant at first to buy the book because I had the impression from all the communication around the concept that it must be one of these passing managerial fads, I must say I have been favorably surprised by the depth of the book's insights about the future of organizations.

It is about the challenge of organizations in a much more uncertain world, and how to be successful through the application of a method. Great book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|In this second installment, the journey continues with the celebration of the Hunger Games' seventy-fifth anniversary, but with much more horrifically appalling events taking place. Surprisingly, the contenders for this year events are no strangers to the game, which is a tragedy in itself.  But it's the Capitol's President Snow who seeks retribution for what occurred in the previous game and he's the one who sets the rules. So it's no surprise that the events in this story are unpredictably horrifying. At the same time, the previous years' events sparked unrest amongst the District's citizens and it can be felt throughout. So much so, that the President Snow grows more violent in his actions and decisions.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, President Snow blames the insurgency on Katniss for her rebellious berry-eating stunt she pulled in the previous games. In this episode, he has threatened her by annihilating all those closest to her if she did not suppress and halt the uprising by convincing the audience how much she loves Peeta . For you see, Katniss is now looked upon by the citizens as the revolutionary trailblazer for the people, and the \\"Mockingjay\\" symbol as hope for change. And so the games begin, along with all the turmoil, tragedies, and devastating, dark days that await the transformation of current-day civilization.<br /><br />In this book, many new characters are introduced; all previous winners of the games.  One of importance is Finnick who will be a key player in the games. Gale is not presented as much in this book but he does have an essential role as the adventure continues in the final book. As for Peeta, his character has become more charismatic and fierce and he has grown more dynamic--to the point that you know he will be the key source for the outcome of the revolution. Katniss has so many crossroads, and whichever road she chooses, it will have a lasting effect on the current human life and civilization. Her character has come a long way and she will always fight to the bitter end.<br /><br />This book is truly a brilliant transition for the finale of the Hunger Games; couple that with all the profound characters and the extraordinary foundation of the story, and you have one remarkable adventure...just an overall overwhelming read! Highly Recommend!ll always fight to the bitter end.<br /><br />This book is truly a brilliant transition for the finale of the Hunger Games; couple that with all the profound characters and the extraordinary foundation of the story, and you have one remarkable adventure...just an overall overwhelming read!

1400052181|5.0|I was a a little hesitant when my book club suggested this book. I thought it might be really dry, with a lot of complex information on cells that would take a while to understand. That was not the case, it was extremely readable, everything was clearly explained. The story was really about what happened to Henrietta and her family.I couldn't put it down. It really makes you think about the human implications of scientific research.

1451648537|5.0|It's interesting to compare this biography of Steve Jobs with the previous book I read, _In The Plex_ which is essentially a biography of Google. While the drive at Google seems to be rigorous intellectual pursuits of the impossible, the drive at Apple was the pursuit of perfection.<br /><br />And this book is as much about Apple as it is about Steve Jobs. While it does cover his personal life, there really isn't that much of it. Jobs, by his own admission spent less time on his children than he did on his work.<br /><br />Isaacson does a good job of portraying both the brilliant drive that Jobs had and also his remarkably bratty personal side. From his earliest years he appears to have been convinced that he was simply cleverer and more important than everyone else. His actions were consistently selfish and inconsiderate of all around him. As a human being he fails again and again.<br /><br />And yet. His accomplishments can't be ignored. They are many and remarkable. His obsession with perfection resulted in products that no one else will likely ever replicate.<br /><br />I was already familiar with his early years at Apple, but the inside perspectives on the alter years were interesting and showed that it wasn't really maturing that allowed Jobs to hit his creative peak with the iPhone and iPad, but rather the fact that he finally surrounded himself with a group of people who were both equally talented in their own areas of expertise, not overwhelmed by Jobs and able to get a little respect out of him.<br /><br />In the end it's a sad story. His own hubris and refusal to accept reality (traits that had served him well over the years) were his final undoing.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game it is fun because you don't have to keep on getting games at the app store you can just get this game and play lots of games that is why it is called 101 games and even plus 23 games Witch  really is 124 games cool right!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002VSN|5.0|I like this so much, every song is a winner & will touch your heart. I gave one copy to a friend who was having a very trying time in her life & she later told me it was such a help to her. Whitney Houston's voice can be so powerful and vibrant or soothing and warm. Unbelievable!<br />(I just wish the photo on the cover was better. It doesn't do her justice.)
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is a cool mixture of my country and sports edition both are good games that makes this game perfect.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|We saw this film when it was first released & enjoyed it immensely. I don't know why we didn't have it on DVD in our film library---I guess I thought Ms. Houston would go on forever. So much talent unfulfilled. She was so influential to others who tried to copy her singing style but always fell short. She brought excitement, joy, and exuberance to every performance and her audience loved her for it. There will not be another like her.
B007I7GGCE|5.0|k dont let peple fool you when they say its all pop cause about 12 are rap and some have rap pieces  in them i think its a very great album for a boy or girl everything is not gonna click if she just raps all the time its not her shes diverse shez also been singing since mixtape.. days youtube these still i rise.. can anybody hear me..... ect it goes. on dont try to knock her for pop it was all her dream to do pop even said it  in interviews  and if your that unclear about it ur not a nicki minaj fan so dont knock it because ur a all day rap person because  some people love mixed music so i think you should buyy..it. i gave it a 5 cause when itz not even playing i randomly  start singing it and wanna hear it very addictive... btw
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Quite simply this is the definition of a can't miss television show. Breaking Bad has the perfect balance of comedy and drama, without becomming a dramedy relic like Dawson's Creek. Breaking Bad follows cancer stricken Walt as he continues to support his family, albeit without their knowledge, by cooking meth. Brian Cranston is remarkable as the science teacher turned genius meth chemist, Giancarlo Espisito plays a great sociopathic fast food entrepeneur/drug kingpin and Bob Odenkirk is absolutely perfect as sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman. Season one was great, but season two was even better. If you're not sure whether or not this show's for you, quite thinking and start watching. Amazing.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|While it is often hailed as being \\"the next Twilight\\", Collins' dystopian trilogy is much deeper, and frankly much better written.  We follow Katniss, a young girl from a poor family, as she competes in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death, and becomes a revolutionary figure in the fight against the corrupt government of her country.  Although I thought that the books got progressively weaker, with the third installment, Mockingjay, being too focused on a love triangle between Katniss and two of her friends, the trilogy still makes for entertaining reading for both teenagers and adults.<br /><br />As for the Kindle version of the trilogy specifically, I found a couple points where the font size would change partway through a page without reason.  Whether this is just a glitch in my reader (iPad) or within the coding of the book I don't know, but it was a minor distraction.<br /><br />Overall a worthwhile purchase, especially for the price.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Yes, let's just go back to believing all the financial advisers due to their degree's - that it is too complicated for us mere mortals to understand...or watch this and pull the blinders off. I'll give you one guess what I did. Should be required viewing for those going into any finance career. When we will care more about doing the right thing than making money? Oh silly me, what a dreamer I am...
B0054JZC6E|2.0|found mysterious frickin ad on the state bar - that is excruciatingly annoying!!  as if I would actually download or buy anything it advertised !!! puhleez wtf<br /><br />a true shame BC this is a great app otherwise.  a vastly wide variety of fairly difficult arcade mini games that aren't mastered in one or two tries. JUST challenging enough to make you want to keep trying.  you are awarded with extra points too for persistence which helps you unlock other games (good if you just can't master one or don't like it or just want more variety.<br /><br />if someone can find a less intrusive or scheming (trickery) to advertise, you can make a million by gathering these types of mini games. hell, I might do that myself. LOL

B002RKRV4Y|5.0|I was very satisfied with my purchased. This book is very enlightening and I fully recommend it to other readers.
1451648537|5.0|Well written bio. There are many interesting facts. Watch the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley. Very similiar story although not as detailed as the book. If you are interested in Apple or Steve Jobs, you will like this book. I despise Apple and will never buy their products but the book is good. The book reiterates why I could never buy Apple. Interesting read for sure.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a great book that I read as a follow-up to the recently released \\"Willpower\\".  It addresses the prevalence of habits in our lives and how we may better control our lives by identifying and shaping said habits.  There is a good mix of anecdotal and scientific evidence which makes for an informative and easy read.  I especially enjoy how the author continually makes use of the Habit Loop construct (Cue, Routine, Reward; all driven by a Craving) to demonstrate the mechanics behind the specific examples used in the book.  The continually use of this simple construct enforces it wide applicability and enables me to begin using it when addressing my own habits.  Unlike some behavioral psych books which contain some good factoids but not much applicability, this book is almost a text for how to control the all important habits which define our lives.

B003LR5BD0|4.0|This is a taut, clever thriller where the detective plays cat and mouse with the criminal and vice versa. I would give it five stars but for the photography: a number of the scenes are shot with the camera unsteady--something that irritates me no end--and the narrative is occasionally interrupted with one-second totally blurry representations of the crime. (This is so gratuitous and irritating I am tempted to penalize it to THREE stars.)
B005K17RU0|4.0|Have had my Fire since November and had this app at least 4 months. No problems others have encountered. have a ton of apps running.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Search and note functions are nicely user friendly. Unfortunately, Revised Standard Version seems unavailable. It would make the app much more useful if one could import devotional plans or the Liturgical readings for each day. Clearly, this app was designed for non-Liturgical, most llikely conservative sort of Christian view.
0439023521|5.0|This book was a page turner and I thought it was clean and well written.  I am so tired of the smut and filth out there (like 50 shades) and although there was some violence it was a good read and well written.  Good Job Susanne!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|\\"War Horse\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: A friendship begins between a horse named Joey and a young man called Albert, who tames and trains him. When they are forcefully parted, the horse moves through the First World War, changing and inspiring the lives of all those he meets -- British cavalry, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter.<br /><br />The cast led by Emily Watson (as Rose Narracott), Peter Mullan (as Ted Narracott) & Jeremy Irvine (as Albert Narracott) is brilliant. The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (based on Michael Morpurgo's novel & the play) by Richard Curtis & Lee Hall is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by John Williams is brilliant. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is brilliant. The film editing by Michael Kahn is brilliant. The casting by Jina Jay is brilliant. The production design by Rick Carter is brilliant. The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow, Alastair Bullock, Molly Hughes, Kevin Jenkins, Neil Lamont & Gary Tomkins is brilliant. The set decoration by Lee Sandales is brilliant. The costume design by Joanna Johnston is brilliant. The make-up design by Lois Burwell is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Ben Morris & the special effects supervised by Neil Corbould is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a beautifully, well-crafted and well-made film that is also well-paced and emotionally well-acted. This is also a different film that nobody has done or seen in a while, different even for Spielberg, which is brilliant. This is also a film that will keep you entertained after the movie ends. This is one of the best films of last year (of the Christmas holiday season, as well) and of Spielberg's resume.

B000002LGQ|4.0|It's been over twenty years since I've listened to Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" album and I've always been baffled by those who regarded it as one of her best works. At the time of its' release I failed to be as instantly captivated by this effort as I had been by \\"Madonna\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\". Back in '89, I was expecting some bouncy, get-up-on-the-dance-floor fare like \\"Spotlight\\" or \\"Causing a Commotion\\" and what I got were Disney-esque fairy tales about pink elephants and lemonade, and sombre odes to Spanish soldiers. Needless to say, after a few spins I was not pleased and tucked this one away for decades. In the wake of the disappointing \\"MDNA\\", I have been revisiting Lady M's back catalogue, and in hindsight \\"Like a Prayer\\" is a darn good album and the first point in her career where Madonna truly showed growth and maturity. Most of the album feels like a personal catharsis for Madonna as she draws on her own human experience to craft personal, heartfelt, poignant yet catchy songs inspired by the loss of her mother, her father's indifference and a turbulent marriage, as well as her conflicting feelings about religion.<br /><br />The original versions of \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" are textbook examples of how to make dance music the old-fashioned way without synths or technical assistance. \\"Keep\\" comes off especially funky here compared to the \\"Soul II Soul\\"-radio remix that came later. \\"Express Yourself\\" still sounds great though I do admit to loving the bass-driven dance version found on \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" most of all. The percolating keyboards that appeared on \\"Live to Tell\\" are sped-up to underscore the boppy yet moody spousal-abuse tale \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\" and the hypnotic beats of the Prince duet \\"Love Song\\" will ricochet off your brain. \\"Dear Jessie\\" ALMOST veers into Kate Bush territory had the lyrics been less saccharine, and \\"Cherish\\" is just a breezy take on the '60s girl-group sound that continues where \\"True Blue\\" (the single) left off. The most haunting and powerful moments, of course come in a pair of introspective piano cuts dealing with Madonna's feelings of loss, denial then acceptance and empowerment regarding her parents in \\"Promise to Try\\" and \\"Oh Father\\"--definitely her most raw and personal material to date. The feedback-laden \\"Act of Contrition\\" is an annoying throwaway that should have been scrapped and included only as the B-Side of one of the many 12\\" singles.<br /><br />Like a Prayer 5/5<br />Express Yourself 5/5<br />Love Song 4/5<br />Til Death Do Us Part 5/5<br />Promise To Try 5/5<br />Cherish 4/5<br />Dear Jessie 4/5<br />Oh Father 5/5<br />Pray For Spanish Eyes 3/5<br />Act of Contrition 1/5<br /><br />Of Madonna's '80s output, \\"Like a Prayer\\" seems to have aged the best, though \\"Like a Virgin\\" is still my favorite album of hers from that decade. If you dismissed this album years ago as I did, try listening to it from a fresh perspective--you'll hear what you may have missed the first time--one of Madonna's most honest and personal contributions to her huge legacy.le) left off.

B0071WQ7WU|3.0|Let me get this out of the way - I am a Shinedown fan.  I have been since their first release, so as I went to pick up Amaryllis I admittedly had high hopes.  After enjoying most of their albums, I put Amaryllis in and felt an immediate let down.  What was once meaningful powerful hard rock, has turned into a stale reproduction of the daily grind in the business.  Amaryllis dreams big, but wakes up before the good part.<br /><br />The lead single \\"Bully\\" sounds like a rushed demo, put out to meet a single deadline from the record label.  Lyrical themes are heavy, but their content seem childish and amateur at best. While Shinedown has proven themselves as talented songwriters, all the songs on this album show a sign of complacency.  Uninspired guitar riffs with stock drums create a feeling of dread as tracks change.  Nothing on this album sounds enthused, and it left me with a sense of \\"Where did Shinedown go?\\"<br /><br />All in all this is a short review because frankly, I expected much more.  I would not buy this album, it is a casual listen when you don't really want to feel or think anything.  Solid playing, but the content leaves too much to be desired.  Shinedowns' worst attempt yet.

B006INDMEE|2.0|The debt must be paid, but the price for watching it was just a little bit too high?  This is a story that needed to be told, to someone who can't live past the holocaust.  Just be glad that Nazi Germany is gone, and that you don't have to relive it by watching this movie.
0811870413|5.0|I started baking bread for the first time in the fall of 2011 and I instantly became obsessed with the smell, texture, and taste of real homemade bread.  My teenage daughter bought me Tartine Bread as a birthday gift in October not knowing how complex and involved Chad Robertson's process is for making true sourdough bread.<br /><br />At first I didn't want to try because I was an amateur and intimidated.  After my daughter kept asking me if I was going to make the Tartine sourdough bread I relented.  Much to my surprise, the recipe yielded the best sourdough bread I have ever tasted.  Yes, better than what you can get buy on the left coast.<br /><br />Key Points:<br />This bread takes a lot of time to make so schedule accordingly.  I like to make it on bad weather days here in New England or during TV sporting events.  There is a lot of dough rising time.<br />Making the starter takes about 5 days but keep it \\"fed\\" and you won't have to make it again.  It's easy and is actually like a fun science experiment.  The starter is required to make the bread recipe.<br />The start to finish time for making a loaf is about 12 hours but that includes 4 hours of bulk fermentation and 4 hours of final rise. Lots of waiting around.  Note, you can do the bulk fermentation over night and then save a lot of time the next day for the shaping and final rise.<br />You will need some tools:  steel dough scraper, cast iron dutch oven, electronic kitchen scale, and electric knife.  They are extremely important.  The recipes don't use standard volume measures such as cups and tablespoons; they use metric weights (grams).  Don't be intimidated!  Most scales have metric conversions.  It's actually easier once you start!  I use the electric knife instead of the suggested razor blade contraption in the book for scoring the loaf in a hot dutch oven.<br /><br />That's it!  Just follow the recipe as best as you can.  I fully expected to fail the first time I tried but the bread came out perfectly!<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is Robertson can be wordy. It would be great if he summarized the country loaf recipe in a one pager after his long description.

B005LAIH9K|5.0|So, it has been years since the last release in the series, or at least what I recognize as the last release in the series(american wedding), and after all of the hoping, wishing & praying, I finally got my wish! Just saw the new movie yesterday(opening day release).<br /><br />Let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed American Reunion!<br />What a story! A group of PALS that go through good times & bad times with Each Other & always are there for each other.<br />Hillarious moments throughout the movie, plenty of jokes & many lines in this movie to relate/remember the past movies!<br /><br />Of course all of the Original Cast was back & each cast member kept in tune with their original roles.<br /><br />I like the fact that this movie in the series stayed True to the storyline, antics, characters & humor to the previous big 3 of American Pie, American Pie 2, and American Wedding!<br />The script & writing was Perfect!<br />It was never OVER THE TOP stupid jokes!<br />I never got bored during this movie, and even though it could be considered a bit predictable at times, the story was sooooo goooood, it kept me on the edge of my seat & it had plenty of BIG surprises.<br /><br />Each character brought back so many AWESOME memories from the Original first 3 releases.<br />Every actor played their respective roles to perfection!<br />Each character showed characteristics of the younger days, but maturity of the older days...<br /><br />The movie is a bit raunchy, but it is AMERICAN PIE people, what else would you expect???<br />If they changed the formula, it would Flop & not be good for the True fans!<br /><br />I give this movie an A+ and hope they make another one in the series!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review!

B005WQ42JC|1.0|This movie isn't worth the first notion of putting this non-story on cellulose.<br />The time is worth far too much to spend on this movie mistake.<br />It will be hard to view another Carmen Diaz the same after seeing this bomb.<br />This movie was so bad that I couldn't even give it a whole twenty minutes before turning it off and watching Sharktopus on the SyFy channel.  Hey, at least Sharktopus was a real comedy. Wasn't it?<br />If you want to break up with your girlfriend, take her to see this movie, get up to go to the restroom, and leave.  This movie has even less class than that.<br />Recommendation:  Make yourself some popcorn, share it with your girlfriend, and watch Sharktopus instead.

Despite it being an old movie, I still feel that the production of this movie is still great and original. On top of that, I love to play guitar too, so, for all you guit lovers out there, you have got to watch this movie, Wait for the part where both guitarist challenges each other, you guys won't regret it.
B00671CVBC|4.0|If you like to see the British run, this is a good series.  Don't get too attached to any of the characters - they'll get eaten soon enough.  The dinosaurs always spit the British out after chewing on them, hmmmm?  Needs more salt?
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|[[ASIN:1849385335 Love Never Dies - Piano/Vocal Selections]]<br /><br />I loved the stage show of Phantom of the Opera - yet I thought that the dubbed, badly-lip-synched travesty that was the official DVD film version had sunk low; now, lo, there is a sequel. It is just a complete parody of the original - the score is dreary and repetitive, the lyrics are shocking and the acting is full of camera angle poses.<br />I find it so sad that a man who did produce and write some of the best stage shows has become so detached that he'd sell out his reputation so completely. The only other low point would be to write a Eurovision song contest entry ... !

B0046ECFRM|4.0|Of the hundreds of romance stories I've read, I think this is the 2nd one where the hero was short. Height was not specified but mentioned Anna was as tall as Etienne & that he was short like his father. I think the other book with a short hero is Devil in Winter by Lisa Kleypas, don't remember the exact title.<br /><br />I like the story, it was fun & descriptive. Having spent 3 days in Paris, I could envision the places the characters went to. The dialogue was quirky and fun, characters were likeable.<br /><br />I rate the story 3 1/2 stars. I'm taking 1 star for Anna not telling the principal the word the resident evil girl called Mer; I understand she didn't want to say the word as it was offensive, but she could have wrote it on paper instead. Taking 1 star off because I found Etienne a tad bit douche-y. I mean, c'mon! He says he's been attracted to Anna since day 1, but didn't break up with his gf, even though he was getting emotionally (& physically) connected with Anna for months! I really liked him except for that cowardice. Felt like emotional cheating to me.<br /><br />Overall, still a wonderful, light YA book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written, entertaining and thought provoking.  I read all three in the series and enjoyed them all.  The books were written for teens, so I've heard, but I am definitely not a teen and loved the books.  Enjoy!

0345803485|2.0|I started this book, expecting a real page turner based on reviews. However, I found myself getting more and more annoyed with our heroine's overt shyness and self consciousness - flushing and flushing and blushing over and over. It got old. Okay, I get it, she's shy and presumed inhibited, except when she goes down on the man first time, without gagging. Not real. The pace got so tedious I actually applied for a refund as I couldn't take it any more.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading this series, I was so pleased that I wanted to let the author know what a great story he had created. I emailed him imparting this knowledge and he emailed me right back. It was cool. He also asked me to write a review on Amazon - so here it is...<br /><br />There are signs of a really good read - grabs you right away, can't put it down, think about it all the time, find yourself reading at 236 AM and telling all your fellow readers what an awesome discovery you have made. Oh, and also tracking down the authors email and letting him know all this is a sign as well (1st time I did that).<br /><br />Great premise, good writing, characters you care about, it has an atmosphere you get sucked into, a story that moves along that never lags or gets stuck. If you are a scifi fan you will love, if you like to read you will love and if you don't read this would be a good start!
B00000253N|5.0|38 years after 'Blood on the Tracks' was recorded in 1974, it still stands by common consent as the all-time masterpiece in a life-long career of excellence rarely equalled by any other performer. The songs are as poignant and powerful today as they were in those long-gone Nixon-Ford days when in 1975, this - the original 33rpm vinyl record - hit the streets to the delight of Dylan's millions of devotees and won new converts to his lyrical songwriting and powerful delivery. It's a great, great album, and it hasn't even aged.<br /><br />Much has been made of the marriage break-up of Dylan and Sara Lownds in 1974 as the background to the extraordinary writing on BOtT and it's even been stated that several of the songs are specifically about her. Dylan - and other people close to him - deny this. But for sure, something in 1974 caused him to give birth to his most poignant, poetic, extraordinary and enduring lyrical writing.<br /><br />The follow-up album 'Desire' contains a track called `Sara': they even considered re-marriage in the 1980s.<br /><br />Most fans would agree that Bob's career, though always interesting, contains a few best-forgotten moments. If you're of a later generation and don't know Dylan's work very well, this is a good place to start and might be a revelation: there's not a mediocre track on the album. BOtT is best listened to as a complete work of art from beginning to end.<br /><br />There's humour too, especially on `Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts' with a catchy, upbeat rhythm as backdrop to the unfolding narrative told through the eyes of Bob-the-storyteller, Bob-the-observer as he wryly describes the life-changing consequences a cleverly planned bank raid in a small town have for three characters as their lives are impacted by the gang-leader, the `Jack of Hearts' - an unlikely premise, but one which works. Economy of lyrical writing, witty and clever, it will likely bring a smile to your face every time you hear it and showcases Dylan's literate, clever observational storytelling to balance out the anger and heartache which accumulates through many of the other songs.<br /><br />`Rolling Stone' lists BOtT as number 16 in the 500 greatest albums ever in history, by any artist.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of the first books I purchased on my (brand new!) Kindle and I could not have chosen a more compelling and fascinating novel about family ties, the fun and terror of parenting, and what we choose to see about ourselves and those we are closest to.<br /><br />I hate to give away too much of the story in a review so I will be brief in my synopsis, but this is the story of a man who has chosen to live his life by the letter of the law, all the while maintaining a dark secret about his true roots and what those implications might mean to his future and his family.  After a horrible crime is committed he suddenly finds himself a part of the \\"other team\\" while he staunchly defends his family and his own honor.<br /><br />What I found most compelling are the ambiguities embraced on nearly every level of the story as it unfolds.  You truly can't pick a side from anyone's perspective, as they are frankly all so fascinating and fraught with their own limitations, that you dismiss and then completely concur from one minute to the next.<br /><br />The writing style is literarally sound, fast paced and thoughtfully presented.  I could not stop reading because I just had to know how it was going to end.<br /><br />I was extremely pleased that I read this and would recommend it highly.

193413712X|5.0|Tinkers is extremely vivid and dense like water. Effortlessly, though, the reader is pulled into and out of different streams of consciousness as well as different times and dimensions. So it feels as though you are swimming, floating in H20, or in this case in the words and images of Paul Harding's mind. It is a book written in New England by a New Englander. So perhaps you're swimming somewhere off of the Maine coast or the shores of Cape Cod or Nantucket?
B002S8AGZG|5.0|I love this movie! I remember watching it in the 9th grade and falling in love with it! I was sooooo happy to find it....and on BLU RAY! The movie came fast and is in great condition! Thank you so much!
B006QKJQM6|4.0|Minus a few overly cheezy parts, I enjoyed the film as an adult who loves little kids movies. Also, the plot was missing a few pieces that could have tied it together. So don't going in it expecting it to be up to the standard of the first one, but expect the same style, humor and entertainment and you won't be disappointed.
0307744434|2.0|I liked the originality of Night Circus. The writing is well done and comes across as if written by a practised author. I liked the variety of viewpoints. What I didn't like was a growing dawning as I read the book that I didn't understand the point of it. Unfortunately, I didn't have a eureka moment at the end whereby I understood the concept of it all.  There was not a sense of wonder at the final reveal. What was the point of the end? I didn't get the point of the youthful character in the book who becomes the new organiser of the circus.<br /><br />Spoilers alert... Why did people die? It didn't make sense in the plot, other than to add a `dark element'. However, I didn't find there was anything dark about the story.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't enjoy all the lush descriptions. The first one or two worked for me while the rest acted as book-fillers, and I felt they did nothing to move the plot along. The characters I didn't really warm to, other than the clock-maker. However, I couldn't visualise his circus clock, which marred the evocation.<br />I love fantasy, but this didn't tick the boxes for me.

0061120073|3.0|This widely praised novel by Betty Smith is heartfelt, but frankly boring.  The main plot follows an Irish-Austrian-American girl as she grows up in a slum in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Subplots focus on her family members.  There is a lot of nostalgic detail on life at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I imagine that this book would appeal to people who grew up at that time... but there are few such people alive.  Other themes include the cruelty of people to one another, the rapaciousness of private enterprise, and female strength and resilience.  This wasn't a bad book but there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest, and eventually it became a chore to read.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|this was the first Stieg Larsson book I have read and I thought it was a great read. The characters really came to life and it was difficult to put it down. can't wait to begin the next in the series.
0345803485|1.0|Am I the only woman reading this book that does find this material as offensive, insulting and reactionary?  I undertook the reading of the book because of all the fuss about it but half-way through it, I am appalled.  This puts women way back in our rights to be free-thinking, independent with good self-image.  We are not slaves. We do not find being submissive as a turn-on.  Men would love to have sex robots who do whatever and whenever not to mention willingly seeking out pain as mindless fools.  What century are we in, Ladies?  Would you want this for your daughter, sister or mother?  This sends the wrong message to men as well as putting dangerous signals out there for the treatment of a woman as an equal.  At the very least, put in the \\"contract\\" that each partner alternates being a submissive or dominant to fairly formulate a relationship if that's what you would call this.  I believe this insults men also as defiles of purity.  Disgusting!

0385344228|5.0|As a mental health practitioner who has logged many hours with the dark side, I found this novel to be a fast page turner with a unique premise- that being  14 year old Jacob Barber is accused of the murder of a classmate from a New England Prep School.  With a heretofore \\"perfect\\" family composed of doting parents (the father, Andy Barber being the Chief County Prosecutor of the jurisdiction in which the crime occurs), the author demonstrates real skill in guiding the reader on a journey of family deterioration juxtaposed with the family's attempts to maintain some normalcy while being blindsided by a series of incredibly challenging events.  In addition, the inclusion of the machinations of a possible genetic predisposition to violence not only advances the plot line but also ratchets up the action regarding the validity of the aforementioned theory.  Mr. Landay's insights into the realm of traumatic family dynamics are first rate as well as his ventures into the world of psychopathology.  Even though I did not expect a happy ending, I was literally blown away by the conclusion.  I will certainly read his prior books and anticipate a new thriller.  What a great ride on the suspense highway.<br /><br />Rick David<br />AKA Dr. Evil

B000XR4OC0|1.0|I bought my daughter a pair of red classic Tom's for her birthday because she really wanted a pair. The back of one of the shoes tore after only four months. My daughter was not rough with the shoes and she only wore them two or three times a week (if that). I expected a much higher quality shoe based on the hype and the amount of money ($45) I spent on these shoes. To make matters worse, I cannot get Tom's to return my call or email to discuss the torn shoe. Based on the poor quality of the shoes, I would NOT recommend these shoes to anyone. I would give the shoes a negative star rating if it was possible.

0765365278|5.0|Well I can honestly say this book took me about a week to finish,but I literally couldn't tear my eyeballs from this massive tome. Im no expert on books, or how books are written but i can say this wove a massive tale in my brain it is just an adventure of excitement and valor in my eyes. All and all i will recommend this book to everybody i meet and that envies a good story :]
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Sure there are smaller, lightweight apps and widgets that give the same information, or more, but I think this app is more suitable if you are going to have your phone / tablet displayed on your desk, car, bed side, ect in a dock. It IS eye candy, with a bit of functionality, something I don't mind at all. I also own this App for my iPad. It may have a few issues here and there that have been reported by other users, but that doesn't kill the experience for me.<br /><br />The app plays a beautiful video in the background of it's main screen. The video will change depending on the weather and time of day (missing from the android version, is the ability to cycle through a few appropriate videos for the current condition to one that may suit your mood/taste better). The videos are high quality, hence the bigger file size of the app.<br /><br />If you are looking for a nice app to display on the screen of your device while docked, this is worth a look.
B0076NAWWA|2.0|Not bad, but not great.  Nothing really new here, the best thing about the album is the bass guitar.  MP's drumming is okay, a little over the top for music with really no teeth in the songs.  If this was a first album by people we have never heard of before it would be in the bargain bin somewhere. Or never have been released in the first place.  Who is the traget market? Spock's Beard fans?

0307592731|5.0|for every person that has adventure in their soul. This is Cheryl Strayed's story of her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. The trip took place in the mid-90's when she was at a low point in her life. Her mother had died, she was newly divorced, and truly a \\"lost soul\\". She tackles this adventure on a whim. She hikes 1100 miles of the PCT basically solo. It is a journey of discovery.<br /><br />This book is so well written. She wrote the book 15 years after the trip and because of that she has had the opportunity to reflect on the impact of this adventure on her life. She is so candid about the unravelling of her life (drug use and promiscuity) prior to the trip that it may turn some readers off BUT I hope not. It is so well written that I feel as though I hiked the trail with her. What a remarkable woman!!<br /><br />After I finished the book, I watched the video on this page and really enjoyed the slideshow.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!
0439023483|1.0|This book is a piece of trash. Its premise is demented. Literary value non-existent. The author should be enjoined from ever writing/publishing again.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|OMG! I loved it! I had to stay up all night to finish it and now want to start re-reading it!...but I have Ph.D. work to finish... :-(<br /><br />It was a roller-coaster of a romance with two people who both have some issues that contribute to a tumultuous love affair. U2's song \\"With or Without You\\" is an appropriate song for the background of this story.<br /><br />In real life, the obsessive and possessive male would probably be a huge turn-off for most women, but in this romantic fantasy, in many ways the story is recognizant of anyone who has had to work through and battle emotional baggage issues to achieve the desired state of harmony in their relationship.  And, the female protagonist (while less volatile) has her own demons to confront and work through as the story progresses.<br /><br />One of my favorite fairytales is \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", and the first part of the book kept making me compare it to a modern re-telling of that tale.  I love how \\"the Beauty\\" infatuates \\"the Beast\\" and inspires him to be a better person, and I am glad it took him the length of the novel to grow.  She grows also but learns to accept herself for who she is and to listen to her heart.  Only after she has come to terms with herself and the man has learned to get a grip on his co-dependency issues can these two fated lovers come together permanently.<br /><br />For someone who grades papers all day, the English major in me almost wants to take off a star, but I think that would misrepresent how much I enjoyed this story.  This is one of the few eBooks I have purchased, and I would love to buy a hard-copy someday on the contingency being if the typos were corrected.  I can overlook a few, but it seemed like there was at least one in most of the chapters.

I know more than a couple of people who got into it for the green Orion slave girls.<br /><br />But Star Trek is more than that.  The best speculative fiction always is.

In the Pale Moonlight.<br /><br />Measure of a Man.<br /><br />These episodes, and others, consider the things that are important.  Like the Judge Advocate General in this episode, I am not qualified to answer the questions that these episodes ask.  Watch this one, and decide for yourself.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've tried different headphones through the years. These are by far my favorite for running. I run at least three times a week and these headphones are always reliable. They are not the most rugged, but as good as you can get for the price. Sound is not Bose quality, but good enough for running. This is my second pair in two years.
B0073XORCY|5.0|As with all Tull albums that I'm fond of, I initially am attracted to various bits here and there but either put off or mildly confused by some of what Mr. Anderson is try to say.  Thankfully, this project has enough to keep me coming back that I eventually come to terms with the syntactically 'difficult' parts of the album.<br /><br />As far as how this bad boy measures up to it's predecessor, I'd have to mention two things before providing a verdict: 1) although this is a concept album, it is a collection of songs, not one through-composed piece 2) Ian has decided to interject sections of spoken verse as opposed to composing music for them.<br /><br />That being stated up front, this is a quality album, worthy of many listens (on my 4th in three days, that's a lot for a single father of three).  The players sound like they enjoy playing together, much like TAAB.  The overall tone is more somber and 'mature' but the playing is full of energy.  Ian's flute playing is some of his best. Although the album is made up of separate songs, it does flow together very well and the album should be taken as one large piece.<br /><br />On the critical side, the spoken word segments are hard to swallow, maybe after a few more listens I'll see how it fits in but for now, I cringe when these sections come up.<br /><br />Overall, this is a definite buy.  It may take several listens to 'infect' you but if you're patient, the wait is definitely worth it.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|The only app that I am glad to get an update on. I may get a new level to play! Much more fun than the bird game or any other tower defense.

If you want something that is true to the books I recommend the BBC series.  This is a fun, action packed, exciting adventure that really could have been titled \\"Two Frat buddies in the Industrial Revolution who make jokes and solve crimes in London.\\" If you just take the movie for what it is, you'll enjoy the ride.

This book inspired me to learn more about reincarnation and other points of view on life. I would love to attend one of Wiess regression workshops! This book had so many things I loved that I felt were key to my truth about soulmates and unconditional love that I began to highlight the things i felt were important and spoke to me. I will definitely check out all his other books as well.
0439023513|1.0|(SPOILERS in the last paragraph.)<br />Too bad there's no 0 star option. What can I say that hasn't already been said in the other excellent 1-star reviews? Not much, except that I wouldn't recommend this book, and by extension the series, to anyone. The first 2 books were enjoyable, but the whole time, I was hoping for some kind of lesson/moral/takeaway but found NONE. In fact, some co-workers and I wracked our brains to come up with some kind of moral but couldn't even make one up! In writing YA fiction that has this kind of seriousness, I think the author has a responsibility to have it all make sense somehow. Collins doesn't do that. The closest thing I've even seen as a takeaway is \\"War is bad.\\" Really, Collins, that's all you've got? It's actually more like, \\"War is bad, but inevitable. Just survive the best you can, but don't expect the same for anyone you love.\\"<br /><br />There's a difference between enjoying books while you're reading them and feeling satisfied when they're finished. I enjoyed them as I went along, but the last few chapters on Mockingjay ruined the whole series for me. People will argue, \\"But they kept you reading!\\" Yes, which ends up, in this case, to just be a cheap trick. By the end, I was tired of Collins' one-sentence cliffhanger chapter endings.<br /><br />It's not even so much the happy ending that I had wanted. Kill all the people you want, but give me some kind of REASON. Finnick and Prim's quick deaths were like a slap in the face to those of us who had already stuck with this story for almost 900 pages. As others have said, we learned to love Finnick, and he was unceremoniously killed off in the blink of an eye. Same thing with Prim. The whole series is based on Katniss volunteering for Prim in the first book and her efforts to keep her safe throughout the other two. She and Finnick both deserved more. I feel cheated by the author and really disappointed in the series. In my head, Finnick and Prim are still alive, and Cinna is the new president. THE END!

B0058EBNAO|4.0|Runs with no fuss, performance is acceptable on my aging EVO, customization and options are impressive. UI has improved since first install and ability to monitor several locations and atmospheric conditions at once is a plus. Running default gps settings that give me weather where I am, and it works well. Clock view (round)  has a spot on my home screen and has not let me down yet. Amber alerts, instant severe weather alerts and the ability to email that info to my contacts directly from the app rounds out a very good package. The live radar is a luxury for a phone but works very well on 4g.

Price was in line with ones you can buy in the states so I have no complaints there.  Would buy from seller again.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|This, his first, is one of his best solo albums. It was released as the Beatles were breaking up; indeed, it was the release of this album was one of the first salvos which caused the chain of events which resulted in the ultimate breakup which consisted of Mr. Paul himself going to Court to dissolve the musical partnership. The album cover was one of clues to the Paul-is-dead rumor because it featured a bowl with cherries strewn around it instead of inside. (\\"Life is a bowlful of cherries\\" + photograph of an empty bowl of cherries = Paul is dead.) Now, some forty years later, we all know now that his physical body at least appears alive and well.<br /><br />Many of the songs were snippets of themes developed by McCartney during the Let it Be sessions. If you listen to some of the bootleg recordings of the sessions you will hear some of the songs here, such as \\"Junk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy.\\" The Beatles were always big on arguing with each other through their songs. A famous example is the song from Abbey Road, \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" -- (you only give me your funny paper), a reference to the corporate ownership disputes with Apple Corps. This album has its own snipe from McCartney --- \\"Man we was lonely, man we was lonely, and we were hard-pressed to find a smile.\\"  This is no doubt a reference to the terrific infighting during the final days of the Beatles. McCartney soon released his album, Ram, featuring a photo of Paul grabbing the horns of a ram. John thereupon released his great album Imagine, featuring a photo-postcard of John grabbing the ears of a pig and giving his own little dig with his song, \\"How Do You Sleep (at Night)?\\"  It went downhill from there. This song and others which contain his panegyrics to Linda Eastman, his then new wife, offer a glimpse of what was going through Paul's head at the time. Indeed, the easy-going, lilting pace of the album belies the emotional and personal turmoil he was likely experiencing at the time. It is probably his most personal album.<br /><br />Still, it is a marvelous piece of music.  One of the many talents of the Beatles were their ability to segue songs to make a more enjoyable album. The same is true here. Many of the songs are undeveloped musical ideas, but McCartney had arranging these snippets such that the album works as an entire musical piece. Other songs are truly fully developed, such as \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" one of the best songs he ever composed.<br /><br />Considering his great output over the years since this album, McCartney has only released a handful of truly great albums. McCartney wouldn't release another great album until Band on the Run, and after that, McCartney II. This release, his first solo album, probably tops the list.st personal album.<br /><br />Still, it is a marvelous piece of music.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|The overall culmination of the storyline was a good one, albeit a bit over the top for my taste. I would still recommend it to anyone who loves the series. However, if you haven't followed it to this point you'll be lost.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I just love it. I have 300+ albums in Picasa and Picfolio works awesome! One of my favorite apps. Fast and easy to use.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the best game and if u like Mario then u should definitely get it. get this game listen to me
B004I744AS|5.0|this app is extremely straightforward (when you want it to be) allowing you to quickly navigate to the information you are interested in. however, if you are in less of a hurry the app also provides a great wealth of other assorted information.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Really great movie.  It was so moving and sad at the end because Hachi really missed his master.  I really loved it and have watched it twice.  The length of the movie was just right.  I would recommend anyone to watch it.  I love animal movies anyway.
1451673442|5.0|From the first page I was drawn in to the truth of what Rhonda's message is. I could literally feel the energy of the words, I cried, laughed, and was utterly spellbound by the simplicity of the message, I began the practices and magically my life began changing. I found real gratitude for even the simplest of things in my life, for those in my life, for my dreams. By the time I was halfway through the book, I realised how blessed I am, and how wonderful my life is. My health is improving day by day, my happiness is beyond imagination, the joy I am experiencing is sensational. The things I have been able to bring into my life is extroadinary.<br />To anyone who wants to improve their life, how they feel, their health, their finances, their day to day life, this is the book to read and follow no matter what you may think of some of the methods, I am here to tell you they work. It is truly the best money you will ever spend. Thank you, thank you, thank you Rhonds for your magical words of wisdom and your love of making a difference in people's lives. Keep up the magical work...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thank you, Suzanne Collins for making my life so wonderful!<br />I only learned about this book when I saw a preview for the movie, but once I read it, I knew I'd been missing out for a long time.  The story is riveting, and it's impossible to read one chapter without wanting to read another.  When I finished The Hunger Games, I immediately bought the next two books (and a mockingjay pin).  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested.  (It is a little scary/violent, so I'd say it's appropriate for kids 10+).
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Being a long-time fan of the original John Carter books, I had been waiting for years to finally see these tales brought to the big screen and Disney's production far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />In truth, I am perplexed as to why the film tanked at the box-office and saddened that we will probably never see a sequel but I know it wasn't due to any fault of the actors, the special effects or the story.  I can only imagine that the problem had to be in the marketing and maybe Disney should have kept the original title of \\"A Princess of Mars\\".<br /><br />Looking at the reviews here on Amazon, it appears that the majority are very positive.  If this is the general consensus of those who saw \\"John Carter\\" it is a wonder that the film didn't do much better financially.<br /><br />Well, I, for one, will be pre-ordering the Blu-Ray Combo pack of this movie when it comes available (hopefully there will be such a package) and I will watch this film over and over.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about this film is that it is a sorry thing that we will likely never get any further sequels to this fine sci-fi film.<br /><br />George B.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Crossed is an excellent sequel to Matched.  I love how it is written from Ky's and Cassia's perspective.  Being able to see the relationship from both perspectives is very interesting.  In the last book, I was torn between Xander and Ky.  However, after reading Crossed and seeing Cassia from Ky's eyes, I am 100% Team Ky.  Like Matched, I think that the author wrote this book in a poetic style.  I love the language and the poems that she chooses to include.  The author is very good at weaving themes throughout both novels.  I am excitedly awaiting the next book in the series.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I'm very interested in Greek history and mythology, and this movie was a disappointment. Where do I begin?<br />It seems like the director did not research at all about the time period in which the Trojan War is set. The costumes are all from Classical period Greece, not Mycenaean. Some of the clothes, like Achilles' sarong (which he wears while sparring with Patroclus earlier in the movie) weren't worn in any historical period of Greece, let alone Mycenaean. Troy looks nothing like what it originally looked like in that period (low mud-brick houses packed tightly together). In my opinion, it looked more like Ancient Rome than anything else. The armor is also not historically accurate.<br />Another thing that bothered me was that the director didn't even read the Odessey or Posthomerica or Cypria or the friggin' Illiad for God's sake! First off, Hector was not at the Spartan palace with Paris; Aeneas was. Also, Paris and Helen first \\"did it\\" on Kranai, an island off Lacedaemon's (Sparta's countryside's) coast. It was also fallacious that Helen came to Sparta to marry Menelaus at age 16. Sparta was Helen's ancestral kingdom and she gave Menelaus the right to rule (besides, she would have been about 12 at the time of the marriage, definetely not 16). Patroclus wasn't Achilles' annoying young cousin; in fact, Patroclus was somewhat older and was Achilles' lover as well as cousin. Thetis also goes with Achilles to Troy, a fact that they neglected. Also, in the fight scene in the temple of Apollo, Achilles wouldn't have let Hector go and prolonged the war. He would have killed him, because Achilles is one cold-blooded badass. Also, Briseis wasn't Paris's cousin, nor did she kill Agamemnon (his wife Clytemnestra accomplished that when he came home from Troy). Finally, the \\"good guys\\" (Paris, Helen, Andromache, etc.)didn't escape. Paris died by the arrows of Philoctetes (formerly Heracles' arrows), Helen was sent back to Sparta in disgrace, and Andromache was made Achilles' son's (who is conspicously absent in the film) concubine.<br />The casting was horrible. Brad Pitt was not at all how I imagined Achilles to be. Helen isn't breathtakingly beautiful. She looks like a cheerleader you can easily spot in your local mall gabbing away with fellow cheerleaders. Also, the Trojans, being Anatolians and Hittites, would not have beards. At all. They would also have hair long enough to be put in a ponytail.<br />The writing was sappy, the characters undeveloped, it had a black/white morality... I could go on and on. In short, a very badly made movie.
1469984202|5.0|I'm a college kid and this last semester before graduation is winding down. So, naturally, I am real busy. I barely have time to wrap up school assignments or see all of my friends, let alone free time to myself. Yet, despite this constant nagging in the back of my mind as if I am forgetting to do something, I find myself spending precious hours burning through Wool's Pages. This book is never boring, but unfortunately for me that means I will never put it down. Weird to admit it, but this is the first book I've read through fully in years. Glad I did though, because I forgot how much I enjoyed it.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this flick from beginning to end. If you like futuristic films this would be the one to watch.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Ok Angry Birds Space is the best one yet!!! Aneroid gets it for free!?!!?!? I mean what's up with that????? I guess its cause KINDLE FIRES have the HD version and they don't.... Even though there r only 2 levels its still WAY fun. I hope Rovio comes out with some more levels soon! Its definetly a great new table for AB.... It's a MUST HAVE for AB fans. Trust me on this one. It is a great time waster...<br /><br />GET IT NOW!!!!!!! U don't know what ur missin out on...
B006OCM0G0|2.0|it was stupid. and I laugh a the face of stupidness hahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl; I really don't love it it was not that well made
B004SBQGHS|5.0|On diversion there was this add that was inappropriate.... I mean that loses customers for them.... I pike this cause NO annoying adds and NO bad pics.... It is worth the $ and then u can concentrate oj ur game instead of looking at the stupid adds.... They really bug me so much &gt;:( Get this instead of free totally worth it!!!!<br /><br />Hope this helped :)
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|This was a great movie from beginning to the very end.  It was true to the factual story and showed photos of the people portrayed in the closing credits which was a nice touch. It was well done and well worth the price of the movie ticket. We will also buy the DVD when it is released.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|It only took 7 minutes for me to get hooked (intro scene).  I never read the books, but I'm told that this series follows the originals closely.  The acting is all well done and HBO really has done a lot with the funding they had.  Really immersive and makes you want to finish all episodes in a row.  Only wish they wouldn't have tried so hard to make everyone speak with british accents.  Is it so hard to have each Kingdom have it's own distinct dialect?  I guess that's where LOTR takes a victory.  Just because things are set in quasi-medieval times doesn't mean they're set in England.  Only beef haha.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some were hard and some were easy but it don't matter what it is as long as you were having fun.:)
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The product was amazing and I am really happy that I get to enjoy all of the Beatles' songs when ever.  The service was great and very fast. The box came in great condition. Thank You!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Just finished The Mockingjay.  With a decent screen writer these should make good movies.  But wait for the movies.  Don't read this tripe.  I liked Book 1.  Didn't love it, but it drew me in.  It sets up an interesting, dystopian, post-apocalyptic society with good action and basic characters that you can relate to.  Books 2 and 3 were just bad.  I kept hoping for a character, any character, to behave like an actual person.  Or at least behave in a manner consistent with their previous development.<br /><br />I see a lot of people comparing these books to Rowling's novels.  Here's the difference.  Rowling's characters act like real people.  They behave in a manner that's consistent with the character that she's developed.  In repsonse to circumstances, no matter how fantastic, they react in ways that you can believe.  Katniss is set up as an expert hunter, who can kill, skin and clean her game.  She's the sole provider for her family and has dealt with horrors her entire life.  She's been raised in a mining camp where her father was blown to bits.  Every year she's been forced to watch two of her schoolmates and 21 other kids get executed on television.  She has no problem volunteering for an ordeal where she knows that she'll have to be prepared to kill 23 other young adults.  Later in the series she has no qualms about gunning down unarmed civilians and  anyone that crosses her path (read the last 4 chapters of the Mockingjay for some really incredible scenes of mindless slaughter) but runs away and hides in a closet when her drunk mentor makes a snide remark about her love life.  That's bad character development and it's annoying.  The whole series was annoying.  Just really, really annoying.  How am I supposed to relate to or believe a character that can shoot an 18 year old in the face with an arrow but spends half of the third novel either unconscious or drugged up because of her inability to handle some awful things that happen in the course of a war?  I know I'm not the target audience for these books, but I'm not the target audience for Rowling or Lewis either.  And those are good reads.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I loveeee this app !! but can someone plz tell me how to update it on my kindle fire!? it would be greatly appreciated !! my emails xoxosweetshortie@gma-il.com
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my Fire. Love the hourly forecast as well as the 15 day. Has shown itself to be far more accurate than the weatherman. Think he needs this app.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Excellent movie (DVD). Completes the series \\"Firefly\\" nicely.  A \\"must see\\" for Firefly series fans. Yes, I would agree that you could watch and enjoy this movie without being a series fan, but it helps to have already been familiar with the plot and characters a little. Recommended. I would also note that this movie (and the Firefly series)are geared toward a more adult audience. I keep running into sci-fi series that include children and \\"kiddie\\" plots.... while Firefly is well-written for a more mature audience. Think you will enjoy at any age.
B00577WFOU|5.0|Deep Purple on fire in this show, all members on their game this night...ESPECIALLY BLACKMORE!!! Also great sounding, very well recorded
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I don't really care where the source material comes from... there's nothing \\"original\\" in art or music... all is composted of archetypes of some sort and what of it? It is what you make of it that counts. For me the test of a good movie is \\"did it stick in my head?\\"... and this one really did. I'd see it again in a flat skinny second. I had not read the books when I went to the film so it was with no preconceived notions that I viewed it. The first impression was an overwhelming whirl of image and sensation, which I sorted out afterwards and am still totally impressed by... the casting was great. Obviously Katniss and Peeta, I have absolutely no arguments with their casting... loved them both and the feeling for them has increased in my mind since then, and when I finally did read the book, I could see their faces in the characters I was reading about, and found it a perfect fit. The same with Woody Harrelson's character... he was perfectly cast and did a wonderful job with his character, and in most any other situation he would have walked away with the whole show. I think he spelled it out without saying anything, what a horrible life that character had to lead, every year trying to mentor some kids who would go get themselves killed. Just about everything else worked really well for me. Including the \\"reality show\\" stuff that was built upon (which wasn't exactly in the book), but which I thought really added to the overall thing. A+++
B000002IGV|5.0|Great album through and through, the better songs are Street Justice, Horror Terria, Capt. Howdy. All in all a very strong album!
1451648537|3.0|Liked the book, but the damn thing kept falling apart. I mean the pages<br />broke loose of the binding and fell into my lap. If I was real careful only a few would break loose, but if I turned a page rapidly, a half a dozen would pop out. I hope this isn't typical of the whole batch my book was printed in.
B0067R0APK|5.0|provides the User with timely and accurate information.  nice graphics with an easy to use interface. seems to run in the background nicely without using too many resources nor draining the battery.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|How incredibly open! I can't believe that Nikki Sixx not only lived this insane lifestyle, but lived. And on top of that, shared the details with the world. Incredible book. Incredible read. Incredible journey.<br /><br />Good read. Very good read.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved the game. it just keeps going and going. always something new and interesting... I like all the minigames. you could make it easier to beg coins though.
B0076NAWWA|2.0|Before I listened to the CD, I was already worried when I saw so many 5 star reviews here on Amazon (Smells of plants and fanaticism). Big red flag. Next big red flag was Flying Color's website which is littered with over the top testimonials; \\"... candidate for album of the year\\", \\"10/10\\", \\"9/10\\". Well, either I was going to hear something that would be on the level of one of the great iconic albums in history, or the hype was a bunch of BS. Finally, the endless references to the charts in the Bio section on their website pretty much prepared me for some neo-Asia type album (a bunch of superior musicians shamelessly pandering to the masses trying to misguidedly re-affirm their greatness with the faceless masses).<br /><br />First listen... what a strange, dissonant collection of songs. Almost like 2 or 3 different bands in one, awkwardly looking for an identity. Musicianship is unimpressive for most of the album with occasional proggy sections that would have been interesting 30 years ago. The singer has a nice voice... for a popular or modern rock radio band. Are you guys trying to take a bite out of Nickleback's market share??? Musically, OK to mediocre.. but never really good or great. Which is relevant considering the pedigree of these musicians.<br /><br />Obviously not a lot of time (or forethought?) went into this album.  There is nothing original - mostly formulaic. No evolution of any of the various categories (Prog Rock, Hard Rock, Metal..) they play. Certainly, with this collection of musicians, especially Mike Portnoy who perhaps might have taken this opportunity to say \\"Oh yeah, see, not only have I not lost it, but I'm back better than ever baby!\\", I would have expected at the very least, some evolutionary music.. if not revolutionary. Is it fair to judge based on the pedigree and clear potential of these artists? I remember that question being asked when Yes and RUSH and other similar bands went soft and pandered to the public with albums that were designed to get air play and top the charts. Well, is it fair? Bloody well right it's fair. If you dare to carry the moniker of \\"Progressive Rock Musician\\" then you have made a irrevocable contract with yourself as an artist, and yes, with your fans (not the \\"Johnny Come Lateley's\\" that jump on the band wagon when your sound gets pop'y and want to pretend they are more evolved than their pop sucking friends), to push yourself to evolve your art and inspire listeners to also evolve musically and otherwise. That's what \\"progressive\\" rock has been about since it's birth. It's not something you can weasel out of. Where you chart is meaningless. If you don't challenge yourself as a musician, and you don't challenge your audience, then there is simply no point - it's just noise.<br /><br />There are a couple songs on this album that are OK, somewhat more challenging but for these guys, they could do it asleep, one hand tied behind their backs (for the most part). But, why pay money to listen to these guys sandbagging... pandering. Like a Formula One car cruising at the posted speed limit.<br /><br />The established prog fans and the prog musicians will see this album for what it is. Ironically, Portnoy and the musicians he worked with in the last two decades and created iconic works with, have inspired a new generation and new waves of prog (rock/metal) musicians that are now the ones making relevant music, eclipsing their own heroes and former icons. Just like Dream Theater and others once did.<br /><br />If you are a real prog fan, then this lyric will strike a chord:<br /><br />Plus ca change,<br />Plus c'est la meme chose,<br />The more that things change,<br />The more they stay the same.<br /><br />One of the ugliest times for me musically was the early 1980's. To see a music god like Steve Howe playing in \\"Asia\\"...  amongst other horrors. Is this an \\"Asia\\" moment for Portnoy and co.?<br /><br />... sorry bro (MP).esigned to get air play and top the charts. Well, is it fair? Bloody well right it's fair.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I had hoped that the HBO program (Season 1)would be a credit to George R R Martin's first book in his Ice and Fire series...and I was not disappointed.  There were so many points in the storyline where the film could have strayed or not lived up visually to the descriptions in the book and the producers/directors/actors all deserve great credit for pulling off such a very difficult task.  This is definitely a 5-star production and it is worth every penny!
B004LWZW24|5.0|simply one of the best to scare all of us...it´s got all ingredients to make us \\"unconfortable\\" since the very beggining
B007DIQB50|5.0|If you're a Nicki Minaj fan you'll like this album but if you're a fan of legit rap music, skip it. This album is pure pop for the masses and something fun to dance too. Do not expect any profound lyrics to touch your soul or inspire you, expect excessive rhyming of no real meaning and bad singing. Don't get me wrong, I honestly love it. Shes an artist selling a pop princess persona to the masses and making bank. Expect some top ten pop songs off this album.

B0067Q04AM|5.0|I am on the late freight. I had never heard of Robert. I saw a mini-blurb on him in Ebony magazine and when I saw the artists he was working with, I thought it might be along the lines of music that I am into. I THOUGHT RIGHT. Let me say thank God Amazon allows you to preview an album by listening to snippets. Even though these snippets were seconds long, I KNEW that I would enjoy this CD.<br /><br />There is nothing that I can't already add to these glowing reviews. Lalah Hathaway's rendition of Sade's song Cherish is absolutely beautiful. Bilal's voice is on two tracks and I am always impressed at his vocal talent. His voice is a brand unto itself.  Erykah delivers as always. Stokely from Mint Condition's voice was so beautiful that it was hard to distinguish it from an actual instrument. Ledisi's tract was predictably good. She can sang the phone book as far as I am concerned.<br /><br /> Yasin Bey formerly known as Mos Def, DELIVERS the most head \\"noddingest\\" joint I have heard this year. I love Yasin's voice, he is like a hip hop Billie Holiday.<br /><br />But my absolute FAVORITE tracks are Michelle Ndegeocello's Consequences of Jealousy and Musiq/Chrissette Michelle's duet. Whenever I hear them both,  I don't know whether to cry or exhale. Beautiful is an understatement. It is HAUNTING.<br /><br />If you are a non-mainstream TRUE music lover, then you will enjoy this CD. It has been on constant loop in both my office as well as my car.<br /><br />Well Done Sir!!!
B003NHRGSQ|2.0|I would like to tell you how much I really liked this book, and how the second book was so much better than the first...but I can't. The book was ok, and maybe I should give it another star or at least half a star because the writing was well done and eloquent, but I'm not going to. This book was just so boring, and slow it felt much longer than it actually was because the pacing was just dragging. The main characters just weren't as interesting this time around. Cole was actually a better character than  Sam or Grace, he had an interesting past, and seemed to be going through a lot and digging around through his brain would have been a great story. Honestly this story is lacking a real plot, yes we find out more about everyone, yes it moves the story forward (very, very slowly), but it was predictable and uninteresting and could have been shortened down quite a bit. The writing is great, the story is meh, but I'll still read this last book of this trilogy.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|Loved this movie - it hit home in so many ways, but of course, was pure fantasy.  A perfect movie for a 70's child.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The plot has lots of twists and turns and it kept my attention totally.  Will look for my books by this author.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I Loved this book!! Fell in love with the characters and hope that Jamie has a part two, to this book! I hate leaving a book wondering what happened to the main characters after the end! I felt sad when the book ended. I wanted to keep reading about Pidge and Travis!

B007MNV5WU|5.0|well when I first saw this game I thought I was a little bit to much. But after a while I figured that I was going to buy this game. I have come to realize this game is great with awesome graphics and gameplay. I recommend this game.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I must admit, I'm new to the music of Dr. John, and this album only came to my attention as it is produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, one of my favourite bands. The sound is Afrobeat infused Blues (polyrhythms permeate all the tracks), and all ten songs are good with catchy hooks and superb musicianship, with Dr. John's weathered vocals (he is after all 71) sitting comfortably atop the grooves.<br /><br />Opening is the title track (with a guitar-shredding solo, and a vibraphone solo near the end), followed by the bouncy \\"Revolution\\" (with great organ and baritone sax - my favourite), the tender \\"Big Shot\\", the shuffling rhythmic Afrobeat of \\"Ice Age\\", the groovy \\"Getaway\\" (with some dischordant effects), the funky \\"Kingdom Of Izzness\\" (with some soothing female harmonies smoothening out any abrasiveness), the percussion-rich \\"You Lie\\", \\"Eleggua\\" (very Seventies Funk/Soul), and the gentle enchanting piano-sprinkled ballad :My Children, My Angels\\".<br /><br />Closing the collection is \\"God's Sure Good\\", a gem with reflective lyrics and a Gospel choir punctuating in bursts. This album is sure good!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to find scriptures &amp; switch from different versions. I love the highlight/bookmark options &amp; that I can take notes (tricky at first). I also love the reading plans! I've tried other app versions &amp; this is definitely the easiest to use especially when you are in church with different scriptures coming up quickly. It's free! What do you have to lose!?

By now, you might know the smash single \\"Someone That I Used To Know\\", a lilting shuffle (with Kimbra adding her breathy vocals) that manages to incorporate \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep\\" chimes into the melody. An absolute killer! Well, there's loads more to love.<br /><br />Gotye sounds in turn like Sting or Peter Gabriel, and the album features a diverse array of sound, from the opening brief Prog Rocky intro \\"Making Mirrors\\", to the brief Alt Rocker \\"Easy Way Out\\", the galloping \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", the dark and creepy \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\", the soulful Motown bounce of \\"I Feel Better\\", the horn-sprinkled moody Dub of \\"State Of The Art\\" (with deep distorted vocals), the spare atmospheric \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You\\", to the closing hymnal ballad \\"Bronte\\", everything stands out.<br /><br />This album is like nothing else on the charts. Highly recommended! Now I'm seeking out his other albums...
0307956350|3.0|Others have summarized the plot well. The Expats received high praise by normally highly reliable reviewers in the NY Times and Washington Post. Sadly, the writer constantly and clumsily switches from past to present to future, with none of the 3 narratives ultimately holding together.  There are some interesting twists--but a novel needs to be better than this one in between the twists.  This one is too repetive and the CIA heroine is very naive.
B007RPM1B2|3.0|I love that I can always come to Amazon and buy episodes of my favorite shows that I've missed. However, I am sorely disappointed that Amazon describes this as a 2-hour finale and then only gives me 52 minutes. What gives??
B006PTZNSY|3.0|[Good Songs]<br />(1)Roman Holiday: Fun/Theatrical/Similar to Missy Elliot's old songs but the singing gives it more character<br />(4)Beez In The Trap: Unique, minimalist beat/Good 2 Chainz verse/Catchy street song<br />(8)Right By My Side: Catchy pop song<br />(15)Marilyn Monroe: Catchy pop song/No rapping<br />(16)Young Forever: Catchy pop song/No rapping<br />(17)Fire Burns: Short/catchy pop song/No rapping<br />(18)Gun Shot: Best song on the album/Good beat/Great Beenie Man contribution/No rapping<br /><br />[Garbage]<br />(5)Hov Lane: Annoying beat/Chorus<br />(6)Roman Reloaded: Annoying beat/Chrous<br />(10)Starships: Crappy Dance Track<br />(11)Pound The Alarm: Crappy Dance Track<br />(12)Whip It: Crappy Dance Track<br />(13)Automatic: Crappy Dance Track<br />(14)Beautiful Sinner: Crappy Dance Track<br />(19)Stupid Hoe: WTH?<br /><br />[Meh Songs]<br />(3)I Am Your Leader: Features are forgettable/Beat isn't too great<br />(9)Sex In The Louge: Mediocre/Has no place on this album<br />(2)Come On A Cone: Catchy at first but forgettable after a while/Nothing unique about it<br />(7)Champion: Great verses by Nas and Nicki/Other guests are forgettable/Beat gets boring after first play<br /><br />[Bottom Line]<br />This isn't a \\"bad\\" album, it just has too many songs on it with no real substance or direction. When I heard about the \\"Roman Reloaded\\" subtitle, I thought this was going to be more of a concept album, but it's all over the place. I've been a supporter of Nicki since her last album (Which I loved) but she really needs to sit down and figure her identity out. She's spending too much time on gimmicks and not enough time on the direction of her music.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the pop songs Nicki had on her last LP you will like most of the songs I listed as, \\"Good\\". However, if you're more of a hiphop fan, don't expect much outside of 'Champion' and 'Beez In The Trap'. This album isn't consistent enough to purchase, no matter what style you prefer. So unless you're a 'Barbie' super fan, I would strongly suggest buying the songs you like, individually.<br /><br />Iumak gives this album, a 6.5/10
0062082353|5.0|Fantastic Read- The book was hard to put down. It was so lifelike and should have a movie made from it.
1463514581|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I downloaded it because it was being offered free and seemed like something I would like. I set down to read it and had finished eight hours later. I could not pull myself away. I loved the characters of the book. Seemed there could have been a little more focus on the mystery part but it still was quirky and entertaining. Must Read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy was wonderful.  I had a difficult time putting the book down and would definitely recommend this book.
0545265355|5.0|A friend of mine had allowed me to borrow (more like forced me to borrow) their copy of the Hunger Games to read.<br />After reading the first book I was hooked and decided to purchase the series. Personally, I'm the type of person that If I start a book series and like it, I buy the books. So I looked at the hard cover prices online and saw the Box set deal, and was satisfied.<br /><br />shipping was a little slow but besides that I was satisfied with the product.<br />All three books are worth reading.

B0017X5H1Q|5.0|W. Somerset Maugham was a prominent and prolific writer in the first half of the 20th Century.  One of his last major efforts, 1944's \\"The Razor's Edge\\", is still in print and still highly regarded.  In this well-crafted story, Maugham follows the lives of a handful of characters as their lives repeatedly intersect in the years between the world wars.<br /><br />Maugham inserted himself into the story as narrator.  Story venues in Chicago, London, Paris and the French Riviera are recreated in loving detail.  The leading characters are living, breathing, well-rounded human beings, each in search of success in life, and each perhaps finding his or her own destiny.  The center of the story is Larry Durrell, an aviator who survives the First World War with PTSD and a yearning for inner peace.  Larry's willingness to follow his yearning wherever it takes him will mark him as different from his contemporaries.  Isabel, Larry's first fiance, seeks a marriage that brings wealth, children, and social prominence.  Sophie, Larry's second fiance, wants relief from a troubled life of substance abuse.  Larry's friend Gray is the quintessinal decent and conventional guy.  Elliot is Isabel's social-climbing uncle, a fixture of the French social scene in search of the next invitation.<br /><br />The slow unfolding of the story places the lives of the leading characters in stark contrast and sometimes in conflict.  Maugham provides some terrific dialogue, laden with sharp social commentary.  The author saves most of the punch lines for late in the novel, but the narrative journey is likely to be fascinating to the patient reader.  The ending is unconventional; it may be thought-provoking to some readers and frustrating to others.  \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is very highly recommended to fans of W.Somerset Maugham's novels.

B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|I'm still having a hard time digesting the comment placed by an idiot and his loving sister that this disc sucks?! Are you high? drunk perhaps? did \\"One of these days\\" scare both of you? do you recognize and appreciate great music, that's 20 years ahead of it's time when you hear one? I'm not going to waste your time by telling you that this particular record, has been loved by not only millions and millions of Pink Floyd fans around the globe but most classic rock music fans in general. But I know you wouldn't understand that. From the simplicity of Seamus to a deep darkness of Echoes, sketches the talent of Gilmour and Waters like there were no others, ever. If you like the Beatles, that's fine, but I assure you that this record is anything but of a love poems or such beautiful harmonies. Please tell your sister to sell her copy to someone who'll appreciate it and will be a proud owner of this often imitated but never duplicated disc.
B007BWUK3W|3.0|This is the next best thing to owning the original 1992 12\\" vinyl pressing, which has since been out of print and was only ever available in Europe.<br /><br />the records themselves are gorgeous, very thick vinyl discs. The artwork is not very good because it is a scan of the original release, so the pictures are a bit fuzzy and so is the wording.<br />still looks presentable though, so if you can't afford the expensive out of print version, then you should get this one.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I have used this meditation timer daily since I bought the app. I credit using this app with building my daily practice. I highly recommend it. The tones of the Tibetan singing bowls are authentic with true sound, aftertones and decay. Excellent tool for the serious meditation practitioner.
B0073ODRKG|3.0|This is an ideal set for someone who doesn't own any of the albums OR for collector's who will enjoy the alternate card sleeves in the box. Be advised though that the artwork for the the sleeves is definitely lacking in quality. This is because they did not source the original artwork files, instead, they scanned the art from other physical releases and it looks fuzzy, especially on Bedtime Stories, which is the worst one. the back cover is especially bad.<br /><br />Musically, there's nothing new here.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is surprising, engaging, and addicting.  the losses of energy every five seconds and the only available if u buy money upgrades and builidings are annoying,  but not enough to make this any less enjoyable.

1451648537|5.0|We, Americans, are fascinated by excellence, not only with products but also with the process. Seemingly magical results leads to wonder about what their edge is and what made them so special.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson's \\"Steve Jobs\\" more than satisfies our wonder about Apple, and its founder, Steve Jobs. This is one of the best, if not the best, biographies I have ever read. With only the cover design (simply exquisite, bathed in white, with sharp contrasting black graphics and type) under control by Jobs, we get the unvarnished truth about one of America's great innovators and what it took to launch \\"insanely great products\\" that transformed whole industries - home computers, digital pictures (Pixar), music, mobile phones, content-creation, digital newspapers and books, and more.<br /><br />Great ideas are hard to come by. But... putting them to work is even harder. \\"Jobs\\" provides insights into how Jobs used his intuition - connecting the dots among widely disparate experiences, observations, and changes in technology - and his unwavering intensity and focus to create and innovate. He could absorb information, sniff the winds, and sense what lay ahead.<br /><br />While Jobs was a visionary, inspiring, brilliant, and mercurial, he also twisted the truth and distorted reality to achieve his goals. He was notoriously arrogant in dealing with others and alienated large swaths of people throughout his career. Many who worked with him had mixed feelings of contempt and admiration about him. The fact that he let Isaacson write this without any control over content is extraordinary, in particular with an uber-controller like Jobs. One has to wonder why Jobs did not intercede...was this his final \\"confession,\\" an admittance that he did screw up relationships by subjugating human dignity to his quest for product perfection?<br /><br />Is \\"Steve Jobs\\" ultimately about repenting?<br /><br />Maybe \\"Steve Jobs\\" was his way to purge his soul, ask for forgiveness for being a smuck, and prepare the path forward. His sister, Monica, noted that Job's last words were \\"Wow, Oh Wow,\\" letting us know he was not only ready but sensing and seeing what lay ahead.uck, and prepare the path forward. His sister, Monica, noted that Job's last words were \\"Wow, Oh Wow,\\" letting us know he was not only ready but sensing and seeing what lay ahead.
B000LW7N9S|5.0|After the long-dormant Star Trek franchise was revived with Robert Wise's widely anticipated but often slow-paced \\"[[ASIN:6300216802 The Motion Picture]],\\" a film that had a \\"sex with a computer\\" premise, everything was put right with this sterling follow-up effort.<br /><br />In PARAMOUNT's second Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN (directed by Nicholas Meyer), the decades seem to drop away and we're right back amidst those vintage Trek TV shows, thanks in great part to a spot on script and Ricardo Montalban's magnificent reprise of the evil superhuman of the \\"Space Seed\\" episode, marooned so long ago with 80 of his followers on Ceti Alpha V by Capt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk.<br /><br />Furthering the illusion of time stood still in this swashbuckling sci-fi adventure is Leonard Nimoy's recital of a revamped \\"Space... the final frontier\\" opening speech, also a self-admittedly aging Kirk's assignment to the equally high-mileage original USS Enterprise (NCC-1701), which has been reduced to an outmoded training ship.<br /><br />Kirk and his crew of newbies, among them Vulcan/Romulan designated commander Lt. Saavik (Alley) are on a two-week milk run that includes the infamous Kobayashi Maru simulation, when barrel-chested Khan Noonien Singh and 15 other genetically engineered survivors take control of the USS Reliant and its commander, Pavel Chekov.<br /><br />Khan and Reliant attack Space Station Regula 1, where Kirk's lover and adult son are developing a Genesis Device. After receiving Regula 1's SOS, Kirk relieves Saakik of command and warp speeds toward the station. While enroute, a surprise attack from Reliant cripples Enterprise and kills many of its green crew. Next comes a cat-and-mouse war sequence inspired by [[ASIN:6301662954 THE ENEMY BELOW]] (1957), a battle of wits between two old adversaries in which only one will survive.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.7) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/Walter Koenig/George Takei/Nichelle Nichols/Paul Winfield/Kirstie Alley/Ricardo Montalbanh of Khan (1982) - William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy/DeForest Kelley/James Doohan/Walter Koenig/George Takei/Nichelle Nichols/Paul Winfield/Kirstie Alley/Ricardo Montalban
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I purchased this as an e-book on my kindle. It impressed me very much, I agree with the authors theories and have thought about which love language family members use. The models illustrate that you can change the quality of your relationships and your life, if you adapt to the person's needs.
B004I744AS|5.0|The simplicity of the product user interface belies its facility and comprehensiveness.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow!!!!! I am absolutely amazed at the quality of writing and intensely engaging story, especially from an independently published book. Please support this author and read this book and any of his others!! I want Mr. Hugh Howey to never stop writing, as I plan on reading all of his current and future books. I can easily see a movie being made from this book. I can only hope that the author continues to write more books about the silos and maybe even go back in history to explain how it all happened!!

Always loved the Apple even before I got a Kindle but lately I save where I'm reading, go to homescreen, come back and all is OK, THEN I come back later or the next day and it sets me back to first page, if I try to synch it &quot;offers&quot; me to synch to my &quot;furthest location &quot; but it's the location I was 6 days ago!! That's just WRONG! Fix it please...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on the Today show and thought I would give it a try.  I loved it!..I'd never read romance erotica before and I'm so glad that this is the first one I'd ever read.  I COULD not put the book down.  Has a great story with some pretty steamy sceneds...Definetly recommend this book...
B001U6YI92|4.0|\\"You see, there are two kinds of people in this world. Those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You, dig!\\"<br /><br />I love the near ending of this film. Starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach.<br /><br />This final standoff is awesome. The music adds abrasiveness to the tension. This three hour movie requires a little patience. Something today's 'anxious immediate gratification hungry' audiences may not be able to embrace, but there is a lesson to be learned here about why some movies are legendary classics, where today \\"let's quickly get this over with\\" type films are forgotten nearly as quickly as its last day in the public theatre. Wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />This is one of those movies that made Clint Eastwood a legend!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow....What can I say about our Fifty Shades?  The conclusion ( and I hate to see it end) was fantastic.  Great story, great steamy scenes and a great ending.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this...I'm just sad that it's over...Gonna miss Fifty Shades a lot

B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I couldn't wait to get into this book.  I was not disappointed.  The book dove into move of the story of Christian's past and his personality.  It was an amazing book and I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend it..
1451673442|5.0|The book is as I had thought - Positive enforcement...<br />Easy read.  A delightful outlook about how we think and behave.
1609611543|4.0|Good points made about dropping the carbs in wheat like breads, donuts, cookies, pies, cereals, crackers, hotdog buns etc. However the book does not address the need for fiber and should. I did change my diet as a result, and do feel more energy. Only losing about a pound a month however, because cheese and icecream, eggs and good fats, meats and veggies, fruits, all allowed. Book is worth a read.

B005CA4SQK|5.0|Wow, this series has blown my mind, great charactors, great story and amazingly awesome zombies, very believable, acting is great.<br />I'm a huge zombie fan and often zombie movies get compared to the remake of Dawn of the Dead, not only do I believe the walking dead to be in the same league, but surpasses the previous bench marks, as a series it is afforded time to tell a real story and develop real charactors.<br />Blu-ray does the high budget and great make up justice, zombies are believable and detailed even in full HD<br />I can not wait for series 2, hopefuly we get more than 6 episodes<br />I give this 5 stars, not just based on it being great for the zombie genre but for its high quality compared with all genres.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Its very easy to use.  Interfaces well with networking sites.  It seems to be a good app.  I love God's Word so that makes me a little biased.

B0051CSI0G|3.0|Pretty cool movie, post appocolypse world, great atmesphere.<br />The vampires are more like zombies, they are zombie vampires, they burn in daylight and die by staking in the heart, but they are also stupid, animalistic, deformed monsters.<br />The setting is very zombie like to, pockets of human survivors struggling to survive in a world during a vampire appocolypse.<br />The movie has a pretty cool begining and middle but sorta loses its way towards the end.<br />I'de give Stake land 6.5/10<br />watch if you like vampires that are monsters as aposed to sissy boys, also watch if you love zombies
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella is the author of the popular Shopaholic series featuring the delightful and unconsciously hilarious Rebecca Bloomwood Brandon.  In I've Got Your Number, Kinsella gives us a brand new heroine, Poppy Wyatt, a physiotherapist who loses her precious vintage engagement ring and then has her equally precious cellphone stolen.  Without her phone, she'll never find her ring.  When she fortuitously spots a discarded cellphone in the trash, Poppy picks it up.  The owner on the other end -- a stranger -- turns out to be just the man to waken her mind to the truth about her fiance and her heart to a love that matters.  Kinsella's heroines are lovable and funny, self-deprecating in the most engaging way.  The author's subtle critique of the intellectual and business elite is pointed but neither preachy nor cynical.  Her prose is hip and engaging, her humor infectious, her plots zany but just credible enough to maintain the illusion of reality.  Even though I rarely use a cellphone and never text, I enjoyed Poppy's incessant use of the device.  I read this very funny book in two days.  I have yet to learn to text, however.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|wow, just mesmorising and haunting.<br />Not only does it stay true to the Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera but it improves it.<br />Everything is high quality, the set design and cotuming is beautiful, the direction brilliant and the performances are enchanting.<br />The music and the tale will last with you long after viewing
0375815260|5.0|This book gives a more imagintive feel than the movies. Though the movies are great, imagination can fill in the gaps while reading this book and it can be even more of an adventure than watching the movies!
B002WY65W4|4.0|I love this movie<br />Staring some great up and coming actors and a screen veteran.<br /> Jesse Eisenberg is Columbus the dorky yet lovable narator, Emma Stone is purely magnetic as always, Abigail Breslin is a convincing tough kid forced to be adult and young sister to Emma Stones charactor but its the veteran actor who steals the show, Woody Harrelson in one of his greatest rolls as Tallahassee, a tough badass lovable redneck with a healthy appetite for killing zombies.<br />This is just a fun action comedy filled with quirky charactors and humor, great action and cool death scenes.<br />The zombies all look awesome and scary but it is the chemisty and whitty dialogue between the lead charactors that serves up the greatest treat, you wll fall in love with the charactors.<br />Zombie fan or not, this movie is for all action or comedy lovers, it is simply just fun to watch.<br />Sure to be a cult classic, I've already watched it several times.
1402766904|4.0|Great book! Different perspective than the movies. As everytime you read a book after watching the movie, your imagination can certainly fill in more information from the book versus actors acting in a movie.
B001TOD9VI|4.0|Mickey Rourke is absolutely, heart brakingly brilliant but be warned this is not a feel good movie, it is a realistic look behind the curtain of the professional wrestling world.<br />The story of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson(Rourke)though fictional mirrors the lives of many of the 80's wrestling superstars dealing with painkiller and other drug addictions and a seperation from the outside world.<br />Once a superstar and all time great of pro wrestling, Randy the now aged and an old man is now wrestling in school gyms for little pay earning just enough to scrape by in life, just a shaddow of his former self and sold out arenas of his path, but wrestling is all he knows.<br />The Wrestler is a reminder that the larger than life wrestling heroes from our child hood are human who have often sacrificed all they have to be left with nothing but hurt and pain and shattered relationships from a life constantly on the road.<br />Marisa Tomei's part is not to be understated, she plays Randy's regular stripper who he has developed some what of a weird bond through many years of being a customer, Like Randy Marisa's charactor is also aging and has her best years behind her. Sadly Randy's bond with his stripper is essentially the only functioning relationship in his life seeing as his daughter hates him<br />Don't watch this if your wanting a Rocky style feel good story, this is a sad movie but is worth the journy
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the time for everything to regenerate goes out of sync my tomatos should only take 30 seconds to grow not 15 hours. same with my buildings and energy what a waists of time
B003Y5H5FQ|3.0|I have always loved the original so I was a little apprehensive checking this one out but I am glad I did, it remains true to the originals vibe, a little quirky, a little corny and all fun.... with the added bonus of 3D.<br />One of the biggest changes is a much younger Peter Vincent, he is a modern day celeb male diva(think of Russel Brand charactors) I actually quite liked this change, this movie is good enough to stand alone to the newer generation or sit right next to your copy of the original, it is entertaining, refreshing and fun and does justice to the original.<br />It doesn't over use the 3D effect and there for has more impact when put to full effect used to make you jump, and in my opinion the vampire exploding in sunlight in 3d is the best death scene I have seen in the last year, truely an awesome moment.<br />I really would have liked to have given the rating of 3 and a half stars
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I was not happy when my book club selected this book as our next read.  But, I was pleasantly surprised. The book was interesting, engaging and fast to read.  It really gives a different perspective.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Wow such a visually stunning movie witha superstar cast all delivering supersar performances.<br />Mickey Rourke as marve is the stand out, but all the connected mini storys are highly entertaining and charasmatic.<br />The cinema photography is stunning with black and white being used to emphasis color of stand out features like red lips, greeen eyes, bright white blood, its like watching a comic book actually burst into life.<br />at times gory and violently beautiful, but at all times purely awesome
0307956350|3.0|As I opened this book I was lured by all the commentary across the back of the cover and inside the first few pages: I was in for a page turner, well composed by a surperb writer. Not! It is a mildly interesting read but where was the intrigue?  Why didn't I feel the suspense? Why wasn't I tempted to keep reading until the \\"secrets\\" were revealed? It never did it for me.<br /><br />First of all, I found it unbelievable that a common everyday mom/homemaker could be a killer given the supplied but minimal details?  Her prior \\"occupation\\" sort of slipped out with very little reason to believe it.  The author seemed to enjoy the back & forth with time frames, one minute in the present and then one or two years previously. Rather like the filling in a sandwich on the outside rather than in between. His tendency to filter out bits & pieces of strategic facts provided for ready confusion along with a great deal of misguided descriptions tending to distract the story line.<br /><br />A pre-requsite for me in any good story is liking the characters.  Even if they are villians or do not possess any admirable qualities I want to feel they hold some redeeming values I can recognize.  I kept trying to get inside the various characters' heads to understand why they were doing what they were but everyone maintained a facade.  It was a game they were playing throughout; the author thought this was sufficient to keep his reader hooked? Just when I thought the facts were falling into place the author shifted gears and left me woefully disappointed. When the facts are finally revealed they spill out in a confusing and interrupted flow that seems to slide back & forth between believability and untruths.<br /><br />Any good story begins with a premise and develops the plot with cleverly crafted details.  Even the sentence structure at times was disconcerting.  When I'm reading and finding fault with the placement of nouns or adjectives - oops!  Someone blew it because it's like being ina movie when you notice out of order props or a misplaced microphone that obviously should never have been seen. An editor didn't finish his job with careful editing.<br /><br />I struggled to finish this book even though I definitely wanted to get to the end of the story to find out WHY or WHAT. There were enjoyble descriptions of European locales but there was more to grow frustrated with. I kept waiting for the fun parts but wherever they were they fell far too short for my levels of approval. In the last few pages when the questions seem to answer, did they?  Rambling details, unfocused players in the intrigue and far too many broken descriptions that distracted rather than complementing the ending.<br /><br />This was one of those disappointing books that held a lot of promise but didn't deliver.  If I were the author's editor I'd suggest he start all over again and rewrite.  It could have been a great read and fascinating tale but spy thriller it was NOT!
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Insidious builds to some decent chills and a couple of scares and is a very good haunting movie.<br />The second half has a strong Poltergeist feel to it and closer resembles Polergeist than Paranormal activity but a little scarier and a little less corny.<br />To be watched late at night with the lights off.<br />I insidious 3.5 out of 5
B007BLCJJ6|4.0|Very good movie.  Elizabeth Olsen is an incredible actress.  This movie is very intense & has some very disturbing scenes.  It also leaves you wanting more for Elizabeth Olsens character.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Shining more light on a path traveled earlier in \\"Nebraska,\\" \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" and \\"The River,\\" Bruce Springsteen in \\"Wrecking Ball\\" once again provides timely insight about the lives of ordinary men and women caught in down financial times not of their doing and with a limited ability to control events, which are in the hands of the powerful who themselves are largely unaffected.<br /><br />His moral compass provides solutions pointing in different directions.  On one hand, he is leading the charge to tear down the walls of inequities with any means necessary. On the other hand, he summons faith and hope to make it through these hard times so in the end our collective better angels can prevail and everyone can receive a fair share at the table of life.<br /><br />Although he has touched on these themes before, the music in \\"Wrecking Ball\\" follows a different direction from his other albums.  \\"Wrecking Ball\\" provides a strong measure of Irish-influenced marching tunes to lead us once more unto the breach and spiritual gospel music to help us get to safer ground.<br /><br />All the songs fit collectively, but they are also worthwhile individually and remind the listener of thoughtful musicians of the past who also thought fairness and equality matter and should be sung about.  In \\"Jack of All Trades\\" Bruce Springsteen writes about the common man in a way that summons the spirit of the Man in Black himself, Johnny Cash.  Although not as lengthy or danceable  as the live version as \\"Live in New York City, \\"The Land of Hope and Dreams\\" remains one of Mr. Springsteen's best songs ever, with music and lyrics that evoke a big tent vision of America espoused years ago by Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land.\\"  Although the reasons for the economic discontent today may be different from the disharmony experienced during the 1960's and 1970's, the soulful \\"Rocky Road\\" evokes the sound and the feelings of Marvin Gaye's album, \\"What's Going On?\\"<br /><br />With so many spiritual themes and references included in \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" it makes one believe in the power of music to provide sustenance for the soul.  It also answers the question conclusively whether there is a rock and roll heaven.  For any disbeliever, there is living proof.  With 17 divinely inspired albums and a musical career of unparalleled depth,  Bruce Springsteen proves that heaven must exist, as he is God's gift to popular music.
0439023521|5.0|Having plunged into the great literary classics, during college and after being employed by the US Government, I found this book. I was a skeptic. It was described as a book that \\"guys\\" would not like.<br /><br />Well , 2 chapters into it, being able to see the groundwork being laid, I was hooked. Kind of like the Davincci Code, The Jungle and even the Grapes of Wrath. The book set the hook and I was then along for the ride.<br /><br />Not too much to tell so as to keep the integrity of the story whole to the unread readers here, but, I will say it is a reality that could exist somewhere, someday.<br /><br />The girl grabs your heart from step 1, the brutality yet civility of the situations leads one to not fully grasp the concept until thunderdome ie... The Arena.<br /><br />All in all, must read for those who are literary or even literate. Pick it up, fall in love and hold on for the ride.<br /><br />Overall one of the best I have read since Agelas Ashes or even the coveted Jungle.<br /><br />Good reads people ~!~<br /><br />J/K
0985081821|3.0|I'm still not sure what to rate this book, or how I feel about it over all. I finished this almost a week ago, and I'm still scratching my head over it. I'm not sure if it was how it was intended, but this book read like a youth novel to me, which kind of put me off. YA books are not really my forte, as I prefer my books to have a little more oomph, if you know what I mean. That being said, I did enjoy the book, but I don't know who I would recommend it to. I found that while some parts were written well, with exquisite detail, other parts seemed mashed together and thrown in as an after thought. The cover of the book drives me insane (though that girl is gorgeous!), as the main character is not a goth at all, and it only applies to one scene toward the end of the book. I find the more I think about this book, the more I flip flop back and forth over what I liked, and disliked. I did enjoy the different spin of the vampires and shifters, but leaving it as the 'universe' as being responsible for creating them felt like a cop-out because there was no further explanation of it. I'll give this 3 stars because it has the potential to be something better, and I do think that people that are into Young Adult novels would enjoy it (there is 1 sex scene! sorely lacking, but good enough). I don't think I'll be reading the follow ups to this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it love it love it its better then the other one you just keep on going in one directions this is awesome!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the same type of game as Mario which is cool cause I don't have any other gaming device with this sort of game! I recommend this for all age people who love to play adventure games!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have the kindle version so I really didn't know what I was getting into.I had to read it straight through, Good fast read. The first person narrative is a little weak near the end.<br />Saw the movie which didn't capture the thrill of the chase in the book.
1564029654|5.0|I love this book soooo much.  I've had it since my kids were little and they are in their 20s now.  Luckily I get to read it to the preschoolers I work with as a speech pathologist. It's great for predicting and dealing with missing Mommy issues.  Every time I open it I think of my daughter saying \\"Let's read about Sara! and Percy! and poor! little! helpless Bill!\\"  Love the whole look of the book - charming pictures and dear story.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is a really cute romance/mystery story.  The main character is very interesting and I like watching her transform after the death of her mother who has always been verbally abusive to her.  It made me think about what my \\"wishes\\" might be and whether some of them are more in my grasp than I might think.  Sometimes we forget to live life to it's fullest.  This book reminded me how important it is to do that.  On the mystery side of the story, I enjoyed trying to figure out exactly what was going on.  If you are a die-hard mystery fan, I don't think this would stump you by any bit of the imagination.  Still, the plot was creative and kept you wanting to read.  I wouldn't recommend this for young adult readers because of the physical relationship of the two main characters.  Although I would say, overall this book is fairly clean in that department.  I say give this one a try!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a lot some might be hard for littler kids I think the littler kids would like it though so its pretty good

B005T87QCI|4.0|Its fun. It is hard to control and sometimes it wont do what you say. What's unfair is that when they hit you, you can only block, you cant hit them back, but when your hitting it, they can hit back, which makes it hard to play, because it is impossible to get a combo when they just hit you back, but you cant hit them back.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The title says it all. This is my &quot;go to&quot; for ACCURATE weather. I live in the boonies of WAY northern NY. The only thing missing is the mega-geek weatherman trying to act hip and coolgly woogly trying to tell me how to interpret it. Love the radar and 15day forecasts!
B004L9MFM2|2.0|The second instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire is much slower paced than the first book. The story plods along with very little action and little progression in the story. The only two character stories that held my attention was that of Tyrion and Arya. Both these characters had meaningful story lines and their chapters were a welcome respite from the mundane lives of the other inhabitants. Jon Snow also had a very interesting chapters but sadly there were too few of those. After slogging through three-quarters of the book, suddenly the action picks up and the entire story becomes lively and interesting, finally climaxing with the long awaited battles, whose preparations comprised the bulk of the first 75% of the book. The final quarter is an absorbing read, reminiscent of the first book. I will continue reading the saga and hope the remainder is more in the vein of a Game of Thrones than a Clash of Kings which was tedious to say the least.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I was looking Karaoke system and found this item which i can use with my home theater and can connect additional devices. Use this system in Parties with multiple devices - Laptop, iphone, two mics. Product performance is excellent and give ability to turn off the input by control. Do recommend this product.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I found this book by accident, but I am glad I did! It felt like a true love story. It was dirty, messy, crazy, infatuated love. But, isn't all young love that way? All or nothing love. That is what Abby and Travis have.<br />It is true that at times Travis is almost pathologically obsessive and intense with Abby, but McGuire writes it in a way that makes it endearing rather than scary. I loved it from start to finish. I love that it took them awhile to find their way-I am tired of love stories that seemingly happen in a couple of weeks. That is part of what made this a REAL love story. My only wish is that this was a series rather than a stand alone book. I want more Pidge and Trav!!!
B001NFNFIK|5.0|It could have had more details from the book, more interaction from the wife and child in the story. I think Tommy Lee Jones played Dave really well. A believable character. Entertaining!
0553582038|3.0|I am halfway through and enjoying it as much as the first 3. Many new characters with their own stories while Westeros continues to battle it out.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Support this movie. I've read the John Carter series by Burroughs and there is a tremendous amount of material for future episodes. That being said, I found this movie very entertaining. The Thark character's could have been a little bulkier as portrayed in the books but they still work well for this movie. As for the reviewers, listen to the people who have seen the movie and then judge for yourself. I've found that Critics tend to be less enthused about science fiction and prefer to concentrate their \\"LOFTY Opinions\\" on other genres. Sometime I think they should go on vacation and take in a movie they DON'T Review.
B0062HS03O|5.0|If you're a fan of Lady Gaga's, get this bluray concert. It's awesome, image quality is amazing, the shipping is really fast, I got it delivered on time, perfectly protected buy the packagin, very easy to open.
B004U52VPS|2.0|This \\"real\\" angry bird game is as annoying as the video version. Have you ever played the game on your phone and screamed, \\"I can't believe that didn't fall over?\\" Well the same thing happens here. This should not be marketed as a \\"game\\" rather it should be a \\"playset.\\" Read some of the negative reviews and you'll get a feel for how this \\"game\\" plays out in real life. I can't imagine this game tested well. The buildings take the dexterity of a master Jenga guru to construct and you'd need an engineering degree to figure out the distance and force to make the plastic catapult work.<br /><br />Would it be a fun game for drunk frat guys? No. Would it be a fun game for an angry bird themed youth event? No. But I could see playing it as a solitaire game and removing the rules and the cards. Just stick it on the edge of your desk and launch birds until you feel better about your latest board meeting. Or throw the cards away and just let your kid \\"play\\" with it. I feel bad for the people that paid over $25 for this - especially when the video game is a kajilion times better and it's FREE!
B005TQACLC|5.0|If you love Britney as much as I do, get this bluray!!! you won't regret it. she's back better than ever!! it's worth every pennie I spent! fast shipping and great packaging.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a fun game, great time waster.  Nice that I don't WiFi to play...can play anywhere, even without good signal.
B00466HN72|5.0|I remember seeing the preveiws for Hop back in March 2011. Ive been waiting for DVD/BluRay release of it ever since then. It was worth my wait. My daughters love it and want their own E.B. It is perfect for family movie nights because both young and old will enjoy. Even the bonus features are very entertaining. Goes great in any movie collection.
B0072GPPNC|2.0|To be honest I have not even watched the movie yet, but it gets 3 stars because its a bluray movie in a DVD case. Thus, it will not fit in my Bluray movie rack. What kind of stupid oversight is that?
B0041KKYBA|4.0|As a seasoned 35+ year Banker, this DVD was an absolute revelation !  I intend showing it to my team of senior Bank Managers as a plausible explanation for the Global Financial Crisis.  Hard to believe the almost complete lack of regulation was a root cause, and many of those key players who were asleep at the helm are still there  -  incredible !<br />This DVD is a MUST watch for anyone wanting to know what's behind the biggest economic meltdown of our generation  ...  very well researched and truly brilliant !
0071762345|5.0|I am 40 pages in to this book and let me tell you it makes sense.  It is an easy read that is greatly helping my marketing efforts.  I've been reading everything I can get a hold of and some of the \\"For Dummies\\" books have been good on technical application of marketing but this one takes it to a new level.  There is a lot more explanation of how people think and how to really give you an edge.  If you want an edge this is the book.  Hope the review helps.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are very simple to learn, which is great for smaller kids. However the point system structure makes the games addictive due to their hierarchical design.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I finished CF I started this book right away.This book tells of the rebels trying to take over the captal. With Katniss as mockingjay they are sureto win the war.<br /><br />Sad things:<br />1.Prims death is because of coin<br />2.The squads deaths<br /><br />Happy things:<br />1.Peeta and Katnisses happy ending<br />2.Coin and Snows deaths<br /><br />I think this was the best way to end the trilogy.
B00001U0DP|5.0|FUNNY AND TOUCHING STORY OF HOW A MAN WINS THE HEART OF A WOMAN BY HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND THINGS HE DOES FOR HER
1401937519|5.0|I'm telling everyone I know who is on a spiritual path to read this book!  In fact, I promised to pass on my copy to a friend when I was done, and I just couldn't.  I couldn't part with it.  Dying To Be Me has to be a permanent member of my spiritual library.  (Sorry, Christine.  I'll be sending along your very own copy just as soon as I finish writing this review!)<br /><br />What makes Anita Moorjani's book so different from other near death experience books out there is her ability to describe the indescribable and explain the inexplicable.  I found myself nodding and saying, \\"Oh, I get it now,\\" when she would explain certain spiritual concepts I've never been able to grasp before.<br /><br />And perhaps the most fascinating and important part of the book is Ms. Moorjani's description of how what she learned during her near death experience has impacted her life afterward.  She demonstrates to the reader how spiritual concepts play out in an \\"ordinary\\" life.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.  It changed my life, and I think it will change yours.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|IT'S OK BUT DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR IT A STORY ABOUT A STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL TRYING TO GET HIGH MARKS
B007C3TVNA|4.0|Insightful and nuanced representation of a sociopath and powerful acting by Tilda Swinton in the role of the mother as narrator.  While we know how the story will unfold this is nevertheless a riveting movie.
0345803485|5.0|I saw this book as a bestseller for the week so I figured I'd give it a go. Fell in love & finished the trilogy within 3 days! I'm blown away. This book is written \\"lightly,\\" meaning, there isn't much depth to the writing. So if you're looking for that level of writing, this probably isn't the book for you.<br /><br />However, there is a lot of depth to the story and character (at least, to my imagination). There story plot are somewhat predictable, but it's all exciting nonetheless. This is the perfect book for those of us who enjoys the guilty reading of Twilight. However, Ana, the heroine, seems to be much more of an independent girl as compared to Bella. There are a lot of overlaying plot between the two series, such as: the wealth & face, the \\"dark side\\", the accepting & gorgeous family, the heroine being in danger (all the time) and the Cinderella story of commoner meets special man.<br /><br />The BDSM part is somewhat surprising at first, and then I got used it it, and after a while I grew tired of it I had to skip some paragraphs because of it. But hey, it definitely provides some great ideas for the bedroom ;)<br /><br />Overall, great book for those who wouldn't mind having an independent yet romantically-submissive heroine as the main character!<br /><br />I still can't seem to move on to another book, the intensity this series has put me through... Aaah!
1439152780|5.0|Words can not express how very much I loved this book. I did have to \\"keep up\\", but that is half the fun of the read. I have read Kate's other two books and really did enjoy both of them, however Distant Hours is the best. It is such a treat to see a new writer improve with each book. This story left me hungry for more and yet relieved to be able to breath once I read the last page.  From the first page to the last I was capitvated with family dynamics. I am left speechless to really express my feelings on this book, except to say you must read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivated from beginning to end. I loved this book! I fell in love with the characters and the plot was truly original. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive. some levels are pretty hard but its fun anyways. you should get it! or atleast get the free version. have fun!
B006ON41FC|5.0|i got rhis game when it was the app @of the day ...i mean who would do this game for free????  but i love this game
B006ON41FC|5.0|I played this a lot when I got it and it got a little boring but overall amazing game! everybody should get it!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I heard its fun. but I only did it to get 6 gems on Zoo Story. And I'm still writing cuz I need atleast 13 characters to sumbit. stupid rules and regulations.
0345803485|5.0|This book was fantastic! I could not put ut down, and almost finished it in one day. It is so hard to find modern erotic romance without snipers or vampires or cowboys...I love that this is such an interesting take -a streamlined urban sexy cinderella story with very interesting characters.
1612130283|5.0|Great book.  I am reading the third book of the trilogy.  Hard to put down. Now reading on my Kindle Fire purchased from Amazon.
B00005JPUN|5.0|How many movies have you seen were one by one the people of earth are being taken over by an alien life form?  Probably dozens.  This one however, has a little different twist on the old plot and is fast paced from start to finish. At on point will you feel the story is dragging. Also, Nicole Kidman proves she is more than just a pretty face and shows she is one of Hollywood's most talented actresses.  If you like si-fi and action packed movies you'll like this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Overall, it's a game about aiming.  You use your fingers to slide the slingshot, which has a bird in it (hence the name).  When u let it go, it slings the angry bird across to try and touch or knock something onto one of the evil characters that did something to make the birds angry.  Once something touches them or the bird you sling hits them, they disappear and you get points.  The less birds you use to complete the stage you get more points.  There are a lot of different options for scenarios, so it's not a game to beat so quickly.  I got stuck playing at least 2 hours on that thing. One day out of boredom I started playing. It is addictive cause you get so frustrated when u can't hit the little funny looking green and whatever other characters there.  If you don't kill them all, they give you this annoying grin even though they're bruised but they still grin showing you that you lost.  Some stages seem almost impossible to beat.  Ok I had NO clue what this was until some kids kept asking me if I had Angry Birds?? What? I happen to see it for free so I downloaded it.  I let them play and it kept them busy for a couple of hours. (Thank goodness, a break for me). They decided they wanted Angry Bird Seasons, so they purchased it on my Kindle Fire.  (without my knowledge, so I've now learned how to lock this thing). Download it, it's funny to me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|most excellent free app. I very much enjoyed the graphics and easy controls.<br />would like to see more apps just like this one
B004UID2LC|3.0|its ok you do get too watch free videos and get free music but I have to keep force closing it.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|This is a great DVD and really captures the feel of live music. The musicianship is inspiring. You will enjoy this DVD!
B005COO1X6|3.0|My title says it all.  This story is perfectly fine, but shorter than a typical King short story.  Currently at five bucks, I think this is not worth it and I'd assume it'll appear in a collection sooner or later anyway.  I think the story itself is perfectly OK, but not particularly deep or moving or scary.  Just a typical middle-of-the-road King story.
0345529057|5.0|I absolutely love the series. When I was younger another series I read jad a similar feel, not knowing if a \\"main\\" character was going to die or not.
B0073XORLU|1.0|Let me just start by saying I've deeply appreciated Jethro Tull<br />since I was around 15 years old, and have seen them more than<br />10 times over the years, starting in 1984. I am also a musician,<br />so I believe my appraisal of this album is perceptive.<br />Tull really started to decline in the mid 1990s. It was becoming<br />an Ian solo band, and being a bassist, I thought Jonathan Noyce<br />was simply amateurish. Andy Giddings didn't do much for me either.<br />I actually think David Goodier and John O'Hara are the best<br />bass/keys combo Tull has had in a long time. I saw them live<br />as Tull in 2007, and it was a great show, with Doane Perry and<br />Martin Barre, of course. That Tull band had potential. Yet, instead<br />of nurturing that lineup as the new Tull, Ian tortured it (and himself)<br />with endless, meaningless touring, all over the world. I think the<br />lineup had great potential if they were allowed to get creative as<br />a band. Then, I saw Ian solo in 2010, and the dropoff was so severe<br />I actually left the show. It did nothing for me.<br />TAAB 2 is along those lines. It does not sound like a band at all<br />to me. It sounds like an assembly of trained sheep in Ian's living<br />room, asking the master for permission to bleat and how loudly.<br />This album is a cut-up of poems, not a concept album with flow and<br />direction or purpose. I believe Ian's shortcomings could have been<br />overcome if this was a true Jethro Tull album. It could have had soul.<br />Ian, Martin, Doane, Goodier and O'Hara could have gone into a real<br />studio or rented a hall, and with proper production (perhaps assisted<br />by some contributors to Tull's creative past, like Dee Palmer or another<br />former band member) may have been a worthy new testament to TAAB.<br />Sadly, none of this happened. No wonder Martin and Doane did not participate.<br />Jethro Tull does not exist right now.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Poorly written book from a mans fairy tale perspective about meeting a 22 year old virgin who gives it up within a week. And who also happens to be willing to try s&m because the guy is hot (with red hair(yeah right)). Oh, did I mention the guy, whos 27 himself, is über rich! Total mans fairy tale, all about sex (which can be looked over if the writing wasn't so bad!) lots of money, big wiener, pretty girl, virgin, s&m and no commitment in the first book. Give me a break. I almost didn't finish the book.
B002BWP49C|4.0|This was a great movie, the only thing it was really missing was more action, but it was more about the honeymoon and baby. Can't wait for the next installment, its going to be great...I can tell from this ending. A must buy.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|I've seen Phantom live three times over the years. It's always special. For Phantom lovers I think this is a must-own DVD. The production is simply spectacular and the end - after the play - alone is worth the price, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I simply can't imagine anyone not thinking this is great.
092389165X|3.0|A classic, worth reading.  Really conveys the terror and bewilderment after the bomb was dropped.  Interesting study of various characters involved.  Feel does not put the bombing into perspective...ultimately saved American and Japanese lives.  Agree with other reviewers that may be too apologetic. At the same time makes a nice case for nuclear restraint.  Easy to read in 1-2 days as was originally a magazine article.
B007Q476KU|5.0|I saw War Horse at the theater. I immediately fell in love with Joey, the horse. Also, I was positively amazed at the quality of the movie. I mean the makers of this movie took a children's novel and turned it into a grand epic. That is such a difficult task to accomplish. The scenery was stunning. This movie is a work of art. You must see it.

B0056K4VRM|5.0|To quote KUSC's sagacious Jim Svejda. And again, \\"an enduring monument (that is, Walter's mostly late '50s recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra) to one of the greatest twentieth-century conductors.\\"<br /><br />At over six hours of magnificent and varied (and 24 bit) Mozart for roughly 20 bucks as of this writing, this set is a steal.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

1433502410|5.0|The ESV Study Bible has been such a blessing to my life. I praise the Lord for the work He has done through the many people involved on the project.    I have had the opportunity to use the ESV Study Bible in my academic life as a student at a bible college, for personal study, and at church (the pastor in our church switched to using the ESV as the primary version a few months ago). In every aspect of my life the ESV Study Bible has been wonderful.    As you could easily see pictures of what the Bible looks like, I will not go into a detailed description, but I would like to comment on the quality since so many people have received copies with printing defects. I have now owned three ESV Study Bibles and have been very fortunate that all three of them have been devoid of any printing or manufacturing errors. The first two I owned were the hardcover edition. I lost the first one and I hope God is using it to bless the life of whoever found it. The second hardcover one served me well for two years at bible college. It is still very usable and in good overall condition, but the \\"hard covers\\" are starting to come away from the binding. Thus I decided to get the Portfolio TruTone edition. I have had this one for 4 months now and couldn't be happier with it. If you are concerned that you may receive a copy with a printing defect I would suggest that you go to your local Christian bookstore (if their prices aren't outrageous) so you can easily return / exchange a defective copy.    My newest ESV Study Bible has the newest revision of the ESV released in 2011. The first two had the 2007 text edition. There very few differences in these editions of the ESV. Here is a link to an interesting video of the committee debating the word \\"slave\\" as used in the 2007 edition:    [...]    I realize this is a physically big and heavy bible and many do not want to take this with them everywhere. In my opinion these resources are worth lugging around to class, church, and anywhere else...but many would disagree with me on that. Be aware that there is a personal-sized edition. I have not used this for myself, but I have seen it in the stores and it looks a lot more portable. If I am correct, the personal-size is pretty much the same but it saves space by removing many of the articles found in the back. If you decide to go that route you will still have access to the articles at esvonline.org and will be able to access them anywhere you have an internet connection.    This study bible is an amazing resource and is a tool that everyone should be equipped with. I would highly recommend this to anyone! Please don't go another day without this resource! God will use this tool to immensely bless your life!

B003EYVXV4|4.0|This story takes place in the future where a repressive government forces its relentless will upon the common people. This story takes place after a post-apocalyptic war. In the nation of Panem there is a rich capital city that is the center of the government which is surrounded by 12 districts which are poor and are forced to work hard for a meager life. All of their efforts are to support the grander and greed of the capital city residents. Every year the government forces a lottery style draft to select one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 to 18 to fight in a battle until only one survives. This nationally televised event is to show all the 12 districts that the government is totally in charge and the one survivor is a symbol of a weak but meager hope for a better life.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a master hunter and marksman with a bow and arrow. When her young 12 year old sister is selected to go to battle she quickly and bravely volunteers to take her place and she is accepted. She and her male lottery winner are taken to the capital city to train and be judged as to their abilities....<br /><br />What follows is a story of desperation of the games participants and the evils of a corrupt government are exposed to the viewers. The totalitarian government basically has a slave population that works to provide the economical and material needs of the rich citizens while maintaining absolute control and a police state to manage the people.<br /><br />Katniss's performance in the games overwhelms the people of the districts and shows that there is another way of life and that love and compassion for others is the best way to a happy life and not being a slave. This movie is rock solid and the acting is superb. Jennifer Lawrence as the protagonist does a wonderful job portraying Katniss and she simply makes the movie.<br /><br />The special effects are good and Katniss's skill and beauty motivate and inspire the other citizens to want and have more. You will like this movie and want to read the book as well as go to the next movie in the sequel. I would really rate this movie as 4 ½ stars but it is either 4 or five as the selections.

1439102813|5.0|\\"Still Alice\\" is a book that was given to me by a dear friend. Shortly afterwards, she asked if I had read it yet. She wanted to know what I thought because she had so thoroughly enjoyed this heart-wrenching novel and wanted to know my opinion of it. I had a couple of books already on the go so I hadn't had the chance to get to it just yet. Besides, I knew I had a plane trip coming up and I wanted a good book to read enroute. I not only found \\"Still Alice\\" to be a good book, I found it to be absolutely captivating and extremely powerful in its effort to depict the story of a 50 year old woman diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. I read it on the plane, between connecting flights and into the next flight. I could not put it down. It actually brought me to tears at times and forced me to face the devastating, debilitating, and oftentimes, misunderstood disease of Alzheimer's.<br /><br />First-time novelist, Lisa Genova, manages to get right into the heart, soul and mind, of a well-educated, intelligent woman, Dr. Alice Howland, and share what she is going through every step of the way. Her painful journey is written in such a way that it is impossible to not feel for every member of the family as they learn to live with this crippling, terrifying, and tragic disease that can be genetically transmitted. The most profound realization is that Alzheimer's can strike anyone at any given time. It does not matter how intelligent, educated, gifted or famous any one person is...it can creep up on the most unsuspecting person and sink it's ugly teeth into that life and the lives of those surrounding the afflicted person. What I found so emotionally touching is the love and devotion that Dr. Alice Howland could still feel toward her family. She may not have recognized them at the end of the novel but she could still feel their love as well. Bottom line, I think it is this love that makes her life worth living!

0385535139|5.0|I realize that the last few reviews I've written (for books by other authors) have been negative, so I decided to find a book worthy of a 5 star review. This is it. As always, I am amazed at Grisham's ability to shape characters that are 3 dimensional, endearing, intelligent and interesting; and develop plot lines that keep the reader enthralled from page one to the final word. This is another in a long line of terrific novels. If I were stranded on a desert island and could bring only 3 things - they would be a kindle, a wifi connection, and - oh never mind - I'd just bring John Grisham and let him spin another mesmerizing tale!

1451648537|4.0|Isaacson does a generally wonderful job, although the pace does falter at bit at the end.  And being an \\"original\\" Mac fan, there are some noticeable omissions.  Aroiund 1998, Apple had issued a dual motherboard computer that was it's first step in wooing those who had to use the PC for work, but love Apple - i.e. like me.  This product, which was a flop is not even mentioned in one sentence.  The book just jumps to the IPod.  Okay, a somewhat glaring omission for a biography that attempts to map out the trials and tribulations of Apple.<br /><br />Also, there are some editing errors - a sign that the book was rushed out?<br />p. 127-128 \\"he became particularly attracted to the Japanese style...hanging out with its stars, such as Issey Miyake and I.M.

I have Isaacson's biography on Kissinger which I haven't started yet.  Hopefully that wasn't also a rush job.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid (2-3 books a week) reader of mostly romance novels but find myself sometimes seeking a change or simply want to see what is on the top sellers list----this is how I found Fifty Shades of Grey. I raised my eyes when I read that it contained elements of BDSM but relented due to the reviews. I love a good book so... I wanted to know what was all the fuss. Boyo-boy. The first time I read the F--word come out of Christian mouth I was hooked. Hummm, what actually hooked me was probley the shock of it all and although I have read far explicit books-this book simply was beyound erotic, it was an all consuming romance of discovery. Both main characters, Christian and Anatasia, were a joy to get to know throughout the three books (oh yes, you will buy the others without a doubt). Christian with his fifty shades of f--ed-upness will have bitting your nails, rolling your eyes, and hopelessly waiting for more details of his early life; a life that has made him seek to tightly control all aspects of his exsistance even in the bedroom where submissives can be controlled-literally. Anatasia changes all of that. As readers, we will find out (eventually in three books) what has driven Christian to seek this kind of release-control and what no other character but Anatasia(innocent and unworldly) that would bring about the discovery of each others' all consuming need (love) for the other even with the shades of grey. I loved the- Oh my, I loved the eye rolling (the consequences of also), I loved the inner goddess, I loved music, I loved the Audi's, and I loved this book!!! E.L. James, you hit this one out of the park--period ;)

B002ZG97LK|1.0|Oh, I had a hard time with this movie. I heard it was nothing like the original, but it wasn't even in the same league as the original footloose. I'm not one who doesn't like movies redone, because I do, and footloose was one of my favorite movies as a teen, but this one irritated me so bad. So, instead of the tractor race, they have a school bus race on a track. The amazing scene in the first one where he dances all over the empty warehouse was terrible. The music for the most part was terrible. They had some original, but not much. I was so disapointed in this movie. There was some great dancing, but not even enough to make it worth the 15 bucks I paid for this. What a complete bummer. I wish I would've read reviews before purchasing.

0307939693|5.0|I've been fortunate enough to do a fair amount of traveling.  I love trying new places at least once.  It's harder to have a true cultural experience these days.  You really have to go off the beaten path.  With Costco in Cabo, Starbucks in Shanghai and KFC in Kuala Lumpur, one wonders if there will be anything left of culture when we are done consumerizing the world.  (yes, I know that's not a word.)<br /><br />Obviously, we can't all trot off to North Korea to have a truly meaningful cultural experience - what we get instead is this masterful novel, brilliantly told by Adam Johnson.<br /><br />I will admit, at first I wondered what all the hullaballoo was about.  I listened on audio, and found the beginning a little bit slow.  After I got over the hump, I was utterly fascinated.  I feel like I really learned a lot about North Korea, the people and the former \\"dear leader.\\"  The audio was really well done with three different readers who's voices were well-suited to their roles.<br /><br />This novel has a unique structure, and what Johnson did so well was expose the differences in our cultures in a way that felt very natural.  It's almost like you need to forget everything you know going into this book.  And try to imagine a place where people are astounded by the fact that in America they have companies which make food in cans - just for dogs!<br /><br />It was thought provoking, and definitely would make for interesting discussion.  If you didn't know any better, wouldn't you really believe you lived in the worlds more democratic nation?<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />edited to add:  there's video of the author speaking about this novel, and it's really interesting.  It can be found on In One Eye, Out the Other.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I read the first installment in Martin's epic series and I can say the mini series is remarkably faithful to the book.  A couple of scenes have been invented for television, but they do not detract from the impact of the story. In fact, they enhance the subtext quite a bit, especially if you haven't read the book.  Great cast, the visuals, especially in HD, are amazing and they really capture the atmosphere of the books.  Great job all around! Highly recommended!!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I came to this book in the most weird way, drawn to it by the awesome narrative.  One day, reading a book on leadership by John Maxwell, I found a famous quote about a lion and a gazelle, which I knew, but did not know that it was attributed to Roger Bannister.  This prompted me to re-visit the Bannister entry on Wikipedia, which linked to a Washington Post page excerpting Chapter 1 of the book.<br /><br />That sampler was enough to buy it. So good is, in my opinion, McDougall's narrative.  I had not read anything from him before, but this book has a great story to tell, and does so in a way that hijacks your imagination.  I was not aware, until after reading it, that it weighs in at about 280 pages.  It surprised me a lot, given that I went through it on one day from 6 PM to about 2 AM and then 10 AM to 2 PM the next day.  It was that good a read to me.<br /><br />Something I appreciated is that, even though you may get an impression that some racy bits (of the sexual kind) are given away in the product descriptions, the book doesn't dwell deeply at all in those subjects.  It is a passionate story that stands on its own without having to resort to artificial topics outside its main subject to keep the reader engaged.  I really value that.<br /><br />Other than the literary qualities, McDougall puts his research journalism skills to good use and comes up with some very thought-provoking and even defying statements.  If you have, like me until a few months ago, been hesitant against running because you read or were told that we humans are not meant to, this book may shake your ground a little bit.  Or a lot.  Going as far as exposing scientific evolutionary evidence for the fact that we are not only able, but actually supposed to run, you'll see many interesting ideas that should at least put some doubt in your mind about running, our capabilities about it, and the importance and endurance of its benefits (not just physical) beyond what seems to be a fad or fashion that comes and goes every so often.<br /><br />I am not able to test the book's theories about running right now, as I recently suffered some back problems (casued by my sedentary lifestyle, apparently...) and have been told not to run for now.  But I must confess whatever little desire of running I might have had before reading this book has now grown explosively, and I look forward to enjoy that outcome as much as, or more than, I enjoyed getting pumped up about it in the first place.  Well worth your ten or so bucks!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Finally, an album that I can listen to all the way through! Over the past few months, the Lumineers quickly became my new go-to. It's just pleasant music w/ great melodies and interesting depth. About half of this album is a more polished version of the EP and the other half is new songs. If I had to characterize The Lumineers, I'd say they're similar to Bright Eyes, except 10 times better and a tenth as annoyingly self-infatuated. I have yet to find someone who doesn't like this music.

B005LAIH9A|4.0|It's hard to believe that American Wedding came out in 2003 and that there's a nine year gap between that movie and the latest installment American Reunion. I guess I was never that big of a fan of the first three movies. The first one was pretty good, but the two sequels were just kind of okay. They do probably deserve a revisit, but I was always more of a Van Wilder and Harold & Kumar fan. It's weird saying that because American Pie paved the way for not only those R-rated comedies, but basically every other one since then. Much like the characters in the movie, we've all grown up and moved on since Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) wedding. Maybe that's why there wasn't much anticipation on my end for American Reunion. That's kind of the beauty of the theatrically released American Pie movies; you always seem to under-anticipate them and they always deliver something that's better than you ever could have hoped for.<br /><br />American Reunion begins with the same scene that's at the beginning of the trailer and plays out in a similar fashion to that of Not Another Teen Movie's opening sequence, but with more member-crushing. Jim, Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have plans to reunite in East Great Falls, Michigan for a guy's weekend before their thirteenth high school reunion. Everyone has moved on and either has a family now or an incredible job in another city except for Stifler (Seann William Scott) who's now a single temp at a law firm. With cameos and small roles for nearly every character you've grown to love over the span of the franchise, this is one weekend these friends will remember and cherish forever.<br /><br />American Reunion offers this huge slice of nostalgia as it seems like you know and have grown up along with these characters. While the raunchiness is still very much alive and well and results in some of the most memorable moments ever (the kitchen scene and Stifler getting back at the teenagers at the lake), American Reunion has just as much sentimental value as it does obscene humor. There's just as much emphasis on new and old relationships, drama between characters, and everlasting friendship that there is on jokes involving male genitalia and fecal matter. Some of the best moments of the movie are between Jim and his dad (Eugene Levy). They juggle between being really touching and downright hilarious due to their awkwardness.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (writers/directors of the three Harold & Kumar movies) came on board that American Reunion feels like a bit of a step up for the franchise. Well, anything probably is after the direct to DVD sequels. It almost seems like American Reunion manages to return to its roots while also offering a little bit more in the emotional department. It could just be I related to the movie since I often feel like I'm running in place career-wise much like these characters and that all my friends seem to be moving on and having families while I don't, but that only adds to the fact that this is a really entertaining adult comedy. American Reunion is downright hysterical at times and unexpectedly reflective at others.t the teenagers at the lake), American Reunion has just as much sentimental value as it does obscene humor.

B0079KKJ3M|3.0|Back in the mid 70s when I discovered Olivia Newton-John, I had no idea she'd done the movie Toomorrow. Over the next few years, she'd refer briefly to the 'terrible' film that had been released in 1970, prefering to concentrate on talking about terrible films she was currently making. Such as Xanadu and Two Of A Kind! It was understandable that given Olivia's huge US success she'd rather the movie just slip away from public consciousness, but was Toomorrow really that bad?<br /><br />No, of course not. It's not great, for sure, but is bright and peppy and the cast are young and attractive, especially ONJ who is noticably spunkier here than she was to become down the line. The dialogue is awful and the 'group' often seem like they've just met for the first time due to the stilted talking patterns. The songs aren't great either but are pretty 60s-ish pop fluff with Olivia's vocals standing out. The plot is dreadful but so are a lot of movies but they don't get shunted into a vault for 40 years!<br /><br />The making of and subsequent failure of Toomorrow at the box office would make for a fascinating documentary, but it isn't on this DVD. I doubt there ever will be one with producer Don Kirshner, writer and director Val Guest along with 2 of the group members all dead. But this is the least of this DVD's troubles...<br /><br />I'd previously only seen the Japanese subtitled VHS copy which was largely unwatchable, so it saddens me to say that this 2012 DVD version isn't much better. Actually, it's OK to begin with but as the film wears on the missed frames and picture freezes become more abundant. Indeed, the last 20 minutes are so bad I begin to wonder if I had a dud copy. It's a shame as the final number, one of the visual highlights, is all but ruined by the aforementioned problems.<br /><br />There are no extras. There's barely a menu! So I can't really give the Toomorrow DVD anymore than three stars. If you don't own it I'd say get it but don't expect too much in terms of picture quality.

B003YUU62U|5.0|This shoe is not made of plastic like most of the other crocks. It's a type of canvas and has a super no slip bottom.  They are so light it is literally comparable to being barefoot.  The padding in the shoe is better the any \\"air\\" shoe I have owned.  There is one problem though, no half sizes. I usually wear a 10 1/2 and I read from other reviews that if you attempt to wear socks with them its too tight. I ordered a size 11 and they are just a bit to big when my socks are on, however, I still chose to wear these over any other shoe I have. I believe that a size 10 would have been too small with socks so keep that in mind when ordering, and thats something you should do right now. Lastly, they look very nice with jeans and stand out as looking like nice expensive shoes.
B005T87QCI|3.0|The game would be awesome if you could play as Atom,Zeus, and Twin city's and was longer it would be the best darn game ever. I'm only twelve and am on my nookcolor Wichita I booted to android.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm always skeptical starting a m/f book, whether YA or adult, because I'm afraid I'll hate the heroine since I'm not overly fond of females characters.<br /><br />With Clary, I ended up liking her, thankfully. It helps she's a ginger and I have a soft spot for gingers. But aside from that, she was a typical teenage girl. Bratty and snappish at times but still likable in how she's willing to risk her life to find her mom. Jace is entirely different in how he's pretty much closed himself off to being weakened by emotions such as love and caring, at least that's what he projects. He's probably one of the most arrogant characters I've ever read and he's only like 16 years old. I liked the fact that Clary shakes things up for Jace, though, she causes a lot of problems that lead to a lot of danger. I loved the secondary characters, too. Alec, Magnus, Isabelle, Simon and Luke were all interesting and the parts they played in the book.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into details about the plot but I will say this story has a lot of suspense. Because of the dilemma Clary is in and what she's learning she's put into a lot of dangerous situations that result in injuries for pretty much everyone but her. I loved the world she's just now becoming a part of. It was fascinating and intriguing whenever a new Downworlder would be told about or would show up. There are a few intense encounters that had me wanting to bite my nails and a few shocking moments when all I could do was stare in disbelief. I'm still in disbelief, actually, and desperately wanting to know if something is true or not.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book a lot, I still had some problems. The beginning was a bit slow for me. It didn't catch my attention right away but once I read for a while I got suckered in. Another thing was I thought Clary was more than a bit selfish. She didn't generally think about how her actions affected other people. Then there's the fact that whenever she put other people in danger,she never actually helped to save them, just kind of stood there and let things happen. The only time she fought was when she was actually being attacked. That irked me because people could have died and it seemed like she'd have just let it happen.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed the story very much. I love the world, the characters and the direction the story is going in. While this ends on a semi-cliffhanger, it is not so severe that you don't have questions answered. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series ASAP.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love the games!!! its like a version of mario but with different characters and enemies:) works great on the kindle fire
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I was never a Cate Blanchett fan until now..This movie will take you back in time and give you a sense of what it was truly like in this era. Such an empowering performance by Cate..This movie will bring you to your knees! This is now one of my favorite films. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|John Carpenter's [[ASIN:B001CW7ZWG The Thing  [Blu-ray]]] was an example of a worthwhile remake.  It captured a certain paranoia of the times, made some oblique social commentary and applied a relatively decent budget to an essentially B movie story.  In particular, it showed visually a creativity in effects which had not been seen before - notable for their shot in-camera reality.<br />This time round, we have the same B-movie story retrod.  Although it is a prequel, telling the story from the Norwegian camp that Kurt Russell and co. visit in the Carpenter version, it hits many of the same beats - the twist on the blood test scene is interesting, for example.  However, we never quite get into the characters or atmosphere of the camp in the way that Carpenter set up, and certainly the tension is never generated in the same way.  There are no shocks and surprises, other than the cheap `make a loud noise to give the audience a jump' type, mostly because the film eschews the sense of distrust caused by a creature that only reveals itself when forced to.. here the creature seems to appear at the drop of a hat.  The effects are (mostly) CG this time round, which I assumed would rob them of their real-feel bite.. and yet, they have stuck closely to the aesthetics of the original so the CG-ness is played down in a way that does them credit.  Although the characters never feel particularly well defined, the cast do their best - Mary Elizabeth Winstead is actually satisfyingly low key and unshowy, and comes across almost Ripley-like in her ability to rise to the challenge, particularly in the final scenes, which edge away from the genre in the direction of sci-fi.  The rest of the cast all look convincing, but we don't feel we know them enough to care much what happens.<br />All in all, not a disaster then.. just oddly irrelevant and unnecessary.  It's not badly done, one just ends up wondering why do a remake / reimagining / prequel if you don't have anything new to bring to the table?  It's exciting enough, and well put together, but  feels perhaps a little too familiar.  If there are people out there who have not seen the previous version, this will doubtless seem just fine.  To those who have seen Carpenter's version, this is a non-essential retread.
0307956350|1.0|The plot had the potential to be very interesting, but the writing is poorly organized and incredibly confusing.  He jumps from time and place abruptly, leaving the reader guessing which scene is being played. All he needed was to put a city name and date stamp at the transition points to give the reader a clue that the setting has changed.  Also, an abundant misuse of the comma makes the writing clumsy.<br /><br />Why so many great reviews? His wife is a senior exec at Random House and former Amazon exec. Great marketing makes up for a mediocre product.

B006UG90RM|3.0|First, I must preface this review by admitting that although I now have a varied musical taste, my favorites are stuck in the 80s.  I was around when Van Halen headlined the US Festival in California.  I wanted the red and white overalls like Eddie Van Halen.  I even tied multiple bandanas down the leg of my jeans like DLR in my teens.  All that silly stuff was cool then.  It was when music dictated a way of life - mullet and all.  So I like songs that fulfill my nostalgia.<br /><br />Given my nostalgic thirst, I don't know what to think about this \\"album\\" (or CD, MP3, etc.)  I'm glad to hear DLR's voice with VH again.  But was the background voice in the chorus a little lacking or was it just me?  I loved the 80's VH with the blend of DLR's voice and the melodic background-voice in the chorus (e.g. \\"Hear About it Later,\\"  etc.)  I didn't find it here.  It's straight up DLR overshadowing any VH background vocals.<br /><br />Then for the \\"album\\" itself, VH always had a tune that stuck way out as the most catchy song of the set.  You know, you get \\"And the Cradle will Rock,\\"  and despite all the other great tunes on Women and Children First, you say \\"And the Cradle will Rock\\" was the tune.  There was nothing like that here.  Yeah, \\"Tattoo\\" was good, but it didn't really stick out.  This album may grow into me.  But with all the other VH of the late 70s - 80s DLR days, I didn't really need this \\"growing into\\" period.  Don't know if it's just my ears stuck in 80s expectation or what, but that's how I feel.  Nevertheless, I'm glad DLR is back with VH where he belongs because without him, VH - \\"You're No Good.\\"  With DLR, \\"Everybody Wants Some.\\"

0439023521|3.0|This action-packed thriller lacks the background and character development to give substance to its narrative.  The author devotes 75% of the book to the thrill of the hunt, the predator-prey relationships, the cold calculating strategies and dynamics of the kill, but only 10% to the cultural setting and background of a society so desperate and so degenerate as to obediently sacrifice its children to suffering, torture, and death in a nationally-televised gladiator super bowl.  The author devotes not more than 15% of the book to the interplay of human emotions, such as empathy, fear, anger, trauma, desperation, and self-sacrifice that one would expect to explore in greater depth for a better understanding of the culture.  Too many questions are left unanswered.  Why are the children so cooperative in the preparation for their slaughter?  Why are their parents so submissive?  Why, with few exceptions involving the main characters, are the children described as hardened soldiers devoid of conscience or emotion as they go about slaughtering each other?  Why is there no mention of rebellion within the districts, and why do the districts police themselves so harshly if they aren't occupied by standing armies from the federal capital?  The reader is left with an empty shell, a top-heavy narrative with the action and adventure of Steven Spielberg's \\"Jaws,\\" but with the background and character development of \\"The Three Bears.\\"<br /><br />In literary comparison this book is dwarfed by the rich prose of Margaret Mitchell's epic \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" that takes the reader deep into southern culture; and by the strong cultural setting and impassioned emotional development of the television miniseries \\"Roots\\" based on Alex Haley's novel about a family's struggle under the tyranny of slavery in the old South; and by the gripping triumph of the human spirit so vividly expressed in the American drama film \\"Stand and Deliver,\\" based on the true story of high school math teacher Jaime Escalante who overcame all odds to teach calculus to reluctant students in an environmentally unfriendly high school district of East Los Angeles.<br /><br />The ancient Greek aphorism \\"Know thyself\\" applies more to the reader than to the author or the narrative.  So what in this story appeals most to you?  You can think about it.me Escalante who overcame all odds to teach calculus to reluctant students in an environmentally unfriendly high school district of East Los Angeles.<br /><br />The ancient Greek aphorism \\"Know thyself\\" applies more to the reader than to the author or the narrative.

B006OAB2XO|4.0|Claire Boucher's (Grimes) streamlined approach to making music isn't particularly sui generis in the 2010's, many artists are frequently being described as ecclectic now, but few are able to construct a distinctive aesthetic out of the disparate influences they peddle. Thats the main strengh of this album, the songs on here have elements of familiarity but neither of them feel indebted to a particular era. Take Genesis, it features looped piano notes, oriental sounds, hi hat cymbals, electronic beats and Claire's playfully childlike vocals, which are all introduced within the first 30 seconds of the song and then alternated in various forms throughout it's 4 minute playing time. It sounds a little sporadic on paper, but it works really well by not just offering you a cornucopia of delights but introducing these elements at just the right time to keep you engaged and eager to see what's coming next.<br /><br />Be A Body is another obvious treat too, with it's electro ambient permutations and Boucher's sweetly synthetic falsetto, sending you off to some futuristic utopia. The rest of the album juggles similar sounds in different ways like Oblivions employment of noises you might find in an arcade somewhere in the early 90's. Than there's Nightmusic's snippets of neoclassical sounds that are neatly interwoven with the ambient synts and piano loops that are found all over this album. This music won't be for everybody i hasten to add and even though i'm fond of it, i found Grimes delicate patchwork of sounds to be a little too cutesy and adorable at times leaving some of the songs on here sounding merely pleasant and a little forgettable. Nevertheless i still found this a charming foray into a pop wonderland that felt pleasently familiar yet refreshingly novel, if your an electro pop fan it's definitely worth giving this a listen as your likely to really enjoy this.

B00006GA4C|5.0|I've owned Grand Funk's Greatest Hits for years, but for some reason never bothered to explore their early albums. What time wasted! I'm a huge Cream fan, and this second album of Grand Funk is right down that alley! It's no secret that critics have always bashed these guys, and their musicianship and songwriting is not quite on the level of Cream or Led Zeppelin, but it's still great stuff! These guys could still play their butts off, and Mark Farner is a great singer! The only well-known cut off this album is Inside Looking Out, but the whole album is in the same style as that song. So any fan of Cream, Hendrix and early Zeppelin will appreciate this great album--at least I know I do!
B001NLKWLW|3.0|This book is a good one over all. I couldn't rate it higher because it had parts that I struggled to get through to get to the next good part. I liked the beginning and thought it was real interesting. After that it got a little slow in parts and then got interesting again. Maybe it was just the story style. I liked the authors writing for the most part but this book took me a long time to finish. So I liked it but it was a little slow moving for me. The parts set in 1913 were better for me than the parts set in 2005. I still would try another book by this author.

0345803485|2.0|Good fan fiction if your into PWP stories. (Porn without Plot - used for over a decade with fanfiction writers).  Can see all the Twilight characters in this, and it reads just like a fan fiction - very little character depth and Christian is so inconsistent its ridiculous.  I got thru 75% and finally had to go read a real book.  Very glad for her success though.  How in the heck they paid 5 million for the movie rights is beyond me though...  why??<br /><br />I PROPOSE A DRINKING GAME:  for every \\"gasp\\", have a shot.  If you read the whole book, you will be in the emergency room.<br /><br />For every \\" biting lip\\" comment - have a shot.  you will be drunk in a chapter.  Any chapter.<br /><br />For every \\"he is so bossy\\" comment, roll your eyes, spank your partner, have a shot.<br /><br />Instead of a viral video - this has turned into a viral book.  Is it worth the 10 dollars?  Guys - buy it for your wife/girlfriend and see....
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut, Ten, is a great introduction from this great Legendary band.<br />  I think Eddie Vedder's voice shines on songs like 'Why go'. He sings this songs in an amazing raspy, angry voice.<br />  The song Jeremy is an awesome but sad song.It is about bullying gone wrong.<br />  The most amazing song on this cd, is 'Black'. This is a classic. You must check this out if you haven't heard of it. It would be on my top ten list, if i had to make one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great job making this game its awesome and I love the real time aspect it revoulves around its great just great
0385535139|4.0|I listened to the audio version of this book in my car and was, to my surprise, thoroughly entertained.  The narrator is Dennis Boutsikaris and he does an excellent job capturing Grisham's playful and somewhat sardonic tone throughout the novel.  As a retired litigator, I am sensitive to the creative license some writers employ to elevate the drama of courtroom-based fiction.  In this case, however, Grisham keeps it admirably real.  If you're in need of something to entertain you while you exercise or drive, I can recommend the audio version of this book without reservation.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|... as hard as it might be for some to admit.  This is why I think this show has so much appeal...serial killers have been the subject of much fascination over time and this is the only show that has attempted the answer the question \\"How could someone do this?\\"<br /><br />And the audience can relate to him for a vareity of common challenges: he craves a sense of belonging, has a broken family, adopts family values as a moral code, struggles with addiction, feels different and feels alone.  He even dislikes in others what he sees in himself.  He is scarred, haunted by his past and trying to discover who he really is and why he does what he does.<br /><br />Dexter represents the dark side of human nature...a side that most people are afraid of on one had, wanting to explore and still like who we are at the end of the day.<br /><br />We can relate to Dexter because he goes after what makes him feel good....so many people do what is not good for them or good for others because it satisfies some basic desire to feel good.  The difference with Dexter is *what* makes him feel good, and because what he needs to do is so against society's values.  It's an interesting question: what would the common person do if killing made them feel good, satisfied some basic instinct?  Would we really be that much different?<br /><br />It's a fascinating character study that has never been done before quite like this.  A phenomenal show, and unbelieveably addicting.

0345803485|1.0|This book is terrible. It has all the depth of a driver's manual but with not much of the fun. I found that I was irritated almost from page one with her use of repetitive phrases and I failed to \\"feel\\" the attractive tension between the main characters.  The book is one clich&eacute; after another, even their names are pseudo-Victorian.  I don't see what all the hype is about and as a result, do not recommend this book at all.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this app is pretty fun; if you like Mario brothers you'll like this game. its a little bit hard to control but you get used to it eventually. works great on kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read, that is if I am able to finish reading it. I work in a book store and women have been coming in asking about this book. I figured I should check it out so I can advise customers when we finally have some copies. I will actively be advising people not to buy it. There are so many flaws in it, but I will restrict myself to mentioning one; the author clearly doesn't understand the meaning of the word \\"subconscious.\\"
1612130283|2.0|I saw this book on a morning show, and the women on the panel thought it was the greatest modern romance ever.  I tried it, but it was a little much for me.  My husband will forever tease me with \\"I know you'd rather be reading your porn, but can you\\" change a diaper, grab groceries, put the kids' shoes on, etc. I finished it, but I don't think I can take another two installments of Mr. Grey, Miss Steele, and all their graphic escapades.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only is this a fabulous source of multiple translations, but the study guides make it easy to choose a plan and stick with it. If the idea of reading the Bible cover to cover is overwhelming, let this app break it into manageable pieces and help keep you on track.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I have watched this awesome movie on Starz 4 times so far, 3 times within the last 24 hours. My 8yr old grandaughter and I just watched it over and over, she said lets watch it again grandma. I love the movie and music so much that I cry every time I see and hear it. I have so much faith and believe in Gods power, I have believed in God and always known his love. And I believe without a doubt that if Bethaney didn't believe in Jesus Christ and know him through her faith that this movie probably never would have been made. This is a film that is for all of us  I am proud and grateful to see such a movie that is not afraid to show real life, love, tragedy, and most of all that Jesus Christ pulled this young family through it, to realize that truly With God All Things Are Possible. My grandaughter loved it, I'm going to purchase it for my collection  You can't believe what alot of critics say, that may speak negatively about this movie, for it is them who are mere men or women, who may not believe in our Heavenly Father, who may not be a Solider for God, make up your own mind, don't be a follower of those who lead you away from Jesus Christ. This movie will give you Hope,Faith, Encouragement, Lift your Spirit, Touch your Soul.  This movie shows that  Jesus Christ Love is bigger and more powerful than ANYTHING!!!

B00708L34C|5.0|So, I've listened to this so many times that the songs are embedding themselves into my consciousness. Not a dud among 'em, though the ones that resonate the most are \\"Gravedigger's Song\\", \\"Riot In My House\\", \\"Ode to Sad Disco\\", \\"Phantasmagoria Blues\\", \\"Quiver Syndrome\\", \\"Deep Black Vanishing Train\\", and \\"Tiny Grain of Truth\\". (Um, that's most of them!) Others have posted more comprehensive reviews, but I'm going to stop now before I start gushing. If you're like me and can't get enough of the man's gorgeous voice, you don't need my review to make you buy this album because you already have it!
B000KOZMUE|5.0|I received this flash last week and I am using the flash on my Nikon CoolPix P7100.  This small flash is powerful beyond my expectations.  I generally us this in the bounce mode indoors.  This adds depth and separation from the backround making the subject stand out and not look flat on a print.  I also use it outside in the sunlight and it removes any ugly shadows from faces, whether the shot be close or from a distance....I am really impressed and highly recommend this flash.

B0073XORCY|5.0|I am finding it hard to understand the negative reviews on this release.  This is the most exciting release from Ian Anderson or Jethro Tull in a number of years.  It grows on you from listen to listen not unlike older Tull releases. I have been a fan of Tull for 40 plus years and was at the Thick As A Brick show.  With each spin of TAAB2 I find new things I did not hear the last play.  Kismet In Suburbia, A Change Of Horses and Adrift and Dumfounded together are worth the price of the disc.  I like it so much that I am going to get the 2 disc version now.  Very recommeded from an old Tull fan.
1416583432|2.0|Wow! I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read and provide insight into my best friends (I have two great dogs). What I found was a dry, clinical look at dog psychology. The read was not only dry but also not the least bit fun. If you are a college student looking to have a career as dog psychologist then this book is for you. The author is intelligent but, sadly not an entertaining writer. She should stick to writing textbooks. I was very disappointed.
0385335482|4.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Kinsella and it was Shopoholic that did it to me. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c Becky, our heroine, is at times annoying and childish but that is the point of the series. Becky is a character you can relate to, despite her tactics. She's a character I've followed through the several shopoholic books and want to know that in the end she will be ok. This book is hilarious. Kinsella is great at incorporating womenspeak into her novels and this one is the one that started it all.<br /><br />Becky is working in a financial magazine yet her finances are completely out of control. She meets Luke, a charming dreamlike guy and the adventure begins. Will Becky be outted for being a fraud? Will she get her finances under control? And what will Luke think when he finds out about her little shoe addiction? Well pick it up b/c you will be so glad you did. It's chick lit at its finest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a good balance of easy and hard games. it is fun to sit back and play during a spare hour.
044024238X|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is a hilarious writer, and she lives up to that description in this witty and hilarious book. Samantha is a high strung London lawyer who is expected to make partner at her fancy law firm. An unprecedented mistake sends her running for the hills, literally and into an unexpected career change...that of a housekeeper in the country. There she learns how to cook and clean and well enjoy life...Something she had not done since she was a kid.<br /><br />Kinsella is not trying to create a masterpiece here, just some fun light reading. So if you're in the need of something to take your mind off things and just escape into some funny and delightful characters pick this one up.
B007H520DG|4.0|The Good Wife is intelligent, well written, (except for the occasional liberal comments) and so very sophisticated and entertaining. It is the best series I have ever gotten interested in. The move to Sunday night following The Great Race seems to be a bid to kill it. With football, and then basketball, it is delayed, so that DVR gets half The Great Race (arguably the worst series on TV) and half the Good Wife, which is why I ended up paying for episodes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked this book, more so than the first. However,  I found that there were  2 many<br />descriptive sex scenes ..... It almost got in the way of the story. None the less,<br />I was so proud at how far Mr.Grey has come along with facing his demons...I adore<br />The relationship development between Ana and Christen. I'm exited 2 read the<br />Last book in the trilogy.  :)

B004LWZW7E|5.0|I must be one of the few people that really enjoyed this movie. Time is currency and it's hoarded by wealthy people who control everything. Another thing I noticed is that Timberlake is developing into a decent actor.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I recently went to see the Hunger Games movie. I cannot compare it with the book however since my Kindle that was little more then a year old stopped working as I was right in the middle of it! Not happy with a product that had such a short life. I am glad I didn't have alot of prepurchased books on it yet to read.

B003Y5H556|4.0|What I disliked and what I wish was different:<br />First 4 minutes.. Basically nothing was told and then.. 10 years later. Wonderful. Don't you think that was a little too fast to move from past to present?<br />Who put a wax into that guy's hair?<br />Too many black people serving as guards among white men at that time is just wrong.<br />With guards there was a storyteller. Did he forget ink somewhere? And he could pretend like he was writing a little better.<br />Even with this unnecessary love story it's still better than ''Twilight''.<br />Instead of the Riding Red Hood actress, they could use someone less known. I just simply dislike their choice, I dislike her. She isn't the right actress for that role.<br />Same goes for the guy with wax in the hair.<br />It's all right that story of the Red Riding Hood was twisted, and there was this father Solomon, but love out of the way. It was unnecessary. The movie could be so much better if something else took it's place. Show me an exciting story, not this: ''I love you, I love you not'' melodrama. I welcome any other remake or another twist on Red Riding Hood. Why? Because they could be just as bad or actually a good movie would be created.<br />''Don't you want me''? Ah, seriously? GTFO! Nowadays a good horror movie must include a sex scene or two. This movie is so cool, I've seen an almost a sex scene. Eh, no. Nothing new to see here. Waste of precious time that could be used on something else.<br />Hey there is this big bad wolf in front of you, woman. Show me some real fear. Forget that it's animated and put your fake strong will to somewhere else. Of course then it was predictable. Guards were near and then like in other movies the beast had to run away and the ''princess'' was saved. Eh, nothing new in here.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />Atmosphere the movie gave away: was close to pleasant. I liked the set, falling snow and forest gave it a lot of beauty. The visual effects are beautiful.<br />Overall the movie was still good despite many things which I didn't like. I think I will watch it again. It's not as bad as it turned out to be.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is just like Mario. so if you like that you will live this. works great on kindle fire
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Story was so engaging, couldn't put the book down.  Loved the constant twists and turns.  Not predictable.  Movie does not do this book justice.
1843793792|5.0|wow i never ever bought audio book cd  my life, cause im Richard Armitage huge fan!! wow wow wow its great story and i can study english as well  close eyes you can imagination .. thank you very much<br /> who made this audio book also Thank you Richard Armitage you are most very talented  actor!! thank you arigatou!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I admit, I only made it through the sample.  Any more than that and I would have been unable to keep my lunch down.<br />Poorly conceived and just as poorly written.  Can't imagine the sex scenes and I really don't want to.  I really cannot imagine a more inane voice for a genre which should burn so brightly, one's Kindle should waft smoke.  Glad I did not cough up ten bucks for this ... crap.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is a comedy-drama film with an all-star British cast.<br /><br />The story follows seven retirees who are drawn to an Indian hotel that accommodates the elderly, and most of the group is single. They all have their own reasons as to why they are departing Britain, and as the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that they are seeking new beginnings and resolution from the past.<br /><br />The characters have well defined personalities which are strongly conveyed by acclaimed actors. The cast includes: Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, and Dev Patel.<br /><br />The movie allows the viewer to appreciate that the challenges of life can push people out of their comfort zones, yet it is still possible to find a place that is peaceful and enlightening by daring to search for it.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B002VX0A40|5.0|Love all the different textures on this product! I hung it on the play mat and my baby loves to grab and shake it. Received just what I ordered.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I really like it but it's hard to control and its fun and all but its very confusing so if you are a girl and you act all girlish and like pink like me don't get this app
B005Q1W10A|2.0|I was very excited to watch Season 2 of Downton Abbey after such a great Season 1.  Unfortunately, the great writing of the first season was not carried on.  By episode 3 of season 2, Downton Abbey completely falls apart as a series.  The plot lines and character behavior become improbable, erratic, nonsensical and incredible.  It's a shame because the show had such great potential.
B005VW4Q70|4.0|This is a beautiful CD.  The music sounds like from Spain.  Makes you want to flamenco dance.  The guitar playing is the best I have heard.  There are no lyrics in the CD but that is what I wanted. Great CD!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|This book truly is amazing. I really enjoyed reading it. I had to do it for a class, but there came a point when I couldn't put it down. I carried it around with me on my phone and every time I had a spare minute I would read it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game so much. It reminds me of the original super Mario game. Can't wait for an update for it.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but just felt like watching it again last night before Easter.  It is truly a brilliant movie, difficult to watch at times perhaps, but artistically and creatively brilliant nonetheless.  Jim Caviezel is simply remarkable as an actor.  In much of the movie, all of his emotion, back story, intentions were revealed through his eyes, in fact one eye.  And it all came across with intense clarity.  To me, He is remarkable also as a Christian, allowing himself to endure intense physical agony for a piece of film about His Savior.  It was a true labor of love.  I thought he was perfect for the role, portraying a manly, kind, strong, humble, and gracious Jesus rather than a one dimensional characterization of this blandly perfect person.  This time as I watched the long journey of Jesus carrying the cross, I was struck by a few critically beautiful moments that I think Mel Gibson and/or Jim Caviezel captured perfectly:<br /><br />Through the agony and torture of what He was experiencing as He walked, evil literally surrounding Him, this quiet moment of Mary coming to Him, showing Him that she would be there for Him, it seemed to almost physically strengthen Him, bless Him.  He was on a mission and He knew what He was doing as God and yet He was still human enough to receive encouragement from his mother.  He says to her \\"I make all things new!\\" which in turn serves to strengthen her with her own suffering.  The same beautiful moment with Veronica who came to wipe his face and give him a glass of water.  Such intensely beautiful moments because we can see a tiny bit of goodness amidst the human capacity to hate and destroy.  After so many of His friends deserted Him, the growing connection between Simon, who helped carry His cross, and Jesus was also extremely touching.  Then there was the scene on the cross when the thief professed faith in Him, Jesus looked almost relieved, like in that moment, despite the pain He was enduring, He remembered why He was doing this and who it was for.  The love in his (Caviezle's) eyes was almost palpable.<br /><br />I am very familiar with this story and I am very moved by the extent that Jesus went to stand between me and God's wrath toward sin, especially MY sin.  Several times during the trial and torture and beating scenes, I would whisper \\"I really don't know how you did that.\\"  I wanted to defend, to fight back, to shout, \\"You don't understand!!\\" but He withheld for the purpose of displaying true Love and providing a way for those very people to be forgiven and given new life.<br /><br />The movie is definitely an emotional experience, not one I would lightly choose to undergo.  I respect Mel Gibson's decision to focus only on the \\"passion\\" of the Christ, but I really wished we could have seen more about the resurrection and the excitement and joy of seeing Him alive again and the implications of that for us.  It is this miracle of new life and a new beginning, that is freely offered to us.  Jesus literally did/does make all things new!  The movie challenges me, reminds me, encourages me, as I move forward in my own life, fulfilling the purposes God has for me.  I am so glad they made this film.

B003B5M0PO|4.0|While on a long inter-continental flight, with nothing better to do, I watched the movie, \\"War Horse\\" produced by Steven Spielberg. I was spell-bound. I then decided to buy the book and read it. To my surprise, it was written with the POV being that of the horse. The \\"I\\" in the book is the horse Joey.<br /><br />I cannot help but compare the book to the movie, and this is one of the few occasions when I must say on the whole, the movie is better than the book except for one scene.<br /><br />The story is that of a horse, Joey, and its strength and courage in surviving that horrific war in which it was drafted into serving, first on the British side, then on the German side, all the while thinking of \\"home\\" with its original owner, the young man Albert. The various descriptions of the battles and that scene of the German soldier working with a British soldier in freeing Joey from the barb wires, all showed the stupidity and futility of the war.<br /><br />The way the movie handled the situation where, Albert and Joey towards the end managed to get together was very touching and more convincing than the way the situation was handled in the book.<br /><br />The one scene where the book excelled is the scene where Joey met the tank. In the movie, it didn't quite capture the fear in Joey, the fear that led to his running away madly into no-man's land. But the book described that feeling in Joey extremely well.<br /><br />I have not seen the West-End play, but now I would like to see it.<br /><br />In summary, I like this book and would recommend that anyone who has seen the movie, should get this book and read it. It gives a slightly different feel and enjoyment of the \\"War Horse\\" experience.
B006L4MX0Y|5.0|I rented this, believing I would regret it, shaking my head. Usually, foreign movies are hit or miss, especially older, Japanese films. 20 minutes in, I wanted to give this film multiple Oscars. As far as I know, the Academy didn't recognize this film at all, which is an outrage. It is a great movie with a great social message, despite the gore. This could never be remade in America. I imagine the title would turn many Americans off, who wouldn't take this seriously. This was the best $4 I've spent on a movie in a decade. I would have to say that this movie has made my top 10 list. It's a travesty that around 2000, Americans were taking in Crouching Tiger when this was a far superior film. Did I mention that it's a very intelligently written film too?<br /><br />Needless to say, I was shaken, and I will be buying this film as soon as possible. Don't hesitate, rent this movie, especially if the Hunger Games movie disappointed you. This is everything that movie should have been.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|There is nothing else to get...nothing else to HEAR!  This is all you need.  Wonderful!!  Nothing else to say!  All my favorite artists are showcased here, sounding off with their best assets, the things we love them best for.  What!!!  Ledisi, Lalah, Musiq...oh my!!!!  Meshelle!!  King!!<br /><br />My favorite songs are Cherish the day, GONNA BE ALRIGHT, MOVE LOVE, Ah yeah, THE CONSEQUENCES OF JEALOUSY... and I'm still listening.  Afro is good too, but not on the same level as, really, everything from Cherish the day and down.  It's like you're listening to it and you can't even MOVE!!!<br /><br />Love, love, love this WORK OF ART AND SOUL!!!!  Sorry to be corny, but it's the truth!

B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled is an absolute adorable tale of repunzel & her adventure with Flynn Ryder.  Won't go into the million different reasons why my family and I love this movie. I will say however, I still looking forward to seeing it every time my 2 year old wants to watch it for even the 3rd time that day! It's a family favorite with adorable characters & excellent memorable songs. My daughter sings them all day long and they never get old. Any age is guaranteed to love this new Disney classic.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I would love to see this in musical form!!! The soundtrack for this film has got to be one of my favorites. Glen and Marketa's musical talents totally shine on the soundtrack, and it's so unlike anything else you've ever heard accompany a movie. The two both said they were pleased with how the movie was adapted into a musical in this interview: [...] I feel like watching this play is guaranteed to bring on the waterworks!
B0000029AP|4.0|TOYS!,TOYS!,TOYS!Just a young teen when I rocked to \\"SWEET EMOTION\\" and \\"WALK THIS WAY\\". Rock anthems they are!More great tunes are,\\"YOU SEE ME CRYING\\" which got some airplay.This album boosted AEROSMITH into the commercially business aspect of rock. \\"UNCLE SALTY\\" That's funny,HUH? Good tune from early \\"AEROSMITH\\". \\"ADAMS APPLE\\", sounds like the story of evolution and creation put to rock.LOL GREAT TUNE!NO MORE,NO MORE and ROUND AND ROUND, good solid \\"AEROSMITH\\" This album compliments \\"GET YOUR WINGS\\".....essentials.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|This is a new find for me... I've been finding a lot of gems lately! I just resonate with joy when I hear the music The Temper Trap has created! I love the vocalist and how his voice ties the elements of the band and the songs together. His ability to sing songs that are very jubilant and then switch to the passionate \\"Soldier On\\" is nothing short of amazing. I noticed that some people bought the album purely for \\"Sweet Disposition\\" then were indifferent about the rest of the songs. Honestly I feel that there is something for everyone on this album. Give it a listen!
B005LBJ2GQ|2.0|I have been an Opeth fan for years.  I've always embraced the more melodic, slower material as much as I did the heavier, death metal-like songs.  Like most Opeth fans, I have seen the band transition over the years from a death metal band, to progressive metal, now to this.  If you are looking for an Opeth album similar to those of old, you will not find it here.  There is not a single heavy song on this album.  In fact, it sounds more like an Indie coffee shop alt rock album.  Don't get me wrong, the guitars and melodic sections are still beautifully written and executed in an okay manner, but the whole album just reeks too much of self reflection.  Gone are the heavy guitars, double bass, and epic pieces that leave you exhausted after listening.  So this is the new Opeth, much more like Enya these days than Emperor.  Too bad.  At least I always have their older stuff to turn to.
B0013FBS20|1.0|Too boring. Empty movie, mindless...<br /><br />I was waiting for the story to build up, but minutes were passing by and nothing. I had to keep skipping forward to see if something interesting would come up, but to no avail. I don't know why Will Smith subjected himself to play this role, it was a bad move and movie for his career.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Great all time movie. Touching, excellentely interpreted by Robin Williams and all the other actors. A lesson to learn with regards to sick, hospitalized people that, being sick, need attention and care of all kind.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Best app ever I never had anything like it and there is no doubt in my mind BEST ROVIO GAME EVER!!!!!!
B0073PPNE8|4.0|I watched this movie years ago and thought it was very good. I have never bought it in DVD but recently decided to add this movie to my Blu-ray collection. Its picture and sound are excellent in High Definition. Highly recommended!
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I ordered this series to share in my Introduction to Psychology class. It offered a view into what happens behind the door in a treatment setting. The students were riveted to the story line  for each client.  I was able to take concepts and allow them to see them in front of them.  The cast was spot on in their characterization of their psychotherapy sessions. I would highly recommend the series to anyone. In treatment is fantastic!
B0064MT1U8|5.0|Some people may argue about the Best Picture Oscar for this movie (and I'm one of those) but I will agree that it's a good movie with terrific acting and costume. It has never looked better in Blu-ray. The fine details and colors of the costumes are just outstanding in High Definition. The sound will not rock your house because it doesn't have a lot of low frequency effect (LFE) but the score and dialogue are both great thanks to a lossless sound track. Highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just bought the book this evening and a few hours later, I am done reading it.  I don't know how Nicholas Sparks does it, but every book he has written, speaks to me in some way.  I have read almost every book he has written.<br /><br />I agree that this is not a typical \\"love story\\" by Sparks, however he's done it again!  This was a very well written story.  Yes, I was pretty sure I knew the ending, however I was never bored with the book.  The story keeps you involved and somehow makes you want more.<br /><br />If you have a past that isn't the greatest, this book is for you.  It will make you remember the bad times, but also remind you that you can overcome the bad memories.  It helps you reflect where you were and where you are now.  It reminds you not to make those same mistakes again.<br /><br />If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, this book will not disappoint you.  Hope you enjoy the book, just as much as I did.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Even if you don't THINK you'd enjoy \\"opera\\" as I've said a number of times - I REALLY found this moving and entertaining.<br /><br />I love most of the classic theatre arts except opera.  \\"Phantom\\" is something different.  I never saw the live stage production or the movie.  I did find a few of the musical parts (by Andrew Lloyd Weber) sort of \\"infectious\\" with their sound and composition.<br /><br />I sat down one Saturday evening recently trying to find something enjoyable, for a change, to watch on television when I came across a broadcast on PBS of this 25th Anniversary production.  I started watching and found I was getting aggravated at the scheduled \\"breaks\\" in the programming.  I knew my wife and daughter had enjoyed some of the soundtrack and my daughter had seen the movie.  After finishing the broadcast, I decided that this Blu-Ray would make great gifts for them.  That way I could enjoy seeing it again with them!!<br /><br />This edition has a \\"special ending\\" with part of the original cast.  If you are a \\"Phan\\", this is one DVD you must add to your collection - worth every bit of the money spent.
0800141660|1.0|I found the movie entertaining despite some butchering of AUSTEN's great work by Thompson's screenplay (they couldnt do justice to Austen in less than 2 hours like the 1995 P&P did so well in 5 and a half hours obviously)...and Thompson's acting along with many in the cast was very good (good job Rickman). But thats where my praise ends.  My problem is my bias towards Emma Thompson, I have a hard time trusting anything done by this woman. Thompson is a Godless, illogical, JEW-hating, under-educated, hypocritical, Nut Case who thinks using spray under-arm deodorant every morning is warming the globe (which may be part of the reason BRANAUGH dumped her..lol). She bought land trying to block increasing runway space at england's largest airport. But then turns around to fly first class from the same airport (VIP express on boarding) to hollywood to get some silly award for play-acting. She supports the same Palestinian Terrorists that would love to blow her out of the sky in her comfy first class seat, and thinks those Jews getting killed by rockets and living in fear of these same people in Isreal deserve it. She adopts some African kid, to prove she's not racist, and demands England destroy itself by becoming a more \\"diverse\\" nation by flooding it with people from third world countries, instead of helping those same countries advance on their own. JANE AUSTEN once said she (parapharashed) \\"wrote stories about the small world's of peoples lives\\". I think THOMPSON is living in a very small \\"self-hating\\" world and is trying to spread her hate. So forgive me JANE AUSTEN LOVERS (which I am One), im giving this version of SENSE and SENSIBILITY a ONE STAR in PROTEST.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|The Naked Sun is a very clever interstellar detective story featuring NYPD's finest detective, Elijah Bailey.<br />If you enjoy plots that keep you on your toes, you'll love The Naked Sun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I agree with everything already pointed out in previous reviews that the author spends nearly ALL her time telling rather than showing, summarizing rather than actually moving forward with a plot--and then recycles what is, in essence, the same plot.

0345803485|1.0|Gutless story offers a little titillation (possibly) to people who don't have much of a sex life.  It's also a cop-out and it misses what at least could have been an ironic ending.  A young woman gets to experience some mild bdsm, and I mean mild, with lots and lots of silly lists, and then, at the end, after a number of bdsm induced orgasms, she frees herself from the shackles of her sexual thralldom and heaps scorn upon the man who would do such things to her. So, she's had her walk on the wild side (although it's not very wild) and has devastated her supposed master with her withering contempt at the end, and, of course, she accepts no responsibility. Yawn. If you're looking for something that has some substance try THE STORY OF O, or THE IMAGE.  They're for adults.  I don't know who this badly written crap could be for and I am absolutely mystified that it has sold so well.  It gives a bad name to best sellers.

0062119044|5.0|Gripping and beautifully paced. Shriver's lyrical use of language intensifies the development of his characters. The conclusion, while a shock, rings true.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I'm still reading this book, and don't want it to end.  It was recommended by a friend, and it's not something I would have normally picked up, but I was hooked right from the start.  I don't usually like anything bloody, scary, gory, dangerous,etc., and there isn't too much of that type of thing in this book, but the little bits that are, just make it super realistic and keep you on the edge of your seat.  Very well written too!
B007BVOF8E|1.0|This sucked. Dont waste your money or time. The only reason I finished watching it is cause im sick and had nothing else to do.<br />The script and storyline bounce around so much and sometimes doesn't make sense. There were a lot o unnecessary scenes. It was boring as hell. No drama, no having to think about it, or stunners. It sucked and I want my money back.

B007R4ZNWW|5.0|A fascinating and powerful departure for Almodovar, or perhaps more<br />accurately more an terrific hybrid of the best of his old and new.<br />This has the darker, more actively perversely disturbing and violent themes<br />of some of his early work like 'Matador' but shot and directed with the<br />far smoother and more mature hand he has developed over the years. It<br />also uses the more complex and fractured time structure style of<br />Almodovar's more recent work, to great effect.<br /><br />In the end it's a gorgeous looking, philosophically complex mystery and<br />horror film. Although not gory, this is a disturbing work, both on a<br />literal story level, and also for the questions it raises about sexual and personal<br />identity, love, sado-masochism, and passion run amok.<br /><br />These themes are all Almodovar touchstones, but delivered here with a<br />visually stunning icy touch, and with much more complete logic than in<br />his early works, which often felt less fully thought through, and had<br />more frustrating plot holes and character leaps.<br /><br />Not a 'scary' film, but a creepy, moody and highly effective one. A<br />dark fairy tale as told by, say Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />It's good to see Antonio Banderas reunited with Almodovar, and he<br />delivers a wonderfully complex and quirky modern day Dr. Frankenstein.<br /><br />Less emotional than my two very favorite Almodovar films (Talk to Her,<br />All About My Mother), but its exciting to see this extremely talented<br />film maker continue to evolve and grow, and I think this represents<br />work that can stand among his best.

B0077ATSU4|5.0|I must admit when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it was going to be a sappy love story.  Boy I was wrong this movie is an awsome movie and the actors and actress playing the indivual parts do an awsome job.  I must admit in one sceen in the movie when Sandra Bullock and the actor playing her son are arguing in the Bedroom is brings back memories of arguring with my parents and realizing that parents and children never truly get along until after the children grow up and realize what they had.  The movie for me is something i think that everybody needs to see, not only for the events surrounding this movie but how familes can be broken but together at the sametime.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed this game but it was too short. Hopefully your next game will be longer. The clues are fun and interesting.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a little girl and got from it that \\"all girls are princesses\\". Now that I'm older, I still get that message from the movie along with other things as well. This is one of my favorite movies and I never get tired of watching it.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really love this game. I would reccommend it. My 9yr old son was watching me play and now we are playing it together. He loves it when we figure out a clue!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|So far I like this movie better than the first. In this movie, Rodrick and Greg start to get alone with each other and overcome obstacles that can cause siblings not to get alone with one another. I laughed a lot while watching this silly movie. Another one is due out soon and I can't wait to see it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Let me begin by stating this is not my usual type of \\"a good read\\".  But the synopsis caught my attention, I downloaded a sample, and I was hooked.  I literally could not put this book down.  I finished it in two days and felt a loss when I was done, similar to what I think Cheryl felt upon finishing the trail!  Anyone who has ever been through a loss in life or wondered when things were going to change and life would be good again needs to read this inspiring story. Don't get me wrong, this is not a \\"therapy\\" book, it is far more than that.  It is an exciting adventure, it is a love story, it is an awakening, it is a book about nature - human and other. I am now into my fourth novel since finishing \\"Wild\\" and it is hard to find a story that captures my interest as this book did. Even if this not your \\"type of book\\", give it a chance, download the sample and I bet you will be staying up tonight reading it too!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awsome game this game is a lot like mario im a fan of mario so this game is cool to me!!!!!!!!!aha sike!!!!

B0054W4JQK|2.0|This book came with a wide range of good reviews and I kept asking myself if I was missing something as I found most of the book was tedious and I nearly gave up reading it.<br /><br />This is a personal psychological Groundhog Day story about a woman, Christine, who has a serious brain injury where her memories disappear every time she falls asleep. She has has woken up for over 15 years up not knowing who or where she is. Her husband has to tell her each morning the basic facts about who she is and what has happened.<br /><br />Unknown to her husband, a psychiatrist takes a personal interest in her case and encourages her to write a daily journal so that she can keep track of her memories and experiences each day. As the journal develops she tries to make sense of conflicting evidence and discovers the web of lies surrounding her background and memories.<br /><br />I was frustrated in the early chapters that Christine was not able to piece together things quicker and start to take some action. I was even more frustrated that the psychiatrist was not able to see what was happening and help her more. The book only came to life in the last few chapters when reality started to cut in. The finale was not that exciting or satisfying.<br /><br />S J Watson is a capable writer but probably chose a too challenging and complex psychological plot for his first novel.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recomend it for anyone that reads and studies the Word of God. Thank you for a very good app.
0345803485|1.0|I want my money back!  Horrible.  Rubbish.  The most poorly written book I've read in recent memory. Makes any harlequin romance look like prize-winning literature.  Is this book some kind of joke!?  Was there even anyone editing this garbage?  Do us all a favor and please give the author a thesaurus.  How many times can one character \\"blush\\", \\"look down at my hands\\", \\"bite her lip\\"?  PS.  Americans don't carry \\"satchels\\" or eat \\"syllabub\\".  Duh!
0545265355|5.0|Can't say more , cheap !! It was a birthday gift for some one and they love it , was here on time .,. :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Works awesome.  Need to not make it so hard to get and keep energy. Update!  There is no reason you should loose energy from collecting coil. That's my opinion.  Love the game.
B007LB1O3I|1.0|Hack pure hack! Total retread! I can just see her now in the studio saying \\" I'm all out of ideas I'm in my 50's so make me sound like all the other crap that is out there\\" Well you accomplished it!
6302797535|5.0|This is one of the funnies movies I've ever seen. I just had to have it. The box and movie were seperate to perserve the cover. Great condition. Thanks.

B007DIQB50|5.0|Perfect mixture of Old Nicki with New Nicki.  I Love all the dance tracks and all of the funny raps that Nicki is so good at.  I rarely buy cds...very very rarely, however I'm very pleased I purchased this one.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Intense, cruel, realistic. Rebuild the nascent Atlantic City and its key characters. The back and new details emerge aver in history. Highly Recommended. This second part will be more richer in content. I hope so.
159562015X|5.0|Quick read, This book did not provide any earth shaking revelations about my strenghts: however, it did provide some thought provoking<br />new ways to address weaknesses
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Kindle fire user here. for some reason it won't upload from my gallery anymore.  what's the deal? 5 bucks is a lot for a crappy app.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I don't play a lot of games but do enjoy an occasional downtime game and this fits the bill perfectly.  It's quick and not too complicated.  No ads and it was free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its awesome! I like it cause its just like Mario! it also has really good graphics! if I have children, they will have to play this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book before the movie came out. Glad I did. The movie did not do it justice! I could not put this book down. I read it in class, at work, at home for hours at a time. It's not a girly book like Twilight so my boyfriend actually decided to watch the movie with me! This book really makes you think about human nature, government, politics, etc.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's the same old Spider solitaire. This will keep you entertained for a while. I haven't had problem with pop up ads except when you're starting a new game. Can't complain; it's a free game!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy and thought each one was better than the last.  I was disappointed when it was over. The story was a love story and not about porn as many people think.  Cant wait for the film version.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|GET THIS APP FOREAL ! If you have beat all other angry bird games then play this!!! You'll delete the others. (p.s) the golden egg levels are way better<br />,
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the variety of games but the bad part was how you had to have a lot of points to get a new game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a pretty cool game it seasy to play and everything......... dont listen wen people say it takes forever to get energy...... it takes maybe half an hour at the most
B007PTJOV0|5.0|yep. very mario brothers like. easy controls. fun to play. i can see my wife and daughter enjoying this one too. nice app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game play it all the time although I think they should make it a little easier to unlock the harder levels
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like Super Mario Brothers..... Maybe better. Great free app! Great app period. I'm not much of a gamer on the Kindle, but this is great!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wow fancy game great graphics interesting game play i really d o l i k e t h i s g a m e
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a great game and its has many different things to. do. I didn't have a problem with the update like everyone was saying though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed this story very much. It had really good characters I could believe in. I liked it because there wasn't a lot of super science in the story just a believable future. I have a soft spot for stories were the people involved have lost touch with the past, and they are in the process of discovering it anew. I have paid a lot more money for books that are not nearly as well written as these. The one criticism I have is one I see a lot of authors do and that is make (in my opinion) the main characters too introspective. I find it slows down the story. If I want philosophy I will buy a book of philosophy and read it. Maybe younger readers like deep thinking heros. I like the author deep thinking, but not the characters.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's not very often that I read a sequel better than the the first book. Suzanne Collins has blown me away with the best book I have ever read, and will probably ever read. I can't wait to start \\"Mockingjay\\"!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|totally fantastic!!!!! when you find Jesus Christ you have life!! how i pray for more people to watch movies like this one and fireproof,,God Bless
0061703087|5.0|This is one of Crichton's better books. First person narrator (which is not my favorite), but superlative pacing, and definitely an example of one of those stories that you feel as though you HAVE to keep reading.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. it is very easy to pick it up and start playing. you don't really need acutal money you just earn it in the game. the best part; ITS FREE!!!!
B003XT60KO|5.0|Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.<br />Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn't<br />imagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have found this app to be very easy to use and navigate.  I have held my place in my daily reading and made notes on the passages I have read.  I especially love that I can pick up where I left off with my smartphone if I do not have my Kindle Fire close by.  You can also choose from many translations so you can read your favorite.  I highly recommend this app!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Interesting things in this work of fiction. Mostly Genocide, hate and egregious violations of human rights. Its amazing how such an &quot;important&quot; book can be so poorly written. terrible.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|works great for Kindle Fire. Lots to do and I couldn't seem to put it down. I recommend this game for any kindle User. also it's free
B00509CRG6|3.0|I'll admit, I enjoyed the book, but good grief it sounded like he spent about 20 minutes a night writing it just before going to sleep.  It's baseless and pathos-driven writing directed at people looking for something new.  Oh noes! Recession!  Quick, write a book about rethinking business!<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Conformity isn't your best asset as an employee.  But really, did you need this book to know that?  Maybe you did.  Then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book, as it is written, offers little more than trendy airplane reading.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read this book 3 times in less than a month. I loved it the first time and was sad when it ended, then decided to read it again to refresh my memory and read it again a week later. Obsessed. It's totally dysfunctional but I can't help but root for them every time anyways!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun and addicting.  if you like easy &amp; fun level games this one is for you.  great graphics,  no so annoying music and easy game controls.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|As a foreigner, this is what I understand as American Rock and Roll! Sound quality is perfect. Has both high energy and ballad songs. Very good live record, highly recommend!!!
B00782O7NE|5.0|In an era where we rely heavily on CGI and 3D to wow us, this movie takes us back to a time when acting was truly an art, men were gentlemen, women were proper, and moviegoing was a theatrical and magical experience. Gone are the days when we can get into our Sunday best and spend an evening at the theater for a movie and a live show. Nowadays, anyone can catch a flick at 10am 7 days a week wearing their jammies, and often being the sole soul in the theater.<br /><br />Spoiler: this is a silent movie. Sorry if I've lost your attention already. But hear me out. True, this is one of your \\"been there, done that - married boy meets single girl, married boy falls in love with single girl, married boy can't have single girl, single girl moves on, and there is still a happy ending\\" story. But it's not the story that makes this movie - it's the way the story is told that makes this movie revolutionary and epic. Jean's and Bérénice's pure, raw emotion, in addition to a stellar soundtrack, tell the entire story without the need for schnazzy graphics or complex plot. Dialogue is only displayed on screen maybe less that twenty times. The rest of the story is told entirely through kinesics, which is relayed via stellar acting.<br /><br />I don't usually go see a movie in the theaters twice. I will see it once, and if it's good enough to see again will wait until it comes out on Blu Ray. But this movie...I even convinced by buddy, who had zero interest in seeing the movie and hadn't even heard of it, to go see it, and he loved it.<br /><br />The score is also worth picking up. Yes, it's 100% instrumental. But 50% of the meaning of the movie is through this score! Even if you've not seen the movie, it's written so well that you can feel the emotion just by sitting back and closing your eyes while listening to it.<br /><br />I can only hope that we begin to see more silent movies like this.
B006C45CFG|5.0|Don't try to make sense of this movie or pick it apart. Just enjoy it for what it is- a really entertaining well done movie! It's a good old fashioned western meets a good sci-fi movie. It's one of the most unique movies I have seen in a long time. Cool looking aliens, good acting, mystery and lots of action. It's a fun way to spend two hours!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Fun app! Just like the other story games. I'm on restaurant, bakery, and pet shop story. Feel free to add me. storm id: zeesmom

B006PTZNSY|4.0|Wanna know why Nicki named her sophomore album Roman Reloaded? Well the majority of it is obvious, her infamous alter-ego Roman Zolanski has re-fueled and is ready to come back even stronger than \\"he\\" appeared. The first track of this album entitled \\"Roman Holiday\\" kind of explains why Roman took a vacation. It's as good as an explanation that Roman and Martha, Nicki's second alter-ego can give. As you progress through the first six tracks of Roman Reloaded, after a while you realize the musical content is merely a facade, and Roman is essentially just screaming into a microphone with \\"his\\" trademark attitude and flare. Some tracks do offer alot of promise (\\"Roman Holiday\\" and \\"I am your leader\\"), while some are just downright hilarious, and embarrassing (\\"Come on a cone\\" and \\"HOV Lane\\"). After airing the dirty laundry, Roman calms down for tracks 7-9, all of which are highlights (especially \\"Sex in the lounge\\", for obvious reasons). And Roman essentially exits after track 9, because as soon as you hit \\"Starships\\", the whole direction of the album switches completely. Now we dive into the brighter, pop, side of Nicki Minaj. The second half is where she manages to balance attititude with fun. Tracks 10-18 are all stand-outs and very good assests to this album. After the musical ear-garbage of the first half, Nicki offers songs you just can't skip. Now there's one thing left to cover, the greatly-panned and commerically hated closing track, \\"Stupid Hoe\\". Immediately upon its release, the overhwhelmingly negative response came from her fans, most of which said she was a stupid hoe for creating that song. It seems that this vicious attack on her rival is underappreciated. Believe it or not, \\"Stupid Hoe\\" is one of the most catchy and musically sound tracks on Roman Reloaded, and it offers a good story book ending. Roman Reloaded ended just like it began, with the harsh persona of this character. Long story short, if you cut the fat from this album, you are left with thevery lean and mean beats that only Nicki/Roman/Martha can deliver.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Ceremonials is a great follow to Florence and the Machine's last album Lungs. It is a great album and I love it because it is so eay to listen to it.
B00008QSA5|3.0|I own the 90s version of this that sounded terrible. Anyone who thinks that the one that came out in 1990 sounds better needs to do an A/B. The original tracks sound great and rich, great stereo imaging an not harsh on the high end(a personal pet peeve of mine). I gotta say I agree with Al in that I think the horns sound great and do not detract but rather add to the tunes. Sure his Holy Modal Majesty is a bit tedious and ends with Bloomfield detuning his guitar and not getting it properly in tune before he plays the last chords. Bloomfield plays a lot of fast passages that seem to go nowhere but he played like that on East-West. He's better when he's not doing that like on Albert's shuffle. Anyway the bonus cuts are very hit and miss which is why 2 stars were taken away. The remix version of Albert's shuffle is dreadful. The panning placement of Bloomfield's guitar gets moved and seems to have a harsher quality to it. Why Al didn't just release the regular track and not pot up the horns is a question I am trying to find out. The tune Blues for Nothing sounds great albeit kind of a rehash of Really if it is at all a different tune. The last tune Fat Grey Cloud is insulting. The mix is dreadful and the recording has inherent distortion. And you're gonna end the CD with that? There goes a star in the rating. The bar of sonic quality was set very high at the beginning of the Cd and then goes in the sewer for the last cut. Doesn't make sense. Bloomfield's guitar for many of the blues tunes is panned to the hard left and sits nicely in the sonic spectrum there. Then the last tune he's panned hard right with the bass too loud in the mix. Why put it on at all? If a bonus cut is not in the same league sonically as the original, don't put it out and for god's sake let that not be the last impression/tune we get when listening to the CD.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Lungs is a wonderful album and the songs are great. I had never heard of Florence and the Machine, but now I look forward to each album they release.Please some more of this wonderful music.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I don't even know where to start with all the reasons I love this book. The drama! Oh sweet baby Jesus, how I adore the drama. The aching, the need, the desperation, the heartbreak, the laughter, the tears...there is just too much to get into in just one review. My mind is still trying to take it all in. As I mentioned, Will is amazing. Lake is a beautiful, wonderful leading female character. I only had the urge to punch her like...once...maybe. Which is saying a lot because I have some issues with wanting to punch people. It's an addiction or a bad habit, you might say. I loved Kel and Caulder, again, this just shows how amazing of a writer Colleen Hoover is because I have a general distaste for anyone under the age of fifteen. Julia is probably my favorite book mom of all time. Eddie is awesome, Gavin is adorable...<br /><br />You know, anything else I say will just be gushing. More gushing. Lots of gushing. Just go read the book. If you love YA romance, a good bit of a drama and the most awesome leading man ever, I am pretty sure you will love this book!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a King fan for well over 20 years...I love mst of his books although he has had his ups and downs (although a weak King is usually still a few notches above good novels by other fiction auhors).  When I heard first abouth 11/22/63 I had high hopes -- and King vastly exceeded my expectations. This is his best book yet in my view:  a very smart plot, well developed characters, a very likeable hero,  a total lack of predictability, and a great ending -- and all of that set against the backdrop of 1960s America, a place and time that has alway fascinated me.  This is the kind of book whose magic will stay with the reader long after finishing it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|works well and the ads are unobtrusive. very nice app for idle moments. must have on the kindle fire. word.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like Mario love it my kids are gonna love this game a lot. aviator is very habit forming to play so beware. but love it.
B003VZL9N8|5.0|I have mixed feelings about BGO records. While they're responsible for reissuing a great deal of music, they can also be known for re releasing albums and calling them remastered leading people to believe that they're new remasters when clearly they are the versions that have been previously released. I bought this disc expecting to hear and new and improved job and was disappointed when the cd started with Gary's opening guitar licks with the same surface noise pops still intact. Given the fact that professional engineers have now had access to pop removal software for 20 years and most home computers even come with some sort of pop removal in their audio software, I'm very doubtful that this was remastered two years ago. Upon further listening, there are a couple of very brief spots of tape wobble or distortion that were also there in the Capitol cd transfers from decades ago. After listening to the whole album, I'm certain that this is simply a fresh transfer of the old cd edition.<br /><br />Happy Trails, Quicksilver's second album, was mostly recorded live at the Fillmore East and West in 1968 as well as some studio recording done live at Golden State Recorders. It was released March 29, 1969 on Capitol Records and sold quite well hitting #27 on the Billboard charts. Guitarist Gary Duncan had already left the band by the time the album was released. The first half of the record is given to a cover of Bo Diddley's Who Do You Love with interconnected sections with different band members each getting a chance to shine. The second half of the album begins with another Bo Diddley song called Mona. Mona gives way to Maiden Of The Cancer Moon which, in turn, flows into Calvary which has a nice exotic flavor. The album ends with a short cover of Happy Trails. A must have album!<br /><br />edit to add: 4-24-12 I just received the the Repertoire version and it is better than the Capitol version that I've known since it's release and much better than this version. I didn't know about that version until after I had already posted this review!t know about that version until after I had already posted this review!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|When Colin Clark, the wealthy son of a nobleman, was twenty-three, he worked as a third assistant director for Sir Laurence Olivier on the set of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. The movie co-starred Olivier as the Prince and Marilyn Monroe as the Showgirl. Olivier hired Monroe as his co-star because he was intending the movie to be the film that would ignite his career with American audiences. Monroe was hoping the experience of working with the illustrious Olivier in an English production would help her land more serious roles and be the stepping stone to becoming a seriously regarded actress. However, neither the experience nor the film itself turned out the way either had hoped. During the filming of THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, Clark spent a week closely working with Monroe, becoming her escort and confidant.  MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is based off Clark's books (he wrote two different books about the experience).<br /><br />The film begins with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) determined to get a job at Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) film studio. He's eventually hired and goes to work as Olivier's third assistant director on the set of his newest production, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. Shortly after Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives in England with all her entourage, including drama coach Paula Strausberg (Zoe Wanamaker) and new husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). There's lots of photo ops with Monroe and Olivier as the press eats up the meeting of American film royalty and British theatre royalty. The honeymoon is extremely short-lived and problems begin almost the instant filming begins as Monroe never on time and doesn't seem to understand the simplest direction. Olivier becomes outraged and the production becomes prolonged. During this time, Clark becomes acquainted with Monroe and she ends up choosing Clark to be her \\"friend\\" during this difficult period for her.<br /><br />The acting in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is superb. Williams delivers a stellar performance and is uncanny in her portrayal of Monroe. Likewise, Branagh's performance as Olivier is dead-on, too. I had never heard of Colin Clark before, but Redmayne gives a solid performance, too. Dame Judi Dench gives a wonderful performance as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Emma Watson, in her first post-Harry Potter role, is a delight on the screen as Lucy, the pre-Marilyn love interest of Clark.<br /><br />I enjoyed MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, but I was somewhat disappointed by it, too. The movie features some fantastic acting and the story involves some fascinating, real-life characters. However, this movie isn't about Marilyn Monroe or Laurence Olivier. It's about Colin Clark. The film is told from his point of view. Therefore, though Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier are featured, they aren't really what the story is about. The story is about this fascinating time in Clark's life and his thoughts and experiences while working on THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL. This one experience provides a lifetime of memories for him, but it's still just a week in his life and at the end of the movie he's not much different than he was at the start; he has a movie production under his belt, but he's still the son of a nobleman.<br /><br />MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a movie worth watching if you enjoy great acting, are a fan of any of the actors involved in the production, or if you have an interest in any of the real-life people the movie is about. The pacing of the movie is a bit uneven and the focus of the story is Clark and not Monroe or Olivier. With that said, it's still rather interesting to see how this one particular person spent his week with Marilyn Monroe.nce and is uncanny in her portrayal of Monroe.

0899661351|2.0|Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it.  So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably  boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing.  Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it.
B004EPZ0BQ|4.0|Two New York twenty-somethings, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis), are burned out on romance and opt to carry on a no-strings affair to avoid the pain and bother of love.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is quite clever: If you don't have to make an effort to be attentive and considerate of a lover due to working toward a long-term commitment, then presumably you can have nothing but fun without any hassles. Initially this approach to their sexual relationship frees up the two protagonists (in some quite comic love scenes) to openly inform each other, in the middle of sex, what they do and don't want in bed. Since we are two generations beyond the sex revolution of the 1960's with nudity in movies for some time now casually accepted, be prepared for a lot of it in this film. Fortunately, we are spared full, frontal nudity, and both stars are in great shape, so it's not a complete ordeal sitting through endless shots of their comely backsides.<br /><br />This is the first movie I've seen Justin Timberlake in. I was extremely impressed with his comic chops when he hosted Saturday Night Live, and I figured he would be ideal as a romantic comedy lead. He did not disappoint my expectation. He is charmingly vulnerable, witty, and quite attractive in this film.<br /><br />I had not previously seen Mila Kunis in anything. She does an excellent job as a snarky, clever, ambitious New Yorker, and I enjoyed the way she believably revealed, over the course of the film, her character's soft, romantic underbelly.<br /><br />What delighted me the most about this film is its lack of raunchy slapstick. The humor comes primarily from the witty repartee between the protagonists, which is my favorite kind of comedy. The pacing is excellent, and there are some wonderful supporting actors, including Richard Jenkins as Dylan's father who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Jenna Elfman is Dylan's sister. Patricia Clarkson is Jamie's mother, and Woody Harrelson is a gay coworker of Dylan.<br /><br />Overall a fun, very entertaining romantic comedy.y coworker of Dylan.<br /><br />Overall a fun, very entertaining romantic comedy.

B007H7XJD4|3.0|I've seen lots of people compare this to 300, it's not even close to that, nor do I think it was meant to be.  That being said, I still found the movie to be interesting, action packed, and was intrigued by the Greek Mythology incorporated into and driving the storyline.  This is a fantasy story, and not a bad one, made all the better by Mickey Rourke's portrayal of King Hyperion.
B004LWZW42|3.0|Matthew Vaughn and a cast of pretty up-and-comers (plus the ever-reliable Kevin Bacon) give it their all in this reboot of the X-Men franchise and yet a bevy of finely-edited sequences and masterly executed CG-effects cannot save the film from feeling particularly devoid of intriguing characterization or catharsis. There are early inklings of promising emotional connection, particularly with regard to Magneto's backstory. A surprise reveal in a Nazi doctor's office provides a backdrop for some heart-string tugging. And yet the inclusion of the Holocaust as a plot device feels forced--somewhat cruel--as though the filmmakers were simply capitalizing on a notoriously dour event for their own gains, the gene-splicing backbone of the story notwithstanding. This forced sentiment continues through the first hour of the film in which a dream-team of mutants is discovered (or not discovered, in the case of one amusing and profane cameo that will be worth the price of admissions for long-term fans). The trouble is, these kids never really develop beyond their 'talents', and are given little do but sit around in a room blowing things up, breathing under water, etc. They are never fully developed as three-dimensional characters. In fact, none of the characters are very interesting, save Magneto (more on him in a moment). James McAvoy's Professor X is humorous and affable but occasionally obnoxious. Kevin Bacon is playing Kevin Bacon playing a super villain. January Jones is wasted as the diamond-sharp femme fatale. It-Girl of the moment Jennifer Lawrence shows little of the range that earned her an oscar nod in the depressing indie Winter's Bone. Ultimately, this is Michael Fassbender's movie, though he takes control of the film about 1/3 of the time. Nevertheless, his character arc provides the only interesting plot progression or emotional emphasis, though this is diffused by everyone pretty much knowing exactly how this movie is going to end, and what will become of Magnetoin the future installments. There is still something intriguing about watching Fassbender hunt down Nazis in Argentina or invade Kevin Bacon's lair late in the film. He exudes careful malice, indicating an interior spiritual struggle lacking in the rest of the characters, despite their ostensible difficulty adapting to their powers (the Beast subplot, for instance, falls entirely flat as the actor playing the large-footed mutant never really rises above his pretty-boy exterior). It is worth mentioning that the last action sequence lacks total bite as well. Much like the Holocaust opening, the Cold War suspense feels reheated (this is a big ol' historical event in U.S. history so most audience members will know how it ends up, regardless of the mutants' hand in it). In the end, thirteen year old boys should really love this flick, as will anyone who has never seen a movie, read a text book, or delved into the X-Men universe. Everyone else will be mystified by the beautiful CG shots (though expected from a $160 million action film--they never rise to the level of jaw-dropping grace and brutality set forth by Vaughn's recent Kick Ass) and sharp-toothed editing (particularly early on). Anyone else will understand that someone read Robert McKee's plotting tips and fashioned a snapping script for people who would rather be jangled along through slick retro scenarios than to take the time to understand how any of these characters function on an emotional level. Perhaps if the film would have been recut as a Magneto-only story, it would have been much more intriguing and adult. Or perhaps I am ruined by recent deconstructions of the genre (the ultra-violent Super, for instance, which also starred Kevin Bacon as the bad guy). Or with such an A-list of talent, I was expecting more.
B004HWT6DO|4.0|Finally got to see this and found it entertaining, but not much more than that.  This film garnered a lot of undeserved hype which seems to be just as much of an indictment on the shallowness of our culture as the film was.<br /><br />There's nothing groundbreaking about this film.  Flash in the pan entertainment at best.
B005MW53GW|5.0|All the songs was hoping for with a bunch of bonus tracks. My only regret is that I didn't purchase it used so Courtney didn't get a dime. But, her royalties on $4.00 won't be enough to get crack anyway.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Cute - fun game - but I agree with everyone that it stinks that the energy takes so long to refill. If the game is free then I'm not really wanting to pay for every move I make - literally! Creative game otherwise! Just please extend the energy or at least make more ways to earn it!! :)
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This alarm clock was working great until it got PM and AM mixed up causing me to sleep in instead of getting ready. ITS NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING
B001EYU1VO|2.0|Out of the box, this stick seems great. The split throttle design gives you an additional axis of control, the trim wheel is great to have for flight sims, and the button layout is great. The adjust-ability of the stick makes it easy to customize, however the whole thing feels loose due to these adjustable components. The stick is pretty loose, something that I personally don't like. Also, I used to have a Saitek X-52, which featured the same spring/cup design, and it stopped centering properly after a few months of moderate use. I'm not sure the same would have happened to this stick, but I imagine it could be an issue.<br /><br />And now for the real problem: The stick comes in two parts. This seems great for storage purposes, but is a nightmare when it comes to reliability. See that grey ring where the spring meets the grip? That piece screws the grip to the base. It uses several pins to send the inputs from the buttons through the cable. These pins can come unseated during use, and require the stick to be disassembled and then re-assembled in order to fix. I returned my stick to the retailer I bought it from and swapped it for a Logitech Extreme 3D pro, which works and feels great. My advice: Get either the aforementioned Logitech stick, or a Thrustmaster T-Flight.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good. no freezing. not so much advertising. easy to play. kind of like super mario but who cares. i like it.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|A story of good and evil, tender love between a manly man and a feminine but strong woman, and motherly love even for a child not of one's own blood.  Historical, entertaining, sad and happy.  One of my favorite movies.  I will say that when I first saw it I thought it might be a comedy because it's done in a different way but it's worth watching.  Even if you don't fall in love with it like I did, you may enjoy it just enough.
B005CAAURG|5.0|This album will ROCK YOU. Including all of the songs on the EP. Be sure to find the Remix of \\"We Will Rock You\\" from the 1991 CD as well. Listening to the album speaks for itself, and the remaster simply rocks n rolls!
B007FH9GT2|1.0|Great books could not put them down. Maybe a great film can't tell!!!!! Rented from Amazon and streamed it last night, not sure if it was the feed or the movie but I could not hear/understand half of the dialogue sounded like they mumbled throughout. Actually enjoyed the foreign version better at least I could read the subtitles. Could not stand it and ended up turning it off after the first 30 mins.
B004LWZW88|3.0|With nary a mention of his friend \\"Shrek\\" Puss (Antonio Banderas) strikes out on his own as he has become an outlaw.  His best friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) duped him into being an accomplice to a bank robbery.  On the run since, Puss reunites with Hump and his smokin' partner, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).  Reluctantly Puss joins forces in an effort to steal 3 magical beans that when properly planted will grow a giant bean stalk up to the sky.  There, they will find the goose that lays golden eggs.<br /><br />Once recovered, they can repay the town and get the law off their tale.  Not to mention, they would be rich.  Well, rich until the overabundance of gold eggs screws up the economic system with hyper inflation.  This film looks and sounds great.  The Blu ray is magnificent in every way.  Unfortunately, the usual salting of inside jokes for the grown-ups is missing for the most part.  The funniest bits are when the felines do their kitty tricks.  You know, the big sad eyes to counter the more ferocious image. I also liked the bit where Puss saunters into a bar, gets a shot of le leche and instead of shooting it back, laps it just like a kitty.  The movie will play well for the kids, less so for the adults.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Even though the first book was alright, I think the second book was a much better improvement. The repetition was lessened (yet still evident) and the plot was very engaging! There were a lot of gripping moments, but Christian Grey (as a twenty-seven year old) needs to grow up. Guys in there twenties are still immature until they reach their thirties. Ana is still stubborn and naive in many instances. I got really annoyed with Christian's temper tantrums and Ana's foolish mistakes, but I did like the dark stuff in the novel.<br /><br />I believe this book has a lot of twisted elements that should have been evident in the first book.

B005HV6Y84|4.0|I have purchased all the Twilight series soundtracks over the years. This one, like all the others, had to be listened to a few times before I started to appreciate the songs. I find it helpful and pleasurable to picture the scene from the movie while listening to the song. There are a few songs I just don't like, but overall it was a good CD. I also downloaded some of the songs, only the ones I really liked, on amazon mp3. There were extras online that were not available on the CD, like most things. I do not regret this purchase.
0307957934|4.0|I picked up \\"The Fear Index\\" shortly after finishing \\"The Ghost,\\" Harris' earlier thriller-mystery about a ghost writer caught up in international intrigue. (How many times have those last two words been used together to describe a thriller?)<br /><br />\\"The Ghost\\" stayed, for the most part, within itself. The ending was big and cinematic but for the most part the plot had a small, compact feeling.<br /><br />Not so for \\"The Fear Index.\\"<br /><br />Whether you'll like it might depend on how far you are willing to swallow events on The Plausibility Index.<br /><br />This plot cranks the meter up into the shake-your-head-and-swallow-hard red zone, the needle spiked, but Harris manages to make us care about Alex Hoffman who, no matter how rich and powerful, needs redemption and one day begins to discover that he is being invaded and being watched.<br /><br />Events he usually controls are going very much off the rails. So, we care. Or at least, we go for the ride. Harris manages to pack themes about evolution and man-made intelligence into the same plot. The device is obvious and hardly under-stated but, with Harris' strong style, it works.<br /><br />The roiling financial markets are at the heart of \\"The Fear Index\\" but so too is Hoffman's increasingly worried view of all his close acquaintances, a view being tortured and squeezed by the very machines he has programmed to control or at least exploit those very same markets.<br /><br />The ending is a laugh. It's silly and simple and yet somehow satisfying, too.  When all else fails, fetch the gasoline tanks and match. \\"The Fear Index\\" is frothy, foamy and fun.  A frolic.  Swallow hard and keep reading.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Very happy with this DVD set. I enjoyed the commentary of the director and the extras on the 2nd DVD. I know many people were upset that there were no deleted scenes, but this was sufficient. I'm sure when they release part two they'll give us some extras. I don't mind paying again it's worth it to be able to watch this one now any time I like. I think Bill Condon did great. I wondered years ago how any director would be able to deal with and show all the crazy parts in the book. I loved the ending and I can't wait for Part 2.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|it is so fun it give gravity ball so if you miss the pig it will come back around for a second try it is worth the money butt it dont have many wourld yet butt it does say camoing soon for some new worlds.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Awesome show! If you like movies like 300, then you'll definitely love this series!<br />A must for all gore lovers!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Ok, so I did not like the first one but many people encouraged me to give the second one a chance. They said it gets better but that was not the case. Ana is still an immature, annoying, girl. And Christian, my god, he turned bipolar. One minute he is brooding, then he is on the floor acting like her slave, crying for her. This completely ruined the character for me. What is with the eye roll Ana? Are you 13 years old? And the biting of the lip that turns Christian on, that makes me want to roll my eyes. I didn't buy the romance between Ana and Christian in the first book and I still don't. Why does a guy as successful and mature as Christian want with a little girl like Ana? Especially when he has previously dated women. It is disturbing. Plus, I didn't like the room of pain and didn't understand why Ana freaked out at the end of the first one when she was aware of Christian's predilections. Then she wants really badly to go back in there. So apparently Ana's friend, boss, and Christian's employee have feelings for her and the girl with an \\"inner goddess\\" is shocked. In the first book she did not want Christian to buy her things but that didn't last long. In this book, she loves wearing the clothes Christian bought for her to work and having his maid pack her lunch. They still continue the pointless email exchanges and Mr. Grey, Ms. Steele from the first book. I feel nothing for the characters and frankly don't care what happens to them. As with the first one, it took me 2 months to finish this book b/c it was so boring. I really wanted to get into this series but it just comes off as an amatuerish effort at writing. I heard the first one is being made into a movie. I congratulate the author on the success of the series. It's too bad that it wasn't for me. I strongly recommend that you bypass this series and read Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire.<br /><br />This was originally written as a fanfiction of the Twilight characters. If you want to read this book, youcan find the fanfiction online and READ IT FOR FREE. The only difference is that Ana is Bella and Christian is Edward.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Looking for a durable cover for your Fire? I highly recommend this one. We gave our son a Fire for his birthday, and I bought this cover at the same time. Can't say enough good about it. His Fire still looks like new, and this cover takes the beatings in stride. You can't tell it's been dropped repeatedly (even on sidewalks and driveways), and the seams don't show any signs of stress. When Amazon makes the Fire with 3G (or 4G!), I'll order mine too - along with this cover!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is getting so much buzz but I don't get it. It was boring and the characters weren't unique. It took me 2 months to finish b/c it could not hold my interest. Ana is not very likable and what the hell is \\"an inner goddess\\". I only associate that with someone in their 40s who desperately wants to cling to their youth. The romance between Ana and Christian wasn't believable. They kept calling each other Ms. Steele and Mr. Grey which didn't make any sense. Was that suppose to be flirting cause it want on for the whole book. Plus, their email exchanges were painful to read. Ana and Christian are described as being very intelligent but their dialogue with each other is just immature, especially, Ana. Furthermore, the description of the contract was too long. I found myself skimming a lot b/c I was so bored. There is a sex scene while Ana has her period that was disgusting. By the way, we are suppose to believe that a girl who has an \\"inner goddess\\" is shocked that her friend has feelings for her. I really really tried to like this book but it just comes off as an amatuer's attempt at writing a story.<br /><br />Apparently this was originally a fanfiction based on the Twilight characters. If you really want to read this you can find the fanfiction online and READ IT FOR FREE. The only difference is that Ana is Bella and Christian is Edward.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not the type of book I would normally read but I found myself hurrying to get back to it. It's an easy read  and I'm  now on book three, love the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to Mario bros. good fun and a way to pass the time. easy controls and just a good game in general!
0451169514|5.0|Make no mistake: if you don't like Stephen King's writing (even a LITTLE bit), you'll hate this. But if you're a fan, ths is like a gift from above. You can just sit down, settle in, and read for what seems like forever. And it doesn't drag, either. Not even for a moment. This is a masterpiece.
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is the story of a family's journey through life told through the eyes of their beloved dog Enzo. Stein's personification of Enzo throughout this novel brings a beautiful innocence to the telling of a story that is both heartwarming and heartwrenching.<br /><br />Enzo is used to having his owner Denny all to himself, but when he marries Eve, Enzo has to adjust to sharing the time and attention he is accustomed to. As Denny and Eve's lives unfold, and they welcome their daughter Zoe into the world, Enzo comes to love them all dearly, so when tragedy strikes and all their lives are turned upside down, Enzo's unconditional love helps them through. At times you will cry, but at others you will catch yourself laughing out loud. I think everybody will enjoy this book, but particularly so if you love animals or have a pet of your own! Stein's reflections on life, love and loss are made all the more poignant by the telling of this family's story through the childlike innocence of Enzo's eyes.
B000002GWJ|5.0|A very good album.  It is well produced, the songs are well writtten and sung in a personal<br />unique style with an excellent musical accompanyment.
0618871713|5.0|Okay, it is written and sold as a comic/illustrated graphic novel.  Get over that.  This book has soul, and is written in attempt for the author to understand her deceased father, and the cryptic legacy he left his daughter.<br /><br />Alison learns both about herself, but more importantly and it is conveyed here:  she learns about her family and those all very important relations.<br /><br />I love this book.  Seriously.
B000002GY9|5.0|Tom Waits delivers again with another well written and performed album.  The songs are<br />personal, universal, and unique.  It  is not easy listening music, but it is easy to listen to, and the band is tight<br />and mellow. Check out the samples to see what you think.

B005OTGS4E|4.0|It kind of uncanny the start . Open up with the bit of battle . Losing friends trying to get back to base. Really rough being told to get back to the fight. Introduce to Fleming 's top squad . His best man put in charge . Lives of soldiers in war and what dealt with.  What they went through to get ready for their assignment . What happens when the mission goes array. Scenic background awesome. Fighting close to vest  rough  pushy. Doing all they can with what the got win or lose.  Lot of quick thinking, action, losing those men and no one knowing except their family.  Truly gripping . Wives and family dealing with lost. Emptiness! Lost of good men that would not be rewarded for their valor and loyalty.

1451683405|5.0|Never mind whether or not you agree (and be warned: this topic seems to evoke very strong reactions, the type that tend to overwhelm any argument, no matter how reasonable, on either side of the issue...), the more important thing about this short, virtually perfect book is that Harris writes about a nearly impenetrable subject with pure clarity. As you are reading, everything is wonderfully straightforward, wonderfully plain. And you can't help wanting to pick the book up again and again. One gets the impression that Harris could write on any subject and make it interesting.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|It is a great story, but this set of books drives me NUTS.  I am currently reading Book 2.  I cannot tell you how many times, I'll start reading and my Kindle has somehow gone to BOOK FOUR!

B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I think what ruined this adaptation for me was Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Mr. Rochester.  My favorite version (although flawed as well) starred Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester and I remember reading a strange review from a major publication that stated he was almost too pretty for the role!  I find that review stranger still when I think of this production!<br /><br />Fassbender may be all right as a cad in Ozon's Angel and even possibly films with contemporary settings; but his modern spin on Mr. Rochester was very jarring.  Even before I did research on the actor, I kept thinking, \\"Oh, he's using physiognomy (certain aspects of which he appears inordinately proud) to create this character.\\"  But the anatomical parts he kept subtly emphasizing would create a subconscious discord with any almost any modern romantic teenaged heroine let alone a young virginal girl possessing early Victorian mores and outlook.  I kept feeling that Fassbender's modern individual personality was bleeding though the character of Mr. Rochester and I disliked both the character of M. Rochester and the man who played him intensely.  It's a reaction I rarely have when I see a professional production, but time after time I kept sensing the duality of the man who played Rochester.  I was suspended in time watching Mr. Rochester, or was I watching a sell-satisfied man playing Rochester?  The whole point of acting is that you dislike the character but intuitively know it's, well, an act.  For such a major role as Mr. Rochester, this duality destroyed the film.  If you wish to play Casanova, by all means play him.  But play Mr. Rochester as Mr. Rochester.  Jamie Bell's portrayal of St. John Rivers got the whole tension thing right without being too overt. Mia Wasikowska also gave a good performance.  I love Judi Dench, but I thought her acting here was sloppy and not up to her prior fine performances.  Fortunately, she performed a minor role as Mrs. Fairfax and perhaps she thought she was to great of an actress to play such a minor role.<br /><br />Excellent cinematography, use of sets, costumes, and editing.

B006RXQASA|5.0|I somehow don't think even getting on the ground and bowing down to the pure unadulterated genius of Kevin Smith would be enough in the way of thanking him for this movie - To say it is funny would be a huge understatement, to say it is you me and that guy - you know the one...the one who is always lurking.... - would be more to the point. Its a movie about life and when one has a few moments to step back and really look at what we are doing, saying, where we are going, and how we are getting there you can really see the utter humor of it all. \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today\\" is/was the moniker of us all at one point or another in our lives and this movie is about those funny, odd, trying to act grownup moments we have all had.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of if not the best book i've ever read. Have not finished yet but love it. I bought it for my kindle fire, because I plan on reading it again. Don't want it to end!!!
B00005JM4Z|4.0|I enjoy watching 2 Fast 2 Furious. I think I like it more then the first Fast and Furious. What I like more about it is the story the movie plays. A little bit more drama. My fav. scene is when they are running from the cop's. They go into a building and a bunch of car's come out to distract the cop's so they can get away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read. I would recommend it for kids 10 and above, because of the graphic parts. The storyline is perfect, and the world is amazing beyond what you can imagine. Suzanne Collins has created a masterpiece.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The dark night isn't bad for a batman movie. For those who don't know, The dark Night is the last movie that Heath Ledger played. It is sad, and no disrespect to him or his family. At less he did a great job acting in his last movie. Otherwise people would be talking about his movie not making a big smash before he died.<br />  R.I.P. Heath Ledger
B0055SWM08|5.0|I play this very often .<br /> It is very challenging, but not too challenging. When playing this remember to have patience.Have fun!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|Fast and Furious is a good movie. Fun to watch. After watching this movie I always find my self day dreaming of having a nice car to roll in. To look good in. To drive crazy in. Back to reality I'm still stuck with my little white Kia.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the best but it take a awhile to get going.  wating for energy is very hard.!  I am glad its free.!
B000HA4WT8|5.0|A lot of people are hating on this movie. But I thought it wasn't bad. A lot of people have told me they don't consider Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift one of Fast and Furious movie. I don't see why not. It still has car's. LOL what a girl thing to say. I enjoyed it.

0307352145|5.0|Fantastic!  Why has it taken so long for this book to be written?  \\"Quiet\\" systematically tackles the topic of introversion from a number of angles: history, culture, psychology, sociology, biology, family and workplace.  The book is well researched and well presented.  It does not come across as pop-psychology but is very accessible nevertheless.<br /><br />I am an introvert.  And on a personal level this book resonates with me.  Sure, like many, I've learned to function in an extroverted world.  But it is freeing to know that it is okay to be an introvert.  It is not a character flaw; it is just part of who I am.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to introverts, extroverts and to those who don't know which they are.  There is great advice that is helpful in family situations as well as in the workplace.  Everyone should read \\"Quiet\\".  Okay, leave me alone now, I want to be alone and think!<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group through their Blogging for Books program.
B00006G8HX|4.0|I am biased.  I love anything Star Trek.  The loyalty that has been portrayed by the Original ST  crew is second to none.  It even helps to put in proper context my favorite scene in the whole movie.  Not to say what happens when these words are spoken because I do not want to spoil it for anyone; but they are as Follows:  Kirk:  My god what have I done?  McCoy: You did what you had to do, what you always do; turn certain death, into a fighting chance for life.  The act that prompts this exchange is a profound moment in mythos of Star Trek.  It makes one think of the James T.  Kirk who does not believe in the \\"No Win scenario\\"  While many have earned the right to be called  Star Fleet Captain, James T Kirk will always have a special place in my heart, because of this movie.  I will add that one day while waiting to get into a studio taping of a daytime  talk show William Shatner  walked by me and \\"I did brush the hem of his garment\\"  and I was as speechless not because it was William Shatner but because in my mind it was James T Kirk and it don't get no better than that.
0425241505|3.0|\\"Dragon Bound\\" had potential.  The plot was interesting enough, but the writing was awkward.  Some of the descriptions left me scratching my head.  What exactly is a \\"machete smile\\"?  Ms. Harrison must know, since the term is used over and over. So much of it felt forced, without the kind of effortless flow that makes a book enjoyable.  I had to struggle to get through.  To be honest, I felt that the secondary characters were more interesting and likable than the protagonists. Maybe the author will hit her stride in the next book of the series.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I am a huge fan of hidden object games and this one, by far, takes the cake.

6305313687|5.0|This is not just a film about racism, it's a film about how hate is such a destructive force, it can destroy your life bit by bit until you have nothing left.  When Derek's teacher asks him, \\"Has anything you've done made your life better?\\" Derek finally awakes from a long hate fueled trance.  What we then see is a man that finally wants to change his life, and the life of the people that he has ruined around him, his family.<br /><br />American History X is a brutally honest and raw account of a young man who joins a violent white supremacist group that primarily enlists young people.  They go around committing violent and racist acts, and the leader fuels their energy with hate.  This is, without a doubt, Ed Norton's finest performance.  It is one with such energy and madness that he literally seems at times to come off the screen.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen, and without a doubt, should have won best picture and actor that year.<br /><br />It's a terrifying account of how brainwashing and manipulation by hate can ruin your life, and that of everyone around you.
0062073559|5.0|Eh bien! I figured it out! I actually came up with the correct killer, or killers shortly after The millionaire heiress, Linnet Doyle was found shot in the head on page 148. I didn't need all the clues used by our beloved Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. I got lucky and guessed based upon Agatha Christie's past tendencies. Mais Oui, it will never happen again. If you notice, I'm using all of Hercule's favorite French exclamations. This 1937 detective/mystery novel is first class, as usual. Our pyknic mustached French speaking gumshoe once again sifts through many suspects and clues to nail his man, or woman ( I'm not giving you the murderer, or murderess! ). This time he has a Colonel Race to use as his sounding board and a German Doctor Bessner as his medical advisor. What a' merveille entertaining novel this is!!<br /><br />Hercule is on vacation in Egypt awaiting a cruise down the Nile, when he meets twenty year old Linnet Ridgeway and her husband, Simon Doyle. It seems Simon recently detached himself from Linnet's best friend, Jacqueline de Bellefort to marry the very rich Linnet. Now the jeune fille Jacqueline is stalking the newlyweds and the Doyles want Hercule's help. Hercule refuses the commission but says he will talk to Jacqueline. Hercule is unable to tranquil the rejected Jacqueline and in fact she threatens to kill Linnet. Later, on the steamer Karnak, Linnet turns up dead, shot in the head! Zut! Now our portly Hercule is on the case! The race is on to find the killer before someone else turns up dead. Most of the characters in this story are very exotic, and the clues are portentous and numerous. The ensuing chapters are all cliffhangers with fresh clues resulting in new suspects.<br /><br />Agatha's ability to develop characters is amazing, and consistent in all her books. Can't you picture Peter Lorre, or Sydney Greenstreet in one of her novels? One of her few rivals during the 1930's was Dashiell Hammett, author of one of my favorites,\\"The Maltese Falcon\\". Another astonishing trait Agatha commands is that all her suspects come to full closure at the novel's end. I hate when I finish a book and most of characters have disappeared without a proper arrestment. Anyway mon ami, and mon amie, I give this mystery a hi-five!! Do yourself a favor and read a Agatha Christie novel soon- you will love it.e Falcon\\". Another astonishing trait Agatha commands is that all her suspects come to full closure at the novel's end.

B007P3TMW2|1.0|Had I not rented this movie in a hotel room, for a ridiculous price, I would have walked out. This was simply painful to watch. A story that revolved around a truly disturbed, precocious, rude, neurotic child who also happened to be grieving due to his loss of his father 9/11. The ending was the most watchable part. Horrible flick. (and I love Tom Hanks!)

0345803485|5.0|I will admit, I had heard about this book, and read some reviews and dismissed it. Then a friend asked me if i read it and told me I had to try it. Well I did..and my family didn't see me for three days. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOKS DOWN! I head all three in three days. Agree with some of the reviews on here...completely and totally addictive. I wish she would have written more. I would totally recommend to my friends to read it.
B007JRU2UK|1.0|I thought this movie was going to have some substance but it lacked this plus a lot more.  Glad I only paid $1 at the maxisaver movie theater.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love the You Version of the bible, however the app has done nothing but constantly crash on my T Mobile 4g phone and after installing it and then uninstalling it and reinstalling it numerous times, I've just given up using the app because it just crashes constantly.<br /><br />I have numerous bible apps on my phone and none of the other bible apps I have do this.  Maybe if they could fix the bugs on this one, I'd reinstall it and keep it.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|This movie is a great sequel to Tron and very well made. Great casting, excellent visuals, amazing score, great story. It's simply a well made movie, and the effort from everyone involved shows.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It's a love story between a witch who fell in love with a vampire. The main character Diana is a historian who researches Alchemy. She stumbles upon a book that everyone in the supernatural world has been looking for and after reading it briefly returns it. This starts the crazy whirlwind of a plot. We are taken to many places and really see the character grow.<br /><br />Now I really really enjoyed this book. I had already skimmed some reviews and was forewarned about Diana's weird personality flips in the book when she was falling in love, but these things change so much by the time the Bishop house comes into play that I feel like maybe she was just growing as person. Adjusting to this new idea of what loving Matthew will be for her.<br /><br />The descriptions in this book were amazing! The amount of detail giving to the books Diana uses in her research and alchemy in general just blew me away. I was so pleased that the author really took care to be accurate in her details of things involving alchemy from a long time ago.<br /><br />The plot was interesting. I really enjoyed how it all started out with the book being missing. And slowly developed into this huge overarching plot that is obviously what will be detailed in following books. It really brought me into the story and got me excited to see where all this would end up.<br /><br />The main problems I had with the book was the middle part really lagged and left me bored. I just kept going okay when is this going to finally pick up? I also was flustered by Diana's lack of knowledge about why she couldn't use her powers until I learned the real reasoning. Though that was one of the reasons I kept reading the book. It kept me attached and wanting to know more, but still annoyed at her lack of knowledge in some aspects.<br /><br />Overall I loved this book. I can't wait for the second book to come out. I've grown quite fond of all the characters involved and think the overarching plot line will prove to be incredibly interesting especially since Diana really grew as a character I felt by the end of this book. She no longer felt whiney or powerless to me. She finally was becoming the goddess she was named after.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Every few years I bounce back and forth between Intel and AMD processors depending, usually, on what's on sale at the time I build a new PC. This time around, I needed a PC that will run in our RV for full-time use over a 4G cell connection and I needed a processor capable of running multiple virtual machines at once, so I elected to go for the FX 8120 processor and wow... just wow. This processor is amazing! Especially when paired with the right motherboard (I paired mine with the ASUS Sabertooth 990FX) - this is one of their black processors - unlocked and ready to overclock - and it handles overclocking surprisingly well with a water cooler attached - though it might run equally well with the heat pipe design CPU fan that comes with this processor. Worth every penny.
0385534639|5.0|This was such a beautiful jewel that I just wanted to hold it and enjoy the glow. It captivated me from the start and I didn't want it to put it down even when I was at the end. Without a doubt..my favorite book ever! Really. I felt like I was there, like the world around me now was magical and when we find a book that can do that for us it is truly a gift. I'm looking for more.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book provided some solid reaffirmation that some of the things we have been doing have been right (even through several market crashes)and wisdom for decisions we must make at this time in our lives.  However, it is not about being a millionaire so much as it is about maximizing our net worth, being responsible human beings. Not everybody will be a millionaire but we would be so much better off financially, and even morally if we heeded the lessons in this book.  Live on less than you make.  Don't spend all your money and money you don't have trying to create an image and fulfill temporary pleasures.  Get out of debt as soon as you can.  Let's face it, in the end it's all temporary anyway. Following this book's principles may not make you a millionaire, but you will be a lot more comfortable financially than you would be otherwise.<br /><br />I skipped and hopped through this book, just mining the nuggets because there are so many statistics, etc.  I recommend this book highly to anyone and my adult children are going to get a copy.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game but the energy rating sucks so you cant do much the more into the game you get. other than that its pretty fun :)

B0071WQ7WU|1.0|This is by far the worst Shinedown album.  I was going to give it two stars, but compared with any of their earlier works, it does not even deserve that.  Totally uninspiring.  Would like to go see them live again, but do not want to hear any of this garbage live.  Oh well, after so many great albums, I guess they were overdue for a dud.  Let's hope they can get their stuff together on the next one.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I liked the idea, so i bought it. I tried some blue beer bottles(forget it), regular beer bottles, wine cooler bottles. I only had luck with wine bottles. They are thinner and expand easier. Or it may be the class cuter part itself is cheap. Maybe ill try again. Its alot harder than it looks.

0374532990|5.0|Three years later, still an essential book to a gem in New York City. Here is a link to the revised edition; there have been many changes and the updated edition is now essential.  [[ASIN:0500291411 On the High Line: Exploring America's Most Original Urban Park (Revised Edition) ]]<br /><br />My original review is still accurate for this version:<br /><br />As a life member of the New York New Jersey Trail Conference, I'm always on the lookout for new hiking opportunities and projects. Over the years I've hiked around the perimeter of Manhattan four times, the last time in 1999 when on a rest stop I found a short note about something called the Friends of the High Line. I became a Friend, and learned many of the details of the project first hand. The current statement of purpose for the Friends reads:<br /><br />&#34;Friends of the High Line works to build and maintain an extraordinary public park on the High Line. We seek to preserve the entire historic structure, transforming an essential piece of New York's industrial past. We provide over 90 percent of the High Line's annual operating budget and are responsible for maintenance of the park, pursuant to a license agreement with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation. Through stewardship, innovative design and programming, and excellence in operations, we cultivate a vibrant community around the High Line.&#34;<br /><br />Boy, have the Friends ever succeeded. Almost any day of the year, the park is jammed with tourists and New Yorkers alike. It has become a mecca for urban life in the City with dozens and dozens of stories, some of them almost unbelieveable.<br /><br />This beautifully produced hard cover book details many of those stories, and it contains dozens of beautiful pictures documenting the construction and the finished portions of the park. At first sight, I thought that was all it might be, a coffee table book of pretty pictures. It's that, of course, although not a large as a real coffee table book, but the substance is superb. You can learn a great deal about how ordinary citizens can make a tremendous contribution to the improvement of their cities, and much of it with no governmental help at all.<br /><br />The future looks very bright. The Friends are committed to continuing the High Line to the north; I always end at the northern end looking longingly over the rusting metal trestles and dreaming about how beautiful it will be when that extension matches the glories to the south.<br /><br />What a wonderful park! What a wonderful book!<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />April 2012<br />revised March 2015<br /><br />Addendum: An interesting description of the hike around Manhattan, about 33 miles, 12 hours, was written by Cy Adler, Walking Manhattan's Rim: The Great Saunter. A bit dated, but still useful. R.ble book, but the substance is superb.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am truly enjoying this game. Keeps mind off of things. Kids will love it. Needs more ways though to get energy instead of spending money.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|A really addicting game but you run out of energy too quickly you should be able to have a lot more energy... If it weren't for that I'd give it 5 stars!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this because I wanted a very low profile clean case. It is slim and well fit. I do not think it would do much for a big drop but for basic bumps and dings it does the trick. Exactly what I wanted. Very pleased.

0312641893|4.0|I love fairytale retellings, especially when they are fresh and new. Cinder is an amazing retelling that takes places in a dark world.<br /><br />The world the author created for this story is amazing, dark, and beautiful. It's set in the future, post apocalyptic where everything is created with technology. The story is full of mystery and romance. I was pulled in deep from the beginning.<br /><br />Cinder is strong character; independent, sarcastic, and only a small percentage human. She lives with her stepmother and two stepsisters. Her stepmother uses and abuses her and her oldest stepsister hates her. She is close to the younger stepsister who ends up sick with a deadly disease with no known clue. Cinder will do whatever she needs to help find a cure for her little sister. Her sister is the only human that she cares for. That is until she meets Prince Kai.<br /><br />The romance between Cinder and Prince Kai is not love at first sight. This is something I really enjoyed about this book. It was fun to watch the romance bloom. So many young adult books these days have \\"love at first sight\\", I know teens are pretty dramatic about everything they do, but as an adult I am well aware \\"love at first sight\\" is very very very rare, if it exists at all.<br /><br />Prince Kai was great for me. He is smart and gentle. He loves and admires beyond boundaries. He is not above the common people and cares deeply for his father and his kingdom.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next installment. A little impatiently I must say, since this book ended with a \\"no that's not it, is it?\\" moment.

B007A2O3FO|5.0|This movie is delightful, superbly written and filmed, with first-rate performances from Maggie Smith, Alex Etel, Hugh Bonneville, Timothy Spall, et al.  And, since a another reviewer has done a fine job of describing characters and events, suffice to say that thanks to all involved in this production, the movie is so engrossing and entertaining it seemed to be over before I knew it.  It's a gem.
0545123291|4.0|It's been more than a year since I've read Shiver, and I wasn't really planning on reading its sequel or the third book in the trilogy when they came out. But during the summer I won a copy of Forever, the third book, and decide to just buy a copy of Linger and read them. I didn't hate or even dislike Shiver. Actually, I'm not even sure why I didn't automatically buy Linger.<br /><br />Unfortunately I started out this book almost unbearably confused. I read the first book so long ago and read so many book after, that I forgot a lot of the major plot happenings. I had to do a bit of research to get everything straightened out in my mind, though this wasn't the book's fault of course. What was the book's fault was that NOTHING happened until the end. It was all just a whole bunch of build up for something that we all knew was going to happen anyway. So, I was often bored because books need plot right?<br /><br />I understand that a lot of the book focused on character development and suspense building and all that jazz. But the suspense was ruined because readers are smart. The character development was okay, but it accounted for too much of the book. The only thing that it did was make my emotions a bit higher when very bad or very good things happened to them. Adding a new character to the mix was a great idea, because without his and Isabelle's side plot, I don't know if I could have made it. Every chapter about Sam and Grace felt the same as the one before it. Cole's and Isabelle's brought continuing excitement.<br /><br />The ending was nice and makes me really want to read Forever, which I guess is good for a book that isn't a standalone to do. Because when things WERE happening? I really liked this book. I was caught off guard by the boring-ness of the second book in a trilogy. Unless Forever is jam packed with action, I don't know why there need to be three books.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book but wasn't excited about the lack of action. The first book was so mysterious and sweet, but Linger just laid it all out. Maybe if I would have read it closer to reading Shiver, I would have cared more about the characters.<br /><br />[...]Linger just laid it all out.

B0067QPVD2|1.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A prequel to the 1982 version of John Carpenter's The Thing, as 2 Americans join a Norwegian camp in the Antarctic and uncovers a Alien spacecraft and Thing that lurks inside.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />What made John Carpenter's version such an amazing film is the trust, paranoia, and the unexpected, in terms of what form The Thing will take shape. Unfortunately, this version relies on one weak clich&eacute; after another, blatantly copying scenes out of the original, to the point I could telegraph what will happen next. The acting is uncharismatic and The Thing itself uses pretty poor CGI, which appears too bright. Remember the awesome music from the original? Yeah, it's nothing like that in this one, it's mostly generic and forgettable. Which are two words that come to mind, that describes the film as well. It is such a disappointment this film wasn't in capable hands, as the concept of a prequel was good. If life was a game of Monopoly, the writer and director of this film should be sent immediately to jail, not passing go and not collecting 200 hundred dollars.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The ending where it ties the two versions, backed by a familiar musical theme.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />This is a prequel to the John Carpenter film 'The Thing', whist that film was the second adaptation of the novella \\"Who Goes There?\\" by John W. Campbell Jr., published in 1938.

B005J9ZE5I|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Sole survivor Ash returns to the abandoned cabin with his girlfriend Linda. Once again he unknowingly plays the tape containing demon resurrection passages from the Necronomicon or 'Book of the Dead'. With chainsaw and boomstick in hand can Ash stop the demonic force that dwells in the woods?<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Looks like a remake but actually is a sequel to 'The Evil Dead'. Raimi gives us even more deviating camera feats; kind of like being stuck in a tumble dryer on full speed, and the results are spectacular. 'Evil Dead 2' has the ability to scare the hell out of you one minute and then laugh your arse off the next, this mix of action, horror and slapstick comedy is the perfect blend. Bruce Campbell gives a great comedic performance, contorting his face with hilarious results as we witness the rise of Ash the cult hero. There is also plenty of gross-out gore and buckets of blood to keep the gore hounds extremely entertained.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />You'll laugh out loud as Ash's possessed right hand trys to kill him; ridiculously funny!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Sam Raimi makes a cameo as the first Medieval Knight to raise his sword and hail Ash.

0385737955|2.0|I bought this book expecting a dystopic kind of story that could potentially capture my attention the way The Hunger Games did.  Unfortunately that was not the case.  I found myself annoyed by the main character, Thomas.  I also found myself annoyed with his inner monologue.  The story was not captivating, and there is little invested in the characters.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|In some ways what's most phenomenal about this music is its stylistic range. Bruce fuses his traditional sounds of R&B, gospel and Irish folk with more contemporary influences to often magnificent results. The ultra-catchy R&B of \\"Rocky Ground\\" features the inspired vocals of Michelle Moore and its brief rapping interlude gives the track further heft. The lovely piano-based and quiet-brass ballad, \\"Jack of All Trades\\", takes an unexpected twist near the end with Tom Morello's guitar solo providing a terrific outro.<br /><br />Of course, there's Bruce's trademark big-band sound on the wonderful \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", in which he questions whether or not we really do. And then there's the heavy production number, \\"Land of Hopes and Dreams\\", where he incorporates the Impressions anthem, \\"People Get Ready\\", and where he just might be one of the few left to carry that torch. Bless Clarence Clemons on this one!<br /><br />Given his age, Bruce projects his voice with as much character as he ever has and, subsequently, he doesn't feel detached from these songs. Even in his position, he remains astute in that conflict has and will always be fought. What's more, this is a better thought-out record than he's presented in years and this should prove that he's not getting a free pass on name recognition. He's back with a great one that has a major statement.

B007JUWM64|1.0|I like adventure/action movies and at least 2 of the actors in this movie (Stevenson and MacFayden) I have seen in other high quality productions. But this movie is just bad. The story-line is meant to \\"up-date\\" Dumas' story, the numerous older movie versions and make use of new technology (i.e., appeal to a younger demographic). But for all the glitz and explosions, it plods along like an old horse. On very big problem is the lead played by Logan Leman. I am sure he is talented but this was not a good role for him. He was stiff, unconvincing and incredibly dull to watch. The other actors too were bogged down by a very poorly written script. There was a (in my view) a very obvious attempt to mimic the humor in the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movies. The \\"new and improved\\" story-line was hard to follow and just plain boring. The thing is this is a good story and it could have been a terrific movie. I really have to wonder how this went from \\"neat concept\\" to \\"crappy movie\\".

0393064476|2.0|After reading the book, I read the NYTimes review. It  seems to me too charitable to G.  [...]<br />The review calls it \\"a volume of apple-cheeked popular intellectual history.\\" Even so, the book's intellectual component (if we're talking about the history of ideas) is limited to the summary of Lucretian philosophy plus a few broken links in \\"Afterlives,\\" that together amount to some undissolved sugar lumps in the reviewer's metaphor: \\"This book is well-brewed coffee with plenty of milk and sugar stirred in; it's a latte, not an espresso.\\"<br /><br />None of my expectations were realized. To my surprise, the summary of Lucretius' poem and ideas absorbed my attention and engaged my brain to read analytically. Wonderful. But surprisingly, the early promise of manuscript-related themes (parchment, calligraphy, transmission) swerved to mini-bios of Poggio, his teacher, the teacher's teacher, family, and then to what the reviewer calls \\"worthwhile detours\\" into papal history, saints'  lives, vignettes, political & cultural episodes, all being little stories void of ideas, Lucretian or otherwise.<br /><br />G. claims that the Codex Laurentianus is \\"one of the key sources of modernity\\" (204). 50 ms copies are sources of 15th-16th cent. printed eds.  and others later, so that by 1689 \\"L's discovery had already long been helping to unsettle and transform the world\\" (205). He never demonstrates how. As to Petrarch's major participation in the Humanist movement that did have impact, he tries to demystify it. He says that Poggio was denied access after sending it to his patron Niccoli, and when he gets it, date unknown, \\"On The Nature of Things slowly made its way once again into the hands of readers about a thousand years after it had dropped out of sight\\" (209). The immediate remainder of the chapter (10pp) swerves back to P's life, mistress, chancellorship, and entry into the Italian pantheon. The next chapter, \\"Swerves\\" begins with Savonarola as background. Then, \\"By the 1490s, then, some 60 or 70 years after L's poem was returned to circulation [but G. said it was in Niccolo's & P's hands: in what way was it returned?], atomism was sufficiently present in Florence to make it worth ridiculing. Its presence did not mean that its suppositions were openly embraced as true...But these subversive, Lucretian thoughts speculated and surfaced wherever the Renaissance imagination was at its most alive and intense\\" (220). How? Where? Absent is any connecting example of influence, a genealogy. He cites Ficino, but F. was a Platonist. More's Utopia, as explicated by G. does not reveal much of L's meaningful influence. Even if it did, what connection is there between F and M? And how does Montaigne fit into the chronology or chain of events or transmissive tradition or whatever it is called that constitutes even \\"popular intellectual history\\"? Merely to read L. is not to be influenced. Catholic Spain also read L., even had a school of atomists among the battling theological schools. Then there is Galileo, who indeed helped to change history's direction. Greenblatt's scholarship here is notable: while the body of the text uses the recently discovered memo that Galileo's atomism was the real reason for the verdict, Greenblatt's footnote says this argument is refuted by historians of science. G. then justifies himself. The average reader would probably stop at the body of the text and believe G. (BTW, in connection with G's scholarship, his detractors will surely notice that everything he includes in his book derives from information already published by other scholars. I do, however, credit him for ferreting out many of his references, which to an outsider appear obscure. And he did go to the library and handle the ms. with gloves!)<br /><br />What makes this book a disaster, if not a fraud (subtitle: \\"How the world became modern\\") is G's lack of definition of Lucretianism. Is it philosophical materialism? If so, define it. Is it limited to physics?(the material structure of the universe). Is it a form of hedonism? In what way? (e.g., relative to Seneca's or Horace's thought). Is it the denial of a soul and the afterlife? The love of poetic beauty? An intellectual historian does not swerve from one to another component as it suits him in haphazard manner, never parsing a single one of these elements. From what I can make out after reading G.'s final chapters is that by the time the \\"modern\\" or the \\"secular\\" gained a foothold, it was limited to Newtonian physics, whose atomistic vocabulary derives from L. Otherwise, the pleasure principle as found in the Renaissance lyric cannot be attributed to L. in a major way. (Here I will submit to correction). Such trends are always the result of confluences, making untenable any thesis that makes one work or author the lone source.

031237674X|4.0|It's more scientific than Return from Heaven by Carol Bowman. Her book is more spiritual. This one is good but only a few things I don't like. What I like is that it goes into detail of each possible explanation you can think of for the paranormal experiences of reincarnation. It talks about his research in detail, how they gather data, what they do with it, etc... The stories are good examples of reincarnation but what I don't like is that there are a few stories that shouldn't be used in this book. They are more than just unrealistic, more like fantasy stories that you would hear about in a Disney movie. That's my main problem and only problem with the book. There are only a very few stories like this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is the perfect book for a Kindle, because I'd be embarrassed if anyone saw me reading this book. It's true, the inner goddess, the sub-conscious and the excessive use of &#34;crap&#34; is really annoying. But I've always been interested in BDSM. Not to try it!! But from a pop-psychology stand point. What kinds of issues do the people that do it have, what would compel someone to be a dominant or submissive? This, and the evolution of the main characters, is what made me like this book, despite how bad it is. it reminds me of Dexter, Twilight, and Something Borrowed all rolled into one. If you like those, you'll probably like this book, and hey, it's only ten bucks. Think of it like going to a movie.

0439023513|4.0|Not since \\"Twilight\\" have I been asked so much about a series. Practically everyday someone asks me if I have read the \\"Hunger Games\\" and if so, what do I think about it? Unlike with \\"Twilight,\\" my feelings on this series are not so clear-cut. My emotions were really mixed after reading the first book in the trilogy so I decided to wait until I'd read all three before attempting to articulate my feelings. I felt very differently about each book, so I'm glad I waited before writing the review. There were things I loved about these books and things I didn't love so much. I will start with the things I loved:<br /><br />Collins' characterization was spot on. I connected almost immediately to Katniss and understood the depth of who she was and what she was about. I wasn't at all surprised when she took her sister's place in the reaping because Collins had done a great job of setting this up. I  knew Katniss would do whatever it took to protect Prim. I also deeply connected with Peeta. Can I just take a minute and say that I loved him? I was a fan of his from the get-go. Haymitch was another character who was greatly developed. And, while we didn't get to know Gale much in the first book, by the third book I had a good understanding of him as well.<br /><br />If you've read many of my reviews you know that I'm a sucker for love triangles and this one was superbly done. I definitely felt the conflicting emotions Katniss had for both Peeta and Gale. While my feelings were clearly in Peeta's favor, I felt like the love triangle was believable and it kept me glued to the pages.<br /><br />The last thing I loved about the books was how compulsively readable they were. I couldn't put them down. However, I've read numerous books that I couldn't put down. The difference is that oftentimes I feel a sense of loss when I finish a book or series I love. I wish so badly that I could keep reading about the characters I've grown to love. Not so with these books. I read them quickly because I  desperately wanted them to be over. The premise was so disturbing that I had to know if Katniss would survive and at what cost.<br /><br />The thing I didn't like about the books was how sick to my stomach I felt while reading them. The premise was extremely dark and depressing and I didn't feel like there was ever any hope. I felt this mostly in the first book, which was my least favorite. In \\"Catching Fire\\" I almost abandoned it halfway through when I thought it would just be a regurgitation of the first one but then Collins surprised me and the book started going in another, more hopeful direction. This made my happy and I loved how this book ended. The third book started out great, but about halfway through the story took a turn that angered me. It redeemed itself though and I did love how it ended. I wished some of the things had happened differently but overall, \\"Mockingjay's\\" ending was very satisfying.<br /><br />Overall, I think Collins did an amazing job with this trilogy. I wouldn't have had such strong feelings about the novels if she hadn't done such an awesome job with the characters, imagery, action and details. I would recommend these books, but be warned - they are difficult, gruesome reads and are not for the faint of heart.<br />Amber Garza - author of the PROWL trilogy - YA Thrillersause I  desperately wanted them to be over.

B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Just wanted to add to the reviews here. This film is so powerful. It's very well produced but it's power comes from the truth that it portrays. Seeing different passages of the Scriptures is quite riveting. One can only say, \\"Worthy is the Lamb for sinners slain.\\"
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess I understand the initial appeal. Once you get beyond the initial sex acts, however, the weakness of the writing and unbelievability of the characters and story begin to overshadow everything else. I even got to the point where I was rolling my eyes at the sex scenes. And if she called him her poor fifty, or fifty shades, one more time... I would have thrown the book at the wall except I was reading it on my kindle.
0880293667|5.0|There are conflicting stages of revenge and remorse when committing a crime.  In \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, the main character Montresor goes through those stages while committing a murder.  Montresor's hatred toward his friend Fortunato grows to such a degree that he needs to seek revenge to find peace.  During this story line, Poe explains the thought process of second guessing yourself when you are about to do something that you know is morally wrong.  When Montresor is about to complete the mission he has set out on, the remorse he feels is not strong enough to stop him from finishing the task at hand.<br /><br />The hatred one person has for another can build for many years before the person finally snaps.  The cause of the hatred in this story is unclear. What is clear is that there are acts conducted by Fortunato that have caused Montresor to be angry enough to seek revenge.  Montresor states in the beginning, \\"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge\\" (p. 666).  This statement is the key to why he is seeking revenge.  The reason for the degree of revenge is addressed when his anger inside is expressed, \\"I must not only punish, but punish with impunity\\" (p. 666).<br /><br />When faced with a major issue that has a right course of action, and a wrong one, a person can be twisted in many conflicting directions. One may be seeking ways to escape the situation that has developed to a point of no return.  Several times throughout the story Montresor attempts to convince his prey to turn around. In the beginning of his deception, after he has laid the bait of Amontillado, his first attempt to get out of this is to suggest that he can get help from elsewhere.  This is futile since Fortunato sees himself as the best wine taster, and if anyone else was sought out for this task it would be an insult.  The attempts to get Fortunato to turn back continue during the walk through thecrypt. Montresor repeatedly states his worry about his friend's cough, \\"we will go back; your health is precious...we will go back; you will be ill\\" (p. 668).  These attempts to back out continue though the entire journey to Fortunato's final resting place. However, this seems to be a weak attempt on turning back. When they do reach the end, and he is chaining his friend up he asks one last time, as if speaking to himself now, \\"once more let me implore you to return. No?\\" (p. 670).<br /><br />Montresor is finishing his task of building a wall to bury his victim when he starts to feel remorse and sympathy for Fortunato.  The noise his victim makes seems to get inside his head, \\"loud and shrill screams...seemed to thrust me violently back...I trembled\\" (p. 671).  The rest of his work is spent mocking Fortunato's pleas until Fotunato falls silent, and at last he is \\"hearkened for a reply\\" (p. 671).  However, these are weak feelings, and nothing compared to the revenge that is driving him to bury this man alive.<br /><br />The anger that drives Montresor's revenge shows the darkness that humans are capable of doing.  Edger Allen Poe shows that once a person is driven to madness, that they will justify their need to find peace through whatever means they can find it.  This story also shows how one might find justification in what they are doing when they offer up weak attempts for the other to escape their misfortune.

0439023513|1.0|Having read the books I would seriously have to question if Collins was truly the author of this last one.  It is a dark, depressing, drawn-out book.  Very little action, lifeless boring characters, meaningless plot and a rushed ending that leaves you feeling used.<br /><br />By the end of the book I couldn't care less about the characters that I once loved.  More time was spend describing the scenery than giving us the information we needed to follow the plot.  Threads that were so intricately woven in the first two books were simply cut off with no explanation.<br /><br />What in the world happened to the Collins that wrote the first two books?  Where are the characters we fell in love with?  Where is the action?  Excitement?  Not wanting to put the book down feeling?  It's not here.

0312641893|5.0|I was actually planning of waiting to read this until after at least the second novel came out because I was sure it would have a cliffhanger, but when a friend won an ebook copy and sent it to me, I couldn't say no.  I was right though, it does have a cliffhanger.  Don't ask me how bad of a cliffhanger it is because I honestly don't know.  When I was about midway through, I started looking at reviews online and almost all of them said that it had one of the worst cliffhangers they had ever read.  I really didn't think it was that bad.  I don't know if it is because I was preparing for the worst or if I am just (sadly) getting more accustomed to cliffhangers, but I thought the ending could have been way worse.  I guess I could see how people  would think it is so bad, but I didn't think it was nearly as bad as the ending of Nevermore by Kelly Creagor Daughter Of Smoke And Bone by Laini Taylor.  Then again, I didn't think the ending of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was too bad and I had friends who were completely outraged.  All in all, though I am really excited to read the next novel, it isn't one that I am willing to murder my own parents to get my hands on at this very moment.<br /><br />I would summarize, but I really suck at it, so if you want a summary, please refer to other reviews or the book blurb. Thank you for your cooperation. I really loved this book.  I swear, the more dystopian I read, the more I find to love.  The only way I can really describe this book is take the Disney film Cinderella, combine it with the 20th Century Fox film Anastasia and set it in iRobot.  Except the robots are called androids and they don't try to take over the human race.  My only real complaint is that it was a bit predictable.<br /><br />Things I loved:<br />-The fact that it was love triangle free.<br />-I loved the characters.  Cinder, Iko, Kai, and Peony especially.  Cinder was completely believable and even though her actions weren't always the right ones, I could always see where she was coming from. Iko was probably my favorite character.  Come on, how do you not love a sarcastic android?!?! Peony was a sweet girl who doesn't deserve her fate.  And then there was Kai.  He just didn't come off as the typical prince character to me.  He was charming and flirty and sarcastic and incredible resentful of the position he was in.  But he also loved his people deeply and spent a good deal of his time worrying about them and was willing to sacrifice everything for them.  That description sounds like a typical prince, but he just doesn't feel like one to me.<br />-The world.  This is a book I would love to see turned into a film just to see the atmosphere it occurs in.  Maybe it is just me, but I love sinking into a world completely different than my own...maybe that is why I love romance novels so much.  The buildings and the hovercrafts and the androids and geez, I wanna live there!<br /><br />Things I wasn't so fond of:<br />-The cliffhanger.  Even though I didn't think it was too bad, I think cliffhangers in general are bad and shouldn't be allowed in stories.<br />-The predictability of the story.  I didn't see everything coming, but the main plot points, I saw them coming a mile away.<br /><br />This really is an amazing novel.  I am truly blown away by it and I recommend it to everyone.  Great story, amazing writing, good characters.  It really has it all.d always see where she was coming from. Iko was probably my favorite character.  Come on, how do you not love a sarcastic android?!?! Peony was a sweet girl who doesn't deserve her fate.  And then there was Kai.  He just didn't come off as the typical prince character to me.

But he also loved his people deeply and spent a good deal of his time worrying about them and was willing to sacrifice everything for them.  That description sounds like a typical prince, but he just doesn't feel like one to me.<br />-The world.  This is a book I would love to see turned into a film just to see the atmosphere it occurs in.  Maybe it is just me, but I love sinking into a world completely different than my own...maybe that is why I love romance novels so much.  The buildings and the hovercrafts and the androids and geez, I wanna live there!<br /><br />Things I wasn't so fond of:<br />-The cliffhanger.  Even though I didn't think it was too bad, I think cliffhangers in general are bad and shouldn't be allowed in stories.<br />-The predictability of the story.  I didn't see everything coming, but the main plot points, I saw them coming a mile away.<br /><br />This really is an amazing novel.  I am truly blown away by it and I recommend it to everyone.  Great story, amazing writing, good characters.  It really has it all.
B005EXA8LY|3.0|Well... I like Porcupine Tree very much. I bought thinking it was similar (Steven Wilson is the main Porcupine guy). My mistake, only mine. The bluray has no videos and the songs are very different from those I like.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|when shopping for camera equipment i only look at the best original products. I have purchased a Canon battery grip from amazon and with 7 days i recieved it. I am 100% happy with my product. It was an amazing buy. Quick and easy quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the whole series and this one was the best. My grandchildren turned me on to this series and I loved them all.  It gave us something common to discuss with enthusiasm.
B006JTS5OO|3.0|If you were one of the unfortunate ones that saw The Muppets Wizard of Oz a few years ago, I don't think I need to explain why I went into this movie with very, very low expectations. Face it- the Muppets haven't done much since the early 90s, and to me, the last decent thing they had was The Muppet Christmas Carol. When I was younger, I'd always rent VHS tapes of The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies was one of the regular shows I'd watch on tv, but I can't say I was really a huge fan of them. All the bland movies over the last 10 years didn't help my stance on the matter. Sure, there were a couple of sketches and characters I liked a lot, but that was about it. When The Muppets hit theaters just a few months ago, there were seemingly no bad reviews- just tons of praise from viewers who had nothing but fond memories of the Muppets from their childhood. Honestly, it seemed like they made this movie seem better than it actually was, not letting go of the nostalgia. But I knew that this movie would be even slightly better than Muppets Wizard of Oz if only because of Jason Segel, someone who genuinely cares about puppetry.<br /><br />The Muppets' plot is simple Muppet-ish stuff: Gary is a human and his brother, Walter, is a Muppet (don't ask). They're close, always do things together, and both of them are huge fans of The Muppet Show. When the two go with Gary's girlfriend, Mary, on a little vacation, they take a trip to the original Muppet Studios- a dream come true! But when they get there, everything is in shambles. Buildings are dusty and devoid of life, and it turns out that a rich Texan oil man, Tex Richman, has bought the land that the studio is on, and plans to destroy everything to make way for oil drilling. Unless ten million dollars is raised within a few days to negate the contract, the studio is toast. So Walter and Gary find Kermit and convince him to get the gang back together and put on a show to save everything. Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Piggy, the Electric Mayhem Band, even secondary Muppets like Crazy Harry, Lips and Lew Zealand join the gang once more for what could be their last hurrah. Unfortunately, Gary's so distracted by this Muppet business that he forgets all about spending time with Mary, despite being a full-grown adult, and seems more concerned with Walter fitting in with the Muppet gang than anything. How will the relationship go with their 10th anniversary coming up?<br /><br />Yeah, it's nothing new, but it sure could've been worse (seriously, go watch The Muppets Wizard of Oz if you don't believe me). Something that worried me was that a lot of time would've been spent with Gary and Mary instead of the focus being on the Muppets, but that wasn't quite the case. Time is split between the two plots very well, with Kermit and the gang getting a good 75% of the screen time. The movie moves at a fast pace, and it was fun seeing them recruit everyone. Gonzo being a big time plumbing supply business man was nice, Fozie having a wanna-be group of Muppets to go on stage with was a good joke, and what happened to Animal is so good that I won't ruin the gag here. Really, there isn't any kind of big problem I have with the movie other than they played it too safe, and that jokes were a lot tamer than some of what was on The Muppet Show and a few of the better movies. There were a few times where I laughed a little bit, namely the Animal bit, what Rowlf was doing when they recruited him, a kidnapping bit that just plain looked funny in how a certain character moved, and a few minor sight gags. The Muppets is easily accessible to people of all ages. My daughter is 5 years old, and she LOVES this movie, already having the songs memorized, and cracks up during the 'Muppet Or A Man' bit.<br /><br />Even though I say there's no big problem I have with the movie, it's still pretty plain. Walter is as generic as you can get, and his big talent that comes into play towards the end is so lame that I thought it was a joke, andthat his real talent was going to be revealed after what he did. I also can't stand the new voice actor for Rowlf. Yes, I get that he was silent for so many years after Jim Henson's death out of respect, and I appreciate that, but this guy sounds nothing like Rowlf. He was better off staying silent in all honesty. Some of the Muppet movements are off too, and this isn't coming from some hardcore Muppet fanatic. Kermit's signature arm shaking isn't as crazy as it should be, and there were a lot of times where certain Muppets' mouth movements were off. These are just little nitpicks, and won't apply to most people, but it distracted me from enjoying the movie. Oh well, at least Uncle Deadly, one of my favorites, finally got some good screen time! And for those worried about the use of CG in the movie, don't worry- it's used sparingly, and was mostly used to eliminate wires/rods on the Muppets' arms, but is also used for a couple of scenes.<br /><br />Something I never liked about the old Muppet movies was how dark and faded everything looked. It always put me down to see such a lively cast of characters like that. Well, that problem is long gone on the blu-ray. Colors pop out at you, are lush and will really make use of your tv. Leave it to Disney to make sure the picture quality is top notch on home releases. You can see every tiny detail on the Muppets if you look hard enough. The audio quality gets equally good treatment with a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. Yes, it's more than the movie needs, since there aren't giant robots flying around blowing things up, so what? It helps the musical numbers more than anything else.<br /><br />As far as the special features go, this combo pack got a good amount of extras, though it's not as much as you might expect for the first major Muppet movie in years. First up is a commentary track with Jason Segel, executive producer/co-writer Nicholas Stoller, and director James Bobin. The guys give out tons of fun facts and information about how the film came to be, and it's always good to hear from Segel, who really knows his stuff when it comes to puppetry and the Muppets. He's been good on commentary tracks before, and he continues to be fun to listen to here. There's an 8 minute 'The Longest Blooper Reel Ever. At Least In Muppet History...We Think', and I'll just let the name of this feature speak for itself. It's amusing, but goes on longer than it should. Also on here are 13 minutes of deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is a little unsettling compared to what they went with for the final cut. Finally are a quick faux script reading, a short featurette about the making of the movie (way better than any 'making of' I've seen over the last couple of years), and some spoof trailers, which to me were the best thing on here. And it's worth noting that every time you pause the movie, you get one of many different intermission sequences with Statler and Waldorf, live action sequences or previews of other extras. It's quality over quantity here. And if you go with the 3 disc package, there's also a code to download the soundtrack, but you have to get it through the Disney Movie Rewards site, where you get to download a Zip file after entering the code. It's annoying, but hey, you still get the soundtrack for free.<br /><br />I watched the movie just a few hours ago, and when it was over, I went on with the rest of my night, not thinking much about it. There wasn't a lasting impression that was left on me, but again, it's still a heck of a lot better than say...Muppets Wizard of Oz. To me, the movie could've been better if they ditched the Walter and Gary characters and made it be 100% about the Muppets. Amy Adams was more or less wasted, apart from showing off her singing talents a few times, and the slew of celebrity guests are mostly in blink-and-you-miss-them roles. Still, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half of your time, and no matter what I say, hardcore Muppet fans willadore his no matter what. If you're a casual fan, it's worth a rental.
1594484805|5.0|Drive is an entertaining and light read, but it also has and interesting and provocative subject matter.  In this way it is much like a Malcolm Gladwell book (who actually gave the book an endorsement).  The subject matter is both interesting because it deals with motivation and provocative because the world at large, for the most part, is unfortunately still operating under the idea of BF Skinner's behaviorism (carrots and sticks), whereas the truth of intrinsic motivation is sadly unknown.  The upshot is that carrots and sticks do work very well -- which is why everyone uses them constantly -- but for only a very narrow band of circumstances.  This second part of behaviorism is what most people are unaware of as is the power of intrinsic motivation, which takes over where carrots and sticks falls short.  This topic is so important because even though this is thoroughly researched in social science it is largely ignored by today's policy makers and leaders of businesses and places of education.<br /><br />Daniel Pink's TED Talk on this subject is a primer to this conversation and well worth seeing.  However, if you want the entire story about intrinsic motivation -- which deals with autonomy, mastery and purpose -- the book elucidates. I disagree with other reviews who rate the book low, unless you are an academic, researcher or someone who is familiar with the field and want an in-depth understanding, then yes, maybe look elsewhere for another book.  However, if you are a layperson and someone new to the conversation and want a light or quick read, then this may be the perfect book to start with.  The book is primarily 150 pages with another 100 pages of a \\"toolkit\\" which includes features such as a recap, a glossary, a reading list and a conversation starter.  The reading list is a wonderful way to further explore the topic of motivation and an indication of who the book was really intended for; the mainstream audience with only a cursory understanding on the topic of motivation.ic of motivation.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|I picked this up on a whim and because I always like reading Denise's blog.  I have to say it is one of the better books I've read so far this year.<br /><br />I was suppose to be finishing up some work today before our Easter celebration - but couldn't put it down!  I so wanted to know what would happen to Rose next ... who was this Joe who wouldn't get involved but was always there?<br /><br />When I got to the end I was sad - it couldn't be over ... but unfortunately it was.  Now I have to try to wait until June when 29 and 1/2 Reasons arrives - no it won't be easy.  But I will try and have patience .... not easy for me.<br /><br />Check this one out and then wait with me for the next installment of Rose's story.  I don't think you will be disappointed.  Great job Denise - you did yourself proud!

B006H5120E|5.0|All hats off to Mr. Cameron. Like all directors have, this is his masterpiece, and the 3D restoration is indeed worth another go round. For a new generation, this will be the first time they see it on the BIG screen, and they will be in awe. This is not what I call \\"exploitation\\" 3D. This is natural depth 3D, and it will make you feel like you are aboard the ship. Some scenes more impressive than others in the new format, but overall, the film was as effective, if not more so, than the 1997 showing. I cannot wait for the Blu-ray 3D release. I hope Mr. Cameron doesn't make us first buy the 2D Blu-ray like he did with AVATAR.<br /><br />UPDATE, UPDATE !!!<br /><br />The Blu-ray 3D is in, and WOW!!. On my projected screen size, about 10 feet wide, this movie is just amazing. To those seeing it in 3D for the first time, they cannot believe this movie was originally shot in 2D. This is total 3D perfection!. Just as good as AVATAR in 3D (taking into consideration that computer generated images usually make the best 3D movies). For those whose home theaters have 1.85:1 displays or screens, the 3D image will fill their screens completely, because Mr. Cameron decided to keep the IMAX ratio. The 2D version has stunning quality (Bit rates as high as 48 bps) and preserved the original PANAVISION theatrical ratio of 2.39:1, which does crop information from the top and the bottom, which we never knew existed. For those of us with Panavision ratio projection screens, the choice will be not to fill the sides of our screens, or to \\"crop\\" the 1.85 ratio like was done for the 2D version. I am projecting an image which is about 2.20:1, and I am not cropping any significant information, and the image is wider, which I personally prefer. This is a MUST have movie, especially now in Blu-ray 2D and 3D.

B007BLCJJ6|1.0|Whomever wrote the summary for this movie should be barred from the writer's guild... Psychological thriller?  If you want to be bored out of your mind for two hours.  Stunning debut?  Elizabeth Olson spends majority of the movie showing skin and facing the camera with a vacant stare. The only reason I watched the entire movie was to see if the action ever picked up (it did not).<br /><br />-Musical score is excessively overdone<br />-Ending is absolutely terrible... Worst I have seen in a while.<br />-Terrible script.
B0018RDP7O|4.0|I held off listening to this album because Iron Maiden's newer material has been so boring. Brave New World was just OK and Dance of Death was unbearable. But this one is much better. I like the fact that they added progressive elements and extended out the songs. Bruce sounds just as good as ever. As all Iron Maiden albums go, the songs suffer a little from the repetition of lyrics. The instrumentals help balance that out though. There also seems to be weird production. I can see how people would say the instruments sound a little flat. It doesn't bother me as much. Overall this is a good album.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|I previously had tried a couple of different free pdf readers, one of them being the Adobe one. The Foxit reader runs better on both my Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus and my Galaxy Player 5.0. Not quite as fast as on my Windows 7 dual-core netbook, but pretty good for these devices. Worth paying for given how much better it runs compared to the Adobe reader.

B005FITIK0|4.0|I applaud Charlize Theron for taking on this role of a reprehensible writer, trying to relive her high school glory days. It's not often we see a film with such an unlikeable character and as the film goes on she doesn't change and become more likeable. An amazing, gutsy performance. Sometimes funny, often infuriating, this is a film that's obviously polarized people into those who like it and those who loathe it. Bravo for Diablo Cody for bringing us this offbeat story. It's not for everyone, but if you like the offbeat and some great acting - Patton Oswalt rocks - give this a look.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how I can sync it from all of my devices. easy to use. interface is very User friendly. Check it out.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I marveled at the ever-so-long 5-star analyses/critique/comparisons of this current version to 6 hours of Guinness. Not much of this is easy on the eyes or the brain. Oldman's robot-like performance, the garbled mumble of most of the British, Hungarian, Russian, etc articulation, plus the dreary venues/cinematography brought this equation to mind- slooow + confusing = boring. A huge yawn for me and for anyone wanting this thing to get off the ground, I wanted to be entertained, not burdened by a bunch of unremarkable talking heads being 'intellectual spies'. But then you have to be a major Le Carré fan to find this even interesting, much less entertaining. I returned the rental after 45 min. into the film.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! its so cute. I wasn't to thrilled Cuz I thought it was a rip off of Mario but it super fun!! Its hard to find good free games but this is great!

B002EEP3NO|5.0|Hey guys deal hunter here reviewing the lego death star! This set is by far the best ever set lego has ever made! Before i review i want to let you people want to know when this set will discontinue. This set has been out for four years and lego has stoped making them in January 1st 2012.once i heard that i new i just had to get one before it disapeared forever! this set is excellent for kids! so many many features,so many posssibilities! If i had bought this set years ago i would have played forever with it! this set is alsos a fans best friend,so many scenes from the star wars trilogy have been added in this set. So if your a big fan of lego and star wars classic (BUY THIS NOW!) $400 now is cheap to what its gonna cost in the future.If your considering consider no longer buy it now before it costs $1,000 - $2,000

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Are we as a society so desperate to create luster and popularity out of another trilogy, just to say we have done so?  This book is terrible.  Third rate story-telling, horrible descriptions or lack of I should say, and there is absolutely no depth.  I am not understanding the big deal with this book at all, but I guess every year needs a new \\"boy band\\" to replace the one ones that become men, and this series is trying to replace, Harry Potter, Twilight, and The Hunger Games.  Horrible choice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it works great for me, haven't seen the issues that others have posted but I also just got it but I like it
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I usually like independent films so I took a chance on buying the DVD and I'm glad I did.  I liked the story, acting and filming of this movie completely.

0525478817|5.0|I've been a fan of John Green's since Looking for Alaska. I also enjoyed Paper Towns, but still have never gotten around to An Abundance of Katherines, and probably never will. Sometimes there are just books that don't appeal to me, and that's one of them. But I LOVE John Green's work, and had eagerly anticipated The Fault in Our Stars. I knew John had a new book coming out, but I had refused to read any summaries, reviews, etc, because I simply wanted to go into the book without any preconceptions.    Ironically, last month, a finally brought myself to read My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult. Let's just say that I've now had my fill of 'cancer' books. At this point I should mention that I also loved Jordan Sonnenblick's Drums, Girls & Dangerous Pie. This is a must read, IMHO.    John Green did not disappoint. I rated this book 5 out of 5 stars, though I will say that as a made my way through the first half of the book, I wasn't sure if that would be the case. I often found myself having to reread sentences and passages. I can often read a book, skipping sentences here and there, because I know what the author is going to write next. I can't do that with John's books....but I'm glad! Reading this book made me feel smart!! Reading this book made me want to be smarter and wittier than Hazel and Augustus. I wanted to connect with them on their level, but I realized, that that level of intellect and wit belonged to them. They owned that, they needed that, and I was just lucky enough to be reading their story. Thank you, John Green, for that.    What I feel now, after finishing, is that Augustus needed Hazel, and Hazel needed Augustus, and the world needs to know that there is someone out there for everyone. This book is an emotional roller coaster, but that's okay, because what Hazel and Augustus have to say about life, leaving it behind, and the world that we belong in, will make us all evaluate who we are and what we will one day leave behind as our legacy.    Other thoughts I had on the book, and I would love to hear from other's who've finished it:    Hazel needed to know what happened to Anna, her mom, the Dutch Tulip Man, and Sisyphus the Hamster...John Green - I need to know what happened to Hazel, her mom, and Peter Van Houten the Author  I REALLY thought that when Hazel knew that her mother would have a life after her death, that her time to let go had come......but this goes back to the first bullet point    I don't often reread a book, but I think at some point, I will reread this one. Why 5 out of 5 stars?.....I will buy this book for my library, I will probably reread this book, I will recommend this book, and I will refer to this book often. I didn't cry at the end of the book because I was not alone when I finished it. If I had been alone when finishing it, I would have bawled my eyes out....no doubt.    I recommend this book for Grades 9 and up. There is mild language. There is sexual content, though not explicit.    \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you.

B007P3TMW2|1.0|This movie was overly casted by quality talents and a low quality script and storyline.  The storyline doesn't follow a logical sequence of events.  First, the movie started with a funeral.  Then supposed dead father had a meal at the diner with his son, then he's back being dead again. The Hollywood mainstream label these films \\"revisiting the dead\\" or flashbacks.  You can get whiplash with all the flashbacks in this film.  The father came alive to relive life within the family again.  Then, he died again in the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center.  The boy was superb in holding the film together with his narrative while the mother played by Sandra Bullock held a passive position...As a matter of fact - I can't remember seeing a role where Sandra was this passive.  I don't want to give away the film in case anyone wishes to see it - but the film wasn't worth the $12.00 movie price. And it certainly not worth the $3.00 rental price.  For those curious about this film - try to see if you can get it out of Redbox for a $1.  Then you wont feel shortchanged.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I got these because I heard they were really good head phones so I did my reserch and some people rated it really good some didn't .well I say the quality is very good sound us amazing but the life of the batterys suck. Other than that its great I love them.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire has to be one of the best books I've read for some time.  Just when you thought it couldn't get more interesting Suzanne Collins just adds another twist into the story.  EXCELLENT read, would recommend it to anyone looking for a good story.  You won't regret it.
B007JRU2UK|1.0|I am quite surprised by the number of good reviews for this.  While perhaps much of the acting is reflective of a family dealing with a real life issue - it seemed like the writing was a tad overboard on the \\"raw\\" quality of it.  At the end, I felt like the movie accomplished little and I was sad that I had wasted the 2 hours.  If you are looking for a theme of redemption where the initial character development comes full circle, this is not the movie for you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved it because if I die and I have a check point I go back and get what ever I need
0812550706|4.0|I read this book because the movie is coming out next year.  Great sci-fi novel and a quick read.  Definitely recommended if you're looking for an exciting science fiction story.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|After reading the book, there is a bit of disappointment watching the film since so many of the characters are either omitted or not developed.  It should have been a mini-series.  However, the movie does capture much of the book's main theme -- individualism versus the collective.  I also found that it gets better after the several viewings and I found myself catching more of the small details.  Overall, a good flick that should appeal to most Rand fans.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was very engaging and the story different from the norm. My first thought was that the relationship between the characters is just really hot. But it's also pure fantasy, as neither character is realistic nor fully inhabits the real world. The sex is always so mind-blowing, so earth-shattering etc. etc., even during Anastasia's first time, even during her menstrual period - with discomfort never really becoming a factor. From a woman's perspective especially, that's just not realistic. But suspending all disbelief and taking it for what it is - the \\"bad romance\\" is hot. The characters themselves are very 2D, the dialogue repetitive and sophomoric - though often funny nevertheless. The BDSM seemed way watered down to me, as despite all the rules and Christian's supposed lust for inflicting pain, Anastasia is barely hurt beyond a passing soreness, and Christian is more eager to comfort and console her at every turn. He throws all his requirements for a Dom-Sub relationship out the door far too easily in my opinion. Having no experience at these things I expected the BDSM to be more hardcore. But overall this is a fascinating story, especially for someone unused to this kind of sexual exploration. It does leave you wanting to know more, and wondering how the relationship between the two characters will ultimately turn out.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I had been wanting to see this movie and I enjoyed it a lot on Amazon.  I HAD HELP FROM A REP OF AMAZON WHO HELPED ME GET THE MOVIE ON MY COMPUTER. A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME!!!
0470449764|5.0|There are a lot of books out there trying to sell their special methods for the GMAT - often written by the very schools (Princeton Review, Kaplan etc.) that are trying to sell you their $3000 prep class. The truth is you don't need those because 1) they don't feature actual questions from the GMAT 2) the purported \\"special strategies\\" are nothing special at all, often just a re-writing of the strategies already spelled out in the official GMAC preparation material 3) they are often written in a completely dumbed-down language (which most people will find highly irritable).<br /><br />In short, the official GMAC practice book has all your need to prepare for the GMAT and will suffice for the vast majority of candidates. It has a great review section explained in straight language, and a long list of actual questions from the GMAT exam. Buy this one (and the verbal version). Don't waste money and time on the other books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great app!  fun and addictive with plenty to do so you don't get board.  keep up the good work gameloft
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is lots of fun. kind of like Mario. not as good as Mario but pretty darn close. try it.
0446541478|2.0|While this book provides some interesting and valid insight into Israel's entrepreneurial landscape, it is riddled throughout with misleading statistics and biased opinions on almost everything that is Israeli.<br />I do not recommend this book to anyone in search of an objective overview of Israeli's economy
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Michael Haller's law business is running on low, and he is handling house repossession cases, arising as a result of the financial meltdown. Therefore, he is sort of surprised, or maybe not, when one of his clients, Lisa Trammel, a \\"nuisance client\\" in Haller's words, is arrested and charged with the murder of Mitchell Bondurant. Bondurant was a senior vice president at the bank that was foreclosing on Lisa Trammel's house. To spice things up further, Lisa had been issued a restraining order (a temporary restraining order, to be precise) by a judge and ordered not to come near the WestLand Bank. Therefore, Lisa was a person who had the motive, and perhaps the opportunity too. To defend Lisa, Haller needs to find a strawman, an alternative theory, and introduce probable cause and sufficient doubt in the jury's minds to acquit Trammel of the charge. Facing him, as the public prosecutor, is Andrea Freeman, a shartp, smart, and no-nonsense person who plays to win. There is a shady Hollywood hustler, Dahl, who is trying to secure a lucrative deal for himself and Lisa for the movie rights to this story, something that Haller is also trying to sew up, more to get himself paid since Lisa is more or less financially incapable of paying Haller. There is a serious assault on Haller by unknown thugs that lands him in hospital with broken bones. In a nod to the prevalence and increasing ubiquity of social networking, there is somewhat crucial role that Facebook, the social networking site, plays. And there is a reference to Matthew McConaughey - who, incidentally, or not, played the role of Mickey Haller in the successful movie, \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\"!<br /><br />Running along a parallel track is Haller's somewhat complicated relationship with his first ex-wife Maggie \\"McFierce\\", yes - there are two ex-wives, and their daughter Haley.<br /><br />The book ends with a slight twist in the tale, as has been the case with the author's two earlier Mickey Haller novels, and then there's a new, and major twist to the tale that should make the next installment of the franchise interesting.<br /><br />This is Michael Connelly, the author's, third book that I read, and all three have been Mickey Haller books. Of the three, this is probably the weakest, in my (humble) opinion. There is a considerable amount of space devoted to the trial itself, in the courtroom, and to the frequent interruptions, objections, motions, and sparring between all three characters - Haller, Freeman, and judge Perry. While the basic plot and narration holds your attention, it somehow feels less than satisfying, compared to the earlier two novels. It still rates an entertaining thriller, but suffers somewhat in comparison.a new, and major twist to the tale that should make the next installment of the franchise interesting.<br /><br />This is Michael Connelly, the author's, third book that I read, and all three have been Mickey Haller books.

B005HEUF0Y|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best episodes, if not THE best. The story and acting are excellent and capable of producing tears towards the end.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The bonus features on this 'Skynet Edition' are great, including two alternate endings. Video and sound quality are excellent. A must-have for a growing Blu-Ray collection!
0007444397|4.0|The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved it, I can not wait for the movie, which I know can never be as good as this book was
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I didn't get this game yet but I read the comments that its cool but only 2 worlds. So just saying. BYE EVERYONE!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have to say this first; the 4th film was not bad at ALL!!! If you're a REAL fan, then you know the last Indy is just as good as the first 3. I just wish i knew when this Blu-Ray set was getting released because they have yet to give it one! Come on! If the distributor was smart, they'd know that they would make a ton of money off this because Indiana Jones is one of the best adventure sagas of all time, right behind The Lord of the Rings but ahead of Pirates of the Caribbean & The Mummy. Please, release this already!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|works with kindle fire but has lots of ads when online has fun mini games to kill time but u have to accumulate points to unlock them<br />p.s. I get 250k for this review lol
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Just finished Hounded by Kevin Hearne. Great read! It's creative, inventive, funny and written like every fantasy adventure should be written. From page one it kept me on the edge wanting more with side bits of humor thrown in. Hearne's characters were amazing and unique, truly an out of the box fantasy experience!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game has a lot of very simple similarities to Mario-but still fun! Simple controls. definitely worth a download. My kids enough it too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game it has many mini games good graphics good goals and the insure was the energy but that's to be expected
B003DBOS7Y|3.0|If It makes your wife happy on date night how bad can it be?  The Notebook is a formulaic love story sure to please your S.O.  I even found myself (Shhhh) liking it quite a bit.<br /><br />The screenplay and direction is better than most Romances. Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling are both very good in the film which manages to keep it's pacing even during slow periods.<br /><br />This one is worth a rental on Amazon Instant Videos or pick up the Blu ray if it's on sale for $9.99.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|open world nice gameplay and I love it the western theme is awesome. and its free you cant beat that
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It starts a little slow and Richard Gere is once again paired with a woman half his age, but despite that it is a wonderful story of love, loyalty, and true devotion. Only a hard-case won't tear up watching this movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app! It is so fun, but it is a rip off of Nintendo 's<br />Mario Bros. You should get it. I totally recommend.
0345803485|1.0|This is such trash.  It is poorly written and the story is just smut.  When there are so many beautifully written novels available (Possession) and such mind blowing true stories (Unbroken) awaiting you in nonfiction, please don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
0812992792|4.0|The Orphan Master's Son: A Novel by Adam Johnson does what excellent fiction can do to illustrate the human condition. It takes an exotic setting, universalizes it, and makes us care. North Korea is a challenging place for fiction, but an artist's imagination (I don't use this lightly) can make a story seen in headlines fresh. Johnson's well-researched, fast-paced novel follows a boy raised in the industrial city of Chongjin, affected by the famine of the 1990s and sent to serve in the army to escape famine. The second half introduces other narratives, all of whom, woven together, show how the human spirit is warped by the bonds of totalitarianism.<br />There is pathos along with horror, and even lighter moments as well, making the book extremely readable.
0385344228|4.0|This is a page turner for sure.  You are swept in from page one.  The author has you guessing, questioning, thinking throughout the book.  It is very thought provoking if you are a parent.  What would you do if your child was accused?  Would you ever let any doubt in?  Great read!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|!lgreat game..I would recommend it to everyone..just reminds me of mario<br />..I Gog it for my son and played it mysself
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This movie may seem to just be a weird premise for a movie, but as long as you are even a casual fan of horror movies, it's an absolute must-see
B001H1SVO8|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should rent this movie but I'm so glad I did. One of the best movies I have ever seen.
B005I64U5C|4.0|Some people who hate on this film obviously couldn't suspend their disbelief long enough to enjoy it.  It's not the greatest DC hero, but the outer space sequences were really cool, especially in 3D, and Ryan Reynolds' suit effects were cool to see glimmer as he stood with the Core.  The final battle may have been weak, but I'm sure they were hoping to set up sequels with larger battles ala Star Wars or other space opera.  Hopefully they won't give up on this franchise, it would be a great way to see other cosmic DC heroes show up in later sequels.
0765365278|4.0|Written in modern prose, it's sometimes hard to obtain suspension of disbelief, but the storyline is captivating and moves fast so it's hard to put down.  Very unlike other fantasy books I've read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|several games with a great catch to be just yourself and have a good time. I can't belive the amount of time i've put into this game.
B004UID2LC|5.0|great app for viewing and downloading youtube apps. much better than dealing with youtybe. and I seem to get much higher download sppeeds through this app.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|i think this game is really good its just that it is basically mario.there is nothing wrong with this game its really fun...i just think its a copy of mario.
