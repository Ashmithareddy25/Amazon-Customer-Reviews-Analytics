B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good writing.  Drama, of course---but well done.  It took me a couple of episodes, back in Season 1, to identify with the characters since their world is pretty foreign to me.  But now that I do, I find them interesting and not cardboard-y at all.  I highly recommend this show.

BRILLIANT<br /><br />And if not Cher - Cher gave it power.<br /><br />Love all the songs.  My fav is Bang Bang - but I can never find the version I liked best .... oh well.<br /><br />The songs on this album are powerful and rhythmic - if she were male, Cher could have been a legendary Indian Brave.<br /><br />Empowering - Can't say enough good about this collection .....
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this nutty little app has been like my best buddy day in and day out. Very easy to program and you can use your favorite songs as your alarm.
B00C5R8364|5.0|For one reason or another I have not read many of the author's recent works - my loss for sure. Truly amazing piece - the complexities riding the crest of anticipation assert themselves with a simplicity belying the enormity of the task as well as their implications. To stay attuned to the many moving parts and not getting lost is marvelously artful. Will be attending more to his writings, thanks to Mr. Forsyth.

B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|I'm not used to writing reviews here on Amazon, but I had to write a note about this CD. It was my first encounter with Gregory Porter... and it was a very good one!! I'm so happy I found you, Gregory. I've already listened to this CD many times. The lyrics are so honest, beautiful and mature. Very touching. I'd sure recommend this album to anyone with a decent taste for music. Thank you, Gregory!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the absolute best picross game on the market.  Th e only problem is that it sometimes slows down to a crawl but that's only in the menu
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. I haven't put it down since I got it. I only wish there were more pix to uncover. I finished the game now what? Need an update with more puzzles.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Stellar musicians.... Have been a fan since 1989... I'm a musician myself....blah blah blah... ok, now that that's out of the way.... :)<br /><br />Everyone is mentioning the bad mix/production.  Agreed.<br />Everyone is saying they have gone downhill.  Agreed.<br />Everyone is saying LaBrie is emotionless and boring now.  Agreed.<br />Everyone is saying the playing is still amazing.  Agreed.<br />Everyone is saying the songwriting has suffered.  Agreed.<br /><br />HOWEVER... there is something everyone seems to be missing.  It's simple really... Portnoy was right.  DT needed a MAJOR break.  But what I would like to add is that they needed a break from ALL music.<br /><br />To explain... Everyone knows the members of DT play in like a zillion different side projects.  So it begs the question... How can DT write masterpieces like I&W, Awake, and Scenes when they are now (and have been) distilling their musical ideas through a zillion side projects?  If you are writing with 'this band, and that band, and this project, and that project' then how much QUALITY can you bring to the DT table when you return?  How can you possibly bring emotion to the DT table when you are putting more emotion into the side projects that are now becoming abundantly clear that the DT members actually prefer?  Especially 'solo' albums.  Everyone knows when a musician makes a 'solo' album, they put everything they have into it!  So how can you put everything you have into that 'solo' album and then still have juice in the tank for YOUR BAND?!?!<br /><br />Sadly, DT seems to exist now basically to satisfy the DT members' ability to use it as a platform (for publicity and financially) for OTHER projects... and this is the great tragedy.<br /><br />So yes, Mike Portnoy was right... DT needed a break.  I just wish they would take a TOTAL break, quit all the side projects, and return in 2-3 years with a MONSTER album that would make everyone proud again.  People say \\"stop comparing it with [insert album title here].\\"  But how can we not??  When you set a precedent, when you still had enough in the tank to contribute to a FEW side projects while still making killer music as DT, then of course we are going to compare the more recent work with the prior work.  But now that you are 25 years along, you need to re-focus and channel the ideas in one direction because the ideas don't come quite so easily anymore.<br /><br />Before anyone bashes... as a musician, I KNOW we need to play in different situations to stay sharp, alive, etc.... I totally get that.  But the reality is that these guys are Dream Theater.  The side/solo projects are just left over crumbs.  Give us the monster album, THEN go back to all the other musical desires.<br /><br />QUIT THE SIDE PROJECTS AND PUT ALL YOUR TIME, ENERGY and MUSIC(!!!!) INTO DREAM THEATER AGAIN!!!<br /><br />So how about it DT boys??  Up for the challenge?album title here].\\"  But how can we not??

B007ZXK08C|3.0|Two-hundred pages in, this book had me on the edge of my seat, I couldn't put it down. Such inventive twists, such psychological cleverness.<br />But then half way through, it became too much: too many details, too many detours, too much repetition.<br />And then the ending just petered out. A real disappointment.<br />With a final surprising twist ending, it could have been the best book of the decade. So sorry it wasn't.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was about 60% in before I couldn't put it down. It did take a little while for me to get totally sucked in but it the last half was totally worth it! I thoroughly enjoyed this book!

B0092S4WLY|1.0|More tedious than hard, Constantly having to go back and forth between rooms and remembering stuff can be a pain. That being said, Only 9 floors and it took me about 20 minutes to get through the first 8. Very dumb to put out an app that has only 9 floors with the promise of more, It's been out for a month already and we are still waiting for more. Very disappointing and poorly done. The creators should not have released this app unless they had a good 25-30 floors to start with.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I looked at this for about a week before I finally decided to give it a try. I'm not much for sequels, and The Shining is one of my all time favorites , as I started to read I knew I had made the right choice. Thank you again for such imaginative trip!! It feels like I have been back and forth across the country a few times and got to bump into a few good friends.. Charlie Manx , Abby Freemantle, and a host of others. I wonder what Stu is up to? Great book, thank you for the read, they don't come around very often anymore.
B002VWNID6|3.0|Not rating the movie, rating the quality of the product.<br />I give this product 3 stars only because it was cheap but that still does not excuse the fact that you have to eject the movie half way through to continue to watch it!

B00EZZ9W3C|5.0|I was introduced to this young man last month, after 3 bars, I booked a ticket to see him \\"live\\" at the Ferst Center At Ga. Tech. What a phenomenal artist. He took me to church with \\"Liquid Spirit\\", jumping and patting. He made me cry with \\"No Love Dying Here\\" and \\"Be Good\\"! The musicians were nothing short of miraculous, all of them touched by God. As an vocal artist myself, you have to know the spirit to recognize the spirit...he is truly connected to the Master! His original flow left me hungering for more with each song! I wanted to wrap him up and take him home, he reminded me of my \\"hommies\\" that love to jam, just using our natural talent to glorify God. I ran to Amazon to order my copies of his last two CD's. So grateful to have something to listen to that I don't have to pick and choose the songs...I just plug it in and play!<br />Thank you Gregory, I listened to your testimony and you inspired me to continue to be original in a synthetic world of music. Pure vocal and instrumental talent, so rare, but SO FINE! Keep blessing us with your originality. You will go down in history with the likes of Nat King Cole and the rest. I turned my teenagers on to real jazz. You moved my daughters, they said you would have been my husband in another life:) Your wife and family should treasure every moment God grants you in this life. You are a precious gift from on high!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I found this game fairly challenging and fun. the puzzles did not make much sense, but overall it was good.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Sarah continues to grow as a writer, vocalist and instrumentalist.. but that's not all. She has embraced an expanded range of musical styles within her original compositions and arrangements. She blends her bluegrass and folk music foundation into original ballads that have a sort of playful, sometimes bluesy sound.  Sarah is very innovative, and continues to explore diverse influences in a way that defies categorization. She preserves the bluegrass sound and mood when she wants to, yet is not restricted to stay within its narrow confines.  \\"Over the Edge\\" has more of a country rock sound than anything she has recorded before, yet she somehow keeps it tamed with acoustic instruments & her distinctive melodic vocals.  Other compositions like \\"Build Me Up From Bones\\", \\"Mile on the Moon\\" and \\"1,000 Things\\" are tear-jerkingly beautiful, both vocally and instrumentally.  And there are some wonderful surprises, like in the quirky lyrics of \\"The Book of Right-On\\", which has some interesting and complex instrumental passages too.. a minimalist version of Dylan's \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" with only cello accompaniment to go with her expressive singing.. the joyfully upbeat banjo sound and earnest vocals in \\"Fuel the Fire\\" .. the rest are growing on me too.. this CD doesn't have a single weak song on it!<br />Sarah's alto voice is soothing, warm and sweet.. very smooth, never forced in volume or vibrato.  She's learned to control her wonderful voice and not to blare out too loudly.. many experienced singers twice or thrice her age haven't learned that yet. Her vocal lines are never over-arranged or masked by too many special effects.  The melodies are beautiful and original, and she has blended her lead vocals with a variety of harmonizing backing vocalists.. Aoife O'Donovan, Kate Rusby, Darrell Scott, and Jedd Hughes, and she co-wrote songs with the later two. An impressive choice of guest instrumentalists make solid contributions as well, but I especially like the way Sarah featured her touring trio band mates, Alex Hargreaves on the violin & Nathaniel Smith on the cello.. they are terrific young musicians in their own right, and on the same climbing trajectory as their band leader.atured her touring trio band mates, Alex Hargreaves on the violin & Nathaniel Smith on the cello.. they are terrific young musicians in their own right, and on the same climbing trajectory as their band leader.

B00F91SCXC|3.0|Ok, I know you really have to suspend logic and reality to like zombie movies (and I DO like zombie movies), but does it bug anyone else that necrotic flesh can jump higher and run faster than that of the living?  It was just too much for me.  I really wanted to like this movie a lot, but the athleticism of the zombies and that all you had to do was watch them in action for a bit to figure out the chink in their armor (obviating the need for Brad to fly all over the planet) made me wonder if this couldn't be done in a half hour TV show.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was outstanding. It held my attention. Full of excitement and will have you reading all night. Simply wonderful reading. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a real love story.
B00F99EMRE|5.0|I always liked the original Vapor Trails but this is like a whole new release. Everything is so crisp and fresh. Sometimes when bands put out remixes but only most dedicated of fans can notice the difference but this remix is so good it's like night and day. Well done boys! A must buy for any Rush fan!

B000LTAY1U|5.0|My husband chose this watch as we were looking through a bunch of them. When it arrived, he really loved it. It is his casual wear watch didn't want paint all over it as he does maintance work!  The lighted hands in the dark are a great advantage. The canvas strap is great too matching the face. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a casual/work watch.
0385523394|5.0|Not sure exactly when I first heard about this book, but after watching, and really enjoying the Netflix miniseries based on this book, I had to read it.<br /><br />Piper Kerman made some mistakes as a young twenty-something that come back to haunt her 10 years later. After being convicted of smuggling drug money, she is sentenced to 15 months at a federal correctional facility in Danbury, Conn.<br /><br />In prison Kerman must learn the rules, both those from the officers and the informal rules set up by the inmates. She learns how to live peacefully, though not always successful, while in such close quarters to 1,000 women. Prison is such a unique situation, that they create their own cliques, guidelines, and traditions to help pass the time and not go crazy.<br /><br />I appreciated Kerman's openness about her experience. The utterly ridiculous way of life in the prison, and how it does little to rehabilitate or prepare prisoners to live successful lives once they leave. As well as the surprisingly cheerful and heartfelt experiences and relationships she had with fellow inmates. She was able to connect and make deep friendships as she was open to the experience, and accepting of the mistakes she made that lead her there.<br /><br />The book opens you eyes to the lives of the prisoners she meet, who it's easy for us to stereotype and make assumptions about.<br /><br />If you have only watched the miniseries I recommend you read the book too, since there are some differences, and a few main plot points are not events that happened in her real life.
B00F4FGC0S|2.0|I get that MGMT doesn't want to write \\"radio hits,\\" but on this album they have gone the extreme in the other direction. There are barely any hooks to be found, replaced by a lot of sci-fi bleeps and bloops. Maybe they're trying to make a point about pop music but it comes across a bit like they're giving everyone the finger.<br /><br />I should note that I enjoyed both of their previous albums. Hopefully they can strike a better balance on future releases.
B00338QENI|5.0|I learned alot about Johns Hopkins and the HeLa cells for which i had no idea until i picked up this book. Amazing that a cell taking from a person so long ago has done so much for Humankind!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book doesn't deserve a bad review. It was a great book but there are some points that I can agree with others on. Though the ending wasn't as bad as everyone says it was a bit fast. The end could have been more detailed but the epilogue was sweet.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The grandsons loved the movie and couldn't wait to play it on my Kindle. So I decided to let them download it.  It keeps them occupied.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|The fact that first season is free was great! Getting to know the characters even better! I could watch this season over and over!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I downloaded this for my 5 year old grandson.  He was so excited about it and he is really good at it.  He knows how to update his Ironman and he can make the character do things that I haven't got the ability.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've played games like this before, and this game is the best. The controls are the easiest to use and my kids enjoy watching the pictures get created. However, they make you review in order to unlock a bonus puzzle, that's kind of dumb.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I think Bruce is getting a little old for this but he seems to recover better than his son in this movie. Great bombs going off, helicopters crashing, people dying, computers crashing, communications failing and jihadists fleeing and my getting up to make some more popcorn which I enjoyed as much as the movie.<br />You have seen most of these action things before but it is always fun to see Bruce go through them one more time!<br />I enjoyed it, plot was fairly good and acting was okay. I liked the plot theme of the father-son competition as spies. Fun!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Loving my Chromecast.<br /><br />Got it set up within a minute using my laptop, just had to click a couple buttons and done. And now it just works.<br />Using Youtube and Google Music apps on my 2013 Nexus 7 casting onto the TV. No Netflix in Australia without a lot of work.<br /><br />Hoping sometime Google will open up local content to stream to the Chromecast, and let other apps use it too, so far Google seems to be taking their time. At the moment, it's the easiest and best way to use Youtube and Google Play on the TV.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Really good app. I never get enough sleep so  I really like that the alarm is loud. I will have to recommend this app to friends and family.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fascinating how this could have happened. Today with all the government regulations it could not happen. the interviews the author had with Henrietta's relatives made the book  come to life.I certainly learned a lot about medical technology relating to culture growing and marketing.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game keeps your mind working.  LOVE IT!  It will kill time if you need time to kill.  I have had this a while and I love to play it when I need a break.  I would recommend this for all.  It is easy to figure out and use.  I play it on my 1st generation Kindle Fire.

B00F35BV64|4.0|very good movie , a lot of action , althought i think that the first movie was better than these one...i
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This was slow and laggy on my device, after all the updates it has gotten better. Seems to work alright.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|After I installed this app on my Kindle Fire HD, I went and bought a stylus for it. I love this app! It is great for drawing and/or sketching and didn't take very long at all to get comfortable in using it. If you are used to working in any kind of 2D design software (Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Draw, etc...) then you will be able to grasp the user interface easily.<br /><br />USER TIP: Don't try to stroke across the tablet quickly like you do on pen-and-paper. This is an electronic device w/ a small surface area. So your strokes should be about half the speed you would use on pen-and-paper. This is not a drawback nor do I believe it is a &#34;flaw&#34;. Just realize what tools you are working with and how to best use the tools...<br /><br />The one thing I didn't like was that there are no selection tools. I'm not sure why this was left out of the app but, again, if you are used to working with 2D design software, you probably use area selections as much as I do. Especially when I'm sketching, I use selections to grab a part of my sketch and move it, proportion it, scale it, stretch it, position it, cut it and paste it. If it had a selection tool I would have voted 5 Stars in this review. Hopefully this will be added someday soon. In the meantime, I use Layers and the Eraser Tool a lot as a substitute.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this app as a great way to sketch on your tablet. Although, I strongly recommend that you buy a stylus just to have a more natural &#34;pen-and-paper&#34; feel.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|This was a good substitute for Google chrome on a NextBook tablet. It worked well and seemed safe. Very promising.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great! Great! Movie I can't wait for the next one. Hope the whole cast signs on for the next one.
B005R32L66|3.0|Tried using this for a NextBook, Didn't work with the tablet I had. However Skype is a great app and I have not had any other trouble with it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is easy to play and you can lose track of time while doing it! Nice graphics and user friendly as well. A good purchase!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Great app, just not for android... Froze up and crashed a lot on my Nextbook. This is better on any other device
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|How good is it to hear a great live recording? Yes the sound quality can be a bit poor and there are those distractions of footsteps and audience coughs etc, but there is an energy that can come across that captures the performance in the moment.  So it is with this Ernani.  A 60's performance from the Met with a truly marvelous cast.  Not having heard a lot of Leontyne Price - i'm a convert! She has that energy just below the surface of her singing that is ready to burst forth in a strong but controlled manner when required. Teamed up with Carlo Bergonzi and the others, this is an excellent rendition of one of Verdi's less popular operas (at least in modern days).  If nothing else listen to the penultimate track (Act 4 Ferma, crudele..) for the flavour - I wonder how many listeners in Verdi's days, knowing his sad family history, could picture him cradling a child and rhythmically rocking to this ? Just a thought.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I'm still working on the simple set of this, so I can't speak about the harder levels, but so far it's a neat little game, easy to play even on this small screen.<br /><br />Edit: OK, down a star now I'm trying the next level of difficulty.  I'm disappointed to see that it uses the same set of pictures.  Still fun, but it would be nice to have a new set of images to find.
0307743659|5.0|I had read this book not long after seeing the movie and was frightened by it probably due to the image of Jack Nicholson's descent into madness from the movie. I was determined to reread it when I heard of Stephen King's sequel, Doctor Sleep. I was surprised to see completely different aspects of the story that in my youth I had missed. The struggle of Jack Torrance with his desire to provide for and protect his family while dealing with his new found sobriety and the increasing and manipulative voices of the Overlook Hotel's ghostly residents. Wendy Torrance's struggle not to become her mother, her distrust and hatred of her husband and her fear of her son's special abilities. Poor little Danny Torrance, dealing with his \\"shining\\" abilities while trying to fight the hotel's evil forces who want him to become a permanent resident. Three mixed-up people snowbound in the Rockies for the winter which could probably make the sanest person insane. I felt more connected to this book than I did years ago, an unwilling silent observer to the events in the Overlook Hotel. I'm haunted by thoughts of what I would do in their places and in similar situations. I know this is a novel but the beauty of Stephen King's best novels are the connection you feel with the characters almost as if you're suffering right along side of them. Perhaps I will have to reread more of Stephen King's earlier works to see what I may have missed.
B0081SKYDG|5.0|If I had a party like this, I'd be in jail for a while, but I wouldn't even be mad. My house would be destroyed, but I wouldn't care. I think this movie is an inspiration ;)

B00DJ80VLS|1.0|This really hurts to have to do.    First off let me say I LOVE this band and the new material (which I love) sounds great on the 5.1 DVD included in the deluxe package. In fact I think it sounds phenomenal when played in 2-channel mode. The retail cd, however, is the problem.    Fans will get mad over this review but it's an absolute truth. Sonically, the cd/digital format of this product is inferior and I owe it to everyone to point it out. Hence the handful of listeners out there who understand what I am talking about may save their money. A few others who don't may take notice.    WOULD IT MATTER IF THEY SOUNDED LIKE THIS CD IN CONCERT???    Dream Theater is my 6th favorite band and this pains me dearly...to have this done to the retail cd of this release just takes all their hard work and takes a big ---- on it. Very sad. When does the madness end? When will the powers that be turn the volume control knob back over to the listener?    This retail cd is completely BRICKWALLED...stripping it of any emotion, impact, and power. A complete shame and in-excuse-able with all of the knowledge now out there on this topic. Yet it continues through willful ignorance.    RECORD LABELS, SOUND ENGINEERS, AND PRODUCERS...IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP. LOUDER and compressed isn't getting it anymore. The bands also need to speak up. Dream Theater, honestly, do you like all your hard earned work to be in the end squashed down/whimpified and mastered for the teeny-bopper \\"I-everything\\" listener? Or do you want power and punch in your sound? Many listeners out there just do not understand this concept. A quick A/B would clarify.    When we can finally arrive at the point where us consumers can get PROPER MASTERING on the RETAIL, we can then proceed to the enjoyable task of discussing the actual music.    P.S. AUDIO IS IMPORTANT ON AN \\"AUDIO\\" PRODUCT    Where there is no quiet there can be no loud.those listeners not in the know, here is a demonstration of this:<br /><br />[...]

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book made me feel like a kid again.  It was an easy read and had lots of imaginary wonder.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|As alarm clocks go, this one is fantastic. I had downloaded another one previously, but it only allowed me to set alarms in the morning, but I need them at other times throughout the day and night, this one works for that.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Great music.  I bought this album after hearing the song 'Thrift Shop'.  Most other songs on this album were just as good.
B008Y212PI|5.0|great game. lots of fun. enjoyed playing.good tutitorial to teach any one how to play. easy for all ages. what else can I say
B008Y212PI|4.0|Found this app to be quite entertaining,however trying to play the 10x10 is quite tricky on a small screen. Still good fun.
B000VWSI8S|5.0|Amazing jazz album, every track is pure gold. For the price, it is a must have for any jazz lover.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was addicted to this game for a long time hahahaah it's really fun for all ages love this game
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Fun for grown-ups, fun for kids, heck, even the dog liked it! You know whothe voices are, and it's great to picture the actors actually doing what the characters in the story are doing. Pop it into the viewer, make some popcorn, and have a fun time!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I loved this book.  The narrator was very easy to listen to and the writing captured my interest without fail, each time I &#34;picked it up&#34;.  Lincoln's life has always been fascinating to me but this book drew me in to the time period as well.  I've always thought that I understood the significance of the Civil War and thought it was interesting, after reading this book I seem to be fascinated by it.  I want to go revisit all of the sites that were described in the book and continue to learn more about it.  Such a pivotal time in the history of the United States with continuing threads reflected in today's problems.
B00CP9SRMW|5.0|It's  a classic for good reasons! Well drawn characters, beautifully written and a good portrayal of life in the 18th century.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I enjoyed this on a flight. Overall the concept for the book was interesting but there were a few implausible details that bothered me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Books come in all sizes and colors; this one is exceptional. The Book Thief is beautifully written: its words are delicious, thought provoking, historical, and full of wonder. I would color it gold. Essentially Zusak tells the heart- rending story of a young orphaned girl in WWII Germany. Along the way, the reader falls in love with a small group of neighbors from just outside Munich. The Book Thief is a story of love, friendship, fear, anger and unmentionable suffering. Its beauty is in the weaving of the story. Its ordinary characters are heroic and unforgetable. I learned an answer to a question that has plagued me for years. How did the Germans let the Holocaust happen? Read it. This is a beautiful story you will be glad you read.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Easy, fun to read story time book.  This is my second time reading it and I enjoyed it just as much as the first...
B008Y212PI|5.0|love the game. great balance between challenging yet still enjoyable. I'm usually not one to hang around a puzzle game fornlonger than a day or two but this ones great
B000HL09MG|4.0|What is it when marital love, lust and longing for variety borders on infidelity but stays in the relative safety of Fantasy? What is it when you gasp for air, flail your limbs violently to stay afloat, spit and cough out the water that hurts like the black and blue surprises of a complacent life? What is it when you open your eyes wide even though the salt water stings like hell and disappointment? What is it when you move through water in any way you can even though you don't know how to swim, to get to the boat you had been knocked out of? What is it when there is a body in that boat that is not throwing a life preserver, not lowering an oar in your direction, and not even snapping that five-fingered grappling hook at you? What is it when Billy Idol looks scared? What is it when there are more black roses and thorns than red roses?  What is it when you stopped making those vanilla bean bracelets that lasted only as long as the weekend at the Virginia Woolfe Inn? It's a life lived behind a mask. It's hiding. It's running through the rooms of a marital mansion--alone. It's a mean and vicious hide-and-seek. It's remembering the champagne of eternal desire. It's surviving the battles and rubbing balm on the wounds that scar over as hard won, endearing, memories. It's having a reunion of veterans of marital struggles. It's about that one last piece of Valentine's Day candy that is the last word of &#34;Eyes Wide Shut.&#34;
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank for another fabulous read Mr King . An amazing ride on Kings highway!  I certainly hope for many more wonderful journeys.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not too hard, not too easy.  It's just right.  I like that you're not racing a clock.  It's relaxing.  I like the number of hints you can get and that you are allowed a few mistakes.
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|Just realized that I have not stopped playing this album since getting it.  If you are here wondering, just buy it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|thistles are blooming here at angry homestead and the pictures that bring fond applications such as this one are truly mesmeric to behold
B000002G7E|5.0|They played this stuff in front of 100 disinterested San Francisco Hippies who didn't get it, at the Family Dog on the Great Highway, the same night the Stones played before 20000 devoted fans across the bay in Oakland, which some called their greatest concert ever (\\"Liver Than You'll Ever Be\\" was the bootleg that resulted).  Which concert was better?  No contest. I'll never get over this record or that night.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I've been playing for 5 min but good so far. Good graphics. Quick load for each page and help offers.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to learn and use. I can set alarms to music, have multiple alarms, make a good night stand clock if you keep the device plugged in.
B0007TKH66|5.0|This  Star Trek Series completes my entire collection of Star Trek TV Series. I have been doing the collection for over 10 years and have finally gotten the final series.  If anything happens to any of the DVDs I can get the replacement at Amazon.com.  Thanks for the quick, easy and undamaged product.  Love YA!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This show just keeps getting better.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It is a show that is just fun.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|As a long-time fan of both Sting and Elton John, I pre-ordered The Last Ship and The Diving Board on the same day and received them on the same day. Having enjoyed both, I am more impressed by The Last Ship. Sting explores the father-son relationship very realistically with lyrics that are quite moving, particularly in \\"Dead Man's Boots,\\" which has a similar theme to Elton John's \\"Into the Old Man's Shoes.\\" I also love traditional Irish music, and the instrumentation here is beautiful. If you are a fan of Sting's solo career, you will not be disappointed.
B003Y5H4SO|1.0|The characters are terrible and not just there character but the actual acting give it a direct to VHS feel. There must be a bunch of 12 year olds giving this good reviews. I would sew my face to my butt to save myself from watching this again. If only the devil could have came and took me to hell so I didn't have to watch. Seriously did some script writer find his kids elementary story for class and pitch it to a dumb studio. If you liked this movie, counseling is in order.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I played the game so I could watch the music video.  The video is sick in a cute way. Way to go!
B008Y212PI|3.0|Found flipping on free apps of the day . Slow start but very quickly became addictive . Get very cross when I make a mistake.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I never played a game like this at least in awhile. It is Fun and relaxing for all ages. I would recommend this game. Four stars!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I have being waiting for this game for for ever the had it on the iPod and women I looked on here it was ways to live it was really dumb but know that's is here  unspoiled happy THANK YOU LORD!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game so much.Most bingo or slot games just let u win and there's no challenge. But bingo blitz makes u work for every bingo buck and every coin and every key and every power up and every puzzle piece. I've been playing for a year and I've only completed one room. It definitely keeps you on your toes and when u win its so exciting almost like it's real money. So thanks bingo blitz.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever. If u like Subway Suffer then you'll like this game. I promise. It's just like Subway Surffer.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|easly 1 of the best books couldnt put it down. i so  love loved it very exiting!!!! BEAUTIFUL and WONDERFUL at the same time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is a very fun game, entertaining. Sometimes I get stuck, but then it will randomly give thirty free coins. Or you can rate it like this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was this book written by a 17 yr old? Let's see... Girl of modest means who is of all things, a virgin who has never touched herself &#34;down there&#34; ( says so in the book!), falls for a rich guy who happens to be rugged, gorgeous, handsome, beautiful, muscular, super rich, a pilot, a concert level pianist, has a very large penis, tremendous stamina in the bedroom, has a jet, helicopter, and butler but (!) there is only one issue!  He's an adopted child whose original mother was a crack head, doesn't know how to love and what do you know? He's kinky and a control freak. Oh, did I mention he did all this by the age of 27. Really? What planet did this happen on? This book was written for teenagers numbed out on cell phones. Best seller? That's an indicator of how far our society has fallen.  Don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Loved playing.  It was so addictive and I totally lost track of time. I would recommend this game for any age to play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game is easy to use and customize. Gets to good difficulty quickly. Just must deal with quick ad between each game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have played a few FlipPix art apps and have enjoyed them all. I particularly like the breaking sound of the tiles as they tumble off the grid.  It's pretty.... and a very hard game to quit.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Since day one this swivel sweeper had problems with the connection in the sweeper and unable to hold a charge.<br />I have had 2 swivel sweepers in past (one at office and one at home) and both worked fine until worn out.<br />Unfortunately I had discarded the box upon opening and doing the overnite original charge. I kept trying to use it with the defects and finally gave up.<br />When I contacted the seller, As Seen on TV, they would not replace as it was after 30 days and did not offer any other options.
031624662X|5.0|There are echoes of C.J. Cherryh, Iain Banks, and Frank Herbert in Ancillary Justice.  The novel is both familiar and fresh.  The writing is powerful and tense. The plot -- about which I will say little, lest I risk spoiling it -- is intelligent and surprising.<br /><br />The Radchaii are human but they consider themselves superior to other humans. The Lord of the Radch, Anaander Mianaai, controls Radch space with the help of thousands of genetically identical, linked bodies. Extra bodies seem handy (wish I had some) but they prove to have unforeseen consequences. The Radch rule by conquest, annexing other human worlds and forcing their inhabitants to join the Radch or to surrender their bodies to be used as ancillaries, otherwise known as corpse soldiers (an ancient practice that has been mostly abandoned). They justify their actions with the belief that they are imposing order and justice on the universe.  They control annexed planets by coopting the privileged class, allowing them to retain their social status provided they embrace the Radch.  The one exception is Garsedd, a planet the Radch destroyed because the Garseddai posed a threat the Radch could not tolerate.<br /><br />The protagonist of Ancillary Justice, having been manufactured by the Radchaai, is sometimes a ship called Justice of Toren, sometimes an ancillary called One Esk, sometimes other ancillaries.  As the novel begins, however, the protagonist is called Breq. All of those identities should be the same, but Justice of Toren/One Esk/Breq is having an identity crisis. No longer endowed with the abilities of an AI, Breq has the weaknesses of a human ... without quite being human.  In the first pages, Breq saves a Radchaai named Seivarden (who once served on Justice of Toren) from hypothermia.  The story then alternates between the present (Breq is tracking someone in order to obtain something ... more than that I won't reveal) and a past in which One Esk was serving the Radchaai, who had just used ruthless means to annex a planet called Shis'urna.  The final element of the story is the Presger, a race of aliens who once made pests of themselves by dismantling Radch ships.<br /><br />The novel's background is more intricate than I've sketched out here. It is initially confusing ... but initial confusion caused by complexity is better than boredom caused by pages of exposition.  Everything falls into place well before the novel's midway point. Ann Leckie plays with gender and culture and religion in ways that are compelling but subtle. Her prose is robust.<br /><br />The story builds upon a familiar moral struggle -- whether to follow unjust orders if the penalty for disobedience is death.  If doing the right thing will have dire personal consequences, is it best to do the right thing only when it will make a difference?  And how does one know whether doing the right will make a difference?  These are difficult questions and Ancillary Justice brings them into sharp focus in different ways.  More than one character, not all of them human, must make a choice of that nature.  Ancillary Justice makes the point that virtue is easy to achieve in the abstract but easily vanishes when the lives of the \\"virtuous\\" are at stake.  It makes the equally salient point that it is easy to judge when it isn't your life that is at stake. At the same time, this isn't a preachy novel.  Leckie leaves it to the reader to draw whatever lessons might be taken from it. The blend of philosophy and adventure, the imaginative culture-building, and the strong characters all add up to an impressive work of science fiction.ruthless means to annex a planet called Shis'urna.

B0027MJU00|5.0|The third of Gillian Flynn's novels I've read, Dark Places was as twisting and exciting as both Gone Girl and Sharp Objects. I'm glad I stumbled upon this author and look forward to reading more of her work!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you've never READ The Shining, you must do so prior to reading Doctor Sleep. The movie, while excellent in its own right, omits many of the details and subplots necessary to fully appreciate Doctor Sleep. I do not think this would be a great stand alone book but read in conjunction with The Shining it makes an outstanding sequel. Danny does and doesn't grow up to be the man you may imagine. King does well to show us every hero (and heroine) has a dark side. How they manage it makes them appreciably more human and understandable.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|What a shame! This film is nowhere near as good as it was when it starred Robert Redford back in the 70's. I truly felt that it was a waste of money.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this app!  I'm a fan of common sense solutions.  Has anyone ever told you that you have no common sense?  Well, if you can't do this, they are right!
B00594XOZU|2.0|I have this app for my phone and tried to log in on my kindle and says &quot;this seems to be talking to long. Please try again later.&quot; The next day I tried and same thing. I love this app but it doesn't work on my kindle. PLZ FIX ASAP!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|&#34;Zealot&#34; cuts through the religious agendas of the gospel writers and the later Pauline gloss to show a human reformer in his context. It's odd to say it, but this book could deepen the faith of humanist believers.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|well its awesome and so cool to play like x-tream and so Coll to play with and in tees ting
B003ZDNWOA|4.0|A good read. Very good reviews by Luca Turin and Tina Sanchez even though it's still subjective. The writers are predisposed to what they like. Also, too many negative remarks about Creed fragrances, which in my opinion is an excellent house of fragrance. Still, I very much liked the book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Being a big fan of this type of puzzle, I really like this version. The added element of completing the scenes is interesting. The controls and graphics are good and I like that there is no timer. As to the controls, it is great that you can select multiple tiles even across different rows or columns and then either paint (fill) or break (blank) them. Another good feature is that the app supports multiple players, so my wife and I can each play it even using different sizes of puzzle.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is a great LP for any performer and would be the achievement of a lifetime for most. Teaming with Crow and Buckingham put this over the top, sometimes it's not the best players that wins but the best team, in this case you get both, tight throughout. No brainer if you like Nicks
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the different variety of games, generally no technical issues and if they come up they are quickly fixed...over all great game
B008Y212PI|4.0|I didn't know what to expect as I was not familiar with this type of puzzle.  The tutorial was excellent. I'm enjoying the game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Thought I would give this game a try. WOW!!<br />I can't stop playing it!! Very addictive but so worth it!! Quick to learn. Try it, bet you will love it too!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Game is full and tests your deductive reasoning skills. Could become addictive!  Great for hours of fun and lasting entertainment to pass the time.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very easy all my kids use it from 5 yrs old to fourteen years old great for homework I highly recommend it
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Good book. Storyline was intriguing and maintained my interest throughout. I would recommend this book to any of my friends.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I really liked it. Lots of action and kept my attention through out the film. Yes, not everything is wrapped up in a nice bow at the end, but I think that makes this a better movie.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really fun. It's very much like pic-a-pix. The photos aren't well represented by the squares but that's not a big deal.
B003XE1DR4|5.0|Best value shoe for water, sand , looking cool and pretty too.  Comfortable foot bed for my injured foot. Rinse off to look brand new, over and over .
B00846REIS|4.0|Easy reed! I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book. Love Eva And Gideon together, the neediness of their relationship.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Angela's Ashes is one of my favorite books of all times. The story of the family as they lived in the slums of Ireland is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.  Death, desertion and the resolve to leave Ireland and go back to America makes this a classic story. Loved this book!
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Good read! Surprising twist that keeps you tied in. &#34;Greedy&#34; readers should be aware, you are likely to have a late night trying to find out the next part of the puzzle.
B001HN6918|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this movie.  In spite of one particular voice/actor who I normally can't abide under any circumstance, namely Jack Black.  But here, disguised as a panda named Po, he is acceptable (but he wouldn't have been my first choice).<br /><br />The story begins with a flashback, a prophecy of a peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman), who seeks to rule China but who, according to a soothsayer, is also doomed to be thwarted by a black and white warrior.  Here things go all Biblical; Lord Shen tries to exterminate the entire panda population (zebras were ignored).  Naturally, Po was overlooked.  Flash-forward, a new adventure.  Of course, Po's as incompetent as ever, a boob of great girth with good intentions.  Along come some metal thieves and the frantic five, plus Po, spring into action.  It is the year of the peacock; all is not well.  What follows is a lot of running around, scrambling; fighting/losing, with little progress made in defeating their newest enemy, a bird.  \\"I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.\\"<br /><br />It's more than a little annoying the way most action films are constructed, evil triumphs until the very last minute.  Sadly, it's a well-worn formula that most filmmakers stick with.  It does little, however to provide any real suspense (other than frustration).<br /><br />The score was fantastic, the artwork dazzling, I just hope part three, due out late in 2015, improves the story a lot.
B001G8XON0|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies.  We watch it all the time. A must watch movie.  Nice in bluray.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|The story was very long....didnt like how it began, seemed somewhat weak,which made it kind of boring at 1st! I think Kingsley character was strong,but fell short, particularly how he was portrayed at end....i guess they had no choice since the actual villain was......not gona spoil it 4 the nxt person 2 view! I honestly had 2 watch it 2x 2 actually \\"get what was really the big deal!\\"Maybe Stark cud of done better at storytelling n the beginning,maybe????? Still worth seeing n my book,lol. Nice 2 c Palthow n a nu lite...hmmm, Iron Woman! Or maybe let her keep the nu \\"powers\\" given 2 her by the villain, was really neat 2 c her handle the foe,kudos!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really liked this one since with every puzzle/picture you undiscovered a new piece of a big portrait :) I actually enjoyed this as a light casual break ...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little device is seriously one of the coolest things I own. The interface is incredibly easy to navigate, the app works great, and when they add the ability to push HBO GO and Hulu Plus through the dongle it will be my favorite possession by a mile. Could not be a bigger fan of this, absolutely recommend this to everyone
B008KHRODG|5.0|who does not love dr who. the extras are really cool to watch. my family just loves it and so will you
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Best alarm clock ever. Now I'm never late for anything! With this I have  accomplished A LOT. Thanks for this app!!
B00E9E4EC8|1.0|The musicians were fantastic!  Alan Jackson was country with a bluegrass backup.  Bill Monroe's Blue Moon of Kentucky was sung slowly  and interrupted in the middle to introduce the band and thank the fans.  Really!!  Alan Jackson needs to sit down and listen to real bluegrass before he calls himself a bluegrass singer.  Very disappointed!
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Several bands from the 70's & 80's tried to be \\"relevant\\" by following the current musical trends, but really should have stuck to what they do best. Yes, even Joan Jett has a rap song. Now that the smoke has cleared and we are left with a vast disposable musical wasteland, many of the trendsetting artists of the 70's & 80's are putting out some of their best recording since their heyday. Thank Goodness. This is one of them!
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Disney used to be my favorite company in which to get movies from because their presentations (discs and digital copies)and packaging was the greatest. Now they've hiked the prices up and downgraded the way we do digital copies. Now we download it instead of using the digital copy disc. It took forever to do this vs the old way.<br /><br />Movie I loved and I'd give that 5 stars.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. I have been playing for the last two hours!!! Finally a FAOTD that doesn't have intrusive unnecessary permissions so for that along I'd give five stars lol. All around great app. Fun logic game to play in your spare time.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Better than the first one. Altho the storyline follows the first in the twisting the original movies, it does great in filling in gaps previously left open in original.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all three books in the series, but was disappointed that after everything Primrose still died. I guess it's true to life. I am now looking forward to seeing the movies. I would recommend this book to every one it's a great read even though the ending surprised me.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good game. Challenges the mind which some people these days need more of.  I would recommend it as a good way to pass the time.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Way too much narrative for my taste. Each character introduced had a ton of backstory to wade through. I stopped only a few chapters in.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is lovely little brain twister!  The puzzles are not too difficult if you take your time.  My first game of this sort and I love it!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I don't do that much editing, but, I got this program for free and it works as advertised. Go for it.
B000WC39SG|5.0|Classic World War II story about Operation Market Garden. Star studded cast, great story and looks and sounds great on Blue-ray. The optimal setting for Blue-ray is a 1080p TV, that is the secret to making this already great story, a visual feast four your eyes. If you are a World War II junkie, this movie belongs in your collection.
0345529057|5.0|The deal I got for the 4 books was $16 dollars. Considering the e-book versions are easily $16 PER BOOK, I consider this to be a ridiculously good bargain.<br /><br />All the books came neatly packaged in an outer case. The font and everything is excellent. Not really a paperback fan due to the bending that occurs on the spine, but for 4 bucks a book, I could care less.<br /><br />The novels themselves are excellent. I have watched all the seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO, but wanted to read the books as well. I don't want to be one of those &#34;the books are soooo much better than the show&#34; guys....but...<br /><br />For $16 bucks, you can't beat it. Until they come out with the 5 book set for $20 :)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|very entertaining. would recommend it to my friends. looking forward to future games. keep up the good work.  cant wait to see what is next.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|Having issues sharpening it - mine came super dull - duller than a cheap axe blade...... for the money, I wish I would of bough 4+ more Mora knives.  It definitely is beefy though- I guess I am going to have to take it to a professional sharpener and see if they can put an edge on it that I can maintain. 3 stars for thickness of steel and price... that's about it.
B00EDAI19A|5.0|I love the emotion and passion that this band has it is breathe taking and sucks you into all of the emotion!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|The second book in the series and am more enthralled in the story's  grip than ever before.  Can't wait to start book no 3.  A cracking great story!!
0142001104|3.0|Content of this book is very interesting and fascinating. But it is indeed used book, the cover and inside paper are very old.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I got this app as free of the day. I haven't had any problems with it  on my kindle fire. I haven't played the whole game yet either, but so far I have enjoyed it a lot.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I've used these for years. They're great for running, very light weight, and the sounds is fantastic. The problem is they only last for a couple of months before the sound goes out on one side. It wasn't that big of a deal since they only cost $10. I would buy 3 or 4 at time. But $45 dollars for headphones that won't last more than a couple of months? That's just crazy. No way I'll buy them again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's getting interesting and he was right this book has changed my perspective about things in life. I'm buying the next one
B004W1GCQO|5.0|This is a awesome series. If you are a Downton Abbey fan you will enjoy this show as well. Check it out if you haven't seen it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Item works as advertised. It was super easy to set up. There are a few small glitches, but they can be worked through.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|God bless all of these men and their families. Especially Marcus for telling such a great and I'm sure painful story. An inspiration to read and just to understand the unbelievable toughness courage and determination this man had. A book everyone should read. God bless the SEALS. And all of our armed forces. God bless the USA.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Have just started playing this tonite and absolutely love it.  Very well put together and the graphics are beautiful.  Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Same type of game as another one I got as app of the day awhile back- CrossMe (and the color nonogram version CrossMe Color repeated just the other day).  Due to accidental clicks on the Crossme game, I was concerned when it was mentioned that you were allowed limited mistakes before having to restart (a concept I was familiar with from a couple of PC games- wouldn't be surprised if this was the same company).  However, unlike other nonogram implementations, a click only highlights a spot to be acted on with another click on the hammer or pen, so there is no problem with accidental clicks.<br /><br />In short, it is an enjoyable game and I would consider buying their other ones.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Won't download to my refurbished Kindle Fire (1st gen)! I had to download the &quot;TuneIn Radio&quot; app (free version) in order to get the &quot;Amazon MP3&quot; app. The &quot;AMP3&quot; app is INSIDE the &quot;TIR&quot; app. The &quot;AMP3&quot; app is located in the upper right hand-corner. And note, you have to be in playing mode in order for that icon to appear. Works good as such. I've been able to make purchases, access Cloud, and download to my device. Sweet.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is lots of fun. I like how all the pictures are real and on drawn. The game I  challenging but not so challenging that it is boring. I give  this ham  two thumbs up.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|This is the soundtrack from their new movie that is playing at show right now.  The CD is live, and since I am a big Metallica fan I think is awesome.
1476727651|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I've read most of King's other books, and I thought this one started out great, but as the novel continued, I felt like the characters were \\"steam\\" themselves - rather flat, fairly predictable, often forgettable and uninteresting.  I thought the story had great potential, but King leaves too many gaps with the True Knot - too many unanswered questions.  Toward the end, I felt like the final conflict wrapped up way too easily and some of it was just a bit corny.<br /><br />Overall, it is not a terrible book, but the book isn't scary and the characters often feel like they are just reading lines for a play.  I would label the whole thing \\"simplistic,\\" especially compared with The Shining and The Stand.
0099519852|5.0|Well written, well supported information. Written with a blend of humor and clearly supported research, this book is a keeper.
B000YGIIPO|5.0|I have no idea why this is labeled as a children's book. This is a fantastic story and can be incredibly dark. I want to make all the people I know read it, but this story makes a fantastic point. Most of them won't read it because the main characters are animals and that is seen as being too childish despite the content. After reading this I'm seeing the truth of that in a whole new light. We can claim that we love animals and truly love our pets, but we can't even take a book with one of our pets as a main character who actually talks to humans seriously. Incredible. I don't think I'll be able to look at a rat the same way again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so freaking awesome.you should try it.when my friend told me to down load it I tried it and on the first try I got 3 boxes and ti unlocked trickey and I was so happy.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Cool game but my main complaint is the things don't like em really. Fun and addictive but too repetitive. Four out of five.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun challenging puzzles that keep you playing.  Really addicting.  So many different options you can play for hours and hours.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I liked the Lion Kind when it first came out back in the day. Now, I absolutely love the 3D version of the Lion King.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Do not usually like  these types of games but turns out to be surprisingly addicting...5x5 are super easy but once you get up to the higher grids, you're brain definitely gets a work out!
0838577016|4.0|I Love neuro. This book isn't an easy read, but the subject isn't easy either. So make of that what you will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's for all ages to enjoy.  It's funny and addictive so I say everyone get this app you'll love it!  I have personally recommended it  to everyone I know.  You won't regret it just get it.
B001HN6940|5.0|I love this movie. The storyline is great. I love the visuals and effects. If you like Johnny Depp you'll love this movie. His portrayal of the mad hatter is absolutely stunning.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Classic King. I highly recommend you read or re-read the Shining first. The movie really was different and you'll enjoy Dr. Sleep more for having done it.
B000HL09MG|3.0|A very disjointed story but Nicole Kidman looks amazing..This was Stanley Kubrick's last movie and as usual he tests the limits of unspoken erotic thought.. The sound track is wonderful featuring the Shostakovitch Waltz Suite #2
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Took a while for me to get into this book because of the characters and the jumping back and forth.  Not really my \\"cup of tea\\" but it wasn't bad.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I give this a 5star rating because of the acting, story and special effects.  Have enjoyed the Startrek movies in the past.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The dialogue on this show is brilliant, witty, and sharp.  You will easily fall in love with the characters and wish that this show lasted more than one season.  Truly before its time.
B00594XOZU|1.0|RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD GET 0 ZERO 0 ... I have been trying to download KIK on a new phone for 3-4 days & have emailed KIK & have gotten no response!!!! (Well I had to put one star or this wouldn't post)
B007MHVVCU|2.0|While I'm usually tempted to read anything with super powers this book was not only lacking a bit of charm but the action was slow and forced. Not worth the price.
159463176X|5.0|Have read Hosseini's other books and couldn't put them down.  THis is the same quality, and it is fascinating.  Quality is good, and it is hardback.  Love holding a real book in my hands.  Shipping was very fast!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd is a really good movie, cough up the 12 dollars to help it get the sequel it deserves. I guarantee it will be better than the last crappy comic-book adaptation you sat through.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is super simple to set up, the instructions are extremely simple and straightforward, the rest happens quite magically.<br /><br />I've had this product for about a month now and enjoy using it with Netflix on my phone, tablet, and laptop, have also used it to play a few YouTube videos. I haven't tried streaming music through Google Play Music yet, and have only played with casting my chrome browser, haven't had a real need for it yet.<br /><br />I have noticed a few issues in quality of the stream from time to time, but it usually resolves itself quickly. Another thing to note about Chromecast is that it does put out a constant stream. One of my TVs only has one HDMI input, so I use an automatic HDMI switch.  Chromecast and Verizon FiOS put out constant streams, so the switch's automatic feature doesn't work well, requiring me to press a button on the switch to manually change inputs. On my other TV which has multiple HDMI inputs built in, I have no issues, just change the input with the TV remote.<br /><br />One of the great things about this product is that it doesn't stream from your personal device (phone, tablet, computer) which would drain the battery, instead, it streams directly to Chromecast and allows you to control (play/pause/scrub) from your personal device.<br /><br />I would recommend this product, because it's simple and it works. In fact, as I type, my mom who is retired is casting a YouTube video from her phone.
B002M7A79S|5.0|I recommend that you watch the TV series first to appreciate the characters and then see the movie (Serenity) to find out where all the loose ends are going. Jos W had a lot of great plot lines to keep this show interesting if it was not cancelled after only one season. I think the name, Firefly, and maybe not enough marketing were the issue. That said, in 2003, if the show was not about wizards, it was not getting much audience love. Firefly is like the A-team meets Star Trek (Deep Space 9) done as a Western.Now I have to call it, \\"Castle in Space\\".
B000V39KDO|5.0|I enjoy this item and really liked it so has my family and friends I look forward to purchasing similar items in the future
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An extremely believable account of the historical Jesus. I found it very compelling reading.  This book makes sense<br />I could not put it down.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|I enjoy this item and really liked it so has my family and friends I look forward to purchasing similar items in the future
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good movie! A must watch especially if you have read the books. Great use of time and can't wait for the next one!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is a fun game. I love the monsters and the video. Though there are four things to look out for. First, this game is very bogged down with adds. Second,  the airplane mode requires a certain kind of kindle but you can turn that mode off. Third it gets difficult in later levels which lead to violent throwings of the kindle. Fourth I had trouble with this game,  it ended up crashing my kindle so beware of that also. Another thing is that gets repetitive after a while. I give it 4 stars because I did have fun with it and it is a totally free game but be careful since the ingame adds might lead to unintentional buying. Otherwise a pretty fun game.
B008Y212PI|3.0|good for free app of the day I don't like requiring facebook for bonus game access. Tried to bypass to get to next level of difficulty but it kept sending me to loyalty bonus game's
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks uses the devastating and apocalyptic scenario of a worldwide zombie infestation to express the best and worst of humanity.
B009MYARIK|1.0|Terribly disappointing and predictable. Horrible story. Worst book I've read in a long time. Waste of my time. So disappointing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is great to watch!  I love learning the history of the time period through the eyes of the top and bottom sides of the house.  Can't wait for the new season!
B00BUVLQNI|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows that is across the pond. I would recommend it to anyone who likes there humor. Maggie Smith has some of the best lines in the show. It is a show that will last a long time in anyone homes because it takes places pre world war 1 and post world war 1. What the family in the show goes through is astonishing.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|What an amazing record.  Great sound, great jams, great mix, great songs, great vibe, great beats, great great great great.
142314189X|5.0|I am a big fan of Greek mythology even tho is series is meant for young readers I enjoy how it brings it to a more modern age. In the books Riordan knows how to connect to the readers and find away for the reader to feel like you are there with them. I must have read this series twice now just waiting for the next book to come out.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It keeps my five year old busy and thinking<br />And I like playing it when I am on the bus
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|The storyline was good. The graphics were good. I thought the puzzles. were lacking.  I did not like how abruptly the game ended.  The ending needs more excitement.
B008JIWNYG|5.0|I have been reading green lantern for over 30 years. Not many can say green lantern has been their favorite for that long. This is my first time on an iPad. I loved it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have to have the entire series and this was the beginning of the end. I love the series and have seen each one in the movie theaters. Now to finally own the series, at a reasonable price, was too tempting to jump on it! And I did!<br />It came sooner than the dealer said. I got it in 3 days!!!!!! It was perfect and played in high def. Nice and clear.<br />Now I'm after the part 2. The final chapter to the series! Can't wait until it arrives!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A fantasy within a fantasy within a warped reality.<br /><br />For true geeks the extreme details of general geek knowledge gets boring. Still the story is told well. Characters are complex, yet virtually real.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The dynamics between the 2 main characters is great. The humor is well injected, and the characters are well developed and enjoyable.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The book starts out slow as the author describes his background and how he got into the Navy and the training (BUD/S) involved with becoming a Seal. However, when he gets on the ground in Afghanistan with his fellow Seals, this is one of the most exciting true action stories I have ever read. I immediately read the part describing the battle in the mountains again. It really impressed me how brave, courageous, and dedicated these highly trained men are. I believe these are the world's best soldiers. They deserve our respect and appreciation. I would recommend this book to most anyone.
B000001FKY|5.0|This is a great album to collect and to listen to for music lovers and fans of this legend band.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a surprise even after reading the other reviews I thought it was hype too good to be true. This is an amazing book. Great characters amazing plot line and a setting that reveals enough to make you want more. Very well done one of my favorites already.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|The best story there is to tell of any tale. I am in love with this books, I will continue to read them until the last one.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Lots of fun. Got both my wife and I addicted. We like the pictures and the challenge. Keeps the old mind mind moving.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and especially loved the author's use of language. The story engaged my interest from start to finish and I found the characters superbly developed as the novel progressed. The only negative aspect was when the &#34;hangers on&#34; joined Harold and I was annoyed as they interfered with his story. A truly beautifully told tale.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Great characters development. Still a bit hard to suspend my disbelief.  Give the guy some powers please!  How can he possibly compete with all these super powered beast men when his only ability is to see them for what they are.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb is an incredibly addicting game but I'm wondering why I don't get updates when they come out. I play everyday and I hear about new updates from friends but don't get them. from a kindle user
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this app.  It is a great game to play competitive with the family. Beware highly addictive and loads of fun.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It isn't working! I have tried to log in multiple times... AND IT STILL HASN'T WORKED! I have deleted it and reinstalled it... my friends are actually getting mad at me for it not working. I have had it forever then all of a sudden it doesn't work... I thought I deleted my kik account I went on my friends ipad and it worked... just please fix it... please
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Pretty straightforward app. Has a nice flow to it and looks nice. I don't find it to be a battery hog, as others suggest.
B008Y212PI|4.0|sort of like sudoko meets minesweeper. graphics reused from other games. you'll likely get your couple buck's worth of entertainment from it.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|just plain fun and moderately difficult, it just takes a while to learn how to beat them, then it gets easier
B00475AYJQ|5.0|After 1000 pages all I want is more of this wonder filled world and it's inhabitants.... I'm afraid of the next book but cannot wait to read it,
B003GK22HA|4.0|Clearly the best of all the Taita-books. It's Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone and Ben Hur all rolled up in one, with Egypt(ish) sprinkles on top. Entertaining all the way through.
B007AMMZA4|4.0|It's difficult to write a review for this film without revealing the plot and spoilers. You definitely don't want to know too much about the story in advance so that you can truly appreciate the twists and turns of the imagination of the brilliant director Pedro Almodovar.<br /><br />When I selected the movie, based on the previews, I thought that it was the story of a gifted cosmetic surgeon who restored the face of a beautiful burn victim. I expected a feel-good story with a happy ending. Had I known more about the works of Almodovar, I would have had different expectations !<br /><br />Dr. Legard (Antonio Banderas), a renowned surgeon, operates a clinic where he researches the latest advances on skin restoration. We learn via flashbacks that he lost his wife after a terrible accident in which she was badly scarred by fire. His daughter is also emotionally damaged as a result. We start to glimpse images on a closed circuit camera of a slender woman completely ensconced in a skintight body suit who appears to be locked In an austere room at Legard's home/clinic. But she seems to be calm and content to be there. Why is she there? What is wrong with her? Why is she not able to leave?  The housekeeper is complicit with the doctor and seems to be the only other person who knows about the patient.<br /><br />The patient's back story and predicament is revealed through flashbacks interwoven with current scenes, and the horror of the story builds scene by scene. It is impossible to predict how the plot will proceed and you will be astonished at the conclusion.<br /><br />The genre of this film is described as \\"drama, horror, thriller\\" and all of those descriptors exist in equal measure. There is violence, graphic sex and language in this fascinating character study. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the screen.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Not really familiar with John Mayers' work, but found this to be extremely pleasing. The Blu-Ray offering is astounding in audio, as well as video. Can't really ask for better. For others considering this disc, but who like me are unfamiliar with JM, he reminded me very much of the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. So if you're a fan of SRV, I'd say you would definately be pleased with John Mayer.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|After reading this book I couldn't wait to see the movie.  Great book!  I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I'm starting to get into the concert videos now, and not a really big fan of most of the newer music with some notable exceptions. Older videos transfered to DVD or Blu-Ray really don't have the quality unfortunately, because the original source recording just wasn't technically capable. So I'm seeing older bands that I loved growing up, but I'm wondering, do these guys still have it? Can they still rock like they used to? In the case of The Eagles, without question, YES! This disc contains the old favorites from The Eagles, as well as highlights from solo works. Joe Walsh is back in top form and (thankfully) plays my personal favorites from The James Gang, and The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get album.All in all, this will satisfy the Eagles fan out there.
0321934318|5.0|Scott Kelby is the master.....His insights and directions are very helpful...Amazon prompted me for eight more words....A good buy.others have tried.Jim
B001GJOL22|5.0|Another fine concert video, made that much better by being on Blu-Ray. Has the typical song line-up, and of course a great drum solo by Neil Pert. Some may say the camera switches around alot between stage and audience, that's no concern to me. I don't need to have a constant focus on the musicians, as long as the music is un-interupted, who really cares?
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Like most people I have been waiting to see if Cher would ever put out another CD, not that she needed to, special since she did her farewell tours and finished her shows in Vegas.<br />But Cher has a unique voice and talent, that would be sorely missed if she does not put out a CD at least once in every decade. If you take away the wigs, the wild, near naked outfits, the plastic surgery and the tabloid stores, you will still be left with Cher's powerful voice, that convey character and emotions so effortlessly. A bad record for Cher will be a good record for so many of today's so called divas.<br /><br />After \\"Believe\\" which was a great CD, Cher became a dance floor Diva and got the attention of a new generation. In fact I think \\"believe\\" was one of biggest EDM hits of all times. But those of us from the older generation who knew what Cher was capable of waited and hoped that she would not just become a poster girl for EDM<br /><br />This CD, Closer to the Truth, is a perfect showcase for Cher's true identity, with a good mix of dance music and ballads. It shows her range vocally and emotional, there is something here for everyone, new and older fans alike. While some may be disappointed that it isn't all dance music, some maybe surprised to hear the dynamic range in her voice on the ballads and slower songs.<br />I know there is a lot of comments about the heavy use of Auto-Tune in her songs, but the use of voice treatment software for EDM is very common place for all major artist in this genre.<br />Personally I find, that Cher's voice has gotten better over time, like a good wine, which can be heard on the slower numbers where no voice treatment software is used, and her real voice is heard.<br />I think with this CD, Cher has come full circle in her career. It is allowing us to see closer to the truth - that which is Cher.<br /><br />I think this is a bold move by Cher to take a chance instead of playing it safe with a CD of just dance music. But then again taking chances is one of the things Cher does best.<br /><br />After one listening to the this CD I find the stand out songs are \\"Woman's World\\" Take it like man\\", Dressed to kill\\", \\"Red\\", \\"I walk alone\\", \\"Sirens\\", \\"favourite scars\\", \\"I hope you find it\\" and \\"Pride\\"<br />.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I purchased this as I wanted to use it for the smaller carry on as if fits perfectly under the airline seat.  I flew Southwest, and they seem to be more reasonable with what you carry on. I had a pair of Frye boots (mid-calf short boots and I wear a 6), make-up bag, my liquid travel bag, curling rod, IPad, my purse, and a couple of items of clothing and such in there with plenty more room.  I just didn't want to stuff it too full. I like the hard compartment up at the top to put phone, plugs, chargers, or anything else you don't want crushed.  Quality of the backpack is top notch.  I have the matching rolling suitcase to carry on board. When walking through the airport, I can lay it on top of my suitcase, and it rides nicely because you may not want to carry it long distance due to the weight. I even purchased stuff while on vacation and found ways to stuff more in both.<br />I'm glad I purchased this as I do not like to check bags when flying.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I have been working on/struggling with down sizing for several years now.  Feel that I know many of these basics, but got side-tracked with a stroke.  That, unfortunately led to many rooms becoming dumping rooms for stuff which I could not get around to sorting/cleaning/clearing out.  I am totally ready now (with frequent breaks) and have been getting back into my To-Do list that I had for each room from 8 yrs ago.  The goal may not be as minimalist as the author, but I know right where I want to end up.  I finally see the end in sight, though it may be months from now.  I'm a happy reader and will gladly recommend to others.
0596007124|3.0|I really don't like the way they teach but they organized patterns very well. I noticed I use to use many patterns that I didn't know were patterns :)
B002VWNIDG|1.0|First, I consider \\"Shining\\" to be the greatest novel ever written, so take my opinion with that in mind.<br /><br />I remember well standing in line for two hours outside of Oakbrook Commons theatre, almost trembling with excitement to see this film.  It was the most anticipated \\"event\\" in years for my circle of friends.<br /><br />The lights went down...and we watched \\"King Lear Meets Jack Torrance\\".  The ENTIRE CONCEPT of the book centres around the premise that the evil of the hotel slowly peels away the layers of Jack's sanity.  In this tripe, Jack is bat-shoot crazy from the first frame on!<br /><br />Oh, and all those \\"hip\\" and \\"edgy\\" shots of blood flowing from the elevator and dead twins and a boy talking to his finger like Reagan O'Neil and some weird landscaping maze and Jack breaking through a door and yelling \\"Here's Johnny!\\"...none of those elements were in the novel...know why?  'Cuz they have NOTHING to DO with the STORY!  Know what WAS in the novel?  Topiary that came to life and tried to kill people.  A possibly real, yet benign spirit who manifested to Danny at the moments when he was needed the most. A competent, wary and spry Dick Halloran who LIVES.  A strong, determined, mama-grizzly Wendy who loved her son and would never be found whimpering and cowering in hallways.  Overall, I'd say, you found very faulty, yet very human, and very likeable characters.<br /><br />What do I remember most about that night in Oakbrook?  An audience walking out in total silence, absolutely appalled by what they had just seen.  This silent crowd slowly blending into a blurred mass as tears formed in my eyes.  I'm serious, \\"Shining\\" is my favourite novel ever, and this abomination actually moved me to tears of grief.<br /><br />Everyone faces their own demons in their own way.  That's the lifeblood of the \\"Shining\\" novel.  This waste of film is about a self-absorbed director spending two and a half hours showing us all how \\"cool\\" and \\"trendy\\" he is.  I can't come down on all the Kubrickites who think he can do no wrong...I went through the same thing with David Byrne in the 80's, although 20 years later, I watched \\"True Stories\\" again and I was all, \\"What was I thinking?\\"<br /><br />OK, so why did I write this, like, 33 years after the fact?  Well, \\"Doctor Sleep\\", sequel to \\"Shining\\", has just been released in hardcover.  I'm sure it will make it to film one day.  Also, Halloween is coming up in a couple of weeks.  So my sincere wish is that if either of these two events have moved you to consider buying \\"Shining\\", I'm hoping this review will save you from making a horribly regrettable mistake.  Please, for your own sake, don't ever watch this.  It's absolutely worthless.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Loved the book.  Reminded me of my tom cat and the personality he had and in general how cats have personalities.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun for all! Everyone in my household loves this addictive game. We fight over who gets the next puzzle. Wonderful!
0399536108|5.0|It is hard to describe how much I love this book. So, I'll keep it short and sweet. Somewhere in you, behind all the stress, bad memories, and innumerable reasons not to be motivated lies a great person. This book helped me find that great person. It will help you, too.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|Bought one to use with my iPod mini during workouts.  Initial pairing went okay but subsequent pairings sometimes require patience. Add to that a $50 price tag and one questions the value vs using wired ear plugs for workouts.  Furthermore, while the small size and sleek design are attractive features, it is VERY easy to misplace.  A way to hook or attach it to a gym bag or the iPod armband when not in use would be helpful.
B008458O3S|4.0|like how the skills increase as you go....haven't reached the advanced levels YET.  Fun game to use while traveling.  :)
0307477401|4.0|I'm impressed at the degree to which, in a detective fiction genre, Mankell has delivered a psychologically rich portrait of Wallander in this this book, along with a departure into spy fiction that has not been part of the Wallander series before. The detective fiction has Wallander playing a role more similar to George Smiley, rather than an action hero, and it works. The story is intensely personal, integrated with his family life, and forces Wallander to confront the many issues of his life. I enjoyed it as much as any other book in the series, perhaps even more, and am sad to see it come to an end.<br />My only complaints--there are too many \\"I just happen to have a friend who is an expert in exactly the area I need to clear up right now\\" moments. It comes across as a bit contrived. I also think Mankell failed to make the central antagonist a convincing character. Sure, on a plot level, it works, but we don't get down to the \\"why\\" the character turns out to be who he is. I also think that Mankell misses an opportunity to develop the character of the antagonist's son.<br />But let's set aside these complaints--this is a detective novel that goes far beyond a procedural narrative to deliver a satisfying story, not just a momentary reading diversion in our otherwise too busy lives. For that, and for the entire series, I am grateful.

B00E9P959O|4.0|I will keep this short. I am incredibly grateful and happy that Rush have come through and have given this album a complete remixing/remastering. If the original record was a stuffy nose on a high allergen day, these mixes are an open and deep breath on a clear day. Neil's drums are now crisp and punchy and have a commanding sense of domimance to them. Geddy's bass has more high end spank than previously heard and the listener can really hear just how well he is working with Neil, all the while carving out his own space in the songs. There is more intricacy to Alex's guitar/mandolin parts than I heard in the original recording, though they still retain their dark tonal character (no doubt an artistic choice). I did notice that they were often pushed farther back in the mix in favor of highlighting Geddy's now present and clear vocals.<br /><br />Speaking of vocals, they have now become the focal point. In the original recording, they were squashed down and always seemed to be fighting to say \\"I'm here\\", especially in as thick of a piece as \\"Secret Touch\\". Now, the vocals are front and center with beautiful high end and you can really appreciate just how good of a singer Geddy actually is. Vocal harmonies have been shifted in volume, making for a whole new take on the original songs. Indeed, this is more than just a few EQ/fader adjustments...this is a completely different approach to the album.<br /><br />Despite my appreciation for this re-release and the much improved sonics of these songs, there is one thing I find myself struggling to get past: the reverb on Geddy's vocal. Any aspiring mixer knows that the best reverb is the one that doesn't make itself known and here, Geddy's vocal is often drowning in it. I am not familiar with David Bottril's work (though I do know some Tool) but he seems to love a dripping wet vocal. Given his attention to detail on the rest of the tracks, I cannot understand why he felt such a choice was what Geddy's voice needed to stand out...there is already plenty of high end and presence here already. This quip aside, though, I stand grateful that Rush gave this album a proper new life and always, I will continue to see them every time they come around :).ut...there is already plenty of high end and presence here already. This quip aside, though, I stand grateful that Rush gave this album a proper new life and always, I will continue to see them every time they come around :).

085786078X|4.0|I like Simon's Cat and I picked up a book finally when I saw that I could get it used on Amazon.com. Its a very quick read since you don't actually have to read anything. Its all hilarious pictures of the two cats doing their cat like things. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Simon's Cat YouTube videos.
B00D5EWRHW|5.0|The song \\"Need it\\", by itself, is worth the full price of the album.  When I first downloaded this album I listened to that song over and over so many times that I lost count.  I actually fell asleep listening to it on repeat.  \\"Need it\\" is an amazing song.  Definitely one of my all time favorite songs.  The entire album is very enjoyable, when I can stop listening to \\"Need it\\" that is.  I am so glad I came across Half Moon Run.
B00407PNY2|5.0|This is a very high quality DVD to watch it also comes with a great case to store it in.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|This set is top notch. The sound is remarkable and the mix just right. I am a Keith fan and really enjoyed hearing his contribution throughout all of the songs. The movie is a lot of fun. I appreciated the simplicity of the times. The contrast with concerts of today is striking. There is such a relaxed feel to the scene. There is no staging and people just hanging out around the stage. A couple times small kids go running across the stage mid song without even a glance from the band. There is a dude, completely naked, perched on a pole behind the stage and at one point the camera zooms in on Jerry soulfully singing away and the dude is framed next to him shaking his bones. Quite a scene. Lots of fun, completely enjoyed it.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|This album is a must have as a white lion fan. This is probably their best album in my opinion because every song is good and has a catchy chorus. I also have the Mane Attraction album which isn't bad but Pride is better. I would recommend this to any 80's rocker.
0470449764|5.0|This is one of two GMAT prep books I think is a must-buy for anyone. If you are struggling conceptually, this won't necessarily help, but you'll be able to diagnose weaknesses and do a ton of problems that will help you get the problem solving process down.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Love this app! I only which there was another area where I could practice and learn more vocabulary words. That would take this app over the top!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book definitely held my interest...compelling story with a thought-provoking message.  I enjoyed the epilogue...or the &#34;what if&#34; musings of the author.  Makes you stop and think????
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like games that challenge me and make me have to think about the moves that I am going to make.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I have never heard of this book until a friend recommended it.  Although, I'm currently divorced, I thought what do I have to lose.  As I read from beginning to the end, I thought \\"aha\\".  I understand where things went wrong in marriage twelve years ago. This information will help me in the future.

I have done all things possible to try to log back in on my Kindle Fire and for nothing but the same message telling me I should try again in a little bit. I have went and searched Google for help, reported this problem, and now its time to start getting results because there are plenty of other messengers that will work.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|My daughter and I started using Duolingo several months ago, and we both find it an excellent learning tool for foreign languages. She has loaded the app into our Kindle Fire HD, which increases the availability of the material. She has not yet used the offline mode, but I'm sure it will make the program even more useful.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|As always, I was very impressed with the writing of this book. Picoult always does her homework and research. She writes with so much character, she really brings her characters to life, and it's always a surprise. This book shocked me, brought tears to my eyes and a smile on my face. It is ALWAYS a good novel, that while reading, can bring a person so many emotions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app, for a free a app. its challenging, fun, and entertaining. i don't like being forced to make a review to keep playing, but the game is worth it, so i don't care.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Would be a great game if there wasn't so many issues with gameloft.<br /><br />I love playing the game and playing with friends

1781162646|3.0|I have been a fan of King's since I was in college and picked up a copy of The Stand. I've probably read more than 90% of his work. He has put out some amazingly creative work.  It seems, though, that he's been losing his enthusiasm for the craft. Or maybe imagination. Or Mojo. Either way, I think this decline has finally gotten to the point that I have stopped reading King, although I find it hard to hear myself say that. Sorry, Steve.
0316204366|4.0|I really wanted to love this book more than I did. Malcolm Gladwell has an inviting writing style and he introduces a great premise: the little guy beating the big guy. Everyone loves a triumphant underdog story, but in this case, I'm not sure the underdog is clearly defined.<br /><br />If there's anything I hate in these types of books, it's a weak analogy. Malcolm draws from several real-life stories, but the title-bearing story of David and Goliath is the one with the least amount of merit. It's like David going to battle with a stone and no sling. Or, worse yet, the characters swap sides. Gladwell takes a lawyer representing the U.S. Government, named David, and likens him to the Biblical shepherd boy bearing the same name. Does something sound out of place there? Yeah; that's what I'm thinking. Yes, the lawyer David comes from a humble beginning, but he was armed with a degree from Yale--much more than a sling shot--when he fought his own  courtroom giants.<br /><br />And this is the shaky foundation upon which the rest of the story is built upon. There are interesting and cheer-worthy ideas that Gladwell presents, such as finding strength in weakness, but none of them seem well supported. Yes, I thought it fascinating to learn about these successful people that achieved and overcame their disability, but is all their success contributed to the sole influence of that disability? Doubtful. Gladwell, though a fantastic writer, struggles to effectively prove his point.<br /><br />I'll give Gladwell credit for one positive element: making me think. He doesn't leave his ideas to simmer on the philosophical backburner; he stirs in a few studies that provoke thought. But again, we go back to the shaky foundation, where Gladwell's arguments are precariously balanced in the form of pseudo-scientific structure. In other words, the studies he presents are enough to give pause, but when examined further, aren't enough to support the entirety of the argument. Yes, I get it: those with a disability may be forced to work harder and thus benefit more, but I don't think there's enough evidence to prove that those without a disability can't benefit by equal practice.<br /><br />Should you read this book? Yes, for two reasons. One, being the aforementioned thought provoking material. The other, being the fantastic stories that Gladwell shares. He escorts us along from cancer treatments to the civil rights movement, from college selection to the prison house. I appreciated my time with Gladwell and feel more worldly and expanded because of it.those with a disability may be forced to work harder and thus benefit more, but I don't think there's enough evidence to prove that those without a disability can't benefit by equal practice.<br /><br />Should you read this book?

B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy these picture puzzle games. This one is unique and I like the spin on it. A great way to waste time.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Why, in a collection like this, would they include the regular cut of Khan (which is awesome), but the extended version of The Motion Picture (let's face it, nobody bought the set for that one)?  I are confused.<br /><br />Apart from that particular little quirk, it's just what I expected.  All six TOS movies, in HD, on Bluray.<br /><br />This should keep me busy for a little while...
B0081X40HW|4.0|I love Haley's voice and she is super talented, but these songs are so overproduced.  Her Tin Cup videos are far better with just her and a keyboard.  The Tin Cup performances just seem to let her soulful voice stand on its own. Frankly, her voice is best when it is not overpowered by all this strong drums and other noise.<br /><br />Haley, if you are listening, all the noise in these songs is for other performers to cover that they don't have your voice, give us some soulful stuff with you and a keyboard or just a guitar.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This character was beyond  neurotic and he made for an immeasurably needful person! I didn't think anyone could be that crazy and still have a modicum of functionality!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Nice logic puzzles. Addictive game play but not too hard.  Give it a shot, you might like it a lot.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|One the edge of your seat action from beginning till ending. Great suspense, great twists and turns. Overall very good movie!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very addictive.  Great fun and entertaining.  The pictures are so cute.  It could probably be a little harder.  But it is a little challenging.
0385523394|5.0|Honestly, I didn't pick this up expecting to be wowed.  Not sure why, thought it was going to be another prison book I guess.  I read this in one setting.  The story of Piper Kerman's incarceration though reminded me far more of Frankl's In Search of Meaning.  Kerman's outlook helped her to focus her energy and time towards making the most of the situation.  Kerman's strategy:  \\"I went into it. . . thinking, one year is one year, and you can survive anything for one year. . . focusing on what positive things I could find. . . I didn't focus on the people I really didn't like.  I didn't focus on feeling bad for myself.\\" (p. 322).  Wonderful stories told through the lens of a positive outlook engage and help us to see clearly the humanity of the women in prison and the seeming banality of the 'prison system.'
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book once I got started in it I could not put the book down I love reading good romance novels
030758836X|1.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this book....put the author's other two books on my wish list in anticipation of future enjoyment.<br /><br />Then I hit the halfway point.<br /><br />The book turned boring mid-way.  It took me a long time to finish the book.  And as others have said, the ending is just stupid.<br /><br />My wish list is now two items shorter.
B008Y212PI|5.0|So at first I was skeptical about this game. But I downloaded it anyways and started to play it. it was a little difficult at first but as time went on I got the hang of it. I suggest this game to anyone that loves puzzles!!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Looking forward to reading the sequel.  Love the turns in Destiny, especially the philosophy behind free will and Destiny and how the world moves when they cross.
B008D28HYS|3.0|No mistake CrossMe Color is an excellent puzzle game. The user interface is clean and actually quite relaxing to solve the puzzles. Sometimes brain teasers like this can be therapeutic. The cumulative reasons for this 3 star rating would be the steep asking price and some excessive prompts for buying other games from this same developer. The developer should remove the excessive purchase prompts to buy [[ASIN:B007JM4CWY CrossMe]] (Which by the way is an excellent puzzle game) and this could easy achieve 4 star rating.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love puzzle games that make you think but aren't so difficult that you don't want to play. I have been solving the pictures using the 10 x 10 grids which are hard but not baffling. Just start with the larger numbers or patterns and you will be off to a great start.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Nothing but a warmed over zombie movie--nothing original except HD and maybe better graphics.  The real point of this movie becomes obvious at the end when Pitt states somberly that we haven't won, we still have a long way to go.....<br /><br />Stay tuned for WWZII.
B003G4W49C|5.0|my son had to read this for school and loved it and keeps telling me its a must read wants the other ones.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. I wasn't really sure how it worked before I downloaded it, never having played a game like this before. The tutorial was put together very well and taught me exactly how to play. And then I was hooked! Very enjoyable. I like games that you have to think about, makes me feel like I'm not just wasting time but actually exercising my brain.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|really good game nice control and challlenging lots of different cars and stages like the way you can power up your cars
0061950726|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.. the relationship and bond that forms between the two main characters is so unlikely that when it happens it is delightful.. Vivian although elderly is funny, witty, and more in tune with the 17year old's feelings and difficulties than the foster family she is in or the other adults in her life.  As I learned about the orphan trains and how hard the trip was and the lives that often followed with new famiiies it is a wonder that many succeeded and became productive adults.  The characters are well drawn and the plot intriguing.. Only the end left one loose thread that I would have liked to see pursued but all in all, good read and great book club discussion novel.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sometimes I want something that's light, refreshing, and goes down easy. I don't always need depth and darkness. That's not to say that Steelheart was all butterflies and sunsets - far from it - or that it completely lacked depth. It wasn't and it didn't. But some of the book felt like the writer rushed through just a bit. The science seemed a little brushed off at times, not thoroughly researched and fleshed out. Some of the characters left a little to be wanting.<br /><br />But none of those things bothered me at all. Because this booked passed all the important tests:<br /><br />1. Got me through my plane flights without noticing the hours that went by.<br />2. Kept me inside my hotel room reading obsessively when I should have been out seeing the sights of the city.<br />3. Kept me wide awake and feverishly reading into the wee hours of the morning to find out what happened next.<br />4. Made me feel everything that happened, good and bad, right along with the main character - whom I liked a lot and rooted for.<br />5. Made me grin widely and embarrassingly in public due to the sheer awesomeness of some scenes. After all, that's what Brandon Sanderson is a specialist at: the awesomeness factor. While reading I know that the author geeks out for badassery just as much as I do - but in a deliberate, well-written way...not in a wannabe fan-fiction kind of way.<br /><br />The plot is an interesting, original concept (though I'm sure something similar has appeared in some graphic novel somewhere), where people have begun developing superpowers, but the ultimate strength and invincibility they're granted corrupts completely them until they end up tearing the world apart with their petty battles and power grabs, leaving a broken world of semi post-apocalyptic sections of society ruled by overpowered tyrants. There are no heroes. Just average people who aren't willing to take any more cruelty from they're power-drunk rulers, and fight back using wits, secrecy, masterfulplanning, and lots of firepower (which all add up to being just as badass as superpowers in their own way).<br /><br />Anyways, I definitely recommend this book. If you feel the need to interpret every sentence of Jack Kerouac's On the Road or analyze the many layered meanings within Ulysses and refuse to lay eyes upon inferior prose...then go away, this is not the book for you. If you want a fun book that will make you devour it's pages with gusto (as well as pose a few interesting questions about morals and the value of life) then this IS the book for you.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is a lot of fun and very sddicting.  Wish that there were a few more levels but can't complain be queen it was free.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I love  it. Consider this title if you are a newer pop music fan. Goes well with Blurred lines Robin Thicke. I would definitely recommend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Severe addiction!!! This game is awesome and I couldn't stop until I'd beaten it 100%.  I believe anyone who plays will be just as addicted just as quickly....so beware! Make sure you have nothing a need for a few hours prior to starting.
B00BGD8CFK|3.0|This would be a very good case for the iPhone 5 I would imagine. It has one glaring flaw for the 5s. You must take the case off to use the charger. Back it goes.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Downloaded this to my Dad's tablet and he is pretty low tech.  He needed a simple to use voice recorder for his meetings, and I wanted a digital file to do the editing for him.  The three buttons were pretty simple for him to use.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoy the Flip Art puzzles. They are relaxing and entertaining. I like that you can change the difficulty of the puzzles. Luckily this was the free app of the day but I would definitely pay for this app.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was a very entertaining and intriguing story. it was unpredictable, frightening and always kept me in deep thought about what would happen next.<br />  I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as they could handle a bit of suspense and violence. This was a great book and I can't wait to start reading the sequel.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Just finished playing this puzzle/game. I liked it for the most part. I started on the easy ones first now I'm going to try the more difficult ones. I can see how this could become addicting.
0670024856|5.0|In her soaring new novel, The Signature of All Things, Liz takes us on her epic journey through the world of Alma, a pioneering woman unlike any you have ever met. What I loved most about this book is the richness of the characters, their lives, learning some unusual new words and discovering a world I never even thought about before -- moss!  This book drew me in to the very last page and I was sorry to see it end. This is a book of genius, originality, beauty and grace.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Although this app is good and strangely addictive, I seem to have a problem playing it on my kindle.  My kindle only permits me touching two spots at once.  Please add an option of a two touch screen so that myself and others like me can actually have a chance to play this through more.  Other than that small detail, this game has me hooked and including the music video was a great idea.  I'm glad we can go to settings to turn off the airplane as well.  I'll give you the last 2 stars for that fix.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I could set the alarm, but it never went off when it was suppose to.  When it did go off, no sound came from the Kindle Fire.<br /><br /> In order for the sound to work, the Kindle Fire sound has to be set to DIGITAL.  Once I did this the alarm work.

B00EP22QKG|5.0|Reviews, I feel, benefit from a little back story. I was about 10 years old when I first discovered Joan Jett. It was the late 80s and I was obsessed with leather pants and teased hair. Not on me, of course, but on the rockers in the metal videos I consumed every day. So when \\"I Hate Myself For Loving You\\" came out, and here was a rocker wearing leather pants and teased up hair, who was actually a female--and a badass female at that--well, I was hooked. Up Your Alley was actually the first cassette I remember buying with my own money. I had gotten others as gifts or through trade or hand-me-downs or whatever. But I paid money for this one.<br /><br />Obviously, I later discovered that Joan had recorded even better albums, both on her own and with The Runaways. But `better' is almost an unnecessary term when it comes to Jett, because she always rules. And Unvarnished is no exception. With the opening chords, followed by a HEY!, and some powerpoppy hand claps, \\"Any Weather\\" lets you know that the Queen of Noise is STILL not interested in trend hopping.<br /><br />I'm not much for track-by-tracks, but suffice it to say, Unvarnished doesn't let up and Jett keeps the fun rolling right to the final note. Lyrical content ranges from relationships gone bad (\\"Soulmates to Strangers\\") to commentary on entertainment in the 21st century (\\"TMI\\" and \\"Reality Mentality\\"). And aside from her voice sounding older (but only slightly), this record sounds as though it could've been recorded in 1983. In fact, this album would fit seamlessly in between the yellow record and Glorious Results...<br /><br />If you like any of her records, you will probably like this. If you are one of those \\"Oh, I only like the old stuff\\" types, well, you will still probably like this--you just won't admit it. The bottom line is this: Three-chord rock n' roll will never die. And Joan Jett has and will forever see to that.

B00BEIYLAW|5.0|My husband read the biography on Jobs (which Jobs, himself, had much input on) and my husband said the movie did a good job of staying true to the book. We both very much liked the movie and thereby came to appreciate the man even more. Definitely worth having this movie and seeing it again. Very inspiring! (I don't honestly think you can be a MAC user and not love this movie :)
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It's freaking awesome!! Wished I had started watching it earlier! Can't wait until the new season begins on the CW!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I've always loved this story and the acting and characters are perfect. I would recommend as a must see, plus it's free!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really enjoyed this game, played all the way through!  Would have loved more levels.  Keep more games like this coming? It is fast and fun?
B00AERRKHA|5.0|This is a must read for fans of the Vorkosigan saga. Funny and amusing, this is a great story focusing on Ivan Vorpatril's perspective with much and more hijinks involved in this tale than even that of his more famous cousin.<br /><br />For new readers, this is perhaps not the ideal starting book as it is quite further along chronologically speaking but the unique perspective allows for this story to hold its own for readers who have just picked this up off the shelf with no heavy references needed from earlier books in the saga to enjoy the appeal of this story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only problem I have with this game is that it needs to be longer, other than that I give the game four stars
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Too long, had some interesting parts I guess. I struggled to get through it because I started it once before and didn't finish.
B009XY97VC|4.0|What I've come to expect from Two Steps From Hell and a great addition to my collection.  A surprising variety of awesome scores.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Love this app, but....since my last update, my phone had been randomly vibrating day &amp; night &amp; FINALLY figured out that this alarm app had been sending &quot;next alarm&quot;notifications every 10 minutes or so &amp; apparently causing my phone to randomly vibrate, but not every time?! So annoying but can't live without it since i don't have to remember to set my work week alarm nightly! :)
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Loads of fun, even if you're not a despicable me fan.  All my friends at work have gotten addicted to this game.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I use this app daily.  It works awesome! I love the different versions you can customize the clock with.  DO NOT BUY FULL VERSION!!! the paid full version id not worth the money.  It freezes and locks up constantly.  I have tried everything and cant stop it from screwing up.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Clears space and cache very well. It tells me what space is left and what's taking up the most space and really boosts my kindle firr
1781162646|5.0|I stayed up until 2 am on a work night to finish this in one day. Seriously, I could not stop. Just read it already. You won't regret it. Great story.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was extremely impressed with this app. All other apps that I have previously downloaded did not live up to expectations. So thank you for this app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. Spectacular book!...recommend to anyone that loves excitement in a book. Definitely addictive will have to read the other two of triology
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a bit challenging but quite fun. Just when I'm about to give up I finally am able to find the solution and move on to the next floor. I can't wait for more to this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of my favorite books!! In the begging I wasn't too sure if Mockingjay could be as good as The Hunger Games or Cathcing Fire but, it has surpassed my expectations!! I am in absolute shock right now. I LOVED it!!!
B00F91H666|5.0|Excellent movie.  Great effects and I kept tense at all times.  Great actors - Brad you're the best.  THANK YOU
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Perhaps this is due to the fact that Fox prematurely cancelled the Firefly series, inspiring Joss Whedon and his team to write an epic tale that captures the characters we grew to love in the series.  Not only do the characters backstories become more fleshed out, but they are built into more complex characters through the acting skills that are on display through the duration of the film.  Major drivers of the stories are shown, additionally illuminating why River was so important to the Alliance, and the danger her knowledge poses to their power, as well as some of the mysteries of the universe - including Reavers.  You won't be disappointed!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I personally didn't know about the orphan trains so I found those sections very interesting and moving.  The modern day sections were less gripping.  But all in all a very interesting slice of life story.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was so different from anything I have ever read.  A personal journey so gritty and passionate that I could not put it down.  I love this book.  A must read for anyone the I know.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Games is insidiously addicting. You want to finish just one more puzzle to finish the scene. Then want to &quot;see&quot; what's the next scene and get sucked in again and again. Lot of fun.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app every day. Timer and variety of sounds make it superior to similar apps. User interface is hands down the best.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|works great. I now have a dependable alarm. has cool lights and sounds. and music is great on this kindle fire. yeah
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was a great movie that kept you engaged to the end.  I did not want to miss one part.  Brad Pitt was at his best.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|OK, I this movie is pretty good, as a part of the whole Star Trek continuum. What's pretty bizarre though, is the plot's metaphoric parallel to the fall of communism in the latter part of the 20th century. Though there are Russian flourishes at times, the Klingon Empire seems directly cast as communist China.<br /><br />Spock mentions the old Vulcan proverb, \\"Only Nixon could go to China\\"; in fact, President Richard Nixon did indeed visit China at a time when it was the archenemy of the United States. In this movie, Captain Kirk is a metaphor for the anti-communist Nixon. Because it had been so isolated, China was very much an \\"undiscovered country\\".<br /><br />China is a recurrent theme, not only in some of the Klingon names (e.g.: Commander Chang), but in more subtle ways too: the shattering of Sulu's china teacup, and in the table setting for the diplomatic dinner with napkin rings, and; once again; the delicate china dinnerware.<br /><br />If you're binge watching all the Star Trek movies; Star Trek VI is not to be missed!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wonderful story line.  Great cinematography!  I love it!  I will watch it over and over.  Fantasy or reality?  Take your pick.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am absolutely, unabashedly in love with this little gadget. I've played around with streaming devices of various types, including the usual suspects of SmartTVs, AppleTV, Rokus, the Xbox360 and more traditional HTPCs. And for me, the Chromecast is far and away the ideal means of implementing the core abstraction of \\"Use TV to display content\\". I know you can read this caveat in any of the thousands of other reviews, but I'll say it again here; this is -not- just a cheaper version of an AppleTV, or a Roku. It is not optimized for streaming local content (though it is possible). It is not capable of displaying content from any source. It is not even a finished product; the software is still under development, so don't expect the Apple polish and shine. If you are expecting any of these qualities, you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />But, if you forget about all of that, what you get is a supreme interface for using the devices you already own (your iPad, your smart phone, your laptop) to transfer media (specifically, Netflix and Youtube) to a larger screen, effortlessly.<br /><br />SURE, BUT WHY IS IT BETTER THAN OTHER STREAMING DEVICES?<br /><br />If you've used any other TV media devices before, you know how much the interfaces suck. Frequently, they are constrained by the requirement of an input device (usually a remote with a handful of buttons, or a controller for a game console). Searching is reduced to using a directional pad to painfully select each key from a keyboard, or a tiny keyboard on the back of the remote itself. Remotes work just fine for channel-based TV, where all you need are rockers to surf. But when dealing with internet based content, searching and interaction becomes so much more crucial, and the transition to that kind of paradigm, without the appropriate shift in input devices, yields a profoundly frustrating user experience. The genius of the Chromecast is that it doesn't try to reinvent the user interface, or the input device. Instead, you use the same interfaces you're used to, that have been developed and optimized for this kind of media; the websites themselves if you're using your laptop, or the various apps on a phone/tablet. Once you've selected your media on one of these devices, the Chromecast takes your selection and broadcasts it to the screen. No booting up SmartTV apps, no syncing input device and streaming device. It detects what you're trying to view, boots up the appropriate software, and begins streaming the content. It really is a thing of beauty. And on top of that, once the streaming begins, your device is free. It's not doing the work of streaming; just pointing the Chromecast at the target media, and letting it run. So no battery drain and no 'lockdown' of the device.<br /><br />This is the epitome of good user interface design. Clean, pure and simple. No menus to navigate, no apps to load. The software is doing all of the work for you, and I truly hope that this is where the future of 'The Screen' is headed; use any device to select media and display it on any screen with zero effort.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD as well as my mobile phone, workstation and laptop. Works without issues on the Kindle, which is critical because you find PDF files everywhere.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|a good read, interesting, easy to read.  a good start to the series and makes you want to read the next one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|this book started out with a great concept. about halfway thru it lost steam. i kept wondering where it was going. then it just ended. with the worst ending ever. too bad, beacuse it had so much potential and the characters were very well developed.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I do not know how many times i have made up a 'to-do' list or reminders and then left them behind. No more. They go wherever i go.  I can keep track of books i want to read, and check off the books i've finished.  I easily keep track where i am on projects for clients, or web pages i need to read through at another time.  I've even used Evernotes to keep track of medical events/statistics that need to be shared between specialists, or created check-lists of prescriptions i need to have renewed.  My husband can easily add to our grocery list, even while i am in the store. This is a wonderful convenience that i use daily.  And for free, no less!
B00BDSRISA|1.0|from a collector who appreciates many varied genres i cant think of another artist who has shown so much promise from their debut album pheonix.united to churn out such overly produced crap as this.Have they lost an integral band member?With each release ive witnessed a steady decline.My top 5 who are heading for the scrapheap and who promised so much in no particular order.(maybe those that rated this highly may love these artists now)the EELS/AIMIE MANN/BEN KWELLER/BADLY DRAWN BOY/SHINS.
B0063M22QO|3.0|First time playing this game.  Read there is some problem going to other levels.  May get boring but right now I am interested.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While there are many devices that allow you to watch both Youtube and Netflix on the big screen, finding and selecting videos to watch always left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />No more! I can now use the ultimate device to find videos and play them on whichever big screen is graced by a ChromeCast.  I've been watching more internet streamed video than ever before.  ChromeCast also lets me play music from Google Play from my phone or tablet directly on the stereo (this is where I have ChromeCast plugged in)<br /><br />As a bonus, ChromeCast automatically switches the selected input to itself whenever you start to play something so you don't have to look for the remote as long as the TV is on.  Perhaps in a future update, it will also be able to turn the TV on and off.  I'll be buying more of these for friends and family.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great storyline and character development...my initial thought had been that the topic would be morbid but it wasn't at all...it was a very life-giving story with a redemptive ending...I highly recommend it!
B008XBHIEY|5.0|What else can be said about Jaws (1975)?  This Spielberg mega classic still has the same effect on this viewer nearly four decades after I saw it for the first time the summer it came out.  So many of us are still afraid to go into the water!  I got to see the mechanical shark that was used in the movie at Universal Studios back in '76.  This movie has good acting, the movie is frightening, the characters are memorable, and the script is excellent.  And did I mention the special effects?  Superb, considering it came out in the mid 1970s (who needs that annoying and cartoonish CGI?).<br /><br />If you're up for a different kind of horror film, then Jaws will deliver.  You need to see this blockbuster mega classic.<br /><br />Extremely highly recommended!!!!

B008Y212PI|5.0|Enjoyed playing the game. it reminds me of lsat preparation. end pictures are a bit silly but still a game that i like. wish they didn't repeat though.  the shape can give away upper levels if you remember the picture from the lower levels.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is perfect for a Senior Citizen who wants mental exercise without a stressful timer. It's really well done, with clipart-type graphics that go together to create artistic scenes. I am really enjoying this app.

If you have problems they are very quick to address them, and take care if you.  Report problems using the 'stuff' button, and fill in the blanks.  Great team of tech support!!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Great package.  Arrived in mint condition.  This series is awesome!  I am not much of a zombie fan, but this series has so much more to it.  Lot's of great situations that come with the breakdown of society.  Buy it.....don't wait.

B00EP22QKG|4.0|It's been easy to write off Joan Jett in the last two decades. The rarely-released albums were scattershot at best, with production, writing, and vocal skills all over the place. For every killer cut (\\"Fetish\\", her cover of Sweet's \\"AC/DC\\") there were five so-so tracks and one or two downright embarrassments. The live shows still rocked, but that's where the legend ended. SINNER, released in 2006, was a step up but still too hit-and-miss to make many ripples in the still lake that her recording career had become. With UNVARNISHED, Joan Jett proves that there are still waves to be made, and she and the boys are just the folks to make 'em.<br /><br />  Despite a strange and hopefully-ironically-intended album cover (a closeup of Jett makeup-free would've worked; should the cover of an album called UNVARNISHED look like everything in the picture is covered in varnish?), Jett for the most part is as straight-forward as it gets, playing to her strengths as tough-chick everygirl. The result is her most satisfying album since 1994's PURE AND SIMPLE (which in my mind is the best thing she's ever done by far).<br /><br />  The proceedings start out with a hot stutter of guitar and a \\"Hey!\\" from the players, starting the pop-rock of \\"Any Weather\\". The song is a little muted by unnecessary piano, but that and the cliched lyrics are outweighed by a clever arrangment and solid playing from the \\"band\\" (Jett and guest Dave Grohl). It's a good warm-up for \\"TMI\\", a high-energy continuation of Jett's Gary Glitter tribute fetish that kicks in hard and stays there. This would have made a better leadoff track, but it's great wherever it is.<br /><br />  From there Joan keeps the train on track for the most part. The biggest booster for Jett here is longtime drummer Thommy Price, who is firing on all cylinders with turbo backup consistently. Whether on the pop-rock of \\"Soulmates to Strangers\\" or the clapalong intensity of Jett's blistering commentary on all things Honey Boo-Boo-like, \\"Reality Mentality\\", Price pounds the skins like they owe him money and he's taking extra interest. The rest of the band rocks serviceably (more guitar solos!), but Jett and Price are the one-two punch that knocks most of the album out of the park.<br /><br />  As with nearly any Jett project, there are missteps, but ships are mostly righted mid-course. A so-so chorus on \\"Fragile\\" is instantly offest by the bridge, where Joan spells out the title with a fervor and goes all Aretha on our asses, and \\"Different\\" makes you think it's gonna be a \\"I Hate Myself For Loving You\\" clone before kicking in with hard playing, a great arrangement, and impassioned vocals about the glory of going your own way.<br /><br />  The only real duds here are \\"Hard To Grow Up\\", which just never catches fire and even sports a couple of obvious guitar screwups early in the track, and the closing, awkward ballad \\"Everybody Needs A Hero\\". Ballads always point out Jett's vocal limitations (although the vocals get better as the song goes on), and the attempt to throw a nice little, um, varnish on the track with a string section and an oboe fails. It ends up sounding like a demo that barely made the cut, for good reason.<br /><br />  For true fanatics, the \\"deluxe edition\\" gives you three extra live tracks and, um, something very weird. No spoilers here.<br /><br />  While Jett's always on in concert, her last albums were spotty at best and embarrassing at worst. Both qualities are less in abundance here - UNVARNISHED is a great surprise to those who were declaring her over, and a powerful I-told-you-so for fans to rub in. It's Jett's best in nearly 20 years and proof that she still has the will, the means, and the power to rock you. You have been warned. Don't make her send Thommy after you.

B003G4W49C|3.0|I've known about the existence of Ender's Game for more than five years, but never got around reading it until two weeks ago. Imminent movie release will do that to you. While I did like the book, it didn't really live up to my expectations.<br /><br />The best thing about Ender's game is the characters. Ender Wiggin is an interesting character to read; smart, strong-willed, and has the fair bit of moral complexity that these types of books generally lack. The supporting characters are also pretty great, though it is really easy to forget how young they're supposed to be. One young, really smart person is one thing, but an entire school of them is a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />The worst thing about Ender's game is Card's writing. First, the vague details. Through the first half of the book, Card barely bothers to describe anything, whether it be places like the space station or people. This lack of detail can be annoying, especially when it comes to the games. It's hard to take him seriously as a master strategist when they don't describe his strategies much. Fortunately, Card course corrects near the middle of the book.<br /><br />And then their's the school itself, as a concept. The teachers take a total laissez-faire approach to the game, letting the older students teach the younger students everything military, with the teachers focusing on math and english. Look, maybe the reason you don't have good military commander's is because you don't teach your students anything.<br /><br />The other problem is the montages. Huge swaths of time go by in the blink of an eye with details compressed into a single paragraph. Many of those details could have been interesting stories by themselves, but were just ignored. It makes me feel like the book should have been twice as long to fill details. And of course my last problem was that the ending, to me at least was predictable.<br /><br />Still, the plot was enjoyable, and the epilogue was pretty good in and of itself. Not sure I'll bother with the sequels though.. Not sure I'll bother with the sequels though.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Arrived at door step on day of release.Brand new, no damage.  Love the movie, love the extras especially the short film &#34;Item 47&#34; which was a great tie in to the movie. Recommend buy
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's funny, I went back and forward liking him, not liking her.  Then liking her and then not liking him.  I also knew she was alive and jerking him around.  When I though they were not going to get back together I was mad and sad.  I wasn't even sad for the guy she killed.  I wonder what this says about me?  Boy and girl together at any cost.  My happy ending.
B002M87W2W|5.0|Awesome!  I loved this movie!  A wonderful musical film!  One you can watch again and again!  Tootie made the movie!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|What I enjoy the most is the the historical aspects interwoven with the fascinating characters.  You will enjoy the story so much that the characters will feel like family.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoy puzzle games that are not too difficult but provide enough of a challenge.  This game has that.  I am only working on the easiest level but have been enjoyed playing.

B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a fabulous story. Heart breaking, hopeful, beautifully written; it is a story that takes you through the whole gamut of emotion.  The whole history Orphan Trains was unknown to me and what a blight on our society back then. To take children and literally sell them into god knows what conditions was a disgrace.  But this story rose above it and Vivian and Molly were beautifully drawn characters.  Loved this book.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|I thought there was a lot of rambling with little to no point, but perhaps that was the point? It was a decent read, but be prepared for the nasty gore.

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I liked the story, sobbed like a baby as the story played out ... but in the end as an adult it's a simple book you will skim through. If that's fine with you, go for it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is great because you are too I love the dragons and how you can have two islands at the same time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is certainly not dull! The story line continues to develop the characters upstairs and downstairs, but it does not outshine the suspenseful twists and turns of the plot. I particularly enjoy the unexpected-alliances and outcomes. I look forward to seeing how season 4 can top this!
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|This movie is a fantasy (it is set in an impossible world). It is not science fiction. You have to accept that premise, I think, for starters.<br /><br />Even so, this movie didn't work for me very well. I gave it 30 minutes and then fast forwarded to the end.<br /><br />I think it has two main problems:<br /><br />1) It stretched credulity too far. I was not able to \\"suspend disbelief\\" and accept the world and its bizarre physics. I guess it's possible for a movie to be too imaginative. The hero's accent (New Jersey?) didn't help - why is a guy from New Jersey in this fantasy world?<br /><br />2) The pace was too slow. It needed more urgency. The hero was too laid back. We needed to see him desire the girl more. We needed more tension and more tangible opposition to the characters' goals.<br /><br />Also, Kirsten Dunst is a very appealing person but I just don't think she's a good actor. At least the director didn't bring that out of her.<br /><br />Like I said, I didn't finish the movie. Did the characters grow by the end? If not, then that would be needed too.

B003P2WO5E|3.0|I've only read Sanderson's Mistborn Trilogy, the Alloy of Law, and The Rithmatist.  I'm aware he has some other stuff out there but I really haven't gotten to it yet and I don't have the desire to read his stuff at the end of the Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />Oh and spoilers probably.<br /><br />Throughout this book I waffled between moderate enjoyment and wanting to bang my head on the desk.  There were occasional moments when I was genuinely excited to turn the page, but not enough.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Most of the characters were enjoyable.  Kaladan and his bridge crew, Dalanar and his sons, and I even liked the other high princes (not like as in I would hang out with them but I thought Sanderson did a great job with them).  Sandersons world building is amazing of course.  Cool magic system.  Lots of interesting things like the grass retracting into the rock.  The highstorms are cool.  Dalanar's visions are a really neat plot device.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />Biggest offender first.  Shallon is the most obnxious character in all of literature.  I hate her more than what's his name in Great Expectation (and I hate that little guy a lot.)  Our introduction to her does her no favors.  She is described over and over as clever.  Like seriously, a dozen different characters call her clever in her first appearance.  The thing is that the things she does are decidedly NOT clever.  Her so called clever or witty responses to compliments and people just trying to talk to her make her sound more like a smart ass child than someone clever.  Her scheme to steal the soul caster is unbelievably bad.  The only reason it worked (sort of) was because it had to in order to move the plot forward.  I still don't understand why she didn't mail the thing back the second she had avoided suspicion for taking it.  I'd skip her bits entirely if there weren't tiny nuggets of necessary plot in them.<br /><br />One of my problems with having a world that is 100% different from the our world is there is no context.  When there is no context one of two things happens; either the author has to spend a ton of time explaining and then re explaining or the author forgoes explanation and we just amble on confused.  For example.  Every time a character gets a sphere, Sanderson has to spend time explaining how valuable that sphere is in relation to other spheres.  The spheres in particular are complicated by the various types of gems within the spheres and I think even the size of the gem stones.  Of course there are other things like this but I just thought that was the best example.<br /><br />Super spoiler for the last thing I didn't like.<br /><br />Kaladan kills the shard bearer.  Doesn't take the sword.  Totally didn't buy that.  His reason was not good enough or at the very least not developed enough.  I get it, this is the sword that killed your friends.  So they are all dead because you went after it and now you are throwing away their sacrifice.  You seriously had the power to change the world with that and you throw it away and you HAD HAD HAD to know that Amaram was going to do something like that.  If Sanderson needed a way for a light eyes to screw Kaladan out of a shard and make Kaladan hate light eyes, there had to have been a better way to do it.

This video may be simple enough for absolutely anyone to understand and implement, but it is more informative than any textbook I read while I was in college. It goes in depth, for us marketing professionals, and gives examples every step of the way. He lays out exactly what you have to do to not only survive in this \\"likeable\\" world, but gives you the tools to thrive in it. I consider myself on the cutting edge of creative and social marketing, and I owe most of that to Dave Kerpen. You really should also follow him on twitter, bc he puts tons of articles on there, and also tweets all of his LinkedIn articles there.<br />Seriously, check him out, and check out this book.<br />Brian Wallingford
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Once all of the characters in this book are established it moves right along.  It just seems to take a while to get to that point.

B003WE9TU8|3.0|Being a zombie lover, this was a must read on my long list, but I somehow managed to watch the movie before the book. The movie was awesome, I really loved the concept behind the zombie warfare and other countries gearing up to defeat the apocalypse in different ways.<br /><br />However, the book itself was a shock. It's called World War Z, because it's mostly filled with stories from old war veterans who experienced the zombie war. Filled with interviews from a bunch of different people all over the world, post zombie apocalypse, the book mostly explores the warfare behind each country and the weapons and strategies they used to mitigate the zombies.<br /><br />What I liked about World War Z<br /><br />- Some really interesting accounts from unique people. My favourite was the one of the Japanese sword-wielding otaku (or nerd) and the blind Japanese guy.<br />- The amount of research the author has put into the every location featured in the book, the warfare of each country, and all these different people is astounding.<br />- Treating the zombie apocalypse as a global epidemic. I really enjoyed the different locations from around the world and snippets of what these places are like postwar.<br />- How the author explored how the zombies attacked and came to be in such detail across the world. I always thought an oil tanker or a submarine would be my best bet for surviving the zombie apocalypse. - - From underwater zombies, to fast zombies, huge walls to keep the zombie out, zombies in Korea, it's all covered here.<br /><br />What I disliked about World War Z<br /><br />- Written in a dry, boring, and dull manner. All these people have the same personality (or, no personality).<br />- I needed a dictionary at times. Here's a direct quote from the book \\"It's an inherent trait in the national zeitgeist. Whether we realise it or not, even the most indefatigable Luddite can't deny our country's technoprowess\\". Wuh-what? Almost everyone in the book talks like this.<br />- Bogged down in war technicalities and military jargon. Feels like I'm reading an encyclopedia.<br />- Interchanges really interesting stories, with your typical dry, boring, war hero account. This was a constant source of frustration for me.<br /><br />Overall thoughts<br /><br />I don't think I would recommend this book to people who loved the movie. Only extreme zombie enthusiasts (like me) who want to know everything and anything about the zombies would probably sit through the hard slog that this book has to offer. But hey, it's a New York Times Bestseller, so what do I know.<br /><br />I think the scope and global view of the zombie apocalypse definitely must be commended. No one has ever documented how the zombies came to attack the world around us and what happened post war, and the book title nails it on the head, with most zombie entertainment featuring a small group of survivors. I think the book title captures the experience perfectly as \\"The oral history of the zombie war\\".<br /><br />Check out my blog, Happy Indulgence for more reviews!

0670022411|2.0|I am an eclectic reader and enjoy all genres. This is yet another vampire book in a sea of vampire romances out there, many I have enjoyed. Unfortunately this one is terrible. The book is dull and although I never abandon a book unfinished I seriously considered it this time.<br />The book is tedious and ostentatious in its attempts at snobbery. It spends much of it time describing tea and wine drinking or horse riding. The writing appears desperate in its attempt to impress us with the characters' class and sophistication by constantly digging into these irrelevant details. As for it being historic, there is nothing more to that than constant name dropping of famous people and places. The ultra perfect hero vampire has inexplicably known every important person in history and been at every important world event but none of these are gone into, just listed briefly like reciting a list of honors.<br />The characters are flat. They are too perfect. She is obviously the MOST powerful witch unlike any other history has known. He is the MOST handsome, smart and accomplished vampire.  Like every other story they are in love and everyone else in the world has a problem with it.<br />Despite the pretentiousness of the writing, the lack of actual historical interest in the book and the uninspired characters the real tragedy is the lack of plot. NOTHING happens. This book is perhaps used to set up future novels but who wants to read a slow moving, over pompous set up for nearly 600 pages?<br />Don't waste your time with this one when there are so many out there like this but with more to offer. Unless you have trouble falling asleep and even then counting sheep might be less boring.
B006YC74E8|5.0|With this app you can fix any picture you take. This app is awesome. It's way easy to use. Very self explanatory. You should definitely download it!!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|Well, it's out. As promised. The Master tapes weren't improved upon, but it was remixed. All I can say is,\\" Well done.\\"  I really did, on some level, like the distortion of the original; it had that \\"wall of sound\\" effect. Geddy seemed to be singing loudly to combat the guitar and the individual notes were noticeable, but behind the ringing of the previous notes. I like it -- it is the most hard rock album Rush has done.  But,,,  on to the new remix:<br />  There is much more clarity. It, at times, sounds like the production on the album \\"Presto\\".  To my ear here are the differences:<br /><br />  1) Geddy's voice is very audible, clear, but not too up front.<br />  2) It's very easy to hear exactly what Alex is playing.<br />  3) The all important \\"Low end\\" of songs like Peaceable Kingdom<br />  and Earthshine has been maintained !!!<br />  4) It's not as loud as the original -- in a good way.<br /><br />  I have kept the original along with the remix in a double cd case because there are reasons to like both versions.<br /><br />  Thanks Rush  ---  for keeping the price at 9 dollars and for listening to the fans - but then again, they always have (while maintaining their musical vision / integrity)<br /><br />  --  Rediscover a great Rush album all over again.<br /><br />  PS -- the liner notes are identical to the old version
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enjoyed the characters and their circumstance in life. Story line seemed to make sudden stops and quick starts. Hope you enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! I really could not put it down.  Haven't read a John Grisham book in a very long time and I surely have missed his work.  Nicely done!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book as much as. When I was 12; lots of fun, suspense, surprises and very moving too..
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game! Wonderful little puzzle to make you think. This would be a good game for senior citizens in a retirement home.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love the game. Just want the bonus painting. Not much more to say. Got it as a faotd and it is good.
B00DZV15FU|5.0|The format was a little off putting, but it was a great novel. It drew me in and kept me rivited. I loved it.
B00F2LIV4E|3.0|First off, before I get all of the hate posts, let me say it: Yes, they are amazing musicians. Amazing, amazing, amazing. The things they can do and the speed and precision they can do it boggle the mind. They should be teaching the rest of the world how to play instruments...<br /><br />OK? So, I wish they were out teaching the world, rather than making these mediocre albums. Good music = emotion. It makes you feel something. Happy, sad, energy, drowsy, something. This album is elevator music. One song blends into the next, none of which FEEL like anybody in the studio liked, hated, or felt one way or another about any of the tracks. \\"Time to squirt out another album, so we can go on tour again and make the real money! Here ya go!\\"<br /><br />I feel like an old codger now, constantly asking bands to listen to their early stuff and really understand how they became popular in the first place. I don't want a band to just make the same songs over and over, but once you've lost the emotion (<cough cough> Metallica, Megadeth, etc. <cough cough>) the music suffers.<br /><br />Everybody wants to bash LaBrie. I like him, listen to some of his solo-ish stuff (Mullmuzzler, Elements of persuasion, etc.). It's pretty solid, better than the last several DT albums. So, quit bashing LaBrie! Just kidding, everybody is entitled to an opinion.<br /><br />Even still, I give it 3 stars, because their skills always shine through. But their songwriting lately, meh. I just wish I knew what to start listening to now, since most of the mighty have fallen. Oh, wait LaBrie's solo albums! (Static Impulse, Impermanent Resonance) MUCH better efforts, thanks LaBrie, great save.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|I built the system as follows:<br /><br />AMD A10-6800K<br />G.Skill RipJawZ 8GB at 2400mhz<br />500GB HDD<br />Asus A85X V-Pro<br />Logisys 575W PSU<br />Diablotek Predator Gaming Case<br />AM3+ Stock Air Cooler 140w TDP<br /><br />1st things 1st, for those not being able to install iGPU video drivers update your motherboard's bios to fully support this CPU, it will most likely support the CPU alone (not the iGPU) by default but it will probably not find the iGPU(that's what we want it to find! :D). Ok now that we got that out of the table let's continue with my review.<br /><br />After i built the system, installed windows blah  blah blah, i got to be honest i play games. I have another system with an old PhenomII X4 965BE OC'ed to 4GHz and a XFX HD7970 GHz Edition so yeah im used to a high end'ish kind of performance, now after installing everything needed, with my stock air cooler i saw i had no headroom for overclocking at all (Note: It's about 32*C degree average in my country) so the CPU gets pretty hot, i then went to bios to underclock and undervolt it to 3.8GHz and 800MHz (to protect my CPU) while i got my custom air cooler well it happens to be i had an old am3+ cooler laying around and i just had to try it, to my luck CPU temps went down 10*C degree on the CPU side and on the iGPU it went down 12*C degree. If you have an AM3+ Cooler put it in! it also allowed me to leave the CPU at 4.4GHz and the iGPU at 900MHz permanently without the AMD PowerNow! feature.<br /><br />Now performance wise, CPU performs well compared to my other daily use CPU the P2X4 browsing, watching videos, etc etc. The Phenom is slightly faster in other applications than the 6800k, while the 6800k beats the P2X4 in others ofc.<br /><br />Now gaming wise, the first game i had installed was League of Legends not a much demanding game at all but have in mind i was used to a HD7970 (which my brother is using now) so i started up the game to have my jaw dropped..., the game performs awesome with everything turned on at 1440x900res and v-sync off (since my monitor refreshes at 75Hz), i was expecting a lot less from reading reviews and watching people videos but to be honest this APU is strong, im pleased with it since this will become my main system, now another game i tried was: Rift (MMORPG) i got most settings in ultra/high/low/off combo textures highest, shadows on, filtering on, terrain distance off(no practical use rather than \\"beautify\\" the in-game ambient) v-sync off and edge smoothing anti-aliasing with those settings the game gets 50's fps outside of town, inside of town it averages at 35fps and in warfront which is i think a 25vs25 battle goes down to 20's when in a huge fight, the gaming performance for this game blew my mind since again i was not expecting this level of performance out of one chip. 3rd and last game i've tried (only 2 months old PC) is assassins creed 2 the APU just blows up the fps in this game getting 50+ fps with everything turned on (everything!). Can't wait to start a co-op campaign in torchlight 2 with my bro :).<br /><br />Most people say like \\"hey, save up and grab another CPU and discrete GPU\\" but for the level of performance im pleased im planning on getting a water cooler before Christmas and i will try to OC the CPU to 5GHz (which i've seen people with it) and possibly OC the iGPU to 1169MHz (Note: My memory clock is at 1200MHz due to the 2400MHz RAMs).<br /><br />To conclude im extremely pleased with my APU only CON i find is the stock cooler it cools down the CPU just right with the AMD PowerNow! feature while it throttles down i wish AMD would ship these with the am3+ cooler since it worked wonders on mine (delete custom air cooler from cart, add water cooler :D). That's my only con after that the APU performs as advertised had no problems with the packaging or anything else whatsoever.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to ask if you need any info just leave a comment :).<br /><br />Edit(October 3rd): CPU is now stable at 4.6GHz at 1.4v CPUvolt with the am3+ stock cooler, so yeah, use it if you have it!

B008Y212PI|4.0|fun graphics quick games new type of game for me but easy to learn really e joyed it. hope to find more like it. fun for all ages
B003XHLIUS|5.0|Again it was for my son.  I loved this.  I have looked everywhere for these and they have the best selection. I got some from some other stores and the packages were already open and some of the figurines actually fell apart.  These were sound and in mint condition.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|will love watching the rest of the season's and looking forward for when the newer season are available to watch
B00DS2GBJG|5.0|I've always liked LaBrie's vocals, ever since the first time I heard him on Dream Theater's Images and Words. While I mourn the loss of DT, since their last several albums have been painfully sub-par and emotionless, LeBrie's solo work easily fills the void. He knows how to make an enjoyable song, to add emotion and energy to take the listener on a journey, while maintaining his operatic style.<br /><br />Thank you very much Mr Labrie for giving me 21 years of great music. I realize you have to put up with DT's loss of emotion in their songwriting to collect a paycheck, and I forgive you, because you put out these stellar solo albums. Really, they should take your albums, paste a DT logo on them, and let the rest of the guys retire. Give them 5% of the proceeds to keep quiet and let them go do their boring Liquid Tension Experiment work... You keep the DT name and fan base, you deserve them more!<br /><br />This album is fantastic, no weak tracks.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!! It was a fun read to read in my free time which is after I go to bed
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is very addictive and relaxing.<br />I am on it for ages.<br />Love the sound of the breaking squares.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|This game is great. I gave it three stars because if you remove from device instead of just the carousel on the Kindle it will not save any of your results. You have to start all over. Which really sucks when you are on game 90 of 100.
B00594XOZU|1.0|If you are having an issue logging in then go to the Report An Issue hopefully they will fix it!
B008Y212PI|1.0|if i have to connect to Amazon server every time I want to use this app, not worth it. DRM licence should issue, then it's your app, Amazon wants to invade your privacy and count the number of times you use their faotd with so-called iinnocent internet access. don't buy, costs too much!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Yes I loved it, it is the best Thor movie yet, then agin it is the only Thor movie.  I hope the net one is just as good.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I rented it and forgot about it, and it expired. Entirely my mistake. but I hear it is quite good.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|The only reason I really for into The Maze Runner series was for a school book report.  Now that I have gotten to actually read and learn about it and want rushed, realized that James Dashner is a brilliant writer make another book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Jeez you busy for hours.it's addictive.I've only done the 5 x 5 so far.i don't like it that to unlock I have to go to Facebook or leave a review<br />.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Its Star Trex, it got to be good, know what I mean. I cant wait for the net one. They just need to fine a way to produce them faster.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Thank goodness for the hints. Once you understand how to play, this is an awesome game and brain challenger.  The pictures are beautiful. Lots of fun.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|This is a deceptively fun read.A book that can be easily read but that has also many layers and gives one a lot to think about.I really loved it.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Loved it.  This will definitely be one of those books I read several times.  These really are 10 things noone told me in school or after.<br />Steal Like An Artist<br />Don't Wait Until You Know Who You Are To Get Started  (this would have been nice years ago)<br />Write the Book You Want To Read<br />Use Your Hands<br />Side Projects and Hobbies Are Important<br />The Secret: Do Good Work and Share It With People<br />Geography Is No Longer Our Master<br />Be Nice. (The World is a Small Town)<br />Be Boring. (Its the Only Way to Get Work Done)<br />Creativity is Subtraction.<br /><br />In fact, reading those titles again makes me want to reread a few chapters!  I thought this book was inspirational and motivational!  Hard to come by for me!<br /><br />I have this book for Kindle Fire and I think it works great.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Slow, Boring, I'm sorry I spent the $4.99 to watch the great bore.  I really thought is was something different maybe you'll like it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It has very enjoyable and hope the rest in the series are as good. It had twists and lots of action.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Super show to bad it was stopped. one, two, three, four, five, six , seven, eight, nine, ten eleven twelve, thirteen. thank you
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I just could not really get in to this book. I truly tried.The writer was all over the place and it was just hard for me to keep up.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting and keeps you wanting to know on both story lines.  A part of history I hadn't read much about.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is a great product, however using on an Asus without the assistance of a mouse, I found it quite awkward and time consuming. I'm used to the full blown MS Professional on a PC so there is a learning curve. Some of the excel features weren't available and I rely HEAVILY on excel functionality. For basic run of the mill excel use I'm sure it will suit your needs. I gave up on the Asus as well as the excel docs to go
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome it is very fun and addictive. You must buy this :) it is the best game I have brought in ages!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My kids and I love this game.  It reminds me of the old school Mario.  Keeps the kids entertained, plus it was free.  Can't complain!
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Yes I do like it, then as good as it is to me it just had a little to many explosins too much fire in volved..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never cried so hard about a book. Ever. Such great quotes, however this book left me heartbroken. Read it.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read--every sentence is worth savoring, and the deep emotion had me bawling my eyes out. This is the kind of book that makes you question what matters most to you, and what it means to be alive.  It's perfect for all ages.  Anyone with a heart will love this book, even if it leaves them a little broken afterwards.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can't log in! I tried to create a new account but still says&quot; error please try again in a bit later&quot;

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would like to read Christians book.  It was very exciting to read his chapter I want to read more
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A fun pass-time. Keeps the old brain cells actve but doesn't require a lot of time and can be put away quickly. Have had trouble getting back to it.
0060899190|5.0|I love the Postsecret site, and the books are the perfect companion. I have them all and this one is my favorite.  It's a gorgeous work of art to look through, and the secrets stay with you long after reading it.  It also prompts self reflection and makes one ponder their own secrets.  A great gift for yourself or someone you love--highly recommended!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson again breaks the mold, merging the familiar with fantastic new ideas! Can't wait to see how this tale will play out.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, the author brought the characters together seamlessly and the book really just flowed and made for an easy enjoyable read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This ap is an enjoyable waste of time. I enjoy playing it on my down time as a busy parent.  looking forward to unlocking more games.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is really good. It seems you hooked and will want to keep playing for hours at a time. Glad I found it.
B0083IQFEG|5.0|she just has such a unique vibe man, glad i got this vinyl! play it constantly. ntm 2 singles on one vinyl!
B008JFUNYG|4.0|I've seen all the old Evil Dead movies, but it's good to see a remake surpass the originals.<br />The effects were a lot better in the remake and the make up was too.<br />Over all i'd say it's worth buying and adding to you collection.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|This was a great reminder that there is no magic formula.  There is only hard work and love of the craft.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I lost sleep over it.  Stayed up too  late to read &#34;just a little more&#34;.  Especially enjoyed the parallel between the children on the orphan train and those in foster care.  We would have a tendency to feel sorry for the children on the train sent to a stranger's home but we are still sending children into homes where they are starved, beaten and abused in too many instances.  I do want to read more on the subject.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game, but I am having difficulties with level 6 , could anyone explain to me how to figure it out. I can't figure out what numbers r needed to open elevator.
B004X80QNG|5.0|Loads contacts for you when you connect to email. Calendars are easier to use than others I've used. Like having everything in one place and I don't have to buy a calendar every year to put in my binder!
B008Y212PI|3.0|Not very much action. Did not take very long to beat. It was okay for passing the time at a football half time.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I really enjoy the cast, and I think that they are funny. I can not get enough of the show.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Hosseini has written a beautiful, humane book about a place that he loves but does not romanticize.  His books have done as much as anything to help me understand Afghanistan and the Afghan people.  His characters are finely drawn and elicit sympathy even when they are not lovable.  The Afghan setting presents a harsh but lovely land in the throes of change it did not seek but is happening anyway.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game! The humor of the minions keep the game entertaining and enjoyable! Great app for any age!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|When I just want to unwind I go here! Love the control of the Colors. Amazed at the patterns and pictures you can draw, so Cool!!!!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Nice ending as we got a clearer picture into why Christian Grey became the man he use to be and the man he is now.<br />I've got to say, I wasn't going to read it because of the sbsm subject matter, but once you get past the shock of it<br />you start seeing the many shades of Grey.  And you begin to see the E.L James not only wrote a book that dealt with abuse, love, forgiveness, and all the other emotions in a wow factor way, but the author also made you root for Grey and Anastasia.  A nice conclusion to a roller coaster ride of a story.  If you can get past the numerous sex scenes you'll enjoy the behind the scene action even more.  We all got some shades of grey in our lives.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Super fun, great way to pass time. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. Great game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was definitely a five star book, it had good word choice but it was said , even though it was sad,the author kept it interesting. Which is what I simply adore about this book,plus it had suspense, you never knew what was going to happen next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love Pinterest! Find all sorts of ideas from crafts to makeup! On this site daily, can't stop too addicting, new items to browse everyday.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game is a little bit of what I like to call \\"hardcore\\" science fiction. That means it went a little bit over my head with all the science and everything. I usually cannot read this type of book, because I simply cannot understand what I'm reading.<br /><br />However, I just could not bear to quit on Ender. I found myself feeling so sorry for him throughout his trials that I just had to make sure he was okay. And I'm glad I stuck it out, because now that I'm done with the book, I can look back at it and say that it is a well-written and mostly enjoyable story. Even if what they put Ender through did make me pretty uncomfortable in places. I know he's \\"just a character\\" but he felt so real, and that kind of makes Mr. Card a brilliant author in my eyes, because I love characters that jump off the page like that. And all the kids did, except Peter...but that was okay, because I kind of despised Peter.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this book to science fiction fans. Especially to people who are more into the genre than I am, and can read the more \\"hardcore\\" books. I'm already planning to read book 2, because I just have to know what happens next, so I guess that means this is really a brilliant book!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|always playing this game and its one of the best<br />the x box games are nothing to this game no matter what people say
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is awesome! I love the ring tones on it! It's loud enough to wake up my snoring roommate - which is awesome!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Just like the Blu-ray. great set list. it comes with a little booklet that have a few cool pictures. In the end ( no pun intended ) its worth triple its weight for the music.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these puzzles. They are easy to start but they get more difficult. The pictures are so bright,and pretty. Have fun. Great app that I got as a free app of the day.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a splendid book! The combination of story and pictures was wonderful. And they weren't really creepy like I was expecting. I thought they were lovely pictures, and that they really added to the story.<br /><br />I feel like I can't say too much about this book without giving things away, because the spoilers would start very early in the book. But I loved this book. It has an interesting premise, and is very well written.<br /><br />Something I feel like I should make a note of, since I've seen other reviewers comment negatively on it. I read this book on my Kindle, and found it to be suited just fine for the Kindle. Yes, there is a picture of a letter in the last part that has small letters, but as long as you have good eyes or good glasses, you should have no trouble reading it. All I had to do was hold my Kindle a little closer than usual.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book. It was entertaining and mysterious, and wonderful.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very cool game. Not so hard as to be frustrating. Not so easy as to be boring. I liked it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the graphics of this cute little game. The game play is most excellent and a real challenge. If you are looking for a challenge this is the game for you. If you are looking for something simple and easy to play you will be disappointed. Try it, it's a cute little game!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Dinged this one star for having to post a review to continue because am not a Facebook user.  Otherwise this has been a fun app!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I can't find word all I need is to find the word MESOAMERICA but they don't have it I hate this
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This cable works much better because it seem to be harder to wiggle around i like better and if you get a kindle fire then make sure you get this because the other cable does not stay in. It easily falls out. becuse of that you can not play with it while it is charging so definatly get the https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31QjhkoC2EL._SL160_SS140_.jpg one.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game. First time playing it, and can't seem to stop. Almost time to advance to a more difficult level.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed it.  All women will enjoy.  Ready for the next book. As soon as I can get out of the kindle
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fire Maple Games has always put out amazing games and products - this one is bar none, the best of their entire series - the graphics, and scenery are warm and inviting - you feel as though you are embarking on a mystical adventure filled with fantasy, puzzles, and more - the environments are nothing short of breathtaking, and really immerse you into the world of Mosaika.<br /><br />The puzzles are much more challenging this time around, and really make you think of your next step - the nice thing about this game is that you have a magnifying glass hint button, so anytime you are stuck, just tap the magnifier, and it tells you the next step - if there is a puzzle involved, you even have the choice of revealing the solution, or waiting to see if you can solve it yourself. That's a really nice touch to this game so that both rookies and hardcores to the series can enjoy this game.<br /><br />I finally completed the game last night, and loved the entire experience from beginning to end! Especially love the addition of animal characters in-game, and the evil Sorceress is a lovely addition as well! This game will blow you away with it's intricate puzzles, detailed animations, and breathtaking scenery!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun it's way better than temple run. I love minions!!!!!!!! Thank you sooooo very much!  Minions!!!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|At first I thought that it would not work. But... it totally works. I TOTALLY recommended this to anyone. Get it!!
B0069JBKHI|1.0|I wanted to like this product, but out first device failed an we ended up connected to a couple's baby monitor in France. After the lengthy return process, our second one showed up and worked great for a little while. Now, it will not boot up. Just sits there and flashes a blue light. We've tried every troubleshooting technique possible with no luck. How can a company make such low quality products for something as important as your child? If I can't get my money back, I really don't care anymore. This is the last time I consider a product from Withings. I just want something that works.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really enjoyed Season 3 and looking forward to Season 4. Captivating drama with excellent casting. Great character development. I highly recommend the entire series.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is a great show! Great comedic lines. I love the interactions between the roomates. I am hooked! Must watch this series starting with season 1.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|Great game overall. A bit pricy. Runs well on my fire hd. I recommend this game to any basketball fans or players out there.
B0055D3EFU|3.0|After reading some other reviews, I have to agree that this is very nearly a \\"Poltergeist\\" remake.  There are some variations (ie, being trapped via astral projection as opposed to being snatched by ghosts), but it is quite similar.<br /><br />One reviewer indicated he almost peed his pants watching this film.  Thankfully, that didn't happen to me (*grin*), although I will admit to some goose flesh at a couple of spots when the special effects were particularly creepy.  The film begins very slowly and then finally picks up the pace.  Once things got going, it was entertaining.  The main reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the very slow beginning and the ending.  I generally dislike movies that end without a happy resolution and without the bad guys getting their comeuppance.  In fact, I seriously hate that.  This movie has a similar type of ending, which I found very annoying.  I know it's pat, but I just prefer the tidy resolution where everything is right with the world again.<br /><br />***Potential Spoiler Alert***<br />I also found myself really detesting the father in the movie, as he seemed like a complete idiot.  I mean, why go to all of the trouble to astrally project himself and fist-fight a ghost (seriously?) in order to find his lost son, only to stupidly separate from said son and squander valuable time feebly screaming at a ghost in the mirror??  And before astrally projecting, the dad was resoundingly warned NOT to draw attention to himself.  Yet, the second he reaches The Further, he meanders all over the place stupidly and repeatedly yelling \\"HELLO?!\\" as loudly as possible.  That's about as subtle as driving your car on the sidewalk.  So by the end of the movie, I was ready to thrash the father myself.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a terrible film or the stupidest movie I've ever seen, as some reviewers have stated.  It's entertaining for a one-time viewing, but probably isn't something I'll ever watch again.<br /><br />PARENT ALERT: As for the rating (PG-13), it does have some pretty scary moments that I wouldn't want my kids to watch, as well as some swearing--most notably one F-bomb, along with several religious exclamations.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|No better keyboard anywhere. Learns to predict what words you prefer from Facebook, Twitter, email, and text messages. Multiple themes available to customize your experience.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Developers have made this free game not so free.  Use to be able to win occasionally but now I play 1 or  2 rounds and I'm out of credits.  Sure I could buy more but I shouldn't have to for a free game.  I feel that there are ways they could loosen up the winnings without breaking the bank.  It's a very fun game if you can win sometimes.  Great themes ideas just gets Boring when your always out of credits.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|to the kindle fire users!!!! you CAN shut the plane off. go to the settings and it will say to add it or not. hit it once to shut it off. I have a kindle fire and it works fine, I just don't play that one!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Gave this as a Christmas gift to my nieces. They love it! Wish I had gotten a chance to watch it myself. Maybe one day.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Yes, this is a big book and it took an understandable plunge that almost did me in. I stopped. Wrote a one star review..it would have been less if I could have! and then I picked it up again and never put it down till I reached the end. I liked the people. Thats important if You are going to keep turning pages rapidly..edge of your seat kind of thing!
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I haven't had any issues with this adapter.  It worked the first time I used it, it's compact, and gives me pretty good speed on a gigabit network.  I travel a lot and it definitely feels like it will hold up to the abuse of travel.
B008Y212PI|4.0|So far pretty good. I have been playing for well over  the time that I thought. I got completely lost in the game. Great time passer when you have nothing else to do. And it was the FAOTD so even better. One of the few app games that I'll actually keep from FAOTD.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|If you like the X-Men series, you'll love this movie.  It gives Wolverine's background and is well played.  The movie itself is just what we wanted, single disc, no special features.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This app is awesome! I couldn't put it down. The tutorial is very helpful and the actions are quite intuitive. I only wish there were more screens available!
B008Y212PI|5.0|My first time with these kind of puzzles and so far I'm enjoying them. I will now try the harder ones and hope to enjoy solving them just as much.
B008478VE8|5.0|If you have not read this yet, you need to do so. One can really feel the passion Darwin had for his theory, which makes it a fascinating read. I felt inspired as I read it and could not put it down. Very enlightening, but I would encourage one to take one's time and really chew on everything Darwin had to say.

B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Cath and her twin sister Wren go off to the same college. And while Cath thought they would room together, Wren has other plans. Both Simon Snow fans, Wren is ready to explore the world in college, while Cath still loves to write fan fiction of Simon Snow. But as college, and new experiences, are around every corner, will Cath be able to change and explore her new world, and herself?<br /><br />Well, Ms. Rowell, you've done it again. I loved Eleanor & Park so I did have high expectations for this new book of yours Fangirl. And it did not disappoint. The story takes place during freshman year at college. Wren and Cath are so used to being together that Cath is totally shocked when Wren doesn't want to room with her and wants to explore new friends and new experiences. Cath rooms with Reagan, a harsh yet loyal friend who gently coaxes Cath out of her shell. Throw in her is he or isn't he semi-boyfriend Levi, and Cath can't get away from college life, and all of the new things thrust at her.<br /><br />I loved Cath. I loved her nerdy personality, her shy and socially awkward behavior, and her love of Simon Snow. I love that the book is YA and New Adult, taking place during that time when everything is happening and it can sometimes just be too much. A lot of New Adult out there are big, heavy, complicated romance stories with a lot of sex, which is all well and fine. But I really liked how gentle and sweet this story is, the slow unfolding of an awkward teenager and her first love. It's a best friend story, an identity story, a fan/nerd story. Cath has this wonderfully organic journey through the book and explores new things, but never does she compromise herself.<br /><br />Levi is a funny guy. It was really easy to picture him, with his hands running through his hair. (Though, yes, I get it. He runs his hands through his hair. A lot. The one thing that irked me was how many times it was described.) His patience and sense of humor make him shine and  he's not withoutfault.<br /><br />Reagan is a great roommate and friend. I liked her personality in compared to Cath's. She's blunt, honest and opinionated without being a bully or mean. I love how different they are but how they become friends. It's reminds me of my college experiences.<br /><br />And Wren, the twin, who is dealing with everything the best way she knows how. I'm not going to spoil anything but I liked Wren's journey through the book too.<br /><br />I also really loved their relationship with their Dad. Dad can be a little off balance sometimes, and there are some really warm and beautiful moments between Cath and her Dad that stand out in the book. While their mom is no longer in the picture, at least as far as Cath is concerned, it's really refreshing to see a loving relationship between parent and child.<br /><br />Overall, Fangirl is a wonderfully tender tale of finding yourself in college and the first experiences along the way.<br /><br />Find more reviews at TheWindyPages dot com
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|With extensions on chrome, it is really flawless. Uses TV volume.<br />Netflix, you tube are naturals. Other tabs show flawlessly too.<br />Good product. Well priced.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I haven't read much of Mr. King's newer works since the conclusion of the Dark Tower. I started to feel like the stories that I enjoyed and that grabbed me by the throat so well got knocked out of him by that van back in '99.<br /><br />I waffled over buying this story, but I'm glad I risked it. I started it yesterday and last night I dreamed about how I could save Abra all night. I'd wake up to turn over and realize I was problem solving for her. Wake a little while later and was still at bat for her. When I finally got up with the alarm, my psyche was STILL agitating over this fictional girl and Dan Torrence.<br /><br />I finished it tonight. It didn't frighten me, but it was a very well told story. I appreciated the saturation of the recovery/AA themes in the book, because it's true, we are only as sick as our secrets. I enjoyed getting to know the man that Danny became, even when he was at his wretched worst. The story didn't scare me like the Shining did. I remember RE-READING it and still being frightened to turn my back to the window or the door in my room. I read hundreds of pages of that book flat on my back because I was afraid to leave my back exposed to something I couldn't see. This book certainly had its fill of thrills and chills, but I didn't get scared to turn my back to the door. I enjoyed the ride all the same.
B00E0G5U4G|4.0|I'm not going to write a long review of each song, etc. but just wanted to voice my opinion, and make one point. First of all the album is great. Solid four stars, and worth the wait. I don't feel like they are breaking any new ground here, as they did in the late 80's, and early 90's, so I wouldn't give it five stars. Reek, Symphonies, Necroticism, and Heartwork all brought something to the table that had never been done before, Surgical Steel doesn't bring anything new, but is still a very solid release. Back in their prime, Carcass was setting the bar for everyone else, and it is nice to see that they can still perform at that level. In a way it feels like this album should have come out two years after Heartwork. It really fits that era.<br /><br />Now the point that I wanted to make. So far, what I read, and hear from a lot of people is how bad they expected this album to be after such a long break, and now they are blown away by how good it is. Well, I agree that this is a great album, but I think the reason it is getting so many five star reviews is because people are so surprised that it doesn't stink. I think the expectations were so low for Surgical Steel that when everyone finally heard it, and it was great, it floored them into five star reviews. This is not a five star album. As I said before, there is nothing new here, but that is okay because these are good songs, the right length, played well, and better than almost everything else out there right now. I don't feel like this album will be the classic that Necroticism, or Heartwork is. I don't mention Swansong here because it was admittedly just a quick run together of songs to fulfill a contract, and it shows. If I had to rank all of their albums in order from best to worst it would be Necroticism, Heartwork, Surgical Steel, Symphonies, Reek, Swansong. The Tools of the Trade EP is pretty strong too.<br /><br />Anyway, pick this up. It is definitely worth it. A fantastic release by these legends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|this is by far one of the best games out there!  It is well worth the purchase.  If you are into mystery puzzles you wont be dusappointed.  Everything about The Room is awesome.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Enjoyed this novel even though I usually would prefer something more positive.  Easy to relate childhood memories<br />that  seem to follow
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|The movie itself was great! The problem however was with the products inside. There was no 3D glasses for watching the 3D movie at all. The digital copy code was already accessed and paramount would not give me a replacement code.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|As you can guess from the title, this is the book about how underdogs break the rules and defeat the privileged. As usual, Gladwell introduced many interesting examples to show his points.<br /><br />The story I liked best was the one about the middle school girl basketball team coached by an Indian businessman Vivek Ranadivé. Ranadivé knew nothing about basketball and his team was made up with short nerdy girls. But he managed to bring his team to the national championship. Gladwell explained the strategies Ranadivé used which lead his team to unthinkable victories. They are interesting enough, but there must be more which contribute to Ranadivé's remarkable achievement. I wish Gladwell went deeper than this.<br /><br />In his last book [[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]], Gladwell introduced \\"the 10,000hr rule\\" as \\"a key in success\\". I thought it was an overly simplified conclusion, and I strongly disagreed with it. I felt the same way about this DAVID AND GOLIATH. It could be even harmful if you take his conclusions as the definite truth.<br /><br />Having said that, this is an encouraging book for underdogs who have dyslexia or hard childhood. Gladwell is a great story teller, and I always admire and enjoy his writing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I miss Enzo  Such a good story.  Stopped many times just  to hug my two collies. Didn't want it to end
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love this game but I really hate the last 20 seconds or balls because it runs down so fast you do not have time to mark the number let alone hit bingo. It robs you of your bongos. This is why I don't play it as much as use to. It is also hard to get the chest to complete the rooms.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was great! Well written, very interesting and had basis in real life so it was easy to relate to!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I get lost in this game and time goes by without notice.  Good thing I have to charge the battery!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The cast works wonderful together.  John Malkovich is great and Helen Mirren, as always, is absolutely fantastic.  This would make a great TV series if it would keep the movie cast.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|I saw this movie when it originally came out and since the 2nd came out recently, I decided to recap and watch it again.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I had never seen this movie before and thought it was very funny.  It was even better to be able to see it in high definition.  I highly recommend it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|If you're wondering about the title, try playing this while smoking a cigarette and you'll get the idea.  It will also reduce any eating you may be tempted to do.  This game requires quick wits and hand-eye coordination.  And of course you've just got to \\"try it just one more time.\\"  So be warned!! You'll end up having a nicotine fit and wonder why your stomach thinks your throat has been cut. And anyone else depending on you for food, drink, or any other life sustaining behavior suffering from neglect.<br /><br />It should come with a warning:  This Game is Highly Addictive and should be on the same drug class schedule as cocaine.
B007THA4FI|3.0|DYSFUNCTIONAL TOWN, DYSFUNCTIONAL PEOPLE, WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR. SHE DID WRITE IT WELL HAVEN BEEN TO ENGLAND MANY TIMES I FELT I WAS BACK THERE AGAIN.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|We watched this movie with pretty low expectations and were not let down. Overall action was good, decent story (sadly its the same story line as sooooo many other movies) no new twist. Definitely a renter
B00873GRU4|5.0|Once every few years you pick up a book and read an amazing story. This is one of those times. Wool makes you feel like you are part of their world. Hugh Howey you are truly an amazing story teller.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|This is one of the classic albums that he ever produced. Every song is great and will bring back memorys. Whats even better is you get 2 albums (disc) for the price of one. Lots of music.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I enjoy G5 games, but was left a little wanting with this one. For some of the minigames, the instructions weren't clear and some scenes were very dark making it hard to find some items.  I was also hoping for a slightly longer game for the price.  The graphics and story weren't bad.
0425263908|5.0|I ordered this for my wife and she loved it, she really loves to read series and i she loved this one because shell read it in like 3 days, so i would say she like it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game functions well, crashed a couple times, but graphics are great and simple gameplay. Wish it was easier to earn coins.
B005ES0ZDU|5.0|These are really comfortable. I like just being able to slip them on and off. Even though I know better I find myself wearing them when I am not working. Sorry, I just like the comfort. If you work on your feet and your workplace allows them, you should try them.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a fun little game.  Semi challenging, with multiple difficulty levels.  Let's hope they add more pictures, because once you're done, it's not as fun to redo puzzles.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Weapons are well made yet again, love the ww2 classics, update more! very great price for all of the content.
1594489505|5.0|My emotions were all over the place!  What a powerful, eye-opening experience to live the lives of these two heroic women!  I have to say, however, that it was a heavy.  I found myself carrying around hostility for hours after I'd done a bit of reading.  Parts of it were hard for me to read because it was so tragic.  Overall outcome:  I feel so fortunate to have been born in a time and place where women are respected and valued, and empathy for the women of Afghanistan who have endured so much tragedy and hardship.
B00COQKDT6|4.0|The album is great the new sound is awesome. The CD came in perfectly safe and was what I was looking forward to, I would gladly buy more CDs from the company as well as the band.
B008AVXGA2|5.0|Children's books have changed a great deal from when I was a kid. Although there are a ton of great books out there today, sometimes I feel as if the literature has been removed from Children's lit. That is one of the biggest reasons why I fell in love with \\"FireBird\\".<br /><br />The fairy tales are back as two children, Alex and Kate, become lost in a magical realm. We journey along with them as they fight to find their way back home.<br /><br />Check this one out!
B005ETA5K2|4.0|These alpha adapters are quite good for how much they cost. I got this one to replace my AWUS036H which eventually stopped working. First thing I noticed was if I used it for long periods of time it got really hot.  After reading up on the product on various nerdy tech blogs I found out that ultimately the device had burned it's self out. I learned that it is best if you plug this device into an external USB port with an alternate power source to keep it from doing that again.  However I got this one because they said it was a new release and more powerful, maybe it's different on various computers but it actually seems less powerful then the standard AWUS036H.  On a connection that got only %30 signal with my laptops standard adapter the AWUS036H boosted it anywhere from %70 to %85 signal, this one only gets me %65 max. None the less it's still strong enough to stream netflix and allows me to complete my other tasks so I'll give it a four star rating.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great for passing time in Queues and on the train. Could do with more energy before you have to buy!
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I do not generally like Zombie Movies but I enjoyed this one very much.  It had more elements of a good sci-fi movie than a gory horror flick.  It was fast paced with incredible special effects, along with good acting & good story line.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Music and lyrics that will remind you of Bob Dylan.  I like both of Rodriguez's albums.  Hard to believe he was missed by the U.S. mainstream
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|I am a fan of Brandon Sandersons books and this one is also very good.  The only reason for not giving this 5 stars is I don't really feel it had the same character development as his other books and felt a bit rushed. Given that it's target audience is YA, I can understand why it was written in this way and if I was 15 years younger it probably would have received the extra star. Having said that, it probably would loose another star if I was 15 years older than I am now!<br /><br />The main character seemed to me to be a bit mature given he was meant to be 18 years old. The way he spoke and the confidence he expressed when he joined the Reckoners didn't seem that realistic to me.  However, despite this, the book has great action scenes, a great premise and I am looking forward to reading Firefight when it comes out.

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|And what a surprise. Music, released 2013, sounding like time travelling through multiple generations.<br />Very recommendable. Cheesy to say the least, yet irresistible in this.<br /><br />If you grew up throughout the 70's, 80's, 90's, even 2000's, you can take something away from this - and you don't even need to be ashamed, it's socially acceptable again to listen to this - this - this - .... well, really lacking the words.<br /><br />Respect to Daft Punk, a brave statement where everyone else is lost in the XXVII'th iteration of Garage or whatever derived styles. Or EDM (funny how Daft Punk claimed never even having heard that term).<br /><br />And, contrary to most out there, it grows on you while listening again and again.
B00097DX3U|5.0|OUT OF EXILE, AUDIOSLAVE ´s 2nd album is by far their best.....Their debut is powerful, and i really like REVELATIONS....but OUT OF EXILE shows a collection of HEAVY, DARK, INSPIRED HEAVY METAL ROCK songs like BE YOURSELF, DROWN ME SLOWLY, YOUR TIME HAS COME and HEAVEN´s DEAD......Cornell shines here, and Morello and cia are such a AMAZING band!!!!!!!WELL DONE, AUDIOSLAVE!!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUR10|2.0|del Toro's visual imagination is present in Pacific Rim, but his storytelling definitely is not.  At least the first half of the film is made up of voice over narratives, time jumps, and flashbacks.  It doesn't have a story so much as a vast sea of clumsy exposition, meant to establish extremely rote character arcs while instructing the audience on what everything is.  Charlie Hunnam's and Rinko Kinkuchi's characters both must overcome a lame contrived trauma beset on them by the Kaiju, giant CGI aliens/sea monsters.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is clunky when the characters talk to one another as well.  The actors must constantly fight del Toro's scifi mumbo jumbo to try to convey humanity.  Overall, Pacific Rim leaves the impression that its ideas were way to big for one movie, or simply not thought through.
B009G41CG2|4.0|For a person new to Mahjong, I was very pleased to use this system.  It was fun, kept my interest and did not frustrate me as other Mahjong puzzles have.
B005FVNIW6|3.0|I may have had my hopes raised because this book was so well received, but it turned out to be not much more than an easy read.<br /><br />Card writes plainly enough and pares everything back to what's essential, and that's commendable. However, at times the descriptions of the simulated games left me confused as to what was happening.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of the book held my interest. After that, though, I lost interest and the end couldn't come soon enough.
B00006RU5B|5.0|AUDIOSLAVE´s debut is a great HEAVY ROCK album with the brilliant combo of Chris Cornell and the legendary RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE sound....I really like SOUNDGARDEN and RAGE, so this is just a powerful mix of Cornell´s roars, screams and lyrics with the FUNK METAL punch of Morello and cia. There´s many gens like LIKE A STONE, COCHISE, SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE, I AM THE HIGHWAY and GASOLINE......Man, if you like HEAVY ROCK, check AUDIOSLAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1250012570|5.0|Excellent book. I think it's supposed to be a young adult novel, but I (a full fledged adult) thoroughly enjoyed it. I listened to the recorded version. Highly recommend.

B000IJ79UW|4.0|Superman (1978) Bowling for Movies Score: 249.375 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />Superman - we own the DVD of this film which came as part of a combo pack including the other 3 movies spanning the 1970's and 1980's (I will leave a combined Bowling for Movies score here ([[ASIN:B001DJLD2G 4 Film Favorites: Superman (Superman II: Special Edition, Superman III: Deluxe Edition, Superman IV: Deluxe Edition, Superman, The Movie: Special Edition)]]) when I have them all scored!)<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />This mild-mannered film was a 70's box office smash hit.  Although the mythos of Superman had been well established via comic book and television, never before had the caped crusader taken to the big screen like this - right there on screen, flying faster than a speeding bullet SUPERMAN (ok, I was 7 when the movie came out and you might be able to tell - I fell in love with this franchise).<br /><br />When bureaucratic stupidity dooms the citizens of Krypton to, er - doom.  Jor-El, an eminent scientist, warns the rulers of the planet that death is coming for dinner but he is looking for love in all the wrong places and is forced to send his only infant son, Kal-El, into a space capsule to save his life (why they didn't just all jump in a Super Family version of the Family Truckster I can't say) but off to the strange planet Earth Kal-El (Kal to his friends) goes.  Along the way Jor-El has seen to his son's education and needs until BOOM, Kal-El crash lands on Earth and in near proximity to the elderly couple, Jonathan (Jon to his friends) and Martha Kent, who decide to take him in and raise Kal-El as their own.  Fun and frolic ensue, Kal-El is renamed Clark and is off to become a mega-nerd in high school and wham bam, suddenly Clark is off to the big city where he adopts the lifestyle of a timid newspaper reporter (remember those?)  He falls in love with a co-worker (guess he didn't get the memo about sexual harassment in the workplace), and fights crime for fun in some righteously cool pajamas... oh, did I mention the fortress of solitude among the arctic ocean ice (remember when there was ice at the poles?)  Enter a diabolical plan by the super villain Lex Luther to have California fall into the Pacific to increase property values in Nevada and Arizona (remember when California had property value?)  Whew - long story short - Superman is here to save the day, Lois (Clark's sexy co-worker) gets squished, and Kal-El breaks the only real rule he's subject to, mainly that of staying out of human affairs - he reverses the direction of the Earth's spin, effectively turning back time, and saving Lois (presumably so she could die of lung cancer at a later date - Lois, didn't you hear?  Smoking stinks and will kill you!).  Oh, and before all that happened, we were treated to a trial of some criminals on Krypton (literally our first encounter with Kryptonians) and they are convicted and sent into space in a giant wall mirror... never to be seen again (except in the next movie which the movie makers seemed pretty sure was going to happen, apparently).<br /><br />Good Golly - what went right!<br />The movie can only be described as super - the story was spot on, the special effects were spectacular (pre-CGI days people WOW), Christopher Reeve was Superman (like in my mind forever), the musical score was infectious (I can still hear the theme running in a loop in my head), the villains were villainous... dude - it was simply Super, heck, I'd even add a Duper in there - and talk about tidy whities, I don't know what kind of bleach Mrs. Superman uses but the clothes on Krypton were incredible!<br /><br />What went wrong!<br />Ok, the pace was a little slow, the story was a little long, the plot development was kind of silly... can I be Frank?  Ok, from now until the end of the review, you can just call me Frank.  I loved the movie.  The Bowling for Movie score above 200 makes this one heck of a great movie and these little trivial \\"problems\\" (and problems is too big of a word, like, prob would be better because it was tiny)... these probs only slightly detract from the Super experience - I have only one word of advice - bring POPCORN.<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

B005MJFA2W|5.0|This book will change your thinking. It starts simply with almost primitive to be specified questions and betting a few dollars. From this develops a theory of the mind.<br />The reader is involved in this process, as he has to answer questions, for example, or can opt for betting. He decides almost exactly like the majority of respondents,and that is often wrong. In this way our mind is analyzed in its course and located in two planes. System 1 and System 2.<br />System 1 is the intuitive, spontaneous system, which decides very quickly without thinking and without analyzing the situation. It decides spontaneously, as they say intuitively from the gut. This system governs our daily lives. Without it we could not live. For if we should endeavor in every decision, the analytical, exhausting, deeply thoughtful System 2, we would get bogged down and deplete us. We could not really put our lives on the line. Everyone knows that if he, for example, is driving a car on a straight road and suddenly finds that he just went way too without even being aware of it in detail. System 1 has controlled.<br />Everyone knows, however, the myth of the \\"first impression\\" of a person, who is said to be the right one. This first impression based solely on one or two features of the new and unknown person is without value because it says nothing about hundreds of other traits. A few features are considered for all. A system 1 error, we all succumb to daily, unconsciously.<br /><br />But, this system 1 is 98% absolutely right and is essential for daily life. However, it is prone to error as shown above and there are always the same typical, fatal errors. These typical errors (not more than 10 at all)reveals the author. They can hurt us significantly e.g. decisions on savings plans, retirement, investments, property management, expensive purchases, choice of business partners, entering into relationships, etc.<br />The theory comes to the economy, to sophisticated negotiating tactics, to (also wrong) decisions in the economy, to politics anyway. Details can not be reported. For it is all too extensive but overall amazing and shockingly easy.<br /><br />These mistakes we all make, almost without exception, are made aware to the reader. Some of them you have already guessed, but here it is measured and demonstrated. No doubt, the reader thinks critically after reading this book, he analyzes more, he tries to consult statistics and logic, even if it is stressful. Anyway, he now knows the thinking traps and may try to avoid them.<br /><br />An excellent summery of Prof. Kahnemanns results of research.Amusing and very instruktiv.lso wrong) decisions in the economy, to politics anyway.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Highly addictive. Easy to figure out and play. Would recommend to start with the five by five game first though. Love puzzle games.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It only got because it was the FAOTD and I'm SO glad I did! It works really well for me. It makes editing pictures WAY funner. I especially love the meme making thingies. It's so cool and it works beautifully. If you ever get the chance, you should think about getting it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. I have never tried these type of games before but they are great. the tutorial is very helpful.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This story was brought to me by book club.  I thought at first it was a little odd for the title until I started to understand the character.  She became so complex and you love the main character through her flaws.  At some points I was afraid to put the book down needing to know that all were alright before I could close my eyes to sleep.  Definitely recommend this one!

B0039208JE|4.0|I love Batman and I've watched all of the cartoons and movies of this guy.  In fact, Batman was the one thing better than watching Walt Disney movies when I was growing up.  I just love them all!  Well, except for \\"Batman & Robin\\", which was one of the horrible movies ever made.  I also love the Christopher Nolan \\"Dark Knight Trilogy\\", which is the franchise ever made for Batman himself.  But we're not talking about Nolan's or Joel Schumacher version.  Lets get right to Tim Burton and his own version known as \\"Batman\\"!<br /><br />Everyone knows who Tim Burton is.  This is the type of guy who can take the most bad idea in the world and turn it something awesome and somewhat new.  With that said, we can tell that he was the perfect director for Batman back when it was getting made.  Some of you might be disappointed with how things turned out with \\"Batman Returns\\", but in truth, the sequel still paid-off and gave us enjoyable moments with Batman himself.  So in truth, Burton may make really dark moments in a movie, even a little too much, but he still manages to make the development worth it in the end.<br /><br />When I first watched this movie, I was a little kid and I would just be fascinated with the world of Batman and how the turn of events were playing out.  I got very excited for every moment and just enjoy everything there was about the movie.  It had really dark moments and I did have nightmares afterwards, but they were worth it.  But as I look back on it now, I still love and enjoy the movie, but not as much when I was little.<br /><br />Okay, off to review.  I actually loved Michael Keaton's performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  It was like I was seeing two different people, but at the same time, knowing that they were one and the same.  His acting as Batman made every scene just amazing to watch and just get excited for what he was going to do to the bad guys.  Even his performance as Bruce was good as well.  But there were times when I felt that we didn't get enough screen-time with Bruce or Batman.  But this movie was made a long time ago and was one of the first live-action films of Batman ever made, so it can be forgiven.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson was a great Joker.  He made me laugh at times whenever he made a joke that was worth laughing over.  And there were times when I was scared of the guy.  I also love how the movie tells about his transformation into the joker and also has references to his alter-ego, with the purple suit and the joker cards.  We do get to see what the Joker's life was like before he went \\"nuts-o and crazy\\".  But the way how Jack plays the Joker before his transformation wasn't really as good as I hoped.  He was good, but not all that interesting.  But when the Joker remerges after falling into come chemicals and plastic surgery to change his face, that is when Jack brings out the real acting of the Joker.  I mean, he literally goes from laughing to being serious in a matter of seconds.  Not to mention that he just \\"enjoys\\" killing and making jokes about it as well.  This is a villain who is all about chaos and destruction.  Trust me, Jack Nicholson brings out the Joker just the way how the character is supposed to.<br /><br />I also loved the performance of Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale.  I thought she really did well as the character and allowed us to like her.  She brings out the whole \\"visionary\\" of Vicki and also manages to bring out something new as well.  In a way, I was glad that Vicki was used as the love interest of Bruce Wayne himself and that she learns his secret later on in the movie.  Another thing is that Basinger really brings Vicki's emotions to life and also her strong-will too.  She understands why Bruce does what he needs to do and takes his secret very well.  In a way, it makes her more hot and sexy for that.<br /><br />The movie itself was well put together and allowed us to just enjoy everything about it.  The graphics are not exactly as they are today, but they are still nice and well-done.  Some really do a nice job at portraying Gotham City.  The atmosphere of the movie is dark and exciting.  The characters are interesting.  The villains are awesome.  And the design of the costumes, the adventure, and the emotional moments are amazing.<br /><br />As I look back on it now, I realize that there are a few things that could have done better and that I have moved on from this movie.  But then again, all of those things that I now found to be problems for the movie, were actually corrected in Christopher Nolan's version of Batman.  The backstory of Bruce's beginning as Batman is told very well.  The death of his parents is way more emotional.  The storyline was made more darker.  Other villains were done way better, like Heath Ledger as the Joker for example.  Not to mention that the franchise was tied up really well.  So, as I realize that now, \\"Batman\\" is a great film and one of Tim Burton's great movies.  It was dark (in its own way) and a great beginning for Batman himself.<br /><br />Is it worth it?  The answer is absolutely \\"yes\\"!  This is a movie worth buying.  You will enjoy every moment of it and just feel great afterwards.  Don't worry about the story.  Don't worry about anything.  Just enjoy the movie and have fun watching what Tim Burton and many other people have created for us.  Besides, without Tim Burton and this wonderfully made movie, we wouldn't have all of these great installments that we have today.re still nice and well-done.

B0001I55OC|3.0|I loved reading the book and when I realized that they made a movie, well of course - I had to see it.  I read some of the reviews by others first and was a little discourged in what I might be getting but I ordered it anyway.  Yeah, it kind of got lazy and concentrated on the hack and burn and not enough on the character building.  It was okay and I will probably watch it again sometime.  But it's not so great that I would buy it for Christmas gifts - that's for sure.

B00406UK7S|5.0|Centurion is a great story of survival. The film takes place in 117 CE, when Hadrian had just become emperor. The Roman Empire was at it furthest extent but would soon contract as the new emperor would soon abandon some newly won provinces and seek to find defendable borders.  The film is set in northern Britain, which the Romans are trying to gain control over, being opposed by the elusive Picts.  The problem that the British tribes presented to the Romans was one of deep concern to Hadrian. The emperor visited Britain in 122 CE, bringing with him the new Sixth legion. Emergency troops were sent to the island and, of course, Hadrian's ultimate solution was to build the wall to separate the lawless north from the settled portion.<br /> Michael Fassbinder (as Quintus Dias, the Centurion of the title) turns in a remarkable heroic performance. Dias is the only survivor when the Picts overrun his garrison. He is taken in by the Ninth Legion, commanded by General Virilus (Dominic West) who inspires his men with complete devotion. Virilus is charged by the Roman governor to wipe out the Picts following a mute Pict woman named Etain (demonically played by Olga Kurylenko). Although Virilus does not trust the mysterious Etain, he follows his orders. In the deep woods, Etain betrays the Romans to her countrymen, who slaughter the legion taking Virilus prisoner. The survivors of the massacre, led by Dias, must make their way back to a garrison all the while being tracked by Etain, who is bent on revenge for the atrocities committed by the Romans.<br /><br />There has been a lot of criticism of the film as being too violent but I would say that Gladiator was a more violent film. To make the battle scenes close to reality, there needs to be a lot of horrific and bloody death scenes, but they are not carried to an extreme.  The massacre of the Ninth Legion is well staged and reminded me of the historical Teutoburg Woods massacre of three legions in the reign of Augustus. The filmproduction is very good with the gear and soldier uniforms reflecting the real ones closely enough and the Picts are shown as a noble people in spite of their savagery.  Best of all, is the cinematography with the craggy and forbidding Scottish landscape.<br /><br />Fassbinder is well supported by Olga Kurylenko and Dominic West who are fabulous in their roles.  I liked that the story does not take sides, showing one as irredeemably evil; and does not gloss over the crimes an army of occupation commits.  The Romans are responsible for their own demise as they created a vengeful Etain through a brutal act.  The center of the story is the will to survive, and that makes Centurion a film worth watching.

0316204366|4.0|If you were taught that the point of David and Goliath was how a small but determined boy, David, managed to miraculously beat a much stronger giant, Goliath, author Malcolm Gladwell suggests  that you might be missing a key point. Instead, as he asserts, many \\"giants\\" who seem powerful might not be nearly as strong or invulnerable as they appear.<br /><br /> And in the particular instance of David and Goliath, Gladwell describes the warriors of the time and notes that David was probably an accomplished projectile warrior, one who knew how to handle a truly powerful weapon - the sling. As a result, his victory may not have been so  improbable after all.<br /><br />Carrying the the David and Goliath theme throughout the book, Gladwell devotes many chapters to specific individuals, whether famous or relatively unknown, who had to confront crucial questions and challenge assumptions about power and success. Is it better to play by the rules or follow one's instincts? Persevere while ignoring those who say failure is inevitable? Discard traditional ways of looking at challenges and come up with new innovations - or decide to simply conform? Perhaps there are actually advantages hidden amid what many perceive as disadvantages. Gladwell supports his conclusions with  detailed research studies  as well as examples from those he interviewed.<br /><br />.I found many of the portraits of the individuals in the book to be inspiring, a challenge  to a fair number  of my own assumptions about the path to a successful and fulfilling life. One example is Vivek Ranadive', a man who decided to teach his daughters how to become formidable  basketball players -  in spite of the fact that he had no experience as a coach. He created unconventional methods for turning his daughters' basketball team into winners (even though they were far less experienced than their rivals).<br /><br />As Gladwell writes, he \\"coached a team of girls who had no talent in a sport he knew nothing about.\\" So what accounted for his incredible success? Perhaps simply being willing to try methods no one else had attempted- at least, not to the same degree.And this is a major point of the book, one that is hammered home repeatedly: those \\"giants\\" who seem to have big advantages may have significant vulnerabilities as well.In contrast, those with seemingly lesser skills may be more innovative, creating  new businesses, challenging traditional models, changing schools for the better- and more. The possibilities are exciting.<br /><br />I did have problems with some parts of this book. Chapter Four focuses on David Boies, a man who has what Gladwell terms a \\"desirable difficulty\\", dyslexia. Yes, many famous innovators, from Richard Branson to Charles Schwab to the successful movie producer Brian Grazer, are dyslexic. But when Gladwell writes \\"You wouldn't wish dyslexia on your child. Or would you?\\" that gave this parent pause. While I certainly admire those who've turned challenges into successes, I find myself stopping short when it comes to wishing dyslexia on my child or seeing it as a \\"desirable\\" difficulty. That seems to be stretching a point too far, although I do understand that a part of that point is that setbacks may encourage compensations which topple seemingly insurmountable hurdles.<br /><br />But is this a given? I don't buy that. And even Gladwell notes that most people with disabilities can not master the steps required to compensate for limitations in other areas. But he also believe that \\"those who can are better off\\" and that \\"what is learned out of necessity is inevitably more powerful than the learning that comes easily.\\"<br /><br />In spite of Gladwell's inability to convince me that some difficulties are desirable, I found much information in David and Goliath to be thought-provoking and exciting. A wealth of studies are cited, skewering common beliefs left and right. Perhaps small class sizes don't always lead to optimal student achievement. And whilepoverty can threaten children's future success, the same might be said of those with wealthy parents. Beyond a certain amount (and I'll leave readers to discover that amount) there is substantial evidence that more money doesn't bring more happiness.<br /><br />This one left me questioning so many opinions that I'd assumed were correct. It was definitely an eye-opening and fascinating read.poverty can threaten children's future success, the same might be said of those with wealthy parents.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Being a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises alike I always feel compelled to get any new additions to the story, boy have the movie makers taken advantage of that.  Both the fans of Alien and Predator have had to put up with a lot of bad additions to the respective franchises.  Prometheus is part of the Alien franchise.<br /><br />The thing that surprised me most about Prometheus was how bad the acting was, don't know if it was just bad acting, bad script or bad direction, which seems hard to believe given the decent cast and great director.  Many times the actors reactions did not seem appropriate to the scene.  It appears as if they were directed to act one way and then editing may have made their reaction seem out of place.<br /><br />No doubt most of Ridley's time was spent on the set, nobody does sets better, he started as a set builder and designer.  Visually as a fan it was everything I hoped for but already knew that the visuals would be good because of Ridley Scott.<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better but can't help wonder if it was a little rushed.  A little let down but as a fan of the franchise I'm used to it.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I love it!<br /><br />I could relate because of the times I traveled and experienced jet lag.  Often wandering an airport or hotel and surrounding area in the middle of the night.  Can't tell you how many books I finished because of jet lag.  Lost in Translation really gives you that middle of the night jet lag feel<br /><br />The movie is quirky.  Honestly I have to wonder if this movie even gets made if not for the Coppola name.  The perfect movie to watch for those by themselves and experiencing jet lag.  Recommended to be watched in the middle of the night and by yourself.
1476727651|5.0|Mr. King has done it again. A brilliant book interwoven with his classic &#34;The Shining&#34; (which terrified me the most of all his books). Danny Torrence all grown up was a picture in and of itself. I found it very realistic that Dan was a drinker, a troubled man which makes perfect sense after his horrific childhood experiences. He evolves and grows and brings the wheel around. I don't want to write any spoilers so I can't say much more than this. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! I was drawn in from the page that defines what FEAR is.<br /><br />Stephen King is a master, and I want to thank him for what I consider one of his very best books - so far. Looking forward to more!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />your Number One Fan (not the creepy one though!)

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not see I can put into words how simply wonderful this story is.  Separating itself from others in the YA genre, The Fault in Our Stars will go down as one of the best Ever written.  Bravo John Green
B004HD61KE|5.0|Like all the Sigma Force novels, this one grabs the reader and doesn't let go - a thoroughly entertaining read!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|My husband recently borrowed my Kindle while we were waiting for an appointment and he downloaded this game. It's the Irish version of Super Mario Bros and they did a really great job with it. It's a nice fun game for all ages.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Did you like \\"Broken Arrow\\"?  Is that a fun to watch movie for you?  If so, then you will love this insultingly bad abortion.  The absolute epitome of what is wrong with people.  High flash, low substance, looks and snarkiness in place of actually getting to know the character.  A mega suck-fest of the highest order with a surprise twist at the end that would only be a surprise to a chimp that had suffered severe brain damage.  You people make me sick.  Seriously.  Don't waste your money unless you are very easily entertained - I'm talking a ball on a string in a cup.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far, I like it. It seems to have more features then AK notes by catch. I really enjoyed AK notes however I'm glad to have found evernote.  Thank you.
B00D3J2QKC|5.0|A real page turner. Also a real man's book! Can't wait to read other books by James Clavell. A total masterpiece!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic author...many lessons to be learned as with all his books. It makes you think about the important things in life and the many people and things we take for granted.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really enjoy this game on my kindle fire! It is a different type of puzzle game altogether!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This little app removes one of the small irritations of the Kindle Fire HD...not knowing how much battery is left and not being able to tell when the battery charge is complete. This app makes it easy to see when the charge has completed. Otherwise, it's anyone's guess. Kindle is an awesome product. This app is a great addition.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Dad is an accomplished liar and con man. Why Sachi wanted anything to do with him after the phony call from Italy is beyond understanding.<br /><br />But it is mom who is the puzzling one. Although talented, she is clearly a nut case. AND she complicated it by sending $60,000 PER MONTH to the con man. For years!<br /><br />Finally, it is Sachi who one wonders about - very self-absorbed.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I came to read this book in kind of a roundabout way.  I saw promos about the Netflix series of the same name that is based on this book.  It looked fun so I got on Netflix to watch an episode and within 2-3 minutes discovered why it was on Netflix and not on a regular TV station.  The series is at least R-rated from the little I saw.  In that 2-3 minutes, however, I discovered that it was based upon this book.  I looked up the book and found many reviews that said that it was nothing like the series in terms of being crude and violent (I hadn't seen any violence in the show I guess that came later.)<br /><br />I cannot afford to buy all of the books that I would like to read but I have a library card and found that there was a digital copy in our State Library.  Probably because of the series there was also a really long waiting list to check it out.  I actually forgot that I had placed a hold, but a few days ago I received an e-mail telling me it was my turn and the book was available for check out.<br /><br />You will see from my rating that I thought this was a really good book.  The thing that really impressed me is that it reminded me of my own experiences in FPC Florence.  The author, Piper, is a woman so she was in a woman's prison but not surprisingly the Prison Camps are mostly the same.  We had the same CO (Correctional Officer) personalities. Some were pleasant, most were neutral, and some were there because they really liked having control over other people and did petty and sometimes downright mean things to exercise and show that control.  It is also true that there are differences in the way the official rules are written and the way they are enforced. I also found that the unofficial rules of conduct were the same, mainly having to do with giving the other guy (girl in her case) their privacy.  You don't ask about anybody's crime unless they bring it up.  You don't touch someone else's stuff.  You don't sit on anyone else's bunk without being invited to.  The slang was even the same.  Most interesting to me is that the inmate personalities were the same too.  Again good, neutral, and wow stay away from them.<br /><br />Over all I also thought that the book was well written.  Once or twice there seemed  to be  leap in the narrative, or an assumption that the reader knew something that I did not think had been explained well.  I almost felt like maybe a paragraph or a sentence or two might have been missing but I don't really think it was.  Now maybe this was just my ability to understand.<br /><br />There were several reviews that I read before I read the book that said that Piper seemed obsessed with reminding the reader that she had a degree from an elite University.  I did not see this.  Yes she did mention more than once that she had graduated from Smith but I always think she did it in a way that added to the story and that helped explain her perceptions.  Sometimes even calling herself out for having the wrong opinion of someone because of her own background.  Piper is very aware that she was fortunate to have had a private attorney instead of a public defender, to have people on the outside that could and would send her books and money for her account, and to have family and friends that did not abandon her but that visited on a regular basis.<br /><br />It is clear from reading the book that Piper is not a fan of mandatory minimum sentences or the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, although at 15 months her sentence  was a huge downward departure from what she would have had under the mandatory minimums.  She is not preachy about it though and I did not think it took over the book.  Although I do question the wisdom of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, I think that you could think that they were the greatest thing ever and still enjoy this book.<br /><br />Many people ask, especially with non-fiction, why the author wrote the book.  I think here the author wanted to tell her story and wanted the reader toknow how, at least in her experience, Federal Prisons work.  I think she also wanted to get the reader to think about what society is trying to accomplish when it incarcerates someone, what society should be trying to accomplish, and how well either of these things are being met.  She certainly did this in my case.know how, at least in her experience, Federal Prisons work.  I think she also wanted to get the reader to think about what society is trying to accomplish when it incarcerates someone, what society should be trying to accomplish, and how well either of these things are being met.

B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is so fun - it has become my 9 year old's favorite (and I must admit, I've spent many fun hours on it myself).  Well worth the money.
B008QLXSG8|4.0|Loved the story behind it. Bought it for my philosophy class and it made for good discussion. This probably wouldn't be something I'd read casually but as an assigned reading it was great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have used this with Android phone, Apple phone, Surface, and iPad.  They all work!  You can pause it from your device while it's playing.  Here is a great review that describes the features well:  [...]
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked it but uses the word &#34;right&#34; too much for me.  But I did enjoy the book and I'm now reading another Reacher book
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughters love this game, and would play for hours.  I find it useful as a non-stimulating game, very peaceful, with no loud noises.  Great game for not ramping kids up.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|One would not expect a 800 page plus novel, set in 1870s New Zeland to be such a page-turner. Scary to think what Eleanor Catton may end up doing to the world of literature. Stunning.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|If you have a bigger HDTV (like 38&#34; or bigger) you may want to spend the little extra money and get the HD version if your internet can handle it.  On our 32&#34; the non HD version looks really good but on our 47&#34; it looks a little grainy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Recommend this book for 13+ very impressed. All I have to say. Bye
080419257X|3.0|There are many aspects in this book which most readers would not know insofar as some historical background which is the richest aspect of the book.  I enjoyed hearing it rather than reading it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Kinda pretty fun game that is fast pace an should keep you occupied for awhile. Dunno if I would pay but gives you plenty of fun without paying.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I tried this based on the c-net recommendation, and they were right. Unobtrusive, doesn't allow the system down, and works well
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book. This was such a good book. I don't often like non-fantasy books but this was excellent. The Book Thief was set in 1939 during World War II in Germany. The narrator is Death. In the beginning I was confused. I wasn't sure what was going on but then I realized it was Death doing the narrating. He talks about colors a lot. That's the only part I find weird even though it comes across beautifully. Death becomes a secondary narrator as he reads through Liesel's story.<br /><br />The main character of this story is Liesel. We follow her throughout the years of the world. When we first meet her she's on a train heading for her new foster family with her brother and her mother. Since her mother can no longer take care of them, she has given them up to go to a foster home. While on the train, Liesel's brother dies and they end up burying him. This is the first time Death meets Liesel aka The Book Thief. This is the nickname Death has given her. She picks up a gravedigger's guide on how to properly dig graves. This is the first book she stole. At this point, Liesel doesn't know how to read.<br /><br />She ends up in Molching, Germany where she is taken in by Hans and Rosa Hubermann. She eventually grows to love these two people who have taken her in like she is their daughter. She calls them Mama and Papa and though she already has a mother, she thinks of them as her parents as well.<br /><br />Her best friend is Rudy. At first they aren't friends as she is easily annoyed by him. He's always asking for a kiss from her and she is always replying with something close to \\"hell no!\\" Rudy is a happy boy who ends up being a great and supportive friend for Liesel, even when she's going through hard times. Rudy takes care of her and watches her back.<br /><br />Forget the scythe, Goddamn it, I needed<br />a broom or a mop. And I needed<br />a vacation<br />This is Nazi Germany and there are many people in town who are part of the Nazi party and believe in the Fuhrer and his goals. However, there are also people in town who don't but they keep their secret well hidden. Liesel's family is one of those who does not support Hitler but they do not openly oppose him. At one point, to pay back a debt that he owed, Hans takes a Jew named Max into the house. Honestly, how they got him into their house was quite brilliant. Liesel and Max become close friends during the time he spent there.<br /><br />There is a tie for my favorite character. Rudy is an amazing boy and was extremely well written. But I also loved Hans. He and Liesel learned to read together. Working together she was able to get out of the younger kids' class and joined the class with kids her own age. They spent time learning words from the books Liesel stole and that Hans gotten for her by trading them in for tobacco.<br /><br /> Words and books have a big impact on Liesel's life. This part of the story resonates with me. I  have always loved reading. The English language is crazy and messed up and often times doesn't make sense but I love it. I've known how to read since Pre-K and I haven't stopped reading. Books can be an escape by they are also an adventure.<br /><br />There is so much heartache in this book but there is also joy. It's a wonderful roller coaster of emotions. I'm not ashamed to say that I cried at the end of this book even though I knew what was going to happen. We are given spoilers by Death throughout the story but it's only in the end that we find out the details. Talk about dreading the ending. I loved this book and has been placed on my favorites shelf. It fully deserves the 5 stars.<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"I am haunted by humans.\\"<br /><br />\\"A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship.\\"<br /><br />\\"Often I wish this would all be over, Liesel, but then you somehow do something like walk down the basement steps with a snowman in your hands.\\"<br /><br />\\"Of course, I'm being rude. I'm spoiling the ending,not only of the entire book, but of this particular piece of it. I have given you two events in advance, because I don't have much interest in building mystery. Mystery bores me. It chores me. I know what happens and so do you. It's the machinations that wheel us there that aggravate, perplex, interest, and astound me. There are many things to think of. There is much story.\\"
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very strange story that begins like a mystery novel and evolves into a science fiction novel with twists & turns and secrets and lies that go beyond imagination. \\"Pines\\" leaves craving more of the future of its characters.  Can't wait for book 2!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|If you have seen it - WATCH IT AGAIN!!!<br />You will not be disappointed.  Fantastic show.  Great bonus features.<br />Was hooked by episode 1 - now I'm a lifelong fan.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|I used this backpack for 2 good solid years of travel all over the world and through many airports.  It is a durable bag with a lot of room for your gadgets.<br /><br />I think its demise came when I upgraded to a Dell M6600 17\\" wide screen 6 months ago.  This laptop \\"barely\\" fits this laptop and you have to stretch the zipper over the corners of the laptop to get it to fit.  Eventually the zipper teeth broke off and one day, my bag popped open and sent my laptop crashing to the ground.  I would not purchase this bag again due to it not fitting a Dell M6600 without putting a significant strain on the zippers to close it.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Oh man I could say so much, but first of all I loved this book!!!!! If u love romance a bull headed alpha male u will love it too!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|ASUS TF300T tablet. My husband &amp; I have the same tablets. He installed the app about a week before I did. All I've managed to do is create an account.  Same message as everyone else &quot;.......try again later&quot;  Reinstall, no dice.  Reinstalled from Google Play...nada.  Someone got into the coding cookie jar it seems. Just wanted to lend support...it's not just Kindles that are having problems.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought the book was well written and very informitative. At times it was graphic.Made you wonder how an individual can be so cruel to other humans.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love this puzzle game! It's just challenging enough but not so hard where im sitting frustrated over it. Def recommend this
B008Y212PI|4.0|Easy enough to be a relaxing &quot;waiting room&quot; kind of game,  but not too easy to be boring.  I liked it.  Very nice FAOTD.  Would definitely recommend it for logic puzzle fans.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book grabbed my interest very quickly.  The three storylines coming together to make one heck of a fascinating book that I could not put down once they converged.  I need more...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an excellent book. I cried during the final chapter of the book. I am looking forward to reading more from Suzanne Collins.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I read the Black Swan years ago and it helped me see my way through a tough time on the financial crisis and keep my software company afloat, and then to measure risk well and take the right acquisition offer when it came.  This new book is mroe of Black Swan, but it is created so that people like me (and you, maybe) dont have to suffer through the ordeal of another Black Swan with the type of exposure you would otherwise walk into.<br /><br />Don't believe your Goldman Sachs or Meryll Lynch wealth advisor when he explains your portfolio is &#34;conservative&#34;.  It probably isn't, and most likely has risks hidden even from your advisor, and his boss. Do you own homework, hedge, operate on the principal that things can go very very very wrong very quickly, and be prepared to capitalize on opportunities. Better yet, read the book.
1904994679|5.0|This family LOVES these books, and they have been a Christmas tradition for about 20 years now!  Each year I have to be more creative so that these books are absolutely the last packages handed out - because immediately everything else must stop while the search for one thing or another starts  - and all is quiet for a few minutes before laughter and calls of &#34;look on this page&#34; begin!  And each person has to get their own copy of the book - so I usually wrap a large box or gift bag addressed to me, and hold onto it until the very end of all gifting  - even though now everyone anticipates the books!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this show. There is always a good ending and the acting is superb. It's like sitting back and reading a cozy novel.
B001U887N8|5.0|these are so nice for camping and running around out doors. They are comfortable and the lining comes out to wash when needed. The only thing is the lining is hard to get off and on the buttons, other that that, we love them.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Plot was predictable . Characters talked in a stilted, adolescent manner. Book was disappointing. Hope this review helps other readers.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I love how it frees memory and lets me know unnecessary programs.
0061353248|5.0|I loved reading this book. I actually did a speech at my toastmasters covering some of these topics. Very interesting stuff
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A Memory of Light was one of the greatest ending to a series I have read in a very long time!  Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job of completing this series.  Unlike the some of the previous titles (mainly pre Sanderon - The Gathering Storm) which progressed the series rather slowly, the last few titles including this one were real page turners.  It was hard putting this one down especially when I was up to the chapter specifically titled \\"The Last Battle.\\"  Now that I am done with the series a part of me wants to go back to the very first book and start reading the series again, I however will not because now that I have been recently introduced to Brandon Sanderson I intend to start reading his titles (recently finisihed \\"The Way of Kings\\" which was another page turner despite being a monster of a novel with over 1200 pages).<br /><br />To sum it up - if you love the Wheel of Time you will definitely appreciated this epic conclusion!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Have seen both on stage and this movie and love both!  The music and acting are excellent! Will watch again someday!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the interaction of the characters, and the progression of the relationship.  I loved the titilating context.  I don't recommend it to someone with a purient mind, or anyone under about 20 years old.
B008Y212PI|3.0|The pictures in the box don't look like the things they are suppose to be, but it is still pretty fun to solve the puzzles.
B00AEFY66U|2.0|After viewing the new Baz Luhrmann's splendid film adaptation, I reviewed Jack Clayton's 1974's film adaptation DVD<br />with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow for comparison.<br />I saw the film in 1974 in theatre and my recollection was long and boring, not very impressive.<br />Almost 40 years on, the film now looked dated, poorly directed and acted, albeit with a faithful adaptation from the book.<br />Film is a different medium from a book.<br />To make this film work, the viewers must be moved by the love and longing between Gatsby and Daisy.<br />Mia Farrow was wrongly cast as Daisy, much too mature while behaving like a 14 year old.<br />Robert Redford can never express pain and vulnerability, a poor choice for Gatsby whose love and passion after Daisy<br />are essential to make this film work.<br />Bruce Dern acted like a bully, not a moment believable as a polo playing rich boy.<br />Only Sam Waterston was able to maintain his acting dignity as the narrator Nick Carraway.<br />The film received 2 Oscar awards for costume design and musical score.<br />Theoni V. Aldredge's costume now looks cheap and unglamorous.<br />The party and crowd scenes lack any joy or fun of the bygone jazz age.<br />According to Leonard Maltin's review of this film:  A bland adaptation, faithful to the book, but lacks substance and power.<br />That says it all.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It had a great plot and, as a bonus, it was full of interesting history!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the interaction of the characters, and the progression of the relationship.  I loved the titilating context.  I don't recommend it to someone with a purient mind, or anyone under about 20 years old.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Twice I had to start over mostly my faults I was overwhelm with so many buildings and slow productions but now things are improved.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how-well made this film is.<br />I was expecting another Baz Lurhmann's showcase of song and dance while totally makeover of this classic.<br />Instead, this is the most matured, assured and well-made film by Baz Lurhmann to date.<br />The key to the success of any film adaptations of this classic is the casting.<br />Leonardo di Caprio gave an astonishingly good performance as the elusive, vulnerable and love-crazed Gatsby.<br />Carey Mulligan while not a true beauty in a sense but as Daisy she was able to project an emotionally fragile and shallow woman.<br />Joel Edgerton made Tom Buchanan an unsympathetic character totally believable and made the viewers appreciate his shrew motives.<br />Lastly, Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as the wide-eyed and kind-hearted Nick Carraway.<br />Credits must be given to Baz Lurhmann to keep this film adaptation under lid while concentrating on telling the story of that unfulfilled love.<br />The jazz age party scenes were nicely orchestrated and infused with pop music as a background mood enhancement.<br />Finally we have a film adaptation of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" that makes the viewers feel the sadness of the protagonist's tragic end.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun little game to pass the time.  I've never played a game like this and have enjoyed the challenge.  Nice graphics.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the interaction of the characters, and the progression of the relationship.  I loved the titilating context.  I don't recommend it to someone with a purient mind, or anyone under about 20 years old.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Amazing game, can be challenging but is addictive and fun :) I love them game and it  really good for all ages/abilities with different difficulty levels
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tube mate works amazingly , it does what it says for the things u are aloud to download . I love it .
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very good app. Easy to learn how to play. I would recommend purchasing this app. Graphics are very nice and colorful.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I just bought this little guy at Best Buy today and so far I'm in love! With a simple instillation of the drivers and a couple of searches on the web, I have it set up and ready to go using Pro Tools 10. With my wavs bunddle and a good sounding guitar, I'm finally able to record some electric guitar on my laptop and I couldn't be more happy! My next step is to get a nice set of studio monitors and a decent vocal mic. For a home studio, this is a good bang for your buck if you're just looking for something small and relatively easy to use as long as you know what you're doing and know the software you're using! But you can find any help you need on the internet and its relatively easy from there!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I started playing this game today and haven't been able to put it down.  I think it will keep me occupied for quite a while with the different levels.  Really like it!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I liked this book a lot because I am a fan of both the Percy Jackson series and the Heroes Of Olympus Series. I would recommend this book to anyone who is into an action/adventure story. But also someone who likes any sort of mythology.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|You know the huge minion craze going on? Yea, it all started with this movie. It's delightful and cute and funny and &#34;SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE!!!!&#34;<br /><br />Ok maybe not so much that last descriptor, but you'll understand after you watch it. :)
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is great for beginners to nonogram puzzles, but those who are more experienced will go through the app fairly quickly. Hardest puzzle is 15x15 which really isn't all that difficult. I suspect I will beat the game in a few hours. Really enjoyable as a FAOTD and I might even recommend it for newcomers for the genre, but the experienced folk might want to save their money for a more challenging app.<br /><br />For those who are looking for a larger and progressively more difficult (but still with plenty of easier puzzles), might I recommend CrossMe (play this one first) and CrossMe Color (after first one is completed and mastered, color tactics can be tricky and require a whole new way of looking at things). I spent a great many hours on those two apps, well worth the price tag. This app, on the other hand, is but a momentary diversion. Still fun though, while it lasts. Wish there was a larger board size.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|One of the most thought provoking books I have read. Leaving the ending Up in the air makes for some good discussions among readers.
B00594XOZU|3.0|It keeps saying to please try again later when I log in. It's making me so mad. Please fix this problem. I love KIK but at this time, I do not at all. :(
B008JJM88Q|1.0|this game was a lot of fun but then it got weird. When I wanted to stop it,  I couldn't get it to stop.  Then the music kept playing even when I had stopped the game.  I got nervous that it might be spyware so I tried to delete it from my phone.  I couldn't do it.  I finally had to go into my settings and get rid of it.  Buyer beware.....  Amazon,  you should not endorse this product.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Good movie just not 4 stars.  Much more reliable service than Comcast to rent from.  Thanks again Amazon, you guys rock.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book is awesome. I love how the man is really Marcus. This book is the best. I love it
B00FEN1C50|5.0|By far the best action movie I have seen this year.<br />I'm sorry...I cannot accept this award. This award goes to......<br />(Drum Roll)<br />PACIFIC RIM!<br />That was what I wanted transformers to be.<br />AND... All you people out there kept saying Godzilla blah blah blah....<br />This movie reminded me of my childhood hero. The Person that Godzilla called in for back up!<br /><br />ULTRA MAN!<br /><br />Pfffft. Did somebody actually think the power rangers was original?
B00F91SCXC|2.0|There were some decent action moments in the movie, and it's well acted.  But, overall, I was wholly disappointed.<br /><br />The writing is awful, the pacing was terrible, and the ending seemed like an afterthought.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I don't like lawyers but I like the lawyer shows. The shows show the lawyers going the extra mile to help their clients. The lawyers I have dealt with mostly don't seem to care about the clients.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book has the most original plot I have ever seen. Who out there hasn't wanted to kill someone for wasting their time? I know I'm guilty of doing just that. I've even closed my eyes and visualized it. Todd Thiede went one step further. He wrote about it.<br /><br />This book not only has a great plot but it also brings us new character's in Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlane. 2 young detectives that are the best in their town. I loved the story twists that involved these two wonderful characters.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed reading this book. I read it in one day and am begging for Mr. Thiede to finish the next book in the series. Yep, you read right. According to a small passage at the end of this book the author says it is the first in the Max Larkin Detective series.<br /><br />Get writing Todd I can't wait for the next installment.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game. A little repetitious at times, but still addictive.  The final picture is cool to complete. It is fun to guess what objects will be included.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a huge Daniel Craig fan and this did not disappoint.<br />The quality of the Blu ray is great. (Have not watched the dvd copy.)
1591845556|5.0|I  bought audio book now got the hard cover of the book. I really loved listening to Josh and now i want to read for him too<br /><br />I have read so many books on self development and training, to name a few (quantum learning, Buzan's Genius Formula and other books, Paul Schelee's genius Code & Photo Reading, Einstein Factor for Win Wenger) and so many others.<br />In my point of view , this one of the very exceptional. Josh is abridging so many native ideas and theories, and creating his own model that fits professionals to achieve their immediate targets, with their busy schedules. Josh's unique approach is suitable for the fast growing in the market of knowledge, which is also changing rapidly.<br /><br />Some of the example skills which have been described in details by the author will be skipped by me. the reason is that &#34;i am not interested&#34; but these skills can be substituted with your own lovable skills, after reading the original skill of course. For example, Yoga, i do not like it and cant love it, but i heard the whole method and will apply it on my favorite sport, Boxing.<br /><br />Networking is my profession, and Ruby programming can become my lovable, so i will learn Ruby without substituting it with other skill, after Ruby i will go for DOT NET programming language with the same method for Ruby, and so on.<br /><br />But there is a problem, the book says that you do not need to spend 10000 hours to learn a skill, I agree, but if you want to become a surgeon or read and understand Goethe's work, then you will definitely spend much more than 20 hours, because simply these are not skills.<br /><br />Josh's work is great, i am in love with his book and probably buy other books for him. In the audio version of the book, Josh him self is the narrator , he is not only reading good but also he is delivering his message with maximum potential, obviously because he believes in what he wrote himself.
0399208534|5.0|This is a classic book for any kid.  This version has the little finger holes to help show how he's eaten through all the food.
0307944689|4.0|I bought this for my sister who took tofel exam and she said that this book has helped her a lot for prepare for the exam.
B0000669JL|5.0|Of course I love it! Who in the world doesn't love Bob Marley? I mean really? What a silly question!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|This has nothing to with the book my Max Brooks, which was a great read, the cgi is silly beyond reason and superman Brad Pitt can heal his little girl\\"s asthma by telling her to just breathe thru her nose until they find some meds but by then the asthma just goes away, Super man Brad injects himself with a fatal virus that somehow makes him immune to the zombies and does not make him sick forget killing him. I lost interest in the characters in the first 30min, 1 star.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Robin Williams is great with Dustin Hoffman!  New continued story of the fantasy!  Watch with the family and have a wonderful journey@
B008Y212PI|5.0|Graphics are good.  Game runs well on Kindle Fire.  Tutorial is easy to understand.  No annoying ads or excessive permissions.  Lots of puzzles to explore with a decent variance of difficulty.  Overall, fun to play.
1932100660|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. Its a wonderful insight into the world of food and how nutrition knowledge reaches the consumer. Great read!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good app but way too long to wait for energy to top up :( found myself checking out other apps instead. Fix that and am sure people will be happier
B002E0JL4A|5.0|I LOVED ROBIN IN THIS MOVIE. NORMALLY I'M NOT A FAN OF COMEDIANS (THEY DONT KNOW WHEN TO TURN OFF!)<br />BUT ROBIN IS A BEAUTIFUL SERIOUS ACTOR AND IN THIS PICTURE HE WAS ABLE TO DISPLAY HIS SERIOUS SIDE AS WELL AS HIS FUNNY SIDE. I WISH MORE DOCTORS HAD HIS RESPECT/CONCEPT OF TREATING THE &#34;WHOLE&#34; PERSON.
B00FFVLYTU|5.0|This was the most gut-wrenching drama I have ever seen.  Every moment was visually beautiful, convincingly scripted, and acted with surreal skill.  I was so moved by the final episode that I basically shut down emotionally.  I had to - I am the mother of a 10 year old boy.  I will never forget this story.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I have an IPAD and didn't know what I was going to do to download pictures from an SD card. This is one thing Apple did wrong on IPADs, no SD card insert. Anyway, purchase this combo and have used the SD connection many times and works amazing!! Just insert connection to the power plug area and then insert the SD card and away it goes. Even keeps the photos separated as to the dates I download them.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game, but need to review or give out Facebook info to unlock &quot;keys .&quot;<br /><br />Loses a star for this request. No noticeable intrusive permissions.
B008Y212PI|2.0|It is pretty good. It is a little repetative but it is very easy to learn. I do not like being forced to rate it to unlock certain levels -2 stars
B001BANK32|5.0|Being a die-hard Stephen King fan, in all formats, I was SO excited for the release of &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;. I realized though I'd seen the movie (Kubrick's), I had never read it. Wow...the thriller Maestro had me reading from between my fingers.<br />Thanks Mr King! YOU ROCK!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It is well written, catching story. I am looking forward to read more of her books. I have discovered her
0857208748|5.0|So sorry that Vince Flynn died as he was a great storyteller.  I enjoyed all his novels.  I shall miss new stories.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I couldn't stop playing. I sincerely hope there are more levels added. I loved being able to progress, but I am sad that I have completed it.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A most enjoyable book, it was full of humour- maybe, unintentioned and great empathy and understanding of non mainstream people.  Worth recommending.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Another good cline eastwood film. He plays very blunt old school veteran and is offensive and hilarious at the same time.
B00FA5MU58|1.0|The quality of the this CD is the same as their last one. So is the lead vocal, the guitar riffs are the same, so are the drum beats. When are metal heads that ready should know that Metallica cannot change, going to accept that Enough is Enough. Greed is still their motivation, if not why can't you buy just one song -- no! You have to buy the whole CD.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|just like the real game. lots of fun no glitches.... defiantly enjoyable and worth the money. buy it you will have fun
B00785P2QC|4.0|My kid plays this game.I don't know exactly what he thinks of it but he seems to enjoy it.<br />Thanks.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie was very interesting and i found it rather original. It was another end of the world plot but still it was interesting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|While I understand that ads pay for the free app,the constant ads drive me crazy. I thoroughly enjoy playing but an ad every couple of games would be a much better solution to the complaint of most users.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|What I like is how it tells about count noun and how it sees that count noun is a person that kills their mother I like how it tells about what different kind of killers their are.<br /><br />What I don't like is how it tells about killing.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day thinking it would be like crossme, to my surprise it had the fun of that app but in a different way. Very fun to play while still giving your brain a workout
B00C33M2EE|5.0|CD & DVD! I love just putting this on when I'm working. The DVD or the CD. It is just great music to have on!
B000VLOKQI|3.0|This is an excellent history of The Who. It is not a great film like The Kids Are Alright. Let the music do the talking.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate, city-specific weather forecasts daily and hourly. I never used to check weather reports so much before. Very useful when u travel also. Provides forecasts for 7 days ahead. I use it very regularly as my sole weather forecasts source.
B0000844I8|5.0|If u love the series stargate u will love the movie. It's the movie b4 the series started. Thanx from my whole family
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A wonderful and entertaining story!  A wonderful tale told through the eyes and ears of our most trusted companion.  It was very easy to relate to the different scenario's of the book due to the fact that I myself treated my Gami like he was human and could interact with me.  The story captivates so many aspects of everyday life and the small things that we do not notice from our pets.  The story was most compelling to me as I could relate to Enzo's zest for life and his know how on when to say goodbye as I myself have my precious Gami at Rainbow Bridge.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|fast paced the first chapter grabs you a can't put down book there are four main characters that meld thier stories together wonderful!!!!
B00DYEBM3I|4.0|Mazzy Star, still creating that lovely spaced out music I used to listen to so much. What a wonderful thing that they can release an album that sounds just as wonderful as the music from the 90'. It has been a long time, I missed you Mazzy Star.<br /><br />Seasons of your Day is a lot like the previous three albums, druggy, hypnotic, spaced out, psychedelic, mood music. Hope Sandaval sounds as sensuous and drugged out as she did fifteen years ago, her voice is still hauntingly beautiful. David Roback is still doing cool things with his guitar, slipping in a little bit of slide here and there at just the right moments. The music is slightly updated and a little bit more modern. I've listened to this CD through about 10 times (several times back to back while I was driving). I swear, I still can't tell when I've gone through a full loop of the album. Mazzy Star just takes me someplace else, in a good way.<br /><br />Maybe it is a good thing they took this long to make another album. They might have gone the way of the Cowboy Junkies, too many of the same thing too soon.<br /><br />This is an excellent album. I really did miss Mazzy Star and am happy to listen to them again.
B008Y212PI|3.0|its an OK app would be better if you didn't have to<br /> write a review or like their Facebook page to get the bonus page but decent app overall
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Do you do this in the best way for the creators to go back in the creators to go back and watch them with beard and you do use of janitors sorry the world is going on a little more about it suckup to go back and forth to go to
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.  The writing and character development is exceptional.  There are recurring characters that continue to be woven into the storyline.  Michael J Fox's character shows up for plot twists and turns and is a natural fit to the cast.  I really have enjoyed this show and am trying to finish season 4 as the new season just started this week.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I enjoyed this so much. Steve Carrell is endearing as the lost, discarded husband of mid-life crisis sufferer Julianne Moore. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have wonderful chemistry. The writing is smart and funny, and I will definitely watch it again.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I really like this game, but only gave it 3 stars because there is no way to turn the music off; and you can't see your score but for a couple of seconds and then it's behind everything else.  If those things were fixed, I would rate it 5 stars.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This game is tons of fun, challenging, and smooth. No problems loading, or playing, no glitches, etc., it just works.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I chose to read this book because it got good reviews; but I have learned that just because a book was given 5 stars, doesn't necessarily mean it deserved 5 stars to my way of thinking.  That being said, I felt this book truly deserved 5 stars.  I couldn't guess what the husband's secret was, and was utterly shocked to learn what it was!  At the beginning of the book, it was difficult to see how all the characters and the storyline would come together at the end, but they did and it all fit very well together.  Having been married to the same man for 40 years, I learned how divorced women think and the problems they must deal with.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very much enjoyed watching Judi Dench and Bill Nighy fall in sweet senior love in India, surrounded by other great character actors.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far, I'm really enjoying this game. But I haven't been playing it too long. If you like hidden object games, you'll love this game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great version of mahjong. Simple, attractive, and easy to play. The game has performed perfectly so far, and I highly recommend it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very entertaining and thought provoking. Would recommend to those who want a  challenge and enjoy exercising your brain. Must play game. my kids like playing this game too.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I was not familiar with Tom Courtenay until this film; he is the quietly charming, stalwart center of this heart-warming movie. Billy Connolly is perfect as the smart-ass whose filters are all gone, Pauline Collins is equal parts funny and heartbreaking as a ditzy diva, and Maggie Smith is wonderful, as always, as the opera star come-down-in-the-world. Michael Gambon was very funny as the reigning boss of everyone. I didn't know Dustin Hoffman was the director until I saw the credits. Well-directed, well-acted, and the setting was beautiful.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|This is a great way to monitor your baby (video, temperature/humidity reads, music, lights).  I highly recommend the investment for any new parents - instead of just knowing that your baby is crying or making noise, the way old baby monitors work, you can actually see what they are doing and know if you should go in and disturb them or let them be.  We have been using the baby monitor since birth and give it much credit in getting our baby to sleep through the night at 2 months!!  We knew when to disturb him and when to let him fall back asleep.  And I love that I can check up on him sleeping in his crib while at work or traveling.  A really great product!!<br /><br />The only \\"watch-out\\" I would offer (and hope Withings fixes soon) is that the app works better on iOS than it does on Android.  Given that the majority of smartphones are Android, it would make sense to have better functionality there.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is super awesome I play it almost every hour breeding to get different dragons it's so cool then you got the growing of the crops with all sorts of different kinds it's sometime difficult to decide what to plant
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|my son and I absolutely LOVE playing this game together... we play it every night together and always have a great time...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it. I have played for quite a while without having to pay any money. I play until I run out of energy. Then I stop and come back when my energy is recharged. You can also receive prizes of energy for successfully completing tasks.
B008Y212PI|3.0|had fun playing the easy levels. really does help pass the time when waiting. just wish i didn't have to write a review to get the bonus levels
B00594XOZU|1.0|It won't me log in anymore which is frustrating because it logs in perfectly on my iPod touch .fix this please
B000000H57|5.0|My boyfriend bought me this album 16 years ago..and I've played it so much that it's scratched to death..it is the only CD I've ever really cared about replacing. I listen to a wide variety of music, and this is by far my favorite album to listen to, especially at this time of year. I wish Peter Steele was around to make more music..but we do have what he's left us, and this is a masterpiece. I love it so &#60;3
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Man I love this, and I watch it whenever I can. The combo of the Blu-Ray, DVD and digital is perfect and it means I can watch it wherever whenever.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I am super happy with this purchase. It has all of my favorite songs and was a worthy investment. Can't go wrong with Katy. Every song makes me want to dance!
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|A leisurely day with her sisters turns into the beginning of a life full of guilt, regret, and crushed dreams for young Amanda. Her formerly happy family is torn apart as one of the sisters falls through the ice and drowns. Amanda's father, while having a hard time himself dealing with the loss of one his daughters, has to keep working and try to offer emotional support to the mother, his wife, who is quickly descending into the life of drinking and sleeping. The two remaining sisters are devastated and guilt-ridden.<br /><br />Amanda spends the rest of her short childhood trying to get over her guilt but also pursue her passion of dancing. And just when things are getting slightly better for Amanda, with her move to a larger town to pursue her career in dance, real tragedy strikes. Amanda's life gets filled with disappointments, a string of bad luck and bad decisions, dishonest and abusive men, and financial ruin.<br /><br />And when it seems that Amanda cannot endure any more suffering, she finally meets a decent man and starts a family with him. But if you think that this is going to be a typical happily-ever-after-rags-to-riches novel, you are in for a surprise. Amanda's story will take a few more unexpected twists and turns until a certain sense of closure is reached.<br /><br />This book is a brutally honest look at the dark side of human existence and human condition, written in a language to match that honesty. If you are easily offended, choose a different writer. If you appreciate honesty and stories written from the heart, I highly recommend this book.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is super fun and addicting. I was not sure what to expect at first, it was kind of confusing at first but once I got the hang of it, it was fun.
B003EY7JH6|4.0|The very beginning of it all. And such a delightful beginning. Asimov is a master of Sci-fi and the human touch.  JA
0385743564|3.0|One of the most prevalent questions geeks can throw around and debate for long hours into the night are meta-human powers. What power is the most powerful? What power is TOO powerful? Does Superman suck because he has too many powers? If you could be any superhero solely on the basis of their powers and nothing else, which would it be? What could be the loopholes in so and so power? Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Obviously, this kind of thing becomes an outlet for many creative and artistic works - Steelheart being one of them. The problem with the genre is, however, that so much of it has been done already and settings like the X-Men (with its numerous offshoots) are so pervasive in modern pop culture that it's difficult to bring something new to the table. So much so that I find myself looking for depth of characterizations, plot and just general worldbuilding than really expecting anything that hasn't been done with regards to the genre.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Steelheart is, at best, mediocre on most fronts.<br /><br />The premise of the setting is, as stressed, a run-of-the-mill point in time wherein meta-humans (referred to as \\"Epics\\") developed powers and began to run rampant in the world. There are little jabs and hints at a deeper reason behind this development, but that is never explored within the course of the book, which is understandable, given the length of the book and the ending that left expectations for a sequel.<br /><br />However, the book also struggles with trying to be dark enough to give a sense of realism while at the same time straddling the Young Adult category - what comes out is a confused mess that confuses flat, quirk-reliant characters for those fit for the young adult category while mistaking callousness towards death and prejudice towards the meta humans as being enough to engender a dark, realistic setting. There is no real sense of hopelessness that the reader can ever really sympathize with, which is both surprising and disappointing, given its first person narrative, and despite the fact that Newcago is clad in steel, there is a lot of black and white and very little gray.<br /><br />This is a far cry from the other YA novel I read from Sanderson - the Rithmatist, which had subtler adult themes and a more youthful and creative energy that persisted to the end of the book (the way Sanderson designed chalk-magic strategies to be discussed as someone would chess was particularly enjoyable). Both protagonists are youthful know-it-alls of magic or Epics respectively, but (and this may be because chalk-magic was inventive and Epics are derivative) David's immaturity and rashness were grating, especially for a character professed to have been circumspect enough to have survived in a post-apocalyptic world such as the one Steelheart is set in.<br /><br />I could go on, but the bottom line for this book is this: there are far better examples of both this premise and the type of work Sanderson excels at.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was my first time trying this type of game and after going over the tutorial about 5 times and getting the hang of it I have to say I love the game.  A great way to pass the time and it makes you think. Don't like the fact that to get the &quot;bonus&quot; I either have to go to facebook or post a review.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I am really glad I watched this documentary. I am not a music buff by any means but I found this to be extremely interesting. Sound City is the name of a recording studio that put out some of the best records in history. I don't want to give a synopsis because then you wouldn't feel as inclined to watch this. But if you like music at all, this place, Sound City, holds a bigger spot in your heart than you realize. It's that important. It's a great history lesson and has interviews with some incredible people, and I cannot recommend this documentary enough. I gave it to a music buff friend of mine and he talks about it all the time. Dave Grohl made this, and he does a really fantastic job at paying homage to a really special place, a really special sound board, and all the people who were instrumental (pardon the pun) in making this obscure studio an extremely pertinent fixture in American music.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Perfect for a quick check in the morning while getting the kids ready for school. I us  it multiple times a day. I also like the rewards program that comes with it. You earn points towards gift cards. It may take a while but a great bonus to the app!
B00CT5NDHQ|4.0|Sliver has finally arrived on blu ray. I am not going to review the movie as I am sure you know the story, but the blu ray.The colours are strong and vibrant and picture image is sharp.Audio is in English stereo 2.0 and picture ratio is 2.1:1same as on dvd. There are no extras not even movie trailer.It runs for 106 minutes, blu ray made in Mexico it is not unrated but R same as dvd and is the same as dvd no scenes cut except where Zeke having sex with Naomi has been cut in small part.<br />It is a worthy upgrade if you like Sharon Stone movies. It is a good movie,but I think it has been grossly underrated.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Even though we already saw this movie at the theatre, it was a must have. This is a great movie for the price we paid. Stores charge so much more for the same exact item. It completed my son's Batman collection of movies. Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS IS the GREATEST APP EVER but it takes a while to load but it makes the graghics great.<br />Its awesome
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Bauer is the freaking man. A Great show. Can't wait till next summer when its back for a short run.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This game is fun, and its free! Its an awesome puzzle, and rarely easy. So your puzzle is free! Creeper
B008Y212PI|5.0|Best control system for this type of game. I like the way completed items appear on the big pictures. Good price for a good product.
B003KKBPXI|3.0|I am not a big fan of his post retirement music. This CD is okay. Pleasant enough, but lacking in depth, although I am sure he wasn't going for depth. What I love about Miles the man is he was adventurous and risk taking, mostly before he retired. Miles was always a trend-setter and was not afraid to be outside musically or pop/contemporary. The picture on the back of the record jacket is framed and on my wall.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging. It makes the simplest things hard to make out but thats part of the fun. I read some of the bad reviews and they said it does not work without Wi-Fi but it worked fine for me. I totally agree for you to buy this app.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This app is amazing you should download now,It`s better than jetpack joyride you can select your own birds witch is amazing
B000006045|5.0|Awesome stuff. Another CD I bought based on my relentless search for music I might like. I highly recommend this music.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like the game... not too short for its cost. Although these games are fun they are quite speedy. Don't like paying nearly five dollars to get the whole game... one of the few that are worth it though
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is superb especially, in my case, as an 88 year old pensioner.  It keeps your brain alert and I must admit it has got me hooked.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This story was gruesome and fascinating. I'm still not sure why orphans are at the bottom of a homogeneous country. The ordeals suffered by the protagonist were excruciating. Is it possible that after all he had suffered, he could finally find himself with a family to whom he could give love? I'm told that power corrupts, and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. I guess this is a perfect example.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is great. I had previously purchased it from google play for my Android phone BUT google installs it in an area where it is not recognised at boot up! (AS MANY OTHER USERS HAVE FOUND). The Amazon installer overcomes this, many thanks, I won't be returning to Google Play.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|seriously. this album has moments where you feel like you are sitting quietly by, while dave pours out his soul...so bare, so raw, so sincere and heartbreaking. i will never know the trouble and pain that he has endured and survived, but i feel like he has shown me how damaged and weary and grateful one can be coming out the other side.<br /><br />i am not familiar with the soulsavers outside of this release, but i am thankful for the collaboration between many obviously talented artists. the music is cinematic, sullen, and chillingly beautiful at times. i can hear a little leonard cohen and nick cave in the songs - the gospel/hymnal touch is not unknown to these artists either - but dave's strong and emotional vocals are purely his own. there is a clarity and maturity to this songwriting that i hope to see again. i felt drained after listening to this album, in the very best of ways.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is fun and addicting and great for not being bored, I recommend this to anyone, not even that it is free!
B00119ZMKW|4.0|This episode is well done, yet loses some of the earlier care the viewer placed on the team. Daniel is absent from this season, but Jonas does a good job filling in for the ascended Daniel.<br />This season had interesting plots, but somehow didn't capture the earlier SG1 close - tight bonds within the team.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me Minion Rush is hours of fun, challenging, and highly addictive. You do need an internet connection to get the app all set up and download content.
B00338QENI|5.0|The book was informative and a pleasure to read. I found myself looking old science books and questioning things like the expense of breast cancer genetic testing.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Long time Trek fans have a lot to like about the JJ Abrams recent films. The actors have successfully channeled their characters from the originals with just slight change to make them their own.The known trek universe has changed a lot, but is still recognizable to us older fans. There is a good balance between the action and technology and good, old fashioned story telling and characterization. I am so anxious to see where it goes to next, now that the 5 year mission is underway. I am hoping that this time, Abrams will get it right and NOT kill off Kirk's son, David, who has so much potential to add to the show mix.<br />I recommend this to any and all Trek fans past and present. My 2 granddaughters, 6 and 8 watched this the whole way through with interest, so any new, young fans to be should watch it, too. My son, who is a Next Generation fan, also is thrilled with the new direction the films have taken. With appeal to 3 different generations, it is not hard to say this film is a winner.
159308336X|1.0|This book is bound wrong. It is missing 30+ pages and now I am stuck with it because they will not take it back.
B00C81LYH2|4.0|This doll is very pretty, however, it came to me in the mail with the box torn, and any Barbie collector knows if the box is messed up, it ruins the whole doll, needs better package, I gave it to my granddaughter and bought me another at walmart, I was very disappointed with the box torn.
B00008NRL8|5.0|If you need an intro to Gotan Project and its beautiful electronic tango, try this album first.<br />You won't regret it, totally recommended for you.  This was my first experience with Gotan Project when I lived in Argentina - Buenos Aires.
B00004WX4X|5.0|Arguably the greatest rap album ever recorded. Every track on this LP remains as haunting and hypnotic as they were almost 20 years ago.
B0050DIWHU|3.0|Liked the ideas and concepts talked about in the book. at times, the book felt like a LinkedIn brochure. the book has awesome ideas and I felt the book could have been more concise and shorter after the first few chapters since that was the core of the book and it spent too much time talking about risk and it repeated itself way to many times. Overall, it was a good read and had some good ideas for people like me that know very little about business.
B00821OX98|5.0|Best Alien program or movie I have seen in a long time.<br />In the same class as &#34;Alien&#34; the movie
B00EI6E17A|5.0|When you're hot your're hot,and Gaga is steaming with one hit after another,Of course,I like some of her songs better than other ones.I like this Applause song because of the particular rhythm and mechanical sound.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this show!!! I never knew what all the fuss was about until I actually sat down and watched an episode. I was hooked immediately.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Robert Jordan built a world that I escaped to during times. I saw everything in my minds eye and lived the story ever page of the book and the series. I would recommend this book and series to anyone wanting an escape to a world of possibilities, especially when the world is after a farm boy in your life too.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Let's see, I'm being asked to pay for a Blu-Ray disc, a DVD and UltraViolet, which I never use. I missed this movie in the theaters, and I'm looking forward to seeing it. But at this price with features I don't want, I'll just stream it from my cable company.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Honestly, the worst of the trilogy.  I was looking forward to reading this one considering I read the other two in less then four days total. This one took me over a week because there was nothing to draw me into picking it up again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am going to have fun learning to play this game! I grow to love my Kindle Fire more and more every day. Cute game from a good movie.
B007STXHTM|1.0|Mine leaked on the second snorkel adventure. I should have stuck to the original Hero 2 case which worked flawlessly for over a year. The first dive gave me false confidence. With all underwater gear, please make sure you have a seal before taking your device under.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Very happy with my purchase.. Great add to my collection. I keep them in boxes, so not sure on quality. Great doll and accessories.
B00EJYGQFG|1.0|The only reason this song gets 1 star is because its catchy.<br />Why are people saying this song is \\"inspiring\\" \\"creative\\" and \\"original\\"?<br />\\"I live for the applause, applause, applause...give me that thing that I love...\\"<br />....yeah those are some DEEP lyrics.<br />Times up for Lady Gaga. It's time for her to go and be weird on another planet.
B00F3HQMV6|5.0|Krewella electrifies with their newest tracks on this sophomore album, their symphonic highs and deep bass fill the CD. Jahan's and Yasmine's voices are mesmerizing and Chris &#34;Rain man&#34; brings the storm of beats throughout. I was surprised to hear the variety of EDM on this CD, though Krewella has been known for their furious dubstep, they spun fantastic house, trance, and even digi-dub style on this record. All and all, consider yourself soaked, Krewella's promise to make you wet one song at a time came true.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is written like he is writing letter to you. At first I was not sure I was going to like this book. As I continued to read I start to feel for each person, and all of there problems. The ending explained a lot of the questions I had.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can't wait for the next season! I guess because it gives an insite as to how the well-off lived in that era and also because they had their problems too!

B0091W0ILY|5.0|I watched this movie as a kid and now I'm watching it with my own child as a stand in for his horror movie cravings. This helped me have something on hand for him to watch without giving him nightmares for weeks. I recommend it for anyone who needs light horror for a child to watch, it's great.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game fun way to pass time. Puzzles are easy to start with but get harder as you go. Will probably buy other games like this one.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|What ISN'T great about this movie or the soundtrack.  Always have loved the movie and the music takes you there without even watching it.  It's beautiful.
030746363X|5.0|This book is amazing! I was a D1 Athlete and what I really love about this book is how it can relate to everyone, across many levels of experience and physical prowess. Is the whole book amazing? No, I really didnt care for the sex part, that to me really seemed out of place but I did find that how Tim used his diet to increase his sexual prowess was pretty interesting.<br /><br />Down to the nitty gritty: This book has all the details you need or don't need and Tim Ferris will let you know that. If you want jsut a simple do and don't for many things Tim will accommodate that. If you want expanded explanations to the do's and don'ts then well you will have that too. One thing about Tim Ferris, if you have read any of his other books is you notice a trend of trying to capitalize on your needs, really sieze an opportunity to sell you something. THis book is no different, but I found that I was ok with it.<br /><br />One of the biggest takeaways from this book for me was the Slow-Carb diet, awesome diet in principle and really not terribly hard to practice. He makes recommendations on supplements like HGCG and this is where his sales skills come in to play. The diet alone will allow you to get you to your desired wight but the advent that his supplement stack can get you there and help you sustain it is very commercial, but not entirely untrue.<br /><br />I found that this book covered a wide range of topics that can help you better understand and improve your body. Does everything in the book work for everybody? NO... but it will give you something to try, and more importanlty it addresses many of the issues that plague so many of us.<br /><br />I love to reference this book often as I find that the information contained within is like a one source stop for most of my physical needs. I highly recommend this book as it is easy to read and contains a lot of pertinent information.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I like the game it is fun and does not require to much time to play it. good game. yep
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game to play, makes you think. The levels get harder and more fun as they are so interactive. I would recommend it
B004YXE438|5.0|Fabulous!  Better than expected -- love that my own pictures can be used for the puzzles. And that different degrees of difficulty.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|WOW ! Never saw this end coming. Sounds cliche, but a must read!  I expected drama, a lot of sex, and emotions, and Sylvia Day delivered. Again, I loved this book. I laughed, cried, and absolutely loved this story. And she teases the readers at the end of the book, knowing she has you hooked...! Like when is the next book coming out.? I can't wait!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Wonderful game -- so often I intend to play for 5 to 10 minutes but, 45minutes later..... I'm still playing it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|From the beginning I was hooked. An amazing book that everyone should read at some point in their life, especially those that have ever felt like an outcast.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I absolutely love the minions but there seem to be too many automatic updates and additional downloads. All in all I think it's worth the hassle. It's free so might as well...
B00005JKDR|5.0|Movie arrived pretty quickly. Happy with the purchase. Originally saw this movie in the theaters with my now 15 year old and this copy is for my  2 1/2 year old. Trying to prepare him so I can watch the newest movie. Love this movie. I purchased used copy that was in excellent shape. Most of the characters were delightful.
B0083Z614S|3.0|I found that it was a very slow book and for me, a chore to finish. Maybe a pre-teen would enjoy it more that I did.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A wonderful read that embraces all elements of the personality including what is the&#34;norm&#34; and what isn&#34;t and who says so. Definitely one to recommend.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I'm having a good ole time here.  Its a nice little distraction from my daily routine.  Those Tree fairies are pretty cool.
B00E9E4EC8|1.0|Alan Jackson is no more a bluegrass singer than I am.  I wasted my money on this CD.<br />If you like bluegrass music do not get this one because it is no good.
B001HM1PFO|1.0|bought this to watch and when i clicked on the play , it displayed that this video will not play, so i watched it on u-tube instead. I t should be removed so this won't happen to anyone else.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|Somehow Phillip Kerr gets good ingredients, but just doesn't really get it all mixed and cooked properly for a really satisfying dish. Interesting characters and locale here, but you just are not ready to catch the next plane to Praha.<br /><br />A really good Alan Furst novel puts this to shame. I will try another Bernie Gunther, but one a year is fine.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series! I've been a \\"slave\\" to this series since i read the very first book and the latest installment does NOT disappoint!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of this sexy series!
1451696191|3.0|I saw the movie first, and fell in love with it and wanted to immediately read the book, and so I did.<br /><br />Seeing the movie and seeing what the main character was reading and how he received such special attention from his English teacher, I expected the book to be better written. It's similar story line, but eesh it's like reading a 12 year old's diary. This is the rare occasion where I actually enjoy the movie over the book. It produced a great movie, but I just couldn't stand reading in the style it was written.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I had downloaded several games of this type - Crossme, Griddlers Plus, and Picranium Picross - but as far as I can tell, this is the best of them. With the other three games, I didn't like the input method, the aesthetics, or either.<br /><br />Input with this one is more intuitive and efficient than with the other three. You first select the squares, then select either the color to fill them or the mallet to smash (delete) them. This way, you can process several squares, including non-consecutive ones, at the same time and you're far less likely to make mistakes. The game play is a bit different from the others. With the others, you keep filling squares and basically if you make a mistake there's not much help, so you can get almost all the way to the end a puzzle and get stuck, which is very frustrating. With Griddlers Plus there is a hint button which will fill in a square for you. With this game, however, if you make a mistake, it will correct it for you but mark the tile with a big red X. If you get three X's, you have to start over. You can override this setting, however.<br /><br />The game also looks good visually. The tiles are nicely drawn and being able to smash unused tiles with the mallet instead of just marking them with an x is rather satisfying.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I now own the book, the movie, and the soundtrack.  Into the Wild is totally amazing.  Every song Eddie Vedder did for this soundtrack is incredible.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Now THIS is what a battery monitor is supposed to be!  For a while now I've been using this on two Kindle Fires and the monitor really seems to be accurate. Being kind of geeky, I like the way it gives me more information about the battery functions than I really, really need.<br /><br />The most important part to me is that it accurately shows the remaining read time I have on the Kindles and I don't have to panic when the built-in Kindle battery icon is almost down to zero - this monitor can actually tell me that I have another 45 minutes of read time before I have to charge.<br /><br />And... it has great looking graphics!
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|I love everything by Tim Burton.  I love Helena Bohham Carter, too.  The songs and acting in this movie are brilliant.
B008742O32|5.0|This is my go-to program when I want to pull photos or files off my phone.  It's easier than hooking up a cable, and plenty fast on my home wireless network.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|So ,as an inherifreak ,I am gonna give a good review. I honestly dont care if the violence is grapic... its written for teenagers. I love how long it is and the new words i learned.<br />i love how it got me involved; i laughed when they laughed, cried when they cried, and practically flipped out when Eragon did something incredibly stupid and screwed up. I swear I became a character in the book. The dry humor used is quite entertaining.<br />*SPOILER AHEAD*<br /><br />I cried when oromis dies. he was ummm whats the word... droll. so was angela.<br />I wonder how paolini came up with these stories. I cant wait to read the last book in the Cycle!
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is awesome now only if they wouzld let me put in my Mendel game thing and and cool.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Can't get enough credits to play for long,other wise I love it.<br />Would recommend all try it on phone or computer!
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Awesome game feels like real pinball on some awesome tables should offer at least 2 more free tables or at least make them all just a dollar
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Amazing game. As usual Iron Man rocks here in this game too...great graphics, great views,great experience while playing. Best game ...must download. I am surprised. Why such a great game is available free of cost....thanks a lot for giving it free of cost.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game was easy to learn and I really like the final results.  They are very detailed.  Being a beginner at playing puzzles online, I really enjoy playing this game.
B00BCCE3VM|5.0|I sat down with this disc and a dozen other recordings, including [[ASIN:B0013AUX9E Horowitz]], [[ASIN:B0002J58V0 Perahia]], [[ASIN:B000MX7ST6 Arrau]], [[ASIN:B000001G5H Pollini]], and many others. I wasn't sure what to expect, but to my surprise, Jan's interpretations are so fresh that his Chopin Etudes more than earn their place among the recordings of those titans. Jan brings two new things to the table: unprecedented restraint and unprecedented use of textures.<br /><br />Take Op. 25 No. 1, which has two things going on: melody and arpeggios. Chopin weaves the melody and arpeggios together to crescendo into a dramatic peak, then spends a moment in a quiet lagoon, then ends the piece. Like all of the etudes, the structure is ternary form, or A-B-A. Pianists tend to play the melody lyrically and the arpeggios as the splendiferous wonders that they are. The dramatic peak is big and romantic and emotional, and allows for much keyboard banging if desired (for one extreme of this, see [[ASIN:B0091XIZO0 Lang Lang]]).<br /><br />Now look at what Jan does: he starts the etude from an extremely quiet place and keeps those magnificent arpeggios on a tight leash throughout: quiet, controlled. He plays the melody plainly, simply, emphatically un-lyrically -- almost Gouldian -- in the piece's first half. Most recordings treat this ascent and climax like climbing to the top of a jagged mountain lined with fake Roman ruins, in a thunderstorm, but Jan's buildup is so subtle and finely grained that when he does reach that climax, we're only standing a few feet above where we started, so to speak. And then Jan pulls off his most impressive trick: in the \\"quiet lagoon\\", he gently, ever so slightly, allows the melody a lyrical quality, some moments of quiet emotion.<br /><br />There's storytelling here. Jan is saying something with this music, and he's saying something quite new with it.<br /><br />Technically, Jan's outstanding, and if he's not (yet?) at the level of the gods like[[ASIN:B000040OX7 Ashkenazy]] and Pollini who've tackled the Etudes before, that's no insult-- the young man is at least running in their company. What's extremely impressive is that Jan brings the subtle textures he so expertly applies to slow passages to the bravura parts, as well-- varied, interesting textures that I find rarely in the Etudes of the aforementioned Chopin Gods. Take Op. 10 No. 1, one of the most technically challenging pieces of piano music ever written. Chopin Gods like Perahia and others play this so fast, loud, and incredibly, that you wonder if they are even human. Jan plays impressively, but he also draws forth the darker voices of the piece which get lost the faster and more impressively one plays it, and gives the arpeggios a variety of different characters: some louder, others slower, some seemingly on virtuoso auto-pilot, others played as if the pianist has momentarily lost himself in euphoria. Jan's put real thought into crafting a version that conjures interpretations and stories.<br /><br />Throughout the disc, there's a quiet and quite beautiful dignity and restraint in Jan's Chopin. He declines to inflate the music to its emotional limits, let alone the histrionic extremes to which some pianists have been guilty of taking it. Where others sing Chopin's melodies in assured, gorgeous cantabile, Jan sings them with introspection, sometimes hesitancy. The keyboard is banged only judiciously. I'm reminded of a quote by Glenn Gould: \\"[Some music] wears its heart on its sleeve. It seems to say, ''Please take note: This is Tragedy.\\" It doesn't have the dignity to bear its suffering with a hint of quiet resignation\\". In this and other ways, Jan seems an heir to some of Gould's key ideas. In a promo video for this disc, Jan talks about \\"adjust[ing the music]... to our reality and our times\\". I'm unsure if this means changes to the actual sheet music, or just disregarding tempo markings, but whatever he did, I hope he pushes it even further inthe future.<br /><br />This is 21st century Chopin, and -- without saying \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" in comparison to the beloved masters who've come before -- Jan's is a welcome and exciting new perspective.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|On a remote and frozen planet far beyond the boundaries of the Radchaai Empire, the lone figure calling herself Breq draws nearer the completion of a quest for vengeance twenty years in the making. Twenty years earlier the Justice of Toren was a mighty troop carrier, one of the largest ships in the Radchaai navy. Her AI controlled and monitored the actions of the entire ship as well as the host of \\"ancillaries\\" that serve her human officers as aids, servants or soldiers as the occasion demands. Spread across the stars, the Radchaai Empire has been built on the metaphorical backs of ships like Justice Of Toren and the ancillaries they command. Annex a system, integrate them into the Empire, grant citizenship to those deemed worthy (i.e. \\"pure\\" humans), then seize a portion of the population to be converted into ancillaries-corpse soldiers, as they are referred to by resentful annexees. Suitable human bodies are placed into cryostorage, ready to be revived, given implants and slaved to their ship's AI as readily expendable troops, flawlessly-coordinated and for all intents and purposes an extension of the ship. Twenty years ago, Justice Of Toren was one such ship with millenia of service behind her, orbiting a newly-annexed world notable only for being the final addition to the Empire, until an unthinkable betrayal tore it all away. Now Justice Of Toren lives on only as a fragment of herself, the ancillary One-Esk Nineteen, now known as Breq. She does not understand why everything she once was has been stripped away, not completely, but she does know who is responsible-Anaander Mianaai, the immortal Empress of the Radch. She must pay. But how does one kill an enemy that occupies a thousand bodies spread across the stars? And why does Breq keep risking her life and her mission to help Seivarden Vendaai, an officer who served on her a millenia ago? She herself cannot answer that question, not even to her own satisfaction. She only knows that her course is set. There's no turning back now, not when she is so close to her goal. May the cast fall as it will....<br /><br />In conception alone, this is probably the single most original piece of science fiction I have ever had the intense pleasure of reading. Leckie creates a meticulously-imagined world to explore, filled with fascinating characters that walk the line between the familiar and the completely alien, all conveyed with a sparsely elegant prose that somehow manages to put you inside the mind of an interstellar warship. This was an incredibly ambitious novel, and I was completely blown away by how well executed it was. If I hadn't visited the author's website myself (it's here, by the way, in case you're interested) I would in no way believe that this was her first novel. I would even go so far as to say that it is dang near perfect. I wouldn't change a thing about the book itself, save one sentence I found that got mangled in restructuring-probably fixed in the release version, since I'm reading an ARC. I do think the book would benefit from an author's note at the beginning regarding one artistic choice she made, but I'll discuss that in a minute.<br /><br />It's no secret that writing in first-person can be incredibly difficult; many times you are faced with the impossible choice of either breaking form to convey vital information about goings-on somewhere other than where your POV character happens to be, or leaving said information untouched. The Hunger Games ran into this a few times, I thought, and the films are really benefitting from their ability to show President Snow discussing why things happen the way they do. In this book, however, the author manages to pull an end-run around the issue. In the present, there's no need to cut away-Breq is alone, or Seivarden is with her. Either way, everything important happening centers on her. In her flashbacks explaining how she came to be in her position, she's an AI with eyes everywhere there's an ancillary, ship's camera or sensor. This allows the author to write in first person omniscient for those sequences, which I'm not sure I've ever seen done before. We the reader can sometimes be mystified by a secondary character, can be left wondering why they said or did something, but this is okay because we're seeing them through Breq's eyes, and she is just as mystified as we are! This is especially confusing during the pivotal moment in Breq's flashbacks where everything hits the fan and we learn just what happened, again because she doesn't completely understand it herself. It is very apparent, however, that Leckie understands these things, and in time all will be revealed. This book isn't actually out yet, it releases October 1st of this year from Orbit press. I have no idea how wide their reach is, so I don't know whether you'll have to go on Amazon to get it (here's a link!) or if you'll be able to pick it up at your favorite bookstore. However, I cannot emphasize enough how much you need to read this!<br /><br />My one suggestion: an author's note regarding the use of gender language throughout the book. The Radchaai language has no gender, so it's not part of Breq's \\"native thinking\\" to use gender-specific terms in her own head. All well and good, kudos for consistency, but I spent a good five minutes trying to figure out if it was a typo that Seivarden was referred to as \\"she\\" despite having been said to be male. (Ships are female, so everyone is \\"she.\\") It works, it's just a little confusing at the start. Certain characters, I still have no idea what their gender was. That's ok, just....confusing. Most of the cast is female in my head, probably more than should be.<br /><br />Thanks and disclaimers: I received an advance reading copy (ARC) of this book for free through the ARCycling program with the understanding that I would review it. Basically, the idea is that people who get free copies of these books in order to generate reviews and publicity will pass their copies along toother bloggers (or anyone else who fit the profile-see their site for details) in order to better serve this purpose and spread the word. Its a great program, and I owe them (and the donator, of course!) thanks for getting this into my hands. I had seen ads for it, and thought it would be an interesting read, but it wasn't a very high priority until I saw it on the list of offerings. I don't know for sure who donated this one, but I seem to remember seeing The Little Red Reviewer credited when I requested it.<br /><br />CONTENT: Language, R-rated but not gratuitous. Violence, occasionally gory, plus the whole concept of the ancillaries is a bit unsettling-especially the scene where they thaw out a new body and have to link it into the network. Some sexual innuendo, nothing explicit.
140006922X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The historical perspective of Jesus' life has provoked new thoughts on the foundation of my faith and Church.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie had respected actors and some well done visuals effects.  The plot was well thought out and the script was well done.  Gore isn't my &#34;Hot Button&#34; but this one was reasonable in the gore factor.  Not to gruesome but not too vanilla either.  The topic as far as virus was concerned, was very believable however the Zombie factor was a but far fetched.  All-in-all a pretty darn good movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this story from front to back and could not put it down for a day and a half.  Great story

B0013XW2F4|5.0|This is a bucket list must read.  There is historical content that is confronting. The history of forensic detective work is fascinating. Knowing that there are passages that are used in speech therapy from these works is worth remarking upon. Overall, total edification.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun puzzle game that's not too difficult.  I thought the levels would get harder but they never really did.  I buzzed through the levels pretty quickly.  Overall, a good FAOTD.
B00FFJN6SE|5.0|Ever since I plunged into Replica I've been curious as to how Lopatin could possibly follow that masterpiece up. Whereas Replica was beautifully sad, R Plus Seven is more optimistic, albeit scary at times. Seemingly random, this album is much more sample-reliant, something I like. That isn't to say there isn't drone and ambiance. There's plenty but this is most definitely a departure in a great way. Anybody who grew up in the 80's and 90's will be hit with nostalgia you can't quite pin down but this is also a very futuristic album. In a way, it's also more musical, using what I think are keyboard and/or actual samples of trumpets, contrabass, organ, bells, windflutes and much more. There's also a good deal of nature sounds, especially water. This gives the album a more wild, even tropical feel that adds to the scatterbrained approach. While it is forward thinking, it isn't cold like Replica. I daresay this will be a polarizing classic of electronic music. Get it now, even if you hate it, it's an adventure you won't soon forget.
141694737X|4.0|I got this for variety. Every page has a little flap with an animal hiding underneath. Its a small, fairly simple book but my 2 year old neice seems to get a big kick out of lifting the flaps over and over.
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|I thought it was like google earth, but it never responds. It's actually wikimaps that doesn't work. At least it's free.
0811879542|5.0|This book is a fun book which instructs the child to turn the pages and it seems the dots are doing things, so its very creative and interactive. I got this for a 2 year-old but after seeing it, I think this would be geared toward someone a little older. She doesn't quite get the concept of this one yet.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Do you have the Weber Smokey Joe?  If you do, this is the chimney starter to get!  It makes lighting charcoals very easy _without_ lighter fluid or any extras other than some paper or kindling scraps.  Just place some paper in the bottom, fill with charcoals (20-25 coals) then light the paper from underneath.  In no time, you'll have a nice BBQ going.  This is a very compact unit and easy to fit into a drawer or where-ever you store the grilling items, it's smaller than the weber smokey joe that it's intended to be used with.  Definitely recommended!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This film assumes it's audience is so clueless that it has to exaggerate everything.  The first hour's busy choppy editing and overbearing music requires choppy stacatto dialogue.  Nick is made into a childish sycophant.  Daisy barely exists outside of how others manipulate her.  The final chapter looks too morose in terms of cinematography, colors, and lighting.  Why not shoot real mansions instead of CGI and use 35mm instead of digital?  I always found \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" his best novel about money and desires.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|It is nice to see someone in the medical community focusing on food and not drugs.  I hope this starts a new trend!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great tower defense game. Easily one of the best I have ever played. Perfect for the kindle. I highly recommend it
B008Y212PI|5.0|Good challenge for the brain and fun at the same time. Good puzzle game to get you thinking, but not to hard.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm so ready for the next book..please hurry!!! I love this series I could not put it down. Great on the kindle.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I returned to Mr. Grisham's book because I started loving his writing after reading the first book of the horror of ways in which people treat one another over their own belief system of right and wrong!  This one did not disappoint.
B005HT400A|5.0|With all the hundreds of reviews of the film itself, there is nothing more I can add to those. It's a film classic. But what makes this version so great for me is the 50 minutes of lost footage and the extensive interviews with the primary cast members (including Dennis Hopper, r.i.p.), with David Lynch, with Dino De Laurentiis (r.i.p), and with  many of the creative production/technical people who assisted in the making of this awesome film.<br /> The disk includes the theatrical release and an unrated version. Both versions plus the extras are on one disk. I did not get to see this on the big screen when it was released, and saw it for the first time on a rented VHS tape in the late 80s. Thank you Sony for the Blu Ray format!<br /> It is inspiring to be able to see into so many creative minds. The detail level on the Blu Ray is incredible. If you are a student, a photographer, a stage, film, or video producer/director, a musician, or an actor, you will learn a lot from the interviews. And you will possess a wonderful piece of entertainment.  This movie was filmed in Wilmington, NC. The name of the town in the film is Lumberton, based on an actual NC town of that name about a hundred miles away from Wilmington.

0143119419|5.0|There is no hesitating how informative this book was. I usually reread sections of a book after I am finished with its entirety. But in this case I found myself rereading 3 specific sections even before I booked the book. To a novice: who or what is a hedge fund? To the youthful financier: should I be a hedge fund be or not? how did hedge funds even come to be? To the industry mocker: should hedge funds be or not? Read on I say, read on!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel is exquisite...complex...emotionally evocative and unforgettable. I am drawn to a sense of place,  the complicated relationships which are expertly expressed with nuance and compassion.
B00000K2W1|5.0|I have all of these titles on LP's, but I had nothing from Janis on CD. Everything on this CD is classic. Not a bad tune on the whole thing. Brings back memories of a by gone era - I love it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|If you like fantasy then this would be a good book to buy. If you liked the Percy Jackson series or the hunger games you would like this.
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor even though he doesn't stand up for American's 2nd Amendment Constitutionally guaranteed rights (which makes him a bit of a hypocrite). This movie is action packed, conspiracy riddled and revengefully fun. Before I get politically incorrect and become a target, I'll leave it at that. After all this is just fiction - right? Big brother IS watching so be careful about exercising your 1st Amendment rights. Or you too might become a target. ;)
0670024856|5.0|This was my first time reading Elizabeth Gilbert--I'm one of the six people in the universe who didn't read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\"--and I'm glad I didn't approach this novel with any preconceived ideas. I'm sure it's nothing like her previous bestseller, but if that book can propel this book high on the lists that would be great. \\"The Signature of All Things\\" is a lovely novel, beautifully written with great scope and rich characters.<br /><br />The novel is full of small delights of writing. Money, Gilbert writes, follows Alma's father around \\"like a small, excited dog.\\" The nineteenth century enchantment with science and the natural world is expressed fully and with the sense of wonder Alma and her family felt. Alma is educated in the 19th century way by her autodidact botanist father Henry and her classically educated Dutch mother, who want her to be able to understand the world on many levels. She does, and she doesn't.<br /><br />Where the novel falters is in the secondary characters, notably Alma's adopted sister Prudence and their friend, Retta. Both characters are meant to offer contrasts to Alma's cerebral, carnal aspects, but as people they are not believable, nor are their marriages. The novel becomes a little unmoored--as does Alma--once she leaves White Acres for the greater world. These are strange false steps in an otherwise assured work.<br /><br />But you know what? Who cares! It might take a little suspension of disbelief in the last third or so of \\"The Signature of all Things\\" but each page is still a pleasure and otherwise it might just be too perfect. May this quality novel have the success of Elizabeth Gilbert's other books. It would be nice to see it at the top of the NYT bestseller list.
B001383XT8|1.0|I bought this pedal based on all of the reviews and the great price, but it was a mistake. I was very excited to receive the pedal and when I did, I was extremely disappointed.  I knew it was plastic and that didn't bother me, but it's extremely cheap plastic. I tried using a 9V battery with it and the cable that connects to the battery is very cheap and you have to jiggle the batter around a lot for the pedal to turn on. Also, the actual pedal to turn the effect &#34;on or off&#34; doesn't do anything. The distortion was always on. I would spend an extra $25 and get a better quality pedal. I sent mine back the same day.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I saw this concert on PBS and fell in love with the vocals and instrumentals of both the Stones and Muddy Waters.  Great performance from two energetic bands.

B009CF7JDU|3.0|Fun movie.  You end up rooting for him, even though he is totally bucking the system.  And you end up rooting for his buddy, too.<br />Love the Ferrari.  It is not, however, a great statement or anything like that.  Just fun.  Good sister character.
B00EBDXSOW|5.0|I recently got into Metallica, and so I'm obsessed with finding everything they have done. This is an older album, but it's amazing. I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun, fun, fun.  So very addictive. Great graphics.I have to force myself to stop playing and get some work done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have been playing this game for way too many hours and have enjoyed every minute.  The animation is bright and fun, and the action is smooth.  I have also been able to keep leveling up without spending any real money.  Great fun!
B008D28HYS|3.0|It's fun and challenging at first but once you get the hang of it- it's simple! Still entertaining though! Cool for free!
B008Y212PI|4.0|love it.  fun, addictive, and best of all,  free!  I do recommend it.  makes you think.  cant think of more words,
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|So interesting to be out among the rough animals and still being safe at home.  Baby Elephant Walk music is our favorite! The DVD was great, good picture and sound.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I like that you can switch to different shapes.  I've tried several different ones and enjoyed most of them.  A couple of them you could only make one or two moves and that ended it but other then that its fine.

B007SGM084|5.0|I have read this trilogy several time gets better every time. I am hoping for another book to be added to the trilogy.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|, Very functional,  very practical and easy on use. Setting up is very intuitive and easy to do. Easy to use when you are tired.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a really fun game. Played one on my computer like this. Works great on my Kindle fire. Trying to get my son to play. Makes you use your brain, and I'm all for that. Going to get the others.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great tutorial with this so now I understand the puzzle. I love this! It's addicting.  I just did all the beginner puzzles and now I'm going to try the ten by ten size.  I look forward to playing this each evening after kits go to bed. Great wind down game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|worth the wait.  great product for really cheap price.  brought it on my vacation and it is my instance movie center.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Seen Joe on Cable TV one afternoon and was amazed.  Who is this guy I asked myself, someone who has loved music since 1978, I was impressed.  This double CD is nothing short of amazing.  A solid 10.;

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was like visiting and old friend and getting caught up.  This is true Stephen King with a satisfying ending.  I have read all his books and this one will stand now forever in my top five of my all time favorites.  King's writing style always leaves you on the edge of your seat and you can't put it down, even if it's 3:30am and you have to wake up in a couple of hours to go to work.  You have to read the next page.  Taking us through Dan \\"doc\\" Torrance's life from the little boy that left the Overlook, makes you sad, hurt for him and cheer him on!  Well done Stephen King, well done!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I'm a Hay House fan, and have read heaps of books from Rhonda Byrne to Wayne Dyer and Deepak Chopra. But this book is my pick of the hundreds I've read in the last decade. Simple, practical, funny. And it works!
B00103584Y|5.0|High intensity...great for even the people that gripe about reading subtitles. Very good pick for a movie night with discussion.
B00DJZR46G|2.0|It is hard to say something negative for a singer/song-writer who is likely one of the most important musicians ever lived. If he retired any year after 1975, this would still be true.<br />I'll be brief, this album has some OK songs here and there, has more strength in lyrics, and overall it is better than many of his mid period albums. However, those albums, i.e. the ones in the 80s or early 90s, had at least one or two songs that you would want to listen again, remember later on, and well, sometimes they would be hit singles somewhere in the world. I hear nothing like that here. I know I talk like a music industry guy, saying \\"there are no hit singles here,\\" but there are no hit singles here. In fact there are no mildly memorable songs here. I'll give it a few more try and re-vise this.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|i have had this movie nearly 2 year's now,and have never finished watching it. It was Just to Creepy fer me,Like somethang fer Trick r treat time Spooky. I only part,that i was wanting to see is where mila kunis is giving Natalie Portman,some oral lesbian sex,and the way,that that came about even creeped me out. Trying to sufficate her w/that pillow afterwards. I wouldn't watch this again.
B008Y212PI|3.0|not bad. ok free app of the day probably would not spend money on it. ok time waster. ok ggraphics and control
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I loved the book, so naturally bought this when I heard about it.<br />Peter, Enchantment and Stardust is a beautiful collection of poetry inspired by Peter: A Darkened Fairytale. The book is broken into parts. My favourite part is Enchantment: Trice a darkened widow/ Touched my shadow/In night While sleeping. Following this intriguing sub-heading are poems that took me right back to the book. The reason this section of poetry is my favourite is because it was darker and enchanted my darker side! The poem I loved the best was Devil's Wish. It filled my mind with wonderful often unnerving images. Such lines like: Matured crow's feet/Fairies die/Mad dog's liver/An innocent's lie, sum up the dark magic of the author's world. I love poems. I love fairytales. This book delivers. I'll be reading it to my nephews, they'll love it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I normally only play hidden object and adventure games, but since this was the free app of the day, I gave it a try. Wow! I have a new game fave! The puzzles are challenging but not too hard, and they build beautiful scenes.
B00A3OT34M|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  I love Pit bull, but use it primarily for working out or walking.  This is a very high energy CD.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of Final Fantasy, so naturally I had to pick up this movie. I've not watched it on Blu-Ray as of this review, so keep in mind that my words may not hold true for that version. The animation was crisp and clear, and super detailed. You could see down to the sweat drops of the characters during fight scenes. The story also brought a nice sense of... closure, I guess, to the world of Final Fantasy VII. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes anime, over-the-top fight scenes, Final Fantasy VII, gravity defying hair, or big swords!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A very nice read,  I suggested that my wife read it.  A very interesting twist to bring the various story lines together.  I would rate the book as very good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|REALLY GOOD SECOND BOOK OF THE TRILOGY, BETTER THAT THE FIRST BOOK. IT REALY MADE YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE STORY.
0440236304|1.0|Heard my grandfathers D-Day story was told in Burgetts book so i bought it and read it. Let me say my Grandfathers account of his capture by the Nazi's is totally different than what the books says, its just really sad the truth was not told because somebody wanted to sell books. In honor of my great American HERO Private Nicholas A. Distasi 101st 506 Able Company Sniper & American POW i give this book a 1 star. I will spare the public the details out of respect for the Unit.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|THE THIRD BOOK WAS MY FAVORITE BUT MADE ME SAD WHEN IT ENDED. IT LEFT TOO MANY ENDS OPEN WITHOUT ANOTHER BOOK TO IMMEDIATELY GO TO IN ORDER TO TIE THOSE ENDS UP---CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXTR INSTALLMENT.
1476727651|2.0|I, like many other commenters here have always been a Stephen King fan.<br /><br />That said, I am shocked, as this book is a crime against humanity. The plot might appeal to some 13 year old girls, but other than that, I don't see any appeal here.<br /><br />This felt like a Steven Seagall movie, where there is no suspense, the bad guys do something bad, and then the good guys kick the bad guys asses straight through the whole movie.<br /><br />The issue here has nothing to do with it being a sequel. Even a sequel can have a good, convincing story. This is just terrible. Terrible.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's not a bad game, slightly boring &amp; easy on the 5x5 levels.  hoping it gets tougher and more challenging.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|This was a fun, quick read.  I enjoyed it for the story itself, but if you are looking for a deep read, this is not.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I had heard a lot about the movie, nothing specific, just that it was a great movie, great stars.  I liked the movie! I did not realize it was about mental illness and it made me see life a little different. Thank you.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|I like this game, but when your stuck and you have no coins and don't want to buy anything, your kind of forced too buy it or quit
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son plays this game all the time.  He loves the different locations it gives.  Updating the software is a snap.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theaters, the entire audience applauded when it was over. Beautiful photography, amazing acting and I believe the profound message of the book&#34;s author was captured and conveyed
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My son enjoyed this so much and it's the third time he has seen it.  Great movie for kids and adults.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|so love it I just love star wars huge fan like angry birds I love it combined so fun to play.  poop
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This movie is magic. It transported me to a time when I was a child, filled with wonder and bursting to acquire new experiences that would tickle my imagination. As an adult, it's much rarer that I might find something that fills me with such delight - but King Kong did it for me. This is a first-rate adventure tale with everything I could hope for. A lost island, filled with prehistoric beasts and monsters, a fascinating cast of characters (special recognition for Jack Black), and of course, the giant ape himself (marvelously realized by the motion capture of Andy Serkis). I realize special effects aren't everything, nor do they make a movie... but in this movie, those special effects really are SPECIAL, pulling off some incredible imagery that made my heart race and my eyes bulge. When I was watching King Kong battle with multiple T-Rexes, I immediately decided that I needed to acquire a larger TV, this spectacle was so awesome. More importantly, none of it ever stands out as being \\"fake\\" or overly CGI- it blends in perfectly, which to me is the sign of artists who take great pride in their work. This is one of the best adventure movies I've ever seen, if not the very best, and one that should delight imaginative viewers of all ages.
B00DJZR46G|1.0|I patiently waited for this CD for months but read this ONE star review and now am undecided. Louie<br />My rating will change if I ever listen to it.  This rating is based on the following reviewer's notes.<br /><br />Elton John<br />The Diving Board<br />(Capitol *)<br /><br />Look out below! Sir Elton wobbles off the Diving Board, his first new release in seven years. From the stiff, old-timey opening salvo, \\"Oceans Away,\\" to the ghastly gospel of \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" this collection never finds its stride. It's difficult to tell what era John was shooting for with producer T Bone Burnett. Suffice it to say this is more parlor music than pop. Even the livelier tunes, such as \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\" end up sounding vacant, like background music in a movie scene. Falling, not diving.<br /><br /> - David Hiltbrand<br />  Philly.com
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I was saturated with information about flowers and their history but the story was very good.  I felt for this girl and hoped it would turn out good for her.  Well written and not easy to read
B008KYOCA2|4.0|OK, considering that this is NOT what I was looking for...I really like it a lot!  The calender app that came on my Kindle Fire was good, but I do not always have wi-fi.  I wanted a basic calender that I could input appointments on, without needing to sync with my email.  At first, I thought that this app has \\"more\\" than what I wanted, but it was the best free calender that I could find at the time, so I tried it.  Boy was I ever surprised to see how EASY it is to use!!!  All of my appointments are right where I can see them.  It has cute little icons that help me see what is going on with just a glance.  I have in putted all birthadays and anniverseries, etc...it is great!!  The only reason that I did not give this app 5 stars, is that I thought that it should have had a few more \\"practical\\" icons...like a tooth for dental appointments, or a stethescope for doctor appointments, etc.  I recommend this app for anyone that is looking for a basic, easy to use calender.
B00FF56IR4|1.0|Acting sucked big time and the plot is horrible. The Pilot is meant to hook you, this show will get pulled in no time. Is bad for the Marvel Comics brand to put out something so incredibly sucky.
B008Y212PI|5.0|VERY ADDICTING! Just a simple game but couldn't put it down. Good way to kill time. Makes you think the whole time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|How could you leave me on such a high... Lol- I know... I'm seriously hooked and can't wait for the next novel in this amazing series!!! I seriously couldn't put it down!!!! Fingered crossed this will be made into a movie... ;) it has such an amazing story line!!! I sure hope the new novel's release date comes soon!!!!!
B00800WIK2|5.0|A geek with nostalgia is a very fun idea indeed. The idea of a mini game cabinet takes us back to when we could go to the theatre, mall, or the arcade itself and play those sweet glowing stands of pure joy!<br /><br /> This is a great little unit for your iPhone/iPod to play games on.<br /><br />I, currently, only have three games available to me on this cabinet:<br /><br />Space Invaders (super fun),<br /><br />Pong (classic), and<br /><br />Asteroids (difficult, but fun anyway).<br /><br />This is worth the money! Honestly, I think this is a great little option if one cannot find a Gameboy or other gaming console, this does fine just by itself.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the perfect device for house parties or get-togethers.  We have this plugged into our television, so when friends are over, we can create our own custom playlists of items from YouTube or easily search Netflix for a movie to watch.<br /><br />Currently, all this can really do is connect to YouTube and Netflix, but for $35 the Chromecast is well worth the purchase.
B000H5U832|5.0|The Movie itself is is a great ride (pun intended)<br /><br />the rides at disneyland inspired from this movie are even better.<br /><br />Great Disney/Pixar flick
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Most addictive game ever! And all the family loves playing it! Great entertainment for everyone. You should definitely give it a try.

B008Y212PI|4.0|As stated elsewhere, the graphics could use a bit of updating, so could the sound, to be perfectly honest. Other than that, its a wonderful distraction. Played it all night while I was sick and couldn't sleep. Kept me busy and my mind off my misery. What more could you ask from an app?

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I actually use this to jot down everything, while on the commuter train or while reading in bed. It's great!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|What a refreshing change from the cardboard characters and story lines that usually inhabit a teen romance.  This book is funny and sad and I just fell in love with Eleanor & Park.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|The battle between good and evil or light and dark is as old as humanity itself. Some of the best myths and stories circle around that idea. This movie taps into that primal power, but yet in a modern and refined way. The story twists and turns through a labyrinth of emotions and perceptions in just the right way to shed some light, yet keep you in the dark. The clash between sane and insane can be felt throughout the movie, which exemplifies the contrast between the two. Overall, I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes psychological thrillers. My only disagreement with it is the graphic scenes involving fingernails, but don't let me discourage you. Go ahead and see for yourself!
B000003TAB|5.0|The edgier Nirvana we didn't hear on &#34;Nevermind&#34; surfaces on &#34;Incesticide,&#34; an assortment of pre-&#34;Nevermind&#34; singles and other material that was circulating among the fan community prior to its release. Rawer than their major label debut and yet poppier in spots than &#34;In Utero,&#34; this album lives somewhere in the ether between both of those outings. Crucial moments include the radio-ready &#34;Sliver,&#34; Vaselines' cover, &#34;Molly's Lips,&#34; and the brutal &#34;Aneurysm,&#34; which is easily one of the best songs these guys ever recorded. Fun listening for casual fans; absolutely essential for the devotees.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|In 2012, Haim (or HAIM, as it is sometimes stylized) released an EP, because well, if you're gonna tour with Mumford & Sons, you better bring something to sell. Their EP, Forever, is only three tracks long (I'm not counting that remixed track, are you?), but it was enough to create considerable buzz. And what's there not to be buzzed about? Three young sisters, making music that sounds like an updated Fleetwood Mac, equipped with synthesizers, guitars, and three-part harmonies? Sign me up! Their debut full-length record, Days Are Gone carries high expectations for a band that's so likeable and promising that some have heralded them as The Next Big Thing*<br /><br />So part of why Haim is receiving all of this buzz is because of who they are on paper; the other part is because of how they sound on record. The Haim sisters resist being pigeonholed in any particular genre because they frequently shift between styles between songs. One song they're shelling out melodramatic synthpop like Au Revoir Simone or Chvrches (&#34;Days Are Gone&#34;), others have them laying down dark, urbanite rhythms (&#34;My Song 5&#34;), some with 90's influenced R&B (&#34;Falling&#34;), and guitar-centric pop (&#34;Let Me Go&#34;). Fans of the band will instantly recognize two of the three songs that appeared on Forever -- &#34;Forever&#34; and &#34;Go Slow&#34; show up on the album with only slight alterations to the production. So if you were early to board the Haim Train (tm), Days Are Gone will offer up enough new material to please; if you're new to the band, well, now there's one less EP** you have to listen to.<br /><br />Portishead's Geoff Barrow said about the band: &#34;Haim sound like Shania Twain ... When did that become a good thing?&#34; And he's right. &#34;The Wire&#34; does sound eerily like Twain's pseudo-feminisit power anthem &#34;Man, I Feel Like a Woman&#34;. Haim lay down plenty of style to cover up the conventional melodies and tropes that other (usually frowned-upon) bands employ. Fleetwood Mac is often used as a point of comparison for Haim and the music of Days Are Gone, and the similarities go beyond the Knicks-esque vocals and harmonies; Fleetwood Mac was a pretty safe, standard band. They had basic melodies and basic harmonies (and they knocked these things out of the park). Haim is much the same, so while some of the sounds particular to Days Are Gone sound new, they very much carry an old, traditional foundation. In theory, that could be a boon for the band - changing up a genre just enough yet remaining faithful to their roots - but it just comes across as slightly stale. Once you look under the hood of this shiny Corvette, you'll find that these are parts borrowed from a Honda Civic.<br /><br />Haim works brilliantly on paper, and as an idea, they're incredibly exciting. Their debut, Days Are Gone doesn't bring to life the possibilities that are promised by this band's ingredients or their EP. However flimsy this debut might be, I'm not giving up the ghost on Haim being a massive success - I think that they have the charisma, the talent, and the resources to make a great record. Days Are Gone will make your mouth water with its glossy sheen and candy-like veneer, but it won't leave you full. After this record, you'll be left with the strange feeling of wondering why're you're still so hungry.) bands employ.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|much better than I thought it would be. Not the normal Matthew with his shirt off chick flick stuff. Kids were great actors
B008Y212PI|5.0|Pretty good game if you enjoy puzzles and need some time to kill. The puzzles are interesting and cute to look at when completed.
B00985E3UG|5.0|It gives much detail about how the food industry makes money, by geting people addicted to their foods. It is excellant!
B004YXE438|5.0|This game is fun, the puzzles can be played at lots of different levels allowing them to be played according to how much of a challenge is wanted. There have been no glitches on my Kindle Fire. Highly recommended!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This is a great movie. We enjoyed it immensely! I recommend it highly. I don't know why it didn't do well in the theaters but its worth the purchase.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Great show, I always enjoy the characters. The quirky red haired attorney is stealing this season. Cannot wait to see the whole season.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game if you don't like it you can get rid of it but it is so great
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|So maybe I'm getting a bit slower now that I'm in my 40's, lol, but I didn't have the correct twist in mind in this novel, so it made it much more enjoyable when the secret was revealed.  I enjoyed the characters, the story line and the way it wove.  I really enjoy stories with a moral dilemma of sorts, and this was a slightly less current dilemma they face, but a \\"what would you do\\" situation nonetheless.  It was well worth my time and the $6 or so I paid for the Kindle Edition.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Enjoy the characters and getting the band back together comment by Morgan Freeman who is in everything, if you haven't noticed and probably getting close to the richest man on earth, don't you think?....Bruce Willis does it all and the ageless and feminine yet deadly Helen Mirren...fantastic...have Red 2 on order...hope they make Red 3 as well....
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very enjoyable.  My ten year old grandson enjoys helping play this logic game.  Great way to pass time and sharpen logic skill.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Excellent movie...still can't believe the casting in this and the prior one...also having Leonard Nimoy appearing in both was brilliant and the reversal of roles near the end to save the Enterprise and kind of a &#34;:Back to the Future&#34;  &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; type event....also brilliant!
B008Y212PI|5.0|a great way to pass the time.  some puzzles are pretty easy but I like the challenging ones. lots of fun
B007ZXK08C|5.0|By far the best book I have read this year and I read a lot of books!<br /><br />Gillian Flynn leads you on a journey with her two main characters that lulls you into thinking that this is just another psychological thriller like any other until she drops in the jaw-dropping twist half way through that is like no other I have read. Absolute class and exactly what you want from a book in this genre of writing.<br /><br />Superbly written, insightful and very clever this is the must-read book of the year.
0920236251|4.0|We went to see the play of this and had to buy the book!  Did not realize the book was so small!  But great story!
0131103628|3.0|The book is a quick read, which is a plus. The code is often a little buggy, though. E.g., [...] The error is apparent if you work through a quick example. Makes you wonder if they did that just so you could get the full experience of buggy C programming.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is going to go down as one of their best. Like Power Windows and Moving PIctures. Their choice to create a series of songs that tell a story was a great idea and works very well. While the 'concept album' is often derided it isn't the concept album itself that is a bad idea but that most concept albums are poorly executed because they are very difficult to do well. Rush has created a 2112 for the 21st century, although they did not do a 20 minute song comprised of multiple movements but an album with many songs each conveying different parts of a journey from naive innocence to eye open.... well I won't put my spin on what I think the story is about. The songs are wonderful, and the use of full orchestra is done in a manner that enchances rather than distracts from the songs in which they are used. I recommend this album whole heartedly. I have been a fan since 1990 when a high school buddy first turned me on to Rush by loaning me Power Windows. I was blow away by both Geddy Lee's vocal range and his bass stylings, to say nothing of just how amazing the composition was and the fact that every instrument was 'the star' and blended together seamlessly to create.... okay this was supposed to be a review of the album, so I will stop gushing. If you like Rush, you'll love the album. If you are new to Rush, I think that you will find yourself a fan after a few listens.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Such big names....and what a crash. This movie could have been sooooo much more.<br />This really was one of those movies that you finished just to see the end. I'm sorry guys- I can't say that I hate things, but if one star didn't mean &#34;hate&#34;- this movie would have it
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|I didn't realize till the end why I was loving this movie.<br /><br />Its not an entirely complete story, not fully explained, its open.<br />Its a short story, or a novella.<br /><br />I read a lot of short story anthologies, I'm a huge fan. This is set up like them, and looking at it that way, I see how pretty damn awesome it is.<br />My mind is left open on purpose, a lots left up in the air, and so the titles even more appropriate.<br /><br />I hate sounding snobby, but its true what so much of the rest of the world sees Americans as, we expect a formula, and certain types of stories are the norm. Not all Americans, don't get me wrong. But too many loud and opinionated people see anything outside of what is their norm, as worth ripping apart. Movie goers themselves, nitpicking critics, a lot of people.<br /><br />Well this isn't made in the USA, its French/Canadian, and I'm glad.<br /><br />I loved it
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Had to finish it out. Really like all the characters and the people who play them- until now.<br />What were these bad guys?????<br />I know you can't do but so much..... But come on guys. This is how you close out iron man.<br />Yea- I know, tony stark will be back....but I hope with a better story

B00DJZR4A2|5.0|I really enjoy \\"The Diving Board\\" by Elton John.  The title song is the perfect song to relax to after a long hard day.  This is the first song dedicated to the graceful sport of diving. I admire Elton for including a song about my favorite sport on his album.  This song makes me wonder what thoughts go through the mind of a diver just before they perform a dive.  My other favorite song is \\"Oceans Away\\".  This song reminds me that there is always something to learn from my elders. \\"Home Again\\" is the other highlight on this album.  This is a song about trying to get back home after spending a life time of exploring the world.  This is a beautiful song lyrically and melodically. \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" is a song that puts me in a good mood.  This song is so uplifting.  This song is a reminder that I should strive to keep all aspects of my life clean and pure. I also love the song entitled \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\".  It is a rather pleasant song about feeling that time is not on my song.  I really like the lyrics of this song because I often feel lonesome.  I am hopeful that things will turn around for me though.  The song\\" entitled  \\"Mexican Vacation\\" (Kids In The Candlelight) has a delightful bluesy tone to it. This song captures Elton's joy of being a father and raising children.  \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" is an interesting song. This song motivates me to learn more about the life and writing career of Oscar Wilde.  I thank Elton John for raising my literary curiosity with this song. \\"The New Fever Waltz\\" is a gorgeous song.  I can actually picture myself dancing the waltz with a special woman to this song. Elton includes three instrumental piano pieces entitled Dream.  The first two dream instrumentals are soothing.  The last dream is so lively.  This short 97 second piece inspires me to make the most of each day that I am given. \\"The Diving Board\\" proves that Elton John is still a great singer and piano player.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app sucks. So when I get into YouTube and start to type and it says YouTube isn't working right now.so stupid don't get app.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game for all ages. Can't stop playing. Lol tons of levels like Facebook sign in. I Play for hour's.
B006P0FIGU|2.0|What an utter waste of talent. Truly, what a waste of a classic novel. It's too awful to even contemplate in depth, but it's pretty much a travesty. Despite the extremely talented cast, millions spent on special effects, a musical score clearly borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, beautiful costumes , and a well-known director, this version of The Three Musketeers is an epic failure. Logan Lerman is way too young to play D'Artagnan. He looks young, and he acts young. His \\"romance\\" with Constance is a joke; they are mistmatched beyond anything I've seen recently. Matthew Macfadyen plays Athos admirably, but his constant brooding nature gets tedious after a while, and he has very little else to do. Luke Evans is Aramis, and it would have been an excellent casting choice-if he stayed true to his novel character. Here, I have no idea whatsoever who he is supposed to be. Is he a priest? Does religion matter to him? Ray Stevenson is Porthos and I can't find any fault with his character. He is Porthos to me. Then there's Milla Jovovich as Milady. Cunning, beautiful, dangerous, and apparently a martial arts expert. Her role is so eye-roll inducing, I nearly stopped watching the movie because of her. Mads Mikkelsen as Rochefort is really good, but a bit cartoony. My big gripe is with Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu. This is a man who is supposed to inspire fear, a manipulative, evil sort of character who here is so utterly confusing and at times even a comic relief. Mind boggling. King Louis is useless here, acting like a spoilt, whiny child who is more concerned about the latest fashion than his own country's affairs. Orlando Bloom is the only one apparently having any fun here as the wicked Duke of Buckingham, but again it leads nowhere.<br /><br />This film is so disjointed and ridiculous I can't even be sure if we, the audience are supposed to take it seriously or what. The steampunk genre gets thrown at us at random and before you know it, you've forgotten what the actual plot of the film is. Oh yes, the perilous affair of the Queen's diamonds that the musketeers have to recover in London within a 5 day time period. Wow, I'm susprised the director even remembered to keep SOMETHING from the novel intact. I could nitpick this thing to death but it's not even worth the effort. I was so dissapointed as I was really looking forward to a newly updated, true adaptation. I guess I'll keep waiting.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Never had trouble with kik. But now I do it will take forever to load. Then says something's wrong. Nothing wrong. Please fix this
B00AEFYVUQ|4.0|One of Woody Allen's best movies which was actually based on a play.  I've only seen it at the show and that goes back many years.  Never found it on videotape and didn't know it was on disc anymore until I accidentally found it on Amazon.  If you've not seen it then you're in for a treat.  If you have seen it before then you can re-live the laughs that you'll surely get when viewing it again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I dig it...I can let my phone rest and wake up to the kindle instead.waking up to cool music and cool alarm sounds.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|For those who have not seen this film yet get out there and get it.  Get it in 3D.  The re-boot continues in this excellent second installment.  This is a thrill ride of big proportions and you won't be disappointed.  J.J. Abrams continues his excellent imagining of the young Starship crew and the adventures they encounter as they bond ever closer together as the crew we first met years ago.  Many thumbs up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to play this awestruck game it is so addicting I can't stop playing it I keep getting in trouble just for touching the kindle
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this show is instantly addicting! there is never a dull moment in this show, i am suprised that they can show such good drama without overdoing it and being innapropriate. i love this show.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Featuring Haynes, drummer Matt Abts, bassist Jorgen Carlsson and keyboardist/guitarist Danny Louis, Shout! is a diverse album. Its songs range from the punchy, new wave-inspired \\"Funny Little Tragedy\\" to the album-closing guitar jam of \\"Bring on the Music.\\"<br /><br />Two great discs, one by the band themselves and the second with a host of other great artists, among them are Dave Matthews, Steve Winwood, Jim James, Elvis Costello, Ben Harper, Grace Potter,Glenn Hughes, Myles Kennedy, Glenn Hughes and Dr. John to name a few.<br /><br />\\"For fans, the first disc has plenty of exciting material to offer, it sounds great, the writing is excellent, there are new musical directions, and, as expected, there is terrific playing throughout.\\"<br /><br />Gov't Mule still leads the way on disc two, but they let their friends take the vocal reigns for entirely different takes of their brand new jams.<br /><br />\\"No one's done this before, which is exciting,\\" says Gov't Mule's singer, guitarist and co-founder Warren Haynes in a statement. \\"But it's even more exciting actually listening to these artists sing our songs,\\" he continues. \\"Their performances bring new ideas, energy and sometimes even different meanings to every number.\\"<br /><br />This is the band's first album of new studio material in four years, marking the band's debut for Blue Note Label. And it is vintage Mule from A-Z.<br /><br />\\"We've always taken a non-traditional approach to everything we've done, and it works for us,\\" says Haynes. \\"One of things we're very proud of about this record is that all the songs stand up for themselves and have their own personality.<br /><br />I'm loving this new release as it stands tall amongst \\"The Mules\\" archives. That improvisational spirit is alive and well here where most of the pieces exceed five minutes with three over eight. It pushes the disc to nearly 75 minutes, the more \\"Mule\\" the merrier.<br /><br />Great release, good value for the money, 5 stars easily !
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I like that this series is available online from Amazon Prime.<br />I would recommend this show to any sci-fi enthusiasts.

B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Ancillary Justice is nothing if not ambitious.  The main character is the remainder of a self-aware starship capable of diffuse thought through dozens of reanimated human shells, the story takes place in parallel over two time periods, scenes sometimes switch between locations paragraph-to-paragraph, and the main society has very, um, different views on gender.<br /><br />In the present timeline, she is Breq, to outsiders seemingly human.  In the flashback timeline, she is Justice of Toren, a self-aware troop transport starship manned by human lieutenants and an army of reanimated human shells (called ancillaries, hence the title, or referred to derisively as corpse soldiers) that are also each her.<br /><br />Leckie has created a world that allows her to play around with gender extensively.  Not because she's created an escapist fantasy where inconvenient gender differences are ignored, but because she has used the possibilities of science fiction to change all the rules.  The Radchaii don't have gendered pronouns (the narrative used female pronouns) and evidently, through advanced science, blur biological gender lines freely (and Breq remains thoroughly confused by the idea).  But it's really language that Leckie is playing with, and it's the reader, not the characters, who is more effected.  It would be hard to overemphasize how much of a mind-screw it is to not know the gender of characters.  The mind keeps trying to shove characters into predetermined boxes, until finally it relents and admits it doesn't matter for the story Leckie is telling.<br /><br />Ancillary Justice is firmly in the space opera sub-genre, with self-aware starships whose engines burn hotter than stars, invisible guns, and internally stored armor.  There is an ice-covered planet and a swampy one.  The main society is a great human empire spanning galaxies, one formerly ever-expanding and now locked into an uneasy truce with powerful aliens.  One run by a single woman (man?) who discovered the key to power and immortality was cloning herself, each clone a genetically identical copy with a shared intelligence.<br /><br />Looking at the above I'm at a loss to explain it more clearly.  Ancillary Justice is a book that requires a lot of intellectual heavy lifting in the early going to fight through the gender thing, follow the story, put together the pieces, and get a handle on what's going on.  It's also far better than my own or any other explanation I've read makes it sound.  It's a Big Idea book: one with truly big ideas that are explored intelligently and insightfully (more Big Idea books fail at these than truly succeed).<br /><br />Disclosure: I received an advance copy of Ancillary Justice via NetGalley.he key to power and immortality was cloning herself, each clone a genetically identical copy with a shared intelligence.<br /><br />Looking at the above I'm at a loss to explain it more clearly.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|So many of my friends and family have urged me to read this book. I finally gave in with the upcoming movie in production. Christian is the classic romantic hero. Gorgeous, rich, mysterious with a dark side and a troubled past. Ana is a weak, insecure college girl who is seduced by the idea of what she wants Christian to be as opposed to who he actually is. The interaction and banter between Christian and Ana is definitely the saving grace of the book. Ana's general narration and introspective moments leave a lot to be desired and read as if told by a teenager. As a whole, the story is compelling and I definitely am interested to see where this couple ends up, however the journey getting there is bogged down by a lot of poor writing....
193700788X|1.0|i do not like the way it ended i have read all the books but the last one i just didnt get it
0307887448|5.0|This book was awesome.<br /><br />I was a kid in the 80's and I've played a lot of MMO's; as such, this book was easy to love.  It takes place largely inside the ultimate online world.  I won't rehash the plot, as it's already been described above and in other reviews.  Any good book is still about the characters, no matter how cool the setting, and Ready Player One is no exception.  The good guys are smart, flawed, brave, believable; the bad guys are ruthless and easy to hate.  No, it doesn't have the serious feel or prose of a book like Neuromancer - it isn't meant to.  For me, it was a very fun, fast-paced, highly enjoyable homage not only the 80's but also modern-day MMO's, and all this was wrapped around an adventure-laden love story.
B00EUS92EI|4.0|I was hooked on the first Natalia Kills album for a long time. From the first listen, I could tell that this was better in many ways. Natalia clearly displays a wider range of musical styles and works harder this time around. You can tell she's determined to add more to her show. That being said, Trouble, Stop Me & Controversy are clear standouts, but there are not as many tracks on this one that make me want to play it again. Marlborough Lights is unexpectedly good every time it comes on. I think this will take a bit longer to settle into that the more accessible Perfectionist and I'd be surprised if this does significantly better than her first album... but it certainly deserves to.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Made me want to be super careful in my life choices to not end up in that situation . It was very honest and told from the heart . I loved it !
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been on a Steven King read-a-thon lately. New(er) books like Under the Dome, things I'd missed along the way (Dead Zone), and re-reads of things I'd read when they were relatively new (Salem's Lot, Carrie and The Shining). In fact, I'd just finished re reading The Shining the day &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; was released on Kindle. I don't pay much attention to what goes on in the literary world and was surprised when I saw on the Kindle Store that Dr Sleep was a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;. How could I not make it my next read?<br />I'll let me 5-Star rating stand on its own as far as if I would recommend it or not. Suffice it to say I enjoyed it and would say Mr King is still at the top of his game.<br /><br />My best description of this book would have to be (and no matter how this sounds, its is meant as a complement) that Dr Sleep appears to be an amalgam of Salem's Lot, Carrie, The Dead Zone with a very distinctive sprinkle of Monsters Inc thrown in. Perhaps its also a bit Mr King releasing one of his remaining demons.
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|Best book ever make more please<br />Make more!!!!!!!!!!!!! They where the best book i ever read so please make mire

B0001CNRSE|4.0|Normally, I am not a Jessica Alba fan.  Nothing against her, just not really a fan.  However, I love her in 'Honey'.  Not only do I find her character believable but she looks hott too.  Also, the story line is pretty great.

B009CF7GRY|3.0|Good remake of the original film and a pretty decent soundtrack. There seems to be a problem with Closed Caption, as it appear with a huge delay vs the image.

B000SEJHRA|5.0|I like the conversational tone of the book and would recommend it to any adult.  Easy to read and the short story format makes it a great choice for a quick read.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Google needs to do a little more work on this before I would consider it a good purchase.  The music ap doesn't work.  It starts to play but then drops out.  The movie ap works, but the quality sucks.  I haven't tried netflix or youtube.  I thought this device would stream directly from the phone or tablet, but it doesn't.  It only uses the phone/tablet as a psuedo remote and then it streams directly from the source (i.e. google play, netflix, youtube).  If you were planning on playing movies from your tablet or phone on your television as was I, stick to the cable for now.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is super helpful. As a college student, i rarely WANT to read after school, but the app makes it really convenient. I can read as I wait for class, ride the bus, or eat on campus without having to put yet another book in my already heavy bag.

B004P1JEXE|1.0|No, the story line is too loose and feels like it's going nowhere so I doubt that I will buy the next book.
B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|In my opinion, it's their worst album, but don't get me wrong, it's still a good CD, I still gave it 3 stars.  Seemed like to many tracks were repetitive and melodramatic like Beautiful War, but songs like 'Wait for Me' and 'Tonight' remind me of older KOL and balance it out.  The track that drives me the most nuts is 'Comeback Story' - I love the sound / melody but the chorus ... all I can think of is that stupid stupid Jack Handy 'Deep Thoughts' SNL saying \\"Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes.\\"  It ruins the song.  Still a pretty good CD.

B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|I really wanted to be happy that Trent came back after the Wave Goodbye tour, but just like that sequel film that you look forward to but then find yourself wishing that they had left the original alone, this album does that in so many sad ways, and you wished that Trent wouldn't have marred his legacy with an adult contemporary electro-jazzy sound.  Unfortunately, Trent has abandoned the style that created him, and not in a good way. I enjoyed someone's comment, in an earlier post, where they stated that this album has music without a story. I felt that it was simply a man and his electronic box (computer perhaps) mixing and claiming it to be something new, yet it is simply rehashed stuff. I worried when With Teeth came out because it sounded like Trent was drifting into the adult contemporary pop style. And boy is this album poppy and whimsical. In With Teeth at least he had \\"Beside you In Time\\" and \\"Right Where It Belongs,\\" which are still edgy compositions that are clear masterpieces like \\"La Mer,\\" \\"The Great Below,\\" \\"The Mark has Been Made,\\" \\"Complication,\\" \\"Ripe (with decay),\\" and \\"Just Like You Imagined\\" all from the Fragile album, an album that I consider to be Trent's masterpiece. Yes, Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine were also fabulous albums, and albums that defined NIN and the Industrial scene, but this album as many have mentioned, this album falls short and does not have the edge or rush that we have come to like and expect from Trent. If you thought that With Teeth was good, but it could have been better then I wouldn't bother with Hesitation Marks. I would have preferred if this album had been filled with music like Ghosts I-IV, but instead it is filled with low-key stuff that you would listen to on a road trip, relaxing, but I warn you that you may fall asleep. At least I can say that Reznor has not contributed anymore music that you can listen to while driving fast and angry anymore, for that grab Pretty Hate Machine, but if you want to picture what Trent plays for his boys to wind them down for the night get Hesitation Marks.

B000JQU1VS|1.0|I have notified Amazon by phone that I NEVER ORDERED this book!!! I don't understand why it is still on my purchase list!!!
B00E9P959O|2.0|Yes, this is a great remix. Yes, \\"Secret Touch\\" sounds fabulous. \\"Earthshine\\" and especially \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" are not painfully distorted anymore.<br /><br />But why should we pay full price for the band/producer/publisher essentially undoing a major mistake? Sorry but I simply can't believe that they were either unaware of or unable to fix the problems with the original pressing.<br /><br />This should be $5 tops.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book is a sensitive way to teach about euthanasia and other issues in our society. Although one of the first stories about a controlled society, still one of the best!
B00CO52NLI|1.0|My kids love this game they say  it is a great game and they each have there own side. My little girl oni say it is the best game in the universe. My other little girl aurora Mae says that it is not fun ,it is amazing (word 4 word ) they love it.
006082543X|5.0|Item arrived before the actual delivery date, awesome!!! I don't even know what happened to my copy of coraline but when I doid have this I read it over and over it's just like a comic book and I do love those. As I watched coraline go through so much I felt like I was there with her, but as I do all books I recommend this to anyone who likes reading.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I really don't know if I expect more of this app, but It didn´t impress me so I remove, it works but not so good for me
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|This is one of the best Luffy figures in existence. Displaying Luffy using his new red hawk attack imbued with Haki. The figure is as detailed as it can get. The luffy itself is made of hard, sturdy plastic. All of the effect pieces are a softer rubbery plastic. This includes the blue smoke/clouds under Luffy's legs, the flames emanating from his fist, and the white cloud trails behind him.<br /><br />Figure comes with a Octagonal base stand that says \\"Monkey D Luffy Battle Ver.\\" and also some japanese words that Im guessing says Red Hawk attack or something. The base comes with two clear plastic rods to support the figure when its on the stand, but they are pretty much useless because the figure has bits that plug directly into the stand.<br /><br />This was my first one piece, and first figuarts figure. I have now made it my life goal to purchase every single One Piece Figuart figure!!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I've tried all the other diet plans and my body was just resistant. This one really works, but you have to follow the instructions thoroughly, and you have to drink the water!  I am starting week 5 and am half way to my goal.  I am encouraged by the reinforcement that once your goal is reached, they are still available to guide you to maintain that weight.  You are not left to your own defenses.  There are MANY recipes and options to prevent boredom, but eating out at restaurants can sometimes be a challenge.  You have to plan to bring your own food and do cooking ahead, a lot of the time.  But in the end it really works, and pretty fast, too.  I would recommend this to any chronic dieters or those with more than about 20 pounds to loose.  I think this is somewhat extreme for less than 20 pounds to loose.  Good Luck!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is more addictive than angry birds!  You're missing out if you don't download and play today!  My daughter and I are constantly challenging each other for high score.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this app is very fun. it works very good on my kindle fire. and this is good like i said lol but some of the question things are kinda hard but once you figure it out with the hints you feel silly because the answer was so easy
B008Y212PI|5.0|Such a good excersize for the brain. Sometimes it appears that the only move one has available is a guess- but after careful consideration the logical next move becomes evident. If you like logic puzzles, this is one for your collection!
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Ninety-nine cents!  Downloads fast, no glitches and best of all - NO HIDDEN OBJECTS!  The graphics are fine; the puzzles are suitably puzzling but not impossible.  The interface is intuitive, the inventory is labeled (and works on the first try!), the game is a good length.  Much like Fire Maple's previous games, this is as close to a perfect point and click that you will find.  Played on a second generation Kindle Fire and highly recommended.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I think Season One was the second best season.  Season 2 was the best, in my opinion.  This is a great show.
0525244581|2.0|not the way that pooh is... the author just does not understand pooh bear....a big thumbs down!  cold and removed!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love memory improving games and this is a great one. It really challenges your mind and your hand and eyes coordination.
B00447L4KA|5.0|If you like the movie, then you'll like this DVD. Comes wrapped in a plastic, and is a legit DVD movie just like you'd buy in a store. Shipped on time along with other items.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Have only played the first level but have enjoyed would recommend for all ages.  Helps seniors to keep your mind active.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I would recommend this app to anyone! Beatiful graphics, realism and more. 5 out of 5 stars without a doubt.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's a great movie and even better that you can watch it free thanks to amazon prime. I love the super hero movie thing and this movie fits the bill. It is long for a movie but that does not take away from how good it is. I definitely recommend watching it.
