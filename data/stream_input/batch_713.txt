078322933X|5.0|Witness the inner workings of a sociopath's mind. Witness the impact of that mind on those around him.<br /><br />This DVD is terrifying and suspenseful, and more realistic than some would suspect. I highly recommend that parents watch this film with their children. Not only does Fear have tremendous entertainment value, it could open the lines of communication and prevent a young woman from becoming involved with disturbed people such as this.<br /><br />Recommended very highly.
1596912855|3.0|I enjoyed the book and I was unable to predict the ending, which I always like. However, the story appears to have been written in such a way that it could easily be adapted for a TV movie.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Pure art. Classic film reminding me of the old classics that were on VHS that you won't ever be able to buy on DVD. Geniusly edidted and put together in first half kinda wished he continued style on second half. Tarantino again excels in dialogue.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The BBC Blu-Ray version with David Attenborough narrating is spectacular in video and audio and contains approximately 50 minutes more material than the US version (greed, in the form of commercials, was the difference, I heard).  As long as you can be comfortable hearing lengths, depths, and other distances using the metric system, this is the version for you.  The differences between the DVD and Blu-Ray versions (I own both) is also significant, as you'd imagine.  This is one of the reasons to own a Blu-Ray player.  If you buy nothing else, buy this Blu-Ray DVD...it'll be beautiful forever.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|....than the sum of its parts. Finally. A \\"greatest hits\\" album that really is....this is 75' 33\\" of absolutely the finest jazz singing around. If you're already a fan of Diana, you've probably got twelve of the fifteen cuts...you've Picked Yourself Up, Fallen in Love, and been Flown to the Moon. Still, it's nice to have them all together. There are even two cuts from \\"Live In Paris\\", complete with applause. Thanks, Diana, for including \\"Frim Fram Sauce\\", one of my personal favorites.<br /><br />If there's a weakness here, it's the three previously unreleased cuts...they are unused takes from earlier releases [the notes let us know which ones]...maybe there was a reason. Still, they aren't \\"bad\\", and it's always great to have something by Diana we haven't heard before.<br /><br />I am not an unbiased judge of Diana Krall; I flipped the first time I heard her voice, don't even bother to deny the crush my wife accuses me of, and buy all her albums the day they arrive in stores. 'S Wonderful. And, a lot of folks agree with me...get this, and hear why.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Bottom Line, Kanye put it DOWN! This CD is dope from front to back, my favorites are Good Morning, Champion, Can't Tell Me Nothing, Good Life, Flashing Lights, and Big Brother. Kanye keep representing the Chi! There's a lot of haters out there, but Chicago running it right now!
0316067598|5.0|I just finished this book last night.  This book transports you to Navy SEAL training as well as on the ground battles that bring very personal definition to headlines we read and hear every day.  But the real beauty of this finely written book is it transcends any current war or current events and consistently brings the reader into the heart and soul of a modern day warrior who exemplifies the best qualities of our country.  Whether a reader approves or disproves or has no opinion on the war and associated politics doesn't matter - what does matter is the moving account of our special forces making sacrifices for all of us back here -- with humility, courage, tenacity, authenticity, faith, and love.  I really appreciated the author putting it all out there, one minute describing how he had to kill an enemy and the next his faith in God bringing him through a difficult time.  I also appreciated the fact he is a proud Texan.  My wife and her family are from Texas, and the pride and love of the Lone Star State was accurately captured.  I woke up this morning and told my wife that the reason I can drive my children to school in the morning feeling safe and not worried is due to incredible individuals like the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers, et al. making quiet and determined sacrifices every day.  I work in Corporate America, running Human Resources for a company.  We need more individuals with this type of character and value set in Corporate America - it would solve a host of problems.  All in all, one of the best books I've read.
B0007G89G4|5.0|\\"Stand By Me\\" is one of the best movies from the eighties and probably the very best coming of age movie in the entire history of cinema. The late River Phoenix gives an especially stand-alone, and riveting performance as Chris Chambers. This is a wonderful, highly dramatic film that your entire family will treasure for years to come. \\"Stand By Me\\" is directed by Archie's favorite meathead, Emmy-Winning, Rob Reiner.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|Definitely the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I usually don't sit through a movie if it's bad, but I sat through this one, unfortunately. Completely boring, no plot, nothing interesting.  3 hours long. When there was only 15 minutes of it to go, I could not bear to watch it any longer, but watched it anyway in hopes that the 2 hours and 45 minutes I just wasted would at least be redeemed at the end.  Sorry it wasn't. How can this possibly have so many good ratings I don't understand.  The worst, and most boring , and the stupidest movie ever.  And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything?  For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything?  It made absolutely NO sense. Someone must have been paid to write good reviews about this joke of a movie.
1594489505|5.0|This is one of the best Author's in the United States today.  I felt as if I were in Afghanistan with the families.  I felt exactly the same while reading the Kite Runner.  Congratulation's on two marvelous novel's and Thank You for the enjoyment.

0307277887|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first in the Dexter series by Jeff Lindsay.  The series is a firsthand account of America's first \\"likable\\" serial killer.  Dexter only kills bad people...and his point of view is so original that it's impossible to not have a fun read.<br /><br />The story focuses around the mysterious Ice Truck Killer who kills people by disassembling them piece-by-piece.  At the same time he's engaged Dexter in a clever game of serial-killing one-ups-manship.  Will Dexter save the day before someone close to him dies...by his own hand?<br /><br />The Dexter character has also translated well to the Showtime series which is a great example of black comedy done to perfection.  The novel and the series do share many similarities and some important differences (character deaths, unexplored plotlines).  Thus you can read Dexter and watch Dexter and still get the maximum amount of entertainment value.  This is a great character who hopefully will have a very long shelf life.

0634014331|4.0|I have this book, (not like the reviewer who gave it 1 star without reading or owning the book)and  I think it's full of interesting information regarding functions and controls on a hammond organ, various playing techniques and the concept and theory behind creating registrations with the drawbars for different styles of music. Also the Cd is very well played and contains a number of nice pieces of music to play-a-long, plus some voicing techniques, bass lines for the left hand and some soloing techniques. It's not a course on improvisation, but rather an overview of the hammond organ and its possibilities, with music examples played with a full band to put it all in context. Most of the info here can be applied to hammond clones as well (as long as they have drawbars) like korg cx3 nord c1 nord electro, roland vk series , the new hammonds xb1 xk3 etc. So, even more for the players of this new generation keyboards, the philosophy behind the B3 is explained here with enough detail to get you going, and helping you to get a more authentic use of your clone.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|I enjoyed the Bourne Identity......strangely enough I saw it after the Bourne Ultimatum.....which was QUITE difficult to follow not seeing the other two......I enjoyed Damon's love interest in this and I wish thier affair had carried through the series but I thought they were cute together. This is a great movie that pretty much anyone over the age of 18 would be interested in.
B000TGJ8IU|2.0|First, let me say Troy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I was very excited about the director's cut and immediately bought the collector's edition. One thing I noticed right away is that the musical score is different. I really, really don't like the different score. It completely ruined the movie for me. I thought the score to the theatrical release was perfect. Changing it for director's cut without giving me the option for the other really bothered me. The picture quality is great however.
B000P6PVLC|3.0|I love all Brad Pitt movies, this one was decent, very sad but good. It is not my favorite of his flicks but him and Cate Blanchett have great chemistry together and I am excited to see the next picture they star in together. The scenery was good in this movie as well. I saw it in the theaters and it was decent on the big screen.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye West returns for his 3rd installment of his school themed albums entitled \\"Graduation\\"...As were his previous 2 efforts, Kanye stretches the boundaries of rap music as he taps into many different genres like his second single Daft Punk sampling \\"Stronger\\" as well as samples from unlikely sources such as Steely Dan and Elton John...In the end he creates another timeless piece of music with nearly each song quite capable of hitting the streets as well as the pop charts, which ultimetly will lead him to the top of the pop world while still holding down his street cred with songs like lead single \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" and the Lil Wayne assisted \\"Barry Bonds\\"...    A rap album which u can listen from 1-13 without having to press the skip button once which is a nearly unimaginable feat with the 15 second music which floods the airways today...The Chris Martin collabo \\"Homecoming\\" is a purely amazing idea and fulfilled task and the closer \\"Big Brother\\" takes u on a journey of Jay-Z through the eyes of Kanye as a up and coming artist...    With his humourous while still introspective and witty lyrics laid on top of Kanye's typical genious production and amazing selection of samples, Graduation will certainly be a Grammy favorite for Album of the Year!!!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I have had this album since it was released.  When I first received it I listened to it about 10 times or so and was unimpressed.  I filed it back into my CD collection and left untouched until about a month ago.  Since then this album has steadily grown on me to the point that I thoroughly enjoy it now.  Though not as good as Undertow or Aenima (the best tool album in my opinion) it is better than Lateralus.    Like all Tool albums 10,000 Days will grow on you, for some of you it may take a while.  But to the people who gave it 1-3 stars, you'll eventually be back on here upgrading your review.  10,000 Days is a good album, perhaps in another month I'll think it's a great album.
B000002N3N|3.0|I am an enya fan and like her cd's. on this cd I do have to skip over song 2 and 3, song 2 just sticks out like a song I would hear my kids singing so I can't listen to it for long and since I listen to this cd as I commute to sacramento Song 3 chants sacramento mayo dayo, it's like another reminder that I'm commuting, but besides that I really do enjoy the cd. It's just something different to listen to.
B00005JPRF|5.0|\\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\" is great! The cast led by Milla Jovovich (returning as Alice from the first two), and also returning from the last sequel, Oded Fehr (as Carlos Olivera), Mike Epps (as L.J.) & Iain Glen (as Dr. Issacs), is great! The directing by Russell Mulcahy (who also directed \\"The Shadow\\" (1994), \\"Highlander\\" (1986) & \\"Highlander 2: The Quickening\\" (1991) is great! The story and screenplay by Paul W.S.

This is a great sequel that is just as great as the first and second movies.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Just to start, I didn't get to see this show! (Bitter) I heard a few bootlegs of this show, and they overdubbed this one, but there wasn't much to fix! Davids raspy voice made a nice change from the Polished DSOTM cd! Don't get me wrong I am not that critical!! David is my favorite Guitar player!! and this shows why! It's got to be the most bluesy,laid back comfortable FUN Dave since.......Wish? Totally his show! (nice round for Richard!!) GREAT BAND!!!!!! This guy (DAVID) makes his guitar Cry in blues tone!! nothing since \\"Lester and Chester\\" (Les & Chet) have I been so impressed with a guitar players sound! Another point is that he went with the whole album!!! Who has done that? (I love the whole \\"On an Island\\" album anyway. Great back-ups! Phil Manzanera!!! Awesome Roxy man!! Crosby & Nash (Overdubbed?) Well worth the price!! Davids sound is heart stopping for me anyway! I hope it is as good for you!
0143038419|2.0|If a member of my book club hadn't picked it, I wouldn't have finished this book.  I just didn't find the author likable, and thus I couldn't relate to her.  The writing is skillful enough, but it's so much narcissism, me-me-me, who the author is lusting after/having sex with.  There is no explanation on why she felt the need to dump her apparently guiltless husband other than she was bored.  Yeah, I know she said she didn't want to get into the reasons for her divorce, but there's something about her omission (and then the great detail about her immediate jump into the arms of a new lover) that early on left me with an unsympathetic feeling for her, a feeling that I couldn't quite shake off (and I did try).  What she writes about the three countries is trite.  If her idea of finding God was to eat rich food, meditate, and have good sex (nothing that I condemn, by the way; to each her own), why did she need to go to these far-flung locales?  Why couldn't she just spend a year in, say, Fresno, CA?  Because she wouldn't be able to pass that off as a \\"travel memoir?\\"  In the end, the only thing I liked about the book was its sense of humor.  If the author didn't have it, this book would have been irredeemable.  It's an account of  frivolous self-absorption dressed up as chick lit \\"spiritual\\" journey.

B000RG1FMO|1.0|The last CD I bought was Lupe's Food and Liquor and before that Late Registration, mainly because not much out there is worth buying.  Needless to say I had high hopes for this CD but it fell flat on its face.  Kanye is my favorite rapper and I'm saying this.  I let him get by with being cocky cause if you can back it up brag all you want, but don't brag about this garbage.      Within five minutes of listening to it I could tell this album was hollow.  I even tried to take it back 15 minutes after buying but they wouldn't let me return it.  I've listened to it more since and I can't get on any of these tracks.  The whole time I'm waiting for a beat to kick in but it just never happens.  How do you make a CD with no beats when you're one of the best out there?  I can't understand it.  His subject matter is all about being rich and how hard it is to be rich.      Along with this where's Bittersweet.  Where's US Placers?  Thses two songs alone could have bumped this up to three stars but they are nowhere to be found.  Just 13 tracks of hot trash from Kanye West.  Do yourself a favor pass on this.
B000UO338W|4.0|If this is truly their last studio album, Ministry has come full circle. In a career that has spanned almost thirty years, Al Jourgensen leaves a robust legacy having perfected industrial-metal, overcome a toxic drug addiction and, most importantly, remained relevant.    This is the definition of HARD CORE. Play any of these tracks at full blast from your car stereo (with the windows down) and you will inspire looks from passers-by confirming:     \\"...the end is near.\\"     Sonically, Ministry has already gone where few bands dare to venture and this album breaks no new ground. Yet, their musical attack is a nothing short of a jihad against the current global and domestic political state. Very few modern musicians have chosen to go \\"this far\\" with the exception of hip-hop's Immortal Technique.    \\"Death & Destruction\\", \\"Let's Go\\",  and \\"The Last Sucker\\" are all standouts; as is a coma inducing cover of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\". The albums most interesting tracks are \\"The End of Days Part 1 & 2\\".     Keeping with his penchant for including samples of speeches, Jourgensen ends this album and Ministry's studio career with excerpts of former Supreme Allied Commander of Europe and President of the United States, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In his last presidential speech, he prophetically warns Americans about the dangers of an unchallenged, military industrial-complex. When he says \\"..and now I am to become a private  citizen. I am proud to do so. I look forward to it.\\" one can help but conjure up images of \\"Uncle Al\\" bidding us an equal farewell.    cashist

B00005JL78|4.0|2054, Washington D.C. After six years of experiments, Pre-Crime law enforcement - in which murderers are caught before they commit their crime, thanks to the aid of a trio of psychics - has been deemed a success and is on the verge of going national. The project is headed up by Lamar Burgess (Von Sydow) and his protandeacute;gandeacute;, John Anderton (Cruise) who - through this technology - have prevented any murders taking place in the capital for the last six years. Others aren't so convinced - chief among them, F.B.I agent Ed Witwer (Farrell), assigned to find flaws in the system. When one of the psychics - known as 'Pre-Cogs' - predicts that Anderton will commit murder, the former golden boy is forced to go on the run from a system that he helped create.<br />Neither Spielberg nor Cruise have a reputation for making really uncommercial films and Minority Report doesn't deviate radically from their respective career trajectories. It is - with the honourable exception of Schlinder's List - perhaps the darkest movie in Spielberg's catalogue to date. Certainly, it's the most adult orientated of his films. For the most part it is a very enjoyable and intelligent film, which shouldn't fail to entertain most audiences. I liked it.

0689859414|5.0|I can now say that I am a lucky man. I got to meet one of my heroes in San Diego a few weeks back. His name is Tony DiTerlizzi, and as far as I'm concerned, he's one of the most talented illustrators alive. Not since Brian Froud's classic FAERIES book has such a magnificent collection of fairytale art been bound together. Tony's style has a very classic/retro feel, that is also somehow modern at the same time. The palette is perfect, and the takes on these classic faeries are fresh. It is simply a gorgeous book worthy of being enjoyed time and time again.<br /><br />I had a blast looking through each page, pausing to drink in each pencil sketch, and all the wonderfully painted renderings alike. There is no throwaway art in this book -- none at all!<br /><br />The imagination of everyday items like needles, thimbles, and scissors becoming proud objects of the fairies that stole them is masterfully done. I am proud to say that Tony has signed my copy -- and maybe one day I'll be lucky enough to own an original piece of art from the book.<br /><br />Kudos, and masterfully done! This is a treasure!

B00004YYDI|5.0|Having seen the 'movie released' version of Leon - The Professional I was very impressed with the international version.  I enjoyed the exploration of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda and have to say I found it one of the most entertaining movies I've watched in a while.  Leon does what he does and keeps his life simple except where it applies to his relationship with Mathilda.  What develops here is a clear image of a man's desire to help this girl (who he loves both as a daughter and woman, although the movie subtly conveys the ability to keep the two apart.)  Hey, in the end he does the bad guy and helps the good guy.  What more could you ask for??    Great movie - great performances.
B00004RFFS|5.0|As much as I cannot stand Brad Pitt (Louis), I must admit Both he and Tom Cruise (Lestat) were outstanding in this movie. I will point out that fans of the book may be disappointed as significant changes have been made (most notably the homoeroticism that was the backbone of the book is seriously underplayed) but I still enjoyed the movie. It is important to point out the performance of Kirsten Dunst, at the age of 12, (Claudia) she establishes herself quite strongly as a fantastic young actress. Christian Slater as the interviewer is equally great.    Louis rather than choosing the death he desires makes the conscience decision to become a vampire joining forces with Lestat in what is obviously a \\"partnership\\". Unlike Louis, Lestat is unable to reconcile himself to everything involved in being a vampire and soon his erstwhile mortal morals begin to get the best of him much to the disdain of Lestat.      This is a tale of love, desire, betrayal, lonliness, desperation and hunger.    Seeking more, they become \\"parents\\" to a disillusioned child/vampire. Claudia brings a flash of innocence to the story while making it clear that she is deadly, a doll cuddling vampire that will forever remain a child. Louis and Claudia immediately form a bond (perhaps because of the loss of Louis' wife and child during childbirth). Slowly, deliberately, she drives a wedge between Louis and Lestat by taking Louis' love and attention away from Lestat. As can be imagined, the results are devastating.    Free of Lestat, Louis and Claudia depart for Paris, where Louis seeks out other vampires ( he has no choice now but to go on). He comes upon Antonio Banderas (the vampire Armand), who quietly helps him, quite seductively I might add. Armand asks Louis to join him, to be by his side, to allow him to teach him (ok, homoeroticism is clearly evident here). There is a brief scene where the viewer is positive Louis is about to kiss Armand but the moment is lost.      Anne Rice does a beautifuljob with the screenplay (one would expect that since she is the author of the book). And even though she originally was against the casting of Tom Cruise, this statement was later recanted publicly after she saw his performance first-hand. She felt that he did do justice to the character she created.     Cruise, Pitt, Dunst, Banderas and even Slater all performed superbly and derserve credit for a job well done.       Alright, the dialogue does get a little cheesy at times and Brad Pitt underplays his character just a little. But, as vampire movies go, this is one of the best ever made. Director Neil Jordan gives us a dark, dramatic epic tale that is stunningly directed.      I would highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in a great vampire movie or just a well written drama.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Superb, stupendous ,a brilliant masterfull compilation of classic Floyd tunes as well as David's Zen like masterpiece \\"On An Island\\" .

0812550706|5.0|I read this book for the first time nearly 20 years ago and still recall it's excellent story line. Ender and his siblings are developed into incredibly realistic and believable characters. Ender's Game is perfectly written and perfectly concluded. Definitely one of the best ever.
0618680004|1.0|You don't need to get far into The God Delusion to realize that Dawkins is actually theologically illiterate.  It's almost like he doesn't even know that theology is.  His ignorance of religion would almost be humorous were it not for the success of this deceptive book.  His philosophical assertions are elementary and wouldn't even receive a passing grade in a freshman philosophy class.  He doesn't even make sound scientific arguments.  This book has more straw man in it that a field of corn the size of Canada.  This book promotes Atheism in the same light at fundamental religions.  It dogmatically preaches a belief system with a closed mind and no thought for logic and reasoning.  Atheists are forever claiming to be superior in logic and reasoning... well so much for that.  I used to be an Atheist and it's thinking like this that has helped change my mind.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I would have to say that this is one of the most interesting editions of the movie. The documentary showed how David Bowie was doing the crystal globe spinning. He didn't do it. Michael Moschen stood and crouched behind him and did all the movements hidden blind to all the things around him following the script. Fascinating to learn. It must have been so difficult. You never appreciated the performance Bowie and Moschen turned in till you see the bonus material on this edition. Spot on transfer, excellent audio etc. :)

They are still giving us music that catches you with the lyric and melody.  The vocal collaborations with Big and Rich and LeAnn Rimes are genius!  Hillary Lindsey also does a fabulous job with Jon on Seat Next to You.  Any Other Day is my personal favorite that just seems to grab you from, \\"On any other day, I'd be blue eyes crying. I could tell the world at least I'm trying.\\"  It really is music that you can feel!  Lost Highway, Make A Memory, and Whole Lot of Leavin' are all \\"feelable\\" too!

0143038419|5.0|I read again and bought five copies for friends.  It'as as if I was given a long, involved sneak peak into a darling, beautifully verbally astute, spiritual friend's diary.  Elizabeth Gilbert is just as personable, pithy and precocious in the flesh...I highly recommend any of her events.    Om.

B000VNMMRA|4.0|I thought the movie was fantastic. A few scenes where it's obviously far fetched. But overall, it was a great movie. As a personal favorite, it ranks 3rd behind Die Hard With Avengence & the 1st one as best Die Hard movie.

185984054X|4.0|Firstly I will point out that I have been an atheist as long as I have been able to decide over such matters. I group a belief in religion in the same box as Santa Claus and the tooth fairy.   At only 98 pages, this is more a short story or pamphlet than a book. That said, it is very good at exposing the fairly obvious hypocrisy of Mother Teresa and the religious organizations that surrounded her.  Christopher Hitchen's makes particular issue of the fact Mother Teresa used her influence with several world leaders to raise funds for the catholic church. I think where the book lets itself down(and could have been expanded), is that she was only keeping the company of those who engage in similar acts of breathtaking hypocrisy themselves. I'd like to think the reader would realize this, but a reminder would be useful. It's probable most of the leaders she met knew this anyway, but were more interested in being associated with the cult of Mother Teresa, and for her part, the motive was the same.  Mother Teresa was a dedicated catholic (I'm loathe to use the word `good' in any religious context) and her mission was to support and spread Catholicism so her views on abortion and birth control are hardly a revelation. The book does expose the fact that the amount of money received would have easily kitted out several decent hospitals. Hitchen's rightly points out that the Mother Teresa cult was more about creating a catholic monument to the suffering poor than relieving suffering. The catholic church came first, the poor a distant second, but then I don't think this was kept a secret by Mother Teresa. It was the cult surrounding her that seemed to elevate her status as helping the poor. Was some suffering relieved? Yes, but nowhere near as much as was possible and suffering was also made worse.  As regards her likely sainthood, again this is really just the catholic posthumous version of the Congressional Gold Medal or knighthoods etc around the world. Though the catholic church assigns a god or goddess status to those given a sainthood, my own view that this is just nonsense anyway, particularly as the recipient is dead, and wasn't really something I could get hung up on. I know Christopher Hitchen's has petitioned against her becoming a saint, but I hope this was just to highlight to those who perhaps weren't aware of the hypocrisy surrounding this. My own concern is that he perhaps gave the sainthood process far more credibility than it was due. My own view is that this is just a cult within a cult.  I give this book four stars as he has taken on a subject that needed tackling but, like Richard Dawkins books, a revised and expanded version to combat some of the criticisms both here and elsewhere is long overdue.
0393327655|3.0|Sam Harris like Hitchens and Dawkins is a master at setting up religious straw-men and then knocking them down. It is more fun and sells more books than taking on the real thing. Then it becomes balanced and boring. The author looks at the great evils in the world, the cause of which many others have attributed to nationalism, capitalism, lack of \\"lebensraum\\" etc. and claims that religion was the real cause. \\"Knowingly or not Nazis were agents of religion.\\"... \\"Stalin and Mao killed millions because \\"communism was little more than a political religion.\\" Why are the millions killed by Paul Pot not mentioned was he not trying to please God like Stalin, Mao and Hitler? Looking at Webster's definition of religion it is clear that these three ruthless dictators were not great religious leaders.  The author is using words incorrectly to make false accusations.  A \\"political religion\\" is not religion if it does not profess a belief in an after life and God. But the author ignores that fact, because he is out to pin as many bad things  on the word \\"religion\\" as  possible..  Unlike Hitchens Sam Harris is an atheist who does see  bigger differences among religions. He thinks Islam, for example, is especially bad (\\"cult of death\\").   I did not know that Noam Chomsky was any kind of religious thinker but the author takes  a swipe at Noam by stating that Chomsky's view of moral equivalence is a big mistake.\\" It is not clear how that fits in with his attacks on religion, but he gets the third star for that anyway.
B000I2JKFG|1.0|All the right elements here - Matrix filmmaker involvement, Stephen Fry, Natalie Portman, DC comic - this should have been an excellent film.<br /><br />Instead we get one of the lamest screenwriting jobs I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.  I kept watching telling myself, \\"The dialogue will get better, the plot will become less predictable, it will get better, just give it another 20 minutes.....  ok, another 20 minutes...... ok, just 10 more minutes....\\"<br /><br />Sadly, I didn't listen to myself and instead continued watching - hoping and praying the movie would get better.  The acting was fine - they just didn't have anything to work with.  The story is the biggest ripoff ever of the much, much better Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />As far as style, I can't dog this movie at all - it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent.  Just a shame they failed to include even a half-decent screenwriter in that budget!
032147404X|5.0|Im 37 years young and just starting out in photography (well you could say that, even though I have owned a number of cameras since I was a teenager, both film and digital, I just took photos, where as now Im just getting into making a hobby out of it).<br /><br />I got this book because I wanted to know about the different aspects of photography like shutter speed and appature control (plus many other aspects to many to list but the above were the most common two). Prior to now I always used my cameras in auto mode if the shot worked it was OK if it didnt I would flip up the flash and try again. But since reading most of this book I am becomming more adventurous like putting the camera in manual mode and experimenting on different settings. I would read a section of the book and go ahh ok then pick up my new sony alpha SLR and try what scott was refering to. and low and behold Ive seen things I have never seen before, like getting a photo that has a blue tinge to it, which tells me my white balance is out of whack (hey does that mean I have just learnt something from reading a book? and I have never liked reading books my whole life. Who says ya cant teach a old dog new tricks).<br /><br />What I liked about scotts book was his humour added to the book and his whole aspect of the book is set up. On page 2 he explains that the book set out out as thou its just you and scott out on a photo shoot and while you both are shooting you have lots of questions and he gives you a answer like as if you were mates, basically he is going to answer them in the book like he would answer them out there in the real world. {(straight and to the point, without teaching you all the technical aspects and behind the scenes technology of digital photograghy.}<br /><br />Each page is set up as one aspect per page or in other words one question and answer per page. for expample on page 2 he writes {if we were out shooting and you turned to me and said, \\"hey scott, I want to take a shot where that flower over there is in focus but the background is out of focus. How do I do that?\\" I wouldnt turn to you and give you a speech about smaller and larger apertures, about how exposure equals shutter speed plus aperture, or any that stuff you can read in any book about digital photography(and I mean any book - its in every one). In real life, Id just turn to you and say, \\"put on your zoom lens, set your aperture at f/2.8, focus on the flower, and fire away.\\"}<br /><br />Thats how the whole book works basically. I also found his humour to be much like mine so it made it more a pleasurable read. What scott has acheived in this book is what my teachers back in school tried to get me to do many years ago..... Read more books. I hate reading or simply dont. but since reading scotts book I find myself going thru book stores and searching amazon.com for more books on the two most things (well you could call em hobbies at the moment) in my life now, Photography and cooking (not always in that order thou) so much so that I am thinking of going further than a hobby and trying to make money out of photography. and if I could incorperate the other things I love in life into photgraghy I'd be the happiest man alive......mmmmm thinking do you think there is any money in taking photos of sex or food???.....just kidding<br /><br />Once I have got more experienced on the taking of photos side Im gunna try the other aspect of photography the editing side in photshop cs2. Which I hear scott is a excellent teacher of that too. Might have to get some of his books on that subject too.ere is in focus but the background is out of focus.

B000002KYK|5.0|This is far better than the Vangelis soundtrack. Even the Vangelis CD has idiotic movie voice overs inserted into the music, giving it an aged and inadequate \\"artsy\\" quality, taking away from any aesthetic it could offer.<br /><br />Within the orchestra version, I originally felt a little dissapointed by what appeared to be a limitation in the available tracks, however it turns out that the reprised version choose to be an adequate choice. Though, I do admit to wanting some additional music that clearly was omitted, though it is acceptable given what I perceive of limitations in Vangelis CD.<br /><br />The sound quality has a very high sample rate, and with a high end sound system, it sounds extraordinary! Many tracks are FAR better produced, surpassing Vangelis, in that sense. If only they included some missing tracks, I would rate it 6 out of 5.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|I have been enjoying this album since I bought it shortly after it's release. I bought the album on a whim, mostly because I could not get Icky Thump out of my head.  If you aren't hung up with \\"selling out\\" and Indie cred, buy this album. This is a blues-inspired, hard-rocking album that surpasses \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\" Jack White shows his playful side with great songs like \\"Rag and Bone\\" and \\"Effect and Cause.\\" And he shows off some excellent guitar shredding on \\"Little Cream Soda.\\" Above all, I could listen to the title track \\"Icky Thump\\" over and over again, which is the mark of good music in my book.  \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" was a huge album for the Stripes, but \\"Icky Thump\\" shows that when Jack White steps away from the piano and picks up a guitar, he makes even better music.

B000VZUWZW|1.0|Wow what a terrible show...    I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with \\"unfunny\\".    It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on.
0887306101|5.0|I am far from a great trader and definitely in the category of novice. My brother recommended I read this book and its follow on. The knowledge I picked up from both books coupled with a lot of reading and research spawned by what I found in the book have allowed me to generate decent returns on investments that have been stagnant for about a year. Within a three week time period I was able to go from being in the hole 6% in unrealized gains to being up over 10% in unrealized gains. I have since realized those gains and re-invested them looking to turn some more profit.     So I would say this is definitely a worthwile read for those interested in finding out how the big investors/traders became who they are and trying to come up with your own methodology for not falling into some of the pitfalls the market holds for the novice investor.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|The music is great. In fact it is better than her first album (available here [...] The new versions are more \\"exciting\\" and just well \\"better\\". Unfortunately they are harmed by, as is customary for big label commercial music nowadays, an overly COMPRESSED sound (argh why do they do that?). If you have no idea was \\"compressed\\" means, will listen to this album in mp3 format on your ipod, or only have a cheapo boombox/stereo you'll greatly enjoy this album. If you have a high end stereo, do yourself a favor and buy Careful Confessions from cdbaby.
B000LE1GVW|1.0|There is just no accounting for (lack of) taste.  I've read the reviews of this CD --- \\"brilliant\\" \\"soul singer\\"????????  What the hell kind of soul singer is that??  He just sounds like an old drunk or junkie who is slurring his speech before he nods off.  Easily the most pretentious and annoying act I've heard (or seen) since David Gray.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I have to admit that when I first sat down to watch this, I was prepared to hate it. I was tired and being forced to watch it against my will. Much to my surprise, the movie soon captured my interest. The emotions and obsessions of the two main characters was built up quite well.     But then the end. With the sci-fi element. I love sci-fi, but in this movie, in my opinion, it ruined the ending. It made everything not so believable. It ruined the magic of the movie and the magic was a great element in this movie and to suddenly add the sci-fi in it was not a great move.   Other then a not so great ending, the movie was thoroughly enjoyable and definitely deserves a watch but maybe not a buy.
0061122416|1.0|I read the first five pages and I wanted to puke. There is nothing in this book that is good. Paulo Coelho's lack of writing skills is appalling. He cannot write a single sentence without making the most basic grammar errors.  Probably he is much more readable in other languages than in Portuguese because the translators certainly should correct all such errors. Coelho's lack of talent is so shocking as his common-place sentences and images that he tries to evoke... If he was writing a mystery novel, he would start like:\\"one dark, raining night...\\".       Paulo Coelho is a poser, and in my mind, only people who never put their hands in a good book can appreciate his complete nonsense. I give it one star because I am unable to give it zero
B000002UAI|5.0|Para finales de 1964, los Beatles eran el centro del universo y mas populares que Jesucristo. Los grandes mafiosos de las disqueras lo sabian, y querian sacarles el jugo antes que pasaran de moda. Presionaron para que el cuarteto tuviera un disco para la navidad de aquel año. Lennon y McCartney no tenian los 14 temas que requeria aquel dichoso album, y repitieron la formula del Please Please Me y el With The Beatles interpretando canciones de otros compositores. El resultado, Beatles For Sale, y el titulo es ideal para el disco, en verdad todo lo concerniente a Beatles estaba a la venta, era rentable, hasta hoy.    Esta presentacion del Beatles For Sale viene en sonido monoaural. Por consiguiente no esperen un sonido espectacular, y mucho menos siendo una edicion del 87. El disco tiene valor por I'm A Loser, escrita por Lennon, mostrando chispazos de la influencia de Dylan, dejar de escribir estupidas y tontas canciones de amor y letras sin sentido, al fin y al cabo, para eso estaba Paul; y hacer algo que vaya en contra de la corriente, canciones realistas y de fracaso, de rechazo, como la chica que no da respuesta a tus llamados como lo demuestra No Reply . El resto es relleno. No hay que ser mezquinos y reconozcamosle a Paul su tema I'll Follow The Sun y su interpretacion de Kansas City.    Beatles For Sale suena mejor en stereo, y yo sigo prendiendole velas a todos los santos habidos y por haber, incluso a Krishna, Budha y Ala, para que EMI y Apple reediten el catalogo Beatle con un sonido digno de nuestros tiempos, en stereo y remasterizado. Total, los Beatles estuvieron, estan y estaran en venta.
B000OURSO2|5.0|This is a poignant, compelling narrative about Chris McCandless, an intelligent, intense, and idealistic young man, who cut off all ties to his upper middle class family. He then reinvented himself as Alexander Supertramp, a drifter living out of a backpack, eking out a marginal existence as he wandered throughout the United States. A modern day King of the Road, McCandless ended his journey in 1992 in Alaska, when he walked alone into the wilderness north of Denali. He never returned.<br /><br />Krakauer investigates this young man's short life in an attempt to explain why someone who has everything going for him would have chosen this lifestyle, only to end up dead in one of the most remote, rugged areas of the Alaskan wilderness. Whether one views McCandless as a fool or as a modern day Thoreau is a question ripe for discussion. It is clear, however, from Krakauer's writing that his investigation led him to feel a strong, spiritual kinship with McCandless. It is this kindred spirit approach to his understanding of this young man that makes Krakauer's writing so absorbing and moving.<br /><br />Krakauer retraced McCandless' journey, interviewing many of those with whom he came into contact. What metamorphosed is a haunting, riveting account of McCandless' travels and travails, and the impact he had on those with whom he came into contact. Krakauer followed McCandless' last steps into the Alaskan wilderness, so that he could see for himself how McCandless had lived, and how he had died. This book is his epitaph.
0385474547|5.0|It is amazing how a novel first published in 1959 about a Nigerian village, pre-colonization, still has relevance today.  Talk about transcending time as well as cultures!  Chinua Achebe is a magnificent story teller.  I love authors who have the ability to transport me to worlds that seem so different from my own.    Okonkwo was a man that was obsessed with masculinity and the \\"power\\" of being masculine.  Although I could see how harsh, abusive, and unyielding Okonkwo was towards his family, oddly I felt sympathy for the man.  He was the product of his environment and culture.  Apparently his callousness was worsened because of his fear that he should become like his father ----- a man with no title, in his culture, the equivalent of being a woman.    How many of us struggle to balance the new with the old?  And how often do we question or all out resist changing times.... be it attitudes or ideas, advancements in technology, religion, policies, music, etc.  Most of us reach a certain age where we would prefer our traditions be left alone.  In some instances there should be no room for compromise, but in other instances perhaps there truly is improvement/advancement to be gained.    Okonkwo's struggle is exactly that.  He strives to leave behind a proud legacy.  However, he makes bad decisions along the way.  The more he tries to make things right the more it seems that misfortune comes his way.  He's angered and confused about the changes that come upon his village but that combined with his pigheaded demeanor make for a disastrous result.  It's a good book to take up beyond school required reading.  Achebee gives his readers a great deal to consider.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|After Sony and Capcom rejected zombie genre director George A. Romero's script in 1999, Director Paul W.S. Anderson was selected to take over the reigns of the Resident Evil production which was somewhat inspired by its video game counterpart as well as the Disney fairytale, Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />Overall, Resident Evil was an entertaining movie from start to finish as it had a little bit of everything, including a foundation for a sequel (which turned out to be 2004's Resident Evil Apocalypse).  I especially liked the scene transition using a digital schematic of the Umbrella Corporation's research facility known as the \\"The Hive.\\"<br /><br />Check it out!  But if you are a diehard Resident Evil videogame player, you will need to divest yourself first of Resident Evil cannon in order truly enjoy its cinematic interpretation which clearly stands on its own.

He has the talent of writing so vividly that you are sucked into the story and felt like you were part of the characters.  It showed another side of the unknown country we all so want to know about.  Poignant, but beautiful.

Ludlum takes the reader on a wild ride as we travel the world with Jason Bourne.  We are fighting along side him as we track 'Carlos' around the globe and we fall in love with Marie as he does.  Matt Damon did a wonderful job but the real Bourne lives within these pages.  You won't be disappointed with any of Ludlum's books - I've read them all.
B000GB775E|2.0|This film is an hour and a half of insults to the intellect.      Read all the reviews here, you know the story.  Girl loses good luck to a guy she kisses.  Now she has to find this guy and kiss him again.  She kisses every guy around town.  How pretty.    But the thing about the film that was so annoying was they didn't play it right.  Instead of switching luck, they should've had the two characters switch utter stupidity.  After Lohan gets the guys \\"bad luck\\" she becomes a moron.  Apparently falling off of chairs, throwing electrical hairdriers into water and changing light bulbs while they are still illuminated all attribute to \\"bad luck,\\" when really it was just stupidity.  The worst part is, just about every idiot will eat this stuff up and laugh at it.  I spent the entire movie predicting what kind of stupid thing was going to happen next.      This movie is written for morons.  But at least Lindsay Lohan is in it so every adolescent girl will see it and crave the lifestyle of a rich, no work girl in a sweet studio apartment with her hot friends.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|This is the film adaptation of what might be the best graphic novel I`ve ever read. There are no words to describe how much I love the original comic book so I attended the North American premiere of Tekkon Kinkreet at the Moma in NY with high expectations.   Not only did the movie not fail to meet them but in fact added exciting and unexpected layers to the story. I am an animator; I`m rarely satisfied with the technical aspects of most animated features but the production on Tekkon is flawless. The animation, character design, backgrounds and camera work are all top notch. The two main characters are rendered in all their complexity and the movie doesn't shy away from the deep implications that the original story holds within its pages.    The movie is faithful to the comic book and the storyline is basically the same. However, Michael Arias and studio 4C were sometimes inventive, albeit in appropriate and creative ways. The new uniforms of the three warriors that Snake sends to kill Black and White are beautiful and reminiscent of a Moebius illustration- the final confrontation between Black and the two remaining warriors is held in the amusement park instead of the car-shelter site (which makes room for new dynamic shots) - but my favorite shift from the original material has to be the minotaur sequence. A lot of people complained that the movie is not as daring as Mind Game (studio 4C`s previous adventure into full length features) but I disagree - the animation gets very experimental during the minotaur scene showing the thin line between reality and Black's violence saturated subconscious. I  loved the way they communicated the internal struggle by using the graphic language of animation alone.  Overall, Mind Game's pastiche of animation styles is probably more audacious but Tekkon more than compensates for it's more rigorous style with incredibly strong characters (MG characters came off as a little wacky at times) and a story that is so good that it hurts.If your eyes are not wet by the time Black and White get separated you are a soul-less fiend and you may want to consider a career in advertising.  I haven't been so excited about an anime since Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence hit the theaters; it's a shame that while it was one of the most important movies of the year in Japan, Tekkon Kinkreet got very limited distribution in Europe and in the US - so do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!

1596912855|5.0|Despite a far-fetched premise, Hale writes with such sweetness and humor that I couldn't help but be enchanted by the characters and world she creates.  This novel plays with reality and fantasy on many levels, continually challenging her characters and the reader to reexamine their first impressions and inferences.  From the likeable (if slightly neurotic) Jane - with her hilarious trail of disappointing ex-boyfriends - to the sharp writing and witty dialogue, Hale had me entertained from cover to cover.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|\\"The Holiday\\" is a cute, romantic movie about two women, Amanda and Iris (Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet), who both find themselves royally screwed over by the men in their lives. Amanda and Iris connect via a housing-swap Web site and agree to switch houses for two weeks in order to escape during the holidays. Amanda heads to England, where she is immediately swept off her feet by Iris's charming brother, Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile, Iris arrives in L.A. and is blown away by Amanda's posh lifestyle. She befriends an elderly neighbor (Eli Wallach) who is a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and ultimately finds an unexpected new love interest in Miles (Jack Black), a film composer.<br /><br />This is a fun little movie. I enjoyed the Amanda/Graham scenes most of all. Diaz and Law have excellent chemistry and make a great on-screen pair. I am a huge fan on Winslet and she did a great job in the film as well, but the scenes with her really dragged on a bit in the beginning. There were too many scenes where Iris was just sitting around lamenting about her cad of an ex-boyfriend. My other major beef with this film is that I do not understand why Jack Black is in it. Was no one else available? I have no problem with Black, but this just isn't his type of role, and there was absolutely no romantic spark of any kind between him and Winslet.<br /><br />In spite of its few flaws, I still enjoyed \\"The Holiday\\" very much. It's a sweet romantic comedy that will make you laugh and smile.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Kanye West is an insult to real hip-hoppers everywhere. What he does best is buy a track from an established artist like Steely Dan or Daft Punk and then lamely rap over it.

0060536357|4.0|A takeover story that reads like a Jeffrey Archer novel, Barbarians at the Gate is a meticulously detailed account of the takeover of RJR Nabisco by KKR in the late 80s. The authors were WSJ journalists who covered the story for the Journal and the book does a great job of communicating the tension and intrigue of those six weeks in 1988. The book does slack in pace at times but the story keeps you engaged. Recommended.
0143036742|4.0|Lewycka, who has written several nonfiction books about senior citizens' issues, has written a lyrical and engaging novel about growing old disgracefully and the bonds of sisterhood.    This book, first and foremost, is hilarious. There are dozens of scenes that made me laugh out loud. First are the relationship between Nadezhda's father, Nikolai, and his tarty Ukrainian bride, Valentina. Valentina is a scene stealer. She is gruff and greedy, venal and violent. She is a larger than life character, and the white whale to the sisters' Ahab. Nikolai himself is given to melodrama and long winded speeches about tractors and engineering. Vera, Nadya's big sister, also provides a great deal of comic relief, with her jaundiced and acerbic takes on the situation with Valentina and her father. It is a bit like reading a toned down version of \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\".    Lewycka also explores sibling rivalry and the relationships of estranged siblings. At the beginning of the story, Nadezhda and Vera are fighting like cats and dogs. Every encounter ends in harsh words and slammed phones. As the book progresses, the sisters steadily get closer, having been united by the common desire to get Valentina deported. As Vera and Nadezhda talk more and more, they get closer. Nadezhda finds out why her sister is the way she is, and ultimately becomes close to Vera. By the end of the book, they are cordial and even a little warm towards each other. Lewycka masterfully handles this relationship, never letting it become cloying or saccharine. It is a touching undercurrent to the outlandish events that take center stage.    Finally, Lewycka explores the differences in first and second generation immigrants. Nikolai and Vera are first generation Ukrainian immigrants, while Nadezhda is firmly British in her outlook. The sisters have had markedly different childhoods. Vera endured life in a camp during World War II, while Nadezhda was born in the U.K. It is this difference that causes the chasm between the sisters. But, Lewycka does a good job of showing how Nadezhda slowly but surely begins to understand her sister's life and her outlook on life. We also get to hear the story of Nikolai and Ludmilla, the womens' parents. Their lives in the Ukraine, through pre-Stalin days and the horrors of the purges are explored in depth. It speaks to Lewycka's skill as a writer that these interludes perfectly fit into the narrative and help the reader understand Nikolai's motivations.    A great book for someone looking to laugh and learn about immigrants.
0743496728|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but so far I think it's very good. It's very descriptive, which to me is important so I can create a mental image. I'd recommend this book 1000%!!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|It's your boy J-RE! (artist). This album is cool man, real cool. I like the transition of this album. The previous albums were great, the only thing i didn't like about those albums were the 50 million skits. With this album, there's no skits, just pure raw heat. The beats are tight and Kanye's flow is tight. I really can't say anything negative about this album. Kanye is a different type of artist with a different type of flow. You really can't compare him to other artists, cause he'e different. And that's why I like him because he is an artist, and that's what art is about. He clearly expressed his art on this album and I look forward to hearing his transition in the future. Cool album! Albums like this, keep Hip Hop Alive. It's your boy J-RE!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|It's apparent that BBC spent a lot of time and money producing this documentary.  Some of the captured video is incredible.  Here's my take on it, so far.    The first two episodes contained quite a few predator scenes that may not be suitable for young children.  In fact, I was quite surprised at how many hunting scenes were shown, although it is nature, and that's the way things are in the wild.    I preferred the scenic episodes.  The shots of the mountains, deserts, valleys and glaciers were spectacular.  A few times per episode, less than high definition footage was added to fill in some gaps, and it's very obvious when viewed from a large, 1080P plasma like mine.  Most of the audio was amazing.  There were a few dubbed-in sounds (to complement footage filmed by helicopter) that were unnecessary.  All in all, a very good documentary.  Four stars.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|I was not a huge fan of United 93 as a movie. The subject matter is certainly valid, but I thought as a movie, the story was not told well and by the end of the movie I was mad and looking for revenge! World Trade Center on the other hand is also valid subject matter and a gripping inspirational movie! A fitting tribute to our public servants and to our country. This film was much better than I expected. The DVD transfer and extras are very good.
B00005JPRF|4.0|Pretty good, I thought. Not as good as the first two, in my opinion, but certainly entertaining enough for the discriminating gorehound. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION returns us to the world become ruined by the T-Virus, which had given rise to zombies and other beasties. As the film catches us up, we learn that five years had elapsed since [[ASIN:0767834739 Resident Evil - Apocalypse (Special Edition)]], and apocalypse indeed has arrived. Most of humanity has been eradicated, having been infected and become the shambling undead. The virus has now spread virtually all over the world, with even the forests and oceans having been tainted.<br /><br />Mobile pockets of humanity struggle to survive. The best way to stay alive is to be constantly on the move. And so, an armored caravan passengered by frightened survivors, led by hardy but beautiful Claire Redfield (a character pulled from the video games Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil, Code: Veronica), ends up in a deadend desert motel in blighted Nevada, in dire need of replenishment. It's there that they meet Alice, whose motorbike had just \\"collapsed.\\" It's not all new faces for Alice as she reconnects with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr, THE MUMMY) and L.J. (Mike Epps), who are now part of Claire's security personnel.<br /><br />A journal found by Alice states that Alaska remains uninfected and thus provides possibly the last refuge on earth. I don't know why or how an anonymous journal becomes so believable to a pack of strangers, but, never mind. Alaska now becomes the new goal and hope for the weary and desperate survivors. But not if the Umbrella Corporation has a say in the matter. And it does. Yes, a powerful vestige of the Umbrella Corporation yet exists and still claims an immaculately attired staff. Numbering among that staff is one particularly manipulative, despicable, sick son of a - well, he's a scientist. And he dearly craves Alice for further experimentation as her blood has somehow reached an accomodation with the T-Virus. Cloning of her has thus far proved fruitless and a continuing waste of sexy red dresses. Thus paves the way for the unleashing of even more zombies!! Cor!<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION, this time stirring in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max element, satisfies with its short on dialogue but long on horror action theme. There's enough clipped exposition to explain the essentials, then it's on to the gross zombie slicing, chopping, and back-of-the-skull explosions. The film is typically brutal in its high body count. There's an air of bleakness found here, although it's not as extreme as in Romero's [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00008G8L9 Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)]] (now that one was really grim).<br /><br />The difference, of course, is that in this end-of-the-world zombie saga, there boldly strides Alice, an honest-to-gosh superwoman onto whom we can latch our hopes. The stoic, ultracapable, and resilient Alice (now making full use of her psychokinetic gifts) can handily dispose of mutated deathhounds, backwoods lunatics, and flocks of predatory zombiefied crows, although it should go without saying that the main staple on her maiming menu is still human zombies. Milla Jovovich sexily graces the screen and has now imprinted on my mind as Alice to such an extent that any future role by Milla wherein she plays a mere love interest would render me severely discombobulated. And, mind you, I really liked her in [[ASIN:B00009AOBM Kuffs]]. Her role as Alice doesn't really call for any acting stretches, but she full out commits to her character and imbues her with enough soul and sensitivity that you do care for her. And, once again, Milla proves her physicality by once more doing her share of the stunts (she underwent training in the use of the intimidating kukri blades).<br /><br />This movie provides us with three strong and independent female role models: Alice, Claire, and Nurse Betty. Ali Larter (FINAL DESTINATION, HEROES) as the group's leader Claire and Oded Fehr as Carlos lend credibility to their scenes with a full investment into their roles. Ashanti doesn't wow me with her acting skills but her Betty does show great courage in the face of horrific adversity.<br /><br />But we all came to see harrowing monster action, and we get gory bucketfuls of the stuff. Impeccable CGI blends with nifty stunts. Throw in the hard-charging rock music to rev up the audience, and it's a can't lose recipe. On the downside, I must admit to feeling disappointment with the super zombies, who didn't seem all that \\"super.\\" Other than one sequence in the lab in which one super zombie works a cell phone and shoots a camera before he goes berserk, I didn't feel that this breed was a marked improvement over the generic ravenous undead. As well the big monster villain near the end (a Tyrant-model from the video game) could've benefited with more screen time, to allow the audience to feel more invested in his eventual showdown with Alice. For sure, he gave her all she could handle, and then some.<br /><br />If this is indeed the last of the series, then, as a fan of horror action and post-apocalyptic adventures, I count myself content.<br /><br />But I do wonder if Alaska turned out to be uncontaminated after all.L DESTINATION, HEROES) as the group's leader Claire and Oded Fehr as Carlos lend credibility to their scenes with a full investment into their roles.

B00005JPMZ|5.0|A fun bit of fluff to enjoy with the kids.  It is a pretty good movie with a lot of humor and family values...on the turtle level.
B00003CXA6|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXA6 Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)]]  Civil War re-enactors, history buffs, and those who will be \\"bitten\\", take note!  This movie is FANTASTIC!  My family and I recently visited the Gettysburg battlefield, so we had some reference points.  Before viewing this movie, an overall basic study would greatly help to understand the historical significance and military strategy of the era.  Now that we have seen this movie, we are researching even more about the Civil War era!  If you just want a good, sit-back-in-your-seat movie, this comes highly recommended.  The only complaint is Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee as more of a dreamer than a strategist.  The prequel to this movie, \\"Gods and Generals\\" has Robert Duvall as Lee, who he excellently depicts.  PLEASE check out the documentaries of this movie!  The background helps with the battle scenes.
B000RJO578|5.0|Hot Fuzz is a funny little movie from Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg.  It is a quirky romp through the weird. The dead are piling up, the police force is filled with morons and the citizen's only concern seems to be winning the best village award.  Simon Peggs character brings the voice of reason to the mix but no one is listening.  ...And the swan is on the loose. I doubt that you can guess the ending or who is on whose side until the end.  Best if you watch it with a friend, beer and pizza.      Not for small children, some of the murders are quite gruesome.
B000SZLSB2|3.0|I found the first cd absolutely addictive.  While this is good, it's not nearly as addictive.  I still think he's great but I'm sure that I'll listen to the previous cd far more often.  I wish this one had the same effect on me but,,, unfortunately, I think my expectations were just too high.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Deserves more credit than it received. Here we have a movie that offers us something different to the tired old usual mix of sequels and re makes (or re imaginings as script writers and directors prefer to say in some cases). It has a good script, good dialog, great cinematography, good acting and a great blend of various genres. Another A+ for Quentin Tarantino along with Kill Bill etc. Forget going to see a \\"Re Imagined Halloween\\" at the cinema and buy this DVD instead,I'm glad I did. Great soundtrack too.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|After about the third listen through, I began to believe this CD is Mark's essence, what he has really wanted to achieve all along. It's subtle and intelligent as always, and the songs seem meticulously well-crafted. But this time there is a pleasing, overall coherence that goes beyond his other creations. His genius blends superbly with Guy Fletcher's, his long-time production partner.      This is not for the silly MTV crowd. It's not about high energy, gaudy, show-off sound. If you still want that, then Mark has gone on and left you. This is wise, reflective, grown-up people's music. That's where the music gets its power. Knopfler is like Dylan, Morrison and a few others - he continues to mature (and he seems like such a nice guy too, someone you would like to sit beside on an plane flight).       Buy this and see if after a short while all those thoughtful sound waves and images don't settle in your head. I say they will.
B000K7UBTI|2.0|First off, I love Iron Man and almost all of the Marvel superheroes. I was excited when I heard about not only the live action Iron Man film coming next May but an animated Iron Man film coming to DVD. I just watched it last night and I'm very, very upset.  I've noticed that the American child audience is in love with Japanese Anime cartoons. You see it every day on the Cartoon Network and now, Marvel followed suit with the animated Iron Man flick. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, Iron Man has become Anime. Even the story takes place in China! It's not about Iron Man and War Machine, it's Iron Man and ancient Chinese spirits! The only notable thing about this movie is that the basic origin of Iron Man is here but this time, a Chinese gang has kidnapped him and he has to battle Chinese elemental gods. Wow. Nice going Marvel. Ruin a great superhero. Even the special features aren't worth it. There's a feature called \\"The Origin of Iron Man\\" which leads you to believe it's about the true origin of Iron Man but it's actually about the origin of the movie. It's basically the making of the movie. They mention a bit of the real origin(Tony was a munitions dealer in 'Nam, stepped on a mine and a piece of scrap metal gets him right in the chest...we know the rest) but it's not what you'd expect. They wanted the movie current, so they went with ancient China! C'Mon! How many times have they reverted to the trite plot of ancient Chinese spirits?!! Overall, if you really like Iron Man, rent this or just borrow it from somebody you know that might have it. It's really not good.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Saw this in the theater. Loved it. After reading it is split up and the trailers are gone, won't buy it. Whoever is responsible for this decision is stupid. I looked forward to seeing this again in its original form on DVD and this is what they do. I'm not interested in the extra scenes. I'm interested in seeing this the way it was in the theater, i.e. two movies, fake trailers. I don't know why this flopped in theaters because it was great in its original format, but I hope these dual DVD releases sans fake trailers fail miserably. This was a bad, bad decision. I'm very disappointed.
1594489505|5.0|Beautiful and moving, this amazing book has it all - a wonderful story, incredible writing, and just the right amount of history.  The vivid descriptions of Kabul and the surrounding countryside are so real that you feel as though you are there.  And it is certainly eye-opening to see what life could be like for young women in Afghanistan. Your heart goes out first to Mariam and then to Laila as they both make the best of their situations.  Difficult to put down, the book keeps you hoping for their lives to improve even when they are living under extreme Taliban oppression. Happily the book ended on a note of hope for Laila and Tariq as conditions in Afhanistan began to improve.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|This movie is not as good as so many reviewers claim, but not as bad as others tell me it is. It is somewhere in between.  The movie is too unnecessarily long, why do we have to watch the mexican caretaker walk through the desert for so long? a minute or a minute and a half had been enough time to make us aware of her predicament; and the sequence of the deaf-mute japanese girl in the ballroom seemed like it went forever,I fast forwarded a lot of it, it should have been shortened, for that matter the entire \\"japanese tale\\" should have been edited out and I think it has been a better film.  This is one DVD that I will not keep in my collection, since I'm sure that I will never view it again.
0805079831|5.0|Klein's book is a solid and invaluable study of \\"economic shock therapy\\" (sudden privatization removal of all trade barriers, accompanied by drastic reductions in taxes and social spending) over the past three decades.  She concludes that economic shock therapy (originally formulated by economist Milton Friedman) cannot be implemented without a preceding crisis (eg. hyperinflation (eg. Chile, Bolivia), weather disasters (eg. Katrina or the 2004 tsunami in South Asia), war (eg. 9/11, Iraq War II), or major political upset (eg. the Soviet Union after Gorbachev's resignation), and requires suppression of dissent to succeed.  The \\"really bad news\\" is that each example cited by Klein quickly led to massive economic worsening for the general populace.  Worse yet, is Friedman's statement that \\"our (true free-market enthusiasts) basic function is to develop alternatives to existing policies, and to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\\"  Worst of all, is a suspicion that the current administration is committed to bringing about such crises if they don't naturally occur.<br /><br />Friedman first learned to exploit large-scale crisis in the mid-70s while acting as advisor to Chile's General Pinochet following his violent 1074 coup.  Tax cuts, free trade, privatized services, cuts in social spending, deregulation, voucher-funded private schools quickly followed.  Torture cells and mass murders stifled dissent.  Unemployment went from 3 to 20% (ultimately 30% in 1982), and thousands of business foundered.  Eventually Pinochet was forced to rescind much of what had been done, and Chile began recovering - mainly thanks to its government copper mines that had not been privatized.  A lasting result, however, that in 2007, Chileans had the 8th most unequal income distribution.<br /><br />Russia's Yeltsin wasted no time after Gorbachev's 10/91 resignation, and in his first week announced lifting price controls (70% opposed), free trade policies, and the beginning of rapid privatization of the nation's 225,000 state-owned companies.  Parliament agreed to give Yeltsin free rein for a year.  At the end of that period the economy had fallen 40%, and rising opposition prompted Yeltsin to disband Parliament and back up his decrees with military rule and arrests.  A small group of oligarchs managed to use government monies deposited in their just-created banks to buy vast national assets at fire-sale prices - eg. 51% of one oil company went for $130 million, only to be valued two years later at $2.8 billion.  (Only Russians were allowed ownership.)  These oligarchs then supported Yeltsin with large donations and heavy media coverage - 800X that of his rivals.  Despite winning the election, Yeltsin's approval rating fell to 6%, and by '98, over 80% of Russian farms were bankrupt, those living in poverty rose from 2 million to 74 million in 8 years, the population declined 10%, etc.<br /><br />Undeterred, reformers' next stop was Iraq.  This time, U.S. firms would be the first in line for the anticipated easy billions.  Bremer spent most of his first four months almost exclusively on economic matters - privatizing everything in sight (except oil - was warned that to do so would create enormous resistance), lowering the corporate tax rate from 45 to 15%, allowing foreign companies to own 100% of Iraqi assets and take out 100% of the profits, and cementing deals with 40-year leases and contracts.  Meanwhile, de-Baathification removed skilled people from their posts, weakened the voice of secular Iraqis, and fed the resistance - already red hot from Bremer's having dismissed the entire 400,000 man Iraqi army.  Unemployment, already high, rose even more.  Then, it was on to rewrite the Iraq constitution to cement these changes - this succeeded at first, but opposition led to a second rewriting where these changes were lost.<br /><br />Only 15,000 Iraqis were hired for reconstruction projects under Bremer; meanwhile, American companies made billions, aided by 20-50% overheads that incorporated multiple levels of contracting to share the wealth with Kuwaitis and Saudis.<br /><br />As for U.S. government waste - no problem!  Our decaying infrastructure becomes an opportunity to turn additional areas over to private enterprise, companies like Blackwater ($950/day to guard FEMA staff and facilities during Katrina) and Custer Battles provide a solid source of on-going Republican-party donations.  Iraq War expenditures and tax cuts provide motivation for standing against children's' health care funding.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to \\"benefit\\" from expanded free trade just like Chile, Bolivia, Poland, Russia, and Iraq have done - with increased income inequality and lower standards of living.<br /><br />Joseph Stiglitz, 2001 Nobel Prize-winner in economics, also reviewed this book (New York Times, 9/30/07).  While not entirely supportive, he also concluded that \\"the case against these (Friedman's) policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes. They were never based on solid empirical and theoretical foundations, and even as many of these policies were being pushed, academic economists were explaining the limitations of markets.\\"ies made billions, aided by 20-50% overheads that incorporated multiple levels of contracting to share the wealth with Kuwaitis and Saudis.

0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali grew up in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya.  Her childhood was unkind and she endured more heartache, abuse and tragedy than most people can ever imagine in an entire lifetime.      Ms. Ali grew up in a family and culture where strict adherence to Islamic traditions where observed.   This adherence controlled the way she would behave with family members, what she could read, who she would marry and how she would live.     When her father arranged her marriage to a man from Somalia, living in Canada, she was forced to accept it and flew to Europe where she would wait for her time to go to Canada.    During this visit to Europe she began to question, ever more deeply, the contradictions of her faith and the assumptions she grew up with about the western world.    Not wanting to live as her mother had, with no sense of self and no freedom to choose, she decided to travel to the Netherlands and take political asylum there.  Here she attended the university and fell in love with the freedoms that were afforded to her and the world that was opening up for her.   After she graduated from the University with a Masters in Political Science she eventually made her way to the Parliament.    Even without discussing her religious conclusions, her story is a fascinating story of triumph that makes Infidel a worthwhile book.    After 9/11 Ms. Ali denounced Islam and begun to express her views of the oppression of Muslim women in the Netherlands.   She received a lot of notoriety, primarily because her opinions were not being voiced by many other prominent figures, for fear of offending Muslims or being called Islamophobic.    The fact that she was, in fact, a Muslim made her points of view even more controversial and offensive to the Muslim community.    If Ms. Ali had grown up Christian and later denounced her Christianity I doubt seriously that anyone would even hear her story.    There would be no death threats and she wouldn't be the scorn of millionsof Christians.  The reason for this should be examined carefully, especially in this era where the western world and western culture are under attack by Islamic extremists.      I take her story as representative of a portion of Islam and not the entire religion.   I am aware that there are millions of peaceful followers of Islam.   I believe the majority of them are, in fact, peaceful and follow a different interpretation of their religion then the extremist minority.   All Muslims I know, personally, fall under this peaceful category of followers.   However, in a religion of over a billion followers, it is important to understand the percentage of this minority for only a small percentage could mean millions of people and thus make the threat to the free world ever so perilous.     Whether you agree or disagree with Ms. Ali's conclusions, it is a tragedy that she has to walk around with body guards in The United States of America. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has written a very important and courageous book.   Enjoy!
0739335359|5.0|I found the audiobook version of \\"Stormbreaker\\" at my local library.  It looked like a good story, so I checked it out and listened to it.  I was amazed.  Anthony Horowitz writes a superb story, and Nathaniel Parker is a wonderful narrator.  All of the foreign accents sound great, and the story moves along quickly, especially toward the end.   I suggest this if you like well-performed audiobooks.
0374105235|4.0|I purchased this book for my multi-disciplinary high school students to read - I, as well as they, found it sad, enthralling, yet potentially hopeful.  Beah's narrative left my students wanting to learn more and to find out what they can do to change global circumstances that can lead to the exploitation of children and their use as soldiers.
B000000XCK|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival, fighting their image as a singles-only band, delivered Pendulum; arguably, their best effort. The songs are high energy rock and roll with a flavor of jazz and country rock. Fogerty's experientation with new instruments, including the unpolished saxophone on Molina really work for CCR.    Internal bickering between the Fogerty Brothers and Fogerty and the rest of band are evident throughout, especially in the songs Hideaway, Have You Ever Seen The Rain? and Rude Awakening.    While this has been rated among their best works by critics, I think it falls short Willie and The Poors and Cosmo's Factory. But it is a solid performance.

0689853491|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book! I guess it's based on a song (that I have not heard), which explains the lyrical flow of the story. Regardless, it is such a fun book to read out loud. The first time I read it to my three boys (2, 4, 5), they begged me to read it again, and again. The next morning, my oldest hopped into bed with me and said, \\"Mommy I can read this book.\\" Then he \\"read\\" the story to me - actually he had memorized the chants. But he was so excited about being able to \\"read,\\" that it prompted him to jump into his schooling and really focus on learning to read!! This has become a favorite at our house, and we read it at least twice a week. All three of my boys take turns \\"reading\\" it too :)
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye West has never looked, sounded, or acted like anyone else in hip-hop, period. On \\"Everything I Am,\\" West name-drops his contemporaries for their decadent lifestyles: \\"I never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam / Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am / Let me know if you feel it man / 'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am.\\" Reluctant as I am to venerate diss tracks, he's right. Here is a rapper who risked his career to proclaim that President Bush hated black people on national television, who released an entire album produced by Jon Brion (producer/collaborator for Aimee Mann), and who started out life after higher education as a mid-level Roc-A-Fella producer who wore a polo shirt just to impress some sleazy record executives. Yes, he is known to sport jewelry and flashy clothing now and again, but no amount of bling can hide the sincere, vulnerable college dropout who kept on keeping on anyway.<br /><br />The allusion to school in West's discography strikes me as humbling in the rap game, where imperfection of any kind is verboten, but it's appropriate for an artist who spoke more about vying for the top than actually being there. Now he's attending his own Graduation, and fittingly enough, it's both his most confident and most subdued record, not to mention his leanest: Thirteen songs appear here, only two of which exceed five minutes. Graduation is also the least reliant on hip-hop clich&eacute;s; the closest sonic reference point is Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor, which didn't sound much like a hip-hop record anyhow. In the plasmatic, sparkling melodic backdrops plucked from a 1987 R&B smash, it's now possible to hear a Kanye West \\"sound\\"--previously obscured by guest producers--in full bloom.<br /><br />No Kanye West album would be complete without an opening salvo, and this time it's \\"Champion,\\" a ridiculously self-assured manifesto that obliterates any doubt about whether West believes he's made it. It feels like the second half of a story that began with Late Registration's \\"Touch the Sky,\\" in which West and Lupe Fiasco vowed that, someday, they would. But \\"Touch the Sky\\" is too loud, too blaring for West's attitude these days. Instead, \\"Champion\\" sports laid-back, sun-drenched keyboard lines that dare not to be catchy, and make great foils for West's verses celebrating modesty. \\"Stronger\\" is even more minimalist: Its melody is simply the vocodered parts of Daft Punk's \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" slowed down to syrupy speeds. By the time you reach the nearly all-piano \\"Everything I Am,\\" the message becomes clear: The music is a support for the lyrics, track for track.<br /><br />Those lyrics are typical West, if a bit more unambiguous this time around. The one place you would expect him to flaunt his status, he backs off. In \\"Champion,\\" he answers the call, \\"Did you realize that you were a champion?\\" with \\"Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib / Just a little something show you how we live / Everybody want it but it ain't that serious.\\" He does loosen his collar a bit on \\"Stronger\\" and \\"The Good Life,\\" though they're split by \\"I Wonder,\\" a song in which he talks about his hip-hop tenure as a gift from God. On \\"Drunk and Hot Girls,\\" West sings in defiantly slow speech, \\"We go through too much b******* to mess with these drunk and hot girls.\\" When I heard this, I fell sideways out of my chair. He said what? Clearly, this song and several others aren't going to play in too many Escalades on the way to the club; Graduation is as mature as the event it describes.<br /><br />West hasn't struck out once after three swings of the bat, but Graduation is not a perfect album. It's front-loaded, and loses steam by its last third, but it really misses the boat in its treatment of guest artists. Coldplay's Chris Martin doesn't make \\"Homecoming\\" any less lame, and his rather anonymous contribution can't be worth what West paid for it. Butter-smooth crooner Dwele is woefully out of place on the nervy \\"Flashing Lights,\\" especially in the context of his own jazz-tinged soul that's made him a quiet sensation. Mos Def--whose career seems to hit new lows with each passing year--actually sings on \\"Drunk and Hot Girls,\\" and ignominiously embarrasses himself. I admire West's instinct to branch out, but he'd do well to look at El-P's stunning I'll Sleep When You're Dead as an exemplar of how to dexterously assimilate disparate guests into one devastating sucker-punch.<br /><br />In fact, it would have been most appropriate for Graduation to be a guestless effort, because West's stamp is all over it: in the glistening music, in his clear and deliberate flow, in the messages that always feel well-deserved and never didactic. Considering that Graduation is the d&eacute;nouement of West's college-themed series (unless he releases a fourth album entitled Horror Stories from the Med School Library), it also sounds expectedly like a wave goodbye; \\"Big Brother\\" evokes rainbows and kids of all colors holding hands and singing \\"we are the children\\" in unison. Countless rappers would have used this opportunity to crank up the volume and pull out all the stops. Instead, Kanye West recorded his most definitive album, confidently strutting away from the limelight and smiling to us the whole time. It's an incredible way to bow out.e nervy \\"Flashing Lights,\\" especially in the context of his own jazz-tinged soul that's made him a quiet sensation.

0374105235|5.0|I agree with other reviews, this should be required reading in our public school system.  Mr. Beah elucidates an existence not known to Americans.      This memoir is strikingly candid, written in a style that transports you into his world.  The story begins in his village in Sierra Leone, with the everyday occurrences that breed familiarity.  Details such as how Mr. Beah recalls the lyrics of songs only pulls you deeper into the story, creating an emotional bond with the young boy of this memoir.  Just as suddenly, you become comfortable, and then the horrific tale of a struggle to live unfolds.  Mr. Beah is merely 12 when he loses his family due to war, never to see them again.  When you think this might be as horrible as it can get, as you run with him in the night, feel the pain in his chest, his feet, his heart, the absurdity only intensifies.  For anyone whom believes these conflicts in Africa are minor need only read this book once to change their minds.    It is difficult to stop reading this book, as the story is raw, genuine, and powerfully sad.  The storytelling history in Mr. Beah's village is evident in his writing, as every step, every shot, every snort of cocaine is felt if only vicariously by the reader.  It pains me now just to think of what I just read.  I am so glad that I did so.    You will be too.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|Not to long ago, I tried seeing Jaws again since I was a child and I liked the movie to my surprise.    As a child, I saw one little part of Jaws and was completely terrified. This time, I wasn't scared from it at all.    I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Spielberg films and isn't afraid of watching a ocean movie.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Well what can I say, I just love this movie. All-star cast, great script, a ton of action, and of course the cinematagraphy. A truly unique depiction of revenge. Quentin Tarantino is a guenius, with the whole amamation thing. All I can say is I wanna be Uma Thurman when I growup.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen and should be in the same group with \\"Life is beatiful\\". Unless you understand Russian you probably would not be able to get the entire meaning. I can not even think how translate it as it was real and strong \\"colloqual\\" Russian which is normally spoken. There few flaws with plot (mainly completely improbable events) but given that it is somewhat grotesque it is okay. I see no reason opposing movie to book as those are completely different planes and layers. Overall, of course it is 5+ movie. Thank you to all participants including Gogol Bordello.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|When David's album \\"On an Island\\" came out, I was a little skeptical.  It didn't blow my socks off (but of course it's better than the work by most other guitarists out there today).  Well, after seeing the album performed live in its entirety on this DVD, I have a greater appreciation for the album.  It's a superbly crafted piece of music, even with some of the lighter, fluffier lyrics.  Gilmour truly shows his brilliance as a guitarist.<br /><br />This 2-disc DVD is crammed full of material.  I bought the Best Buy version for $12, and it included an additional EP with a few live tracks.  The concert footage and sound quality are excellent.  David is joined on stage by David Bowie, David Crosby, and Graham Nash.  The concert is long and satisfying, and there are lots of extras, including behind the scenes footage and songs from other performances.<br /><br />This DVD is a beautiful piece of work, and it offers lots of material for the Gilmour and Floyd fan.  Enjoy.
0553277472|4.0|I had heard of  \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" by Robert Pirsig long before I read it.  But when someone compared some of my emails on Postfix mail servers to this book, I had to read it.  I am glad I did.    The one mistake people make with this book is thinking it has to deal with zen and motorcycle maintenance.  It has little to do with either, but under the author's name, in the sub title, the truth is exposed.    Pirsig's work is not some giant philosophical leap forward.  In fact, there are many earlier works that cover the same material as  Pirsig's with far more detail and accuracy!  But where they fail to make things digestible to a layman, Pirsig succeeds.    That is perhaps the one bad thing in \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\\"  He has made some mistaken quotes by simple mis-remembering, and hands them out as accurate information.  But even this is not terrible when you look at the overall goal of the book, to inspire people to examine quality in their lives.    I think that this book should be required reading in every high school.  There is a lot in there that people coming of age need to learn, and so rarely do.  The allegorical examination of quality through the tools of Zen and Motorcycles is very wonderfully written.  And with a teacher to correct the few misquotes, even the down side can be eliminated.    Now while I feel that Pirsig's viewpoint is somewhat polarized, I do not find that hinders the learning process or enjoyment involved in reading this book.      So please, read this book, even if you are interested in philosophy, zen, motorcycles, or quality.  You may be surprised about the other parts of your life that it touches on.
1582701709|1.0|I have a fairly extensive collection of insightful books that provide fantastic perspectives, useful tricks and tips, and practical ways to improve one's life and or perspective.  Obviously, The Secret had strong appeal to add to this collection.    The book was so bad, so empty of content, void of practical information, that I didn't want the book.  And I keep a lot of looser books.    Speaking to the educated reader: This book simply states that if you think about something, it'll happen.  So if I visualize myself winning the lottery, then I will.  One has to keep trying (see the definition of insanity), ignore the failures (tampering with the sample set), and relish in a small win (attributing meaning to a random event).  In a summary, talks about universal energy and how like attracts like... exactly the opposite of everything you know about how energy works.  My take on why this method works so well for the author is that there are plenty of gullible, unfulfilled people out there.      Speaking to the reader who believes in crystal healing power, views reality as your perception of it, and can feel the energy and connectivity between every living thing:  Oh this book is for you!  With it you'll be able to make your dreams come true and change your life - without even having to apply yourself!  Finally, you can have it all!  Just buy this book, after all, that money in your pocket is just a thing... an evil thing, ... so why not give let the author take it off your hands in exchange for cosmic power instead.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Seldom does a film come along that has somewhat \\"religious\\" overtones that does not somehow gender strong and polarizing opinions.Michael Apted and Patricia Heaton have done just that in their magnificently produced,directed,scripted and acted \\"biopic\\" on William Wilberforce, the Father of the Abolition of the English Slave Trade.The story of this courageous man and his uphill struggle to bring The Middle Passage Slave Trade to extinction is eye-catching,beautifully filmed and edited with A-listed English actors who totally inhabit their very demanding roles with finesse and sensitivity.The story is fairly presented and is not in the least \\"preachy\\" or over sentimental.Having studied the lives and times of the main characters in this film, I found the events to be accurate and well presented.Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce always can be expected to turn in a top drawer effort...and he does.Benedict Cumberbatch is a positive revelation as William Pitt.This film does not shy away from Wilberforce's Christianity as it was a part of the man;yet the film does not become overly religious so to make the man any more or less than he was.In fact, Wilberforce is presented in a very fair and balanced light.This film should not offend or discourage anyone whatever their belief system.This film focuses on the prevailing political system of the day and one man's determination to win freedom for Black Slaves.You will be well educated and inspired.A true 5+ star film.
1594489505|5.0|Fantastic book. If you liked the Kite Runner, you will be so thankful for another story so masterfully told. His characters are complex and so fully developed, and the story is evocative and powerful. This is a \\"must-read\\".
B00005JPTA|5.0|Many violent films have been made, but David Cronenberg is one of the few directors who can capture violence at its most raw and shocking. His newest film, \\"Eastern Promises,\\" depicts violence that's so brutal, I found myself ensnared in its grasp. For its heavy-handed subject matter and disturbing scenarios, this is easily one of the year's most engrossing films, an intense character-driven story of style, precision, and astonishing depth. Within the first five minutes, a man's throat is slashed while sitting in a barber's chair; already, we're anxious to learn what has happened, why it's happened, and what may come of it. There's a thrilling air of mystery to this film that pulls no punches, forcing the audience onto an emotional roller coaster of extreme speeds and perilous heights.    Taking place in London at Christmastime, the story begins when a pregnant Russian teenager walks into a local pharmacy--she soon begins hemorrhaging and is immediately rushed off to a hospital. She unfortunately dies, but the attending midwife, Anna (Naomi Watts), is able to save the baby. She then finds the young girl's diary, and while she's unable to read Russian, she does find the business card of a Russian restaurant. Anna goes to this restaurant hoping to find some answers. She meets Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), the middle aged owner. Right away, something doesn't seem right about this man; while he is accommodating, he's also detached and monotone, as if he has something to hide. These impressions get stronger when watching him react to the girl's diary. Nonetheless, Anna does need someone to translate. She'd rather not rely on her Russian uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski), who has an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.    As Anna's search intensifies, the more unsettling the truth becomes. As a godfather for the vory v zakone--a ruthless sect of the Russian mafia--Semyon is active in an underground sex trade, one that forces Eastern European teenage girls into a life of prostitution and drugs. Semyon's son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), is the family's enforcer, and his hotheaded arrogance is second only to his issues with his father. There's no question that he's a cold-blooded killer, yet it's quite possible that some degree of compassion is lurking somewhere underneath. When and where this side of him is revealed, I dare not say, but it effectively shows that even a member of organized crime is not beyond redemption.    The same can't be said for Semyon, whose true nature is venomous and disgusting. This is probably why Kirill is friendlier with the driver, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), a mysterious man aiming to become a full member of the vory v zakone family. A member shows his allegiance by getting his body covered with tattoos, the most important being a set of stars on both shoulders and both knees (a symbolic way of saying that he'll never bow down to anyone). According to a London detective, the tattoos of a Russian mobster tell a life story; I find this interesting, considering that the film's tagline--\\"Every sin leaves a mark\\"--is thrown into the mix.    Nikolai's life gets complicated when he crosses paths with Anna, who continues to pursue the Russian girl-mystery even as it gets dangerous. One gets the sense that she and Nikolai have an unspoken, unconscious understanding between them, in which one can acknowledge the other as a person instead of as a label. This isn't to say that Anna is trustful or unafraid of Nikolai--her eyes give away the fear, regret, and pain of the entire situation, not the least of which comes from Nikolai's involvement in her life. But his emotions run just as high, as he finds his loyalties divided between the vory v zakone and Anna. It doesn't help that war is immanent with a rival mafia family, and it shows its ugly side during an especially uncomfortable scene in which Nikolai is attacked at a bathhouse.    Weaving throughout the film is narration of the Russian girl, whosename was Tatiana (voiced by Tatiana Maslany); as she reads passages from her diary in English, both Anna and the audience get a much clearer picture of what happened to her and of just how horrible her circumstances were. At a certain point, Anna's affection for the baby grows strong, putting her life in even greater danger. It also endangers the life of her uncle, who understands just how dangerous a family the vory v zakone is. The more he translates from Tatiana's diary, the less comfortable he is letting Anna delve further into the mystery.    For whatever it's worth, it was a mystery I couldn't help but delve into. \\"Eastern Promises\\" has the kind of magnetic power few films have; it's a harsh, brooding thriller of impressive character, with a thought-provoking story and top-notch performances. This is especially true of Viggo Mortensen, whose performance is so believable that he practically disappears into the role. This is a fascinating, well-executed film--one of the year's best.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The BBC have excelled once more and \\"Planet Earth\\" will amaze you. I'm a biologist, have always been intersted in the natural world and watch all the natural history programs I can find. I thought it had all been done - but \\"Planet Earth\\" showed me new habitats and new creatures in breathtakingly beautiful images. Each frame is a work of art. But there's a lesson or two to be learned. First, patience and fortitude pay off - it took thousands of hours of initial research, and then searching and finding the perfect images (e.g. 55 days in a hide waiting for a male bird of paradise to dance for his mate). Secondly, our world is not just ours: we must share it responsibly for the benefit of all.
159562015X|5.0|I've been a senior leader of several organizations, and consequently have been exposed to a gauntlet of industrial psychologists, personality tests, intelligence tests, leadership training, cultural orientations, yada yada.    This book/body of knowledge/tool does 2 things extremely well. By well, I mean in an optimal way measured by the degree of understanding relative to the time investment. First, for an investment of maybe an hour at minimum, and an additional few hours to explore the guidance and begin to consider the implications and choose new behaviors, etc. you get, in my opinion, the best single, and correct perspective about yourself than any combination of the other methods mentioned above, period. It is not just directionally correct, like a horoscope type paragraph that would be true for anyone who read it, but rather a set of desciptions of your strengths that just \\"nail it\\" and descibe you as you know yourself. It tells you about yourself in a way that you can understand, regardless of whether you or anyone who is around you has ever articulated it.    The second thing it does well is offer a rational and empirically validated framework that is just long overdue. It is a simple truth that has been so elusive. It addresses a major reason why leadership is so rare in business - the modern organization strangles out your ability to contribute by trying to fix what you will likely never be much good at, or hate doing even if you end up with some level of proficiency at it.    Get it, read it (25 minutes) and take the online test (35 minutes). If you are like me and the 50 people around me who've infectiosuly taken and immediately recommended this thing to their inner circle of friends and family, you will absolutley find value in it. But like anything, an idea or a tool is only as good as it is put to use. A master craftsman never blames his tools. Remember to act on it and that is something for which only you can be responsible.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|I have rejected all my life the utilization of art to justify political ideologies and some people could see \\"The Life of Others\\" as a right wing pamphlet (specially those that still believe in the re-birth of socialism, Soviet style)...But this movie goes beyond the political implication to present the moral dilema of a basically decent human being  faced with the demands of his job as a represive agent of a totalitarian government...(and this could be \\"any\\" government or any entity that demands blind loyalty)...  It is a very good movie that sails against the ignorance of our youth and the indiference of the majorities...You could dismiss the political implications but I hope that the moral question will remain with you for a long time...!
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this CD.  I think the 'guys' are actually getting better in their singing and harmonizing but this set of songs were an odd and eclectic group that, overall, didn't feel like Il Divo.  This had both the high and low points for me with several just in the middle.  The song Una Noche was absolutely spectacular and was Il Divo at its best while Without You was totally unsuited to their style - since when does an Il Divo song do a 'fade' at the end.  Nights in White Satin actually bothered me at first, not because of their singing or arrangement, but because hearing such a well-loved and famous song sung in a foreign language took me aback.  After the initial shock, I was able to appreciate their rendition of this classic and it was truly lovely.  A few of the other songs seemed so similar, that it was hard to distinguish one from another, perhaps just because they lead with the spanish-style acoustic guitar intro and because I didn't understand the lyrics I found it difficult to differentiate them.  One song actually had a mariachi feel to it and it brought a smile to my face thinking of these voices in a mariachi band.  Overall, I think the CD was not quite up to the quality of the 2 previous ones simply because of song selection, but, for me, the one song, Una Noche, was so magnificent that is was worth the price of the CD. As another commenter has said, the producers need to give these magnificent voices something better to work with - the selections on this CD did not do them justice - but they are still Il Divo so buy it anyway.
1582701709|5.0|This is an excellent book for someone who needs a boost in life, and is feeling down in spirits.  A friend of my has discovered she has cancer and there is a part of the book on positive thinking regarding ones health, and she has found this very therapautic, and I am so glad that I got it for her.  For myself, I am usually a positive person, but there are still parts which are thought provoking for me.  It is not a book to read the whole way through, but to pick up from time to time for ideas on ways to steer your life along a new track or to tackle a problem from a different angle.  It helps you to see another point of view, it is like having a good friend to share your thoughts with.  My son recommended it to me, we are both very spiritual and believe that the mind is very powerful and that it is more important to touch a person mentally, than physically.  ie to share thoughts, and be on the same wave length.
B00005JODK|5.0|I'm 63...and my 14 year old granddaughter told me Thursday night to see this movie.  I'm sorry I waited so long.  I smiled all the way through the movie and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. The nonstop, upbeat music and talented stars took me back to the 60's...and Grease! (I smiled all the way through it, too!) Travolta has always been a great dancer, but to do it gracefully hauling around Edna's extra weight was a sight to see.  The fresh new faces were fun and Pfeiffer's thin frame was an excellent spoil for Blonski and a surprisngly svelte Queen Latifah.  All I can say is Fun, Fun, Fun!!!

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrell is Harold crick, an astoundingly precise and boring man who inexplicably finds that he's become the protagonist of a tragic masterpiece.  Working at the IRS, Will is a savant of numbers (his favorite word is \\"integer\\").  And then, without any warning, he comes to hear the words of a narrator, one who describes his life as he knows it (\\"but with a better vocabulary\\", he tells a sympathetic psychiatrist).  We soon learn that the voice belongs to a reclusive and morose author named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who suffers from writer's block and has know idea that the victim of her latest stillborn book is a living, breathing and wholly non-fictitious man.  How Eiffel has bridged the chasm between the fictional and the real (lets put aside the myriad puns here) is the least of Her and Crick's problems.  Eiffel is obsessed with tragedy, which requires her books to end in death.  Even before Crick identifies his executioner, he's already learned of his pending (if unspecified) death.    Unable to accept a psychological reason for his problem, he finds a college writing professor who (after some initial reservations) agrees to help Crick identify what kind of book he's in and perhaps avert an otherwise inevitably tragic end.  Played by Dustin Hoffman, Jules Hilbert boils Cricks' predicament down to either comedy or tragedy.  (Though facing death, working at the IRS skews things toward comedy.)  Not content to let the plot just come to him, Harold takes his quickly ending life by the horns - taking a vacation, learning how to play the guitar and hooking up with the victim of one his latest audits, a brash anarchist baker named Ana Pascal.  (Played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Ana seems determined to withhold %22 of her income taxes, the amount she generously believes goes to corporate bailouts and defense spending rather than building parks and filling potholes.)      WHAT WE THOUGHT: \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is a beguiling work, which is the polite way of saying that we had no idea whether to like it or not.      The idea of being the unwilling hero of a tragic novel by an oblivious author is an fascinating idea, but the holes in the conceit are soon revealed: Kay knows everything about Harold except for the part about Harold that knows that he's being \\"protagonized\\", and is oblivious about how much of her plot is driven by the fact of her narrative.  (In a great scene, Kay writes of Harold \\"Cursing the heavens in futility\\"; \\"No I'm not! I'm cursing you, you stupid voice!\\")  This becomes a plot hole when Harold responds by making life changes reflected in Kay's work, even though Kay has no idea that Harold is in on it.  The phrase \\"little did he know\\" used by Kay becomes a major plot point because Harold soon finds himself knowing more than Kay does.  Hilbert is a fun character, though the script makes him uninteresting for a big chunk of it, though giving him some of the weightiest and profound observations by the end.  \\"You have to die\\", he tells Harold - everybody dies, but the story will go on.  The script wisely goes further than you'd expect for a Hollywood movie - with Harold motivated to fall in love with Ana and otherwise shake off his stultifying anticlimactic life.  These things do happen, but \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is smarter than that, becoming a meditation on why writers narrow stories down to either tragic or comic, and the ends that they will go to stay within those bounds.  The major flaw of the story is that the concept (man learns he's a doomed fictitious character, and responds) is funnier and more engaging in the flick's first half.  Billed as a comedy, even its funnier moments are droll and slow.    WHAT WE LOVED.  Even when the story loses its steam, we still have great characters and great actors living them.  Gyllenhaal is great as Ana, compulsively combative as much as lovable.  Like one of her cookies, she's yummy and crunchy at the same time.  Will Ferrell is also a revelation as Crick - it's a worldaway from his other manic characters, and Ferrell inhabits him perfectly.    I may never decide whether I hated this flick or not, but I gave it four stars because, unlike other movies, I will never regret the time I spent watching it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.     What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.     Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under.

I never even noticed or gave a thought other than the way the \\"priest\\" was pulled through a sewer hole he didn't exactly fit through.<br /><br />An old relic of an abandoned church? or where ever the insides lead to.<br />To me the very high light was of the child with the clicking spoons and his mistaken idea that he had found a friend.<br /><br />Sorvino was a pretty, conscientious leading lady played as a sympathetic<br />character that became better as the movie progressed.  Why would they used human DNA in the mixed genetics of their bug?<br /><br />Is there really so many sub-tunnels under New York? that they built over the existing ones.  Other than that the mimicing roaches needed to be near a food supply [humans] there were lots of room to hide.<br />How come they didn't attack that group of weird ones the two boys passed in the tunnels.<br /><br />Charles S. Dutton is a favorite character to look for and enjoying his performance.  Recognized Josh Brolin - too bad his character met his end.<br /><br />Who, Who played the 6 foot tall roach. Person or artistic work - gruesome blend of parts to make a face.<br /><br />Old buildings and underground tunnels have always fascinated me - especially how they came to be.  Any other spooks around?  By the way how does one male get all those females - seems like they would have been protecting him.  Loved the way Sorvino psyched it out.  Smart cookie.<br /><br />The way it ended was so very touching and unexpected - have watched it 2 or 3 times already - probably again in another 6 months.<br /><br />Definitely not for youngsters - but is of great entertainment value.<br />Enjoy!
817224164X|5.0|First, a disclaimer: I do not advocate or support Hitler's ideas, but I recommend this book because so much of the world currently thinks this way and applies this philosophy or similar to issues of economy, immigration, international relations, and even their daily business and community lives.  Because Mein Kampf reflects the mindset of so many, from leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (President of Iran) down to the common American factory worker, it's important to realize that these ideas--as any really--are as dangerous as they are logical.<br /><br />Is this an evil book?  No.  We have several maniacs publishing books, sitting in places of political power, and with loyal followings on political talk shows whose ideas are as or more threatening to world order if they were allowed to reign.  And since you should understand those competing ideas for what they are, I recommend reading the father of them all--Mein Kampf.<br /><br />The most shocking thing about reading this book is that Hitler offers a very logical and appealing argument: that foreigners (the Jews in his time, but perhaps we could substitute the Chinese or Mexicans in ours, or we Americans if you are from Europe or the Middle East, or 'White' Afrikans in 'Black' Africa) are a threat to our wealth and welfare, the health of our society, that they are slowing taking over economically, that it's only a matter of time before they are a ruling, wealthy minority which will subjegate our culture and people--and that they must be stopped.<br /><br />After all, this has happened in other countries--you're bound to think--and isn't it happening today?  Wouldn't we be right to protect our interests against this imminent threat?  Of course, the answer is to irradicate them, seize their assets, erase all traces of their culture.  At the very least, doesn't Mein Kampf match very well with the idea of closing United States borders to all immigration, and deporting those who are not already citizens?  Hitler himself argues the point far better than any politician today--and boldly.<br /><br />Hitler does not come off as insane or evil.  He's preaching to the chior in his time and place, and it's not much of a stretch to say that this same argument would be very effective today.<br /><br />It's scary how convincing this book is, and that's exactly why you should read it.  Even if you, as I, may not agree with how he incorporated his political philosophy, it's a wake up call to read something by the individual who personified evil for nearly all of us and yet find that his ideas are considerably well thought out.r better than any politician today--and boldly.

B00005JPRF|1.0|The first RE intrigued me for the initial 10-15 minutes: why would the computer go nuts and kill everybody. The second RE had several plot holes but action-packed and, overall, entertaining (and, of course, had this hot cop-chick). But this third one is basically boring and the plot, if the first two assembles didn't manage to, will successfully insult your intelligence.    There's not much of a story, to tell about: after the T-Virus spread world-wide, for some reason, the Planet turned into a big desert... and it happened in just a few years as the main and returning cast still are young and healthy. Now, I haven't seen this Al Gore movie about the destruction of the eco-system, but, hell, it would take at least decades to have Las Vegas covered in 6-10 feet of sand. The Umbrella Corp is still operational and well, despite there is no industry, infrastructure, etc., left; they still conduct evil experiments despite there's no one left to buy their stuff (after all the f*** ups in the Hive, Raccoon City, destroying the Earth, etc., they could use some CEO's re-organization... pronto), On this scenario, a group of survivors wander the dessert, looking for gasoline and supplies, if there's any left. That's it.    The action sequences take place whenever the caravan stops for the required gas&supplies. There are zombies lurking everywhere... yep... Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins them later; she flies around with a couple of knives killing zombies and harness, once in a while, her unexplained telekinetic powers. There's some bang-bang action on the movie, but most of the secondary characters quickly die in Las Vegas, which is the second or third gas&supplies stop. Well, the thing is that Dr. Isaacs ambushed them with a zombie army... just one question here, how the hell Dr. Isaacs managed the zombies to wear the gray Umbrella overalls? I guess he just ask them kindly to wear those and the zombies replied \\"It was about time some one with manners asked us stuff.\\"    Bad movie, don't waste your time/money on it. If you are a gamer fan or something like it, believe me, it is also a waste of time for you; play Gears of War or something instead.

I listen to this while doing my college homework, as it is soothing and helps me to concentrate. I have his entire collection now and must say, that his albums are almost as good as seeing him perform in person! With the holiday season fast approaching, this album would make a fantastic gift for almost everyone on your list. In fact, even my 13 year old neice adores him.

B00005JPRZ|5.0|It's a very funny film.  If you're in the mood to laugh, go see this hysterical romp about a man trying to give his late father a dignfied funeral that quickly turns into a living nightmare.  Great performances from the entire cast, especially Alan Tudyk (who reveals a very nice backside--I can say that on Amazon, can't I?--in case that may interest you; he also delivers a performance of comic perfection--I LOVED him), Daisy Donovan, Matthew MacFadyen and Peter Dinklage.  If I laugh out loud during a film, that's a very good sign--and I was quite vocal during this flick.  \\"Death at a Funeral\\" is a cross between an old-fashioned screwball comedy (think \\"Bringing Up Baby\\") and a pitch black comedy (think \\"Harold & Maude)--it's delightful--if you have this kind of twisted sense of humor.  I do--and I highly recommend you go see this film right now or watch it when it comes out on DVD!
B0002YLC24|5.0|After seeing the movie partially on cable, I decided it was something I would like to own and be able to watch whenever the mood strikes. When I realized it was the sequel to Before Sunrise, I went down to the library and checked out that DVD as well. Hawke and Delpy pick up right where they left off in Before Sunrise. Obviously both matured and, with slightly different perspectives on life, are still very much the same two people from the original movie. Their rediscovery of each other and the scenery of back street Paris worked beautifully. Their candid and witty conversation kept my interest through the whole movie.  To consider that after nine years a couple who spent one beautiful night falling for each other while walking through the streets of Vienna and lost contact could have those feelings once again seems a bit of  a stretch, but the romantic in me wants to believe it.  Linklater does a wonderful job convincing me of just that.  Enjoy it.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.<br /><br />The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre's [[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]]. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.<br /><br />Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich M&uuml;he's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called \\"Sonata for a Good Man\\". It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola`s classic surveillance thriller, [[ASIN:B00003CX9I The Conversation]]. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.<br /><br />The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, \\"Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark\\". There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes.elf. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|Any way you look at it, this DVD package is a great value for the money - the sticker on the outside says it all - \\"Over 5 hours of footage plus bonus content, including additional tracks, music videos, documentaries and photo gallery.\\"  Given the wide variety of songs,  it's difficult to characterize this DVD.  I guess you could say this is a combination of the heartfelt On An Island songs, with Pink Floyd classics.  A considerable amount of work went into it - there is something here for everybody.<br /><br />Director David Mallet (who also did the highly acclaimed Pink Floyd Pulse DVD) has put together a great mix of shots from the many cameras in the Royal Albert Hall, and which combines a selection of clear shots of the band with the artsy/abstract ones (I especially liked the closeups of Gilmour's fingers working the guitar).  This is not Pulse (an arena extravaganza show), but rather a rendering of the On An Island tour show which was geared for theaters (many lights all around the stage, lots of smoke, and some lasers during the later Floyd songs).  This show is more moody and personal, with more feeling, than an in-your-face arena show.  More about the people and the music - more genuine or intimate in a way (I do love arena shows too).  It was filmed at the end of the tour, so the band had the songs down to perfection (and this is the best from the 3 nights of Albert Hall shows).  They obviously enjoyed doing it.  Amazon provides a good example of the video with their excerpt from Breathe.<br /><br />David's band includes Richard Wright from Pink Floyd, Phil Manzanera from Roxy Music (an excellent addition, who also co-produced and played in the OAI CD), Jon Carin, Guy Pratt, and Steve DiStanislao.  Guests include David Crosby and Graham Nash, David Bowie, and Robert Wyatt.<br /><br />Disk One is all concert, and is a full 2 ½ hours long (no filler breaks between songs, like on some DVDs - Sir Paul are you listening?!).  Songs are:  Speak To Me, Breathe, Time, Breathe, Castellorizon, On An Island, The Blue, Red Sky at Night, This Heaven, Then I Close My Eyes, Smile, Take A Breath, A Pocketful of Stones, Where We Start, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, High Hopes, Echoes, Wish You Were Here, Find The Cost Of Freedom, Arnold Layne (w/Bowie) and Comfortably Numb (w/Bowie).  The performance of Echoes (23 minutes) is worth getting the DVD alone.  The fast moving band silhouettes during the strobe sequence of Take A Breath are brilliant.  Bowie makes Comfortably Numb his own.<br /><br />Disk Two has lots of extras:  30 minutes of Albert Hall extras (Wot's Uh The Deal, Dominoes, Wearing The Inside out, Arnold Layne (w/Richard Wright) and Comfortably Numb (w/Richard Wright)); Europe tour documentary; Dark Globe performance from the tour; acoustic studio Echoes (not listed); Astronomy Domine (Abbey Road); This Heaven (AOL sessions); BBC Mermaid Theatre concert (Castellorizon, On An Island, The Blue, Take A Breath, High Hopes); Making of OAI documentary; West Coast tour documentary; music videos (On An Island & Smile), Island Jam 2007; a photo gallery.<br /><br />There has been talk of Easter Eggs.  The \\"hidden\\" material I'm aware of are a 7-minute fun acoustical studio version of Echoes that runs right after Dark Globe on Disk Two, and that you can click Enter when the wire-man appears during the documentary for extra material (love to know if there's anything else - comments?).<br /><br />The package is a tri-fold digipak, containing two DVDs and a 20-page booklet.  The booklet is a cool collection of photo collages, including lots of band pics, news clippings, and tour paraphernalia.  Audio options are Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital Stereo.  Amazon also shows a Blu-ray version of the DVD coming out later this year (the concert was filmed in high definition).<br /><br />Overall, this is a generous package by one of rock's greatest guitar masters - excellent music, audio and video - highly recommended!

0743289684|5.0|It is rare to find autobiography as absorbing as this. Not only because of the author's unusual path from the desert of Somalia to the USA via the Netherlands, but also on account of the engaging writing style. Clear and descriptive, the narrative of her eventful life had a profound impact on this reader. Born and raised in Somalia, she spent part of her youth in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, describing through the eyes of a child what it was like to live there.<br /><br />She makes the history of Somalia come alive under the dictatorship of Siad Barre, explaining the clan system and comparing the relaxed Muslim practice in that country with the strictness of Saudi Arabia and the hypocrisy and racism that go along with it. The short experience of Ethiopia and later the long stay in Kenya, both predominantly Christian countries, were different again and she really captivates one's attention with the places and the people. One of the most salient memories she recalls is the obsessive anti-Semitism in Saudi Arabia. Where her family lived in the city of Riyadh, Jews were blamed for everything.<br /><br />A sub-theme of the book is the increased radicalization of Muslims, partly because of the failures and the suffering brought about by Barre and the chaos of the civil war that unseated him. She noted this radicalization taking place amongst Somalis and others in Kenya where she spent most of her adolescence. This radical strain was brought to Africa by Arabs and Iranians, both Sunni and Shia, also reflecting the failure of secular ideologies and bad government in the dictatorships of the Muslim world.<br /><br />There are sympathetic but honest portrayals of her family and friends: her mother who showed healthy signs of independence early in life but eventually lost hope and became embittered, her loving and tolerant but mostly absent father, her brother who stayed in Kenya and her sister who, when she couldn't cope in Holland, died tragically after returning to Kenya.<br /><br />Instead of stirring up feelings against Islam, this book makes one contemplate the location of each individual's birth, how little free choice there really is in a closed society, the powerful hold of your community's history and culture, the difficulty of resisting brainwashing and how grateful people in free societies ought to be for the blessings that a lot of us take for granted.<br /><br />The book is also about a second journey - the one from a stifling experience of oppressive religion to enlightenment and an embrace of Western values like individual freedom, freedom of speech and the rule of law. The fact that the individual mattered and had a right to life, to choice and freedom, was a joyful discovery.<br /><br />This theme interweaves with the history she so deftly chronicles: the collapse of Somalia, the slow decline in Kenya, Dutch politics in the face of dysfunctional multiculturalism that however well intended, harms individuals in the immigrant communities and society as a whole. More information of what is going down in The Netherlands and Europe as a whole is available in [[ASIN:0767920058 While Europe Slept]] by Bruce Bawer and [[ASIN:1400097703 Menace in Europe]] by Claire Berlinski.<br /><br />It is humbling to read of the author's wonderment at Holland where even the police were friendly and helpful, and everything worked. She clearly loves The Netherlands; her words radiate with gratitude and appreciation of Dutch culture and society. I especially enjoyed the account of her studies at the University of Leiden where she discovered the great Western philosophers.<br /><br />Infidel is the story of a life that has experienced mutilation, war, deprivation, tragedy, adventure, drastic adaptation and inspiring achievements, by an unusually courageous, empathic and resourceful individual. There are 11 black & white plates of family and other people who played a part in her life. As far as leaving Islam is concerned, I recommend the following informative books by two equally courageous women: [[ASIN:0312358377 Because They Hate]] by Brigitte Gabriel and [[ASIN:1595230319 Now They Call Me Infidel]] by Nonie Darwish.ly courageous women: [[ASIN:0312358377 Because They Hate]] by Brigitte Gabriel and [[ASIN:1595230319 Now They Call Me Infidel]] by Nonie Darwish.

B00006EXDM|5.0|let me be clear all this music is first rate. however the price of 35$ even for a double disc is extreme especially when its in its original format meaning  that when this was released in 1971 it was released on two lp because they could only hold 50 min of music and each lp had about 45 min on their. cd's can hold 80 mon of music meaning that all they had to do was cut the 10 min version of midnight rambler and maybe one more track and they could fit this one disc and cut the price in half. or if they were going to keep it in 2 disc fromat they could have updated it with bonus tracks from more hot rocks adding songs im free , not fade away, little red rooster  and filled out the two disc or made it into a three disc. but no they just try to screw you. but all that aside the music is great and if price doesn't bother pick it up. if it does check out 40 licks compilation

1594489505|5.0|Wow.  Hoseeeini's first novel, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" completely moved me and left me breathless.  I was sort of skeptical that he would be able to create another work that  would have a similar effect on me.  I have to admit though, he's done it again.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" covers the same historical timeframe that \\"The Kite Runner\\" did, however this time its told from a woman's perspective.<br /><br />Set against the last thirty years of turmoil in Afghanistan, the story revolves around two very strong and very different Afghani women.  They lead completely different lives until one tragic incident throws them together.  The first half of the book allows us to get to know each of these women, who they are, where they come from, what their lives are about.  The second half is almost like a new story, as the two drastically different women come together in their fight for survival.<br /><br />The story is incredible.  I couldn't put the book down.  There were moments I actually held my breath and said a quick prayer for the characters' well being before I turned the page to start the next chapter.  It's honest and raw, historically its quite accurate, and its incredibly moving and endearing.  If you enjoyed Hosseini's first book, you won't be disappointed by \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  Khaled Hosseini is a brilliant and very talented author.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|A FANTASTIC representation of a performance that will live in the history of music and Royal Albert Hall.<br /><br />Recommended for all David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Phil Manzanera (Roxy Music), and Pink Floyd Fans.  Every performance is formidable, every video translates the excitement impressively; the viewer becomes a part of the experience.  Who could ask for more from a video?<br /><br />Comments from other reviews indicate that the video was less than PAR.  The concert was very dark and the lighting was a challenge.  The creative editing draws the viewer into the experience and is so well synchronized with the audio that you can become a part of the performance.<br /><br />My favorites:  \\"Take a breath\\" and \\"Echoes\\".  If you appreciate these works, you have got to see this DVD.<br /><br />And, by the way, the price is FANTASTIC!  It's hard too find locally, seems to have sold out immediately.  For a double DVD with memorable features, the price is worth it.

I was not sure how well it would hold up at first but after two years and a lot of abuse (pulling tabs to hard and having the monsters chase little hands) it is still in great condition.  EXTREMELY well made pop-up book with little people in mind.
0753821788|5.0|(4.5 stars) One of the most delightful and original satires I've read in ages, this debut novel pokes fun at every aspect of British society, from government spin-meisters and crass politicians to marriages of convenience, TV interview programs, consumerism, and the belief that many of the world's problems would be solved if only other people were \\"more like us.\\" This satire is particularly refreshing, however, since the author writes it with a smile on his face, preferring to prick balloons with his witty needling, rather than wield a rapier in a slashing attack.<br /><br />The absurdity begins on the first page, when mild-mannered and unimaginative Dr. Alfred Jones, a fisheries specialist, receives a letter asking for his participation in a project to introduce Scottish salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into the wadis of the Yemen during the yearly rains. Alfred finds the whole idea ludicrous and ignores the letter, until the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and eventually the prime minister weigh in. The PM's office favors this effort for its \\"environmental message,\\" the new links it will forge to a Middle Eastern country, and not incidentally, the huge, positive news story that may push stories of Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia off the front page.<br /><br />Through letters, e-mails, memos, diary entries, newspaper articles, records of the House of Commons, interviews, and even intercepted al-Qaeda e-mail traffic, the story of Alfred's efforts to create a suitable environment for salmon in the mountains of western Yemen unfolds. Gradually, Alfred becomes intrigued with the research possibilities of the project, and his contact with His Excellency Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, an avid salmon-fisherman who lives part of the year on a Scottish estate, broadens his vision and stimulates his imagination.<br /><br />Within the framework that includes the salmon project, Alfred's love life (or lack of love life, since his wife lives in Geneva), and the sheikh's broad vision of a more peaceful world achieved through fishing, the author pokes fun at modern life--government officials who take credit for all Alfred's work, foreign policy which reflects the belief that the Middle Eastern poor hate the British because they do not have TV and material benefits, and even a communications expert who proposes a \\"Voice of Britain\\" TV channel with a quiz show in which poor Iraqi contestants can win dishwashers. Not even the British army's \\"Bereavement Management Center\\" escapes the author's sharp eye.<br /><br />As Alfred accepts the sheikh's \\"belief in belief,\\" he grows emotionally, and when the prime minister insists on going to the Yemen for the first release of ten thousand young salmon into the wadi, the scene is set for a grand finale. Filled with timely observations, an entertaining cast of characters, and a unique and well-developed story line (though the conclusion is a bit weak), this novel breaks new ground. There are not many satires that can be called \\"charming,\\" and there may be even fewer novels about salmon fishing that can completely captivate those of us who have never climbed into a set of waders.

B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall is a jazz genius. She has that very rare gift--an emotional depth that matches a prodigious musicianship. To call her a phenomenon is not an exaggeration. Every cut on this album is an absolute stone cold gem.<br /><br />I admit that part of me has a problem recommending this album. It's not because I think it's not good enough--it's because I think in a way it might be too good.<br /><br />Let me explain.<br /><br />I'm concerned that folks who are new to Miss Krall's oeuvre might buy this album, and only this album, thinking that now they have all of the best of her work. That would be tragic. People, there's a lot more where this came from.<br /><br />To those of you who are Diana newbies, please please please don't let this be your only Diana Krall CD. Every one she's ever recorded is brilliant. Rather, let this be your starting point. If you were to ask me which of her albums would make a great second purchase, I'd strongly recommend \\"Live in Paris\\", from 2002. It's not only a terrific live CD, but there's a wonderful DVD of the same concert. I'm fortunate to own both.
B000RJO578|5.0|I liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD but somehow I didn't rush out to see this one when it hit the theaters, maybe the title was too blah and the premise too confusing; it's a high concept picture all right, but somehow the concept was a little over my head.  Anyway thank heavens for DVD where I could stop and pause and ask \\"What did he say?\\" without making too much of a ninny of myself.  Simon Pegg is twice as good here as he was in the zombie movie, and Nick Frost keeps up with him every step of the way.  (There's a cute DVD extra in which the two play up, and over the top, the homoerotics of the script--and the script, by inference, of all the buddy action movies the film is satirizing.)  Pegg is extraordinary in his affect, heck, I'd hire him for a real action adventure!  It's a strange movie in that it doesn't even have the merest hint of a romance for our hero (maybe that's why Danny, the constable played by Frost, gets so much of Pegg's amorous energy).<br /><br />Among the big (by British standards) names hired here to make supporting appearances, Jim Broadbent doesn't seem like they let him 100% into the joke, but Tim Dalton does his very best sly Alan Rickman as the manager of the local supermarket, Skinner, the man who becomes the leading suspect in a series of murders almost immediately.  It seems so obvious he had something to do with it, but if I were Timothy Dalton, would I bother cloaking my beauty with a the hooded cowl of a grim reaper?  That's how I knew it wasn't him!  It just wasn't making sense.  Billie Whitelaw, Samuel Beckett's favorite actress, has a blink and you'll miss her part, shame in a way because she can be very very funny and they might have given her more to do.  Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, all play little bit parts rather the way that Bing Crosby shows up in ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, perhaps as a gesture of goodwill rather than actually contributing anything of substance.  It's the kind of movie you wind up watching twice or three times to catch the hundreds of zany verbal and visual cues and jokes you missed first time around.  The mystery plot isn't much, and Ira (STEPFORD WIVES) Levin, if he's still alive, is probably consulting with his plagiarism lawyers right now, but it's all in good fun and I hope the team continues for another round, next time I'll make it to the cinema opening night, instead of waiting for the DVD release.<br /><br />Oh, avoid those deleted scenes--yet again you see why editors make tthe big bucks and the writers, not so much.es to catch the hundreds of zany verbal and visual cues and jokes you missed first time around.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am a Grandmother, and I just love supernatural shows, and this one is<br />really well done. And the guys arn't bad to look at either.<br />It's nothing like Charmed, or Buffy. So much better.<br />I remember seeing Jensen Ackles first on Days of Our Lives.
B00005JPRD|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />I`m pleased to report that \\"Across the Universe\\" isn't nearly as insufferable as I had expected it to be.  As a diehard Beatles fan, my initial trepidation was not wholly without warrant, seeing that the one previous attempt at crafting a movie around the Fab Four's oeuvre was the kitschy, lamentable \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" as bad a film as has ever stunk up the inside of a movie theater.  Faced with such an appalling precedent, I certainly did not have high hopes for this latest endeavor, which, from its previews, looked to be another Beatles-inspired travesty in the making.<br /><br />The good news is that \\"Across the Universe,\\" written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Julie Taymor (\\"Titus\\"), never sinks to the level of that earlier fiasco, although it does come perilously close a few times - mainly in the second half of the film when it lapses into pseudo-psychedelia of the worst kind.  But, luckily, that doesn't happen very often, and much of the film is surprisingly sweet and charming in its intentions and approach.<br /><br />It's the early 1960's, and a scruffy Paul McCartney look-alike named Jude (Jim Sturgess) leaves his home in Liverpool to find meaning, adventure and purpose in America.  While there, he falls in love with Lucy (Evan Rachel Ward), a beautiful young blond who becomes actively involved in the antiwar movement when her fiance is killed in battle and her brother is shipped off to fight in Vietnam.  Their love story is played out against the backdrop of the turbulent `60's, a time of free love, flower-power fashions, peace demonstrations, drug use, and anti-establishment radicalism, all of which find their way into the fabric of the film.<br /><br />The Beatles' canon, which served as the perfect soundtrack for that extraordinary era, is so uniquely rich in songwriting material that each fan is sure to find something to carp about regarding which songs the filmmakers have chosen to put into their film and which they've opted to leave out.  I would have preferred more selections from the band's earlier period and slightly fewer from their later, even though I realize that the latter provide the kind of narrative richness and thematic depth around which a group of filmmakers can more easily construct a full-bodied story.<br /><br />Most of the songs are seamlessly sewn into the narrative, although there are times when we can sense the scenarists stretching the material to make a certain song fit.  For instance, there's a character named Prudence who serves no real function in the story other than to give the other characters a chance to sing \\"Dear Prudence\\" to her (\\"Jude\\" and \\"Lucy\\" are marginally more forgivable since they are at least the names of the main characters in the movie).  \\"Across the Universe\\" works best when it keeps its vision simple and close to everyday life.  Conversely, it runs into the most trouble when it edges towards surrealism and stylization, often slipping over into pretentiousness and self-indulgence when it does so.  Taymor exploits her trademark fascination with puppetry and masks, but the visions she creates with them often feel outdated, cheesy and campy.  Particularly egregious is an ill-conceived scene featuring Eddie Izzard as a Timothy Leary-inspired Mr. Kite, a sequence that has the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" movie imprimatur stamped all over it.  Bono doesn't fare much better as Dr. Robert, trapped as he is in one of the most poorly shot psychedelic nightmares since the Beatles' own \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" movie from 1967.<br /><br />Still, these are minor lapses in a movie that is often funny, touching and captivating in its own right.  Most of the credit, of course, goes to the Beatles themselves whose songs are so musically rich and lyrically resonant that they can both define a specific era and literally reach out across the universe at one and the same time.  With their film, Taymor and her crew have captured a good deal of thattimelessness.

B000VT55G4|1.0|I'm a fan of both Morgan Freeman and John Cusack. But this film does them little justice. Mainly the poor script and amateur supporting cast ruin what could have been an interesting movie. Worth it to watch on a rainy day, for free. Do not pay to see this movie.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I purchased this video series along with my HD-DVD player.  The quality is outstanding!  I now own several HD-DVD movies, but this series still beats everything else.  The video quality is truly something to behold.    If you want to see the best quality of both your HD-DVD player and your HD television, you must buy this series!       REALLY...I had no idea it would be this good!
B000QXDED6|2.0|I'm a fan of action movies, including the ones that dab into a little history, though I just couldn't get into this one. A little too monotonous (<---excuse the spelling!) for me though the cinematography was good. I hate to say it but, I'm glad I waited for this to come out on DVD rental.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Truth is, thi is one of the most endearing and human records Knopfler has ever created - on a par with the scores from Cal and Local Hero, and as poignant as Ragpicker's Waltz. It just is down to very real stories about very real characters who suffer, much as the protagonist in \\"heart full of holes\\". These are songs that will not reduce you to tears but leave you thinking long after they have ended. Knopfler is down to a basic quartet this time as well : Guy Fletcher and compadres are all the accompaniement he needs. What few guests there are absolutely add something shimmering to the quality of this recording. There are no numbskull duest with the King of Ponce, Sting, or rehashes of paeans to poolside twisting, mtv, ray kroc or whatever else he was on to when stumped for legitimate inspiration.<br />Instead the stories flow seamlessly from the tattoo artist paean to love that will never fade through to the borrowed Irsih lament that infuses the bird and the fish right to the very last tune. Perhaps time with EmmyLou Harris reminded him of telling a genuine story and how powerful that can be on its own terms. There is no flash, no hooks, just great, great songwriting and genuine stories. In the end, as this came to a conclusion, I thought that this might be the greatest example of songwriting this side of Gordon Lightfoot - real people, real lives, genuine human pathos. It doesn't get any better. Kudos to Knopfler.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|The first ten to fifteen minutes are a little slow as you start to understand what is about to happen.  After that it is a non-stop ride to the end.  This is why I go to the movies.  For once there is a movie that I actually thought was worth paying the $9 to see.  I walked out of the theatre just thinking, \\"wow..... wow..... wow....\\".<br /><br />If you have any love of the spy genre then you really need to check this one out.  It blew my doors off.
078322737X|4.0|The movie is as great as I remembered.  However, the sound is terrible.  When you get the volume adjusted to where you can hear the voices, the music blasts you out.  If you adjust the volume to the music, you can't hear the talking.
0751532711|4.0|I was told to buy this book from someone whom I skate with who has a house that looks like a hotel. Ok enough said on that.     This book is for the person who's lived their life believing that they have to work for someone else and get a salary and be productive their whole life. The average working way to think about making money. This book tells you how to think differently about whole the idea of making money. This book won't tell you how to make a single cent, but rather how to notice opportunities and strike when the average person would stand back and say \\"you're crazy for doing this\\".  Notice a trend in thinking here, the crazy people who did stuff when no one else did are the ones who are usually wealthy in a short period of time compared to the one who's tied to their office hoping for a raise of some kind or recognition.
0736420959|3.0|Of course this is a great story- but this abridged version doesnt quite flow if you dont already know the story.  The language is also a little 'old'. I have to censor it a bit for my 3 year old. The Disney pictures however are great, and if you have the energy to 'tell' the story rather than 'read' it then this works great.

B00005ATQF|5.0|This 1987 Film, \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is about my favorite War Film of all time. My other top favorites's are \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" & \\"Objective Burma\\". I'm so very surprized & disappointed that this great film was never released in the Widescreen Format in English. Does anyone know why this film has never been released in Widescreen --(English Version)? Anyway the Bootcamp training is exactly the way it is in the real world of the US Military. This is one reason why I rate this film at the very top of all war film's ever made. Extremely Authenic.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|The problem with movies like this is that many people today don't bother to read books, particularly classic works like Bram Stoker's novel _Dracula_, which have been adapted into movies many times.  There is no reason this movie couldn't have been a faithful adaptation of Stoker's book.  Instead, what we get is 20 or so minutes worth of a faithful adaptation, and then a romantic drama with occasional bursts of faithfulness to the book.  In the novel, there is not even a SUGGESTION of a romance between Mina and Dracula, not even a HINT that he was interested in her (or Lucy, or anyone else) for more than a meal.  Personally, I think Stoker would have been offended by this movie.  If you want fidelity to the book, try \\"Bram Stoker's Count Dracula\\", directed in the 1970s by Jess Franco and starring Christopher Lee, or the BBC's \\"Count Dracula\\" with Louis Jourdan.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Inland Empire is a mesmerizing work of cinematic art. The film is highly creative,  probing and reflective, especially about the self as artist, as actor. Lynch is an actor's director and he takes the craft to heart in a magnificently conscious manner. The sets, and especially cinematography, are extraordinary and meticulously designed. Lynch knows his film history yet has utilized the  past and its artists to move beyond the present, even the future, as the magician in him has reworked time itself on the screen.

This movie employed incredible special effects, great casting, and superb acting.The ending also allows for a sequel with Luthor present.

Fantastic new cover art and inventive presentation make this little beauty pretty before you even open the box! The DVD menu's a tad simple, just taken from the original release and removed the cast faces whizzing by. I still think there are a few deleted scenes that should have been included (Stuff on Miranda that everyone's seen in blooper footage), but the new commentary makes up for almost any faults I can find. Joss, Summer, Adam, Ron, and Nathan are fantastic as they go through the entire movie and reminisce 4 years back into their chance to keep flying. Cheers to you guys, we got our Big Damn Movie!

0142403881|5.0|Roald Dahl is one of my favorite authors of all-time but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has so many elements to the book that make it so great.  I think this book would be perfect for middle school kids because of the fantasy part of the book that gets kids thinking beyond what they perceive reality as, it gets them thinking outside the box.  Another thing that this book builds is curiosity, in the book the kids are curious to see what is really inside the factory.  There is never a boring part of the book.  This book also teaches the point of never giving up because Charlie finally won the golden ticket.  A great book...
B000AP04OM|5.0|This has always been the all time favorite movie of my husband and I, we have watched it on video for years.  I thought it was about time to upgrade to the DVD since we now have a big screen digital TV.  We  were struck by the huge difference this DVD is from the poor quality of the video version...it's amazing!  The colors are vibrant and the sound has much improved as well.  Even our 11 year old son who watched it for the first time enjoyed it.  I'm quite certain it will remain as our all time favorite movie!

156224003X|5.0|The ideas in this book about self-awareness and practicing music are so profound -- and so true -- I've read this book three times this year.    Werner describes the thought process behind becoming a jazz musician.  No one has previously described the mental pitfalls and hangups more clearly, sometimes it's like he has transcribed dialogue from ones own head.  This book has made a difference in my playing and outlook, and for some of my friends.    For these reasons, I can't recommend this book enough (even if I disagree with him that meditation is the primary solution to the problems he describes).

Tracks like \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\", \\"The World is Yours\\" and \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" drive you into a world where only your mind can go and feel like it's in paradise. You may think I'm exaggerating or I'm giving it too much praise but it's that good for any person that enjoys listen to real Hip Hop. It's no doubt in my mind that this desrves a full 5 stars. The second disc is more of a extra track list since the reason I bought this album was for much greater quality compared to it's original CD release. More bass for the car.

B000RG1FMO|4.0|Graduation is the third album in Kanye West's discography. Once you listen to this album, you'll be catching yourself dragging back to it everytime you turn on your MP3 Player/Computer/Car stereo. Graduation has a lot of what we need in Hip Hop right now. Kanye isn't a full fledged MC like say Nas or Jay but he's close to it in the category of \\"rapper\\". Graduation has a large category of beats that will leave you memorized. The lyrical contains isn't as heart pounding as his last solo project \\"Late Registration\\" but it dosen't tag behind too much of a distance. Songs like \\"Flashing Lights\\", \\"I Wonder\\" and \\"Big Brother are what make the album sound so great. If you liked Kanye's past efforts then this one is defiantly worth a listen.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  The only disappointment came when it ended... it left me wanting more!<br />It is different than most mainstream movies.  This is an enlightening movie that reaches into the science of new age philosophies.  If you are familiar with the 4th deminsion, chakras, and human energy fields, then this movie won't be much of a stretch for you.  If you are new to all this, you may or may not \\"get it\\".  I think this movie does a great job in explaining the thought process behind the plot.  I think it's just a great movie!  It's something most people haven't seen before, and something that I think would be good for everyone to see and think about.  It carries a very powerful and positive message!<br />I highly recommend it!<br />Sharon

I even saw the tour for this album at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Joe Walsh, promoting his \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" tour opened and remained to play in the Manassas sets. So you can imagine what a great concert it was. To me, both albums are essentials.
0780624157|4.0|THE BEST OF WCW'S HALLOWEEN HAVOC (1998)<br />approx. 55 minutes<br /><br />This is a decent compilation of one of my favorite annual pay-per-views, Halloween Havoc.  This was supposed to be the \\"spooky\\" themed PPV and this made many of the matches more gimmicky and bizarre.  The wrestling audience nowadays is \\"too smart\\" to have a sustained interest in this type of PPV, but I still miss the event.<br /><br />Anyhow, the tape features matches from 1989 all the way up to 1997.  You will recognize many faces, including WCW mainstay Sting, Ric Flair, Mick Foley and Hogan in both incarnations.  You will recognize many voices too, including Jim Ross, Mike Tenay, Jesse Ventura, Bobby Heenan, Dusty Rhodes and intros from Michael Buffer (you know... \\"Let's get ready to rumble!!!!\\" guy).  But what's great about this tape is the people you may have forgot.  Hardcore legends Terry Funk and Abdullah the Butcher, Japanese star Great Muta, and monster heel Vader all make appearances.  You can also see Scott Hall as \\"the Diamond Studd\\" and Macho Man in his \\"Slim Jim\\" duds.  Mean Gene Okerlund sort of hosts the tape, meaning he appears three times explaining first that the tape is beginning, next that the section on Hogan is beginning and finally that the tape is over.<br /><br />One of the best characteristics of Halloween Havoc was that there was almost always an off-the-wall type of match each year.  For example, in the \\"Chamber of Horrors\\" match, the object is to put a member of the opposing team into an electric chair.  Many of the matches on this tape are cage matches.  Don't forget about Jake and Sting's \\"coalminer's glove match\\", which was selected by spinning a \\"price is right\\"-type wheel.  And then there's the interferences, including a mysterious masked man hitting Sting and Jimmy Hart with a club in one match and then Sting switching places with another Sting early on (?!).<br /><br />I'll devote a whole paragraph to the weirdest clip on the tape:<br />Another match which isn't as successful was the \\"Monster Truck Sumo\\" match which featured Hogan and the Giant running the big trucks into each other, only to have Hogan accidentally throw Giant off a building.  In the storyline, Giant was angry at Hogan for defeating \\"his father\\" (a reference to Andre the Giant, who wasn't related to his in real life).  The two later meet for a very weird match where Hogan is wearing black tights with lightning bolts about 9 months before his heel turn at Bash at the Beach '96!  He is also donning \\"Taskmaster\\"-style facepaint, explained by the announcers as \\"the dark side of Hogan\\".  The match ends with several people running in, including one of the silliest characters in wrestling history \\"the Yeti\\".  He was a very tall mummy who wrapped his arms around his opponent as he twitched!  To quote Mike Tenay, \\"What in the Hell is going on?\\"<br /><br />As with all of the WCW tapes from this time period, the matches are edited down.  While many of the memorable moments are intact (such as Randy Savage's flying elbow from the top of the cage), we miss out on some of the theatrics that were a big part of Halloween Havoc.  For example there was a strange segment where druids or something came in during the 1991 PPV that is missing here.  There are enough good moments to keep your interest, but if you remember the matches when they aired, you may be disappointed in the chopping.<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '89<br />Cage Match<br />The Great Muta and Terry Funk vs. Sting and Ric Flair<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '90<br />Tag Team Title Match<br />Nasty Boys vs. Steiner Brothers<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '90<br />Heavyweight Title Match<br />Sid Vicious vs. Sting<br />(interference from another Sting)<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '91<br />\\"Chamber of Horrors\\"<br />Vader, Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack and Diamond Studd (Scott Hall)<br />vs. Sting, El Gigante and the Steiner Brothers<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '92<br />\\"Coal Miner's Glove Match\\"<br />Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts vs. Sting<br />(interference from Cactus Jack)<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '93<br />Heavyweight Title Match<br />Ravishing Rick Rude vs. Ric Flair<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '94<br />Heavyweight Title Match<br />Ric Flair vs. Hulk Hogan<br />special referee: Mr.T<br />interference from Sherri and \\"the Masked Man\\"<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '95<br />Monster Truck Match<br />Giant vs. Hulk Hogan<br />interference from Lex Luger, Randy Savage, Kevin Sullivan, Jimmy Hart and \\"the Yeti\\"<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '96<br />Heavyweight Title Match<br />Hollywood Hogan vs. Macho Man Randy Savage<br />interference from The Giant<br /><br />Halloween Havoc '97<br />Cage Match<br />Hollywood Hogan vs. Rowdy Roddy Piper<br />interference by Randy Savage<br /><br />There are some things missing from this tape, namely the great Havoc promos.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a Great mini-series movie, but it is all worth the time to watch it all! I found myself glued to the Television and loved the Whole movie! I Like how Christian Virtues in this Movie. Helping People with God is Right!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I bought this because my girls kept watching the movie on satelite but not alwyas catching the whole thing.  They love it.  And I love singing along to the songs - which they don't love.
B000I5YCCO|3.0|I find Taylor has a lovely voice and I like the acoustic stuff on her album a lot.  I just think being a 40 something male, I may not have been the intended audience.  Every song is some kind of boy/girl story as if the songs were written from pages of her diary.  This being her first album and having at least two singles, she should be proud.  But I felt the album could have been stronger overall.  Maybe whoever packaged her was searching with this album, maybe there was pressure on her to sound like every other Pop Country dribble coming from Nashville these days.  If they want Taylor to succeed give her the acoustic guitar and let her sing, take note from the songs that became singles.  This girl has talent don't bury it under a bunch of cliche Nashville assembly line canned production template.
1596590688|4.0|Overall this is a fantastic title but condensed it is not. The authors could have written it in half as many pages without losing any useful information. In terms of content its a solid 8 our of 10.
1860498833|4.0|I chipped away at the first half of this book for about three weeks, reading bits at a time but not being drawn into it as a \\"page turner\\".  It just didn't grab me initially.  Finally, with a chunk of dedicated \\"read time\\" during an 18 hour flight, I knocked out the second half of the book.  I was very glad to have stuck with and finished the book as it ended up being a story very much worth reading.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful and I learned early on that I shouldn't judge a character too early because what they may appear to be will likely drastically change with the developing plot.  Not surprising if one stops to think about what these characters are, namely sheisters, thieves, less-than-reputable citizens and a few with somewhat odd perversions.<br /><br />In the end, the elements of consiparcy, double-crossing, love, eroticism, deceit, mystery and tragedy combine to make a very good read.  And Ms. Waters' excellent presentation style is an added bonus.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I have just finished seeing High School Musical 2 which premiered on the UK Disney Channel on Friday for the fifth time (I watched it on Saturday afternoon with my nephew and two nieces and they loved it). It is great and I say just as good as the original High School Musical.    Basically Troy (Zac Efron) and the gang are back but this time it is Summer vacation and they all get jobs at a sports club over the summer.     The songs are outstanding just like High School Musical soundtrack. Best songs are What Time Is It, You Are The Music In Me and All For One.     The DVD is released in December just in time for Christmas.     I am sure it will be on many children's and adults Christmas lists. It will certainly be in my DVD collection and I am 42 years old. It reminds me of my favourite film when I was only 12 years old, Grease.    Brilliant film. Add it to your collection, you won't be sorry.     All I can say is I can't wait for High School Musical 3, filming starts in January 2008 and will be on at the cinema first.

B000VZBCWE|5.0|I was in London last night with my partner and saw (quite unexpectedly) that the Empire Leicester Square were showing a Digital Presentation of this concert...I saw it and I have to say, the picture and sound for this \\"re-release\\" is nothing short of awesome.      Having already seen many far older films and concerts being transferred to high definition, This version ranks among the best I've seen, with perfect colour reproduction and image resolution. The source is meticulously free of dirt and scratches and doesn't suffer from artificial removal of natural grain on the 35mm stock, preserving the concert's filmic look.     Tim Young at Metropolis Studios is on top form and has really outdone himself with the sound mix...It's quite front heavy which is the way I like it with the surrounds only adding to the illusion of actually being at the concert.  The bass is deep, fast, clean and tight (and any other words you'd like to describe good bass) and had that real \\"kick in the chest\\" gravitas.    The Empire has long been my favourite cinema for picture and sound, so I was surprised when, at one point during the concert, the sub bass distorted rather alarmingly.  In their defence, the bass on that particular section was insane, but if Empire want to reclaim their \\"most spectacular cinema in the world\\" title, they need to update their sound system to PMC speakers and Bryston amplification, as used by Metropolis and Brian May himself.    I'm expecting great things from this one...and the fact it's coming out on Blu-ray with (hopefully) a HD sound mix means we probably won't see it 're-released' for a good few years to come.     On a side note, the inclusion of the Live Aid tracks is fantastic news for me as it's my favourite Queen performance...followed closely by this one.
B000QXDED6|5.0|This is a great story yet a bit graphic. Really loved this movie and a great addition for collectors.

B00003CXC7|3.0|This film does a good job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere by making the audience the voyeur, however it was a little ridiculous at times.  Anyone saying anything negative about a Hitchcock film is sure raise a few eyebrows because some people seem to feel everything he churned out was remarkable.  This film was less than remarkable and if it didn't have the Hitchcock name on it, it would probably be rated lower.    Most of the problems that I had with Rear Window had nothing to do with Hitchcock though.  In fact, I would say that the concept was better than the screenplay and, if anything, Hitchcock did a good job at making a fairly weak screenplay into a watchable movie.    POSSIBLE SPOILER    Most of the character's behavior was absurd at best.  Maybe there were time/money constraints which prohibited a plausible ending but whatever the reason, the ending was ridiculous.  If Jimmy Stewart knew that the suspected murderer Raymond Burr saw him, why would he tell the Nurse to go bail out Grace Kelly and leave him alone in a wheel chair?  Why would he answer a phone (without knowing who's on the other end) and immediately start talking about the murderer?  Because he thought it was his friend that he just got off of the phone with?  Stupid.  Obviously, people can be that stupid in real life but I guess I just expected more than that from this film.  I also found Raymond Burr's desire to throw Jimmy Stewart out of the window retarded.  Let's see, someone has \\"evidence\\" that I committed a murder so why don't I give them absolute evidence by throwing a man out of a window while the police are right outside.  This made no sense whatsoever.    Direction = A-  Cinematography = A  Screenplay = C-  Overall Acting = B  Music Score = D    Overall a decent movie but hardly the classic that many seem to think it is.
0345494997|5.0|Hands down, this is the best work of fiction I have read in a long time. It's intelligent, articulate, historically accurate, sentimental, and elegantly written. Loving Frank is a portrait of Mamah Borthwick Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright. Mamah began as a client of Wright's and eventually became his muse. Loving Frank is the story of what lay between: betrayal of two families in the name of true love; the rise of the Modernist movement in Germany and Europe; how the Modernist movement affected Mamah and Frank; and, in turn how that shaped his vision and affected his craft for the rest of his career.
B000R4SMD6|5.0|It has been a while since hollywood has come out with a decent thriller/drama. It is not for the whole family. The acting could have been a bit better. I didn't figure out the ending until the end!<br /><br />One man's determined to get away with murder but another is determined to make sure he doesn't!!

B000002LCX|5.0|It is now twenty years since its release. I purchased the CD to replace a cassette tape, yes some of them can linger around that long and still wind around. Still just as wonderful, lyrics still stand \\"Paint a Vulgar Picture\\" & \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" true and funny as ever.
0143038419|5.0|I can't praise this book enough.  If you are a soul-searcher, or a traveller, or both, you will enjoy this true story of a 30-something woman's  journey through Italy, India, and Indonesia (in that order) as she tries to heal from some self-defeating decisions and relationships in her past.  Liz is easy to empathize with.  I particularly recommend the audiobook, also read aloud by the author, which I used to accompany me on my daily commute.    This is a wonderful way to explore the world and ourselves.  Enjoy!
074356619X|4.0|I liked this cd, it's good to listen to especially if your not feeling very up about life, its alot of what I have heard before but still a great listen.
B000683VI4|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this!  The onscreen chemistry is so obvious that it won't surprise you to learn that they are together offscreen ([...])    This is a must see film for anyone who likes romantic movies!
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is one of those movies that you have to see to understand it. Box office reviews and web commentaries barely touch on its amazing genius. The film has a largely visual storyline, so that makes it hard for people who don't process visual information very well or aren't sight-sensitive. Much is information communicated over these subtle details. Thus, those of us who are used to thinking analytically when watching films will know how to appreciate it, while those who simply want to rent this video and watch over popcorn will certainly feel disappointed.    I don't want to reveal too much of the storyline, but I will say that a core theme of the film is exploring what lurks behind the sugary image of middle-class, white suburbia and how appearances often contradict reality in astonishing ways. As someone who trained in philosophy while in undergrad, I would say that the film certainly has a steady nihilistic undercurrent that comes with post-modern existentialist themes. It's depressing, but depressing in a way that makes you come alive. It speaks the bitter truth by telling us each of the characters' lies. Even the title of the film evokes a sort of sweet, twisted irony.    Those who have longed for the 'Leave it to Beaver' or 'Father Knows Best' type of life will find this film revolting, but those who identify with 'The Simpsons' as being closer to reality will give it two thumbs up. American Beauty will definitely strike a sharp chord in a large audience, but I still say that only film buffs and those used to abstract-thinking will enjoy it. To those who simply want a shifty, action-filled plot, the movie might at first (unfairly) seem a bit boring.
B00005JPRD|5.0|I'd have to knock a half a star off a perfect five. If the marvelous momentum of first half of Julie Taymor's ambitious vision of Across the Universe was able to be carried throughout the second half this would have been inequitably one of the five greatest musicals ever. As it is it easily ranks in the top 100.<br /><br />The era that saw the British Invasion, the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement and America's involvement in the Viet Nam War is stylized as a backdrop for a trans-Atlantic love affair between a Liverpool war child, Jude and American teen-queen, Lucy.<br /><br />Taymor's seamlessly inserts Beatle standards with amazing effectiveness in the first half but as the film goes along the songs seem to lose some of their pertinence to the story, making the second half drag a bit. The songs for the most part are so well performed and realized that songs you've heard a thousand times, if you're my age, are given new insight. That is something I might have not thought possible, at least not to the degree Taymor and those involved have achieved. Revisited tunes like A Girl or I've Just Seen a Face and All My Loving have added meaning and heighten angst.<br /><br />The choreography, again mostly in the first half, is joyous and wonderfully inventive, among the best ever. The Induction Center/I Want You sequence was my favorite and the frat/With a Little Help from My Friends sequence was also terrific.<br /><br />The visuals are exceptional, especially during the For the Benefit of Mr. Kite segment and my favorite graphics, on the bus with Dr. Robert. Unfortunately, the song Dr. Robert was not used, probably due to its lack of recognition and instead opting for I Am the Walrus. All the  acid trip imagery is the best seen since 200 Motels, this of course is to be expected with Taymor at the helm. Whomever is technically responsible for these graphics will most likely garner an Oscar.<br /><br />The cast and cameos are perfect. The principles, Sturgess and Wood, are sublime and their singing is exquisite. I can't image there could be a better pair for their roles. It's the best musical pairing since MacRae and Jones.<br /><br />I think a certain amount of credit should be given to Moulin Rogue for breaking much of the ground that Taymor treads here.<br /><br />All in all Julie Taymor has made a new benchmark in her impressive career that includes a Tony for her direction of Broadway's The Lion King and her shocking feature film directorial debut of Titus. Across the Universe is visually arresting, sonically uplifting and, for those of you like myself who didn't care for Grease or Chicago, gives us hope that the musical is not as dead as once thought.
B000SONYRY|5.0|Satisfied w/product.  Shipping was more than I'd expected.  However, with gas prices, this was a deal.  I wouldn't hesitate to place another order.[[ASIN:B000SONYRY SONY Batteries CR2032 3 Volt Lithium 2032 Coin Battery]]
B00005JNBQ|5.0|As an adult over 60 I was not sure if I wanted to see this or not, but it was highly recommended by younger friends, and caught my attention at the beginning. Not only was it \\"retro\\" but it had meaning of life throughout - everyone wants to be needed, respected, safe and loved. At first I was not sure what all the \\"cheese\\" and milk and cows had to do with the story, but it becomes clear later on the meaning. All the \\"Steak Action\\" is with Uncle Rico and always associated with unpleasantness. Cheese somehow signifies happiness in this film.<br /><br />The story is about the title character, Napoleon Dynamite, who lives in a small rural town with his grandmother and 32 year old shy bachelor brother. Napoleon is a high school student that most of his peers consider weird. His brother is in his 30's and lives in on-line chatrooms. The grandmother taking care of Napoleon and his brother is injured in a dune buggy accident and sends Uncle Rico to take care of Napoleon and his brother.<br /><br />Napoleon's Uncle Rico is another quirky character their caregiver and \\"flim-flam\\" man. Always with different schemes to make a buck. Napoleon finally starts to look at life a bit differently when he befriends a new student,Pedro. Pedro is satisfied with his life and comfortable in his own skin. He is not afraid to take chances, ask girls to dances, and run for class president.<br /><br />This is definitely a movie aimed at teenagers, but I got a lot of laughs and meaning out of it. The ending is very touching and sweet. This is the type of a movie you can watch several times and take away something new.
1853261580|4.0|This is a wonderful story and a great book I was able to share with my students.  The only drawback with the book is that the pages are not in color, but the extremely low price allowed me to purchase the books for my students out of my own pocket.
0316067598|5.0|This was an amazing story we are lucky to be able to read. All the men and women of the armed forces deserve thanks but the Navy Seals we get to learn about in this book are my heros. The only negative I have is the \\"F\\" word being so prominent. I understand it's what was said but I would love to recommend this book to my son and the language keeps me from doing that. It's a shame too because I was moved to tears. Thank you for your service Marcus.
1600240682|2.0|The Lovely Bones is the story of a 14-year-old girl from suburban Pennsylvania who is murdered by her neighbor. She tells the story from Heaven, showing the lives of the people around her and how they have changed all while attempting to get someone to find her lost body<br /><br />In the audio narrative hands of the author Alice Sebold, this audio production is slow and sluggish. Yes, the novel does end . . . but after disk five, the listener will get a \\"who cares\\" attitude. I will say this, I enjoyed reading Ms Sebold's novel. It has heart and spirit. I wish that would have transferred that way to the audio medium. To say Ms Sebold's oration  is boring  is an understatement to the facts.<br /><br />Well we can hope this presentation will be re-recorded next year in time for the film adaptation of Bones, directed by Lord of The Rings Peter Jackson. May I suggest actor Stanley Tucci, who is part of the film cast and a wonderful narrator to boot, may be a good choice if Hachette audio is smart enough to redo this wonderful novel in audio.<br /><br />I cannot say this production in its current narrative form is worth any time to listen. This is one time I suggest read the book, it's better!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B000OPOANE|4.0|I've already reviewed the music on the CD page, so this concerns the DVD release only.<br />It's a good idea, and fun.  I quite enjoyed the extras and the artwork looks great (I wish there had been at least one 1920x1200 wallpaper, however).  It's possible to get places in the menus where you can't back out, however, requiring you to shut down the program and restart it.<br />Some have complained about the annoying registration involved to access most of the computer functions, and I agree.  Other than as a way to build a mailing list, it seems pointless to me.  Fortunately you can type in any data you want and use a disposable email address for registration.<br />My major complaint is in accessing the high resolution DVD-A tracks.  They're supposed to be on here, somewhere, but I have not been able to access them.  The menu doesn't give you an option for them, and on my computer, my home theater system, and my audio system, playing the disk in stereo simply gives you a downmixed version of the Dolby Surround mix.<br />If anyone knows how to get the 24bit hi-res stereo tracks to play, please let me know!
0061254592|5.0|Neil Gaiman, the author of the novel  Stardust (which was made into a great film with Robert De Niro and Claire Danes) and the Sandman stories /graphic novels from DC Comics, is a natural storyteller. He is also a  noted children author with a special talent to talk to children and adults with the sense of wonder of a child. He also has a children's audio collection of his picture books.<br /><br />Now to this current audio collection, these are sort of stories you would hear when you were ten and  around a summer campfire. The narrative talent of Gaiman draws the listener in and keeps you in. You don't care if these tales are  for children, young adults or adults, he makes all these PG type stories great.<br /><br />What makes this collection great is good storytelling. Like Ray Bradbury's S is for Space, which he notes in his audio forward, Gaiman uses simple ideas and meshes them into mini horror or thriller tales . . . and keeps you interested!<br /><br />It is worth your time to get this collection for your family. When you do, get one for the adults and one for the kids
0062515675|2.0|This is terrible writing, at its best, marketed to the masses.  The dialogue is so unreal.  The characters, you can't even relate to them.  It's so hokey, and nothing original. Unrealistic practices, rose meditation, c'mon, I'm to do this for two weeks.  There are many, many other better books out there.  Trying Being Peace by TNH.

1433203316|4.0|I Am Legend is coming to movie theaters on December 14th, 2007, starring Will Smith. So before the movie comes out, you should really listen to the talented Robertson Dean narrating this novella. Legend is about the last man on earth and his life. You see everyone else has  become a vampire-like being. Dean brings this novella of Richard Matheson alive.<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with  Matheson's work, he wrote the novels The Incredible Shrinking Man and  Bid Time Return (which became the film Somewhere in Time) and many short stories. He also scripted many episodes of the Classic TV show The Twilight Zone and such films as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and many of Roger Corman's horror films (The Raven (1963), The Comedy of Terrors (1964),  The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The House of Usher (1960)).<br /><br />This fearful audio volume is chock-full of horror stories as well as Legend. Matheson wrote horror long before Stephen King and Clive Barker. The stories written more than 50 years ago, however they seem as good as if they were written today. Matheson prayed on your fears and the human condition and still had you interested. It is that way on audio as well<br /><br />Dean and noted audio actor/director Yuri Rasovsky  take turns narrating stories in the volume. They do an amazing job, but some audio tales in this collection are hit and miss. Some lack the audio punch that it deserves<br /><br />Note  Blackstone audio always does the best unabridged audio work in the country these days. This anthology collection, even with all its flaws, is better than some of the other anthologies I have heard this year<br /><br />Go take a bite outta of the legend and get this<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
0385335997|5.0|Although this was not my favorite of the first three Outlander books, that's kind of like me saying I prefer Lindt chocolate over Godiva chocolate -- they're all yummy!<br /><br />\\"Voyager\\" was a little hard for me to wrap my mind around at first, as it took me a while to get used to a 20-years-older Jamie, but that hurdle was quickly passed as I got caught up in the book with it's interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />This series is one of my all-time favorites!
0440241901|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, so you must imagine how scared I was when I saw the size of the book. I started reading and I could not put this book down. I read it in less than a day and when I finished I couldn't stop thinking about the book and its great ending.  It's about a woman named Emma that goes on a business trip to Glasgow and on her way back she meets a man on the airplane to whom she tells all her secrets to when there's a lot of turbulence on the plane and she believes he'll be the last person she'll ever see. She thinks that she'll never see this man again, luckily, but to her surprise it turns out to be her boss.  I laughed out loud and I felt her anxiety when she was nervous. The book has great imagery and I can assure you won't be wasting your time reading it.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|What happens when you are confused because you, or your partner, doesn't know if he/she loves you? And, to top it all off, this occurs during the emotionally-charged time of Christmas?<br /><br />Amanda of Los Angeles punches her boyfriend in the nose for cheating on her, and breaks up with him. Meanwhile, in London, Iris is struggling with her affections for a co-worker. He has been toying with her for some three years. He acts as though he is interested in her one moment, but then has no qualms about openly seeing another woman. At one point, he is engaged to a woman--right in front of Iris. However often this happens, Iris just can't forget him. She loves him and wishes that he would unambiguously show love for her.<br /><br />The two hurt, confused women meet each other in the internet, and agree to live in each other's homes for two weeks in order to sort things out. Amanda goes to London, struggling in the snow of Christmastime. Iris goes to sunny California.<br /><br />Iris meets a man who diagnoses the situation facing Iris. He points out that it is natural to see a positive response from the other person as love and then to forget or deny the evidences of lack of love from that person. He himself catches his girlfriend with another man, and then faces her pleadings to forgive him and take her back. Will he? Or will something develop between himself and Iris?<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in London, Amanda runs into a man who pushes all her buttons. He seems so charming. But she is shocked to learn that he has two daughters. He then sheds his secretive self and notes that he is a widower and mother/father. What will happen then? How will they deal with the geographic distance separating them?
006054094X|5.0|I found the book fascinating and easy to read.  While the claims made by the author are stunning, he presents a plausible case for their authenticity.  If true, the thesis of 1421 turns history upside down.  If even partly true, the book sheds light on a part of history often ignored by American schools, 15th century China.  I personally find it hard to digest all the claims made by Menzies, however, some of the evidence is tremendously compelling.  As a history teacher I will be reading other articles and books related to this topic to gain a more comprehensive view from all sides of the issue.

B00003CXBK|5.0|As a person who usually does not watch animated movies, I caught the end of this film on a tv channel, was entranced, and then bought the video. The animation itself is wonderful. There is real artistic quality to the backgrounds, and the color is great. The sound track is also excellent. It is really engaging to hear the sounds of chopsticks clicking in bowls as the contents are slurped    The story line is complicated enough for adults to be interested in seeing what comes next. There is also a philosophic context which attracts attention. All in all this is a really worthwhile film that adults can watch with interest and enjoyment, and then even come back for more viewings.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a great trilogy.  Great movies in the old school style 3 hr long movies.  These are very good long movies, not like the ones we usually get now where they use scenes that aren't need in the movies just to make them longer.    Great drama, not much gore, excellent story line.

Same sex couples are normal and fine, and though I have a heterosexual lifestyle, the bigotry and hate from so called Christian's, makes me sick.  Jesus would have been ashamed of you.  Love is a blessing, wherever one finds it.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Good re-release. The extras are the only real difference from the original. The surfing and adrenaline extras where particularly good. I would have like to see more on the skydiving personally. I have met a few of the people that worked on that film,Tom Sanders in particular and it would have been nice to see more on there side of the movie.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that \\"if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there.\\" Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, \\" Black Manba\\" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake\\" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Patton<br />George C. Scott & Karl Malden<br /><br />Patton was a unique individual--he was not controlled by politically correct thought or language. He was a brilliant general feared by the Nazis. After WW II, he wanted to go to war with Russia while America's armies were still in Europe after WWII. He called them mongrels and predicted that they would be the next threat. No one listened to him. He got into trouble for speaking his mind, and after he died, the Cold War set in leading to Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, etc.  Watch this movie and learn that not all things can be solved with politically correct thought, speech and loving thy neighbor when your neighbor does not deserve to be loved. This movie won eight Academy Awards. I also recommend the sequel, The Last Days of Patton with George C. Scott. Read my review of that movie. George C. Scott did a masterful job of bringing this bigger than life individual to the screen.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|No doubt a polished album, the production is on point and the beats are dope. Kanye continues to run the line between street cred and the mass appeal.      Kanyes personality shines through on this one -he sticks to his style, and hasn't tried to take on a different persona which several rappers tend to do-- quite honestly he doesnt need too, the man is larger than life. The overall feel is an upbeat positive one which is consistent with the graduation theme.     Lyrically I was a little disappointed after his previous efforts.It just seems like Kanye ain't trying that much on this one. Not as clever as his previous works but all in all Kanye is still keeping it fresh, and this album is worthy to add to your collection.    'Graduation' will outsell 50's 'Curtis'!

B00003CX9E|5.0|And so we come to this, the pinacle of American film making. Often cited as one of the greatest films in movie history, and one that I saw for the first time only about three years ago. Does it live up to the hype?    God, yes.    Much is made, and rightly so, about the technical inovations in this movie. There are many and they are notable. The use of zooms before zoom lenses, the use of deep-focus, the appearance of ceilings, Greg Tolland's wonderful cinematography, etc, etc, ad naseum.    What really made this movie great for me are the performances and the story. Consider: Welles, who was young when this movie was made, convincingly manages to portray Kane at all the major stages of his life. Part of this was the makeup, but only part. Most of it was due to his incredible and forceful acting ability. Supporting performances by the likes of Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead (in the days before \\"Bewitched\\"), round out a superb cast.    Beyond that there's the screenplay. Sharp, biting and well-written with a good ear for dialogue (not surprising, given Welles' background in radio). At time the story is laugh-out-loud funny, and at other times filled with great pathos. Yeah, there's flaws (starting with the fact that no one appeared to be in the room to hear Kane's last word), but who cares? Mostly what it is, is amazing cinema.    Yes, the iconic images help. When I watched this movie the first time, it was like I was seeing it again. I'd seen so many referrences to the film, particularly in \\"The Simpsons\\" that it all gave me an odd sense of deja vu. This is not a bad thing.    The DVD presentation is great! Wonderful, insightful commentaries and \\"The Battle Over 'Citizen Kane'\\" (which is worth the DVD price in of itself), round out an excellent DVD.    A word to people who haven't seen the film before, or who have but weren't duly impressed: When I watched this movie the first time, I could sense the greatness. I could tell it was an amazing film, but I couldn'tquite figure out why. Then I played it with Roger Ebert's commentary track, and it all became clear. I HIGHLY recommend that anyone who watches this DVD do the same. The man has been known to do shot-by-shot presentations on this film, so he knows what he's about.    What's the last word of this review going to be? Rosebud!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye is back and as spectacular as ever!! I would not consider myself a Kanye West fan in particular, but he has gained my respect as an artist after putting out this stellar cd. Some tracks to check out are:          Track 3- Stronger: The smash-hit debut single sets the tone for the whole CD. It flows, it's catchy, and it's a unique spin on hip-hop.      Track 9- Flashing Lights: Awesome single that has on a techno-like beat, combined with Kanye's smooth lyrics. The song is flat-out stylish.       Track 5- Good Life: Great feel-good, upbeat single that will probably be Kanye's second single off the CD. T-Pain is EXCELLENT on this track.       Track 2- Champion: This track has classic Kanye style. Another great hit.
B000SO7OMA|4.0|Great music at a bargain price. Ms McKennitt has a beautiful voice and the numbers are terrific.
B00099BPP6|5.0|For me too, this was my very first opera recording way back in 1964 and it has remained one of my favourite versions of RIgoletto ever since. The is above all an opera with beautiful singing. Bergonzi! What an artist! Utterly bewitching, in a suave aristocratic manner, not in your testosterone rich macho style often favoured by singers who try this part. Fischer Dieskau is totally convincing in the jester's role. Again, the beauty of tone, the effortless legato and the feeling for the words are without peer. True, his was not an Italianate sound, like Gobbi's or Bruson's, but his singing is utterly convincing.     Renata Scotto is a singer who was so brilliant on stage that her recordings did not get the recognition they deserve. Hers is quite a juicy voice, not entire virginal as you might expect in this part but she sings magnificently throughout, nowhere better that in the glorious second act duet with Fischer Diskau which, for me, is the highlight of this recording. Kubelik, a vastly underestimated operatic conductor, makes here his one and only commercial recording of Italian Opera. Totally compelling.

Hes Kanye West Not Jay Not Nas Not Common Never be tribe or dela or Bran nub thats a diffrent cd if you compare him to them than your gonna be comparing apples to oranges and sound stupid.  Hes on some other stuff most people know nothing about because they dont really know that much about music =/ they just know hip hop.  Its like if your favorite producer wanted to rap over his beats..thats what its like.

1932100660|2.0|When I began reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  In the first section, when Dr. Campbell described his own experiments on the effect of milk protein on liver cancer in rats, I just poured through page after page, thinking, \\"What great science\\"!    At that point in the book he reported his experiments, their rather dramatic results, was careful to point out the limitations and did not extrapolate.  So far, very good.    In the next section he describes the China Study itself.  There is also an addendum at the back, which gives more detail about the structure of the study.  The foundation for the study was a database collected by the Chinese government during the 1970's.  It listed the age and causes of death in each of China's provinces over a certain time period.  For the follow-up study ten years later, they chose 67 rural villages and gathered data on details about diet, several markers from blood samples and other factors, on approximately 6000 individuals.  He claims to have data on about 350 variables. However, only 57 of the 417 pages in the book are devoted to discussion of The China Study.    The purpose of the study was to try to relate diet and other factors, with the diseases that caused death, especially cancers.  His particular interest was about the effect of a purely vegetarian diet. It bothered me that he had undertaken leadership of that follow-up study, with a pre-conceived notion of what he wanted it to show.    At this point in the book, Dr. Campbell began to make very broad statements about the Chinese diet and the benefits of a diet that was devoid of animal protein.  This is where I really began to have trouble, because I felt that either the study itself or his description of it fell short of supporting the broad claims he was making.    There's no discussion of things like smoking, environmental pollution and sanitation, all of which plague China.... Even rural China.    Another thing that bothered me was his description of the Chinese diet.  It flies in the face of my own observations and experiences during many trips to China and other parts of Asia, over the course of about 35 years.    Meat and seafood are a major staple of the Asian diet.  They eat quite a bit of pork, chicken, duck, pigeons, fish, eggs and even snakes, organs and sea creatures that Americans would not eat.  They do eat much less animal protein than Americans and always accompany it with lots of rice and vegetables.  In that sense, their diet is much better than ours.  But it is not vegetarian.  Although much of their food is stir-fried in a wok, it is done with vegetable oils.  Until very recently, junk food has not been available and it is rare to find beef.  So it is a much better-balanced diet than ours.    In years past, during trips to Taiwan, I've been to markets where live chickens & ducks were laid on the ground with their feet tied together.  People would either buy them live, or have the merchant slaughter & clean them before their eyes.  In one market I saw a vendor selling the blood from snakes he had killed & drained as the people watched.  Next day, my hosts took me to a snake-meat restaurant for lunch!  (Not much meat & lots of  bones.)  In back alleys of Taipei, I saw families raising pigeons for food.    Just last year at a Shanghai food market in a very old and traditional neighborhood, the emphasis was on meat and fish.  There was a section that sold vegetables & rice, but around the fringes of the central meat market. The displays were open and there was no refrigeration!    As the book proceeded through other chapters, making incessant claims about the preventative and curative effects of an all-vegetable diet, he begins to sound like a 19th century \\"Snake oil\\" merchant.     He's a zealot on a soap box.  Mind you, HE MAY BE RIGHT.  Most of what he says about nutrition has been heard before and is considered by many, to be the Holy Grail of diet.  There is certainly a lot of public opinion that red meat, animal fat and highly refined carbs are bad for you.  But after the first section, I felt that his science became lost in his rhetoric.    Throughout the early parts of the book, I began to wonder what the meat and dairy industries had to say about all this.  He certainly got into that in excruciating detail.  Again, to the extreme where unfortunately, he sounded like all the folks at the fringes who claim that \\"Big business\\" and \\"Government\\" are trying to discredit them.  I kept thinking of all the stories of big oil companies buying the patents for a \\"90 mile per gallon\\" carburetor, to keep it off the market.  (On the other hand, there's Galileo.)    After finishing the book, I went to the Internet to look for critiques.  There are plenty!  Most are by vegetarians and vegetarian societies, all were having orgasms over the book.  Finally I did find a site with some criticisms.  Now I'd better mention that this site belongs to an organization that advocates increased consumption of fats and oils.  However, the critique of the book was limited to a few specific items and did seem to be based on good science.    I do have some experience with statistical methods of extracting the effect of individual variables from data involving many variables and felt a bit uneasy about the analysis methods while reading Campbell's chapters about the study.  This critique pointed out that with 350 variables and just 67 samples, there are not enough samples to establish high (95%) levels of statistical confidence.  The best that data structure could accomplish is an \\"Indication,\\" but not proof.     Actually, Campbell himself does discuss the limitations of statistical methods.  His problem is that as the book progresses, he wanders away from \\"probability\\" and speaks with \\"certainty\\" about too many diverse subjects.    The critic, who had apparently examined the actual 900 page Study report, also claimed that Campbell had ignored data that was counter to his theories and in some cases showed negative results of a vegetarian diet.  (That does happen when dealing with probabilities.)  He then went on to question the reliability of some of the blood markers that were used.  (That part was far beyond any of my knowledge.)  Also, the fact that the blood samples of each village were pooled, did enable more markers to be measured, but all data about the variability among individuals was lost.    Another thing that bothered me was that Campbell completely ignored the fact that anthropologists tell us that hominids have been eating meat for about 2.5 million years, apparently with great success.   Also, if meat is so harmful, why and how do carnivorous animals thrive?    He tells that cow's milk can cause type-1 diabetes in babies, but that mother's milk is ok.  He leaves a gaping hole in his discussion because he doesn't explain the differences between those two types of milk.      So, what is my bottom line on this book?  It is widely accepted that vegetables, especially fresh vegetables, are good for you. No argument there.  His early research clearly indicates that there is a threshold, above which animal protein can do some harm.  That is intuitively appealing.  We Americans do eat much too much meat.  But, given the extremely long omnivorous history of mankind, it would seem that a moderate amount of animal protein is an important dietary nutrient.    I feel that Campbell has raised many good points, but his zealotry has taken him too far from sound science.  That's too bad.  He's hurt his credibility.

0802714544|4.0|I'm not a seasoned connoisseur of spy fiction, but had the feeling nonetheless upon finishing this book that I was not likely to find many (if any) of its type that I liked as well.  The suspense was there, the 'never-certain-what's-what' quality was there,  the serpentine plot, etc.  But for me perhaps most impressive was the overall atmosphere that permeated the story.  I would say a 'dreary realism' -- but in a good sense!  The reader is authentically submerged into the gray, secret world of espionage.  Nothing glamorized or oversimplified.  If anything, it is a tad too morally ambiguous to my mind.  Others would disagree.  The title of the book fits the contents to perfection.    The story builds effectively, and its climax-conclusion comes off as fitting.  I enjoyed it, and found it seamlessly written, reflecting considerable knowledge on the part of the author of the shadowy existence about which he writes.    For me (I'm a hard grader) it didn't rise quite high enough to attain a 5-star rating, but it's a near-miss.  \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a slick and skillful novel that readers who like this sort of thing are apt to enjoy very much.

0156030306|5.0|If you are a true lover of literature, you probably have a handful of novels that will always be cherished for as long as you live.  For me, \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is such a book.  (I have read both the original 'novella' as well as the expanded novel, and like the novella the best.  Also, I eventually saw the movie \\"Charly\\", based on this story, and thought it was hugely inferior to the book).      I will never forget my beloved 7th grade ('76-'77) 'high-English' teacher, Mrs. Colette Heideman -- my favorite I ever had, I think.  Among the many terrific things she did was to assign this story for us to read.  It moved me deeply, and does to this day.  The story shows so powerfully how profoundly wrong it is to equate a human being's true worth simply to their IQ, and such like.  No, the essence of what makes a person worthy of dignity and decency is something much deeper.  (I believe it is derived from their being created in the image of God Himself).      Spoiler Warning.    The hardest I've ever cried while reading a story happened with this one.  At the end, as Charlie's intellect is deteriorating, he realizes what is happening.  In his journal he writes something like (I'm going from memory), \\"i dont know why im dum agen.  maybe I dint try hard enuff.\\"  When I read these words my insides collapsed in a gush of tears.  Fortunately I was alone in my room.      I use words like \\"brilliant\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" sparingly, but \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" truly merits such superlatives.  BTW, adding to this story's poignancy for me, dear Mrs. Heideman was killed in a car accident three years after I had her as my teacher.  I loved her and always remember her when I think of this story.

B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder hit yet another new high with Songs In The Key Of Life. We get seventeen tracks plus an awesome four bonus tracks. This two record album set with an EP 45rpm record has been carefully and lovingly transferred to a two CD set for us to enjoy.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today.\\" The gospel feel of this number makes this number stand out as a highlight of this album. Stevie uses this song to spread his message of peace and love NOW here on Earth. The melody uses the electric guitars, piano, bass and percussion to bolster the number; and the backup chorus enhances the song as well. \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" starts with the strings--and when Stevie comes in the number takes off like a jet! Stevie sings of the strife poor people everywhere must face; his voice doesn't convey any anger but the lyrics certainly send the bitter message that this strife is unacceptable. I hope \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" encourages more people to help those in need.<br /><br />\\"Sir Duke\\" sports that big band flavor mixed with a funky 1970s beat that proves too memorable and catchy for anyone to ever forget! Stevie's voice never sounded better; and this upbeat tribute to Duke Ellington and other black artists shines like gold. Great jamming from those musicians, too! \\"Sir Duke\\" is an obvious highlight of this two CD set; and so is the ballad entitled \\"I Wish.\\" \\"I Wish\\" gets the royal treatment from Stevie as he sings this to perfection. Stevie remembers how much simpler life was when he was young--even though they were poor, he didn't know it because he was still a happy child.<br /><br />\\"Pastime Paradise\\" sports a great melody with awesome key changes; Stevie sings of how we need to work today to make a better future. This stunning ballad works well not just because of the lyrics but also because of the musical arrangement and the backup singers for Stevie. Great!<br /><br />The second CD continues this incredible track set. \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" tells about the joy Stevie experienced when one of his children was born. This moving ballad has a relentlessly upbeat set of lyrics with a melody that uses the harmonica, guitars and percussion well to enhance the beauty of \\"Isn't She Lovely.\\" I predict that you will like \\"Isn't She Lovely\\" very, very much.<br /><br />\\"Joy Inside My Tears\\" is another moving ballad about a man whose life has finally found some happiness now that he has his one true love; the piano and percussion work wonders for \\"Joy Inside My Tears.\\" \\"Black Man\\" is a lengthy but awesome ballad about how everyone from all races made life better for others--and therefore all races should continue to work together to make a better tomorrow. \\"Black Man\\" sports a very funky 1970s beat to it; but it still works well even today--love that musical arrangement!<br /><br />\\"As,\\" yet another Stevie Wonder masterpiece on this two CD set, has a wonderful arrangement with the perfect beat for this optimistic ballad about the importance of love. The backup chorus lacks nothing; and the guitars, percussion and piano bolster \\"As.\\" Stevie sings \\"As\\" passionately with all his heart and soul, too.<br /><br />One of the bonus tracks, \\"Saturn,\\" lets Stevie express his desire to move to another place--or world--where violence is gone, \\"people live to be two hundred and five,\\" and there is peace and harmony. An electric arrangement enhances \\"Saturn;\\" and Stevie sings this one without a superfluous note! \\"Ebony Eyes\\" has a great upbeat feel to it as Stevie celebrates the existence of a young woman whose natural beauty attracts Stevie. This funky 1970s love ballad works very well; and I love that backup chorus!<br /><br />The liner notes give us the lyrics to all the songs; and the incredible artwork is worth the price of admission alone! Stevie himself adds a brief commentary near the beginning of the liner notes booklet.<br /><br />Stevie Wonder, always the genius and the gentleman, remains an icon of the twentieth century for his fine music and his message of peace. Songs Of The Key Of Life gives us Stevie at his very best; and people who appreciate 1970s rock with a little R&B and soul mixed in are going to love this two CD set!<br /><br />Enjoy!s Stevie at his very best; and people who appreciate 1970s rock with a little R&B and soul mixed in are going to love this two CD set!    Enjoy!

0393316041|5.0|Mr. Feynman is a curious and great character indeed, he's the sort of guy that doesn't take your word for it, unless he's able to experimently verify it himself. Remember, this is the guy that, during the Challenger tragedy hearings, demonstrated the O-ring's inadequacy in-person by using ice-water. He's the kind of guy that believes in seeking the true nature about things, never afraid to ask questions, never too concerned with puppetry or distinguished titles. In short, he's the kind of guy that is an inexhaustible inspiration and guiding star for all of us that is facinated with what science can bring.    Now, the improbable outcome that this guy should end up as a Nobel Laureate, the most distinguished and honourable title of the science community at large, is of course the great irony of it all. This book tells you the background story of this and other improbable events. Be it real or surreal, they are always hilarious, sometimes as a result of Mr. Feynmans highly developed sense of humour, sometimes unintentionally so. The stories date back to young Feynman when he was only a kid, and are told with such warmth and good spirits, that they will make you both laugh and cry. And at the end, you be left with unique insights into a curious and truly facinating character indeed!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|It took me a few listens to actually get use to this album.  Firstly, it's very different from her previous albums, with more emotional depth and strength that it will take time to digest the raw passion from her vocals. Anyone who has been through a break-up can relate to her agonizing lyrics, and the pain is the clear link that threads all of her songs together.  It's quiet admirable for her to take such a large step outside of her proverbial pop soap-box. I'm completely amazed at the diversity she pulls through her various sounds.  She's not just any pop-princess, she has soul, and the control over her voice/words is a clear indicator of her growth.  After a few listens, you will be able to appreicate the care she has put into this album.

B00013RC8O|4.0|Vanishing Point is one of those cult classics that may have not been big in the mainstream box office, but is a huge hit with car buffs, especially 1970 Challenger/Barracuda fans.  The DVD also has an optional director's comments soundtrack which really makes for interesting viewing.    Vanishing Point is a 1971 period piece (I was 4 and 5 years old in 1971) that brings back some vague childhood memories of cars, hairstyles, clothing, etc.    Although the director acknowledges that 20th Century Fox started out wanting this to be an A feature that was eventually relegated to a B movie (he explains why in the director comments), there is a combination of quality cinematography, and cheesy moments in the film that leaves me somewhat perplexed.  I mean, why the hoaky overdubbed high speed car chase sounds that don't necessarily match what's being shown in some scenes and not in others?  The director also says that Barry Newman was not his first choice to play Kowalski, but that 20th Century Fox essentially forced him to.    In a car magazine interview, Barry Newman claimed that there were a total of 5 cars, all Alpine White 1970 Dodge Challengers, four of them with 440 Magnums with 4 speeds, one with a 383 automatic, used in the filming.  However in the director's comments, Richard Sarafian claimed that 9 cars were used.  So who's right?  Based on the footage, it doesn't surprise me that multiple cars (however many) were destroyed in the course of filming Vanishing Point.    Overall, Vanishing Point is a good value DVD for $13.00.  What with the American version, the British version (with one additional scene), the director's comments, and the trailers, it really makes for $13.00 worth of solid entertainment - if you're into car chase movies.    As with most DVDs of older fims, the picture and sound quality are a big improvement over the older blurry and grainy VHS version.  The DVD soundtrack is crystal clear and crisp rather than muddy and overly saturated on the VHStape.  Enjoy!

B00026WU7I|5.0|Bob Dylan has been playing music longer than many of his fans have been alive.   Including studio releases, live releases and collections, he has somewhere around 50 albums on the market, his most recent one being Modern Times.  Many of his songs are still associated with the anti-war sentiments of the Vietnam era.      The lyrics are his songs most notable quality, and he sings them with a voice of utter truth and sincerity.  The themes in his music cover social, political and philosophical ground, inspiring and relating to people from all walks of life.     Everything that makes Bob Dylan a legend is contained in Blood On the Tracks.  His artful storytelling of the American life during his era bleeds raw emotion on every track. Dylan is a pioneer in the folk music genre, and as he aged, he branched out further into the rock genre.  His lyrical genius, however, still exceeds that of many of his contemporaries.     Blood On the Tracks was released in 1975, which was during an era of political skepticism following events such as the Watergate scandal.  This album was Dylan's fifteenth studio album release, and by this time his style was beyond recognizable.  His style defined and influenced folk singers to come.  Considered one of his best by many, and always a reference for comparison of his later albums, Blood On the Tracks is an American classic.     Tracks like \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" will bring listeners to tears almost every time, while \\"Meet Me In the Morning's\\" seductive guitar riffs will entice everyone's inner lady.  The album also features the number one single \\"Tangled Up In Blue,\\" and is often labeled one of his best albums.      It is difficult to compare Dylan to other artists, because other artists are more commonly compared to him.  His voice is rough and real, and no one can touch an imitation.  There isn't much more a listener could demand of Dylan, although the ten tracks may not be enough.  On vinyl it's the perfect amount, but on an iPod, the listener will always be left wanting more.
0143038419|3.0|I gsve up just before she reached India (the Pray part).  But just as I was about to give the book away, I skimmed the last pages and found them rather sweet.  Didn't make me want to go back and read the middle, though.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is an excellent 2-disc set. The movie has been digitally restored, looking better than ever. The story of Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera is well-known by now; watching it after all these years has increased my appreciation of it. I highly recommend watching the Making-of documentaries first, as they will also enhance your viewing experience. Especially enlightening is the story of how Walt changed the Rudyard Kipling tale and why (and to learn that he actually returned to the original text for his inspiration of how to end his version). It is also somewhat sad to see that this was the last film to have Disney's indelible stamp on it due to his death, yet also inspiring to hear the animators talk about what they put into the film as well as future animators who were inspired as youngsters by viewing it. Different concepts along the way are interesting to see, and not surprising to learn that Phil Harris put much of his own personality into the dialogue and characterization of Baloo. The other extras are fun too, including the games (although some could benefit from better instructions, such as the follow Kaa's eyes game). Be sure to pick up this newest Disney Classic release - you won't be sorry!
B0002WZTPC|5.0|I love this movie. Watched it for the first time when I was a kid and have been in love with it since. The soundtrack is amazing as well.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|i saw this for the first time yesterday and i did not move until it was over! this is one of the best movies - period.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I tried, folks.  As much as I was in love with the first season of this show, I tried to be critical for the next season because we've seen it before--a superstellar show goes sour in the second act.<br /><br />But as I watched my DVDs with stern face in place, I realized that the creative juices are still pumping out this delicious and original blend of horror, humor, and backroad culture.  Why can't Hollywood make spooky this good?  Why are they leaving it up to a freakin' tv show to put a good, well-made story into under an hour?<br /><br />Well, I'm not complaining, because this continues to be a television gem.<br /><br />The season begins where the first left off--the Winchester family being pulled from the wrecked Impala in a season premeir that jumpstarts the season even more than the pilot did.  Thus proceeds the demon-hunting and other creepy horrors mixed in with a solemn view of life and death that manages to leave its emotional mark on each episode.<br /><br />It's a more emotional season than the first, and that is hardly a bad thing.  To me it shows a sense of storyline maturity, quite necessary after the first season set that wondrous exposition.  The brothers grow closer (no one can deny the incredible chemistry Jared and Jensen have), and themes are explored that show marvelous creativity and sensitivity.<br /><br />But don't worry, it's not becoming a silly drama.  It's still Sam and Dean Winchester, ready with wit and banter and a suave sexiness that still reminds you that television is supposed to be fun.  The show has a cool, wild, and sexy vibe that just screams rock-n-roll and a ride down an old country highway.<br /><br />On top of episodes of what is simply a great show, the DVD set comes with some kickin' extras, including: a good ol' fashioned gag reel, deleted scenes, commentaries, and a road map that gives a sense of culture and research to the boys' paranormal adventures.<br /><br />It's always fun to have a show that has a sense of style, chemistry, and the ability to maintain a main continuing plot as well as plenty of individual stories.  Thanks for another great season, and I'm looking forward to more!in continuing plot as well as plenty of individual stories.  Thanks for another great season, and I'm looking forward to more!
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The product arrived very fast, in 10 days, even though it said it would arrive about 15 days later.    About the product itself, I'm a big fan of the Matrix movies, so I was very happy with all the bonus DVD-s. The movies were great quality, both the picture and the sound.    All in all, I'm very pleased both with the delivery time, and, more importantly, the product itself. I definitely recommend it to all the Matrix fans, it's well worth the money.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|While I enjoyed his first cd (a few songs at least).  I was just looking for some improvement from the first.  He has done that this time around with \\"All The Lost Souls\\".  He has a different vibe to him on this release..that i didnt really feel on the first one (not that i didnt like it).  But Mr. Blunt seems to have a clearer purpose on this record and it involves getting us to listen and just enjoy the things that we have in life.  He does it with a voice that while not strong is more than clear and resonates on each and every song on the set.  While it only clocks in at 38 mins and 39 seconds.  It gets what needs to be said across with out all the interludes and crappy intros that other artists seem to pile on to their releases.<br /><br />Simply put its just a really good record to listen and mellow out too without getting too deep and trying to do too much.  \\"All The Lost Souls\\" helps you find that something that you may have lost or is right there in front of your eyes.  Nice one this time around, JB.
B00009NQQO|4.0|I got this toy for my son who is 2. For something so inexpensive, it seems well constructed. I'm impressed the suction cups stick so well to the tile of my bath enclosure; you really have to pull to remove them. I also like that the balls can double as squirters.<br /><br />So, all in all, a good little value toy for the bored bather.
B00005JO9J|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW! I recently got hooked on it when I was flipping through the channels and saw it on Lifetime. So, I had to get caught up before the 4th season started. Very good show.
0380789035|4.0|_American Gods_ is a road trip story of sorts, though one that visits places that are \\"behind the scenes\\" in this great country. It is also an epic quest, a story of destiny, prophecy, and a story of conflict between old and new. Also, much in the book is not as it appears.<br /><br /> The protagonist is a person by the name of Shadow, released from prison a few days before the completion of his sentence due to the death of his wife in a car accident. His best friend was unfortunately (for several reasons) was with his wife Laura, and as his friend had a job lined up for Shadow when he got out, our hero is at loose ends.<br /><br /> Or is he? On the plane ride home he encounters a strange older gentleman by the name of Wednesday. Knowing far more about Shadow than anyone could really know, he offers Shadow employment. Shadow tries to ditch him, getting off the plane at a layover and going across country in a rental car. Wednesday however finds him in an out of the way diner.<br /><br /> It seems Shadow cannot escape this Wednesday and his offer to be an assistant, so he accepts. Is also seems that Wednesday is a god. Odin to be specific, head of the Norse pantheon; though Shadow at first of course disbelieves this, it soon becomes clear that Shadow - and all of humanity - was unaware of what occurred behind the scenes in the mortal world.<br /><br /> Wednesday is not the only divinity living and working as a human (or sometimes animal) in the United States. Not only is the country a nation of immigrant mortals and the cultures they came from, but it is also a nation of immigrant gods and goddesses (and other beings) from every land and culture, including some very old cultures.<br /><br /> Wednesday gravely informs Shadow that a war is coming between the deities, one with the older, fading powers on one side - such as the Norse and Russian deities among many others - and the new, rising, American-grown powers on the other side. The beliefs, passions, and interests of people in the United States have unknowingly given rise to a new crop of arrogant, powerful, and rising gods of the internet, news media, automobiles, and credit cards, feeding off the power and unknowing sacrifices of millions of Americans. Apparently not content to become more powerful than the old gods, Wednesday says these new, American gods intend to hunt down and destroy the old deities.<br /><br /> What follows is a cross country trip by Wednesday and Shadow, trying to bring into the fold the scattered older gods, attempting to put up some united front against the much more powerful and better connected new gods. The two meet many interesting and vividly described characters along the way.<br /><br /> There are many good things about this novel. Even some of the most apparently minor secondary characters are well-drawn and vivid. Much of the quest took the two to small towns throughout the country (with Shadow hiding in one for an extended period of time) and Gaiman did a very good job of giving the feel of small town life to the reader. The book took place in winter and without overwhelming the reader Gaiman never let him or her forget the season either. The gloomy, snowy, wintry conditions really suited the storyline.<br /><br /> I liked the many gods, goddesses, and mythological monsters encountered by Shadow in his travels, some hiding in plain sight as normal humans and animals, others visible only by those who can see things behind the scenes. There were several vignettes, some quite good, early in the book describing how various deities and mythical beings made it over to this country, how the faerie of the British Isles or the gods of Africa for instance made it to these shores and thus remain in this country to this day, carried over by the actions of immigrants, residing in their hearts and minds. The variety of beings described is quite diverse and included some surprising inclusions.<br /><br /> The book had a great twist ending and much of thebook was not as it appeared, that I also liked.<br /><br /> Laura, for reasons apparent to the reader later in the book, becomes a surprisingly important character, she was interesting.<br /><br /> As for the bad, well, there were several very graphic sex scenes early on in the novel, including one that was quite bizarre, even horrific (not gory, but definitely of a supernatural nature). Wednesday disappears for large segments of the book, leaving Shadow to his own devices. Though what Shadow does during his employer's absences is quite interesting and ultimately largely relevant to the greater plot, it does give the reader a feeling that much is being missed at times as to the nature of events in the book.<br /><br /> All in all a very good modern fantasy story.sons apparent to the reader later in the book, becomes a surprisingly important character, she was interesting.

0765315246|5.0|I've been a science fiction fan since my teens, but haven't read a lot of new SF in the last ten years. Just not enough new ideas in what I'd read. Until now.    \\"Old Man's War\\" has new ideas every few pages, and what I appreciate is their plausability. This is a novel grounded in hard science and is a worthy successor (as many others have mentioned) to Joe Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\", Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\", and Orson Scott card's \\"Ender's Game\\". If you're familiar any of these novels, then \\"Old Man's War\\" will remind you of them, but the book is no warmed-over rehash of any of them. Trust me, \\"Old Man's War\\" is an original.    Scalzi has a knack for presenting his hard science without either slowing the story down or confusing the reader, and the novel's science is extrapolated from both up-to-date theory in quantum physics and the rapid pace of technology. And the characters have substance. They feel like people we know, or could know. You care about them. Scalzi also isn't afraid to tackle the ethical implications of the world he has create or the actions of those who inhabit it. Some may see it as a pro-war book, others as anti-war - I see it as a book that will make you think about the implications of war.    All of this in a rousing good yarn - had I started the book early enough in the day, I would have finished that same day. The finest accolade I can give this book is that I have already read it twice, and look forward to reading it again and again.    This is one of the most readable science fiction books in years. If you like SF, or would like to sample it, then I highly recommend \\"Old Man's War\\".
B000R7HY0K|1.0|There's little reason to wonder why this tanked so badly at the box-office.  Grindhouse movies did lousy business back in the 70's, so there's really no reason to expect that they'd do any better thirty years later.  \\"Death Proof\\" is the nadir of Tarantino's fixation with the 70's, and indeed, comes off as a parody of his own work.  Long, pointless, (and surprisingly boring) scenes of people sitting around talking lead up to two mediocre chase scenes.  If you liked the movie, then you already went to see it, so go ahead and buy the DvD.  If you haven't seen the movie, there's probably a reason, and there's nothing about the DvD that will suddenly make you a fan.
0385733577|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book this much in ages. If you are a mythology lover, quite a few of your old friends will be here. Packed with action, but well written to boot. I for one , am waiting anxiously for the next book in the series. Bravo Mr. Scott.
B000R8YC18|3.0|this is a great set BUT there is an edit to the film which, for the life of me, I cannot understand on any level.    The funny thing is I watched it with the Paul Schrader commentary and you'd think he'd notice lines of his own dialogue which were now missing.    Anyway, the scene where Travis takes Iris up to her room -- the guy who rents the room (also featured in Scorsese's Mean Streets) tells Travis something like to \\"leave your gun cowboy\\" and then when Travis and Iris leave and guy says he will be timing them, you can clearly see the gun in the guy's hand even though the earlier the dialogue was missing.    Then when Travis returns, the guy is carrying Travis' gun up to him to return it but you can barely see it this time -- shot seems shorter and I had to freeze-frame it to even see the gun this time -- and his line about it is gone and suddenly Travis gives him the $20 and says \\"this is for you...spend it well\\" or something.    I watched this scene a few times and even checked the script (also on the disc) and the scene, or rather the lines and bits of the scene, are gone despite being referenced in the script.    This is one of my favorite films of all time and I've seen it on its original release at the drive-in, edited on TV, on cable, and on videotape and am sure those lines were in the film.    Please could someone out there explain this for me?      Is this some kind of retro-tinkering like Lucas did with Star Wars and Spielberg did with E.T.?    I am completely baffled and a bit annoyed.  I hate films being tampered with, especially one of the best films ever made.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary was very informative, inspirational, and should be viewed by all of us living on Earth!  Al Gore presents the facts in a clear way using graphs, data, and anecdotes which makes this documentary somewhat engaging.  When my child is older, we'll be viewing it again so that the impact of the choices we make are clearly conveyed.  I do try to be conservative, but after watching this documentary my husband and I decided to make even more drastic changes to help preserve the resources we have for our future!  I hope you watch it as soon as possible and become inspired to do your part as well!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|From all the talk surrounding it, I was really expecting a loud, angry rock album a la Alanis Morissette style.  I was disappointed to find only a couple \\"let it out\\" kind of bitter songs on this album and the rest I found sad and mournful. An entire album? Really Kelly?  It started to depress me and then just bore me.  Had I known, I'd have just downloaded singles \\"Never Again\\" and maybe \\"Hole\\".
B000TSIK14|4.0|I've always preferred the Uli Jon Roth 70s era Scorpions to anything that came after and you'd have to go all the way back to 1982's \\"Blackout\\" to find a Scorpions album that I thought had more good songs on it than bad.<br /><br />But a friend was playing this in the car recently and I have to admit I like it. Liked it enough to get a copy myself. And like it more every time I listen to it. (Humanity, The Cross and Love is War caught my ear immediately!!) It's even made me curious about some of the other stuff I've missed; now I'll have to look at the rest of their more recent material and give the ones with the highest reviews a listen.<br /><br />But I have to say, you folks out there giving this 5 stars....it isn't Animal Magnetism or Blackout...so don't get carried away!! If you give this 5 stars then what do you reserve for those two? For the superbly magnificent Tokyo Tapes?<br /><br />Bottom line, if, like me, you gave up on the Scorpions when they became \\"Hair-metal\\", give this CD a listen, it's pretty darn good.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I didn't grow up watching Seinfeld, however my friends all told me to watch this great show. I bought the first six volumes from Amazon.com for an amazing deal. As I watch the seasons, it got better every year. It's just a classic, and I can't comment on this season just yet. I'm sure when I do it'll be another great seasoned show, however for those who are collecting this great show, it's a great add to finish off the entire collection. I do admit when I first saw this on Amazon, the price was not looking good. They do now have a great price and I just can't wait for this to be shipped.
0812932293|5.0|This is probably the best book I've ever read so far. Its not a business book, so read it as you would \\"literature\\" over a weekend... but its filled with great entertaining stories and helps you see how this guy's life has been.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|...in other words, a one note solo, and pointless.    If you have a foot fetish, click the \\"buy now\\" button. Many shots of female feet stuck out of car windows. Sort of like the Bridget Fonda foot fetish riff from \\"Jackie Brown\\" and the Salma Hayek foot fetish riff from \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" multiplied tenfold. No shortage of feet in this film.    After that, it's all senseless violence. \\"Kill Bill\\" with closeups of feet.    The Rose McGowan sequence was particularly cynical, cruel, pointless and vulgar. Quentin, you're not a genius. You're a sick and twisted nerd on a studio budget.    This is NOT \\"Tarantino's best movie since Pulp Fiction.\\" Deal with it.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Thought this was way better then the first movie and dont understand why its received criticism. I'm 27 so maybe I just relate more to the fact that there is some real emotion to the plot and at least one of the songs to go along with the fantastic upbeat tracks that I've even found myself singing at work! Anyway it's well worth watching even by those who may have found the first a bit cheesy.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|If everything could ever feel this real forever. If anything could ever be this good again. The only thing I'll ever ask of you ... you've got to promise not to stop when I say when.    Thats not me getting poetic, its the lyrics to the Foo Fighter's song \\"Everlong\\" and also the way it makes me feel while hearing it. Actually I'm hearing the acoustic version of it from their live acoustic album - Skin and Bones.    I have to admit, I have rocked to Foo Fighters songs in the past but have never until this very moment realized how deep their lyrics are. I never really gave the album version of \\"Everlong\\" much thought. I don't know if it was the weird video that put me off or the fact that Dave Grohl is screaming his lungs out which completely ruins the sentiment of the song for me.    A band shows its true metal on an acoustic performance and this is where Foo Fighters shines. I have to say Skin and Bones is one of the best live performances I have heard. The band puts so much energy into their live performance that you can even feel it off a pre-recorded cd. Dave's voice takes you through a range of emotions and on some of the tracks he goes from slow and peaceful to hard and heavy seamlessly. This live performance will take you through a gamut of emotions, from love, to heart break, to betrayal, to sentimental.    The acoustic version of Everlong has hit a chord with me, it makes me want to laugh, cry, be in love, all at the same time! I can't make up my mind if the song is that brilliant or I am going through a hormonal change!      Some of the other notable tracks on the disk: -    Best of You -    I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool. Everyone's got their chains to break, holding you. My heart is under arrest again, but I'll break loose.    I think we all have been under someones spell at some time or the other and needed to break loose. I can relate.      Walking After You -    If you'd accept surrender, give up some more. If you walk out on me, I'm walking after you.    Poetic!      My Hero -    There goes my hero, watch him as he goes. There goes my hero ... he's ordinary!    I can't quite figure out if Dave means ordinary people are heroes or he means that we worship people / celebrities and they turn out to be ordinary people. Either way, an awesome song!      Times Like These -    It's times like these you learn to live again. It's times like these you give and give again. It's times like these you learn to love again. It's times like these time and time again.    A song about recovering from ... whatever. I love this song, second only to Everlong.      People do yourselves a favor and go out and buy this disk. Buy it, download it, rip it, steal it, I don't care! Just get it!    But seriously, this is one of those few disks worth burning a hole in your wallet for.
1596912855|4.0|Although it took maybe 50 pages to begin the novel properly, I rather enjoyed the purposeful reflection of the characters of Jane Austen.  The book receives 4 instead of 5 because of the writing style.  It improves as you go through the book, but at the beginning, there just isn't enough fluidity to capture the story or ones interest.  Overall, I enjoyed the chance to be present in Austenland through the reading of the book, and yes, would read another one in likeness.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Blade Runner is a movie based in Los Angeles in 2019. The environment is pretty much destroyed, and industrialization triumphs over nature. The result is no viable nature whatsoever, but a Mega-opolis in pretty much Post Apocalyptic Earth( the native language is a mix of Hungarian, Chinese, Japanese and English)    The story involves 6 replicants that have escaped from an Off World colony( as they were slaves) and have come to exact revenge, or a longer lifespan if they can. However there is more to it than just that... the replicant's have 4 year lifespan for fear they become aware of their own emotions, and do irrational things.    Deckard is a former Blade Runner, re-commissioned by his old boss to hunt down the 4. He sees that not only are the replicants more Human than expected, they outgrow their programming and ARE living, breath physical objects.    The story is ironic as well as tragic as the replicants die, as near the end Deckard is skeptical if he is one as well. However, this is a great movie Rutger Hauer's first American movie, and Harrison Ford fresh off Return of The Jedi is excellent. Highly recommended for Sci-Fi fanatics.    I have the original directors cut within my possession, I am looking forward however to getting the 4 disc special edition to see the major differences in the edits.
B0006399FS|5.0|Nothing. I don't understand some of the reviews on this site about this album. No, its not a masterpiece album, but its still a great album by this group. The only two complaints I have about this album is the awful artwork which is dull and the misleading title (most of the songs are about relationships).    What sets this album apart from their recent last albums are the grooves. I love \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Man and A Woman\\" because the songs are so intense lyrically and musically. The touching \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is about the complex relationship between Bono and his late father. \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is a plea from Bono to rich nations to provide aid to poor countries like Africa. Other songs like \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" shows a return to the group rock past, which is what everyone wanted. All the songs are touching and deep, except for \\"Vertigo\\". That song is a good lead off song, but it seems immature to me coming from a group like U2.    I know people expect U2 to make masterpieces all the time, but I think this album is moving them in the right direction to the next phase of their career. I am not blind by their fame, I will put them on blast if I think they are not growing as artists or if they are coasting off their previous fame (like the Rolling Stones). However, I think the band really tries to challenge themselves with each album. They totally deserved all the awards they won for this album. Don't be surprise in a couple more years, people start to look at this album differently...just like U2's POP, I think this album will grow on fans.
1891252089|5.0|I have been looking at quite a few books and videos on Ashtanga/Power Yoga and find Mr. Swenson's book and DVD's/CD's by far the best product out there. I prefer self study and have not always much time for long workouts due to travel, etc. David's approach allows me to squeeze in some Yoga every day of my life and the many variations he provides make my practice develop over time. Most useful is David's attempt to make your practice independent of all media. By now I can practice on my own with no aids wherever I want. I might have 15 min (likely) or 2h (unlikely). All I need is a bit of space and a mat or towel. In fact just the other week I was for business travel in Singapore. I got up early due to jet lag and went outdoor pool side in my hotel. The following 90 min practice gave me a great workout and equanimity. The following day with meetings etc. was much easier to endure.       I have been intrigued by body weight exercises since a long time. Why would you use all sort of equipment if your body provides you with a universe of opportunities to build strength, flexibility and stamina/endurance?    Another gtreat book I recommend is Daniel Lyon's \\"Pilates for Men\\".
B000SO7OMA|5.0|I got this as a gift from my husband on my birthday.. I just love watching it.  The variety of instruments paired with the timeless enchantment of Lorenna makes this a masterpiece for any Lorenna Fan to have in their collection.  I love that the CD's come with this DVD.. I can keep those in my car for traveling, and watch the DVD at home when I want my Lorenna Fix.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Without any doubt Superman The Movie is the best superhero movie of all time(sorry Spider-Man).It exceeds in everything: great acting, direction, cinematography, plot. It has everything you can ask for a movie, action , comedy, romance, adventure.  All in all, STM went to be one of the most popular films of the 70's, and of all time. Alot of people like to critisize the fact that the SFX has not hold well over the years, and compare it to recent blocbusters like [[ASIN:B00005JPFH Spider-Man 3 (2-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men (Widescreen Edition)]]. Hello? This was 1977-1978. 30 years already has passed, and people are still talking how this movie has influenced today's movies.In my opinion the film has aged well, and remains a true classic to enjoy over and over again for years to come.I highly recommend this DVD.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|There are two different versions of this album.  One, the core album of 11 songs, and another 2 disc version that contains an additional 4 songs.  The version with the additional material contains what in my opinion is one of the best things the band has ever recorded in the track Ocean Cloud.  It is everything that Marillion fans have come to love over the years and a progressive rock triumph to my ears.  Unfortunately the band choose not to put this track on the single disc version (and the one most people have) of this album which is a pity.   Even without Ocean Cloud the single disc version of Marbles is a very good album.  This is another one that reaps additional rewards after further listens.  The album did not blow me away at first, but because the nature of the majority of this album is quietly forceful it does not bang you over the head upon first listen.  This, like Brave is a Marillion album that really needs to be listened to on a good stereo or with headphones.  The album is a mix of more commercial oriented tracks and the not so commercial.  The album opens with a fantastic tune The Invisible Man that showcases Hogarth at his best.  In fact the opening and closing tune Neverland rank up with some of the best work Hogarth has ever done.  Don't Hurt Yourself is a cool single with Steve Rothary doing some very nice acoustic guitar work.  Angelina and Drilling Holes are both solid too.  Marbles continues the resurgence of Marillion.  They have remained true to their muse while both updating their sound and at the same time staying true to their roots.  Marbles is another fine album in the Marillion catalogue.

THE STORIE , THE ACTORS,THE BEAUTIFULL LANDSCAPE,THE MUSIC ,THE LIGHT,THE COSTUMES ,THE WAY IT IS MADE, ALL IS SO AUTHENTIC.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I have never been a fan of musicals. This was the first time I ever watched this film. I have seen small pieces of it, but never cared to watch it. I have the 2 disc set and I was amazed at the transfer and sound. This is the way musicals should be done. The songs are memorable and there is a good story with dialogue! I watched \\"The King and I\\" which I really liked and then \\"Oklahoma\\" which bored me to death! If your not a musical fan \\"The Sound of Music is the place to start. The story will hold your interest, the kids are charming and Julie Andrews is a very talented captivating beauty! It's a 3 hour movie, but it did move along at a fairly quick pace.
0380713802|4.0|Bill Bryson's humor is, as always, top-flight.  One reviewer mentioned a series of jokes that he found \\"tiring\\" ... personally I found the caricatures very funny.  Of course Bryson's comments are generalizations, many of them over-generalizations for humor's sake, many of them are grossly inaccurate I am sure.  But the reality is that we *all* generalize, and while I understand the European point of view, I would ask the critics of this book who cry xenophobia to think about all of the over-generalizations Europeans have of America and Americans.  But hey, we're all entitled to our own opinion, and humor perhaps more than anything is something that is lost in translation.  I don't think the European audience is the one Bryson is targeting anyway, and I'm sure there exist many books in Europe that lampoon America to a degree that most Americans would similarly take offense at.  C'est la vie.<br /><br />While the humor itself rates 5 stars, the \\"travel\\" part is 3~4 stars at best.  I do agree with the critics that note Bryson's somewhat formulaic style becomes a little weary after a while, and aside from the funny stories and interludes, Bryson's travels are actually on the dull side.  In many ways, it felt like a sequel that was a watered down version of the original--I wondered if Bryson wouldn't have been better off writing about just his *original* youthful travels around Europe with Katz instead of this version we had--Europe: Part Deux.  Bryson himself seemed to lose interest in his own travels around Italy, and often it felt like he was more interested to leave the last town than to enter the next one.  By Istanbul, Bryson was clearly just going through the motions.  Bryson's general lack of attachment to these places keeps the reader at arm's length as well.<br /><br />In the end, I think the reader's opinion of this book will depend on how the humor is received.  If you don't find it funny, this book will be a miserable read.  For me, and I believe most people, the humor is hilarious enough and the flashbacks are interesting enough to carry the reader's interest from beginning to end.  Still, I agree with those who say it does not match the level of Bryson's other works.  The style remains but this book is missing a bit of the soul that makes Bryson's works such interesting and entertaining reads.ilarious enough and the flashbacks are interesting enough to carry the reader's interest from beginning to end.

0316067598|5.0|I just finished reading Lone Survivor and imagine my relief when I realized that I wasn't having a heart attack while I was reading Marcus' wonderful first hand account.  It was actually my heart swelling with pride for this terrific man and his buddies, as well as all our servicemen.  As I finished this beautiful, but heartbreaking, story, I was trying to think of who could play Marcus and his SEAL friends in the movie that is sure to be filmed one day.  The only person who could possibly fill Marcus' big shoes (sorry Marcus! Loved the way you kept pointing out your size throughout the pages, however) would be John Wayne, himself.  Since he is gone, however, I can't think of another actor who would do justice.  Therefore, my vote goes for Marcus to play himself as fellow Texan, Audie Murphy, had to in his movie, To Hell And Back.  Lone Survivor is a fantastic, hard to put down, read from page one to page 391.  I read it in 3 days and I would have continued reading for 24 hours, if my body allowed.  Great things are sure to come of this wonderful SEAL.  I don't believe we've heard the last of him!  This is a book I'll be reading again and again.  Thanks, Marcus.  You did your buddies a beautiful tribute in Lone Survivor.  They're are up there rooting for you all the way.  Don't fret negative reviews from libs, they only saw themselves in your book and were embarrassed. Good luck in Med School, if that's what you still plan to do.  I haven't met you personnally, but I'll gladly send a letter of recommendation!  God bless the USA, President Bush, Marcus Littrell, family and friends, SEALS present and past, and Texas!

B000R7HY0K|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. I enjoy 60s-70s Grindhouse. I like the idea of paying homeage to an overlooked genre. I REALLY like Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Ferlito. But I don't like Quentin Tarantino. The guy is a blowhard and the ability to write and direct a decent movie has obviously passed him by. This movie was so bad that I nodded off twice. The second time I fell asleep I actually spilled my soda all over my new silk boxer shorts and woke up really ticked off. Quentin you owe me $2.75 for my dry cleaning bill!!
0385512058|2.0|After significant media PR, I went out and bought this book. Like that great movie your friends (the media) say that you have to see, this one is a pass.   After you cut through the fluff, there are two important concepts to be taken away from this book: 1) always be networking and 2) the most effective way to network is to think about how many ways you can give value, provide leads, or be of service to those in your professional network - this goodwill granted will come back to you in spades.
B00006D295|3.0|If this movie has a redeemining quality it's in its music. I liked many of the songs. However, the rest of it is simply so campy as to be like an R-Rated version of an episode of the original Batman TV show.<br /><br />Yes, I know it's a cult classic. This is one of the reasons I decided to watch it. And I can't really say it's a BAD movie, as many of the actors in this film have since gone on to do wonderful work. The cinemetography and such was well-done. But the movie is just plain WEIRD. It's like someone asked a couple of 15-year-old boys to write the plot for the ultimate movie.<br /><br />A couple of WEIRD 15 year old boys.
0316010669|4.0|Gladwell is a superb, captivating storyteller.  He opens the book with some compelling examples to support his principal objective of the book: the \\"task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we can acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as months of rational analysis.\\"  He amply succeeds in accomplishing his objective yet you can't help being left wanting for how we can opportunistically leverage our instincts versus when we should sit back and take a deep breath and analyze.  That being said, I enjoyed the book and found the topic to be important.  And the book passes my ultimate screen of a subject well explored that I will remember for years to come.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|36 of 37 people found the following review helpful: April 6, 2007     Anyone who has seen AMISTAD or ROOTS needs to see the Michael Apted directed AMAZING GRACE which predates and fills in so much of the political and humanistic tug of war that existed concerning the awful dirty business of the African Slave Trade.Hollywood could not have conjectured a more true film than the actual true and inspiring life of William Wilberforce,a revered heroic figure in England,who,with the help of other abolitionists and political sympathizers,takes on the English Parliament and wins legislation to finally end the Slave Trade in 1807.This movie is SO significant because it is this piece of history that leads other European nations to follow suit in subsequent years and eventually to abolish the trade worldwide.Michael Apted has skillfully rescued this story from being another biopic,and has turned it into a sweeping epic that rings historically true.  No finer actor could have been chosen to play Wilberforce than the Emmy Award winning Welsh marvel Ioan Gruffudd,pronounced YO-an Griffith( HORATIO HORNBLOWER,SOLOMON AND GAENOR,VERY ANNIE MARY).Gruffudd positively understands the heart and soul of Wilberforce,and delivers a tender yet dynamic knockout performance of this absolutely giant among men whose inner convictions and powerful and persuasive rhetoric eventually win over Parliament in a nearly twenty year life-and-death struggle.  This film brings tremendously true and historical understanding of the political machine that was (and frankly still is) in place from 1785 to 1807.Historical figures argue and debate their opposing views while the lives of millions of innocent Africans and the fortunes and supremacies of national pride hang in the balance.The film moves swiftly and is not preachy or at all heavy-handed in any direction.It simply tells and honest and riveting true-to-life story.Some characters and events are combined together to compact the screenplay,but no truth is lost in the outcome.  The film takes it's name from the famous 18th-century renowned hymn AMAZING GRACE,written by the Anglican minister John Newton,who had,years earlier,himself been an active and ardent participant in the selling of African flesh.John Newton is portrayed (a bit much like a crazy old celibate monk) by veteran actor Albert Finney in one of the smaller supporting supporting roles.Though much of what Newton says in the film is directly from his own memoirs,he was a married man,who,historically,valued his wife as his best friend.Now in his declining years,Newton,who has in later years been Rector of a London Church,is sought out by Wilberforce,who sat under Newton's pulpit as a child,to have the old minister help him in the cause of exposing the Slave Trade in all of it's ugliness.As was true in Newton's real life,Finney shows that this is the singlemost painful event in Newton's life thus making it next to impossible to discuss.The film directs Newton and Wilberforce over the course of the twenty years in order for the awful truth to come forth.Proof was necessary to persuade Parliament, and Newton was a key piece to passing the abolitionist legislation.  Up and coming actor Benedict Cumberbatch accurately conveys William Pitt The Younger,in his boyhood friendship with Wilberforce and his subsequent rise to Prime Minister of England.What is inspiring about their relationship is that all of their political idealism comes to fruition showing the power and perseverance that these two young men had in fighting an age old institution that threatened to destabilize all of England.Other historical figures in this film such as Lord Tarlton (the ever amazing Ciaran Hinds)and Equiano (Youssou N'dour),Toby Jones as Lord Clarence (this actor seems to be able to play EVERYTHING!!!) and actors Michael Gambon as Sir Charles Fox do the utmost to bring this film to the heart and consciences of the world today.  This film is simply NOT just another period piecedrama or an \\"inspirational\\" film;rather it is an artfully scripted,deftly acted and directed and compelling piece of historical drama that all will benefit from viewing.Again,5 *****'s is not sufficient.May there be more films of such quality and substance made like this!  Excellent companion films would be A RESPECTABLE TRADE,THE MIDDLE PASSAGE,AMISTAD,THE VOYAGE OF LA AMISTAD, MANSFIELD PARK (1999) and somewhat ROOTS.
0224076051|5.0|The \\"science fictional\\" elements of string theory have a tremendous appeal to me, frankly, so the physics presentations I've gone to and seen on video were virtually always string-theoretical in nature. Since I'm not paid to do physics, I only paid attention to the most exciting stuff. We were lucky enough to have Fenyman lecture to a couple of my physics classes, but the presentation I went to by him later was on nanoengineering, for instance, because that's cool and scifi-ish. I read the Feynman Lectures and lately worked my way through Penrose's Road to Reality. I have to say, the periodic admission or criticism that string theory, M-theory, branes+string etc. had not progressed made me wonder why it was so prominent, but I basically assumed that it was the high cost of testing it at fault, and also assumed that, frankly, the top physics researchers, including people like Hawking, knew what they were doing. I can't blame my professors, my physics study was very basic, Standard Model stuff in my 1st year of grad school (after which I stopped taking physics courses). And then and undergrad I wasn't that big on cosmology, I was into energy and thermal statistical physics and basic math tools. It was after that when a lot of my reading was popular physics books like The First Three Minutes that I basically assumed string theory had won out.<br /><br />Thanks to this book (kind of the straw that broke the camel's back, frankly), I am going to look at and attend no more presentations on tachyon theory and smeared branes and so on. (You could do a whole geek-zombie comic book, I think, about students who turn into zombies studying the d-braned theories of inarticulate p-branes, shambling around calling out braaaanes.).<br /><br />If you haven't read it, NEW's not stumping for anything else, not twistor theory, not steady state, not loop quantum gravity, nada. Purely establishing the negative. That's a tremendous plus. Also, I don't feel qualified to make the kind of metascientific judgment it would need to arrive at Peter Woit's position.<br /><br />It seems to me more likely that the people who say you can reconfigure string theory as a convention of some sort are right. That does not mean I support the idea you can directly make string theory match conventional spacetime 4-dimensions field theory, but rather that you can PROBABLY find ways to model all the things that the string theory program gets when it uses extra compactified dimensions or branes.<br /><br />I think Academician Prokhor Zakharov should have the last word, however, since his analysis was prescient:<br /><br />\\"A brave little theory; and actually, quite coherent for a system of 5 or 7 dimensions. If only we lived in one!\\"ment it would need to arrive at Peter Woit's position.

1594489505|5.0|This was a very fascinating and touching read.  The author gives us insight into a world we only hear about on the news.  I could not put the book down for long, and I even cried in some places.  I have enjoyed both of his books (The Kite Runner), and I look forward to any future novels he may publish.
B000S0DDG0|4.0|They did a great job of evoking the era of Diana Ross and her contemporaries.  So many scenes, set pieces, costumes, and songs in this movie rekindled vivid memories.  Beyonce is gorgeous to look at, from the opening scenes where her character is still green, unpolished, cute and bubbly, to later where she's a mega-star.  Jennifer Hudson sings with the power and beauty to move audiences to tears.  Eddie Murphy is an unexpected scene stealer.  I had no idea he had that in him.  He's great in his on-stage performances as a singer, and equally great in his dramatic scenes.  I loved this movie; it will probably be one I watch several times.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|Not for the squeamish, but the everyone in The Departed put in such a stellar performance...several were up for Academy Awards...that it was worth cringing a bit at times. Surprise ending. Loved this movie!
075640407X|4.0|My husband borrowed this from the library for me based on it's great reviews.  Initialy, I started to read it quickly as I had a deadline.  It's a long book for me to read in three weeks.  Then I couldn't put it down.  I couldn't wait for my son to nap so I can sneak in some more!
B00005JPTA|2.0|I loved History of Violence so, this movie looked intriguing from the comercials. It ended up being a drawn out and boring movie punctuated by graphic violence WITH NO RESOLUTION. You'll spend 90 minutes following a mildly interesting story (centering around a pregnant 14 year old that you don't really find out enough about to care about) only to have the credits start rolling just when you should be starting to find something out or getting some resolution...(ala the Soprano's ending).     The touts of a historic fight scene aren't because the fighting is something that we haven't seen before but, because Viggo Mortensen is naked for the entire scene, flopping around during intermittent punches, cuts, and stabbings...I think the full frontal male nudity from an \\"A-list\\" star is what is being called historic here.    Sat here for 2 hours following this story and don't get the results from the DNA testing and don't get to see if/how the Russian father is overthrown? Why did I waste my time? The best part of the story is missing...    If you must see it, rent it.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The Lives of Others is a brilliant film. Students of the Cold War and of the former German Democratic Republic will recognize this immediately. Through the tale told in this film the drab mediocrity, the harshness and the sadness of lives imprisoned by communism in East Germany come to full, rich and complex life. The stress and the terror of a totalitarian state and the degrading betrayals made by its citizens in helpless circumstances are delicately interwoven to bring both the lives and moods to realistic portrayal. This is not a Tom Clancyesque film of intrigue; viewers looking for action and visual gratification should seek other films.    While the depth of the German language is lost in clunky translation, the mediocrity of life behind the Iron Curtain is starkly brought to life. The stark and harsh tones used to color the film, the blocky unpainted housing, the lack of Trabant cars on the spacious socialist city boulevards,--even the dissident circles look cheaply dressed--it all blends to recreate the dreary mood of life in 1980s East Germany.    The characters are all played flawlessly, but particular note goes to that of the main character, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler. He slowly transforms from true believer in the Socialist ideal and faithful servant of the DDR regime to questioning individual to the silent and ghostlike protector of Georg Dreyman, the dissident he was assigned to destroy for a Party apparatchik's personal motives. As a true believer, his transformation to thinking and sympathetic human being is all the more poignant as it practically destroys him in the end. Perhaps the saddest and most heartbreaking scene is when Dreyman locates Wiesler two years after the collapse of the Wall and the GDR itself: we see Wiesler, former stiffly uniformed Hauptmann of the Stasi secret police, now walking dejectedly in a rundown section of Berlin, resignedly delivering mail from a beat up mail cart to beat up mailboxes.     The near two and a half hours ofthe film is necessary and welcome as it allows for full plot development and denouement. Seeing Wiesler in the final scene, recognizing his actions had good consequences and finally doing a small thing for himself, is the film's smallest but most powerful moment. This is a film that will grip the soul.
B0000024ZC|5.0|Gentle Giant wasn't really a popular band back in the 70's, but they sure made some of the most exciting and different rock music you've probably ever heard.  \\"Prologue\\" opens the album with an evil-sounding electric progressive riff.  \\"Schooldays\\" is funny because you can instantly tell it's an early 70's song because of the vocals, but there's moments of extraordinary vocal bits that really stretch beyond what ordinary rock bands were (and are) capable of.  Sort of like how Jefferson Airplane is perfectly pleasant and listenable most of the time even though the music is quite often bizarre.  Same thing with Gentle Giant.  \\"Working All Day\\" continues that theme.    \\"Peel the Paint\\" is like an old fashioned folk song mixed with classical elements and an extended guitar jam in the middle.  Can't say there's anything else quite like it out there, that's for sure.  \\"Mister Class and Quality\\" is a really upbeat rocker with solid vocals, and it serves as the first half of the more hypnotic and dreamy title song, which is brilliantly heavy at first and eventually soothing and gives off a relaxing swimming-under-the-sea vibe that's totally awesome.  A classic album.

Just to tell you the love for the CD I have...it was one of my top CD's of all time...Loved it back when it first came out and I still love it 10 years later...

B00008OLYN|5.0|By far one of my favorite CD's that I own and out of a collection of 600 thats a lot to say for it, Opeth does it again with another masterpiece this time on the softer side of things. All singing and minimal growling...a melodic masterpeice which is pleasure to the hearing. Anyone with a feel for melodic metal or music in general would be doing themself a great favor by picking up this album...I liked it so much I spent the 20 bucks that the chain music stores charge when it came out...and I would do it again if I had to...

6304196938|4.0|Ernest Lehman's screenplay for 'North by Northwest' must have caught Hitch's eye from the start--it's so typical of the kind of film he loved to make (a man on the run from unseen or unknown enemies). He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor and sexual innuendo with the usual blonde femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint) providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.<br /><br />It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.<br /><br />As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows. An all-time great that has to rank as one of Grant's and Hitchcock's best films.<br /><br />Trivia note: Watch the goof in the scene where Eva Marie Saint shoots the gun at Grant in the dining room. A small boy at a nearby table in the background covers his ears to muffle the shot just before anyone is aware of the gun's existence.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|The film is stylish and highly entertaining.  Kate Beckinsale gave a stellar performance in this movie.

B0009SOFGI|5.0|Update- March 16, 2011    I've decided to update my rating to a perfect 5 stars because, to be totally honest, I didn't GET this album at first.  I didn't really get the early and obvious influence of the punk rock movement this album would be responsible for, nor did I appreciate Iggy Pop's vocals.      Most importantly however, I didn't appreciate the 10-minute \\"We Will Fall\\".  I must not have been paying close enough attention when I first heard it 10 years ago, because the wah wah pedals never even seemed noticeable to me back then, and the constant ominous chanting on the part of the background vocals that seemed to drag initially have actually improved *considerably* and make total sense when paying close enough attention to the lyrics.  Excellent song that I completely didn't get at first, and I apologize for that.  The atmosphere itself is another aspect of the song that floors me.  I can't say I've ever experienced anything like it before.  I do wish the viola didn't take so long to make an appearance though (all the way until the final minute).  That thing is spooky as heck when it finally reveals itself.    Many of the other songs tend to blend together in my mind, such as \\"1969\\", \\"Little Doll\\" and perhaps the best of the bunch, \\"No Fun\\".  These three songs in particular seem to be based on the same pattern but it's not a *bad* thing by any means.  A lot of music out there blends together and it honestly doesn't matter in the slightest, especially when similarities are only noticeable when it concerns bands with their own unique style, which defines the Stooges.    Perhaps \\"Not Right\\" makes me think about the Ramones because the guitar riff alone is arguably more punk-ish than the rest of the album.  If \\"Ann\\" is supposed to qualify as a ballad, well, all I can say is that it's one really twisted and bizarre ballad!  Still, my favorite song just HAS to be \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\".  Iggy's voice sounds pretty darn cool on this track, and he almost seems to imitate the guitar tone which is very very odd... and awesome.      Besides that, the guitar playing is honestly a tad thin compared to the tone the Stooges would have on their next two albums, and Iggy resembles Mick Jagger on several occasions, but besides these two minor setbacks, this album is pure classic without a single weak point if you ask me.
B000TGELLY|4.0|When I saw TROY in the theaters, I wasn't expecting much. After that first viewing, I knew there was something missing; the screenplay just didn't grab me, it failed to immerse me on the scenes. I am quite familiar with GREEK myths, also both Norse and Roman mythology. Well, I managed to purchase the director's cut of Troy, and although it is not as great as KINGDOM of HEAVEN Director's cut, it is a better cut of the film.<br /><br />I presume that most of the folks who'll be interested in the director's cut are fans or at least the ones who saw it in theaters as I did. ONE OBVIOUS improvement this version has over the previous dvd is the PICTURE transfer. The Video this time out is more vibrant, sharper and cleaner. Another difference is the SOUNDTRACK on certain scenes; the training scene of Achilles and his cousin, the duel between Hector and Achilles. Also, the music is improved with added bass during the siege at the beach and on the gates of Troy. The music sounded more powerful.<br /><br />The Director's cut has the same plotlines, characters and scenes. It does have added \\"meat\\" and do they make Troy a better cut of the film? Yes.<br /><br />1: Opening scene with a dog going around the spoils of war. (Dead bodies)<br />2: Nudity in the scene between Paris and Helen. Their relationship is also a bit more fleshed out. Love scenes are extended, suffice it to say, the film is a bit more uninhibited when it comes to nudity.<br />3: Helen's husband is shown as unfaithful. It gives more motivation to Helen's actions.<br />4: Odysseus is developed as the humble King of Ithaca. He likes to be among the common folk.  His character is also more fleshed out; the film also emphasizes how it is Achilles trusts his judgment.<br />5: Hector knew about Paris' affair with Helen even before they boarded the ship back to Troy. He warns him of the potential consequences.<br />6: Achilles' ego is more fleshed out.  He has a confrontation with Agamemnon regarding the Priestess of Apollo. (Extended)<br />7: Extended battle sequences. More blood is shown. Heads get lopped off more often.<br />8: Funeral sequences are extended. It shows more emotion and emphasizes the combatants' sorrow with the lost of their comrades.<br />9: A dog licks off the \\"fake\\" disease after the Trojans took the wooden horse inside their city.<br />10: Agamemnon's obsession and arrogance is more fleshed out.<br />11: Extended final act sequence; last assault on the city of Troy. More blood and gore is shown. A tad more brutally graphic.<br /><br />There may be more that I missed, it did contain an added 30+ minutes of footage. The film is contained in 2 discs (2 Dual layer DVDs) similar to the terrific extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven Director's cut.<br /><br />VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.35 Anamorphic widescreen. Exceptional transfer, an improvement over the previous dvd release; Near-flawless picture quality, nice colors, improved sharpness and contrast. Black levels are solid. 5.1 Dolby Digital English is very powerful. I'd had hoped that this cut would include DTS sound mix, it would have been better with DTS.<br /><br />In closing: Is the director's cut worth a \\"double dip\\"? For me, for $ 14.99 2-disc edition director's cut, definitely yes! As for the other more \\"stylish\\" Ultimate Edition (includes photo book etc.)with the $ 25.99-$ 34.99 price tag, I'm not so sure. For fans of the film, or if you don't have the original release, this is a no-brainer. The lack of DTS track is a minus, but this new edition definitely has a bit more \\"grandeur\\" than the theatrical release.<br />However, if you hated the original cut, this new director's cut will NOT change your mind!<br />Recommended! (timidly) ( 3 ½ stars)nces. More blood is shown. Heads get lopped off more often.  8: Funeral sequences are extended. It shows more emotion and emphasizes the combatants' sorrow with the lost of their comrades.  9: A dog licks off the \\"fake\\" disease after the Trojans took the wooden horse inside their city.  10: Agamemnon's obsession and arrogance is more fleshed out.  11: Extended final act sequence; last assault on the city of Troy.

Black levels are solid. 5.1 Dolby Digital English is very powerful. I'd had hoped that this cut would include DTS sound mix, it would have been better with DTS.    In closing: Is the director's cut worth a \\"double dip\\"? For me, for $ 14.99 2-disc edition director's cut, definitely yes! As for the other more \\"stylish\\" Ultimate Edition (includes photo book etc.)with the $ 25.99-$ 34.99 price tag, I'm not so sure. For fans of the film, or if you don't have the original release, this is a no-brainer. The lack of DTS track is a minus, but this new edition definitely has a bit more \\"grandeur\\" than the theatrical release.  However, if you hated the original cut, this new director's cut will NOT change your mind!  Recommended! (timidly) ( 3 ½ stars)
B000MCIBE8|5.0|I have one distinct memory of the Doors debut.  When I was like five or six years old, I liked to go upstairs to a room we called \\"the pool room\\" and play pool while listening to Doors music on a small tape player/recorder.  I'd stay in the room for practically hours just playing the Doors over and over again, perfecting my pool-playing skills!  The debut album was one of my favorites as a child, and I still consider it a special listen.  Talk about an album that sounds nothing like what other bands were doing at the time.  I think that's what grabbed me the most- the Doors sounded like no one else, and to this day, even though plenty of imitators have tried copying their sound, no one has been able to capture the magic of Jim Morrison's vocals and lyrics.  A truly special band.  \\"Light My Fire\\" has remained my favorite song all these years later.  The best jam ever put on record.
B00005JPLW|1.0|I'm having a hard time coming up with words to express my contempt for this idiotic, brutal, homophobic garbage. I was dragged to see it in the theatre and emerged feeling as though I had been beaten about the head and shoulders with a heavy stick. The action sequences are brutish and repetitive, the characters are essentially nonexistent, the dialogue is stilted and bloody-minded, and the whole enterprise felt like a video game. The world would be a better place if this movie had never been made.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Try as some might, but you can't hate this album or the Alan Parsons Project for that matter.  They're too gifted when it comes to writing memorable songs consistently album after album.  \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" is the big hit.  You've heard it lots of times.  It's a shame you don't hear it as much now as you used to.    \\"Breakdown\\" is an interesting song because I originally thought it was a Fleetwood Mac song.  Sounds like it, doesn't it?  Something Lindsey Buckingham would write.  \\"Don't Let it Show\\" has the perfect \\"floating\\" atmosphere we've come to expect from the band, not to mention a song that brings back personal memories for me.  \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" is simply BEAUTIFUL!  I love it!    Buy this album.

B000000W5L|3.0|I was never thrilled with the Rolling Stones supposed biggest album (though Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers are probably more popular) titled \\"Exile on Main Street\\".  Some of these tracks are absolutely great and filled with emotion such as \\"Sweet Virginia\\", \\"Torn and Frayed\\", and \\"Loving Cup\\".  I also love the speedy and catchy \\"All Down the Line\\" and I also believe \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" is a pretty neat song.  \\"Shine a Light\\" is pretty good as well.      So what happens after that?  We're exposed to some really annoying tracks such as \\"Shake Your Hips\\", \\"Casino Boogie\\" and \\"Tumbling Dice\\", while other tunes like the closing rocker \\"Soul Survivor\\" is overlong, pointless and boring.  However, I think critics were wrong to bash the album at the time of its release because it doesn't sound like the band sold out or anything.  It still SOUNDS like the good ol' rock and roll sound we've heard countless times before.  Also, the Stones would go on to have better and more consistently pleasing albums after this one.  This is just an album with lots of filler.
0307277887|5.0|Dexter is a sympathetic character who happens not to have normal human feelings. Moreover, he harbors the Dark Passenger deep in his psyche, and his other persona is a viciouse, libidinal killer. Despite all of this, Dexter is an engaging and interesting person who you will want to get to know.. as long as he's only in a book. Excellent writing, humorous and dark.
B000T05R8Q|2.0|You may have read my previous review, so dig this.  Understand my two star rating is on the expectation of what you are getting; 'Piper' alone is a five star classic, yes, even the mono version!     Don't get me wrong, there are things to like in it, but it is really not putting the best foot forward to those fans who will hear this mono version first. Yes, I know this mono version was mixed on June 29 & 30, 1967 and was cut on July 13th and side one was re-cut on July 20th, and that all four members were present for the mono mixing. I also know that the stereo version was kinda slabbed together in a mad rush for release (one day of two sessions totaling 9 hours) on July 18, 1967. And just to leave no stone unturned, I know that the Floyd wasn't there for the stereo mixing and that in those days they didn't even monitor in stereo. BUT, it is really hard to argue that the mono version sounds better, though I do hate the wild panning on the stereo version of 'Interstellar Overdrive'.     In stereo, Syd's voice and guitar are much more prevalent. The mono version is simply interesting at best. As a side note, when the Floyd was given the final mono version for release, they remarked, \\"I guess it will work.\\"; that's not exactly an enthusiastic response. I think fans 40 years later are looking for some sort of relic, some great version that was lost to the ages and finally unearthed. It is good, yes, but not great. And I like the extra musical bits of the unreleased 'Matilda Mother', but the singing and words are really awful, not much missed there.    Like other reviewers, I would like to have seen some finely remastered versions of some oddities like: 'Lucy Leave', 'King Bee', 'Vegetable Man', 'Scream Thy Last Scream', 'Double-O Bo', 'I Get Stoned (Stoned Alone)', 'Reaction in G', 'Early Morning Henry', 'The Most Boring Song I've Ever Heard Bar 2' (later See Saw), 'In the Beechwood' (various working titles).      There is a ton of material that people would love to hear from Syd.  Just release it!!!  It's not like 'Madcap' is some great album, in the traditional sense.  Absolutely, I love that album, but you hear Syd's voice fall apart.  You hear pages turn.  You hear him lose his place.  It's certainly not some polished product, but I love that!  Honestly, I'd buy a CD if it was just Syd playing one chord for an hour, I'm that big of a fan, and I know there are many others like me out there. And to the powers that be, we can get these songs anyway, so don't make us resort to third-rate bootlegs!!!  Let Dave take all these loose tracks and spend a year or so cleaning them up, maybe overdubbing some new parts, and release them.  You know, Quiet Riot did that on their 'The Randy Rhoads Years' album and it is really nice to have as a fan.  Let our Crazy Diamond shine on!!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The decade spanning 1976 to 1985 established Rush as one of hard rock's premier acts, and the eight studio albums released during this period offer the finest songs of the band's catalog.  During that decade Rush was on an incredible roll, with every album offering top-notch songs.  Never before and certainly not since has the band matched the quality of songs like Limelight, Free Will, The Analog Kid, The Trees, and a half dozen other classics released during that period.<br /><br />It's not that the band suddenly started to suck around 1986, but they did abruptly lose two key assets: their songwriting gifts and, equally striking, Alex Lifeson's astonishing ability to compose memorable riffs.  I believe Rush's immense popularity is due primarily to Alex Lifeson; at his creative peak the guy was practically a machine -- nearly every guitar riff he came up with was brilliant, and these riffs formed the backbone of the best albums in Rush's catalog.<br /><br />I don't hold it against Lifeson that his masterful ability to compose energetic guitar riffs and solos seemed to evaporate after 1985, any more than I'd hold it against a 35-year-old who can no longer dunk a basketball.  It seems clear that being a first-rate hard rock guitarist is a young man's game.  And if you look at some of Lifeson's guitar-god peers, their gifts often eroded in a far more catastrophic manner than did Lifeson's.<br /><br />It's indeed probable that Lifeson's technical abilities only increased after 1985, as he became interested in complex wailing chords.  But any growth he made as an guitarist couldn't begin to offset the creative talent that was lost.  Compare the riffs and overall guitar sound of Freewill and The Trees to any Rush song that came after 1985 and it's instantly obvious that something vital had vanished.  Without Lifeson's trademark riffs and solos, never again would the band compose a classic on the order of Limelight.<br /><br />Many of us Rush fans have had a love-hate relationship with post-1985 Rush.  We faithfully buy their albums, yet consistently end up with an overall feeling of disappointment.  Rush's work ethic and talent is such that they are incapable of releasing a bad album.  But without the inspired guitar-driven song writing they once offered, the releases consistently pale when compared to their peak work.<br /><br />So when Rush released Snakes and Arrows I dutifully yet reluctantly picked up a copy the moment it became available, bracing myself for another album of exceptional craftsmanship yet one that would continue Rush's post-1985 tradition of being an overall letdown.  Although Neil Peart had written a lengthy essay (\\"The Game of Snakes and Arrows\\") claiming that the recording process had been the most satisfying the band had ever experienced, I was so used to disappointment that I refused to get my hopes up.<br /><br />After my first listen, I decided this album was worth my time to write a review.  But I wanted to make sure I did justice to this album.  I've since listened to Snakes and Arrows closely more than twenty times, and I'm not the least bit tired of it.  Everything about this album stands up to, and in fact demands, careful and repeated listens.<br /><br />The only negative comment I can make about this album is that even the best songs don't quite reach the songwriting heights of Rush's classic period.  But the band makes up for this deficit, bringing things to the table we've never before heard.  Most obvious is the gorgeous sound production.  Despite the fact that all three members of Rush are virtuoso musicians,  this is nevertheless a band that lives and dies based on its choice of producer.  Back during the Terry Brown era, Rush's production work was consistently excellent.  Since then, the band has had their ups and downs with different producers.  Vapor Trails, their previous studio release of original material, was simply butchered in production.  I've repeatedly tried to listen to Vapor Trails but I've never enjoyed the experience.  While some listeners regard Vapor Trails as a strong album, I consider it unlistenable.<br /><br />By contrast, Snakes and Arrows isn't just the best-sounding of Rush's albums, it's among the best-sounding hard rock albums ever released.  I can't overstate how highly I regard this album's production.  The textures are nuanced and gorgeous, and the attention to sonic detail throughout stands up to the production quality evident in albums by studio geniuses like the Basement Jaxx and Kruder and Dorfmeister.<br /><br />In Snakes and Arrows, we have an album that is meticulously crafted yet never comes across as sounding slick.  If I had the opportunity to tell the band one thing, it would be that they would be out of their minds to ever choose anyone other than Nick Raskulinecz to produce future studio albums.  In Snakes and Arrows, Raskulinecz' exquisite production instincts have restored Rush's musical relevance and given the band a new lease on life.  Listen closely to any other album in the Rush catalog, and I think you'll agree that none offers the gorgeous sonic qualities of Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />Even though the songs on this album aren't as strong as Rush's peak work, the overall listening experience this album offers is the band's finest yet.  Put on a pair of good headphones and you're transported to a world in many ways richer and more interesting than what you'll find in Hemispheres or Moving Pictures.<br /><br />For the first time in twenty years, Rush has released an album that stands shoulder-to-shoulder with their finest work.  As songwriters, these guys can no longer dunk a basketball, but their overall game has only improved.  After a twenty year drought, I hold Snakes and Arrows, without reservation, as being among the top four albums released by the band.

1582701709|1.0|This book is so trite. The author and her \\"experts\\" repeat themselves  and probably could've summarized the book in a short paper. It shouldn't take long since it is all so made up. While plausible that we can achieve a positive atitude through our thoughts I don't believe that (the author would say thats the problem) the universe is waiting to give things to whomever asks for them.<br /><br />I believe that this a universe with a loving God and free will and if you work hard and learn what you need to achieve what you want then you will get it. Not just because you thought about it enough but because you wanted it bad enough to do the work.<br /><br />This was a waste of time as a read and I would've stopped a couple of chapter into it if I weren't reading it for a discussion group.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If someone were to tell you that a new Beatles album was out and it was made partially for Cirque Du Soleil, you'd probably remember the 1978 Peter Frampton/Bee Gees travesty and scream in horror!  No worries here.  George Martin himself (and son) have taken over 30 Beatles songs (and an uncountable amount of true Beatles special effects) and made a masterpiece.  From the quiet, bird-chirping beginning of \\"Because\\" to the anthemic \\"All You Need Is Love\\", one is treated to a musical masterpiece.  No song is presented in its entirety nor is any song given short shrift.  Using original Beatles soundtracks and effects, each song is seamlessly sequenced into the next giving an almost psychedelic experience.  In fact, some of the special sound effects will make you feel as if you'd taken more than an aspirin.  The experience truly is one that anyone, even the most fanatical of Beatles fans, will appreciate.  That's just the regular CD!  If you play the DTS 5.1 DVD on a good system, your mind will be blown!  This is one of those musical experiences that you just cannot believe was made so well, so exquisitely, so amazingly.  It is the Beatles.
B000TGCR3I|2.0|Gorgeous production values.  Left of the middle character designs.  Fantastic music by Plaid.      Sadly, the plot of the movie quickly descends into the same metaphysical-pseudo-spiritual gobbledeegook that so many feature-length Japanese anime films pass off as high art storytelling.  The metaphors are contrived, sophomoric and paper thin.  Yet, Tekon kinkurîto hammers its \\"underlying\\" themes into over our skull again and again as if it were wielding Black's signature iron pipe.       The movie is not wholly un enjoyable- the story of a down on his luck yakuza, turned expectant father Kimura, is much more compelling than the tale of Black and White and the film's only redeeming quality story and character-wise.  Sadly, Kimura is ushered out a good half hour before this mess of a story ends.     I cannot recommend this one, not by a long shot.  I'm really surprised at the positive reactions to this film.  Visually, it is impressive.  I love the music as well.  The story is a complete miss.  Perhaps others just want the visual entertainment.  Maybe they have their \\"anime blinders\\" on.  I watch movies for story and this movie doesn't deliver a good one.  I'm not alone in this either.  Check out the review over at Anime News Network for a review by Justin Sevakis who feels almost exactly the same about the film as myself.     I stand by my review.  Your time is better spent elsewhere.  Take a pass on Tekkon Kinkreet.
1563894696|2.0|The Long Halloween is good but not great. It has atmosphere, and is a brisk, fun read, but it doesn't hold up to even casual scrutiny. First, I must confess that I have a strong dislike of story lines that run a parade of villains through the narrative. This story is a great example of why. The villains get short shrift, and their formidability is diminished to the point where they are usually dispatched within a page or two. Who are they? What makes them so important in Batman's rogues' gallery? All we get is the ubiquitous \\"pin-up\\" page and then we move on. He beats them as easily as he would a mugger. There is even one ridiculous point in which Joker, Two Face, Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, Solomon Grundy, Poison Ivy, and I think even the Penguin (but he doesn't say anything and hadn't been in the story at any other point before, while the others had), are all together in a room, facing him. The Batman (with a little help from Cat Woman) dispatches all of them in a page or two. How is it that these villains can be so diabolical and confound Batman for multiple issue story lines in other books and then be so easily beaten here? Also, the \\"twist ending\\" makes no sense whatsoever.   In fact, this whole story was told much more concisely only 5 or 6 years before this one, in the 1990 Batman Annual, by Andrew Helfer and Chris Sprouse. It's the same core story, focusing on the origin of Two Face. There's the trial of mob boss Morconi (complete with Batman in disguise in the gallery), the duplicitous assistant D.A. Fields, and Dent's troubled history with his father; however, it resonates far more effectively because of the manner in which it explores Harvey's psychological turmoil and because it never veers from that. By going for depth rather than breadth, the story packs more of a punch in 55 or so pages than The Long Halloween's 370, and since it doesn't go for pin-ups every other page, it takes about as long to read too.
B000SO7OLQ|4.0|A glance at the band photo on the back cover would lead one to assume this is just another in the over-filled pool of West Coast death metal bands. But, wait. The logo font looks mysteriously like that of Annihilator. The front cover artwork depicts one of the band members in '80's metal fashion, sporting mirrored sunglasses, a leather jacket, and a studded jean-vest over it, strangling what appear to be emo kids. Looks promising.    For thrashers who have spent the last 15+ years in the closet, listening to old Kreator, Exodus, Sodom, and early Slayer albums, it's time to come out. No more settling for releases from our aging heroes that lack the spark of earlier days, or the occasional good death metal or metalcore album just for something new to listen to. Amazing new thrash bands are appearing everywhere, it seems. Fueled By Fire is at the forefront of the onslaught of thrash albums released in the last year, right behind the new Municipal Waste.     The instrumental intro track is okay--the rhythm lifted from DRI's \\"4 of a Kind\\"--a primer for what's to come. The second track, appropriately titled Thrash is Back, is a mix between Kreator's Total Death and Metallica's Whiplash, with a Killers-era Iron Maiden-like guitar solo. Awesome. From there forward, with the exception of Betrayal--a thrash ballad that the album could totally have done without, this is a full-on jigga-jigga-jigga thrash assault; somewhere between early Kreator and the first two Maiden albums. The vocals even sound a bit like Paul Di'Anno, with the occasional hideous screams to boot!

I love the characters, especially Kvothe, and I find myself worrying about his ultimate welfare.  The scenery and events are fully alive and vivid to all my senses. I can nearly hear the name of the wind whispering in its pages. And, I can hardly wait for the second book (Day 2) which is due to come out next spring.
B000TXG3YA|4.0|THE BAND: John Dyer Baizley (vocals, guitars), Brian Blickle (guitars), Summer Welch (bass), Allen Blickle (drums & percussion). Origin - Savannah, GA.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 56 minutes... however the last untitled track is 11 minutes of silence followed by a 60 second garage jam. So in reality, there are 10 tracks coming in at 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing song titles/credits, musicians, and thank you's. Album cover artwork by front man John Dyer Baizley. Recorded at The Jam Room in Columbia, SC. Label - Relapse Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: A new album with an old familiar sound... like those garage days are being revisited. Heavy guitars and a loud bass dominate the melodies. The rumbling is raw and stripped down - no keyboards and sound effects. I've had this album for several weeks now and I can't help but hear elements of early BTO, Black Sabbath, Kyuss, Fireball Ministry, Isis, Black Stone Cherry, and Mastodon (though not as progressive and not as much vocal growling). Hard rock (borderline metal) with a southern rock flare. I'd also swear I heard some of Molly Hatchet's triple axe rhythm guitar licks too. First and foremost - the  band likes to jam. The intros to the songs are long - sometimes 2 or 3 minutes before the vocals enter. There are 4 instrumentals on this \\"Red Album\\" - the beautifully acoustic \\"Cockroach En Fleur\\", the trippy \\"Aleph\\", \\"Teeth Of A Cogwheel\\" (with an intro reminiscent of Steve Miller's \\"Swingtown\\"), and the slow chugging \\"Grad\\". What first hooked me into the album was the opener \\"Rays On The Pinion\\" - a cool intro - nice rocking jam that gets heavier as the song progresses. Another highlight is \\"Isak\\" - some heavy bass along with some great drumming and hi-hat work. After many spins though, my favorite track here is \\"Wailing Wintry Wind\\", with its long 4 minute long psychedelic intro and great rhythm guitars and drums. As much as I like the music, there are a few flaws that I keep coming back to: Baizley's vocals - reminded me of a young CF Turner (BTO) or even Paul Di'Anno (Iron Maiden) - raw, gruff, throaty... and extremely limited in range; all the vocals arrangements sounded the same or even interchangeable. The lyrics - call it deep or esoteric; call it emotional and poetic; call it whatever you want - I simply can't get into the lyrics enough to find myself singing along. The untitled bonus (track 11) is a waste. In the end, I've found that I bought this album for the music (and simply tolerate the vocals). And, no... it's not a chick band (the name \\"Baroness\\" usually refering to a wife/widow of a Baron). Overall this is a solid release. The \\"Red Album\\" is a welcomed change of pace in the world of hard rock albums being released after the millennium - even if it is a throwback of sorts (4 stars).that I keep coming back to: Baizley's vocals - reminded me of a young CF Turner (BTO) or even Paul Di'Anno (Iron Maiden) - raw, gruff, throaty... and extremely limited in range; all the vocals arrangements sounded the same or even interchangeable.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly not only pulls a five star rating on Amazon but it is consistently listed on top 10 lists of the best sci-fi shows ever. Usually in the top 5. tv.com has given it the No.1 spot on their list and that spot was not undeserved. Every show will have its naysayers and Firefly is no exception. When it comes to sci-fi I feel that Firefly is easily one of, if not the best, show I have ever watched. Some of my favorite shows include Stargate SG-1, Atlantis, Star Trek The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise, Lost, Supernatural, X-Files, and The 4400 so I do appreciate quality. For those that hype Joss Whedon as having failed on Firefly by contrasting the show to Buffy and Angel I say \\"C'mon!\\". Buffy and Angel were crap unless you were a pre-pubescent teen. It was kiddy crap then and would be today. And simply because it had a successful run means nothing. The U.S. is a nation of shallow inarticulate boobs. We live in a country where \\"American Idol\\" and \\"Americas Next Top Model\\" are top rated shows which says a lot for our culture. If you like sci-fi I recommend \\"Firefly\\". The only negative thing about purchasing this box set is that when you complete it there is no season two to continue onto. You are left with desires for more and the only thing there is to suffice those desires is Serenity. This show cancellation was a loss to television and the sci-fi community. I would love to see a network bring it back and pick up where season 1 left off..
B0002YCVXI|5.0|We love Yo-Yo Ma at our house.  This CD is one of the best!  What is surprising is that our golden retriever also prefers this one over any other music.  You can tell because she comes into the living room and lies down next to the entertainment center when we are playing this music.

037571457X|4.0|An autobiographical account of a girl growing up in Iran. Through her own story she highlights how deeply screwed up the country is, and has become, and how ludicrous some of the religious laws and commands are, when you see them through the eyes of a child. Wear something on your head? It is too hot, stupid! That sort of thing.    She is not holding back, talking about how people feel when their 18 year old next door neighbour is executed as being a communist, after a leftist lead revolution allows them to take power, or when your uncle's sister is strangled to death because he was not home to kill, and things like that.    She points out other crazy things that we probably are not aware of, you can't have chess sets, in Persia? That is very freaky.    The art style is quite cartoony, which is somewhat jarring when she is talking about firing squads.    Definitely good.

The standout tracks, in my opinion, are:  Aerodynamic  Digital Love  Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger  Face To Face    That being said, I think all the songs are great. The ones listed above are probably the most accessible, though. If you're into electronic songs that you can dance to, and can blast in your car, this album is DEFINITELY for you!
1563894696|4.0|This series is one big long mystery, at the heart, as the cops and Batman have to work, alongside the mob at times to work out who the hell the Holiday killer is, if they can, that is.    This is one that is not easy to guess, and is handled very nicely. Definitely a Bat-story to check out, and most people could probably handle it.
0316067598|5.0|A breath of fresh air. It's about time we heard a great story about our men and women who are serving in our armed forces and so current. Thank you Marcus for such an inspiring book.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I love this CD.  I never heard of Celtic Woman before, then one night I woke up and saw this CD on a commercial.  At the time, I was looking for songs to use in my wedding, and (half-asleep) I saw one of the songs we were going to use - \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"  After the commercial went off, I went back to sleep and did a search for the CD the next day.  After hearing the samples, I bought the disc.  All I can say is, we didn't use Josh Groban's version of the song.  Their version is so beautiful, and the voices are so pure.  Once my fiance heard it, he was hooked.  The other songs on the disc are also very enjoyable and relaxing.  It is definitely worth the money spent on it.  I'm so glad that I just happened to see the commercial when I did.  Otherwise, I may have not known about this amazing group of women.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I actually pre-ordered this HD DVD Collection when I had ordered my HD-DVD Player. Great series on TV, and even better on demand (owning it.) I would strongly recommend this HD DVD Collection. Remember, the BBC version has the guy and the US version has the lady. I went with the guy because he wasn't annoying like the lady and it sounded much better.
B000005J56|5.0|A while back I saw a preview of the making of the Buena Vista Social Club and at the time, it seemed like an interesting independent film topic. Not long after that I was in a bootleg CD store in Macedonia and I saw a copy of this album (CD) and was instantly intrigued; something about the cover struck me, so I bought it. What a pleasant surprise, and although I don't understand Spanish, I did feel the rich sense of emotion seeping through the sounds of this work. Vibrant; yet aged, this album reaches something deep that cannot be adequately explained. Buena Vista Social Club is a real treat.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm usually not one to buy bootleg copies of anything, it's a personal form of silent protest and my way of supporting the artist; consequently, I scrapped the bootleg version and bought the real thing.
B00005R24K|5.0|The one that started the trilogy off. I feel it is impossible to truly appreciate the other two without first knowing this one, to see how far the story evolved, as well as quality of film making. Bruce Campbell is as awesome as usual and the movie is hilarious. Everyone should see this movie. Everyone should own this movie.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|As long as you are not squemish about blood and can appreciate irony you are in for a treat.  Let's face it TV has become increasingly better than the movies coming out and this show certainly proves that point.  Micheal C Hall proabably better know for his role on Six feet under has found another fantastic show and I have certainly fallen in love with his character and you will too.  Enjoy the show!
0783227434|5.0|The last of the trilogy and some argue the best. There was a big name behind it and more of a budget to play with then the first two. Hilarious one liners and animation. A must see for all cheesy horror fans and comedy fans. Bruce Campbell is....well, Bruce Campbell.
B00005JMYI|5.0|In the 1970's, the television news scene was a man's world, and the local news anchor was king! In San Diego, that king was Ron Burgundy, a ladies' man, man's man, man about town. Ron loved his city, and his city loved him. This all changed when the first female anchor came onto the scene. When Ron met Veronica Corningstone, it was love at first sight, but his male-chauvinist, co-worker pals, Champ Kind of Sports, on-the-scene reporter Brian Fantana, and mentally challenged weatherman Brick, weren't ready to give up their friend, or their newsroom, without a fight. When Ron and Veronica's fledgling relationship suddenly goes sour as a result of her promotion to a lead anchor, the boys are happy again to have Ron back as their leader, until Veronica exacts her revenge and turns the entire city against him!<br /><br />While his best film thus far would have to be the charming, stylish, instant Christmas classic \\"Elf,\\" \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" may always be considered the quintessential Will Ferrell comedy. Hilariously silly 99.9% of the time and recapturing the tackiness of the '70s throughout, if you love comedy and Will Ferrell, this film is a must have. The ensemble cast features some of the best comedic actors of the 21st century in both major and minor roles, from Steve Carell as Brick Tamland to Fred Willard as newsroom chief Ed Harkin; from Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone to Jack Black as a very angry biker! The humor is random and unpredictable, the performances are spot on, the \\"Afternoon Delight\\" scene is unforgettably funny, and yes, there's a story too. Good stuff all around!<br /><br />The Unrated, Widescreen DVD doesn't disappoint much in the extras department either. Granted, the DVD commentary is mostly a waste of time. It's basically just Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay cracking wise about everything BUT the movie, which they hardly even talk about, along with some other cast members (a few simply call in) and some completely unrelated guests. The commentary is wacky, but while I usually love Will Ferrell's comedic antics, it's mostly not as funny as it tries to be. There's a ton of other stuff too though. We get a Ron Burgundy interview with Rebecca Romijn Stamos from MTV, a wealth of deleted scenes and outtakes, a hilarious \\"Afternoon Delight\\" music video, an interview with Ron, a making-of featurette, an ESPN audition, and a ton of text bios and production notes! My only regret is not getting the release packed with \\"Wake Up, Ron Burgundy,\\" which is supposedly like having an entire second Ron Burgundy movie to enjoy!d guests.

B000001AKN|5.0|What can I say?  It's the greatest hits of Lionel Richie.  If you are a Richie fan, then you should own this.  I bought it on cassette.  Now, I need to upgrade and get this on CD.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|The 5.1 surround sound mix version of the albums are amazing, never mind the extras!
B000RG1FMO|4.0|This is a great album.  You can really tell he doesn't make music just to make money but because he really has a talent and vision for it.      This album doesn't need defending it's stand quite well on it own.  You won't regret spending your money on this.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|This album is the best thing since toasted subs, it's the bomb digadedy so buy it.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|This movie comes with great extras, interviews with the director, philosophers, futurist, and great behind scenes info.    The movie itself stands on its own and the less you know about it before watching it the better.  The amount of style that oozes off this film is insane, it really reminds people what a film as art really is.  The only down side to this dvd is that it is a dvd and not a blu-ray disc.  Although there is a hd-dvd version my only hope is that a blu-ray version is also released so I can add that to my high definition collection.
B000002H4C|3.0|With the Iggles making tarts out of themselves on their (giggle) \\"farewell tour,\\" and despite the efforts of the brilliant Steuart Smith, Don is very conspicuous by his absense.  And his song \\"Heavy Metal (Takin' A Ride)\\" on this...thing just proves that hypothesis.  Still: great album (then), great talent, but as for real \\"heavy metal,\\" there just ain't that much on here.  (Which is OK, too...) \\"Why,\\" you indignantly ask? \\"Journey's\\" about as \\"metal\\" as were the Bay City Rollers.
075640407X|5.0|There are times in this book you will not be able to put it down. The writing is stimulating and the humor never fails to envoke a chuckle.
0743298020|5.0|It has been awhile since a book captured my attention as vividly as this one did. It also has been awhile since I've read something and couldn't figure out the ending completely. Also, this book was written so vividly and lyrically about a bookworm's deep and enduring love for the written word. Those first few chapters are quotable for serious book lovers if you know what I mean ~~ if not, you'll have to pick up the book to read it for yourself to know what I mean.     This is not a hurriedly written novel. There is no sense of hurry in these pages. Not once did I feel like I need to read ahead just to get to the suspense ~~ no. This book is meant to be savored and enjoyed. There is a beauty among this author's written word that you don't find often these days. Not only is there beauty among the written word, you will find that she creates a different world from your every day reality ~~ a beautiful if haunting world. A world filled with secrets and fairy tales. A world filled with pain, love, redemption and seeking the truth. It is not a novel filled with moral lessons for the reader to gleam ~~ I didn't get that feeling at all ~~ it is a novel meant to be entertaining and written like the older classics, but with a twist.     Margaret Lea is a young woman with a secret of her own, has been asked to write Vida Winter's biography. Margaret Lea is a woman with a deep passion for the written word and she would have never read Vida Winter's novels as she didn't care for the modern novels. Vida Winter is a reknowned writer in all of England and perhaps all of the world as her novels have been successful in just about everywhere. Margaret takes on the job after an intriguing letter appeared in her mailbox. That is just the beginning.     If you like Victoria Holt or Phyllis Whitney gothic romance novels, you will love this book. If you like gothic or romantic novels or Jane Austen, or the Bronte Sisters' novels, you will definitely enjoy this book. It is so different from other books being written today ~~ and I am definitely looking forward to reading more of this author's books.    9-24-07
075640407X|5.0|Lets just say this, there are this many good reviews on here for a reason. This is the first review I have ever posted, strange since I buy EVERYTHING off of Amazon, but credit where credit is do. Just read it and you will have no question as to what the fuss is about.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Friends is awesome!!!!!    This edition of the best serie ever is really amazing. The presentation is great and very special. Of course this is a must for every friends fan. Don´t think about it, it worth it every dollar. Highly recommended!!!!!!
6305428050|5.0|This is my favorite movie from childhood!  My girlfriend and I can watch it for hours and reminisce on the 80's & early 90's
0316067598|5.0|This inspiring story cuts right to the quick about the restrictions we put on these heroic men who fight to keep us free.    This is a story of four truly patriotic and resolute men sent into battle with not only an enemy armed with rifles, explosives and knives, but also forced to do battle with the very bureaucrats who sent them and the national press.    Highly recommended to anyone who wants to know what we are fighting against and why it is so difficult to win.
B000HZD08M|5.0|Frin beginning til end I was hooked on this flick. You will enjoy this, even if you are not a big sci-fi fan. It is one of those movies that you don't want to end. Loved it!!!
0783230079|5.0|I thought this movie was very touching. It's nice to see a movie that is good for the whole family to see. One in which there is a moral to the story! Enjoyed all the characters and the roles they played. A movie everyone should see at least once.
B000UD08HC|5.0|I think this is an excellent video, great for Pink Floyd and David Gilmour fans alike.  It is well worth the price.  The sound and the video are excellent!  The behind the scenes touring sections are also cool to have.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Loved both films tremendously.  I don't know anyone who couldn't relate to all or parts of this film and its characters.  It was extremely moving. However, I am eagerly waiting to know the outcome of the 2nd encounter.  Obviously, he stays...but for how long??  Something to note, also.  In Before Sunrise several topics they discussed actually came to pass in Before Sunset.  Loved seeing how they had both matured but that chemistry was still there.  They are great together.      If you're listening, Ethan and Julie...let's see a 3rd and maybe 4th and 5th installments of this wonderful journey.  Let's follow them to the \\"sunset\\" of their lives.
076790592X|5.0|This book was quick to read and has a powerful message.  Should be on everyone's 'must read' list!
0066620996|5.0|If I have a bible for business, this is it.  First who then what is the only way to go!
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus is a brilliant Halloween tale about three witches and how they are 're-awakened' by some meddling kids.  Upon awakening, the three witches, who are sisters, instantly set about reliving their lives and causing plenty of trouble for the kids and the rest of the town in a 'bewitching' and uproarious manner. This movie is both funny and a little scary at the same time.  It definitely gets a two-thumbs up!
1891252089|5.0|I bought this book to be used in conjunction with David Swenson's Short Forms DVD and the Primary Series DVD (which I haven't advanced to yet). It's a great handy book to have--it shows lots of alternative postures and gives details about where to look (the \\"drishti\\") during postures, and some interesting background information about Ashtanga yoga. I also really like that he has a section in the back of the book where he shows all the routines (15-min, 30-min, 45-min, primary series, etc.) in a condensed, handy picture format (on 1-2 pages) so you can eventually learn to practice on your own, without relying on the DVD. Overall, David Swenson's products are the best!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Great CD.  I love this girl's voice immediately after hearing it for the first time on SNL.  She is a rare breed cross between Norah Jones, Billie Holiday, and another that escapes my memory.  She is going to go a long way.  John P. Hayden
B000SNUMC0|4.0|Let me just preface this by saying that if you're a close-minded Barlow nostalgic, this album will not appeal to you. Ripper and Barlow are both fantastic in their own right, but you need to get over it...Barlow's never coming back. (EDIT: Since I wrote this review, Barlow has rejoined the band...hm, how about that.)    Being that this is a concept album, you at least need to have a little bit of interest in the storyline to fully appreciate this album. This is not a concept album like \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", where each song stands on it's own and the lyrics do all of the story telling. This album has several short interludes, that on their own may be seen as distracting, but work to perfection within the context of the story. All that aside, though - the songs here are killer.    Everything you tend to look for in an Iced Earth album is here. That epic, grandiose feel in the chorusus, the galloping rhythms, the soaring vocals, and the blazing solos are still very much intact. Though some would disagree, I think Ripper Owens brings this band to a whole new level. He has a much different vocal style and incredible range, and he gives Schaffer a lot more freedom when writing melodies.     The standout tracks here include \\"Something Wicked Part 1.\\" - a quick, scorching riff leads into one of the previously mentioned galloping rhythms, with Ripper Owens extremely emotive vocals soaring above it all. \\"A Charge To Keep\\" starts out with a chugging guitar riff, which eventually leads into an epic chorus with a multi-layered choir, truly the most epic song on the album. And \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\" is just Iced Earth at their finest. An ear-bleed inducing scream by Ripper in the beginning, leading into an upbeat thrashy tempo with yet another multi-layered, epic chorus.     Those are only a few of the standouts, though - this album is solid from top to bottom. Whether you're a new fan of Iced Earth, or an old (open-minded) fan, you would do well to give this alisten.

B000002JSP|4.0|Zep's prophetically titled \\"In Through the Out Door\\" proved to be their last studio album.  Recorded in Abba's Polar Studios, it was also their most commercial and listenable album to date.  Much of this had to do with John Paul Jones' lush keyboard arrangements.  Those expecting Jimmy Page to be smoking on guitar will instead be greeted by a more sparse and spartan style carried over from \\"Presence.\\" Still, Page emits the blues in tracks like \\"All My Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl.\\"  There are no wasted notes here.<br /><br />\\"In the Evening\\" - the last Zep anthem - is still a crowd favourite.  And \\"Carouselambra\\" reflects Zeppelin's spirit of adventure, reminding one of the Immigrant Song in its stride.<br /><br />Critics are divided over Zep's foray into country with hoedown songs like \\"Hot Dog\\" - very much a fun throwaway - it showcases the relief Zep was headed for, and perhaps to toss off their old darker image.  This album was very much Zep in experimentation mode, trying to find a new sound, and as some point out - to avoid becoming dinosaurs (Plant would actually coach the audience to say the word \\"dinosaur\\" in Zep's 1980 concerts).<br /><br />In all, ITTOD feels like a Brave New World for Zep.  Plant's voice, although diminished from his younger days - gives emotive and exemplary vocals in \\"All My Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Crawl.\\"  \\"Fool in the Rain\\" remains a favourite and should be performed in their reunion (note: Plant jammed this with Pearl Jam in a live show).<br /><br />***POSTSCRIPT: Three other tracks from the sessions were left off the album and later released posthumously on CODA.  The range of tracks - \\"Wearing and Tearing\\";\\"Ozone Baby\\" and \\"Darlene\\" again highlighted Zep's attempt to expand their already considerable oeuvre with punk, rockabilly nuances.  I'm not sure if the tracks fit into the order here, but putting them on a re-released album would be interesting, if making CODA somewhat irrelevant.<br /><br />ITTOD isn't a bad album at all.  It just suffers in the shadows of its mighty predecessors.  Taken on its own terms, it is as distinctive as Zep gets.redecessors.  Taken on its own terms, it is as distinctive as Zep gets.
B000RJO578|1.0|We could only get through the first twenty minutes of this movie and then we shut it off. Thank goodness I rented it for free from the public library. It was very slow and not funny at all.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|For Niel Young fans - this is a must - when all the great songs were new - and now here perfectly re-mastered.
1591396190|5.0|1. This is NOT a marketing book  2. There is no such thing as a fail safe strategy  3. This is a tool and is only as good as the user   4. Applicable in different situations  5. Good companion to Competitive Strategy written in the 80's by Mike Porter which is THE industry book  6. The book is NOT a pioneer and is NOT proported to be.  It is a study in those companies who seemed to have created new markets such as Cirque De Soleil.  The authors did NOT set out to create a new \\"theory\\" and then retroactively \\"fit\\" companies but rather study an emerging pheonom. and try to locate patterns.    I think that pretty much covers all the gripes of the previous entries.  I first came across this book in a competitive strategy class in a business organizational change degree.  It is an excellent text and gives another viewpoint to the old study of competitive strategy.  I have used the strategy canvas tool located in chapter two AS A TOOL to assist me in both departmental and industry situations to locate existing patterns of competition.    Worth the money.  But then, I am just a \\"mere\\" academic (albeit with many years of industry experience) so if you truly do not like the book I suggest returning it. :)
B0007OASII|5.0|Take Geoff Tate vocals and Jordan Rudess keyboards, Paul O'Neill and Jon Olivia symphonic operatic songwriting, add great bass and drums, and you get Kamelot.  There are some songs that sound like Queensryche on steroids. But the queensryche similiarities end with the vocalist. It is very unique. There are splashes of Dream Theater, Queensryche, Shadow gallery, Savatage/trans-siberian. All good company to be in. If you like one of those bands, you should find something to like in this album. There are so many elements to the songs, from 4/4 crunchy guitars to pianos, violins, etc. On track 6 - Abandoned, I wish they continued the chorus and do a soulfull lead guitar, instead of just ending after the build-up. They definetely need to re-do that.  Listed by tracks are my remarks:    1- 5 stars, probably my favorite  2- 5 stars, splashes of Dream theater  3- 5 stars, Killer bass and bass drum groove  4- 5 stars, Great lyrics  5- filler  6- piano, great Build, but then suddenly ends. 5 stars  7- 5 stars, thunderstorm - jams  8- 5 stars, Most Queensryche sounding song.  9- filler  10- 4 stars, Dream Theater sounding, has strong lead guitar.  11- 4 stars, catchy chorus  12- 5 stars, epic song. again killer bass and drums passages.  13- filler  14- 4 stars.
0792163710|5.0|\\"Shane\\" is deservedly known as one of the great Westerns.<br /><br />\\"Shane\\" is the story of a gunfighter who comes to the aid of a family of settlers who are being persecuted by free-rangers. There a many allusions to Christ in the character of Shane - his sensitivity, his serenity, his humbleness,  his restraint, his self-sacrifice, even the fact he is only ever referred to by one name.<br /><br />Shane is perfectly played by Alan Ladd matched by Brandon de Wilde as the young boy Joey who idolizes Shane, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister as the \\"bad guy\\".<br /><br />\\"Shane\\" is superbly staged and shot with great use of foreground and background shot compositions particularly in the bar-room sequences - and who can forget the final sequence. This film more that any other mythologizes the Western. A stunning achievement by director George Stevens.
B000005RHR|4.0|I've owned this Aphex Twin album for many years and find it a great way to overview Richard D. James and his early development. He would go on to much more experimental stuff in the years after the early 1990s but this album is a great jumping on place for people who need an easier place to start before getting into his later electronic/ambient experimentalism.    First thing you'll notice is that this album is not as ambient as advertised. You're not getting the kind of background sonic wallpaper that you find with Brian Eno. The tracks here are much more involved and up tempo with a mostly firm beat. It's an honest electronic score with even more techno parallels than usual. That's not a bad thing of course. There is much gorgeous melodic content to be found here and can be used as an outstanding album for relaxation and contemplation. Seriously, this is no masterpiece but it should not be out of print and hopefully finds it's way back onto the market soon.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This strobe is marketed and intended as a small, portable, light, unobtrusive alternative to the larger SB-600/800 strobes.  It does NOT fill the bill as a full time powerful strobe.  It DOES however do what it should; provide much nicer light (when bounced) than built in strobes, MUCH nicer.  Absolutely a must for candid snapshot photography.  Highly recommended!
0895260131|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. Does not provide much insight, but makes you want to learn more.
0670858048|5.0|Thank you Amazon for the book, 'Zoom'. I bought 2 copies 2 years ago and recently 2 more from you, for my little friends and some big friends too. It has brought magic and a sense of wonder to all that look at it - and all done without any words! Brilliant.
0345494997|5.0|This is a very captivating tale about a love affair with an extremely prominent architect and his lover and is told in a private way. It seemed that I was reading Maymah's journal and that I maybe shouldn't be reading it! I don't know when truth and fiction overlapped but it was not important to me.The challenges they faced alone and together were presented in a believeable way. I wanted to know more or what followed this novel.It would be a great book club selection because it raises sensitive issues that adults of all ages regard as moral dilemas and can lead into a very controversial discussions.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|Amazing, that's all that needs to be said about this soundtrack.  If anyone has ever been a Nikki Sixx fan you will enjoy the music, great work, great sound, just amazing!
B000024D4R|5.0|At first I couldn't understand the whole concept of \\"Animals\\".  But then I was like \\"Ok, this one pretty much has Roger Waters' name all over it so of course there's a whole 'nother meaning behind the songs and the overall content\\".  The songs are pretty long but pretty interesting.  For quite some time, I had this cd playing non-stop in my stereo.  All my friends (who were also Pink Floyd fans) were like \\"why this one\\"?  Why not \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"The Wall\\"?  I just told them to give this a chance and they all ended up lovin' it.  Give it a listen and see what I mean.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|We all know this is the best horror series anywhere on TV or movies, but this season is finally available in 5.1 surround.  The sound is really well mixed and adds to the atmosphere!<br /><br />Way to go!!!
B000002U8G|5.0|This album is in the \\"Top 5\\" of my favorite Pink Floyd albums.  Whilst everyone is hooked on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", this one is even better (but that's just me).  It starts off just right with \\"One of These Days\\" and concludes with the 23 1/2 minute long \\"Echoes\\".  An old English teacher gave me an old BBC bootleg tape of theirs from back in 71' and it had \\"rough-take\\" early versions of the 2 songs mentioned and I was like \\"Yeah I definitely need this one\\"!  I bought the album a few hours later and loved every song!  If you're a \\"Floyd\\" fan, pick one up and enjoy!
B0000UJDLM|1.0|The DVD did not work. It skipped so much that it was unwatchable and I returned it.
B000002C1W|5.0|I've heard too much smack on how PF didn't sound good or couldn't make it w/out Roger Waters.  That's all hogwash to me.  I got this one and in my honest opinion, the band still had it and as strong as ever.  Even David Gilmour's writing was dead on and had serious meaning behind it.  Ok the songs maybe sound more modern for the year it was released but they sounded just as good (maybe even their best) in years!  This one had meaning unlike the more popular (and I don't know why) \\"The Wall\\" or \\"The Final Cut\\".  Even more so, Roger took the remaining members to court for continuing with the name Pink Floyd.  Nick Mason and David Gilmour won the case and made another damn good album!  If you like Roger Waters, just pass this one up and get one of his solo albums instead and take some valium along with that garbage.  Check this one out, it's worth a good listen.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|First, I did not had any compression errors on that discs as others told, neither on my harman kardon DVD player nor on my computer.    This DVD set with 9 discs is great, with all important versions, theatrical release and directors cut. There is really nothing else to wish for. Its the first time I saw part 3 and 4 and I must say I did really not miss anything. Part 3 and 4 in my opinion can be shreddered, they do nothing but harm the vision about Gigers alien.    Regarding part 3 I agree with the people who say if David Fincher would have had so much artistic liberty and time as they had on the 4. part he would have delivered a good 3th part. So, its not his fault.     The 4th part is really nothing. There should never have been a 4th part.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album will definitely set the mood for one!  All in all, it's a great album to mellow out to!  This studio piece also welcomed back Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals (his first time singing with PF since \\"Dark Side\\").  My favorite song on here (call me crazy) is \\"Marooned\\".  Rick's keyboard lines are relaxing and David's guitar licks do the same, and are also quite hypnotic.  This one almost has the vibes of \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", but with more of a modern feel as well.  Check it out.
B000J103YI|5.0|I still have this disc in constant rotation and truly only skip one song, CADILLAC CAR. But let me rhapsodize for one moment about the breakout star of this movie & soundtrack IMHO, Ms. Jennifer Hudson!  Every time I see or listen to her performance of I AM CHANGING, I swear the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and I tear up.  Her version of AND I AM TELLING YOU was good but in my opinion, Jennifer Holliday's version was superior just for the sheer gut-wrenching quality & desperation in her performance.  J-HUD'S version of ONE NIGHT ONLY is soulful and beautiful as is the \\"why wasn't this a hit single?\\", LOVE YOU I DO & MOVE (both get my feet tapping every time I hear them).<br /><br />This cd is a faithful run-down of the songs as performed in the movie so everytime I listen to it at work, I imagine the scenes and get this big goofy smile on my face because I enjoyed it so much.  In addition to the previously mentioned tracks, my faves are:<br /><br />FAKE YOUR WAY TO THE TOP - Eddie channels all the great r&b/soul singers on this toe-tapping track<br /><br />STEPPIN TO THE BAD SIDE - my fave part is actually the end as \\"Thunder & The Dreamettes\\" take over<br /><br />I WANT YOU - Eddie sounds great on this track!!<br /><br />DREAMGIRLS - Beyonce does her thing on this one and perfectly channeled Diana Ross during the movie performance<br /><br />IT'S ALL OVER - I have to stop myself from reciting this track out loud, it's angry & funny at the same time<br /><br />HARD TO SAY GOODBYE -  beautiful track<br /><br />DREAMGIRLS (finale) - J-HUD brings the drama & soul to this brief track<br /><br />For those who enjoyed the movie & the music, I'd highly recommend getting this disc.  Also to those who want to whett their appetite till J-Hud's debut album is released, this is a great way to introduce yourself to this powerful new vocalist.
B00005JNX0|1.0|This is by far one of the most obnoxious kids films to come out in some time.  The story is moronic, the animation uninspired, and the cast is bored.  Everything that shrek was, this is not.  The penguins are mildly entertaining, yes, but that is only a small part of this admittedly short film.  In the end it feels rushed, and lazily put together.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This truly is one of the best made-for-TV series ever shown.  For WWII buffs and military historians of all stripes, watch it - you will not be disappointed.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|[[ASIN:B000LAZDQA Shortbus (Unrated Edition)]]    Shocking, funny and very moving:    If you can't identify with some character in the film then you must be dead.  Yes not a film for everyone, but if you can move pass the shock of the nudity and sex to see what's beyond, you too will love this film.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Simply an excellent document of a memorable recording session. Bernstein shows all his emotions, Kiri Te Kanaka sings beatifully, it's interesting to watch a young Jose Carrera with all his vocal power. I enjoyed this session on cable TV first and duplicated my joy watching it on this DVD. A must for any West Side Story music. Excellent!.
B0009PVZWI|3.0|I'm only reviewing the DVD sides.    Disc 1 is the normal album in Enhanced Stereo which basically just means that Sony BMG didn't want one of their signature albums to be released in a rival format to SACD.  The Enhanced Stereo is just 2.0 48/16 which is technically a barely noticeable difference from 44.1/16 which is the standard Red Book spec.  I suspect it is possible that the Enhanced Stereo mix may have less dynamic range compression, but I would have to look at the waveforms to confirm this (don't want to go through the trouble).    Disc 2 on the other hand is the acoustic album in full DVD-A MLP 96/24 5.1.  This disc is excellent and makes the whole deluxe set worth purchasing if you have a DVD-A player.    With all the technical stuff aside this is a great album.  I would give the CD of this album 5 stars, but this is a special edition and I feel that it should be rated on those merits.    Definitely a must buy if you like the Foo Fighters.
0374105235|4.0|This book was quite moving and I feel strongly that anyone who reads it will be forced to examine many of their own convictions about war and violence. Beah's childhood dissapeared isntantly when his village was attacked by rebel forces while he and his friends were away for a talent contest. He never saw his family again or knew what happened to them. Pretty soon the only way that these boys can survive is by becoming soldiers themselves because the leader of the village they had finally found safey in will not ration food to anyone who doesn't fight against the rebels. When UNICEF steps in the boys have difficulty assimilating back to a life where survival and vengence are not necessary. The staff that works with them keeps telling the boys \\"It is OK, it is not your fault\\" because frankly, it isn't. And that right there is what makes Beah a truley remarkable being - he was able to accept that what he experienced was not his fault and he was able to forgive (himself included) and build a new life for himself. Most importantly, he was able to use what he experienced in attempt to help others come to the same place as himself.<br />While I was in the course of reading this book (I sit outside a coffee shop on a sidewalk picnic table) many people asked me about it because they had seen Beah on The Daily Show with Job Stewart. Some would say, \\"Oh, that is that guy's book, how is it?\\" It is hard, seriously. This was my second time with the book. The first time I stopped reading it because I was fixating on the violence and I think that I was wanting to deny that any of this could really happen. I didn't want to read about this stuff, but this book is both important and real. My father suffers from PTSD from the Vietnam war and all he won't talk about his experiences - instead he tells me \\"just feel lucky.\\" I am willing to embrace that luck and hope it continues, but I don't want to be niave either. War happens and Beah is brave enough to talk about it.

0374105235|5.0|The long and the short of things is that this book is phenomonal.  Incredible.  Horrifying.  Beautiful.  It's written in a very straightforward manner; its rather simple and in most places lacks any type of real depth.  However, the story that those words are telling is one that I will never forget.<br /><br />The story is set in Sierra Leone in the early 1990's.  The author, Ishmael, is just a young boy of twelve when his village is attacked by rebel troops.  Ishmael finds himself orphaned and on the run in a war torn country.  It seems there are no real safe places to hide.  By the age of thirteen Ishmael is picked up by the government army.  Once a gentle young man, Beah finds himself becoming a killer.  Hopped up on marijuana, speed and a local mixture of cocaine and gunpowder, he carries his AK-47 with pride and becomes one of the deadly killers he has spent the past year running from.<br /><br />This book encompasses it all.  When we meet Ishmael he is living a normal childhood; fighting with his dad, hanging out with his friends.  We follow him through the jungles as he flees from town to town.  We're with him when he kills for the first time, when he tries drugs, when he slowly begins to lose his humanity and become a killing machine.<br /><br />Eventually Ishmael is removed from the war by UNICEF.  He is placed in a rehabilitation home with other young boy soldiers like himself.  We're with him as he experiences withdrawalls from the drugs, as he faces the things he has done, as he comes to terms with his guilt and sorrow, and as he finds himself on the run...yet again.<br /><br />It's a brutally honest and raw story.  In the more than fifty violent conflicts worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers.  These children are traumatized, addicted to drugs and turned into killers.  In today's world, children have become the soldiers of choice.  It's a sad truth, and its something that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should.  This book, is a first hand account, told by a former child soldier, and should be a mandatory read for everyone.<br /><br />Ishmael Beah is now 27 years old and resides in New York City.  His book is a huge contribution to the literary world.  Everyone needs to read it.  Be prepared to be horrified though, its not for the weak of heart.ount, told by a former child soldier, and should be a mandatory read for everyone.

B00000DR5I|4.0|This pioneering album of ambient electronic music was recorded in 1975. The music was recorded and played by Edgar Froese (mellotron, guitar, synth, organ, gong), Chris Franke (moog, other synth, gong, organs and piano) and Peter Baumann (pianos, organ, \\"arp\\" and voice).<br /><br />The dreamy music swirls and meanders through crests and troughs over various rhythmic textures, sometimes soaring, at other times bubbling, droning or fluttering. Some sections sound like symphonic passages and the music encompasses many moods, from light-hearted and cheerful to eerie to joyful and uplifting.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the later solo work of [[ASIN:B000007TWJ Peter Baumann]] which is more mainstream and accessible, sometimes even downright catchy. Other enduring German experimental music from the same era includes [[ASIN:B0009J8FEU Monster Movie]] by Can, [[ASIN:B000QJLRJ8 Movies]] by Holger Czukay and [[ASIN:B000F6ZP5E Br&uuml;der des Schattens - S&ouml;hne des Lichts]] by Popol Vuh. If you love this kind of atmospheric instrumental music, you'll definitely also want to explore the work of [[ASIN:B000003RGY Autechre]].
B000SZLSB2|4.0|Let me just say this- if people pick this album up and expect another You're Beautiful then don't bother buying it. James said he was taking a new direction with his sophmore and he certainly did from what I am hearing. All the Lost Souls is a more mellow and rather lovely collection of songs. The more you listen the more the songs grow on you and quite fast. Many I'm sure though will listen to it once, realize there is no song that sounds exactly like You're Beautiful and they'll go on and call it a sophmore failure. I totally disagree though- and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved Back to Bedlam.     All the Lost Souls actually has quite a number of strong songs I listen to repeatedly- including One of the Brightest Stars, I'll Take Everything, the two utterly gorgeous songs Same Mistake and Carry You Home, Give Me Some Love and one of the strongest songs on here- Annie. I Really Want You has to be one of his best songs he's ever made honestly as well. Shine On and I Can't Hear the Music were the last I really got into but now I even enjoy them. And 1973 is an excellent single.     Maybe I am just a big fan of James altogether, but I do highly recommend to at least give All the Lost Souls a chance. The album art I must say also is great.     4/5
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect with this album, but after listening to it today--I am most definitely feeling it!  Out of the 13 tracks, I like 8.  It seems like in every song he's trying to send a message to his audience.  His album gets a solid 4 stars from me.  Good life and Good Morning are my favorites!
B000002OX7|5.0|I've been listening to Who's Next for for 36 years. If I listened to it 100 times that first month (at least) then once a month after that(at least), that means I've listened to it over 500 times. It still sounds like it came out last week. This isn't the rantings of some \\"old hippie\\". I work with 20-somethings who name this as one of their favorite albums.   Universal and never sounding dated, the remastering keeps it fresh, vibrant a valid today. Who's Next is a true work of art that ushered rock and roll out of the cutesy poppy ditties of the 50's & 60's and made it clear that real and powerful statements could be made through the rock venue. Everyone has a different reasons to praise this icon of an album. For me it's the whole package. Daltry's soaring and subtle vocals, Townsend's songwriting, and Mad man Moon's unbelievably unique thunderstorm of drums playing off Entwistle's surging bass. If you listen carefully to each instrument - it's all rather quite sloppy - but as the sounds intertwine like a fine jazz band the whole of the picture comes together like a monument to rock. And it is.
1419550969|5.0|If you want a serious preparation, this book is the best in the market. I suggest you buy the Kaplan premier program first, do the practice tests and then feel the need for some advanced material and then look out for this one.    The key is, after going through the initial preparation material say, Kaplan's Premier program for around 2/3 weeks, you will feel that something more is required to take you towards the advanced stage that can give you a boost, an edge, some extra climb in the GMAT score. Then comes this book. It requires 2 weeks of rigorous preparation time. The verbal section of this book (more so for Critical Reasoning and Sentence Correction) is simply superb.    However, do not forget that the last 2 weeks of your preparation should be solely focussed with the OG and other OG supplements (e.g. Verbal OG etc).    If I would not have had this book, my score would have been 20-40 points lower than my actual 700.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins' rational frontal attack on religion stems especially from his understandably great frustration at \\"religious\\" attacks on the facts of evolution. I can understand why many who are only superficially acquainted with the concepts of biological evolution may find them counter-intuitive or wrong, and also why a scientist (or even educated lay reader who has taken the trouble to learn) is totally frustrated with the attacks on a mature science (superstition versus rationalism) that is an arena of so much active discovery and new understanding in our day, and dismayed at the efforts to ruin the scientific education of thousands of the young.  Dawkins cites the terrible toll throughout history of religious zealotry and finds little compensating good. The core of the book is his effort to demonstrate the irrationality of a belief in God. He also recounts how the United States was founded on \\"secular rationalism,\\" and explicitly not as a \\"Christian nation\\" as so many in America today seem to believe. Whether one agrees with Dawkins' final conclusions about God or not, this should almost be required reading in the United States of the early 21st century, as we seem to be entering a new age of religious zealotry at home and abroad. Christians, as well as Muslims or Jews, certainly need to examine their faith and, in particular, how it is manifest in relation to others. Dawkins argues persuasively that the moral zeitgeist does indeed move forward, but that it is not driven by religion.

055357342X|4.0|This is the third book in the Song of Fire and Ice series.  Many main characters are killed and new points of view are introduced.    What was best:  The plot had interesting twists and there was interesting character developments.  Jaime Lannister seemed to be a generic cad in the first book, somewhat more interesting in the 2nd book and full fledged in the 3rd.  Melisandre, the Red Sorceress, you wonder if she might be a flawed ally against the Undead of the beyond the Wall.  Jon Snow may have joined the Wildlings at the end of the second book and could be facing consequences from the likes of Alisdair Thorn and Janos Slint(sorry for the spelling I listened to the Audio book).  It is realistic in that the good and well intentioned make huge life costing blunders and the conniving coast by on looks and presentation.  There is no escapism in this.  The new King's Hand, Tywin Lannister, always does what is easy instead of right, and is none the worse.  Danyreus is gaining more followers and makes her initial conquests but is unable to consolidate her holdings.  Again this is a twist from fantasies.    What wasn't good:  Tyrion Lannister is one of my favorite characters.  He shines when he is using his considerable intelligence and rolling the dice, in a figurative sense.  However, in this book and in the others,  he is given abilities with the crossbow, battle axe, and sword.  Despite, having his aching legs and recent battle injuries, he wields these weapons with proficiency.    New points of view I'd like to see in future books: Sandor Clegain, Ser Jorra Mormont, Mira or Jojen Reed.    The book is a good long read and leaves enough unanswered questions to intrigue but not frustrate the reader.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmour is in truly fantastic form for this concert. I watched from start to finish the minute I got it out of the packaging! Great sound and picture and some good close-ups of David playing his various guitars like the master that only he can be. I absolutely loved Fat Old Sun, SOYCD with Crosby and Nash and Comfortably Numb with David Bowie. But Echoes topped it for me. That was stellar indeed! As far as OAI goes...I loved hearing and seeing it performed live in its entirety. When I first listened to the entire CD I thought it was good. Seeing it actually performed live really shed a different light on it. I consider it to be some of David's best solo work.     This is really a fantastic DVD. From the concert to the extras, it's a must for any Gilmour/Floyd fan.

B00005JPRZ|5.0|When I went into this movie, I knew nothing about it. I believe that this is the best way to see this particular movie. I sometimes prefer not to know, but I legitimately hadn't heard of this movie before it came out. I saw it under a recommendation of, \\"Hey, we saw this movie last night and it was very funny.\\" That was all it took.    There were very few recognizable faces, and only one actor whose name I knew. The story was ridiculous and heart-warming all wrapped up together. For a movie that featured neither the comedic styling of Mel Brooks nor many (if any) \\"inappropriate\\" jokes, I am not sure I have ever laughed that hard at a movie. Consider, if you will, that Death at a Funeral is like [[ASIN:B00049QLSC Meet the Parents (Widescreen Special Edition)]], but funnier...and intelligent.    If you need/want to know what the movie was about, I won't deprive you. But if you will head my recommendation, stop reading here and enjoy the movie.    The movie:  A son attempts what would be a routine funeral for his father, but for a few unforeseen factors. This seemingly prim and proper British family may just be as flawed and...well, normal as any other family. An unfamiliar face in the crowd tries to blackmail the family, a promising young man who is trying to marry into the family accidentally takes enough hallucinogenic drugs to kill a small animal, and everyone keeps asking why the son instead of his author-for-a-brother will provide the eulogy. Family and friends come together to mourn and pay their respects to a man that they all thought they knew. What happens could never have been expected.
B000TGJ8IU|2.0|I wish they would've had this to rent. The comments on here convinced me to buy it, that it was worth it. You guys praised the way the extra scenes \\"fleshed out the characters and story.\\" However, what you guys failed to mention was that the additional flesh wasn't all new scenes. There was more nudity in this extended version than I was comfortable with. Now I'm torn between recouping some of my losses by selling my copy of this product to a pawn shop, or throwing it in the trash. The latter would be the more ethical choice.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|When I was a teenager I read Into the Wild. The book has haunted me ever since. While I have yet to see the movie, I can say that the music is worthy of the story it serves to help tell.<br /><br />The story of Chris McCandless touches on something locked deep in the heart of almost every young American male that has ever lived. It is about the search for freedom, for the wild, for truth.<br /><br />The songs on this disc are echoes of those goals/thoughts.<br /><br />In a disc of strong songs, I find Rise to be my favorite. It is not the longest or most profound song here, but it reaches out. It calls us on.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder was a great choice, maybe the pefect choice, for this CD. He takes a step sideways from his usual Pearl Jam fare. He has made a GREAT CD.<br /><br />I give the Soundtrack for Into the Wild my highest recommendation.
B00005YJMX|5.0|An excellent release of my favorite Herzog film, in both its American, and German forms. Highly recommended for anyone interested in a beautiful, tragic, beautifully composed horror movie.
1594489505|5.0|This novel, is by far the best I have read in some time.  The author writes a brilliant narrative with rich, amazing detail.  I've never been to Kabul, but reading his descriptions, I felt like I was walking down the streets, myself.    The story weaves a heart-breaking tale of two women living in a turbulent society of war and change.  I think that the author did a great job in explaining the political backdrop for the novel.  This novel moves from Monarchy, to Republic, to Communism, to an Islamic state, to the Taliban, and then to post-Taliban Afghanistan.     Even though Laila emerges as the main character, I believe it is Mariam and her story that stays with the reader.  This novel is bitter-sweet, yet hopeful. So beautifully written, I highly recommend.  I will be reading The Kite Runner and any future novels from this author.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|OK, so this is a bunch of one-liners.  So what.  It's funny and well acted (for the parts they are asked to play).  If the writers can keep coming up with story lines that are well written then this show could be a hit.  I will give you that it could... become stale really fast if the one liners get old quickly.  It's a 30 minute sit-com and should be taken at that.  It's meant for laughs so just sit back and laugh (writers... you better keep it funny).
B00005JPFH|2.0|The first two movies were not what I would have expected from Hollywood, intelligent, well structured and with highly entertaining and fluent story telling, I watched them both twice.  Spiderman 3 is exactly what I expected from Hollywood, dumbed down, pretty faces, lazy scripting , popcorn special effects used purely to distract from the disjointed and incoherent plot.  Why do the characters simply accept the events around them however random and bizarre, i understand the base material, but this is positioned as an intelligent take on the comic. How poorly do the filmmakers think of their audience, when they expect the viewer will simply behave like the characters themselves and just go along with the mish mash presented to them. I even felt nauseated, maybe it was the amount of wine the movie caused me to drink or maybe it was because the best parts of the movie were simply replications of events from its predecessors, while the English news reporter was the clincher.  But while these films make record amounts of money at the box office, I can't wait for Spiderman 4, then 5 then 6.......
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I knew my love for Ryan Gosling, already wavering at the brink after a few less than spectacularl performances, was in deep trouble when he opened his mouth in the DA's office in FRACTURE and out poured this muddled up, molasses mouth Southern accent (I guess) filched in bits and pieces from Jude Law and Kevin Spacey in MIDNIGHT AT THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.  They never exactly explained why Willy Beauchamp has attained a 97 percent conviction rate with this unintelligble Goober stammer, but you know what, after a half an hour or so Ryan just stopped talking in his soup and started speaking English like any other Angeleno.  It's like his beginning to care about human values and other human beings brought on many changes, including adopting the standard \\"mid-American\\" speech patterns people on TV have.  By the end of the movie he could have become a newscaster, and my love for him had returned, full strength, like an entire bottle of Excedrin.  He's a fantastic actor and rabks right up there with his fellow new Mousekeeters of the period, Justin, Christina and Britney as far as star power goes.  Didn't Anthony Hopkins win an Oscar or two?  He should have brought them to the set of FRACTURE and gifted them to Ryan Gosling, as his successor, say on a break from filming, livened up the craft table or whatever it's called.  For Gosling is the new Hopkins and in fact, when Hopkins was on the screen, the movie got unexpectedly dull--or if not dull, then incredibly obvious.  It was like a successor to HANNIBAL--say Clarice got tired of being married to the ancient Hannibal Lecter and started cheating on him with a local detective--of course HL would seek his revenge, starting by shooting her point blank and leaving her for dead.<br /><br />As Clarice Lecter--I mean, Jennifer Crawford, the lovely actress Embeth Davidtz who was so good in JUNEBUG turns in an amazing performance here, and the odd thing about it is, she's in a coma through most of it.  Not since the poet John Giorno snooxed through 5 and a half hours of Andy Warhol's early feature SLEEP (1963) has any leading player spent so much of a film out cold.<br /><br />As for the plot, how on earth could Crawford make sure that his wife's boyfriend would be the one who came to his door after the shot was fired?  If the whole basis of his plot rested on that happening, it's even more ludicrous than it seems at first glance.  But Ryan Gosling whispered to me, \\"Kevin, just relax, don't think about tomorrow, just go with the flow and smile from every inch of your body.\\"  He's so good to me, I could forgive him anything.snooxed through 5 and a half hours of Andy Warhol's early feature SLEEP (1963) has any leading player spent so much of a film out cold.

B000VNMMRA|4.0|It's been twelve years since Bruce Willis yelled \\"yippeee-ki-yay\\" before dispatching the villain on turn in Die Hard With a Vengeance. After bringing his most famous character back to life, I'm happy to say that he's made a good decision and long time fans won't be disappointed with the new film: Live Free or Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is a runaway success: the notable lack of CGI and very high stunt factor give the film a satisfying old-fashioned feel. There's also a lot of fun to be had in Die Hard 4.0 and that fun starts with Bruce Willis himself. His McClane is still pounding the streets but his hair has all gone. The script makes plenty of fun at McClane advancing years.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is overblown and predictable and I won't even dwell in an explanation that will leave us with more questions than answers. In short: A new villain is threatening to shut down America's power supplies. Only one man can stop him (we know who), and McClane is helped by a young computer hacker (Justin Long) to stop the potential armaggedon.<br /><br />What follows is one fantastically realized chase sequence or fight sequence or both after another, as McClane battles the baddies and gets progressively more torn up with each passing minute. But this is John McClane, so we know he ain't dying anytime soon.<br /><br />Each stunt outdoes the next, and the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time on little things like dialogue. Any talking is short and sweetened with one-liners. Director Len Wiseman keeps the action and humour coming thick and fast, but this is Bruce's show - and he doesn't disappoint.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|If you like the Dexter novels, you will like the DVD of season 1. It is  more fun than the book, follows the first Dexter novel quite a bit, but expands. All the actors are great, especially the actor playing Dexter.  You have to like him and feel for him. A basic tenet of good fiction is characters you care about. Both the novel and the series have created that in Dexter. Highly recommended for all Dexter fans.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Considering the Disney empire was founded on a mouse, it would be harsh to dismiss Ratatouille simply because it's about a rat as even the most rodent-phobic will be melting for this charming dish.<br /><br />This is Pixar's second collaboration with Disney since it's fusion. And while Ratatouille may lack the pioneering invention and sardonic wit of some of Pixar's previous films, there is plenty to enjoy.<br /><br />Ratatouille has a culinary flavour as it tells the story of Remy, a rat with a passion for cooking. Much of the film is set in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a restaurant so realistically rendered it's possible to almost smell the mouthwatering aromas lingering around.<br /><br />Remy is possessed with a more sophisticated taste than his brother Emile and the rest of his rat colony. He is visited by the ghost of his cooking hero, Gusteau, whose motto is 'Anyone can cook' and encourages Remy to use his catering skills to rescue his restaurant whose reputation has floundered since his passing.<br /><br />Once there, Remy befriends Linguini, the garbage boy. Hiding under Linguini's chef's hat, Remy indicates the talentless boy how to create fabulous dishes, quickly raising both Linguini's and the restaurant's reputation. Ratatouille cleverly explores the restaurant world with its envious rivalries and turbulent kitchen politics. Through stories of jealousy, intrigue, friendship and love, Ratatouille tells us what it takes to overcome a lack of self esteem and to become the person (or rat) you were meant to be.<br /><br />Ratatouille is also filled with other life's lessons. How do you deal with family members who don't see the potential in you? How do you handle people who are emotionally close to you who want you to bend the law for their benefit? Do you become something bigger than you are, or can you achieve the same results by just being honest?<br /><br />Like any good story, this one operates at many levels. Children will love the simplicity of the message, the funny chases, while adults will love the complexity and reality of the relationships. Ratatouille is the name of a simple peasant food that if prepared with care, will rival anything you can serve in the best restaurants of the world. It is also symbolic of our own lives. It may be simple, but if we lead it with care, love and kindness, it will be as good and valuable as the life of the most notorius man in the world.e complexity and reality of the relationships.

B00005JPRT|4.0|This couldn't have been better if Sean O Faoilean had written the story and Christy Moore had written the songs and directed the film. This is a charming story about two musicians who fall into an unconsummated love, but whose passion for each other is remarkable. And you can take the kids to it as everyone keeps their knickers on and apart from the occasional FECK! there's nothing to corrupt the minds of the tinkers.<br />The first 5 to 10 minutes of this film are so perfectly Dublin that it ought to be required viewing for anyone with an Irish avocation. And I'll leave it at that. The visual comedy of The Guy's guitar is just such a perfectly deft Dub stroke that it keeps all the sentimentality at bay. These are two souls who are joined by the passion of the music they create, and another of the perfect tones of the film is just how tellingly the story captures the songwriting and recording process. Having completed a couple of discs, I can tell you that they got it right, to the very last detail.<br />The tunes fit the story and while they may not be the greatest songs ever written, they have an emotional honesty that will remind you of Christy Moore or MIke Scott, and in that regard they are brilliant. In the end, the love goes unconsummated but not unrequited, and you'll just have to go see the film. I'll certainly pick it up on DVD as it reminds me of someone from a long time ago, and as I left the theatre, I could tell there were hosts of others with similar thoughts. This is a very genuine story, exceptionally well told, well written, well performed.
1400064287|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books of all time. If you liked The Tipping Point and/or Blink, you'll love this one! Well written with lots of useful lessons and stories. I'm going to read it again as well as sign up for a training that the author is offering in Hartford on November 13th.
032147404X|1.0|[[ASIN:032147404X The Digital Photography Book]]      I read a couple of reviews that pointed out this author's ill considered attempt to insert humor in a book that is alleged to help folks with their digital photography, but I didn't pay attention.  What a mistake!!  The nonsense begins on the very first page and continues for what seems like forever, and he isn't even funny!!  Why do so many people think that good comedy is easy, when it is actually far more difficult that digital photography.  If you are willing to suffer through this stuff to be told that you need to steady the camera to get sharp pictures and pay attention to good posing to get good porrtraits, then ignore this review and buy this book.  If you want your tips straight, then buy one of the many other good primers on digital photography that are on Amazon!!
031286504X|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago on a whim.  I was in the mood for a little horror, and the cover looked cool, so I thought I would check it out.  I was absolutely blown away.  The book could really be considered more of a psychological drama than a horror story.  The way Matheson sets up his world and the dramatic conflicts that face the main character, Robert Neville, is superb.  I will not go into the plot of the book, since plenty of other reviewers have already done so.  I will just say that I was enthralled by the book, and I had a hard time putting it down.  As for the short stories that accompany this edition, I found most of them to be pretty good, especially Person to Person, and the short but funny The Funeral.  Do yourself a favor and get this book!

B000M341QE|5.0|Blood, violence, crime, treason. The grand american director, Martin Scorsese, woke up again with a fantasic \\"Mob Opera\\" called The Departed.<br /><br />Based on the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed revolves around Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his relationship with two young men who lead double lives in their objectives to serve and prosecute him. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is befriended and protected by Costello at a young age and has subsequently gone to build a successful career as a detective with the Massachusetts State Police Department. It's a position he uses to help Costello. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young rookie cop has been given by his boss the covert mission of infiltrating Costello's mob in an effort to nail him.<br /><br />The script is full with sharp dialogue, with many of it reserved for the abusive mouth of Dignam (Mark Wahlberg in yet another brilliant performance). Everyone gets good lines in William Monahan's screenplay, but the best, understandably, goes to Nicholson himself.<br /><br />Damon and DiCaprio are nicely contrasted; What we get from them is extraordinary; both turn sharp and complex performances. As for Nicholson, his villainy presence is a welcome treat, a mix of pure evil and wicked sense of humor. This is the kind of performance that no one else could possibly do, but which he could do in his sleep.<br /><br />As for Scorsese, it is a return to his fluent, muscle-flexing movie-making. This is a monumental work, a crime thriller that leaves behind its remake status by coming off as fresh and original. This is a brilliant story retold with the touch of a master.
B000HIVOI2|4.0|I own this disc although the reviews of subtitle problems.  However, I found the solution!  Do NOT go to the menu screen and select english subtitles.  The correct way to do it is to press your subtitle button on your remote and select English 3.  This will correctly display the alien subtitles without the English subtitles.  Whew!  I am glad I found this out!    4 stars due to no major special features.  The Blu Ray transfer makes this movie look more and more like 1994!  Great movie!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II, along with the first album is quite distinct from the rest of their work. Here is Zeppelin at their utmost raw, incredibly blues and jazz heavy, and yet thunderous in the delivery. Sure, we recognize that most of the tracks are actually covers of older blues songs, but whats important, what makes these songs so goddamn amazing is what Zeppelin brings to the music: Plant's soulful screams and wails, tight guitar riffs, lucid solos, and absolutely explosive drumming. With perhaps the execption of Thank You, every song in Led Zeppelin II is representative of the best of Zeppelin's work. And don't buy the goddamn record for christ-sake, just download it illegally off of the internet.
0930289234|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already.  This is the \\"Hamlet\\" of the comic book world.  The \\"Godfather\\" of comics, if you will.  The \\"Moving Pictures\\" of the comic book industry.  What Moore and Gibbons have crafted here is a wonder unrivaled in the comics world.  The sheer level of detail that they put into their work is astounding.  Literally every single panel on every single page contains something important, some detail that if noticed, will make the reading experience that much more magical.  I savored over this book for about two weeks before I finished it.  It took me about two hours per chapter.  This isn't the type of book that you can just breeze through, like many of today's comics.  You will find yourself deeply drawn into this world and the lives of its characters.  They will become like old friends to you.  The mystery, the intrigue, the action...its all fantastic.  You are in for a fantastic experience when you read The Watchmen.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Humanity: Hour 1 is absolutely incredible.  the reviewer here who said it's too full of ballads is nuts, but he also called \\"No One Like You\\" a ballad, so he's clearly an odd guy anyway.     This album updates their sound while bringing back the best of what they do.        They are clearly back to the creativity, heavy riffs and toughness of Virgin Killer and Animal Magnetism, as well as the depth of songs like \\"Winds of Change\\" and party rock of \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\"  However, if you know the music of the Disturbed, H.I.M. and the heavier Smashing Pumpkins, you know that those are the bands that Rudy Schenker and Klaus Meine were probably listening to when they made this.    Top songs on the album are 321, Hour 1, Love Will Keep Us Alive, The Game of Life, and more.  Really, every song is good.  I'm not crazy about \\"Loving me to Death\\" but even that is better than most songs from most of their records.    One thing that makes this CD deeper than most is that most songs here are in the context of the end of the world.  So \\"love will keep us alive\\" conveys a struggle for survival, and not in a cheesy cliche way.   321 is the only song here about \\"rocking\\" here, but it's actually a countdown to extinction, with lyrics like: \\"Save me, cause the world's gonna stop, baby 3 2 1, are you ready to rock.\\"        As much as I love the classic Scorpions, I never thought they could come back this strong.  Put it up against any CD in your collection.  be sure to buy the album and spread the word so they can make more albums like this one.
0060763892|4.0|As a new reader to James Rollins, I didn't have any pre-set expectations. What I found is an appreciation for the work and curiosity to see what other books Rollins has written. Enter the past: Marco Polo, famed explorer of antiquity, who discovers a secret he takes with him to the grave. The story ties into an outbreak of a virus in the Indonesian islands, that threatens to mutate the bio-genetic code of life on the planet. The members of Sigma Force deploy against the eco threat, racing in time and at-odds with an international Guild, that threatens to weaponize the seemingly unstoppable hazard.<br /><br />Plenty of action to keep you turning pages like fan blades. The characters are distinct enough, albeit without much depth. The story is engaging enough to keep your interest and see how the protagonists escape one peril after another. With plotlines converging around a treasure hunt of sorts, angelic script ties into the mystery of genetic code--It all adds up to an engaging, thought-provoking read.
B000031XBQ|5.0|ABBA in total Spanish was a treat I did not expect!  I honestly believe the songs on this album sound better in Spanish than English...and I am a Georgia native.  The vitality and beauty of the songs remains true to the classic, and I wish I could buy more in Spanish.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|First single is amazing.  I just wish the rest of the album was a little bit \\"Stronger.\\"  Kanye is amazing.  I feel like his music is really about something...not the frivolous nursery rhyme/gimmick crap.  But I have to admit I skipped through alot of this album on the first listen.  Maybe I have ADHD, but if you don't catch me in the first 30 seconds then I'm movin' on.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this book after flipping through it a little, mainly for the humor value.  I didn't think it would consist of much more than that. How wrong I was.  I started reading it, and ended up reading the whole book cover to cover.  The way the author presents everything, it really makes you believe that a zombie outbreak could happen at any time.  The subject is treated as seriously as any other survival manual would be (which actually adds to the humor).  So many great tips are offered, such as what types of buildings make the best strongholds, what weapons are best (and worst), and what types of environment offers the best protection.  The \\"real life accounts\\" section adds to the realism of the book, and is actually quite creepy in some places.  After reading this manual, you will have all the knowledge you will need to get yourself prepared for a zombie outbreak.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|At his age, he's got the wisdom a seasoned player, gentle, nothing to prove, just ever so tasteful and wonderful. Already an understated player who believes less-is-more, Mark K. settles down even more and he gives out the solos sparingly in favor of long,sustained chords that drone like the early rock and roll of Duanne Eddy.   So good it is.
B00005JPTA|5.0|I emphasized the \\"ADULT-THEMED\\" idea in my title because one of the best things about seeing a film like EASTERN PROMISES is that it is so adult, so uncompromised.  Cronenberg gets to make the movies he wants to, and it doesn't have to be watered down or dumbed-down to make it sell to a broad audience.  We get a brutal, sometimes squirm-inducing look at a underworld we haven't seen like this before...and there's no gloss, no pandering to a teen audience, no sappy ending, etc. etc.  The ending is SATISFYING...but it isn't easy or \\"Hollywood.\\"    First of all, the script is outstanding.  From the creator of another stunning film about London's \\"seamy underbelly,\\" DIRTY PRETTY THINGS...the plot makes sense, the threads all come together and the characters are simply but sharply delineated.  Yet at no time do I feel the themes are being spoon-fed.  Also, some of the acts that are perpetrated on Viggo Mortensen's character near the end of the film are acts of amazing betrayal...yet if you haven't been paying attention, you might miss that.  It's not a super-complex plot...but it doesn't grab you by the hand and lead you from place to place.    Speaking of Mortensen...this is his best performance ever.  Granted, Aragon is crown-jewel, and he handled it well...but those films were events, such spectacle that often what he simply needed to do was wear his costume, ride his horse and look great.  In EASTERN PROMISES, he has to make us care about a very nasty piece of work indeed.  He's also very stony-faced...so much of what we learn about him, especially early on, comes from very subtle work.  Again, each word of the script is perfectly chosen, and Mortensen digs deep here.  He's not always my favorite actor...I actually wasn't nuts about him in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (A film I otherwise greatly admired)...but he's perfectly cast here.  And of course, he's amazing to watch in the now infamous nude fight scene.  It's a little bit distracting being aware of male full-frontal nudity flashing around...almost enough to take one out of the scene...but the scene is so well staged that the sheer PAIN of it soon wipes out any feeling of \\"hey, we get to see ALL of Viggo Mortensen.\\"    Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the older patriarch of the Russian mafia family, and he's the best of this type of character I've seen in awhile.  You know the one...the old gangster who is so sweet and loving to the youngsters in his family, so polite and full of grace and manners.  Picture Brando in the wedding scenes of THE GODFATHER or even Paul Newman in early scenes of ROAD TO PERDITION.  Stahl is even better...his eyes twinkle with charm.  But boy, when the mask drops and we see the real guy...still soft-spoken and considered...he's stunningly evil.  I really enjoyed seeing him again...it seems like it's been awhile since he was in a film.    Vincent Cassel plays Stahl's hot-headed son...another gangster cliche...the kid who is supposed to take over the business, but is actually a bit of a moron and troublemaker.  But again, the character has surprises up its sleeve.  Also, Naomi Watts plays the nurse who brings a motherless baby unwittingly into this underworld...and she is reliably good.  Her character doesn't get to have all the dramatic flourishes...but Watts gives another patented, fully committed, honest performance.  I believe she may be our most under-rated actress, even though she has been nominated for awards and starred in many films...I think she's still undervalued.  EASTERN PROMISES won't win her new fans or an Oscar...but she is still very good.    Notice I didn't talk much about the plot.  Others have done it better, and to be honest, I'd love it if you just went to see the film having little idea of what you were about to experience.  It's a brutal journey...but it is full of unexpected turns...not just of plot but of character.  I'll bet come year end, this will still be one of my favorites of the year!  Highly, highly recommended for ADULT audiences!!
1594489505|5.0|Wow! If you enjoyed The Kite Runner, you'll enjoy this book. Set again in his native Afghanistan, Hosseini tells a heartbreaking and moving story that grabs you from the start and pulls you into a woman's world in Afghanistan. The characters come to life in this book and drag your emotions along the way. The plot is sufficiently explained in other reviews. I would only add that you should plan a day or two that you can focus on reading because once you start you will not want to put this book down. After two compelling novels, Hosseini has proven himself to be a master storyteller.
B00008J2PG|4.0|This is an awesome and hugely entertaining movie, except for one MAJOR historical inaccuracy: the negative portrayal of the Pope, who is made to appear more concerned about art treasures in the Vatican than about human lives. The truth is that he secretly instructed Catholic clergy to save lives by any means, and asked churches and convents throughout Italy to shelter Jews.  In Rome, 155 convents and monasteries sheltered some 5,000 Jews, 3,000 found refuge at one time at the Pope's summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, and hundreds lived within the walls of the Vatican.  One Jewish woman even gave birth in the Vatican.  If it weren't for that, I'd give the movie five stars - and I recommend it anyway.  Just ignore the absolutely lame portrayal of the Pope.  Everything else is great.
B000FGGE68|1.0|This is just a wretched, unwatchable movie. I would give it zero stars, but the Amazon system doesn't go that low. You could say the acting is lousy, except I'm not sure you can even call it acting. The special effects were smoother but ofherwise less interesting than Super Mario. I watched about a third of the movie and had to stop, the pain of viewing this trash was just unbearable. I've seen Mila in other movies that were pretty fun to watch, so I have to place the blame on the director here.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I bought this more or less on a whim, after having read a few words about Tool's style and influences. 10 000 days is an odd object, a booklet with integrated 3D goggles and psychedelic drawings supposed to come to life when watched through the goggles. Since I have no sight from my right eye, I can't say that I spent too much time on the packaging.    The music, however, I found really interesting. This is heavy, powerful stuff, much more so than the classics of rock I regularly enjoy like Black Sabbath or AC/DC. I love Tool's sound: it's dry and sharp yet greasy with distorsion.  The thing I was slightly worried about was the singing, since modern metal tends not to know singing, only growling or yelling. But vocalist Maynard James Keenan has a melodious - if veiled - voice, and does not overdo it in the yelling department. The rest of the team is the classic guitar, bass and drums line-up, with more than a little studio work adding other instruments, texture, layered guitar parts, etc.    Beyond the instrumentation, however, what's interesting in 10 000 days is the writing. Tool's songs are long and complex, and in this a pure heritage of the 70s progressive rock I like so much. Odd time signatures, changes in rhythm and mood, varying intensities, even unusual instruments are all featured in this album. The intro to opening track Vicarious is quite moody, until the drum and bass kick in on a very heavy riff over an odd time signature (I'm not good enough a musician to tell you what it is) and it's quite representative of the approach. The lyrics are somber, in line with the overall mood of the album. The faster paced Jambi follows, alternating loud and heavy parts with more introspective sections (complete with little Pink Floyd-esque hommage riffs).    The piece of resistance, however, is the two parter Wings for Marie, a near 20 minutes epic song with religious undertones (I can't quite figure if it's a remission piece on Lucifer and where Marie comes into it,but in any case it's very evocative). In this central piece, all the elements that make the rest of the album are apparent: the alternating moods and rhythms, the construction, the somberness, etc. Very cool stuff.    I'm told that Tool's previous album Lateralus is even better, I'll be hunting that one down now. In the meantime, I'm pretty happy with that trial. I really enjoyed King Crimson's The Power to Believe which had a comparable soundscape, and I'm pleased have discovered something similar yet different. If you like prog rock and/or metal, you should be more than pleased with this.
B00009P1O2|3.0|However I LOVE Queen this dvd is too much for a fan....<br />I would have prefered less hours but more quality on the sound. If you play it on a regular DVD you will hear it fine, but if you use a Home Theather you will hear the lack of quality in the sound.<br /><br />Anyway.... at the end is Queen....!
B000FSME1A|4.0|I'm not going to sit here and write a review of Apocalypse Now, nor the Redux (which I have yet to see).    I will however, provide a review of the DVD itself.      First of all, the packaging is creative.  Simply put, it's a nice box.  When you open it is when the problems arise.    My main problem with this DVD release is that for some reason, rather than put one version of the film on one disc and the other version on another disc, the two films are split, half of each film on each disc.  This cannot be a space issue, because the films are split at about the halfway mark, and in any case we all know that lengthy films can be fit on a single DVD (see Lord of the Rings).  So what happens is about halfway through the film it asks you to switch discs, which serves to take you out of the film pretty abruptly.    Also, the way the discs are arranged makes it impossible to get to the second disc while the first is in place.    I can't comment on the special features as I have not watched them yet.    Overall, this is a great film that deserves to be watched all the way through continuously.  Unfortunately this DVD does not allow that to happen.
0679746323|5.0|Very well researched book. Gives you an overlook on the real Mao and how the rest of the world misinterpreted him. Shows how America was superficial in assessing how the real Mao would be and how it applied pressure on Chiang Kai Shek to enforce cease fire on Mao's critical turning point of the civil war thus making it possible for Mao to conquer China. Mao killed his colleagues and his enemies alike for the sole purpose of  gaining and retaining power. All means were legitimate in his eyes to achieve that goal. It looks like we never learn from these mistakes. This attitude makes us helping the Taliban to be a prominent force and Al Qaeda flourish in Iraq, a place they have never been before the invasion. Easy reading with simple language with tons of new info reflecting our lack of knowledge about someone so important.
B00005JPRD|4.0|This film attempts to show the greatness of the Beatles by weaving together the Fab Four's songs into a sumptuous visual feast. And everyone's here: Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, Hey Jude, Sexy Sadie, Dear Prudence, Dr. Robert, Mr. Kite, JoJo from \\"Get Back,\\" and of course Lovely Rita.<br /><br />Lucy's the all-American girl; Jude's the coal miner from across the pond. By chance they meet, fall in love, but their perfect romance faces a blip when their views of the war in Vietnam bubble into misunderstandings and distance. Meanwhile, Lucy's brother Max has been drafted into the much hated war and everyone fears for his safety.<br /><br />The use of multimedia is gorgeous, especially for the segment for \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" Other memorable scenes include a journey to the sky for \\"Dear Prudence\\" and a cartoonish bus ride for \\"I am the Walrus.\\" This is definitely an artsy flick, so viewers who don't like artsy flicks but dig the Beatles will have a hard time digesting the 60s-themed middle. All I can tell you is close your eyes and enjoy the music, but you will miss out on some stunning visuals.<br /><br />The love story though, is not thoroughly played out; there are times when it actually takes a back seat so a Lennon/McCartney ballad can fill in. I'm all for Beatles songs but I thought I was going to see more story for Jude and Lucy. At times it felt like the songs were just a filler, which is a pity. Young actors Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess had a lot of energy to the parts that wasn't completely taken advantage of. Some of the secondary characters, like Sadie and JoJo, felt like they were tacked on just to add more minutes to the film. They can sing though, and Sadie's brief rendition of \\"Helter Skelter\\" carries a lot of soul.<br /><br />Even though I am disappointed in the execution of the story, the music, the bits of choreographed chaotic dance, and the trippy middle make it all worthwhile.
0375703861|5.0|I loved this book so much, I wanted to beg all my friends to read it so I would have someone to discuss it with!      Zadie Smith is a superb talent.
0452285186|3.0|Very cute humor but...    Unless your getting this as a gift for someone or it's an inside joke you've been looking for your whole life, I don't recommend buying this book simply because it is too short. Cute though... Not for animal rights advocates.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I had such high expectations for this film. I heard many great things about this musical. Struggling actors trying to make their dreams come true and who are trying to find love. Well, I must have picked up the wrong DVD.   They complain that their landlord is going to kick them out because they haven't paid their rent in 1 yr. Let's feel sorry for the leaches of society.   A strung out 19 yr old stripper with a heroin addiction & AIDS tries to seduce her neighbor. While attempting to get this guy into bed, she neglects to mention her deadly diagnosis, not knowing that he has it as well. She was willing to put someone else's life in danger so that she could satisfy her own needs. So typical of a drug addict.   These characters seemed to look at being a success in life as failure. They needed to be failures to feel ok about things. When one of them tried to do something that was successful, they seemed to feel guilty about leaving the others behind. They'd ditch their reality to live in a rat infested apartment without heat, lights, or food.    Five of the main characters had AIDS and every single one of them lead risky lifestyles. Then were totally and completely shocked when diagnosed.   They could have really done something meaningful with this film. I was truly disappointed with the message this movie was sending out. Life can be tough, but it doesn't make it any easier when a compromised person is buying drugs, shooting up, stripping, ripping off ATM machines, and then complaining that the world owed them. Grow up, get a job, get clean, use protection, and pay your rent!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|They did a great job with this one. Very stylish and engaging character intro at the beginning, and it quickly moved along to the main story. As far as the story goes, this is a great take on a detective story, but it's also a great spoof of detective story at the same time. Gotta love the ending, had me rolling on the floor.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a must have DVD. We have been totally amazed by the scenes. If you have a HDTV, this is must for your collection.
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Director Tom Tykwer decided to take on a project many directors previously rejected for considering it `unfilmable', with `Run Lola run' as a reference he started to work on this project. The result? An excellent adaptation that makes the experience of watching this film feel almost like reading the book.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Patrick Suskind, `Perfume' tells the story of a singular character born with an enhanced sense of smell that enables him to identify and separate all smells he can detect. The character seems also to be cursed as everyone related to him ends up badly. When he gets obsessed with the smell of a virgin he then looks to learn how to capture the essence of things so he can obtain the smells he wants to create the ultimate perfume.<br /><br />The story in the movie is guided by a narrator (John Hurt) and has most of the story arcs from the novel; some details were removed but they aren't really to be missed, in the novel for example, Grenouille creates a perfume with the smell of human that is not shown in the film. From beginning to end the adaptation is incredibly accurate, but even though the ending is exactly the same as the one in the book (even the same lines), the ending didn't feel quite well to me in the movie, I remember it having a deeper effect on me when I read it.<br /><br />The style Tykwer uses to show the smell of things in interesting and in the same format of effects used in `Run Lola run', the music fits well with the movie as it uses haunting themes that complement the visuals to create a dark mood for the film.<br /><br />Other than a 30 minutes documentary of the making of the film, there are no special features. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround and English/French/Spanish subtitles. The lack of extras really don't compensate for the price, you can get the movie for a cheaper price in the amazon market place instead. This detail explains the star I took from the review.<br /><br />If you read the novel you definitely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema. If you haven't you don't really need to read the novel first unless you'd like to compare details.initely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema.

1400063515|3.0|There's no doubt that Nassim Taleb is a brilliant man. And, there's no doubt that he is frustrated by having to work among people who don't get it.  What is there to get?  Simply that the quest for certainty -- through mathematics, science or other logic disciplines -- may end up being the very thing which obfuscates the truth; that we end up not being able to see the forest for the trees.  I think what he is saying is that there can never be certainty; that there will always be Black Swans...random events.<br />The reason why I say \\"I think\\" that is what he is saying is because there is so much stuff here -- a lot of which is totally irrelevant.  He talks about his home town, seemingly just to wax nostaligic, though he may use the vignette to talk -- belaboredly -- about a point.  Among the other stuff he presents is: an unusally high regard for the French language; too much - again irrelevant - reference to and back-story about thought leaders, and; palpable disdain for some colleagues in the quantitative field.  If you can get through all of that and hold on to the nuggets, though, you will see some fresh thinking.  Just his distinction between 2 different systems of thought is worth the work required.  There are other presentations which may shift the way you think about things, too.  In the end, it's worth reading, but you will have to focus on what's important because he doesn't.

B000P0J024|5.0|It was only recently when I read in a review for one of the old editions of the volumes 1 and 3 that a reviewer was wondering if these albums would ever be re-released someday. This new release comes as the ultimate anthology as it includes volumes 1 and 3, and even though volume 2 never existed, an extra DVD included in this set has been labeled as disc 2.<br /><br />There is little to say about the volumes 1 and 3 that has not been said already by other reviewers. Just think of an album made by a band formed by George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, that is what you get here!<br /><br />In volume one, the genius of these five friends hiding behind glasses and using alternate `Wilbury' names made one of the best albums in rock history (several music magazines have selected volume 1 as one of the best albums ever); volume one includes classic songs like Harrison's `Handle with care', `Rattled', Orbison's incredible `Not alone anymore', Dylan's well remembered `Tweeter and the monkey man' and of course `End of the line'. Volume one has been complemented with two previously unissued songs, `Maxine' and `Like a ship', two songs that were obviously added to make the release more attractive and complete.<br /><br />Volume three (a volume two was never released) has always been recognized as the small brother of volume one, mainly because it was recorded after Orbison's death and also because of Dylan being a more prominent piece, a rather unfair valuation as it contains great songs and it's an incredible follow up to volume one. The album is dedicated to the memory of Lefty Wilbury (Orbison's Wilbury name). The powerful `She's my baby' that opens the album can be still heard today and you won't notice the passing of the years on it. Other classics included are `Inside out', Dylan's `Deadly sins', the incredible `New blue moon' and of course the `Wilbury twist'. Extra tracks included are `Nobody's child' and the Wilbury version of `Runaway'.<br /><br />Both albums come remastered and sound better than ever, but the real highlight is the DVD. The documentary called `The true history of the traveling Wilburys' clarifies once and for all how the project started and what caused the reunion of these five super stars (there were many stories about it that are proven incorrect on this documentary). The recording sessions are shown as well as rehearsals and alternate versions of some songs are briefly shown. The death of Orbison (Lefty Wilbury) is also mentioned when the band decided to continue with the recording of the video for `End of the line' and the idea of using his guitar came up. All the promotional videos are also included: \\"Handle with care\\", \\"End of the line\\", \\"She's my baby\\", \\"Inside Out\\" and \\"Wilbury twist\\".<br /><br />If you've never heard any of these albums don't hesitate and get them, if you already own them, the extra tracks and the DVD are worth the purchase of this set.tered and sound better than ever, but the real highlight is the DVD.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|OK: here's the deal: this album is different than the old stuff, but it is still a great listen.    I find that people are really getting down on LP for having some slower songs, but people evolve over time as does their art.  LP has done a masterful job of growing and fusing their hard rock style with some new more thoughtful songs.    If you are looking for more of Hybrid Theory and Meteroa then you will probably be disappointed, but if you are willing to try something new then you are really going to like this album.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|this is a beautiful video and cd , the pure talent and beauty of the group , combined with the ties to other modern Irish greats , such as Clannad and Enya, make this a very enjoyable occasion. They have been shown on American pbs and exemplify such giftedness. It entertains the audience but gives Irish Americans great pride as we can see our roots and the great future of the Irish people on the world stage. My favorites are Orinoco Flow and Dulaman but each performer and song are well worth the time spent and very spiritual and inspirational.
0767827902|4.0|As the author behind Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment and Brokeback Mountain, Larry McMurtry can be criticized for labored pacing, as he slows the action of his stories to delve deep into the souls of his characters. If captured accurately on screen, however, no characters possess the depth and dimension of his creations. Whether it's aging Texas Rangers on one last adventure or a combative mother and daughter, McMurtry's characters play on screen like real people we all know.    Such is the case of the 1951 youth found in The Last Picture Show, a film unlike most teenage comedies and dramas because it does not appeal to the age group it features; rather, it's a grown-up's view of what youth was once like, as the story possesses the perspective and hindsight rarely granted to the young.   The strength of the film lies in capturing the main characters at the pinnacle moment when childhood fades away, as the wall between youth and adulthood crumbles.   So many teen films build a wall around the outside world, giving grown-ups all the importance and voice of Charlie Brown's wonking teacher.    But The Last Picture Show shows adults to be an integral part of growing up, from the old men who live vicariously through the football team, to the town's own Mrs. Robinsons and the oilmen who ogle their boss's daughter.      Some will criticize the story as being plotless, and maybe the character development and relationships could be heightened by more concrete goals and motivations of the characters.  But rather than focusing on what the film is not, it's more important to focus on what it is: a powerfully realistic coming of age story about the emptiness and uncertainty of becoming an adult.
B000ETQPYM|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book. The basic storyline - an ill husband who'd known he would not live past February and who left his young wife a series of notes for her to read in the months past his death - sounded so promising, especially for a romantic sap like me.     Oh, I liked the first few sentences enough. But from the second page on, reading P.S. I Love You began to get painful - and not because the story was so tender and heart wrenching, but because the writing was so choppy, weak, and poor. It read like my attempts to write weepy love stories in junior high, when I knew not much about love or how to develop a character (or a storyline, for that matter). And while I understand completely that this is, of course, chick lit, and not something from which one should expect too much depth, it is just so far beneath the funny work of talented queens of chick literature (like Sophie Kinsella and Emily Giffin) that it's a shame I can't find my receipt and return this disappointing read.    Here's hoping the movie will be a vast improvement.
0192802631|5.0|Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning.  This book is  a classic, written by a master.  It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention.  It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper.  If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.<br /><br />I read a lot of modern romance fiction.  One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours.  Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author?  One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION.  Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words.  Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction.  It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.<br /><br />Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite.  My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time.  I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective.  PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving.  Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society.  In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England.  Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group.  Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister.  Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth.  This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities.  This book does not specifically leave you with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling.  Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again.  Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars.  And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days.  Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.<br /><br />Do not begin reading this book expecting a \\"romance\\" novel as written today.

B000TGCR38|5.0|One of my special interests is WW II history, especially the Nazi era, and I have watched many fact-based movies dealing with the theme. Black Book is a first-rate thriller that depicts the trials and tribulations of a young Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied Holland. Rachel Stein the lead character is played consummately by the beguiling Carice Van Houten whose facial expressions do a lot more to convey fear, vulnerability, hatred and determination than mere dialogue alone. To ensure her continued survival and escape from certain death that awaits the Jewish populace, Rachel, having suffered the loss of her brother and parents, takes on the guise of an Aryan, Ellis de Vries, and is roped by the Resistance to seduce Ludwig Muntze [Sebastian Koch] a Gestapo officer and steal Nazi secrets.<br /><br />The actors in this movie are well-cast - even the Gestapo officer, whose very title should inspire revulsion is portrayed with a certain sensitivity, and he shows a semblance of humanity, a rare trait for an officer of the Reich. Even knowing Rachel's true Jewish identity, he falls hopelessly in love with her, and this is portrayed with a level of credibility given the contradictions inherent in such a pairing.<br /><br />The action is fast-paced, there is much violence, and yes, even explicit sex, but through it all, nothing detracts from the plot, only serves to enhance the story, and makes this a gripping, must-see WW II thriller.
B00000GAIW|5.0|It really can't be denied that Jethro Tull's Aqualung (1971) is a rock classic. With it's sophisticated rock/folk/jazz sound, timeless characters, thought provoking lyric and subject matter, it 's almost more like a classic novel than an early 1970s rock music album.<br /><br />The album is divided into two sections; Aqualung and My God.<br /><br />Aqualung begins the album with the tale of a despicable/lovable derelict, and it's followed by Cross-Eyed Mary. Mary is an underage prostitute, who \\"gets no kicks from little boys, but rather make it with a letching grey\\". Both songs are rock classics with plenty of electric guitar and singer Ian Anderson's trademark flute and unique vocal interpretations. The English folk-songs, Mother Goose and Wondering Aloud, are pleasant acoustic tunes on the surface, but both hint at the agnostic theme that dominates the second half of the album. Up To Me is a folk/rock ditty of choice and consequence, \\"And if I laughed a bit too fast, well it was up to me\\".<br /><br />My God takes the listener head-first into the album's commentary on God and religon. Anderson's wrath seems to be directed less at God, and more at the church and how religon has molded God into a convenient and manipulative concept.<br /><br />My God (the song) begins as a serious, minor-key acoustic guitar and piano dirge, then turns into a flute and Gregorian chant duet, and finally roars and menaces as a foreboding electric-metal rock song. Hymn 43 is an all-out rock song where Anderson protests the use of God's name to advance a selfish agenda, \\"If Jesus is, then He better save himself from the gory glory seekers who use his name in death!\\". Locomotive Breath is a rock classic that chronicles the spiraling, out-of-control life of an unidentified man who's prayers don't help him to slow things down. Wind-up ends the original album on a more hopeful, but still cynical, note, where Anderson even talks to God, who tells him, \\"I'm not not the kind you have to wind up on Sunday\\". This acknowledges the existence of God, but also the fact that you don't have to go to church on Sunday to know Him.<br /><br />Simply put, Aqualung is an English classic, a rock music album like no other, great folk/rock/jazz music, and a thought-provoking piece of rock art.s the existence of God, but also the fact that you don't have to go to church on Sunday to know Him.

0143038419|1.0|I found this book to be neither insightful or humorous. Okay writing, very self-absorbed, somewhat tedious, rather pointless. I am very surprised by the number of good reviews. It really seemed that she just wanted to feel loved again and that the sex and companionship at the end was all she really needed/wanted.

075640407X|1.0|I could not finish this book because it couldn't keep my attention.  To me, there was no climax, it didn't build to anything.  It kept going on and on and nothing was happening.  I kept picking it back up hoping for a spark, but alas!  I was disappointed.
0316067598|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As a former military member, it was hard for me to put it down and I felt the reader could really feel the author's pain and joy in this book.  His thought process in the book was real, at one time thanking God for his smallest of victories and the next cursing his enemies.  This book reminds military members of why we do the job and possibly offers insight to civilians of the sacrifices made.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|I saw these guys live on the 17th in Baltimore.  Awesome show.  I picked up \\"The Meanest Of Times\\" while I was there.  It's awesome.  It has a good amount of traditional songs on it as well as some really great punk songs.  I also agree with the guy who said that this album is reminicsent of Sing Loud, Sing Proud, which is also a great album.  A great choice for those who are fans of DKM's earlier sound.
B000R34V50|3.0|Superman returned, Batman had begun, and now its time for another classic comic book super hero film franchise to return to the  big screen completely redesigned for the year 2007 while retaining much of the wonderful sibling rivalry that filled the original films with much more then just brainless action and kooky one liners.  Critics are putting this one down rather harshly and yet films like Happy Feet got showered with golden rains of praise but in the end that golden rain was just piss. Quite frankly critics have lost any and all sensibility when it comes to which films they choose to unilaterally praise or completely trash.        If you visit rottentomatoes.com TMNT is sitting pretty low on the tomatometer.  Reviews like that can worry any hardcore turtle fan but allow me to ease your fears.  TMNT brings back the look and style from the original Laird/Eastman comics.  The CG animation is sparkling marred only by the lackluster design of the human characters April and Casey Jones. The films centerpiece is a brotherly fight in the rain between Leonardo and Raphael. Rain has never looked so good. The film really fails to live up to this highly emotional scene when we finally reach the far more substandard subplot involving immortal statues and ancient monsters from another dimension.          The voice work is standard fair but nothing stands out as terribly as the truly awful Splinter, voiced by a man simply known as Mako, who recently passed away. So at least when the sequel comes around we can get something that sounds a little more like the original splinter other than one who drank just a little too much sake before  each scene. Splinter slurs his wisdom like a drunk whino holding onto his buddies shoulder trying to keep from falling off the bar stool. The turtles sound like you expect them too and Sarah Michelle Gellar goes unnoticed as April O' Neil.               The film  has some really impressive action seqeuences and does a fine job of setting itselfup for a far better sequel down the line. This one will have to settle for being just slightly above average. If you are a turtles fan, like me, you will find much to enjoy in this revival of a long dead franchise. So lets toast some sake to our favorite foursome because they are back to kick some serious shell!
0618711678|4.0|If you have somehow achieved sufficient literacy to read user reviews on Amazon, and still believe that people are basically good, now's your chance to read a book that will relieve you of this misconception.  King Leopold's Ghost gives historical proof that there is no problem in recruiting enough people to torture, humiliate, and kill perfectly innocent Africans by the millions.      All I can say is thank God for the press and for Christian missionaries.  If it hadn't been for those two institutions, the horror in Africa perpetrated by the Belgian king would have continued unabated until all of the land drained by the Congo river was stripped of all human inhabitants.
B000Q6GURU|5.0|Director Craig Brewer follows up his stellar work in Hustle n Flow with another provocative southern drama but this time he takes us from the halls of hip hop to the down and dirty bars of the blues. Hustle n Flow was about a man with a dream, Black Snake Moan is about what happens to those who no longer have them.      This film is energized from beginning to end with the kind of images that will excite your senses and perhaps even make you a bit uncomfortable. If the thought of an intimidating black man chaining up a white woman to his radiator doesn't quite fit with your world perspective then this film is clearly not for you.  Samuel L. Jackson is Lazerus, a man who just lost his wife of many years to another man. He speaks with the kind of authority and thunder that can only come out of the bible days. When he speaks other characters listen and that's just how it goes.  Christina Ricci plays Ray a girl who wants nothing more then to just stay at home with her lover, played by Justin Timberlake, but when he goes off to war she goes into one of her many nymphomaniac fits and eagerly seeks out the most nearby rod on which to satisfy her urges. After one particularly bad night of drinking and sex she ends up on Lazerus' doorstep, beaten and knocked out, this is where both of their lives will change forever.      There are some very strong images in this film, besides of course the obvious one of Ray tied up in chains. Its like the south is getting revenge for all those years of slavery. It's a racially charged image and when it hits you you're not quite sure what to do with it. Even more so when she embraces them in order to calm down one of her carnal fits. Sexual tension is ripe in the air as Ray tries to tempt the noble Lazerus who finds enough strength to turn down her advances and try to truly help this lost soul. Lazerus never comes off righteous as he even admits to Ray that he is not a perfect man, in one particular scene he goes into a fit mistaking Ray for his wife ranting and yelling at her because he just couldn't hold onto her. Strangely now he gets his control over this one particular woman, although of course with the best of intentions.      These are just a few of the many underlying themes explored in the film. The situation itself is downright absurd but it's used to such amazing effect that it truly is the best way to explore the places most films dare not tread. Another strong point in the film is the music, its electric, it soulful and haunting. The blues is a living breathing element and theirs a reason the characters sing it and you can see them live it in every frame. Even Ray gets her chance to let out her woes in one very simple yet beautiful scene where she sings the only song she knows, \\"this little light of mine.\\" Somehow within the confines of all this imagery the film manages to create some very real and lovely characters. Lazerus and Ray have formed a bond that will last a lifetime.      The film is shot like its straight out of a pulp comic book. The south is never stylized but it comes off raw and carries within it a spark of blood and dirt in every scene.  It's got strong characters and a well-written script. Its the kind of film that will be long forgotten come award time but those who truly seek out films that are immersive experiences will find this movie and enjoy every minute of it.
159102594X|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a book since I read George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones! Speaking of which, be careful stacking Joe Abercrombie too close to GRRM or Steven Erikson, because even though it's less-then-half their size, The Blade Itself may knock them right off the bookshelf!    Finally, a talented writer has combined the straight-forward, character driven; adventure tales of old school sword-and-sorcery, with the depth and multi-person-point-view of the modern epic fantasies.     This world is ruled by a centuries-old empire that's oblivious to its rotting core and too arrogant to realize how easily its barbaric enemies may be more then it can handle. Also it seems a dark force may be raising that is the bigger threat.  All this is just the back-drop for a truly character driven tale.     I haven't liked a barbarian as much as Logen Nine-fingers and the Named Men since REH's Conan. Inquisitor Glotka; despite his crippling and the disfiguring POW injuries, may be the most dangerous ally or enemy. Those are a couple players in a story that has some of the most interesting and charismatic characters in the genre. Despite that this is a multi-person-point-view tale; the characters are refreshingly kept to a manageable number.     Be prepared to hit-the-ground running from the first page and be pulled along till the last. And this bone-jarring pace is not all due to the two-fisted action. Mr. Abercrombie has a knack for dialog that's unprecedented in the genre. You'll find yourself snickering or blown-away by the witty banter and one-liners as much as you'll be grabbing the edge-of-your-seat during a running fight.
B00005JPRF|3.0|Resident Evil Extinction promised nothing but a scantly clad Milla Jovovich and lots of zombies. On that front it delivered. If you are going to this movie to see a well thought out and contemplative story, maybe you didn't watch the first two movies.<br /><br />In the first two Resident Evil installments we see the spread of the zombie creating T virus through the Umbrella Corporation compound and then through Raccoon City. In Extinction, the virus has decimated the Earth. Five years later and the T virus has spread to both plant and animal populations making the Earth a barren waste land.<br /><br />Ali Larter plays Claire, a tough as nails mother figure for a band of scavenging survivors. She is joined by the returning Oded Fehr as Carlos. This ragtag group roams town to town trying to stay away from the zombies. The desert is their playground as it was sparsely populated in the first place. Alice, Milla Jovovich, has the same game plan and soon meets up with the group. Umbrella Corp. isn't done with Alice though and that puts the whole group in danger.<br /><br />There are scenes in this movie that will have you rolling your eyes, but the movie had a fun charm to it. The acting is well done all around and there are several homages to zombie movies that have come before. If you like things jumping out at you, you will not be disappointed. This movie isn't smart or cutting edge, and never claims to be. Resident Evil: Extinction is just pure zombie killing action. Not for everyone but fun for some.
0142000671|3.0|You won't get any complaint from me that this book is skillfully written, in it's vivid descriptions of settings, detailed descriptions of characters, and realistic dialogue.    However, I believe this book has a bad message, and the bad message is about how it's ok to put the weak, infirm and dependent to death.  It started with the discussion of Candy's aged dog.  The book gave the impression that the dog's age made him no good to even himself, the \\"quality of life\\" argument that has been advanced to support euthanizing the elderly, weak and infirm.      After discussing Candy's dog, the argument proceded to Candy himself, where he longs to be euthanized when he can no longer work.    Finally, we come to George's murder of the retarded Lennie, which is completely justified by Slim, the voice of the one sympathetic character in the book.  I believe that George was looking for an opportunity to divest himself of Lennie, and that opportunity presented itself when Lennie killed Curley's wife.  It was also mentioned that if Lennie was institutionalized, it would be worse than death.  I realized there are conflicting opinions about the moral nature of George, but I don't believe he was a good character.     As I was writing this review, I recalled Proverbs 31:8-9 \\"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.  Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.\\"  Of Mice And Men describes a world where the advocates for euthanizing the weak and infirm prevail.

B00007JVBI|3.0|I want to say this is one of her more solid releases, but I've always felt Marshall's songwriting was anything but solid. So I guess this would be one of her better embellishments, taking what little framework she has a a pianist/guitarist and spinning it into something a little more edge-like. Most of the time her frail, minimal approach does not succeed simply due to a lack of range. I am all for the style, but one must always learn the rules before unlearning them, Cat Power always sounded like she just skipped those steps. Likewise, when she tries to pull of her more bluesy, southern-styled approach it usually feels rather forced and phony. Still she does land a few stripped-down songs with convincing sincerity, and with a few songs concentrating on some of her less-absorbed, but more absorbing rock work, You Are Free should be considered, if not a step forward for the overrated songwriter, certainly not a step back.
B000068IEU|3.0|(Warning, spoilers contained in this review).<br />Two teenage girls, their names and personalities are not important to this movie, decide to go to a bloodlust concert in the middle of the night by themselves while wearing skimpy outfits and looking for drugs in dark allies from men who look homeless. No, really, I'm not kidding, that's what they do. they go up to some guy, ask for drugs, and then follow him up to his room where, surprise surprise, he, and a bunch of his friends, don't really want to sell them drugs.<br /><br />You can pretty much figure out where this movie goes from there, so I won't bother you in the plot. Two guys break out of prison with the help of one of their sons and a girlfriend, they find two girls they like and pretty much do whatever they want to them right in front of their home. Creepy.<br /><br />A movie like this could have been extremely good, and although it was shocking at times, it never reached a level of great film making. The acting was just horrible, the music made me gag, and the ending was one of the worst I've ever seen in my whole life. But this movie does have its shocking moments. When the mother bites that one guys thing off, I was shocked beyond belief. Did she actually do that? I guess so, the picture on this DVD is so bad I couldn't tell, but that's what it looked like.<br /><br />Looking back, this was probably a bad use of my well earned money, but hey, it only cost me about $5. If you like cheesy horror flicks with nudity, than this might be for you. But let me warn you, other than a few shocking moments, this movie doesn't really have anything to offer. if you read this review, please leave a comment.<br /><br />Replay value; very low.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Great Album....It has not left my CD player since the day I bought it. Kanye is back and this album proves it.

0743277457|5.0|I met this kid a few times (now he is a man). I never beat him in chess, despite the fact that I was already an experienced hustler the first time he appeared with his father in Washington Square. He never developed into an arrogant guy, as others did. He always stayed sweet.    He taught me some valuable lessons about overcoming distractions during competition. When he first informed me that he was going for the Tai Chi championship (of the world) I could hardly believe it because I knew him only as a chess player. He brings unique insights due to his experience in two usually discrrete sporting worlds. He says that he does not believe in fighting, since he does not want to perpetuate the strife in the world, and he says that a gladiator side of him emerged at the championships that he didn't know he had in him. He is back in training now. Perhaps it is time that he finds a new realm to conquer, instead of sticking to the familiar. Then, in ten years, he can relate how he is now champion of some yet unknown sport. That would make him sol et unique.
B00000DC10|5.0|Short version of the review:    Despite it's lack of mainstream recognition, this remains one of the most culturally relevant albums released of all time.  No other band under the genre of punk has since come close to matching the artistic significance and influence of this album (as Born Against, Ink and Dagger, and Nation of Ulysses are their rightful predecessors.)  If you're either a musician or a fan of punk, hardcore, metal, rock, or any of the genres associated with the former four I just listed, buy the album.  I'm not telling you to consider it; I'm commanding you to do so.  It's that important.    Long version of the review:  So late one night in 1999 I'm up watching 120 Minutes (back when MTV used to play music) and between all of the other alternative music that was interchangeable, the video for New Noise appeared.  Now, the TV was on mute during the beginning, so after I read the title of the album was \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\", I scoffed and was like \\"Great, another generic, pop-punk, NoFX clone.\\"    Then I un-muted the TV and subsequently picked my jaw up off the floor.    I obtained the CD out of sheer curiosity regarding what else this CD had to offer.  Maybe it was the fact I was 18, maybe it was a particular lack of exposure to different music styles at that age, but I was hard-pressed as to why I should consider this to be a punk album.  Punk was a form of music that changed little since it's inception; featuring songs usually belted out in two minutes or less, having simple song structure (the guitars riffs having three chords, the drums holding a rapid one-two beat,) and with the lyrical topics typically dealing with the pitfalls of being young and broke, sung by a guy who sounds like he just got done surfing.  What this band was doing was throwing out musically complex songs that were an average of 4 and a half to 5 minutes in length, chock full of syncopated beats, excellent musicianship, electronica, and an energy that was fueled by vocals shouting out their disgust with consumerism and capitalism.  For an album to be considered punk, it was definitely revolutionary, for certain.    All this, from a band that was broken up a year before I ever even heard their name.      Sadly, though great musicians, Refused are evidently not as clairvoyant as I had hoped.  Nearly 9 years after the release of this album, punk has become almost extinct, survived by a breed of kids who've shelved individualism for mass conformity, choosing to play a style of music where the bands copy each other with one-dimensional lyrics (read: lyrics universally dealing with girl problems) that drives kids in hordes to Hot Topic (not voting booths) so they can display to one another how much more \\"emo\\" one is to the next in a laughable Jesus Christ pose.  If those bands could have taken the direction found on this album, what currently constitutes as punk music would have a lot more respect from the music community outside its genre than it does now.      Regrettably, the Refused are f%$&ing dead, and for all intents and purposes, the final nail in punk rock's coffin can't be too far away.
B000HT34RA|2.0|A word to the wise here. Check out the 2003 expanded edition, it contains ALL OF PETER GREEN'S CONTRIBUTIONS- enough said.
B00000J631|4.0|Before AFI went commercial, before Blink-182 rose and fell, before NOFX was working to overthrow George W. Bush, before emo and pop-punk were used interchangeably (and recklessly, may I add), heck, before GWAR went back to being metal, there was the CD.<br /><br />Its funny because you wouldn't typically expect a 101-track CD to be under an hour long, but thats exactly what we have here.  Stylistically speaking, the songs range from old school punk (Circle Jerks), ska (Less than Jake), and gothic rock (The Damned) to hardcore (H20), power violence (Spazz), and yes, pop punk (NOFX and the overwhelming amount of other bands on the CD).  In terms of featured artists, this CD touted a \\"who's who\\" of punk during that era, featuring up-and-comers (most notably AFI, Blink-182, and Unwritten Law before they went into the mainstream) as well as established acts like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Descendants, and Black Flag.<br /><br />I think this CD was not only a legitimate compilation, but also relevant to punk culture of the late 90's, early 2000's.  Owning this CD is equivalent to having a high school yearbook or a time capsule; you get to see what was going during that era, no matter how cool or how goofy things looked.  If a teenager came up to me and was like \\"So what was punk music like when you were in high school?\\", I'd probably tell them to get a copy of this CD, because it was (and still is) a spot on snapshot of what the music and general attitude was like then.<br /><br />Nowadays, there's a Hot Topic in every mall, The Warped Tour is a big corporate event, and being punk is more about fashion than it is about DIY ethic and unity that used to go along with the scene.  Yet when I feel nostalgic, I'll throw this CD on and remember the way things used to be.
B000RHKARY|4.0|I have waited for years for this to come out in a re-mastered package, and here it is.But in this case less would be more, tracks 13-20 were included on the 2003 deluxe edition of \\" A HARD ROAD\\".They are great song's, but Peter Green is the guitarist. As \\"CRUSADE\\" heralded in Mick Taylor, one would have hoped that this expanded edition might have given us more tid-bits from Taylor, or just the mighty fine original.
B000NA1Z1A|4.0|I bought this clean version for a co-worker's 5th grader who had been skipping the roughest words when she sang along with her mother's uncut version.  I wish I had known that the clean version did not have new words to replace the harshest words, just audio masking of the rough words from the original.     For the 'tweener kids, better to decide whether they should listen to a particular song at all (viz., Me and Mr. Jones).    Otherwise, the album is great, a beautiful channelling of the 60s R&B style with Amy's sense of loss in her own love life.
B0001HAISG|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for P.J. Hogan's live-action version of \\"Peter Pan,\\" I wondered if Hollywood was just trying to cash in on a classic children's tale with a slap-dash, by-the-numbers studio concoction.  You know the kind - all sizzle, with little \\"modern\\" jokes of the moment thrown in, but essentially a grab for a quick buck at the expense of a famous title that will surely bring some parents and their kids into the multiplex.    Then I saw the movie.  I was wrong.     If P.J. Hogan and his team had any ulterior motive, it must have been to redeem J.M. Barrie's classic tale from the horrendous \\"update\\" it received with Steven Spielberg's magnum goof, \\"Hook.\\"  This is a film adaptation that remains true to Barrie's story, which is only one of the great children's stories of all time.    The Darling family lives in Victorian London, where Father toils as a banker and is afraid of his own shadow.  His glorious wife Mary appreciates his sacrifices, but his three children, Wendy, John, and Michael, do not.  For they are in that great pre-adolescent stage where they can thrill each other with stories of swordfights, pirates, and Napoleon, but are still ignorant of the horrors such things actually are.  To them, Father is a colossal bore who, worst of all, only wants them to grow up.    Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is the eldest, and even though she is a budding young woman, she lives for adventure.  And so it is with a grateful smile and a flirtatious gleam that she greets Peter Pan, who flies into their room one night.  With a little coaxing and some fairy dust from a begrudging Tinkerbell, Wendy, John and Michael fly through the night sky to Neverland, leaving their mother to sit by the bedroom window waiting anxiously for their return.    Once in Neverland, Peter introduces the Darlings to the Lost Boys, and Wendy becomes their mother.  All kinds of adventures ensue, including meeting Indians (much less stereotyped than in the Disney version), mermaids, and doing battle with fearsome pirates and their dastardly leader, Captain Hook (Jason Isaacs, doing dual duty as Mr. Darling).    All adventures aside, \\"Peter Pan\\" is a paean to lost youth and how everybody must grow up . . . except Peter Pan.  Hogan and his team are faithful to the book in that Pan's perpetual adolescence is charming, but it is also just a bit sad.  Peter hates the idea of growing up, and he fears it, but he also has feelings for Wendy that he can't pursue if Wendy is allowed to grow up.  And Wendy has feelings for Peter, but she can't pursue them if he won't grow up.  This is complex stuff, but Barrie's story and Hogan's adaptation deal with it effortlessly.    Astounding visual effects remind us that, as good as Pixar and other animators are these days, live action films still have an \\"A\\" game when it comes to visual thrills.  The crocodile that hungers after Hook is frightening, and Neverland has never looked so good.  Isaacs is also perfectly sinister as Hook, and Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as Peter.      All in all, this movie goes on the top shelf of superb family films.  The only version of this story that can top it is sitting with your kids and reading them the stories of Peter Pan together.

B00005JKJA|5.0|First of all, this is David Lynch's masterpiece. This was the culmination of a career that saw uneven brilliance such as \\"Wild at Heart\\", and came before he tumbled into idiocy (\\"Inland Empire\\"). As it stands, this film is clearly one of the greatest films of all time (though not better than \\"Les Enfants du Paradis\\", my favorite film per se).<br /><br />This review is to give you an idea of what the film and DVD are about, not to explain the story to you. The film is a multi-dimensional one, with parallel stories going on at one time. If you like surreal, dark and moody films with a film-noir touch, you'll love this. However, don't go in expecting to understand it all at once. You probably won't, and thats quite normal. The beauty of this movie is that yes, you will end it quite confused and wondering if anything made sense, but what I really like is that you can have multiple explanations as to what actually is going on, and ALL of these explanations will be quite valid.<br /><br />Naomi Watts stars in the best performance of her career - never has the actress been more luminous (not even in her 'well-lit' scenes in 'King Kong'), and she shares screen time with another breakout star, Justin Theroux, who comes into his own in a brilliant performance here. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, and the soundtrack is exceptional.<br /><br />Rarely do you come across a film that can break across divides and appeal to you intelligence and finer qualities. \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is that and more. At once classy and sophisticated, and on the other sinister and morbid, this film has elements of all aspects of human nature, which give it a timeless sheen that only gets better with repeated viewing. Take it from me, I've seen this at least twelve times in the last few years, and always feel like I have more to learn about it.<br /><br />Get this if you like movies in your collection that you want to watch again. And Five Stars for both Justin Theroux and David Lynch.<br /><br />On the flipside, this DVD has no chapter-stops, so you need to manually fast-foward to get where you want to for a particular scene. This has never bothered me as I watch the whole thing in a go each time I pop it in. Others have found this an issue, but I recommend that you look beyond this minor flaw and purchase this anyway.er-stops, so you need to manually fast-foward to get where you want to for a particular scene.

The story sinks into your brain and begs you to listen for just a bit longer- just until the next twist or dramatic reveal!

B0001611DI|5.0|George Romero can rest assured that his zombie classic will not become dated over time, despite advances in special effects, cinematography, and makeup because Dawn of the Dead is in a league of its own in terms of story, characterization, themes, and overall ambience.    The success of Romero's \\"Dead\\" films lies in an often duplicated trait of horror films: isolation.  It's something that Romero has mastered to a tee.  While seemingly simple, the concept of keeping the characters in an abandoned shopping mall with a bunch of zombies creates a slight fear among its viewers, whether your watching it at home or in a theater.  It's been repeated time and again, but Romero's ability to isolate his characters is a hallmark of his films.    Romero's characters are also more complex than those in a basic horror film.  While traditional horror films have characters suffer from pure stupidity, Romero is more interested in human instincts and characters succumbing to their own vices or even their own primal urges.  This is found in the way the survivors decide to not only explore, but get more than they need in the shopping mall.    Besides being a wonderful horror film, however, it's so much more, as other viewers have noted.  I think no other horror film addresses the concept of consumerism, down to the point of comparing shoppers to zombies.  The film's finale is riddled with irony - and you might even be granted a smirk here and there.    As for its timelessness, beyond the film's themes, Romero has created a film that, even if effects don't date well (and they actually do pretty well, especially for the time, gotta love Savini),  feels terrifying.  I think being trapped in a store is one of those nightmares everyone has.  This film may be the reason why.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|this movie was not quite what i expected, but it was reviewed very highly, so i bought it on Blu-Ray and gave it a shot. it turned out to be a very entertaining movie with many funny scenes and some awesome fight scenes. the audio in this movie will light up your surround sound like nothing you have heard before!

B000NVIXFK|2.0|Well . . . what can positively be said about Rush's latest effort? Not too much. Approaching this album from a technical standard their production is once again crisp and clean and the right balance of instrument-to-vocal mixing has been achieved. Although Geddy's vocals are still a tad bit too washed out into the background, it is still a vast improvement from their Vapor Trails disaster. But that's about where the compliments end for Snakes and Arrows. Once again (since Counterparts) we have an album with too much emphasis on band members trying too prove too hard that they can still \\"rock out\\". Overpowering beat-drives and flat, sour songs blanket this entire album. Don't get me wrong, there are some great - but all too brief - moments where you hear the younger progressive Neil Peart of the past tanning his skins along with almost hopeful moments that Geddy's singing will break out into a nice melodic chorus but alas, there is nothing here by the album's end. Essential \\"Rush\\" vitals are yet again missing on this latest effort. Gone are the days of keyboards and the melodic power ballads that marked Rush's climb to the top of their game and peaking in the late 80s into the very early 90s.    Something has been lost along the way since albums like Presto and Roll the Bones. With the exception of a couple of nice songs on Counterparts and Test for Echo, there's no \\"Rush\\" impact here anymore. No \\"Rush\\" magic - no sunshine. There's none of that special something that Rush used to bring to the table no matter what new avenue of musical styles they progressed to. Trying too hard to be like today's rock groups is the key here, I think. In fact, I'd bet my soul on it. The members of Rush will be the first to admit  to you that they have always been a bit of a sponge to whatever sound is current. But by soaking up the sound of today's stagnant and recycled rock bands (tell me most of the songs from a rock band today doesn't sound EXACTLY like the songs from a rock band over 10 years ago!) they have finally lost what they do best. Being Rush.    Peart's lyrics on this album are once again self-indulgent and he's obviously still trying to work out his tragic losses of the past and trying to find and reinvent himself while on the road. Gone the way of the dinosaur is lyrical writing by Peart with subjects and themes of a more universal nature that everyone can relate too and also what made Rush so special. That used to be their trademark. But most importantly, the melodic song writing (and singing) are absent once again on this album. And Geddy? Please stop your yodeling over some of the notes you sing. It was never your strong point and there's far too much of it, now. Especially in light of the fact that you're probably doing it to make up for all the non-melodic songs you are singing these days. It's a terrible surrogate and it makes this fan's teeth itch.    But I will say this . . . There is one strong point to the album and that is Alex's guitar playing. Boy, has he really evolved. He just keeps getting better and better. It's ironic that the one person who had to take a back seat to major keyboard productions throughout most of the 80s is now the man who should lead the way in the direction in which Rush should (hell, NEEDS) to go. His work at the beginning of the song, \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" and especially his short but beautiful instrumental, \\"Hope\\" are ONLY TWO prime examples.    Rush has always been an evolving rock band. It's what has made Rush so great and is what has made a hard-core fan out of me over the long years and, believe me, I hate to critique them in such a negative light as this review of their latest album. But enough is enough. To me this is strike three. Since the boys are - while still evolving in their styles of playing - returning to their rock roots it would be nice to see them now return (while still evolving) to the days of at least SOME keyboards again (hey, you have to have them anyway to perform your now older songs in concert so you might as well keep using them in the studio) and especially to the more melodic song writing that defined the pinnacle of Rush's career. King Lurxst seems to be the only one who wishes to write somewhat melodic music these days.    Alex, it looks like it's up to you. Lead your gang from Willowdale back into the light.    \\"All hail the King!\\"
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I would have to say that overall I consider United Abominations a good album but not great.  I love the fact that Mustaine is making a serious effort to return to his 80's thrash roots.  For the most part the album is pure heavy metal and avoids the progressive sound they had from the mid to late 90's.      There are numerous strengths for this album.  The production is great and the band plays suprisingly tight for not having been together long.  Glen Drover is a fantastic lead guitarist.  Shawn Drover is no Gar Samuelson or Nick Menza, but he holds his own well enough on drums.  There are no really bad songs on this album and the remake of A Toute Le Monde is surprisingly good... normally I don't like those lightweight songs but that one has really grown on me.      There are not many weaknesses to this album but they should be noted.  I would say one of the main weaknesses to me is a lack of a \\"classic\\" track, such as Peace Sells or Hangar 18.  There are some very good songs on this album such as Sleepwalker and Gears of War but I would not put those songs in the same category as My Last Words or Tornado of Souls.  Also, there is a lack of very speedy songs.  Most songs are heavy, but the album is mostly mid-paced.  I am a fan of the 80's Deth sound so sometimes I want them to really go balls out but it usually does not happen here.  Another problem is that the album is a little too political, even by Mustaine's standards.  Some of these songs are too centered around current events and will probably sound dated in ten years.  When he does political songs it would be smarter to keep them more abstract, such as Peace Sells or Holy Wars.    I do not want to sound too negative though, this is a strong album, some of the best metal to come out this year.  United Abominations is Mustaine's true comeback, NOT The System Has Failed.    Highlights: Sleepwalker, Washington is Next!, Never Walk Alone, Gears of War, A Toute Le Monde, You're Dead!    Lowlights: Blessed Are the Dead, Play For Blood, Amerikhastan
B00000DWPH|5.0|Before we begin, a little story for you. Back about two years ago, I WAS this album. My friend exposed me to Tull through Aqualung, and he turned me into a Jethro addict: both this and Aqualung were favorites on my iPod. Then my iPod crashed, and I was left without a copy of Brick. In the time between then and now, I developed some nasty anti-prog biases that I cured myself of with constant listening to Yes, ELP, King Crimson, and Genesis. During that time, however, I would take as many swipes at TAAB as I could. I recently bought my first CD copy of it, to see if my insults still had ground. And it turns out I was wrong all that time: it sounds as phenomenal as it did when I first heard it two years ago.<br />I find it rather ironic that this absolute watershed of the progressive movement is really a parody of the genre and everything it stands for. And not just a parody, but an absolutely hilarious swipe at progressive lyrical content. Let it be known that I like progressive rock, but the fact is it takes itself very seriously. I think that Ian took one look at this and thought, \\"why are all these people confusing density with depth?\\", which explains the constant references to your \\"poets\\" and \\"wise men\\". Anyway, the lyrics are by turns disarmingly hilarious and quite insightful jabs at \\"over-intellectualism\\", and extremely poetic in their own right.<br />But the lyrics are only part of what makes this so amazing. Musically speaking, they cover a lot of ground: some folk, some hard rock, some jazz, some classical (I love those strings near the end!), and even a little bit of avant-garde. There's a lot of balance here - Anderson's flute, Barre's guitar, Evans' keyboards, and Barlow's drums all get about equal time. The bass kind of falls by the wayside, sadly, but hey.<br />My favorite sections of this piece are as follows: the famous opening; the \\"Come all ye childhood heroes\\", section, the \\"Do you believe in the day\\" part where it converts into dark English folk (that's my favorite, period!), and the \\"Let me help you to pick up your dead\\" section, as well as the numerous instrumental passages. But in truth, there's not a single moment of the original album I dislike.<br />Now, let's briefly discuss the bonus track found on some editions, a live version of the piece. I am not a big fan of it: it's condensed into a ten-minute crowd-pleaser that omits multiple segments, ignores everything from side two other than the brief reprise of the main theme, wipes out those little instrumental passages that give it a lot of flavor in the first place, eschews all notion of \\"balance\\" (most of it's devoted to Barre), and features very little of Anderson's flute, which is obviously the biggest thing that set these guys apart in the first place. I can see why it was included, but the fact is it doesn't translate well into a live document.<br />So I say forget the live bonus track, and pick this up if you're missing it. You may love it, you may hate it, but don't ignore it.favorite, period!), and the \\"Let me help you to pick up your dead\\" section, as well as the numerous instrumental passages.

B000JCETC4|3.0|While nice to have a copy of this DVD (as indeed it is always enjoyable to own anything featuring Gilmour) the quality here is rather suspect in places (to put it mildly). The opening track from the forthcoming \\"Remember That Night\\" collection (\\"Take a Breath\\") is very grainy, with unacceptable levels of picture noise.  Having been at the HD launch at the Odeon Leicester Square, London a couple of weeks ago, I am pleased to say that the final version is infinitely sharper.  The Abbey Road take of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is VG - and was not among the tracks broadcast by Channel 4 in the UK from that session.  Both picture and sound quality are by far the best on this disk. The AOL sessions are frankly disappointing.  The picture quality is lamentable - being no better than average streaming quality and showing judder and re-fresh lag on my 100Hz system. If you already have the CD (which I have had since the original release date)  I'd save your money if I were you and put it towards the \\"Remember That Night\\" collection - which, from what I have seen thus far, is vastly superior and more representative of David's normal attention to detail and James Guthrie's exemplary sound mastering. A DVD for completists only!
057121200X|5.0|When Hanif Kureishi's Intimacy was published last year in Britain, it ignited a firestorm in both Kureishi's family and in the press, with one of its many critics denouncing it as \\"this short, odious book.\\" And it's true that Intimacy's narrator, Jay (a scriptwriter) is wilful, childish, narcissistic and wild. And, yes, odious too; he even does the occasional parent-teacher interview in his \\"latest favourite suit, on acid\\" and keeps--even though he's the father of very young children--ecstasy, LSD, and an old bottle of amyl nitrate in the fridge. But he's also a man who is tender, introspective, witty, and exuberantly honest. Herein lies the book's reckless charm and elating momentum.    Intimacy also joins a long line of 20th-century novels that tell the story of men leaving home, beginning with the husband in John Updike's Too Far to Go, a man who--before leaving his wife and children--repairs hinges and latches: \\"a Houdini making things snug before his escape...\\" In novels by Richard Stern and Bernard Malamud and any number of other writers on the theme of men who are also ambivalently on the run, the women being left behind are (like the wives in Updike's fiction) dark-haired, enduring, and sexually withholding, while the mistresses are fair-haired, adoring, and quick to offer sexual comfort. The blondes also travel with a vast array of cosmetic and herbal supplies; in the case of Jay's Nina--a shrewdly wistful phantom forever kept off-stage in her pale, hippie clothes--it's a bag stocked with nipple cream, tapes of the sound of the sea, postcards of cats, packets of camomile tea, and other bits of the equipment so vital to \\"mobile girls.\\"    \\"Soon we will be like strangers,\\" Jay tells us, speaking of Susan, the mother of his children. But no, they can never be that. \\"Hurting someone is an act of reluctant intimacy. We will be dangerous acquaintances with a history.\\" Jay also fears dying--he's invited to more funerals than dinner parties--and so has little use for women who are also too quickly growing older, as he jauntily makes clear when he ironically asks what's wrong with maturity. \\"Think of the conversations I could have--about literature and bitterness--with a forty-year-old!\\"     Susan belongs in this age range, but in spite of his making her his muse by turning her (via metaphor) into a blank page--she's at the bottom of the stairs in her white T-shirt and white slippers, looking \\"so white I could write on her\\"--his evocations of her can also convey his love for her, as in the following scene when he's moved by her enthusiasm as she kisses their children: \\"When we really talk, it is about them, something they have said or done, as if they are a passion no one else can share or understand.\\"    During his last night with his family, Jay experiences the outside world as both ominous and alluring. But mostly ominous: \\"Outside, the dark leaves on the trees flap in the wind like hundreds of long green tongues, the branches knocking at me.\\" He dreads leaving his sons, two \\"fierce and ebullient\\" little boys who are never named--this is one of Kureishi's brilliant strokes--two wild boys who careen through the novel, adding to both its anguish and its comedy. Jay says of the three-year-old, \\"I wonder when I will sleep beside him again, if ever. He has a vicious kick and a tendency, at unexpected moments, to vomit in my hair. But he can pat and stroke my face like a lover. His affectionate words and little voice are God's breath to me.\\" This has a parent's narcissism in it, true, but it's also incredibly tender. And yet in the skilfully abridged version of Intimacy that appeared last summer in The New Yorker, a few lines down from this adoring tribute Jay is on the threshold of his front door, the fresh wind sweeping through him as one of the more compelling of his inner voices commands, \\"Go. You must go.\\"     This is where the novel should have ended, on page 92. It would have been a novella then, but it would have been theright thing to keep it emotionally and lyrically dynamic. Instead it goes on for another twenty-six pages, and the line that follows the powerful \\"Go. You must go,\\" is almost criminally banal: \\"I am kicking over the traces.\\" Along with a few other lacklustre passages, this is one of the relatively few disappointments in what is otherwise a vivid and fearless novel. The good bits in the final pages could also have been spliced in earlier. At times it's also as if the war between Jay's id and his superego has triggered a war in the syntax, which is sometimes formal and Victorian, sometimes the Kiplingesque English of Jay's father, sometimes London street slang.     But whatever its deficiencies, Intimacy is an important and weirdly thrilling book, reminding us (as we occasionally do need reminding) how honourable that other war is: the war between what's most \\"worthy\\" and what's most alive.    *******************************************************************  This review first appeared in The Globe and Mail
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Not done on a huge blockbuster budget, Children of Men looks and feels like a much more expensive film than it actually is and looks expecially great in HD with a great use of colors (greens of wet grass and greys of decaying buildings) and shadows to exude a future with which we are very familiar.  Not delving into the politics behind the plot (though these are examined in depth in the DVD extras) the film focuses instead on its characters and specificly Clive Owen's character and the pregnant girl who become a Mary and Joseph proxy as the film progresses.  Children of Men is not an action film but I felt it moved along at a proper pace as opposed to those reviewers who found it slow and tedious...we need the time the film gives to character development to understand the conflicts taking place all around the main players...  One of my only complaints about the film is a common one amongst those portraying the \\"future\\"...Why can't anyone get the cars of the future right??  As one of the most telling objects in any film these days, the automobile tells the viewer so much about the world we are watching, why do directors allow them to appear to be Minivans covered with plywood and aluminum sheeting?  Its cheap, lazy, and irritating...
0312305060|4.0|\\"Here, then, is the world (house, sky, a first tentative star)...\\" These words are not the words of Virginia Woolf, although readers could certainly be forgiven for thinking so, they so accurately catch her idiosyncratic cadence and her offhand thrilling shimmer; they are the words of an invented Woolf in The Hours--\\"The Hours\\" was Woolf's working title for Mrs. Dalloway--a novel in which the American writer Michael Cunningham imagines several episodes in Woolf's life over the course of a single day in 1923 (the year she was writing Mrs. Dalloway). He then sets these episodes against a single day in the life of a young married woman and her little boy in California in 1949 and, in alternating chapters, against a day in the life of a middle-aged New York editor and her (gay) circle of friends at the end of the twentieth century.     He also invents the afternoon of Woolf's suicide: \\"She hurries from the house wearing a coat too heavy for the weather. It is 1941. Another war has begun.\\" But even on the way to her own drowning, the writer in Virginia (and the writer was all of her) is distracted by \\"a scattering of sheep, incandescent, tinged with a faint hint of sulphur...\\"    How accurate Cunningham's evocation of her subsequent drowning is we can never know, but it feels inspired and terrible, and there is even, at the heart of it, the kind of mad glee of a children's book: \\"She appears to be flying, a fantastic figure, arms outstretched, hair streaming, the tail of the fur coat billowing behind...\\"    A mother and her little boy, walking across a nearby bridge, just narrowly miss catching sight of her. They foreshadow another mother and little boy living in Los Angeles in 1949. Laura Brown (the other mother) is longing to stay in bed so she can finish reading Mrs. Dalloway--she reaches for it automatically \\"as if reading were the singular and obvious first task of the day, the only viable way to negotiate the transit from sleep to obligation\\"--but she forces herself to get up and have breakfast with her husband (who, when he takes a bath, boyishly floats in the tub, his \\"sex shrunk to a stub\\") along with their son Richie who makes her think \\"of a mouse singing amorous ballads under the window of a giantess.\\"    Laura Brown later escapes to a hotel room for an illicit afternoon with her book, an escape that parallels Virginia's earlier attempt to escape suburban Richmond for the psychic dangers of London. But then there are so many parallels: Richie will grow up to be called Richard (the first name of Mr. Dalloway) and before he comes to accept the fact that he's gay he'll have an affair with a girl named Clarissa Vaughan (but the fact that her first name is Clarissa will lead Richard to call her Mrs. Dalloway) and Vanessa Bell will come to tea with Virginia, and Vanessa's children will find a dead bird in the Woolf garden and circle it with roses so that Virginia, looking down at its \\"modest circlet of thorns and flowers\\" will think, \\"It could be a kind of hat. It could be the missing link between millinery and death.\\" Years later, back in New York City, Clarissa (the other Clarissa), on her way to buy flowers for a party for Richard--he's dying and is about to receive a major literary prize--will spot a famous face peeking out of a movie trailer and wonder if it belongs to Vanessa Redgrave (not only another Vanessa, but also the actress who played Clarissa in the movie version of Mrs. Dalloway).     There are non-Woolfian allusions as well: Clarissa Vaughan leaves a copy of Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook on her nightstand, and at Laura Brown's hotel the desk clerk gives her the key to Room 19 (\\"To Room 19\\" being the title of one of Lessing's most anthologized stories) and the writer in The Golden Notebook is another sort of Woolf (Anna Wulf) and later still, Clarissa Vaughan concludes that Lessing has long been overshadowed by other writers. All of this might sound just too postmodernly coy for words, but in fact Cunningham is playing--just as Woolf did--not only with time and ideas about time, but also with ideas about how much we are not only part of one another but also ghosts of one another. He also quotes the part of Mrs. Dalloway in which Clarissa sees herself as part, \\"she was positive, of the trees at home; of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was; part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself.\\"     Even the typography of The Hours supports these death-in-life and life-beyond-death intensities via the ghostly aura given to the chapter headings, making use of the pale-grey names of the characters whose chapter it isn't to flank the name (in bold type) of the character whose chapter it is. But is this evocative and tender novel derivative? Only in the sense that it couldn't have been written if Mrs. Dalloway hadn't been written first; except for a very brief flat patch in the middle and a ho-hum ending, it's too inspired to ride on Woolf's coat tails. Its buoyant precision also catches Woolf's clarity and comedy, along with her clear-eyed ability to be critical of herself and her work. It's also an extremely intelligent novel that ends up feeling like an extended riff by a gifted jazz musician on the work of a genius of a classical composer: with its complex arrangements of literary reverberations and its memorable descriptions of regret and civilised squalor, with a woman's straw sandals making a \\"small, crisp sound when she walks\\" and \\"decapitated flowers floating in bowls of water\\", it has its own marvels.    And yet the movie made from this often fascinating book was pretty awful, in spite of the brilliant casting of Nicole Kidman to play Woolf (she was a revelation). Most of the other actors were extraordinary too. So was it the script? The direction? That turned it into a period piece that was also a soap opera? I can't remember it well enough at this point to hazard a guess.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\", the 2007 very deserving Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Film is IMO, the best film of last year regardless of the country it was made in. It took its writer/director several years first to thoroughly research still very painful events of the recent German history, the ones that deal with infamous and evil STASI (State Secret Police) and how it infiltrated and affected almost every aspect of GDR life. Before the collapse of the Soviet system and its most ominous and infamous symbol, the wall in the end of the 80s, life in East Germany of 1984 had imitated art precisely like in the prophetic and terrifying George Orwell's novel. Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was \\"Shield and Sword of the Party\\" and its goal, \\"To know everything\\". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.<br /><br />I was shocked to find out that such astounding movie was a directorial debut of 33 years old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - so artistically impeccable this honest, human, horrifying, harrowing yet hopeful film is. The film makers had recreated successfully and precisely the 1980s with its dark suffocating atmosphere of constant abuse of individual privacy in the former German Democratic republic. The locations, the huge dominating gray apartment buildings of the big city where every wall seems to have the ears and the eyes , the old cars on the streets of East Berlin - everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically . As great as \\"The Lives of Others is\\", it would not have been the same without Ulrich M&uuml;he, as Captain Gerd Wiesler, a highly skilled and efficient STASI officer and a loyal member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who spies on successful playwright and his actress girlfriend by the order of corrupted hypocritical member of the government. While listening to the Lives of Others, Wiesler's own life would change in the way he had never expected.<br /><br />Once you start watching the movie, you'll see how Ulrich M&uuml;he effortlessly over towers every other performance on the screen, and they are all excellent. The real life of Ulrich M&uuml;he could make a great and compelling movie and the script for \\"The Lives of Others\\" was written with him in mind. He was born, grew up, and became a famous actor in the Eastern Germany back in the late 70s of the last century. By the words of von Donnersmarck, STASI began spying on M&uuml;he right after he had graduated from High School because STASI realized that he would be great even before he himself realized that. After German reunification, M&uuml;he discovered evidence in his STASI file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theater, but also by his second wife, Jenny Gr&ouml;llmann. This was denied by Gr&ouml;llmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent M&uuml;he from repeating the allegation in a book. M&uuml;he's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was simple, \\"I remembered\\". M&uuml;he passed away few months ago, in July 2007 due to stomach cancer at the age or 54, and when I read it, I felt emptiness - like a very good close friend has gone forever. His performance in the film \\"The Lives of Others\\" will live always as one of the best and most memorable given by any actor of the screen.
006085880X|1.0|This is the fourth book by this author that I have read and I must say it will be the last.

Enough.
0143038583|5.0|This is the most basic culinary detective book. In modern America, Michael Pollan wonders what to eat: \\"... imagine for a moment if we once again knew, strictly as a matter of course, these few unremarkable things: What it is we're eating. Where it came from. How it found it's way to our table. And what, in a true accounting, it really cost.\\"<br /><br />Of course most North Americans can't answer these questions in any self-satisfying way, so Pollan sets off on the case. He journeys through the belly of the food industry beast -- to the massive government-subsidized corn plantations of Iowa, the huge cattle feed lots and the slaughterhouses. He visits the plants where trainload after trainload of corn is refined into the chemical components of processed food, and then he takes his family to McDonalds.<br /><br />Searching for alternatives to totally explore, Pollan visits large-scale organic plantations. He works for a spell on an organic family farm in Virginia, helping to slaughter the chickens for his next gourmet meal. And last he goes whole hog back to the hunter-gatherer days, searching for mushrooms and shooting a wild pig in the forests of Northern California.<br /><br />The whole experience yields tons of great stories, and the kind of good common sense I can't resist quoting:<br /><br />\\"A tension has always existed between the capitalist imperative to maximise efficiency at any cost and the moral imperatives of culture, which have historically served as a counterweight to the moral blindness of the market. This is another example of the cultural contradictions of capitalism -- the tendency over time for the economic impulse to erode the moral underpinnings of society.\\" (p. 318)<br /><br />But aside from the politics of soil and animal abuse, Pollan ends up with some damn fine meals, eaten with friends he makes along the way:<br /><br />\\"Was the perfect meal the one you made all by yourself? Not necessarily; certainly this one wasn't that. Though I had spent the day in the kitchen (a good part of the week as well), and I had made most everything from scratch and paid scarcely a dime for the ingredients, it had taken many hands to bring this meal to the table. The fact that just about all those hands were at the table was the more rare and important thing, as was the fact that every single story about the food on the table could be told in the first person.\\" (p. 409)week as well), and I had made most everything from scratch and paid scarcely a dime for the ingredients, it had taken many hands to bring this meal to the table.

B000LXH0AE|1.0|Imagine my surprise when a SONY DVD will not play in my SONY (DVP-CX995V) DVD player. It actually caused my Player to auto shut off!  Assuming a bad disc I returned the original only to have the same problem.  A 30 second web search confirmed that Sony used this DVD as a guinea pig to introduce their latest copy protection scheme.  Another 30 second search turned up three programs already in place that will defeat it.  When will these companies learn?  Aren't they aware that those of us that DON'T steal are totally disgusted with being forced to watch their moronic anti-piracy \\"previews\\"?  And aren't they aware that anyone that is inclined to make copies could not possibly care less about the tricks they put on the discs?  BTW.  The movie was pretty good but I was so disgusted with Sony I didn't enjoy it very much.

But if your still  a little hesitant, when it comes out just rent it and make up your own mind.
0312330871|5.0|I don't see how anyone who relishes a quality 'whodunit' could fail to love this book (even though a few Amazon reviews below show that it is the case).  I am familiar with quite a number of Agatha Christies (including classics like Roger Ackroyd & Orient Express, etc.), and this one clearly takes the prize.  Everything about it is delicious:  the inescapable island setting, the strange circumstances, the unfolding pattern, and the overall feeling of a growing and inevitable horror.  Most excellent of all is the plot, which is brilliantly conceived and executed.  And at the end of the day, the author has played fair (I'll make one complaint below).  What more do you want?!<br /><br />There are only two (mostly minor) criticisms I would make.  IMO, the first keeps this story from being the perfect murder mystery.  Namely, there is an early scene in which the killer THINKS a deceptive thought (I won't type it here and ruin the story for any prospective reader), and the reader reads it.  This is an unfair slip on Agatha's part.  Sure enough the murderer might indeed SPEAK such a deceptive sentence, but to have him/her THINK it silently (and then have the reader simply read it at face value) -- I felt this was stretching credibility too far.  For a perfectionist like me, it is a pity that it's in the text, and if only it could be excised!  Secondly (and AC probably had no control over this), I prefer the British title of the book - Ten Little Indians - over the American and more popular one, which sort of anticipates and gives away too much (albeit subtly).  Admittedly not a huge issue, just a quibble.<br /><br />At any rate, mystery lovers you're in for a treat.  Enjoy and savor the Grand Dame at her finest!

B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles's first album, Please Please Me, sure did do a whole lot more than just pleasing people. Listening to the album remains an emotionally charged experience; and people instinctively knew from the start that a great star was born in a band called The Beatles. The sound is great on this CD; and we get plenty of early tunes from the best of the best!<br /><br />The track set begins with the rockin' hard number \\"I Saw Here Standing There.\\" The Beatles belt this one straight out of the ball park for a mammoth grand slam! The electric guitars, the percussion, the drums and voices of these young musicians create an exciting number that you will remember for a long time to come. Awesome jamming on \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" too. \\"Chains\\" features some really good harmonica at the beginning; and they harmonize well as the guitars, drums and percussion carry the bulk of the musical arrangement. The Beatles's cover of \\"Chains\\" really rocks; and the slightly increased tempo they use enhances the ballad even further. Great!<br /><br />\\"Boys\\" gives us another early number that the band covered; and they make \\"Boys\\" all their own with their awesome natural style and creativity! Good harmony and a few subtle key changes make \\"Boys\\" an even stronger number. \\"Please Please Me\\" also uses harmonica with the guitars and drums to make the melody strong; and they sing great of how they want romantic time alone with their sweethearts. Moreover, \\"Love Me Do\\" mixes rock with a twist a country to create a strong ballad about love; and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" uses awesome percussion to inject a slightly Latin flavor into the melody. They sing passionately with all their heart and soul.<br /><br />\\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\" gives us a great early Lennon/McCartney song about the joys of a young love blossoming; and the CD ends strong with \\"Twist And Shout.\\" The Twist was still relatively hot at that time; and The Beatles manage very well to blend rock with a slight twist flavor to it--the arrangement rocks! The Beatles sing this to perfection; and the guitars, percussion and drums enhance \\"Twist And Shout\\" greatly.<br /><br />The liner notes include great artwork and the song credits. Tony Barrow adds a good essay about The Beatles and this album.<br /><br />The Beatle's first album was nothing to sneeze at--just one listen at this track set amply proves it all. We are all better off for The Beatles sharing their singularly beautiful talents with us; and it goes without saying that their music will remain available to people everywhere for ages to come.<br /><br />Thank you, Beatles!he Beatles sing this to perfection; and the guitars, percussion and drums enhance \\"Twist And Shout\\" greatly.

B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles remain the greatest rock band to ever walk the Earth; and this album entitled Rubber Soul proves their remarkable creativity as well. The sound is quite good and we get the full fourteen songs that were on the British version of this album. Great!<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"Drive My Car.\\" The Beatles use the imagery of driving a car to describe making love. The percussion, guitars, drums and piano all enhance this number which rocks well. Awesome tune! \\"Drive My Car\\" is arguably one of The Beatles's greatest hits ever; and the band jams really well on \\"Drive My Car,\\" too.<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" features Paul McCartney singing at his very best; and when John comes in this number takes off like a jet! The guitars work wonders for the arrangement and I predict you will like \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" very, very much. \\"You Won't See Me\\" is a great rock ballad that feels a bit like pop in retrospect but it still rocks nicely; and \\"Nowhere Man\\" remains another Beatles classic. \\"Nowhere Man\\" features the band members singing of a man who is lost; he's not exactly experiencing life to the fullest. He may be on drugs; but this is not clearly stated in the lyrics. The Beatles deliver \\"Nowhere Man\\" like the angelic pros that they were.<br /><br />\\"Michelle\\" gives us another Beatles masterpiece. Paul sings this with great sensitivity, passion and a certain degree of panache I rarely hear or enjoy. Many singers have covered \\"Michelle\\" as this ballad also fits into the easy listening category; but no one ever did it as well as this band did it. \\"Michelle\\" showcases The Beatles's fine ability to put out a truly romantic, timeless love ballad. Wonderful! In addition, \\"In My Life\\" is another thoughtful, pensive love ballad; The Beatles sing of how constant their love for their women remains even though times change and friends come into and go out of their lives. The key changes enhance the natural beauty of \\"In My Life;\\" the percussion, drums and piano work wonders for the arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Wait\\" starts off with a strong minor key as The Beatles sing of a man who returns to his lover hoping that they can rekindle their love after a bad breakup. \\"Wait\\" sports a great melody; and I think this is another highlight of this album. Moreover, \\"Run For Your Life\\" uses some great guitars as they sing of how a man wants revenge from his lover if she has been untrue to him. Great percussion, too!<br /><br />The liner notes feature some black and white photos of The Beatles; and we get the song credits. The cover artwork impresses me greatly.<br /><br />The Beatles can never be forgotten. They produced a sound unlike any band before or after them ever did. Their harmonies, the lyrics to their songs, and their thoughtfulness about life and relationships permeate every number they ever wrote or sang. I highly recommend this album for Beatles fans; and anyone who appreciates good classic rock will hold onto this album for ages to come.<br /><br />Awesome work--thank you, guys!and piano work wonders for the arrangement.     \\"Wait\\" starts off with a strong minor key as The Beatles sing of a man who returns to his lover hoping that they can rekindle their love after a bad breakup. \\"Wait\\" sports a great melody; and I think this is another highlight of this album.

Many people have compared him to the late Freddie Mercury in both voice and song-writing, which is a great compliment. I have enjoyed this album immensely.

Ayaan Ali continues to tell the truth and fight for her ideals; and even though sometimes the style of this book made me wish for more editing, most of the time I realized that this uneven style makes the book and its message more genuine and potent.

But when he pops into the club for a quick drink before the show, he is kidnapped.<br /><br />When he arrives at a country estate, his kidnappers start calling him George Kaplan.  Roger has no clue who Kaplan is and says so quite forcefully.  Whether they believe him or not, he is forced to drink bourbon and left alone in a car to die.<br /><br />The only problem for them is he survives.  Determined to find out what the heck is going on, he sets out trying to track down Kaplan.  His efforts land him as the prime suspect in a diplomat's murder.<br /><br />With his only lead being a hotel room in Chicago, Roger sets out cross country by train.  It is there he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a beautiful woman with a secret of her own.  Can Roger find the truth?  Maybe, but he will have to face low flying crop dusters and a chase across Mount Rushmore to do it.<br /><br />This is my fourth Hitchcock film, and the first one I enjoyed.  The story starts rather quickly and is confusing enough that it held my interest the entire time.  Yet is also has some very witty banter and a great romance between the two leads.  The acting is superb, easily drawing me into the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it suffers from a common curse of movies from that era, pacing.  While I found parts of it rather gripping, I found the parts on the train dull and slow.  Yes, it was developing character and building the romance.  But I still found my mind starting to wander.<br /><br />I was about to write Hitchcock off entirely, but after this film, maybe I'll give him another chance.  If you are also unfamiliar with the work of this legend, this might be a good place to start.

Arnold is highly entertaining especially when he is playing with Franco Columbu or messing with Lou Ferrigno's head before the big Mr. Olympia showdown.<br /><br />Ferrigno is shown as the up and comer who is pushed repeatedly by his domineering father.  He comes to train for the contest in total awe of Arnold, which makes his father mad and makes him push Lou harder.<br /><br />We also see a very touching scene as the fourth place finisher of the Mr. Universe contest has to deal with disappointment and then listen as his friend is crowned Mr. Universe.  He then talks about what must be going through his friend's mind and that he should go out and shake his hand out of courtesy.<br /><br />Those familar with today's sport would say that these guys were obviously using steroids or some other body enhancing drug but that type of thing is never even hinted at.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|From director Antoine Fuqua who's created such hits as 'Training Day', 'King Arthur', and 'The Replacement Killers', comes 'Shooter', a high action \\"guy\\" flick.<br /><br />Extreme sharp shooter Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is recruited after retirement to aid in foiling the president's assassination.  What he doesn't know is that he's going to be framed for it.  Rookie agent Nick Memphis (Micheal Pena) seems to be the only one who smells fish in this fouled bowl of a coup.  Seems the president wasn't the real target, but an ambassador from Africa with some unknown figures of casualties stemming from the construction of an oil pipeline.<br /><br />Managing to elude the secret service and FBI, Swagger then visits his dead partner's wife Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara) for a little recoup and regroup.  Now he's out to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Look for an excellent performance from Danny Glover as Colonel Isaac Johnson, playing the part of the bad guy.  Also excellent are Rhona Mitra (Hollow Man, Nip/Tuck Season Three) as Alourdes Galindo and Ned Beatty as Senator Charles F. Meachum, another bad guy.<br /><br />There's car chases, blowups, shootouts, homemade IV's, a pretty girl, and all kinds of tense action and puzzling intrigue.  While sticking close to the formula for a \\"guy\\" flick, 'Shooter' manages to entertain all with its edgy atmosphere.  Although, I could have done with more 'Sam the dog' than the patented Mark Wahlbery \\"swagger\\" in slow motion.  There's a decent plotline, a lot of action, and enough good performances to keep this movie from falling into the flatlands of typical \\"guy\\" flicks.  Enjoy!
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|Now, you'll say - what can I possibly get from the HD version of a movie filmed 65 years ago? It's not like they did it on HD and had to go SD due to hardware limitations !    I tell you this - the \\"standard DVD\\" showed a bunch of background as just a blot of black or white - HD recovers all those details. And the close-ups on Bogart's and Bergman's faces are breathtaking.    If you loved it in SD, you'll marry it on HD :)
0618680004|5.0|Whether you believe in God or don't - this book is worth reading.  It's thoughtful and well written.  If you don't have an open mind, don't bother because you won't get past the first few pages.  IF you have an open mind, buy the book.  It will make you think.
B000GTJT0M|5.0|Great movie. Loved the special effects. Gwyneth Paltrow died before the movie and it shows on her acting. Was revived after shooting was done. Jude  Law . . . well, it's Jude Law.  If you like the retro look of the short film, get the movie. Special effects are great. And HD-DVD only makes it better.  Now, if only Blu-Ray would go away . . . ;)
0679411585|5.0|This book is the best reflection of some of my personal experiences in Vietnam that I have read. If one really  wants to truly know what it was like ,read this book. I especially like the fact that Hal Moore is a true soldier's soldier.These kind of leaders are special men and quickly earn the respect of their men. I also liked the fact of his follow up, after coming home, with the familys of the men he lost. The thumnail sketch at the end of the book of each surviving man shows how much he thought of his troops !!
B0009A40ES|3.0|I had to take myself to another place to enjoy this movie.  Lots of unrealistic craziness going on, but I guess that's what it was supposed to be.  What's real and what's not?  I don't know.  Just average to me.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth looks simply amazing on my 1080p LCD. Colors are bright and wonderful. There's a lot of shots from really high up (low flying satellites maybe) where you can see a river flow through half a continent or a delta and it just looks simply amazing. Planet Earth really showcases everything 1080p is all about. It's worth the money too because you get 4 discs for a total of 9.5 hours.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|This was a great buy! I was a little worried about DVDs being sent in the mail, but they are all in great condition!
055358894X|4.0|Trained from childhood as a thief and con-artist par excellence, Locke Lamora employs a silver tongue and quicksilver mind to divest the rich of Camorr of their excessive wealth.  No sooner do Locke and his associates initiate their latest scheme, however, than they find themselves at the mercy of the mysterious Gray King, who intends to use them as pawns in his bid to take over the city-state's underworld.  As the Gray King's diabolical plan unfolds, Locke finds his skills tested as never before as he struggles not only for his own survival, but also for the survival of his friends and Camorr itself.<br /><br />In this scintillating debut novel, Scott Lynch establishes himself as a rising star of fantasy fiction.  Like Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind), Lynch is a natural storyteller with a keen intellect and a gift for richly detailed, imaginative world-building and intricate plotting.  Lies is a fast-paced, entertaining, stilettos- (and hatchets-) against-sorcery tale that is both self-contained and well-positioned as a cornerstone for further adventures.  It does have its share of weaknesses: excessive and gratuitous profanity; good but not deeply developed characterization; a few locales that are either too complex to describe or else inadequately described; and a lack of any comment on the human condition or truth that will change one's life.  In short, it's a tale intended as pure entertainment ... and as such, it admirably succeeds.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of thieves, caper movies, and well-written sword-and-sorcery.  Recommended with a caveat to fans of high fantasy and anyone distasteful of profanity and violence.  Four gleaming white-iron stars.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|This cd might not be better than the first, but to me it's still worth buying.  Some songs don't rock as hard as some of the songs on bedlam. but there are some very good contenders. The stand out tracks being, 1973, Carry you home, I really want You, and I can't hear the music.  This is a great solid cd and you won't regret buying. James' unique voice is worth it.
B00005JPRF|4.0|I LIKED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH.AND CONTRARY TO WHAT THAT REVIEWER SAID ABOUT HER GETTING NAKED SHE DOESNT.EVEN WHEN THEY SHOW A CLONE OF HER ASLEEP SHE HAS HER ARM COVERING HER BREASTS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS DUMB SINCE SHE WASNT LAYING DOWN.THE STORY IS MOVING TOO SLOW I THINK.PROBABLY SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MOVIES.AND I WOULD HAVE RATHER SEEN THE CHARACTERS FROM THE VIDEO GAME.THEY DONT EVEN SHOW JILL VALENTINE AT ALL IN THIS MOVIE.OR CHRIS REDFIELD OR BARRY OR ALBERT WESKER.STILL A VERY GOOD EFFORT AND I WAS NEVER BORED WATCHING IT.IT IS GETTING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS NOW WITH ALL THE POWERS BEING SHOWN HERE.LIKE HER TELEPATHIC ABILITIES TO MOVE THINGS.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Despite the fact that this movie received more attention due to its stars off-screen relationship and most likely destroyed the box-office because of it, there is really no denying that on-screen these two are impeccable together.  Honestly, watching them together is so natural and pleasant that if their home life is anything like their film life then I completely understand why they're together.  They interact so effortlessly together, so naturally and beautifully that it transcends acting altogether.  That really is the biggest draw to `Mr. & Mrs. Smith'.  This is one of those cases where the actors really elevate the body of the film.  `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' has is detractors, but overall this is such a fun film that those faults are easily forgiven.  Angelina Jolie has never been more radiant then she is in this film (I'm telling you, I don't get the Golden Globe `Comedy/Musical' Actress snub at all!!!), and Brad Pitt has never been more charming (some may disagree, but I'm sticking with that statement for the time being).  That coupled with Adam Brody and Vince Vaughn serving up some hilarious supporting performances and you get a well rounded good time.<br /><br />So the movie finds our two stars in a loveless marriage if that is at all believable.  The first scene has them arguing calmly before a marriage councilor.  In a sense they are bored.  They've been married for five or six years and within those years their lives have become so routine, so predictable that they can't stand each other.  What each fails to realize is that their lives are the furthest things from routine, for they really don't know each other at all.  In fact, both John and Jane Smith are assassins working for conflicting agencies, and when they are both hired to assassinate the same target they end up confronted with the truth about each other, and their marriage starts to heat up as they are instructed to take each other out.<br /><br />The film's major detractor is its running length.  While it is only a two hour film and that in itself may not seem like a long time, with a film of the genre it can seem to drag a bit.  I know that seems odd but action films, like comedies, are generally shorter than your dramas and biopics.  By the time you get to the final stretch of `Mr. & Mrs. Smith' you may feel a bit worn out, but it's only a mere few minutes away from the credits so hold in there.  Aside from that minor complaint I really can't say too many bad things about this film.  At times it is a bit clich&eacute;d, but what film isn't these days.  The acting, like I said, really makes up for any and all issues with the film.  Aside from Pitt and Jolie there is Vince Vaughn who is just hysterical here as John's best friend Eddie, and Adam Brody is spot on as Benjamin Danz, a kid who may know more than he's letting on.  I would have loved to see Kerry Washington used a little more than she is.  Her role is really thankless, and she is so very talented.<br /><br />The action sequences are great here, but obviously censored.  The film's original rating was R, at least that's what I had gathered at the time of release, and that significant cuts where made (especially in that already steamy love scene) and I'm sure those cuts inched there way over into some of the violent sequences.  That said, it's not anything too drastic for enjoyment.  The fight/love scene in particular is so breathtakingly done that it is the immediate highlight of the film.  Not that I'm an advocate for spousal abuse (lord knows I'm the farthest thing from) but that particular scene looks like a lot of fun.  Anyways, moving on, the film is entertaining in just about every respect and is more than just a celebrity gossip piece.  So what if this spawned the most widely talked about Hollywood romance in the history of Hollywood romances, that's the furthest thing from the point.  When the dust settles and the paparazzi get their pictures (and those crazy fans get their hugs) we're left with an entertaining, enjoyable and crowd pleasing good time, and that my friends is exactly what we're looking for.and crowd pleasing good time, and that my friends is exactly what we're looking for.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|What can you say about a film that has you smiling from beginning to end? I enjoyed this film immensely. I loved its youthful energy. I loved its message of inclusion of those who don't fit a standard pattern of looks or behavior. I loved the music and especially the dance sequences. And I especially loved the fact that it championed black styles of dance and music without dismissing white styles out of hand.<br /><br />\\"Hairspray\\" is the story of ingenous Tracy Turnblad, a short, heavyish high school student who dreams of dancing on a local TV teen dance show in early 1963. She is opposed by moralists (her friend's mother, Prudy), her protective parents, and the larger culture, represented by the station manager, a former beauty queen who is managing the fortunes of her ownmean, but not-untalented daughter. Traci works through all these obstacles, befriending a detention hall's wortth of talented black students, plotting to enter the dance content and to intergrate Baltimore TV while she is at it.<br /><br />The film hit all the right notes and much of the credit goes to the acting. John Travolta's turn as Edna Turnblad, Tracy's Mom, was too-precious at first, but eventually found its feet. Michelle Pfeiffer was stunning as witchy vampy Velma Von Tussle. Queen Latifah lived up to her name as leader of the the black kids and the host of the TV show's once-a -month \\"Negro Day.\\" The high energy of the fisst half of the film was deliberately tuned down for the more somber 3rd quarter in which characters worked out seeming infidelities and setbacks. But this just set up the explosive last quarter of the film, in which the opoosing forces had their showdown on the dancefloor.<br /><br />Prior to seeing the movie, I knew practically nothing about Hairspray, so I had no expectations about whether it would measure up to the Jon Waters original or the Broadway play. But the film stood on its own. There was little campiness or post-modern irony in the film, which was fine by me, and it got the optimistic tone, the peradoxes and the look of the 1960s just right. The film was as guiless as Tracy herself, and did not try to make cheap points about tacky clothes or furnishings. Even Tracy's dad, played amiably by Christopher Walken, was not played as a snarky wiseguy, but as a man completely dedicated to his silly work (he ran a local jokeshop)and imprevious to even the most tempting of diversions.<br /><br />Hairspray has not a mean bone in its body. It's beside the point that civil rights were not won on the basis of a few sign-carrying kids, one integrated TV show, or that the 1960s were an unlikely time for romance to bloom across racial lines. The larger message was clear: we are all dancers under the skin, and ought to bring the best of what we have, combine it with the best of what others have to give, and produce something to which we can all dance together. We are far from that reality, but works like \\"Hairspray\\" show that sometimes, the naïve dreams of innocents are worth following.istic tone, the peradoxes and the look of the 1960s just right.

0385486804|2.0|The story this book follows is an interesting story, but honestly I couldn't finish the book.  I found that the author spent too much time compareing the kid Chris to himself, which made the book really bland.  I enjoy reading about adventures in the wild, but alot of this book didn't even talk about Chris.  The fact that the kid was so niave wasn't even the problem, it was how far on a pedestool the auther seems to hold his (chris's) ignorance.  I hope the movie turns out better.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Like most Horror fans I am tired of all these PG-13 remakes of horror classics. Death Proof is a breath of fresh air that the movie industry needed, but like all great horror movies it has been pushed under the Hollywood mat, and is very sad. This movie also opened me up to a stuntwoman named Zoe Bell. I would excpect to see alot more of her in the future.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|If somebody really had to die in order for the world to have HAMLET, would it be worth it?  In STRANGER THAN FICTION, an author realizes to her horror that her leading character is a real man leading a real life, and if she kills off his character in her book, he will really die.  If he dies, the book will be a masterpiece.  If she changes the ending so that he lives, the book will only be \\"okay\\".  Which would you choose?      I was surprised by STRANGER THAN FICTION.  I only knew Will Ferrell from the over-the-top performances that are his trademark; I was delighted that he is also capable of a toned-down, thoughtful performance.  Emma Thompson is always great--her reaction when she discovers that her character is real is exactly right.  Dustin Hoffman is excellent as the nice-guy professor with an edge.  He really believes that the book is worth the life of the man standing right in front of him.      STRANGER THAN FICTION is rapidly becoming one of my favorite movies.  I bought it two weeks ago and have watched it three times.  Each time I notice more and more of the subtle touches the director brought to the film.  I highly recommend it to anybody who prefers a little thought with their comedy.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Over the past year Leonardo Dicaprio has become one of my favorite actors. He has totally renewed his image and become pretty hardcore. His role in Blood Diamond may not be as powerful than in The Departed but it was one of the better performances I have seen in a long time. Definately worth a look.
0061120073|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read...it has a great plot and a great setting too. Once I started reading it, i couldn't stop. The characters and problems they face seem so real! I recommend this book for people 13 and up because It does have minor \\"things\\" in it. BEST BOOK EVER!
0783227434|5.0|The last and my personal favorite of the Evil Dead Trilogy. I wish Bruce Campbell would reprise this role someday. Maybe after Bubba Hotep 2,awww we can only hope.
B00003CY6M|1.0|My daughters and I love romantic comedies.  I ordered Serendipity based on the Amazon viewers' reviews.  But, perhaps, I should stop putting so much faith in this method of choosing my video entertainment.    The biggest problem with this movie is that we didn't care whether the two main characters actually got together.  There was not enough time invested up front to make us feel that they had a special relationship and belonged together.  So, later, when they are both engaged to other people, we felt there was no reason not to want them to STAY with those other people (except Lars, her fiance, was a little strange - nothing wrong with HIS fiance).      I couldn't help but think that they were both being real jerks.  They had people who THOUGHT they were loved.  They were about to be married.  Yet they were chasing after what could only have been a fantasy born of a few hours fling.  Ridiculous!    The movie smacked a little of \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" in that, with both, people are about to marry but stop to wonder about someone/something that might have been.  Except, \\"Sleepless\\" IS romantic, and funny, and...wonderful (for us romantic comedity lovers it's one of the best!)  See it again - forget \\"Seren...whatever!\\"
B000LAZDQA|3.0|i'll admit i only bought this movie because of the controversy surrounding the sex scenes. But those graphic scenes aside it actually is a decent movie.<br /><br />Brief summary for those that haven't heard about this. Its a film about sex by the guy that made Hedwig. It follows a gay couple that are thinking about threesomes and a sex therapist that has never had an orgasm. All three end up at \\"the shortbus\\" which is an underground sex club where even voyerism is participation.<br /><br />It's an artsy fartsy movie and since that isn't my style i really wasn't \\"moved\\" like some reviewers have said but i did find it to be a good and entertaining watch. The sex scenes are highly graphic, especially the gay sex scenes. If you aren't a childish homophobe you can get yourself through those few minutes. Oh and the opening sex scenes with the sex therapist are off the wall.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|I have owned and listened to all of Mark Knopfler solo projects.  My opinion is, if you have one, you have them all.  This cd is ok, but too mellow for me again.  Too bad that his best music since the breakup of Dire Straits was on John Fogerty's \\"Deja Vu\\" cd.  I wish he would put more up tempo in his music, because he is now boring.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I'm a fan of Jane Austen, so I considered Emma a great comedy to be developed into a movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent is believable, as it was in her other British-based pieces. This DVD was a nice addition to my small collection.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|This CD is just like every other one that DKM has come out with... It is amazing. They change their sound around on various songs, which is refreshing, instead of all hard and loud all the time. They are one of the few bands that can consistently come out with a good record. Just like any other album they have come out with, this is worth the purchase.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Although the critics didn't rate this movie as highly as Bridget Jones's Diary, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable.  But then again, I'm a fan of both Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger.  I'm glad I bought it!!!
1426458975|4.0|A nice, quick read with convincing arguments about the inevitable dead end of the \\"progessive\\" nature of Evolution contrasted with the \\"conservative\\" values of Christianity. Plenty of wit on display and a barbed pen to take on GB Shaw, HG Wells, and Oscar Wilde among other notables. Here's to fairy tales.
B00005MP58|5.0|What a fantastic period mini-series!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed the development of the characters within this wonderful 18th century British romance.  It pays tribute to Jane Austen's wit and charm.  I think Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is as memorable as Olivier's original.  And the filming locations were beautiful.  This DVD will make a lovely gift for a special niece on my Christmas list!
0143038419|4.0|This book was so much fun to read! I love the way she writes. After reading this book, I tried my first yoga class. Now I am hooked! Might try the whole meditaion thing too!
0143036556|5.0|Another excellent book. I realized when I bought this book that I own and have enjoyed all of Jared Diamond's books. His topics and hypostheses are fascinating and compelling.
0393061310|5.0|This is an excellent book, the hypothesis is very compelling and interesting. I watched the DVD in addition to the book and I was not disappointed at all. Worth the read!
0553260111|4.0|I bought the book as a fan of the movie.  Totally  different plot, similar but different character.  In some ways the book is more \\"real\\", but the book  also strings together a series of near preposterous  events.  Makes it a real page turner though :)   Worth reading; if you liked the movie for its glimpse  into the \\"life of a spy\\", you'll like the book.
B000ROALCG|5.0|While no one can replace Hector Lavoe, Marc Anthony does an excellent job interpreting these songs.  Contemporary Salsa singers can learn a lot from Anthony.

0596101996|4.0|If you already program in C/C++, Java or Python, this is the right reference for making the transition to JavaScrript. It is thorough and is one of the few non-dreadful books on JS out there.  Beware of an abundance of crappy junk in this area.....
B000R7HY0K|2.0|First of all, I saw Grindhouse in the theaters.  It started out great with the fake trailer and then came Planter Terror.  What a great over the-top-action flick with tons of tongue in cheek laughs.  After it ends, you're treated to the real star of Grindhouse; the 3 fake trailers in the middle of the double feature.  We laughed so hard.  they were fantastic....and then comes DEATHPROOF.  I like Tarantino's stuff and think Pulp Fiction is one of the top 20 movies ever.   Deathproof halts the whole experience to a \\"grinding\\" pace.  Horribly boring, the theatrical version sets up the killings of chicks with unending talk about nothing.  Tarantino scripts that even took his own writing too serious as we have to sit through chicks talking about NOTHING for prolonged periods of time. All just to get to the cool chase at the end.  I told my brother to see Grindhouse and stay for the trailers after Planet Terror and then just get up and leave before Deathproof starts.  It was terrible.      This dvd is going to give you almost 30 minutes more of more talking about nothing.  They have hacked out the fake trailers, which were the best parts of Grindhouse to begin with and you know they're just going to milk you for the \\"total Grindhouse experience\\" dvd later next year.  Dvd's have become a dirty business.  I plan on RENTING Planet Terror when it comes out and I never want to see Death Proof agian....ever.    I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS, BTW.  I WILL NOT BUY THIS OR THE OTHER PLANET TERROR DISC AS THE TOTAL THING WILL COME EVENTUALLY.  STOP MILKING PEOPLE FOR MORE CASH.  THESE MOVIES ARE NOT THAT GREAT AS STAND ALONE FLICKS BUT GRINDHOUSE WAS AMAZING.  I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HOME MONTHS LATER AFTER SEEING IT IN THE THEATER ONLY TO SHOW \\"GRINDHOUSE\\" TO MY FRIENDS AT HOME BUT THESE SINGLE MOVIE DVD'S KILL THE ENTIRE POINT OF \\"GRINDHOUSE\\" AS A GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE.
0061015725|5.0|Prey is a great book. Especially, I am pretty knowledgeable in multi-robot systems and recent research, and although there's some exaggeration in the book, it's very well-written and interesting.
B000LC55F2|1.0|The Prestige is a slow, tepid, and completely annoying film thanks to all those tricks and twists. I can't believe how boring this film was, Christian Bale is a talented actor but his character makes you just want to punch him about 500 times, he is so unappealing in this role. To my surprise Hugh Jackman is the character you feel the most sympathy for, too bad he plays such a sucker in this one. And oh god that old-looking, shallow, and unattractive Scarlett Johanseen is enough to ruin anybody's day, ugh! The film has a good premise but all the \\"I got you\\" surprises becomes too much and I lost interest after 45 minutes, the ending was cruel and lacked spontaneity. Stay away from this stinker.
0380789035|2.0|Well, although I know this book has been very popular, it was not very interesting to me, and I stopped reading in the middle. The places, and the characters in the book are in my opnion not very Neil-geiman, and less creative compared to his other publications.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|Something's Gotta Give directed by Nancy Meyers isn't her best film but nonetheless, this romantic comedy is quite enjoyable. Starring Diane Keaton, Jack Nicolson, Amanda Peet, and Keanu Reeves Something's Gotta Give is a breezy romp about love at any age. The cast is full of enthusaism and Keaton was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for her performance as Erica, a successful playwright but lacking a healthy love life. Ultimately love blooms for Erica in the form of her attractive daughter's much older beau. This isn't a perfect film, but Something's Gotta Give will give you a few chuckles here in there.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Blue Ray version of this video is jaw dropping stunning.  Not only does the HD quality bringing out the life of this documentary, the camera angles and the music also draws you deep within the world of the wild animal kingdom.  Definitely a good choice.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Missundaztood from Pink is a raw and colorful array of pop and rock hits. Standout tracks include: Missundaztood, Don't Let Me Get Me, Just Like a Pill, Get the Party Started, Family Portrait, Dear Diary, and Lonely Girl. Pink's first album, Can't Take Me Home didn't show Pink's range as a singer and songwriter, but with this album Pink was finally given freedom to express what she wanted and needed to say thanks in part to friend and mentor Linda Perry. Some of the rest of the tracks are ok, nothing spectacular but it's an album you can relate to and have fun with as well, very tongue-in-cheek.
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is debonair, rich, handsome and the author of the perfect bank robbery until he meets Vicky Anderson (Faye Dunaway), who is debonair, beautiful and determined that her insurance company will not lose the two million plus dollars that Crowne has stolen. \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" then comes down to a battle of wits between these two as Anderson attempts to solve what in the beginning appears to be a perfect crime and eventually winds up in bed with her chief suspect.<br /><br />The film is smart, slick and in the end great entertainment. There are nice touches here and there: for example, the closeup shot of the tombstone with the inscription \\"Blessed Are The Pure In Heart\\" when Crown visits the cemetery to pick up the stolen money. Both Dunaway and McQueen are dressed in high fashion-- but oh, so sixties-- and get into their roles. The chemistry is good between them. And surely we are not to take this film too seriously when the chief investigator Eddie Malone (Paul Burke) is reminiscent of older comedic fumbling law enforcement types who just shout a lot.<br /><br />The beginning scenes as well as many others are made up of divided screens and multiple frames of the same image. A little of this technique goes a long way. The cinematographer should have stopped while he was ahead. But that's a minor quibble. This movie is great escapist entertainment.
075640407X|5.0|I thought The first book of this three part story to be very well written, the characters vivid and \\"alive\\" and most of all left me wanting more now.  I hope part two \\"Day Two\\" will be forthcoming soon.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|At first, it seems a strange fit, mostly because of the fact that Eddie Vedder's lyrics are more eloquent than Alexander Supertramp's own musings, the man at the center of Penn's film.  But the job of a soundtrack isn't just to supplement the visuals.  In this case, Vedder is almost picking up on the book and riffing on the main's character's philosophy.  As far as the actual songs, I really don't see how it's going to disappoint PJ fans.  It's raw, honest work, but sadly the best of the songs here seem to be the shortest such as 'No Ceiling'. The greatest compliment you can give is that the soundtrack fits the film and vice-versa.  Like one and it's hard to see you disliking the other.

B00006CXGH|4.0|Sure I am a big fan of Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix, but this movie is an excellent spy thriller. When a long time sleeper cell wakes up they the cold war is pretty much over and they don't want to activate to spy or carry out covert operations against the U.S. any longer. The wife and husband have a teenage son who has only known the ways of being an American. The problem is they are being hunted by their own and only with the help of the FBI, and an agent played by Poitier, are they likely to have any chance at survival. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|Tarantino is by far one of the best directors of our lifetime. I won't ruin it for you by giving away any of the plot. I appreciate that the DVD version of this film is extended & it is well worth the money. Forget those boo-hoo romantic comedies--this is my kind of chick flick. I recommend this film to every woman looking for something fun & original to watch.  I really loved every single minute of this film!!!

B0000AI45P|5.0|In the main, it is fair to say that I have no respect whatsoever for the thuggish attitude of much of the late 1970s \\"punk revolution\\" and the basic idea of trying to make noise rather than actual music.<br /><br />However, though Television played throughout their career along this scene they were in most respects a very different band from the repetitive thuggishness of the Ramones. The tone here is soft if lively, and the songs intensely melodic throughout from the first verse of the opener \\"See No Evil\\", a dramatic rocker notable for its vocal harmonies, which were to predate a lot of what was heard on the radio in the 1980s.<br /><br />\\"Venus\\", the second track, is even better: it is refreshing to hear the way in which Verlaine is so successful and truly pondering on what life should be about, and \\"Friction\\", if the soloing here is somewhat excessive, continues in that vein. \\"Marquee Moon\\", for all the clear recognition the song receives from Fred Smith's first notes and the lengthy, stark intro of each verse, takes a lot of time to get used to. Appreciating the point behind the length of Verlaine's last solo being the difficulty, but one eventually sees that he possesses great talent on guitar, if not necessarily the equal of Lloyd.<br /><br />\\"Marquee Moon\\" illustrates clearly how Richard Lloyd's fiery, yet musicianly guitar work held Verlaine's virtuosity in check to produce something much greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />\\"Elevation\\" was the rawest track on the record, but the real centrepieces of the album were the beautiful piano-led ballads \\"Guiding Light\\" and \\"Torn Curtain\\". Here, the band's intense softness is seen at its clearest, aided by Andy Johns' uncluttered production, and the beauty both of Verlaine's voice and Lloyd's guitar work comes right to the fore. \\"Torn Curtain\\" (unfortunately edited on this CD reissue) was particularly wonderful, at times feeling like a nightmarish dream. \\"Prove It\\" was a slow groove rocker that showed Verlaine's unusual lyrical talents in full bloom.<br /><br />The remastered version, besides a much better sund, features a brilliant alternative version of \\"See No Evil\\" that is undoubtedly worth the extra money even if you had the earler CD.<br /><br />On the whole, if occasionally rather self-indulgent, \\"Marquee Moon\\"'s delicate softness and lyrical themes were unique for their day, and \\"Torn Curtain\\" in particular sounds like a precursor of 1990s psychedelia and sadcore. \\"Marquee Moon\\" is one of the most acclaimed recordings in history, and there really are enough reasons why to justify buying it.n full bloom.

B000M5B6Q0|4.0|If you like the movie, you'll enjoy the songs.  You'd end up playing it over and over again, and singing along.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|Well I was looking for something spectacular like Late Registration and you know what? This cd was so far from it. I think I must have skipped the first three cuts and then a couple more until I got to a song that was even decent. Mind you there's only 13 tracks so not much of a cd. I don't see how anyone can hype this up. Fifty's cd is a lot better. And to think that I bought this cd. Fifty's cd isn't like the first one he dropped no or the Massacre but it still tops this cd hands down.   No doubt the guy has talent improving beats, but only with samples of other peoples stuff. Anyone that is over 30 would know this. I thought I was a kid again in the 80's because of all the samples he had on here. And as far as his lyrics!! Well I have heard better on the street corner. Much better. In my opinion this cd should be called, freshman because he should have made this cd before the others. Maybe it would appear like he progressed.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|I am so glad I found this movie.  After renting it, I enjoyed it so much I wanted to have my own copy.  It's just a honest plain good fun type of movie.  It's a feel good movie!
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell is such a talented song writer and musical arranger.  This disc is proof of that. \\"One Night Last Summer\\" is a goregous instrumental track.  I love the saxophone playing by Bob Sheppard on this track and throughout this disc.  The piano playing is beautiful on this track too.  Joni includes a new version of her classic tune \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\".  I also liked the track \\"This Place\\".  These are two songs about protecting the enviroment.  \\"Hana\\" is another highlight on this disc.  This groovy song is a tribute to hard working people.  This song is also a reminder not to give up when times are tough.  \\"If\\" is a song that reminds us to be patient with ourselves and other people.  Joni expresses her anti war feelings on the tracks \\"If I Had A Heart\\" and \\"Strong And Wrong\\"  These songs are very touching and thought provoking.  I really enjoyed listening to this album.

B000BNX4MC|4.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a feel-good movie brought to us by the King of the '80s Comedies, John Hughes (he gave us Home Alone, The Great Outdoors, Vacation, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Planes Trains and Automobiles, and many more). His delicious sense of humor is felt deeply in his legacy of comedy.<br /><br />I enjoy this film for its fun, its comedy, its music, its sense of grabbing life and living it. This is a fantasy, a perfect day in the life of a teenager in America. That's why we love it so. We want a day like this, we want to know wacky people like this.<br /><br />I love this film mostly for the hilarious performances of Jeffrey Jones and Edie McClurg: the pompous principal and his totally incapable, ditzy secretary. These two characters could have their own television sitcom. They steal the show here. But the credit must also go to John Hughes for writing these wonderful characters and directing this film so cleverly. He knows what's funny, and what's touching. He has created a charming movie, maybe his best. But there are too many of his comedies to choose a favorite.
B00001QEE5|4.0|I rented this to see if I wanted to buy it for my 2 year old and I've decided not to. It was actually pretty good, the animation is magical and the story is of course delightful. But for a 2 year old, I didn't like how Captain Hook shoots and kills one of the pirates, (it happens off-screen, but there are a lot of guns in general). And I was unhappy with how the indians are depicted, (this being 1953) especially in the song \\"What made the red man red?\\" Lots of \\"How\\" and \\"Ugh\\". That's one song I don't want him to learn.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|This is an album that is difficult for me to categorize.  In my opinion The Mars Volta are a progressive rock band.  Many will disagree with this assessment, but to my ears these guys are producing music that is truly unique and unlike anything else out there.  They combine elements of older bands like King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, Amon Duul with more modern progish bands like Tool and Coheed And Cambria.  The music on Francis really covers a lot of ground.  Some of it is very accessible while other parts of the disc are very experimental.  The album is a concept piece of sorts following the entries in a diary that one of the band members supposedly found.  The musicians are all top notch and there are plenty of incendiary instrumental workouts to go along with the vocal sections.  The vocals are going to be an acquired taste.  Personally I like them, but I am sure they are not everyone's cup of tea.  The Mars Volta provide challenging music for people who are looking for something with a bit more substance than today's mainstream rock.  The music should also appeal to older progressive rock fans, although this definitely ain't your grand pappy's brand of prog.

0385659806|3.0|As I mentioned in my review of [[ASIN:1594481938 A Long Way Down]], I had not read any fiction in years. But, once you read one they sort of get addicting.     [[ASIN:1400032717 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]] had been sitting on my shelf for at least two years. Not that all this detail matters but, it was squeezed in between [[ASIN:0156027321 Life of Pi]] and [[ASIN:0375725601 The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America]]. Let me tell you about the book.    This, a mystery story involving an autistic 15-year-old named Christopher as a junior Sherlock Holmes in search of a killer, is about as non-linear as a book can get. The first book this brings to mind is Laurence Sterne's [[ASIN:0141439777 The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman: The Florida Edition (Penguin Classics)]]. Through the course of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, we are treated to math problems, jokes, makes, signage and all manner of side musings. The best of which will send you to Google searching The Monty Hall Problem.    This is exactly the type of book I have both always wanted to write and like to read. It mirrors life in that there are digressions from the narrative and things do not move directly from beginning to end. (Unlike the movies.)     Mark Haddon is obviously very smart (or a really good researcher). His characters all came to life - whether they were teenagers or octogenarians - and seemed like real people. His use of and explanation of various aspects of the mystery genre were also expertly interwoven into the text.    One overplayed note here, and in literature from the UK is characters that hate France. For reasons obvious to those who know me, I don't share this view. Much like characters that hate blacks (thinking of The Things They Carried) or Jews or others, it strikes me that the author is using their characters to say things they can't or won't say themselves. Nick Hornby alsohas a couple of digs on France in A Long Way Down. In the case of Christopher, I do not think the book is bettered by his hate of France. I wonder if there would be as many positive reviews if he hated America because all of the people talked poor English, were fat and drove lots of really big yellow cars. I guess I'll have to just say no to English authors. Or maybe books should carry ratings like movies. (Rated R for Racist...)    That issue aside, I can highly recommend this to mystery readers, lovers of novels that extend beyond conventional generic boundaries. And, if you are not careful, you just might learn something.
0374105235|5.0|\\"Brutal honesty, heart-wrenching\\" is the consistent commentary on this book. I was only beginning Chapter 4 when I had tears welling up in my eyes. I've seen Ishmael Beah several times on CSPAN on his book tour, and I've read a lot about him and his \\"new Mom\\" Laura Simms on the internet. I have no doubt in my mind that these two were destined to cross paths in order to help each other in the greater cause that they have chosen.    Just imagine that this is the story of just one victim out of millions.    My heart goes out to Ishmael Beah, and my utmost respect and admiration goes out to Laura Simms, the New York woman who had no reason whatsover to take on what most of us would have considered very high risk and dangerous. She had no reason to bring a former war killer and stranger out of some foreign land to come live with her.     On repatriating Beah to America, Simms could have put him in a home or refugee camp somewhere and get on with her life, and that would still be very commendable on her part. But she chosed to be an active part of his life. Her faith demonstrates the very best of humanity and for Ishmael, a great capacity for human redemption. The end result is the rehabilitation of an innocent boy who is now helping to prevent the brutalizing of children worldwide.

B0000C0FJB|3.0|Even after reading all of the reviews talking about how so-so the sound was I decided to buy the cd anyway.  It took me a while to decide how to really describe the quality of the album, so here goes.  It sounds like your friend went to a Rush concert and had pretty good seats close to the stage.  During the concert he calls you on a cell phone to let you hear what it sounds like to be there.  Put that on a cd and you have it.  You can kind of understand the lyrics on some of the tracks when the crowd is singing along.  Otherwise, it is a lot drums, guitars, crowd cheering, and an occasionally audible singer.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I recently saw \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" and became enamored with Farrell's acting. As someone who never watched \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" I was not entirely certain what to expect. So, I began trudging backwards. I watched \\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\\" and was struck by its light-hearted silliness. It has a sort of playful charm that most people can easily appreciate. But then I bought \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" and was shocked by the clumsy writing, delivery, and structure.       The writing and delivery is excruciatingly awkward (and not in an \\"ironic\\" way). It is every \\"bad\\" joke you have ever heard ... and that would have been fine, if only the writers/director gave them a fresh spin. Unfortunately, that did not happen. And while there are some \\"bad\\" films which have tremendous moments of greatness ... this is not one of those. The \\"jazz flute\\" bit is amusing, but not enough negate the film's very deep flaws. While I expected a \\"surface\\" film (one devoid of meaning but rich in fun), I did not expect this lack of technical sophistication. One such issue resides with the multiple narrators. While a third-person narrator initially lends the work a \\"mockumentary\\" feel, the audience then receives a series of first-person narrations ... how exactly does that work? (And, no \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is not the problem here ... it is a serious logical error).     I maintain that this work is representative of Farrell's unpolished side (perhaps his \\"Saturday Night Live\\" side). Still, this provides a basis for examining Farrell's newer works. It is amazing to see the progress this actor has made stylistically and technically over the past four years. It is wonderful to note Farrell can now create both mature art (like \\"Stranger than Fiction\\") AND spirited comedies that reach a wide audience (like \\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\\"). I look forward to Farrell's future films and hope that he continues to demand excellence from both him and his creative team.
1401300529|5.0|\\"The Coldest Winter,\\" David Halberstam's final journalistic tribute to heroes, is a fitting tribute to the men of the oft forgotten war.   Halberstam's lengthy career in journalism and as an author shows in his brilliant writing style that keeps you engrossed in every word. It is not surprising that someone who has written so much about Vietnam, would have a huge resource to draw upon in a work about the Korean War.   The Coldest Winter is a story that needed telling, much the way Herodotus told of the men of Thermopylae or, more recently how Stephen Ambrose told of the men of Easy Company in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"     Halberstam understood well how most Americans ignore the events and outcome of the Korean Conflict; often, that part of history seems better left untold. The Coldest Winter tells this story and it's back stories and even it's substantial post-script. We mustn't forget that South Korea's success today owes a debt to the American and U.N. forces who fought there over half a century ago.   What Halberstam also does in this book is point out the miserable failings of Generals like MacArthur, long-time sacred cows of the World Wars, whose hubris in later life jeopardized the legacy of any truly heroic deeds of their early careers. General Ned Almond is also lambasted for his stubbornness and poor leadership style, which Halberstam shows led to unnecessary losses of American and U.N. forces.   While \\"Coldest Winter\\" is by no means concise as far as a historiography goes, Halberstam has revealed the machinations that led to the war and the egos that sustained it.  This is not a blow-by-blow, battlefield-to-battlefield account of the Korean War, much of the latter part of the war is overlooked.  But, it covers the broader picture and the political implications and ramifications of American civilian policy versus military instinct in the early 1950s, however poor it may have served us.    The Coldest Winter is a hefty book, at over 650 pages, broken into eleven sections with over 50 chapters, but it reads as fast as it reads brilliant.   This is the first Halberstam book I have read, I regret that it comes only after his passing. There were certainly more great works to come had he not met his untimely death.   REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, OTHER READERS, PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS TOO.
1564148793|5.0|Protection and Reversal Magick is a well done book, for both the novice or the experienced. The author's conversational tone (and occasional humor) is much appreciated. I found that even in just the reading of the book, the principles and ideas seemed to help and I like that the meditations or spells, if you prefer, can be done virtually anywhere at any time. Preferably, of course, you would prefer to be alone to concentrate, but in an emergency you gotta do what you gotta do...The information on how to tell whether you are the recipient of a psychic attack is invaluable.<br /><br />I am looking forward to future books by Jason. He is obviously quite accomplished, an excellent teacher, and well-grounded in the craft.
B00002E23E|2.0|#1 I'm a fairly big zeppelin fan.<br />#2 Zeppelin wasn't always great.<br /><br />They had their \\"good times bad times\\"  haha couldn't resist.  When THIS DVD came out I bought it having never seen the movie or zeppelin live.  I WAS 6 when this movie was made.  The picture quality of this release was OK, THE SOUND WAS POOR.<br /><br />Did I point out I'm a Hi-Fi buff?  not surround sound, but 2-channel.<br /><br />When the 2 disc Led Zeppelin came out in 2003 I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  sound and picture.  I thought \\"I hope they remaster TSRTS THIS way!!\\"  AND NOW THEY HAVE!!!  actually several performances from TSRTS were included on the double DVD and they sounded great!<br /><br />So, if you can afford to wait until November 2007 and have $35 to spend GET THAT RELEASE.<br /><br />Sadly, all the hoakey short films and sloppy guitar riffs will probably be intact, but also the moments of brilliance and magic.<br /><br />EDIT (12/17/2007)  THE 2 disc REMASTERED The Song Remains The Same looks great and sounds great minus some of the sloppy playing by jimmy, but its worth owning NOW with improved picture, sound and extras like extra songs and interviews... m.
0800141660|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for years and I doubt it will be replaced any time soon.  It is wonderful.  It is cast brilliantly and is well written.  If you haven't read the book, they cut out several characters for the movie.  It seems like that would have done serious damage to the plot and yet, nothing is missing.  It still works really well.  The characters are so entertaining, without becoming over-the-top.  My only complaint is that Lucy Steele was played a little too sweetly.  The Lucy in the book was a little crude and more obviously malicious.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this movie by now, hurry up and buy it.  You'll want to see it over and over.  Or your wife will anyway.
B000V63BN6|4.0|When it comes to great albums, Stevie Wonder has really delivered as one of the most definitive artists in Motown history. His reflections are shown respectfully with his 2002, The Definitive Collection handles as a delightful re-introduction and a well-detailed retrospective of one of the most innovative artists of all time. The songs here are all remastered well, and shows as a fantastic single disc record. There are a lot of great tracks that are just upbeat and make you want to get up and dance from Uptight, and Sir Duke, to elegant and beautiful ballads like You Are The Sunshine Of My Life, and the elegantly crafted Overjoyed, and the Oscar-winning I Just Called To Say I Love You. This is a great album for you to download to your MP3 player. I absolutely recommend this if you haven't yet bought your first Stevie Wonder album, or if you're a true die hard fan.<br /><br />Songs: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B+
B000J10EQU|3.0|This movie had some good points and some bad.  For the most part, the casting was fabulous, particularly Parker Posey.  Kate Bosworth was a good Lois, but they should have hired someone older.  Lois is supposed to have been a hot shot reporter even before having a son who is now five.  No way she's less than 30 and Bosworth looks like a college student.  Spacey was a good Lex for what he had to work with.  Did they ever explain why a criminal mastermind with all the knowledge in the universe couldn't come up with a better plan than to create a giant rock in the ocean?  He just wants to be a slumlord?  I don't get it.<br /><br />Some of the flying around and action was pretty good.  And then it all ended rather abruptly.  It seemed like they were more concerned with leaving everything open for a sequel than in providing any kind of satisfying conclusion this time.

0446693804|4.0|Although I usually tend to go for the romance novels, this one had so much more packed in the pages. Nicolas Sparks tells a story that many high schoolers can relate to. I remember reading this as a young freshman and thinking about how he seemed to know exactly what a kid my age would be going through.     The story centers on a troubled teen named Landon Carter who is having difficulties with the fact that his dad walked out on his mom and him and figuring out which group he \\"belonged\\" to at his high school. He thought he had everything figured out until he was forced to join the drama club after an unfortunate turn of events.    That's where his world began unraveling. Having difficulties memorizing his lines, he has to turn to the one person he and his friends teased the most, Jamie Sullivan. Though he didn't find out for a while, her life was not all roses like the front she put on.     This book is a good read for all, but I think that middle and high school aged students can get a lot out of it. It deals with the issues that most students struggle with: friends, relationships, family, and essentially who they are and what their purpose in life is.

1401300529|5.0|The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War by David Halberstam will stand the test to time just as all of his other works have.  It is sad that Mr. Halberstam died last April in an automobile accident while working on his next book.  This fact makes reading his last book doubly important, and a little difficult.  This is the last trip to the water fountain.<br /><br />The Coldest Winter is well written.  While lengthy, there is no fat.  Cut a few facts here or there and you've changed the value of the work and not for the better.  With books like this I sometimes jump around from chapter to chapter taking the topics in an order that is important to me.  I wasn't able to do that with the Coldest Winter.<br /><br />There are a few surprises in the book.  I thought that MacArthur was treated pretty fairly by Halberstam.  MacArthur is not the perfect leader that he has been portrayed as in much of the media.  In fact, at this stage of his career he is beginning to exhibit signs of feebleness brought on by the shaking hands and loss of hearing.  That MacArthur underestimated the Communist Koreans is a fact of history but not often discussed.<br /><br />I was also taken by the amount of confusion in the Truman administration during the first few days after the North crossed the border.  Very eye opening.<br /><br />I also highly valued the discussions of both Korean leaders, Syngman Rhee in the south and Kim Il Sung in the north.  Halberstams treatment of these two leaders along with his wonderfully concise but accurate history of both the Koreas not only adds to the value of this book, but puts into perspective much of the recent difficulty with North Korea and their obsession with nuclear weapons.<br /><br />Halberstam has always written masterfully constructed books.  The reader can tell that Halberstam loved research because he did it so well and it shows in his books.<br /><br />The Coldest Winter, in my opinion, is a must read for those that love current events but love history as well.<br /><br />The Coldest Winter will be a terrific addition to your personal library.will be a terrific addition to your personal library.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|This DVD rocks!<br />Granted, a film like this won't be to everyone's taste (nor should it be). \\"Death Proof - Extended and Unrated\\" is long and talky, but if you're game enough to stick with it you'll be rewarded with some witty banter, some steamy scenes, and some of the best smash-up car chases in years. All this and a groovy soundtrack, too.<br />The extras -- mainly concerning the background, editing and casting of the film -- are not wildly extensive. However, they more than adequately convey the filmmakers' excitement and enthusiasm for what they felt would be a return to the freewheeling days of exploitation cinema: when small time studios tossed aside mainstream cinematic conventions and threw in everything but the kitchen sink to deliver some cheap thrills and make a fast buck.<br />That the theatrical double-feature bombed at the box office is both a crime and a shame. While it would be nice to have the whole enchilada in one convenient package, at least this project saw the light of day which is a far better fate than most such endeavours would likely receive in this age of empty-headed, watered-down, inspirationless CGI-fests. Whatever has been taken out or added to this release since then (and whatever double-dips may lie on the horizon), I'd rather have it piecemeal than not at all.<br />Don't deny yourselves, folks; buy this DVD. Bundle it up in a homemade double feature with \\"Planet Terror\\" (or any exploitation flick of your choice), invite a few friends over and have a rollicking good time.
0143038419|5.0|I remember reading briefly about this book, and I assumed this is another book about a mother who loved cooking and shared her eating out experience in Italy. However, when I started reading this book it far exceeded my expectation to the degree that I could not put the book down .     What a great writing, and Elizabeth Gilbert's style of writing reminds me of  Carrie's writing in Sex and City, but of course the topic is not about sex and much more profound.     When you read the book you feel so connected to the writer. You will be amazed by her friendly spirit, and her sincerity. You will travel the world with her, and will be awed by her experiences. From having pleasure  eating in Italy to meditating in an Indian Ashram. You will see her transcend over her grief little by little as she travels to Italy, India and Indonesia.     The novelty of the experiences she presented in this book was so refreshing, and she attracted many wonderful people around her throughout her travel to the degree that I thought : I want to know these people.      I haven't read anything this good for quiet sometime and highly recommend this book especially to people who have some spiritual pulls inside them.
0743486285|5.0|When I ordered this book I expected a narrative story about a drugged up rock star...but I found a collection of very real and gruesome diary entries that blew my mind. Nikki Sixx has lived a life that most of us can't even imagine exists...it's almost unreal and at the same time too real and scary. I LOVED IT.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I admit I hadn't even heard of the book, movie, or CD until Amazon e-mailed me to inform me of the upcoming CD release (thanks Amazon!!!).  Being a huge PJ fan, I was ecstatic to say the least.  Once I heard the premise of the movie, I was very much intrigued.  The CD tells the story beautifully.  Some songs are uplifting while others are dark and somber.  It truly is captivating and displays not only Eddie's incredible voice but his immense songwriting abilities.  If you appreciate PJ's softer side, you will very much enjoy this CD.  Yes the album is short, but you can fix that by pushing play again.
159102594X|4.0|Long on intrigue, stark and direct, from a quality standpoint Abercrombie's debut fits well within the upper reaches of the fantasy genre and produces a number of decent mysteries for books two and three of the trilogy.  Abercrombie has put a new spin on the typical medieval fantasy fare.    First, his main characters are both archetypal, and not.  There are six primary ones: Collem West, the low-born, capable, hardworking warrior who has accomplished a great deal in the caste-bound military system of the main setting for the novel, the empire known as the Union; Ferro Maljinn, a warrior woman from the south who has seen war, death, and an existential threat to all mankind but knows only hate; Jezal Luthar the gifted swordsman who typifies the courtier-set until his mindset is changed by a no-nonsense love interest; the Dogman, a Norse-type warrior from the North who fights with a perpetually feuding band of brothers that wishes to save the world from two horrible dangers; Logen Ninefingers, a barbarian warrior who has far more human frailties than Conan; and Sand dan Glokta, the Inquisitor.    Glokta is Abercrombie's best character -- a hero of the Union, champion swordsman, he was captured during a previous war and physically shattered such that as a 35-year old man, his appearance and motor skills are closer to someone three times his age.  But his mind works well -- he is sharp, biting, cruel, courteous, and bitter by turns.       This volume has some action (fights, duels, small battles, some magic), and hints at the overall plot (the plot points are really a bunch of dots on paper, without a lot of connecting lines yes), but primarily sustains its momentum with intrigue and detail to set up the remaining books.  Abercrombie's writing is direct, coarse (lots of epithets), frequently funny, and often dark.      All told, a fine beginning.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|What does it sound like? It sounds like a live fresh concert does when you go to one and hear it for yourself. It doesn't sound like weld. But I still would give it a 4 star rating and would tell you to buy it if you already own weld.    What is the DVD about? First the DVD is about sound quaity. When you play it on your TV, up comes a screen not unlike the album cover where you can select set up. And set up your player for 24 bit 96 khz stereo. So let me say here that Neil Young is ahead of his time Putting in a DVD for the sound all the time. What's wrong don't they have DVD players? So if your DVD player works buy this copy. Also you get images of backstage biography with more photos of the Filmore east concert and a picture of a $5.50 pass. Now at this writing that would be $200 for a ticket to NY chrome dreams tour. It also seems to be priced right from the 3 party vendors, worth taking a look at to see if you like it. When I sat down to watch it I realize all my 35mm film was so brittle it jammed the machine at the photomart the other day they had to send the machine back to get it unjammed so maybe this is all I'm going to get here is some clipping they salvaged. So I found it cool to watch. I really got into the clips by the time \\"come on baby lets go downtown\\" played. The clips are synced to the songs played. So what I'm going to to is I play everything on my DVD player around the house anyway so I'll just play only the DVD. But the CD is for ripping on my computer and putting on a Mp3 player or making  copies for my cars. Can't rip a DVD for the car yet.
B000UR366S|5.0|After nearly a decade of re-mixes and re-hashes Joni is back with an album of all new material. This album picks up where \\"Turbulent Indigo\\" left off. She has returned to darker lyrics and natural instrumentation; both missing on \\"Taming the Tiger,\\" the chronological follow up to the Grammy winning \\"Turbulent Indigo.\\"    I am just grateful to hear Joni again. That alone was worth the price of the C.D. I am happy to say this material, as well as Joni's voice, are still magical. Artists half her age rarely shine this bright.  Beyond that, I will not judge perfection.     My only concern? Will we have to wait another ten years to hear from her again?
B00066FBQG|3.0|It seems to me that this film wants to please all ways it can use. Is it a comedy or is it not? There is no feeling of old west, because the main persons are very modern. I don't understand the meaning of \\"Raindrops\\" -ballad in between. It makes everything even more unreal. Actors are good and it is very well done, but I have no feelings for it. I do not care criminals as heroes which makes it impossible to identify. Randoph Scott westerns beat this any day!
1400097029|4.0|A young boy full of turbid imaginings ages into a frustrated, self-destructive widower. He's a skillful creation, even if his take on life leaves the reader feeling a little queasy.<br /><br />An art historian, he takes a grim view of human bodies. Even the objects of his youthful desire are described in terms of thickened and bulging flesh, veins, sweaty skin, greasy hair, chilly lavender lips. Bodies are instruments of lust and illness, and to this narrator, the two seem wedded by events in his past and his present.<br /><br />The plot is simple. Reeling from one tragedy, he returns to the site of another, hoping to drink his way into an understanding of both. As a story, it's given a surpisingly hopeful ending. It is not so much the story, though, it is of course the way it is told. The prose here is stunning, a catalog of unusual words and poetic imagery.<br /><br />Ah, but this character. He bugged me.<br /><br />He is painfully aware of the flaws of the bodies around him, including his own. He holds his daughter's lack of artful proportions against her, remarking on her long neck and melony bottom, though the sight of her small hands folded can bring him to tears. He rages at his own aging. The body that betrays him most is that of his late wife, who succumbs to cancer. Her death is not noble, not beautiful, and neither is he, though the language of the book certainly is.<br /><br />His late wife takes a series of photos of patients at the hospital, focusing in color on their scars, deformities, ruptures and stumps. \\"It's my indictment,\\" she says. This book functions in much the same way, as a written indictment of the body and all its betrayals.<br /><br />Thank god for the ending.
0340839937|2.0|I've listened to this book (from audible.com) for the last 10 days or so.  I selected it because it is supposed to be one of the best sci-fi novels and had great reviews.  I have been disappointed.    I kept expecting it to get more exciting, more poignant or more enthralling but it never did.  Frankly, it was boring.    Some of my criticisms:  The author did not set up the Paul's secondary characters very well. I felt that I barely knew them and did not feel the supposedly \\"closeness\\" that Paul felt with them.  Also,  the author does not know how to write action.  He would create conflict but never created a satisfactorily climax.  After the extraordinary buildup, the end kind of puttered out like a damp roman candle.  Poof! a few words and it was all over.     I think that the author specializes in espionage and politics, not action.  There is a buildup, and a buildup to the climax (which is supposed to be huge) then. . . a couple of sentences and the conflict is over.  Just like that - very little payoff.    This happened several times in book and I finally realized that this is not an adventure novel but a political novel.  The lack of action after such buildup and conflict is very disappointing.
1401300529|3.0|This book is supposed to be a complete history of the Korean War but it falls far short of that goal. Having fought in Korea at the beginning and the end of the war, I was disappointed that the book devotes very little to what happened after MacArthur is fired in early 1951. The title \\" The Coldest Winter\\" fairly sums up the book because it is mainly devoted to explaining what occurred up to and through the route of the UN Forces during the winter of 1950. To that point, the book is fairly thorough and accurate but it only repeats what many other authors have already written. There are some inaccuracies though, such as the lament that while there are movies about the WWII,  Vietnam, etc., there are no movies about the Korean War. In fact there are over a dozen movies such as The Bridge at Toko-Ri\\", \\"Pork Chop Hill\\", \\"Retreat Hell\\", \\"Steel Helmet\\", to name a few.      After the UN forces were driven back by the Chinese deep into South Korea, the UN forces were able to reorganize and launched a major counterattack in early 1951 which Halberstam writes about. But what the book fails to bring out is that in routing the UN forces, the Chinese had suffered heavy losses and did not have the reserves to replace those losses. The UN counter offensive resulted in more heavy losses to the Chinese as they were pushed back into North Korea, particularly on the eastern flank. The entire Chinese front was in such danger or collapsing that the Chinese sought a truce and Pres. Truman's biggest mistake was to agree to the truce. Had the UN rejected the truce offer, the Chinese would have been forced to retreat deep into N. Korea and that would have been a propitious time for the UN to agree to an armistice. Instead, the Chinese were able to get their second wind and the war went on for over two more years ending on July 28, 1953. It ended then only because a major Chinese offensive designed to push the Marines back across the Imjin River failed and the Chinese again had run out of steam.    Many important battles were fought up until the end which Halberstam fails to even acknowledge, particularly the last battle of Boulder City. But where he really falls short is that he misses all the maneuvering of Pres. Eisenhower to bring the war to an end, how the 25th Division was ordered not to counterattack and retake key outposts in May 1953, and later the First Marine Division was also barred from retaking other key outposts lost to the Chinese in July 1953. The loss of those outposts left the Marines naked on Boulder City and meant that the battle was fought in their front lines instead of 2,000 yards in front of them, and the result was very heavy casualties for the Marines. Except for some blunders by the Chinese, they could have penetrated the lines and driven the UN back across the Imjim River which would have left the Chinese a clear route right into the Korean capital at Seoul. Halberstam apparently was unaware of how significant the last battle was in War.   I don't agree with some of the review of this book by the  Associated Press Reviewer. He laments that the book fails to cover the deaths of many Korean civilians. It is true that many Koreans died but he exaggerates the number of Koreans who died at the hands of Americans. The few that were killed  by Americans were killed in the first days of the war mainly because North Korean soldiers intermingled with civilians. Some were killed as the result of bombing and shelling of enemy positions. In my own experience three civilians were killed in a house in North Korea in which the North Koreans were using as a machine gun nest. But the civilian deaths were irrelevant as far as history goes because those deaths did not influence the outcome of the war or any battles. Halberstam rightfully excluded mention of them.

B000W4KT6E|4.0|Any film that features a touching love scene shot in a Baltimore backyard with laundry hanging on the line (as Moms used to say) between Christopher Walken ( Wilbur Turnblad) and John Travolta (as an almost scary Edna Turnblad) is OK with me. That that scene may also be one of the most romantic scenes of this or any year is crazy on the one hand and perplexing on the other. With that being said, director Adam Shankman has magically turned the stage musical into something that is more full of life, more effervescent than either the play or the John Waters slight, though terrific film of 1988.<br />Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky who almost makes us forget Rikki Lake from the film) is a Baltimore teenager: chubby of body, colossal of hair and bubbling over with good cheer and ironclad self esteem. The year is 1962 and the signs of change are everywhere Tracy goes foremost of which is the \\"Corny Collins Show,\\" an American Bandstand-type show which features a \\"Negro Day\\" once a month: a situation that Tracy and her friends Penny (Amanda Bynes) and Link (Zac Efron) are desperate to change into an everyday occurrence. Edna, who hasn't left the house since 1951 and therefore very much aware and embarrassed of her size discourages Tracy from auditioning as a dancer for the show but Tracy, to her credit, feels confident enough about her dancing does so anyway and is finally accepted into the Corny Collins fold much to the chagrin of both Velma Von Tussle ( a gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow).<br />\\"Hairspray is also very much a capsule of its time and place: pregnant women smoking and drinking martinis, children in cars without seat belts buckled, boys and girls hair greased and sprayed to within an inch of its life (Tracy is accused of having a \\"hair-don't\\" at one point) and bigots spouting the kind of gunk that bigots do.<br />\\"Hairspray\\" is ultimately a big, calorie laden birthday cake of a film: you know you shouldn't imbibe but you can't help yourself. But along with the sugar rush of this spectacle there lays some lumps based on reality which point out, not only how much has changed since 1962 but more importantly how much has stayed the same.elf.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Next, a movie based on the Philip K. Dick short story,  is very clever in spots. Nicholas Cage plays a precognative gmbler/magician who can see two minutes into the future. The interesting thing in this movie is that he can see all possible futures; this led to some interesting scenes in the movie. The plot revolves around terrorists planning to blow up LA who finad out that this guy could upset their master plan. Government agents are looking for this guy too for the same reason. Ahh, terrorism, the all purpose plot device - why blow up LA? Just because I guess - whatever..      Anyway, the special effects are cool, there are some good action sequences and Cage is a good choice to play the main character in the movie. Its not worth the 9-10 bucks it would have taken to see this in the theatres but it is worth renting/buying on sale.

0316018953|4.0|I enjoyed this novel. Michael Connelly has a unique writing style that is both interesting and satisfying. I thought the number of pages (225) was about 90 pages short which would have improved the development of the characters and plot. The plot is fairly simple and I didn't have a hard time following the clues in each chapter. With more pages the story and the characters would have been flushed out more. Still Mr. Connelly was able to pack everything into this mini novel and it kept me reading page after page.

B000UFAURI|5.0|\\"In Your Honor\\", the album released in 2005, was a two-disc, 20-track, landmark for the Foo Fighters.  The album featured 10 \\"loud\\" tracks and 10 \\"not-so-loud\\" tracks.  And together, all 20 tracks showcased the Foo Fighters' talent (with a little help from a few others).<br /><br />Now, two years later, \\"Echos, Silence, Patience, and Grace\\" hits the streets and prooves that Dave and company are still on top of the game.  These boys have talent.  This album is both \\"loud\\" and \\"not-so-loud\\" and all 12 tracks flow nicely.  Nothing is out of place.  \\"The Pretender\\" is a breath-taking beginning and \\"Home\\" is an astonishing conclusion.<br /><br />If you love the Foo Fighters, you will love this album.  The signature sound is here: double barrel guitars, drums that attack, and Dave yelling at full volume.  Aside from the signature sound, the album features acoustic guitars, pianos, and strings; Dave also sings.<br /><br />This album: breath-taking and astonishing.  This album is epic (albeit 12 tracks).  Long live the Foo Fighters!

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Of the two Grindhouse films, this was the better offering...but that doesn't mean it's great.  The stunt sequences are, without a doubt, amazing, and hearken back to the days of Bullitt, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, anishing Point, and the French Connection (which are also all mentioned in the film in a bit of shameless name dropping), but the movie tries too hard to recapture that same feeling. The nod was nice, but you don't have to try and DUPLICATE th classics.  And, honestly, I only plan to watch the last half of the film or so ever again, the beginning is just...well, too much wasted film and vulgarity for the sake of being vulgar.  The beginning is pretty much pointless.  I was SO excited to see the special features on this DVD.....until I watched them.  Tarantino just doesn't know how or when to shut up.  I mean, seriously.  I felt like all he did in each segment was try to convince us why, in his mind, he's the world's greatest filmmaker.  I would have rather SEEN more about how the stunts were done than have Quentin extrapolate on how cool he thought they were and how cool he was for getting these stunt drivers together and why he thought in a few years this driver was going to be everywhere.  So...3 stars out of 5.

B000002KBU|5.0|Joni,  Needs no introduction, to us old folk. I am 45 years old. She is and always has been \\"the Bomb\\", my daughters words.  I have always worshipped Joni and when I hear her singing one of her classics from this \\"album\\", or any other, she moves me(not CD or ipod fodder).  In my line of work, trauma physician, she allows me to focus and \\"get er done\\" as a country comedian might be apt to say.  She has a calming effect as well as a space in my heart that few have entered. My father ,and mentor, who was professionally trained for opera, would ALWAYS stop when she sang and sometimes hold me and cry at the emperic beauty of her voice. He only used to do that when my sister, a professional opear singer, of great reknown, sang.  Joni Mitchell is so many positive things to so many positive people that, in my opinion, her place in many categories of music should be gauranteed \\"hall of fame\\" material and quality.  Love you Joni and all the inspiring moments you have and continue to give.  Dr. Jim Morrow
0312954468|3.0|\\"I love brave and honest men, they are so easily manipulated.\\"    Except for the last parts of this 528-page hardcover published in 1993, I found myself mostly captivated by Wilbur Smith's RIVER GOD: A NOVEL OF ANCIENT EGYPT. The book silhouettes a compelling tale of Egypt in 1780-B.C. embroiled in bitter war and eventually giving rise to a line of princes and pharaohs that lifts Egypt to the peak of its glory. Entirely written in a very unique first-person, we journey through two generations with our main character, a boastful and vain eunuch slave narrator. Although I can't say I really liked his character, Taita's first-person narration strikes a very fresh appeal: he's a eunuch slave, he's vain, he's brilliant, he's artistic, he's compassionate, he's vengeful, and he loves like a man. Ultimately, he's very human. In the epic RIVER GOD, we're privy to political intrigue, conspiracy, love, war, violence, kingdoms lost, despair and triumph. We read about an Egyptian civilization turned upside down with the advent of a new technology (wheel), and the introduction of a new animal (the horse). I enjoyed the battle warfare and the passionate moments of love between Lostris and Tanus. The book can be violent at times, and if you're sensitive to slavery, you may not like this historical tale of ancient Egypt.    Possible SPOILERS ahead.    Although Wilbur Smith packs some page-turning enthralling moments, I found the last 50 pages overwhelmingly melancholy. After a heart-wrenching love story spanning most of the first half in this novel, I couldn't take the sad ending. Taita's self-aggrandizing commentary wearied me and his love for his mistress Lostris as a man irked me. Granted, these are very human emotions especially for a handsome, brilliant man castrated after he's enjoyed a woman's passion, but I was begging for some other perspective in this 528-page Egyptian epic. I especially wanted Tanus' perspective. From Taita's point-of-view, everyone else is too one-dimensional: Tanus the redoubtable honorable warrior, Lostris the stubbornly passionate Queen, Kratas the jocular ruffian, and even Prince Memnon seems drab. For most of the novel, Lostris affectionately considers Taita her father and brother. At the end, Lostris wishes for a different kind of love with Taita in the next life. Considering the fact that Lostris and Tanus had to hide their passion and love for each other in this life and they never knew each other as husband and wife, I found this last wish of Lostris' especially sad. More so than the deaths. Did she love Taita more than she led on in the beginning? Had Taita not been a eunuch, would she have eventually cast aside Tanus intimately? After a gripping battle in the middle where the invading Hyksos thoroughly rout a well-trained and disciplined Egyptian army, I found our protagonists' retreat back through the cataracts south of the Nile very, very protracted. Only to arrive at a very unsatisfying conclusion. But alas, such is history.    I'm not sure who is the River God in RIVER GOD. Ostensibly, it may refer to Tanus' role in the first half when he's acclaimed Akh-Horus, an Egyptian God. However, our narrator's influence overshadows all other characters here and his love for his mistress Lostris eclipses that of Tanus' love for Lostris... at least from Taita's perspective. The book firmly belongs to our eunuch-slave narrator Taita: playwright, inventor, surgeon, economic investor, astrologist, architect, singer, scholar, and most of all, devoted slave to his mistress Lostris. Since Taita appears to be behind every vital event and innovative thought for Egypt, if there's any god here, it's Taita. What else can you expect from the author of these scrolls?    Mostly captivating and enjoyable warfare/love, I could have done without the second half and the sad, overwhelmingly melancholy conclusion to this novel. Yes, I'm probably a sucker for some semblance of a happy ending.    More ramblings...    One of my biggest problems had to do with the plot device that has Taita scheme to pass off Lostris & Tanus' son as Lostris & the Pharaoh's son. First, I didn't like how Lostris was so amenable to sleep with the Pharaoh after she and Taita discover she's pregnant. I had hoped she would recoil from going to the Pharaoh's bed after her dreamy lovemaking with Tanus, . Eventually, Taita could convince her that sleeping with the Pharaoh would best serve the unborn child's interests and she could begrudgingly acquiesce. As it is, she's too ready to go to another man (the Pharaoh) after Tanus. Secondly, you would think one of Pharaoh's hundreds of other wives would have already attempted to pass off another man's son as Pharaoh's! Taita notes how the sexual appetites of some of Pharaoh's wives knew no bounds, so you're telling me not one of them thought to pass of another man's son as Pharaoh's? Seriously, why does it work for Taita and Lostris?    Worst, the second time Lostris is pregnant, Taita divines a dream to explain her condition without implicating Tanus. Taita dissembles that he dreamed the old Pharaoh resurrected from his sarcophagus in spirit form to impregnate the Queen Lostris. First, it seems ludicrous that this deception wouldn't work on the late Pharaoh during Lostris' first pregnancy yet will work like a charm on a hundreds of others. Secondly, I love how Tanus is too proud and honorable for kingship yet will consent to passing off illegitimate children of his as the previous Pharaoh's. Talk about hypocrisy, I didn't see how Wilbur Smith is able to credit Tanus' character. He won't even marry Lostris after her second pregnancy and assume regency for a short while until Memnon is of age. Tanus' character reeks of a duplicitous air of self-important morality. I just don't get how Tanus justifies deceiving the Egyptian crown with his own children yet won't take a temporary regency? He doesn't care that he'll never be able to acknowledge his own children, and that nevermindother people, but even his own children will not know their own true father? It's actually quite sad, to his last dying day, none of Tanus' children know him as their true father and Tanus makes Taita promise not to reveal it.

B000MX7V5M|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Yeah, it's kinda hammy and goofy at points, but that was Hitch's way of pointing out that this is hollywood entertainment and nothing more. Gorgeous on-location shots on the French Riviera make this also a lovely look back at the height of postwar continental chic. Grace epitomizes graceful, and Cary was rarely more charming. The script is light and breezy, the laughs pleasant and frequent, and the cinematography is Hitchcock all the way, ie splendid.<br />Pure entertainment.
0385486804|4.0|I just want to say that I loved this book.  I respected Chris for sticking with his beliefs.  He took this journey to find something real.  It was the only thing that would make him whole.  I think he knew he would not make it out, and I think he was okay with that.  He was too smart to not know that what he went into the wild with was enough to survive.  I think he felt that when supplies ran out...he would live only as long as his life was supposed to be.  I admired him for being so true to himself.  I also think Chris died feeling he accomplished what he needed to do.  I don't think he would have been happy living a long life in a fairy tale world of \\"things.\\" He died being true to himself.  How many people can honestly say they accomplished that in a lifetime? You have to respect him.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />Another decent Grogory Hoblit film, but with nowhere near the impact of Fallen.<br />Hopkins is usually a good indicator of quality, and he makes this film work.<br />Gosling is solid, does what he's meant to.<br />A good police thriller with some ok surprises, this is good but not great.<br />Hopkins really adds something to every role he plays. Fracture is worth seeing mainly for his typically fine performance.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I did a lot of research of Blu-ray VS HD DVD and Blu-ray has more studio support, more bandwidth, more Consumer Electronic support, Higher bitrate and better PQ/AQ (picture quality / audio quality).  I think people are confused because hd dvd has HD in it's name.  Blu-ray is a HIGH DEFINITION format as well which is superior to hd dvd.  This movie looks great on Blu.
B000002ADT|5.0|5.5 stars<br /><br />Many consider this the greatest jazz album of them all, and they're about right.<br />It's pure musical bliss from start to finish.<br /><br />Trane is fabulous and Adderley is maybe even more entertaining. Miles' intonation, which can be horribly off on many of his recordings, is mostly solid here. (Hey, a missed note is a missed note; Miles is a genius for the groups he formed and for his vision, NOT for his technical mastery. Listen to Diz or Shavers or even Hubbard to hear proper intonation. Sorry, just a pet peeve of mine; I like to hear the note they're trying to hit, not a note a quarter or even half tone away.) He captures many moods, and his mute playing is very effective.<br /><br />  But the highlight and very essence of this record is Bill Evans. Davis admitted later that he made this album due to inspiration from Evans' harmonic and atmospheric conceptions, and it's Bill's genius that floats from this album, even when others are playing. His modalities are what made Miles give the others simple chordal sketches instead of typical melodic heads, and Evans' touch is what inspires the delicacy of many moments here.<br /><br />Bill's intro to Blue In Green is twenty seconds of the finest music I have ever heard. Incidentally, Miles stole this tune from Bill, and never gave him credit, probably stealing a million plus in royalties over the years. It's a variation on Evans' Peace Piece from Everybody Digs, and Miles often admitted as much. Just listen to the other Miles albums with this group minus Evans; they never come near to the beauty here.<br /><br />Supple rhythm from Cobb and Chambers makes this a complete masterpiece.<br />I've been listening to this for almost 30 years and have never tired of it.<br />By any standards, Kind Of Blue is a masterpiece. Thank you, Bill Evans!

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|The first 20 minutes or so are truly riveting. Tense, taut, well-made and quickly paced, it's an action film ready to take off. Buuuut then it slows way down and gets preachy and never pays off.<br /><br />Marky Mark is getting a little better at playing the misunderstood patriot each time out. There are some great lines. Ned Beatty is funny as always (he just cracks me up for some reason, whatever role he plays). Too much violence, but that's what it takes to get big movie funding these days, it seems.<br /><br />I don't know how other reviewers can moan about this being liberal propaganda. I know few true liberals who would support this amount of gun porn, and the notion that a gun will solve almost all problems. Hollywood is awash in these movies now; god only knows how much money the gun and bomb makers give to making these movies, but it's got to be lots. They sure get it back in taxpayer money, times thousands. Great investment!<br /><br />The idea that our government is run by thugs making trillions by putting our soldiers in places we have no business being is hardly liberal. Read some statements by Republican politicians these days. Everyone's getting tired of seeing homeless folks everywhere here while we spend 10 billion a day on a war that most Americans despise.<br /><br />This movie hardly makes that point. It just says that the art of killing is a good one to know. And make sure you have lots of guns.<br /><br />Not exactly left-wing.

0446677450|2.0|A book whose philosophy is near perfect in its amorality. In this self-help business book, Kiyosaki (a Japanese American who grew up in Hawaii) talks about his poor dad (his biological father, a public school teacher who tried to teach the values of honesty and hard work to his son during his life and who never became wealthy) and his rich dad (a local businessman who became his mentor and is probably something of a fictional figure). Kiyosaki admires his amoral rich dad: he even boasts how he paid less taxes than his biological father even though he was far richer. Many of this sort of pop business books end up claiming that personal greed ends up in a bigger public benefit, but this book doesn't even try to make this claim (because of this honesty, I rate this book two stars instead of a single one). As if that wasn't enough, Kiyosaki's business \\"advice\\" (mainly dealing with real estate) is vague and run of the mill (no one will get rich by following this book, but he did get rich rich from writing it, much more than from his business deals).
B000UR366S|5.0|It was in the fall of 1973 when I discovered Joni. Several friends were talking about her Court & Spark album which was soon to be released. When I first bought it, I was hooked; I've been a Joni fan for 34 years and have purchased everything she has ever recorded.    The new Shine CD is pure Joni. The tracks are wonderful and after a couple of listens you will be hooked also. It's so good to have her recording again and the good news is that she has a two record contract, so this won't be the last time she shares her talent with the world.    Joni Mitchell is blessed with many gifts, so THANK YOU Joni, for making music again. See you at the Grammy awards.    matchbox
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" of \\"The Warriors\\" unashamedly emphasizes the comic book nature of the film.<br /><br />Director Walter Hill goes out on a limb to create an alternative reality of gang culture - and succeeds brilliantly.<br /><br />\\"The Warriors\\" is somewhat influenced by Stanley Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" in styling but has a much lighter tone.<br /><br />Acted with conviction by a large cast (no-one plays a weasally villain better than David Patrick Kelly), \\"The Warriors\\" makes brilliant use of New York street and subway locations.<br /><br />Still holds up well after all these years because it stands outside contemporary concerns to explore the timeless themes of survival against the odds and ultimate redemption.<br /><br />Excellent featurettes on the making of the film are included on this DVD.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I refuse to give in to another studio trying to \\"milk it\\" for all the money they can get. They must of took thier cue from the Sci-Fi Channel who are masters at Milking It or Rip You Off 2.5
0393327655|5.0|This book is so much fun to read I read it twice.  Harris writes with passion, erudition, and razor-sharp wit.  His book has forced so-called religious moderates to begin taking responsibility for the zealots they unintentionally shelter, and he has demonstrated that a world with powerfully destructive technologies, such as ours, can no longer afford the luxury of basing policy on tribal superstitions and on supernatural claims that cannot possibly be substantiated with evidence.  Highly recommended.
075640407X|5.0|Great book!  I think it will be a classic in the field of fantasy writing. I was strongly reminded of Ursula LeGuin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy' when reading it. I found the combination of veiwpoints very effective at telling the story and inspiring interest in what is coming next.    I look forward to the sequel.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I was in my local Target Store this past Monday and I came across a copy of Some Kind of Wonderful on DVD FOR $8.99AU  I was in my early teens when this movie was released back in 1987. I remember enjoying the movie and every time I see the 3 lead actors in other productions I think back and remember that he or she were in \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\"  At first I could not remember much about the movie as I had not seen it for over 19 years.  Last night I sat down to view the 80's teen film. I can not tell you how wonderful this movie is. The story line is Typical and Predictable. However as other reviews have mention it is the lead actors that pull of this production.   Watching this gem of a movie took me back to my teen years and remembering why I first feel in love with this production.  This is far the best of John Hughes movies of the 80's. Outstanding even Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.  If you can only have one of John Hughes movies from the 80's, Some Kind of Wonderful would be it.  With a wonderful cast and soundtrack at a great price you can not go wrong.    NOTE For Parents: This movie has Course Language which is what gives the movie its rating.
B00000JHAU|5.0|You think you heard all the good music from the 90's there was to hear? Guess again. This album will make you orgasm and feel pangs of lost loves just because of how sweet and endearing it is. Incredible to pay attention to is the crossover from \\"Get me away I'm dying\\" to \\"If you're feeling sinister.\\" It's almost as if the two songs are the same thing twisted right in the middle so you come out on the other end feeling like you know something important. As a friend once pointed out to me, once you start listening and loving this album, you will learn all the lyrics and enjoy it even more because of that.  Note: there are no guitar solo's. If you aren't willing to accept a little harmonic/folk aspect into your life then stray yourself, now. This album is incredibly beautiful and delicate, so I would strongly urge one to listen to it beforehand. If you have an overarching general adoration for all music that sounds good, not simply pop but sweet sounding music with integrity as well, get this. It may just change your life and motivate you to see belle and Sebastian before they die...or create a really sucky record that they would play during a concert. All the songs on this album are good. The song \\"Mayfly\\" i have found can be an annoying transition because it sounds like a cheerful hippy with ADD compared to the preceding song. But this is only Because of said transition. By itself, it is alright. Some of these songs will change how you view music, simply because they are that good.
159102594X|5.0|I love fantasy.  But I'm heartily sick of dragons, elves, dwarves,etc.  And if I even see the words \\"dark lord\\" in a book summary, it's back on the shelf in a nanosecond.<br /><br />I found this book an immensely refreshing change from the generic Tolkien clones that flood the genre. It is gritty and yet filled with a wry humor, salted in the right places for a change of pace.  The author also ties in the diverse characters skillfully and with excellent timing, leaving one half guessing and half anticipating outcomes.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the book is the portrayal of the characters: they are human, with all of the both comical and distasteful flaws of humanity.  For example, the warriors are warriors: they aren't handsome (go get a manicure, Legolas), they are covered in scars, missing teeth, foul tempered and ruthless...and yet they have a code of honor of sorts, and one finds oneself sympathizing with them.<br /><br />I recommend this read.
B0001JXQEM|4.0|I was initially drawn to this album because  A. I am a huge fan of the Blue album as well as Pinkerton and  B. My old copy of the blue album was wearing so crappy that the songs had skipped even on my Mp3 player.  If you are simply replacing a faded cd with a new one, go for the deluxe edition-- it's worth it. If on the other hand you are searching for that little bit extra, languep as those along the Mississippi say, then this may or may not be worth it. Granted, it has two versions of Jaimie, which are only available as downloads. I personally prefer owning a cd rather than a download. it also has a fantastic acoustic version of \\"No One Else\\" which is so immaculately endearing as compared to the regular album version. The former increased my appreciation for both songs, however. Get it used from an amazon seller, and it will doubtlessly be worth it. The live stuff on the second disc isn't mind blowing or amazing, but it satisfied me. The last couple songs left me confused, containing rough earlier versions of songs from the blue album, as well as \\"Say it Ain't So (original studio mix)\\" which threw me off why they would but the same song on two cd's. However, if you are in fact THAT weezer fan of incredible caliber buy it. Who knows, perhaps the song \\"Mykel and Carli\\" will strike a chord from your own youthful memories as the entire blue album is attached to mine.
0143034901|5.0|Whenever I read a book I underline key phrases or words that impact me in some way or another. During my recent flight from NYC to Los Angeles I finished a fabulous epic novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. In July, I was vacationing on the Carribean Island of Anguilla and I came across the book inside a basket in the living area of the Cove Castles restort. I started thumbing through the pages and thought it might be something I'd like to read. I was attracted by the fact that it was an epic Gothic-type novel that had spent two years on SPAIN's best-seller list. In the early pages a critic wrote that like A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION it is an ultimate love letter to literature. I found that to be true. The more lines I underline will determine the goodness of the book (for me). And so, I now share with you to decide.<br /><br />Here are the fabulous LINES in the book that captured me:<br /><br />\\"Some things can only be seen in the shadows.\\"<br /><br />Few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart.<br /><br />A secret's worth depends on the people from whom it must be kept.<br /><br />...frilly words.<br /><br />Nations never see themselves clearly in the mirror, much less when war preys on their minds.<br /><br />I bought the book on a whim. The title seemed suggestive.<br /><br />That book taught me that by reading, I could live more intensely.<br /><br />I wondered what on earth she saw in me that could make her want to befriend me, other than a pale reflection of herself, an echo of solitude and loss.<br /><br />To truly hate is an art one learns with time.<br /><br />His favorite language was money, the rest was neither here nor there.<br /><br />\\"Age--the price we all must pay.\\"<br /><br />People tend to complicate their own lives, as if living weren't complicated enough.<br /><br />\\"Presents are made for the pleasure of who gives them, not for the merits of who receives them.\\"<br /><br />If you ever have a daughter--a blessing I wouldn't wish on anywone, because it's Murphy's Law that sooner or later she will break your heart--if you ever have a daughter, you'll begin without realizing it, to divide men into to camps: those you suspect are sleeping with her and those you don't.<br /><br />\\"Nobody knows much about women, not even Freud, not even women themselves. But it's like electricity: you don't have to know how it works to get a shock on the fingers.\\"<br /><br />Cinemas are full of lonely people, I thought. Like me.<br /><br />Disamred, I realized how easily you can lose all animosity toward someone you've deemed your enemy as soon as that person stops behaving as such.<br /><br />I slipped on my trademark angelic smile.<br /><br />I can assure you without a shadow of doubt that the girl was no apparition. I could even describe her smell. Lavender, only sweeter. Like a little sugar bun just out of the oven.<br /><br />Real women are won over bit by bit. It's all a question of psychology.<br /><br />The female heats up like an iron. Slowly, over a low heat, like a tasty stew. But then, once she has heated up, there's no stopping her.<br /><br />If you really want to possess a woman (or man), you must think like her (or him), and the first thing to do is win over her (his) soul. The rest...is a bonus.<br /><br />If you want problems, you'll get them. Life isn't like novels, you know. In Life you have to take sides.<br /><br />To go in pursuit of your dreams...<br /><br />All I wish is for you to be happy...that everything you aspire to achieve may come true.<br /><br />At the bottom of the cupboard, I kept an old tin cookie box, a treasure chest of sorts. There I stored a menagerie of useless bits of junk that I couldn't bring myself to throw away: watches, and fountain pens damaged beyond repair, old coins, marbles, wartime bullet cases I'd found in the park, and fading postcards.<br /><br />...hit songs by the celebrated crooner Antonio Machin.<br /><br />The leopard cannot change his spots.<br /><br />If a fly finds its way into his shop, he'll open the door and windows wide so that the insect, one of God's creatures, is swept back by the draft into the ecosystem.<br /><br />The trouble is, there are some low moments, and when those strike close to home everything looks blacker.<br /><br />The only card I could play was to tell the truth.<br /><br />He would stare at you without saying a word, and you wouldn't know what he was thinking, and so, like an idiot, you'd tell him things it would have been better to keep to yourself.<br /><br />He gave the impression that he was one of those people who cannot be happy anywhere.<br /><br />He was a very private person, and sometimes it seemed to me that he was no longer interested in the world or in people.<br /><br />He was living in the past, lockied in his memories. He lived within himself, for his books and inside them--a comfortable prison of his own design.<br /><br />Time is a great healer.<br /><br />His soul is in his stories.<br /><br />\\"We exist as long as somebody remembers us.\\"<br /><br />\\"Someone once said that the moment you stop to think about whether you love someone, you've already stopped loving that person forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't be offended, but sometimes one feels freer speaking to a stranger that to people one knows. Why is that?\\"<br />I shrugged, \\"Probably because a stranger sees us the way we are, not as he wishes to think we are.\\"<br />\\"And how do you see me?\\"<br />\\"Like a mystery.\\"<br /><br />At last I managed to retrace my steps within the tangle of corridors and tunnels until I entered a narrow passage that felt like a gangway stretching out into the gloom.<br /><br />\\"You can see a mile off that she's worth a million bucks, but the crux of the matter is this:<br />is she the sort who makes one fall in love or the sort who merely stirs up the lower parts?\\"<br /><br />In good time you'll see that sometimes what matters isn't what one gives but what one gives up.<br /><br />Only three or four things are worth living for; the rest is manure.<br /><br />Love is a lot like pork: there's loin steak and there's bologna. Each has its own place and function.<br /><br />Money is like any other virus: once it has rotted the soul of the person who houses it, it sets off in search of new blood. In this world a surname is less lasting than a sugared almond.<br /><br />Like old cities, Barcelona is a sum of its ruins. The great glories so many people are proud of--palaces, factories, monuments, the emblems with which we identify--are nothing more than relics of an extinguished civilization.<br /><br />Greed will corrupt us all in the end.<br /><br />Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.<br /><br />Few things are more deceptive than memories.<br /><br />\\"The fragrances of the eternal feminine no longer overpowers me the way it mesmerizes you. At my age the flow of blood to the brain has precedence over that which flows to my loins.\\"<br /><br />\\"People who have no life always have to stick thier nose in the life of others.\\"<br /><br />\\"Life flies by, especially the bit that's worth living.\\"<br /><br />I imagined she was thinking that I was dying of curiosity and impatience, so I decided to adopt a nonchalant air, making it very clear that if she wanted to play mystery games with me, she had every chance of losing.<br /><br />\\"I believe that nothing happens by chance.

B000SNUMC0|2.0|For all you giving this great reviews I really believe that I got a different CD when I purchased mine.  I bought Framing Armageddon, something wicked Part 1 and completely sucks.  There is literall two good songs on here(#2 and #8)I don't even want to give credit for 2 because it's basically riffs and melodies from the old album.  People, let me let you in on secret, THE RIPPER SUCKS, get it through your head.  If he was a good singer/musician he wouldn't be thrown around like a two dollar whore from band to band.  He reaps the benefits off of great singers.  Glorious Burden was great because he wasn't involved in the making of it, he came in shut his mouth and sang very controlled and it was OK.  Now, he's on this album from the beginning and you can tell, it sucks.  Don't say it's great just because it's Iced Earth.
B000E1ZK5A|2.0|The HD DVD is a very fine transfer, and the audio is great.  That said, this movie follows in the fine tradition of Hollywood doing a lame imitation of a great foreign film.    Where Das Boot strove for claustrophobia, along with a sense of humanity, U-571 delivers a story full of explosions but devoid of accuracy or emotion.  In the end, you don't really care who lives or dies.    That kind of says it all, except that if you're interested in naval realism, don't expect if from torpedo shots that make miraculous hits, and depth charges that pop every second for, oh, it seems like minutes.  And the back of the German \\"destroyer\\" seemed to look a lot like the low rounded back of a tugboat, which was odd as the destroyer in the combat sequence looked credible.
0205313426|5.0|The book was in wonderful condition.  It arrived in a timely manner.  I would buy from you again.
0393317552|3.0|Though erudite and crammed with information, some of it a bit arcane, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\"suffers somewhat from a blunted point of view. Is the author trying to tell us that some of our assumptions concerning the rise of cultural norms are over simplified? If so, he might have done so more forcefully with fewer words, more carefully selected facts, and perhaps a more lucid writing style. Do some societies prevail because their native tongue is more efficient and expressive than those employed by other cultures? Following that theme might have made for a more intriguing book. Are there some determinisms at work in every culture which inhibit the fulfillment of its destiny? Maybe the author thinks so, but the massive brush used to paint such a scenario causes the entire work to shimmy through a mass of frequently fascinating material without conclusions. The book's excessive length detracts from its compelling points: we live, some of the time, at the mercy of gigantic forces we do  not control. Do genetics control our formation, or climate, or enormous economic systems? And who can give us convincing answers? Anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists of course come to mind. But what of poets, seers, artists, and theologians? Maybe Jared Diamond knows, but by the time he finishes inundating us with facts, some slightly pretentious, it's hard to tell for sure. I had hoped this book's scope and claim would give convincing guidance. But because it lacks definite focus, it did not.
0789208547|2.0|This would be a wonderful book for Rockwell's fans BUT the poor quality of the printing and the copies of illustrations  made me regret buying it.    It still makes a nice book on the shelf.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Wonderful release.    I could expound upon what ISN'T included here...but let's rate what IS.  For only the third time since 1971 (Biding My Time, Embryo, When the Tigers Broke Free) Pink Floyd has released unreleased material; for the first time ever, SYD ERA unreleased material, and two tracks at that:  an unknown take (6) of Interstellar Overdrive, which is sensational.  And a very different version of Matilda Mother with the Belloc lyrics (previously only glimpsed from a short live fragment), different arrangement sans the familiar mid-song splice & with a vocal middle-eight, and newly revealed vocal and lead guitar layers on the final verse.  The nerdiest Syd/Floyd nerds never knew these existed, and they're worth the price.      Contrary to a previous poster's conception that the mono mix is some new bastardization, it dates to 1967 just like the studio version we've always loved.  As such, it's a truly alternate mix/vision of the album that reveals alot of different sounds.  I won't say it's superior to the stereo, but since it's new to me, it's definitely the mix I've been playing.  Pow R Toc H is quite different.  I do prefer the mono Interstellar finale, which goes lighter on the headphones-only panning fury.  As yet another alternate experience, we also get the French EP Interstellar mix~ one of the album version's source takes without overdubs~ in  official CD quality at last; pity it still fades out, but so glad to have it.    The early singles sound worlds better here than on the 90's \\"First Three Singles\\" disc; Arnold Layne has never sounded this good.  And the remastered stereo Apples & Oranges sounds better than any mix ever has (probably my least favorite Barrett song, and I'm loving it).    I've only had the very first cd release of Piper, so the remastered stereo album icings the festivities.  Therefore, on artistic & sound grounds, five stars all the way, and here's to what I hope is only the beginning of the opening of the vault.    As to whatISN'T here~  surprisingly, the single mix of Flaming, with the drums pounding thru the instrumental break (otherwise, I prefer the album mix anyway).  No unreleased songs could be a good sign, one can dream that some Relics 2 might be planned; or at the very least a limited edition Saucerful that includes Scream Thy Last, Vegetable Man, Beechwoods (c'mon guys, even without vocals it's fantastic), and a few other bits in addition to the 68 singles.  Committee main theme, slow & fast versions, anyone?    Back to reality...supposedly few Piper session bits survive.  Specifically, the master tape for She's a Millionaire~ the one true lost Piper outtake that no one ever seems to clamor for~ reportedly no longer exists.  But you can't tell me Nick Mason doesn't have an acetate!  Geez, does everything have to be perfect quality or nothing with the Floyds?  Same with Lucy Leave...after 40 years, the circulating acetate is GOOD ENOUGH for gifting the historical record.  Likewise, with some technical magic, the acetate of Currant Bun with original lyrics.      But that's all wishful thinking.  I LOVE this release!!! Lack of liner notes/recording info is my only true complaint--but the Syd notebook is quite the consolation prize.  Well done, guys, & THANK YOU.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This is an updated review which was originally written in 2003 before \\"Music For Airports\\" was remastered and reissued:<br /><br />Brian Eno's \\"Music For Airports\\" is an exquisite piece of beauty that still holds up since its initial release nearly 30 years ago. It was the very first album to labeled as 'ambient music' and has gone on to inspire numerous imitators. Even today, the album is used as background music for therepeutic purposes in many hospitals.<br />The album consists of four lengthy pieces which are titled numerically. The first, \\"1/1\\", is a gently simplistic piano piece with numerous bell like tones enhancing the background. The second piece, \\"2/1\\", consists of an angelic choir of voices whose harmonies were created stricktly by chance. Each note was recorded onto a separate piece of tape by Eno. The tapes of the voices were arranged so that each note would ocurr at random thus creating pure chance harmonies. The end result is a beautiful tapestry of sound which sounds like it were a throughly composed piece instead of the other way around. \\"1/2\\" once again features the voice loops only this time, they are accompanied by acoustic piano. The style of this piece is very much in the vein of popular instrumental pianist George Winston. The closing piece \\"2/2\\" was performed entirely on synthesizer and is a calming soundscape of pleasant tones. This piece is similar to the solo work of Cluster's Hans-Joachim Roedelius.<br />It is easy to understand why \\"Music For Airports\\" is such a pioneering album. It is a perfect piece of beautiful simplicity that doesn't sounded dated at all. This album was a blueprint for many of today's ambient and 'new age' music. Highly influential and a definitive piece of work.
B000N6UERK|5.0|Denzel rarely disappoints and this is no exception. The movie has some interesting technology in it that makes you think about what is really out there. Also the lead actress is beautiful. Not quite as good as training day to me but still one of the best movies I have seen recently.
B000UFAURI|4.0|On my iPod I have a playlist called Heart Pumpers, and much like the title suggests it is full of songs whose main purpose is to get the blood flowing while on a run, exercising or getting ready for a competition. Featured in this playlist are multiple songs from the Foo Fighters including My Hero, All My Life and Best of You. I may just have to add the band's latest single, The Pretender which in no way embodies the characteristics of the album's title, Echo, Silence, Patience & Grace, with its crushing guitars and unconformist lyrics that could get anyone ready to go into battle after melodic start of song.    The guitars don't get turned down after the bombast of The Pretender as it is followed by a few more straight ahead rockers that should get plenty of play on rock radio over the next year including Let it Die and Erase/Replace. It is then almost a relief when the more melodic Long Road to Ruin, think a pessimistic version of Times Like These, shows up. From there the album goes back and forth between songs that would be on opposite disks of the double album In Your Honor and definitely benefits from the blend over the previous outing.    There are some curveballs on the album including the tongue in cheek title of Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running) that takes pot shots at the emo bands that dominated radio the past years. Of course Dave Grohl and company are having the last laugh as they are still relevant as the emo fad seems to be fading. But the oddest of them all is Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners written by Grohl after meeting a survivor of the mine's collapses and swore to him he would record the song and being a man of his word, here it is. Some might complain the finger picking instrumental but it is a good diversion for the album.    What is missing from Echo, Silence, Patience & Grace a slowed down more poppier song in vein of Big Me, Walking After You, or Next Year. There are some attempts here but Stranger Things Have Happened, Summer's End and the album closer Home just fall short of the greatness of previous tracks except But, Honestly with its slow build to an all out rocker. They do try to switch it up a little with a song like Statues which sounds like an American response to the British Invasion of the sixties. But the second half of the album as a whole just suffers from not having any songs to connect to.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|This album is one of PMG's great albums. From start to finish every composition is fantastic. If you're a Metheny fan and don't have this album then I urge you to pick this album up now!<br /><br />I haven't heard the original of this album in a quite some time, so I can't really compare the original with the remaster. Having read what other reviewers have been saying about the sound, it seems this one is more superior. I can say that listening to it with my own ears it sounds fantastic.<br /><br />The music on this album is very beautiful and I think it contains two of the most beautiful PMG tunes \\"Last Train Home\\" and \\"In Her Family.\\" Both of these tunes conjure up memories of love, triumph, family, and the bond between those close to you.<br /><br />All of the musicians are amazing and Pat, Lyle, Steve Rodby, and Paul Wertico are at the top of their game.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Pat Metheny and to anyone who likes good jazz music.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell has created a work of art for the ages...the ages we live in and will look back on with much nostalgia and regret.     There are artists who try to use their talents and abilities to inform and to educate ...usually with very frustrating results. The masses are like sheep ...following...deaf, dumb and blind...whatever and whoever is the latest flavour.    The sounds of \\"Shine\\" come from the artist herself..nearly all instruments are played by Joni...who produced the album..wrote the songs and did all of the vocals herself. No glossy, over-produced product created to appeal to the fickle tastes of the masses.     This is a recording that will NOT appeal to those \\"sheep\\" who allow their tastes to be dictated. Just as the lyrics referring to the political leanings of those very \\"sheep\\" who allow their political views to be dictated by a \\"regime\\" ...a \\"dictatorship\\"...a mass media controlled by that \\"regime\\" constantly pouring out the propoganda we are all witness to every time we turn on the idiot box or go on the internet.      \\"Shine\\" is a kind and gentle reminder of where we all are now...where we have come from and where we are headed if we don't change course NOW, before it's too late, if it's not too late already.      Joni Mitchell has created a beautiful work of art...for the ages...to enjoy...while we can...if we only stop and smell the roses..now.
B000UR366S|1.0|sorry fans,its just not that good. bad art work, the why bother big yellow taxi 2007.....it is sad when a great artist like joni has lost her spark for great music. there are a few ok songs, but nothing to write home about. maybe next time joni, just you , a piano and guitar. also, try a new producer and do a jonny cash thing. sorry, i love you. but i miss your great writing.

B000SXMQ24|5.0|This is by far the best deal on Amazon's new mp3 download store. It's a great album at an incredible price. $8.99 for a double album with no sales tax and no DRM. You won't find this album in stores for any less than $20 + tax and iTunes sells it for $17 + tax. Like another reviewer, I've been wanting to get this album for quite some time but I'm a cheapskate. But now was the perfect time!
B00000JPYD|5.0|I believe I was 17 when I first purchased this album.  I didn't know who Robin Trower was, I was intrigued by the album cover and the name, so I brought it on a whim.  What a revalation, from Day of The Eagle to a Little Bit of Sympathy the album pulls you in and doesn't let you go.  The vocals are as powerful as the guitar playing and the guitar playing is sublime. I can't think of a better example of rock blues fusion than this album.  If you haven't listend to it in awhile do yourself a favor and play it again, if you've never heard this album buy it, light it up and sit back, you're in for a treat.
0345494997|5.0|You don't have to know much about Frank Lloyd Wright or be \\"into\\" architecture to enjoy this book which is a fascinating look at the history and culture in the early 1900's as well as a complicated love story with the added bonus of a surprising ending.  Although I didn't find any of the characters to be especially likeable, the story of their interactions is riveting. I'm sure FLW was brilliant and this book reflects both his brilliance as well as his very egoistical and conflicted personal side.      It is Mamah's character that is the most interesting.  She is embracing the emerging women's movement and feels that she is seeking freedom from the traditional role of a woman; however, her life revolves around FLW.   Everything she does from leaving her children, moving to Europe, moving back to Wisconsin, living in a house with no heat doesn't seem like freedom but rather a warped dependence and need to be with someone greater than herself.  At one time, Mamah finds herself outside in deep snow where she is \\"knee-deep and snow blind\\" -- pretty much sums up her life experience.    This book is so well written that one can easily envision the sometimes beautiful and sometimes bleak settings and one can feel the tension between the characters come right off the page.  I read this for a book club and our discussion was one of the best ever; I would highly recommend this book.  It is not only a book about FLW, but also a book about society's view of women during this time period.
B000VZKMSO|4.0|Just finished listening to these MP3s on my Mac.  They sounded fine coming out of my Onkyo receiver but I'm not an audiophile so I can't comment on the \\"warmth.\\"  I didn't hear any of the typical bubbly-sounding MP3 encoding errors either.  The Amazon downloader application worked flawlessly with iTunes, the album cover art loaded and everything.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the album title and every song title has [Explicit] on the end of it, just as you see on this page.  And I'm not talking about the little red explicit box you see on iTunes, I mean the actual file names & ID3 tags have [Explicit] in them.  When I rip CDs the CDDB database doesn't toss that in so it's kind of annoying / inconsistent, thus minus one star.
1932100660|5.0|The information in this book is too important for us to remain silent.  All around us are people suffering from disease and misinformation.  Perhaps eating vegan will not solve all our problems but if it saves one person we love from a devastating illness, will it not have been worth it?
B000002HD5|5.0|A previous reviewer nailed this album perfectly: \\"Gentlemen\\" belongs in the same league as masterpieces such as \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" and \\"Tonight's The Night.\\"     A lot of people will read this, and they'll decide it's crazy talk. In fact, it probably IS crazy talk -- if you're reading a single review, or even just a handful of opinions.    Currently, however, there are around 60 reviews of \\"Gentlemen\\" here, spanning the better part of the past decade. And at some point, somehow, \\"crazy talk\\" earned an upgrade to \\"serious consensus\\": \\"Gentlemen\\" really is THAT good.     Consider also that today, nearly two decades after The Afghan Whigs recorded \\"Gentlemen,\\" this record still sounds as if it could have been released last year -- or, for that matter, last week. Very few albums, classic or otherwise, avoid sounding dated after so many years -- yet another sign that \\"Gentlemen\\" deserves every bit of the praise heaped upon it here.    Of course, the praise heaped upon \\"Gentlemen\\" adds up to something quite unlike any other record of its era. Is it really possible that this nasty, mean-spirited, semi-obscure sucker punch of an album is the best of its decade and might even be the best of the entire post-punk period? Personally, I wouldn't want to push things quite that far -- but then again, I can't think of a better choice.
B00004RJ71|4.0|While I am not a huge fan of the gang movies, my husband is. After having to watch it for the umptenth time, I have developed a tolerance. My husband thoroughly enjoys this movie and will watch it many more times.
B00005QEO1|5.0|After seeing Aerosmith perform in Rosemont, IL last night (9/24/07), I remembered fondly how much I loved this album when it was released and how it brought the long-overdue comeback of their career(s) back in full force during the late '80s (even more so than its predecessor, \\"Permanent Vacation\\").  Definitely a desert island disc, one to cherish and enjoy for all time! From \\"Love in an Elevator\\" to \\"Jamie's Got a Gun\\" to \\"The Other Side\\" to \\"What It Takes\\" (my personal fave from the LP), there is an energy in this music that harkens back to the classic Aerosmith LPs of the early '70s.      \\"What It Takes\\", in particular, is so much more a rocker-type ballad than \\"I Don't Want to Miss A Thing\\" from later in their career....this kind of song represents, for me, something more closely aligned with \\"Dream On\\" (the ultimate power ballad, hands down!) and with the true nature/spirit of this great American rock band than something as sappy and disposable as \\"I Don't Want....\\".      Buy it and listen to it on a regular basis....
B000UFAURI|3.0|ive been a foo fighters fan since day one, so i know what it is i like about this band and i must say that all of those things are lost with this cd. there are a few songs i enjoy but i dont see them being mainstays in my cd player where as the 1st 3 foo fighters records are or even 'in your honor' disk 1.
B000VFVOX6|5.0|Great epic!  They don't and can't make movies like this anymore.  Picture in this version is sharp and clear.  Since the language is in English, all I had to do was turn off the Korean subtitle.  What can be easier!  And like the other reviewer said, it's in NTSC (playable in North America), which is almost impossible to find but here.
0385340559|5.0|I have enjoyed the seris, and liked this one the best, because of the former team members, they give some real balance to Jack...
B000R7HY0K|4.0|I really didn't pay attention to this movie or the other grindhouse movie when they came out in the movie theaters. So when I saw this on dvd, everything about the movie took me by surprise. Kurt Russell is \\"stuntman mike\\" a serial killer that use his car to kill women he stalks. While the plot isn't that great, the dialog amongst the characters, action, comedy and gore were great. The characters were well developed and there was good chemistry amongst the actors/actresses. The best part is the change in the movie when the hunter becomes the hunted. This will not be a movie for everyone, as most of Tarantino's movies aren't. So it just depends on what type of movie you like to determine if you will like this one or not.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OYC7A8 David Gilmour: Remember That Night - Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]    As with most people who will consider buying this DVD, I have been a Pink Floyd fan for most of my life.  David Gilmour has always been the member of Pink Floyd I was most interested in, maybe because his guitar tone was so unique to him and his solos on live versions of Comfortably Numb are practically religious experiences, but also because, for a musical icon, he seemed reserved, even shy.  He seemed disarming and egoless, which gave birth in me this crazy idea that a musical hero could also be a decent human being.  But who could say?  What is particularly illuminating in this DVD release is the backstage footage of David, his band, his wife, and even his children.  He just seems like a good guy, and happy - an intelligent man writing music that reflects where he is in his life now, rather than having to keep to the \\"Pink Floyd Sound.\\" That said, when he plays the Pink Floyd songs, he makes them sound as good as ever.  His new material is \\"different\\" from Pink Floyd, of course, but is still quite good (especially Take A Breath). The video production is also first rate, clear imaging, with excellent editing and direction.  His backing musicians are mostly people who have played with him during the last two Pink Floyd tours. I can assure you they sound genius.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the concert footage and especially the extra features.  This DVD release exceeded my expecatations in every way.  I know you'll enjoy it, too.

B000003CMB|5.0|Recorded in 1971, when the Allmans were arguably at the peak of their powers, At Fillmore East is the sound of a great rock band tearing it up on stage. At their best, these songs bristle with white-hot intensity and smoldering energy. The music is tight, passionate, and sublimely rockin', a masterful combination of rock `n' roll with elements of blues, country, and even jazz. Indeed, there are moments of outright transcendence on this album: just listen to that dreamy, mournful take on \\"Stormy Monday,\\" in which lead guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts build an oceanic, atmospheric drizzle around Gregg Allman's gospel-tinged vocals, before the whole band lurches into a swinging soul-inflected boogie. There's also an absolutely raucous reworking of \\"Statesboro Blues,\\" which features some stinging leads and fiery vocals.  \\"Done Somebody Wrong\\" is a bare-bones blues rocker with some truly blood-boiling solos. \\"You Don't Love Me\\" is a grinding, shape-shifting blues-rock epic that features some absolutely ridiculous guitar pyrotechnics, while \\"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed\\" builds from a jazzy dreamscape to a volcanic soul-rock jam. Best of all is \\"Whipping Post,\\" a work of sheer cathartic power in which Duane and Dickey's guitars howl with anger and anguish, articulating a lifetime's worth of heartbreak and abuse.<br /><br />The album's only true weak point is \\"Hot `Lanta,\\" which meanders for over five minutes without ever really catching fire. And to be fair, \\"You Don't Love Me\\" does have a few uninspiring moments (but the good ones make it worthwhile). But there's enough great stuff here to earn this album five big, shiny stars. R.I.P., Duane Allman.
0393964582|4.0|It is a classic and, therefore, deserves a close reading. Norton editions are great. The text size is good, the print tends to be first-rate, and the critical essays usually include classic essays and major critics. This doesn't strike me as being worthy of the \\"A\\" list of literature, but that is a prejudice. I can't really accept any genre lit on the list, including detective, gothic, or science fiction. It is an interesting sample of this period, but I didn't get a lot out the the book itself. For one thing, the atmosphere of doom and gloom doesn't work for me. Everyone is sick and morbidly depressed and sad. This is not explained and I don't think one can easily guess. The writing works, sure, but I don't find the prose style uplifting or thrilling, as writing. The story is very familiar. As a child of the 60s, I remember well watching reruns of the classic film on TV. It is hard to divorce the brilliant film from the wordy novel. The film has some brilliant set-pieces. The novel has a lot in it and it certainly can and should be read at multiple levels, but in the end it is Victorian intellectual thought of the low order. There are other, better thinkers and novelists of far greater talent.
0060557818|5.0|Gaiman has this way of creating delightful stories even though they might contain less than delightful content: such as biting the heads of off live rats, bloody torture, and sifting through human sewage with a net.  This is true in Neverwhere, where the story often turns violent.  Somehow, though, it doesn't leave any feeling of nervousness or disgust, which is what grounds this type of story in Fantasy and out of Horror.<br /><br />I'm not sure how he does it, but I believe it might the wondrous and complex worlds that he creates: in Neverwhere, this world is \\"London Below\\", a pseudo-real subterranean world in the tunnels and sewers under London.  There are many interesting things happening, that the brutality of certain scenes is somehow made more palatable.  Dont get me wrong - this is not a gore-fest, but there are very violent moments, as well as moments of extreme emotional distress for some of the characters... but there's no lasting sting.  I associate it with a fine Single Malt: there might be a smokey or even sharp flavor to start, but the finish is pure velvety smoothness.<br /><br />Another reason that Neverwhere appealed to me is the characters: each was a hard-survivalist on the surface (a requirement of living in the dangerous world below London), but they all had a depth to them that quickly revealed the heart under the hard exterior.  I found myself liking every character, no matter how small their part in the story.<br /><br />I highliy recommend Neverwhere, alhtough it may not be as suitable for younger readers as, say, [[ASIN:0061142026 Stardust]]
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I only ever owned the vinyl copy of this classic before recently purchasing it on CD, so I cannot comment on the previous re-worked CD release that is berated by previous reviewers. Eliminator may represent the bands commercial zenith, but for me this is the definitive album of one of the most enduring bands. Not that the later albums are without merit, but they seem to have been aimed at the wider audience. Over produced? Too much polish? On these albums the guitar work seems to have been held back. This album finds Billy Gibbons at his raw sounding bluesy best. It almost sounds like they have just returned from some downtown bar and decided to have a jam! Favourites for me are Move Me On Down The Line, La Grange and what was a teenage anthem for us, Beer Drinkers and Hell raisers, but maybe the best of all, the sublime Jesus Just Left Chicago. With the added bonus of a couple of live tracks thrown in, this is a must. Great stuff!!
0739481320|5.0|I just had to add this to raise the three star rating this book doesnt deserve. The last reviewer is wrong in so many ways. This book IS a necessary thing. It DID need to be confronting, as we are now at the point where we have to say \\"ënough is enough\\".     Religion is ridiculous, primitive, dangerous, yet at time highly amusing (i enjoy laughing at how such intelligent beings can believe in utterly preposterous and unsubstantiated rubbish. Its great.)    The world needs to change. This is the book to do it, and if it doesnt, well then we are all screwed.
B000UR366S|5.0|I've found that a lot of Joni's albums take a few listens before they really hook me. This new one struck me on first listen. What a beautiful collection! An instant classic!
B00006F83Y|5.0|THough it's been five years since it's release and since I've owned it, I keep revisiting this album. Though the last two have been very good, this one is better than good. I've become extremely disillusioned with modern music and was starting to fear rock, especially hard rock, had entirely died... when I heard this record I realized that one hard rock group remained, and what a group it is. These tracks are monsters. The guitars are brutal, the lyrics range from profound to hilarious to deliciously weird. This album is more than a breath of fresh air, it's a hurricane! Though the only track most have heard off of this album that don't own it is the killer \\"No One Knows\\" (which boasts one of the best riffs ever), don't be fooled for one second into thinking this album is just a bunch of lesser sisters of that song... the whole thing roars, but it also rewards repeated listening. The orchestration is great, the musicians are wicked, and every song is a keeper. For King Crimson fans, \\"Mosquito Song\\" may remind them of some Crimson tracks, and in it's own way, despite what others may think, I think it's a killer track and shows how much diversity there is in the typeof songs the group is really capable of. Of course the group is essentiall Josh Homme since the rest of it constantly changes (just like King Crimson, who outside of Robert Fripp-the band's leader- always changed personnel).
1596590688|5.0|Blue Ocean Strategies are responsible for HUGE amounts of wealth having been generated by many people and many companies.      However, these CD's are delivered with NO Narrative and since the concepts in the book are shared using diagramatic tools which clarify the text; listening can some times be trying and laborious.    Getting past that will reward you with a whole new way to think of markets and marketing.    I recommend them for those interested in the subject for more than just entertainment.  You'll want to read the book to get the part you miss.

B000H7JCIW|5.0|What can I say about Liza. Nothing.    She's the best singer I ever saw.    This DVD is amazing. Buy it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Once you listening to just a few seconds of the opening song Angel of Death you will be blown away.  For the next 26 minutes you will experience an adrenaline rush like no other.  Dave Lombardo's drumming on this album is the very best drum sound I have ever heard.  Igor Cavalera from Sepultura is the only other drummer that even comes close.  Forget Lars from Metallica this is much heavier.  Tom Araya's vocals scream out the mood so clearly its scary.        Just about every friend I know, remembers exactly  where they were at, and what they were doing when they first heard this album played.  My brother wore out his cassette tape playing the album so much back in the 1980's.       This album is the ultimate stress reliever when you are pissed off or had a day from hell at work. You come home to your girlfriend yelling about something.  All you want to do is drink a beer and blast Reign in Blood to make all your troubles fade away.  Reign in Blood along with South of Heaven and Season's in the Abyss should be in every heavy metal fans collection.
B00000IN5G|5.0|This is my favorite Children of Bodom CD! It's probably their most neo-classical CD, and i just love that! I think this CD also sounds kind of black-metalish though, but doesnt really have an extreme black metal vibe to it as it sounds more power and melodic death metalish. But to put in general this is a must have for neo-classical metal fans.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell has been my favorite singer since I was 18 years old, but I have to admit that I'm rarely immediately blown away by her new releases.  The last time was the amazing \\"Turbulent Indigo\\".  After such a long wait for new material, I was in equal parts excited to finally hear it and nervous that I wouldn't like it.  I needn't have worried.    \\"Shine\\" is a wonderful CD!    Having listened to it four times already, I can honestly say that I love it.  Starting out with the wonderful instrumental \\"One Week Last Summer\\", \\"Shine\\" remains lovely and poignant throughout.  Some might be quick on the draw to dismiss it as just more of Joni whining about the world's woes as she sees them, but if you take the time to listen to the lyrics (and read along), you'll find that she is dead on.  Something very different from her previous social commentary is the fact that, while Joni does decry the world's injustices, the overall tone is empowering... we all have the ability to change the course of fate.  The song \\"Shine\\" really sums up the whole idea (or at least as I interpret it)... that whether what comes at you is good or bad, it's up to you to deal with life in a positive way.  This is probably the most optimistic set Joni has ever done.    To my mind, there is not a false word or false note on here.  Lyrically, I would say that Joni is as strong as ever, and musically, the sound is completely fresh, very atmospheric, and extremely well played and produced.  As for my fear that Joni's voice would be weak and whispery, I actually think she sounds better than she did on \\"Taming the Tiger\\".      Each of the tracks on \\"Shine\\" stands on its own, but played in sequence they make for a really great set.  One admission, and I'm probably on my own here... \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" is the one slightly low point for me.  While lyrically it fits the package and musically restyled it falls into place, it has never been my favorite Joni song (save the really great version she did in her concert \\"Painting With Words and Music\\").  It's not a bad cut... it just doesn't thrill me like the rest of the CD.    The packaging is really a departure for Joni.  I always look forward to her paintings, but the photography is really stunning (or maybe it's just the dancers... geez, I need to work on my abs).  There is a great clip on YouTube that has excerpts of an interview with Joni as well as bits from the ballet... definitely worth seeing.    All in all, I am thrilled with this CD, and so happy to see Joni in top form... thanks for this!
1572814349|4.0|First off I agree with reviewers: Dr.Mary G,J.Boyer,El.Brujo regarding the deck's beauty and Kat's artwork;however since I am skin-sensitive to actual gold which gives me a second degree burn in the skin. I would have to use latex gloves to handle the cards per se.  However after reviewing the deck I was pleased by its artwork and beauty including the gold edges. The book has a good Horseshoe Spread I like which I would like to include in my revised edition of my spreadbook under revision now...And I will give credit to Kat in my books under manuscript now as I have over 90 tarot kits in my research drawers now.  This is rated by me as a beginners tarot to start with..Buena Suerte!!!
B000VPUIA6|3.0|Basically this an extended music video with a deliberately implausible plot but fantastic music. It cleans up better than \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (low budget embarrassment but yet again, fantastic music). Why is \\"Let It Be\\" still not on DVD, yet we get this remastered? A harmless way to enjoy the soundtrack with some visuals, but not something charming enough for repeat viewing (e.g. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\").
B000001FTD|5.0|Everything about the album has already been summed up by other peoples reviews on this website.  For any new metal heads out there or anyone who enjoys metal music, this is a great place to start.  This is a pure 5 star album. The music has aged well and sounds heavy just like it should be.       Anthrax is one of few bands from the 1980's that are still incredible live.  I saw them play in 2005 with Megadeth on the Gigantour and they blew Megadeth (Dave Mustaine and 3 other guys) right off the stage.  They played Indians, Caught in A Mosh, and Among the Living off this album and it sounded raw just like it was 1987 when it came out.    I highly recommend seeing this band live now that Joey is back in the band.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This movie is very funny. It also has great, upbeat music with a great message. This movie says to accept people the way they are no matter how different they are. This is definitely a DVD to buy!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae sings effortlessly and with heart.  What more can I say?  Wonderful...wonderful...wonderful.
B000002KJM|5.0|For anyone who is interested, the vinyl version of this album is available here at Amazon, as well as the cassette version. I would recommend going either route instead of the CD version, since, to this day, the only version of ZZ Top's First Album is still the late eighties remastered version that appeared on the ZZ Top Six Pack set (AKA The ZZ Top Sucks Pack, by me, ever since I purchased it in 1992.)<br /><br />Although Rhino has re-remastered two albums from the sucks pack (Fandango and Tres Hombres) making them sound fantasticly like the original releases, the other four still are completely void of any musical emotion whatsoever, reminicent of the awful Recycler album. This is because the albums were completely remixed in the late eighties to make them sound like albums recorded in the late eighties (ugh, wasn't that rocks worst period ever!?... the answer is yes.)<br /><br />With amazing imagery, and a unique sound all its own, the vinyl version of ZZ's First is the type of record that makes the turntable bounce from side to side when you drop the needle. However, the CD version won't make your CD player do a god damned thing. At least not until Rhino does something to correct this. Great lyrics like \\"She was a sleazy mess in her beat up dress...\\" or \\"If her lovin' don't kill me, I know her husband will...\\" are wasted on that silver peice of plastic. SO the black wax is definately the way to go. Although the release date on it says 1990 here at Amazon. Maybe you should check out a used record store, or a yardsale instead, just to be safe.
0307277674|4.0|This is one of those books that I avoided reading for a long time. Sure, it was popular, and it had an intriguing concept, and a lot of people thought it was very good. A lot of writer people, however, denigrated the book, saying it had too many adjectives and adverbs, among other things. When I finally did get around to reading it, I was surprised to find myself drawn inexorably into the story.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code begins with Robert Langdon being called to the Louvre museum, where there has been a bizarre murder. Langdon, an expert symbologist, winds up becoming both a suspect in the case and the only investigator who really understands it. Together with Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer who turns out to be the victim's granddaughter, Langdon sets off on an urgent quest to solve the crime. As Langdon and Neveu race from clue to clue, the plot unfolds to huge proportions, including murderous conspiracies and secret societies, with nothing less than the Catholic church at stake.<br /><br />As a story, The Da Vinci Code is very well done. It captures the reader's interest from the start and holds it throughout Langdon and Neveu's headlong dash through the night. The characters are well drawn, if awkward in places. The locales are exotic, and the settings intricately detailed. The plot itself is a masterwork. The fact that this book has spawned so many other books to discredit it is testimony to the authenticity and credibility of its voice.<br /><br />To be honest, there are places in the book where the structure of the sentences falls into a pattern that is humorous and annoying if you recognize it. The vast intricacy of the plot and the convincing detail of the setting, however, more than compensate for any deficiency of character or sentence structure. As a writer, I found much more to covet here than to ridicule.<br /><br />All in all, I think The Da Vinci Code is a new classic. Many people still discount the work, but I'm not sure how a true bibliophile could justify avoiding it. The book has become a phenomenon, an icon of modern success in the book industry. And, underneath it all, it really is a good story.e book has become a phenomenon, an icon of modern success in the book industry. And, underneath it all, it really is a good story.
B000002B7U|2.0|First thing, I do feel that Ozzy did sell out a bit for this album, like other people on this website have said.  But its the music that matters not how someone dresses.  The only great songs on this album are Secret Loser and Shot in the Dark.  Both songs stand out among the rest of the filler songs on this album.  The album seems rushed only about 22 minutes long or so.      I think Ozzy really overdid his last album Bark at the Moon using to many keyboards and ballads.  I mean just listen to the second half of that album it sucked.  I am a fan of Ozzy's solo career, but I am tired of all the hype of his reality TV show.  Not all of Ozzy's music aged well and this album is a case in point.  The album lyrics focus on cold war fears of nuclear holocaust.  The drumming and sound is just weak all around on this album.  It does come off as warm and fussy bunny like, instead of kicking you in the balls while banging your head.      He would get that edge back on his next record No Rest For The Wicked followed by No More Tears.  I just think Ozzy is getting to much exposure on his life instead of where it belongs on his music.  Like the Bob Dylin syndrome, not everything he puts out is going to be 5 star quality.
B000UR366S|5.0|I'll keep this review very simple. Long time Mitchell fan and this one<br />doesn't dissapoint. Its great to hear Joni play so much piano again, she<br />means business on these recordings. Passionate, haunting and sad in parts, she hasn't<br />lost her humor and bite and her singing is deeply felt. Another of Mitchell's<br />excellent recordings over the years and  a welcome return of a true<br />pioneer of the singer/songwriter generation. \\"If I had a heart\\", \\"IF\\",<br />\\"Night of the Iguana\\", \\"Hana\\", \\"Bad dreams\\" are some of the many highlights. This one makes you think without turning you off, its a<br />perfect mixture of message and music.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|This album is so awesome, they really stepped it up and just sound amazing on this album. Its fast, heavy, melodic, thrashy, and F'n Brutal! BDM despite being from USA and starting out in the Hardcore/Metalcore scene really know how to write good metal songs.
B000B7TLT8|5.0|It's a great movie to start with, has nice menus added for the psp version...  and looks  GREAT on the psp.
B000002B7S|2.0|This album has 3 great singles but not much else going for it.  The title track is an obvious great song, which shows that guitarist Jake E Lee can play very well.  Rock N Roll rebel is also a decent number, so is the last track Waiting for Darkness.  But like Ultimate Sin after this album it is just filled with weak songs.  Come on now Centre of Eternity, Slow Down and So Tired, sound lame today.  I know that all the Ozzy fans reading this will shout bloody murder but come on.  The keyboards really kill the metal aspect of both is album and Ultimate sin following it.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|A novel- if far-fethced- idea for a film based on murder tourism is ruined by such a poor execution.  In its 95 minutes, Eli Roth manages to change genre three times: from soft-core skuzz, to gore, then to action, and all are particular unsatsifying.  But most of all, it just wasn't scary.<br /><br />First off, the main characters are simply too unlikeable for us to care about them.  In the first scene- which takes up 30-35 minutes of the 95 minute run time- our protagonists immediately loose any sympathy they might have with the audience by acting in an incredibly loutish manner in search of booze and women.  This first scene is simply pointless: the soft-core porn contributes nothing to the plot and is there simply to allow people who don't have the guts to buy porn to watch porn.  Although Roth is trying to condemn the vulgar, loutish American- in- Europe stereotype, this opening scene is ultimately appealing to the kind of person Roth seeks to satirize and condemn.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Slovakia- on a true good to be true account of shagging by the bucket-load- they continue their antics. And by this time I'm hoping that they suffer at the hands to these sadists who will save the world from these douchebags.  Of course, the suspcicious departure of the Icelander and a native wearing his jacket doesn't raise too much suspicion, and our heros keep on partying.  Whatever...<br /><br />And now to the snuff part of the film.  So overdone and so fake, it just  didn't raise any scares.  A horror film which isn't scary is a unique if ultimately flawed idea.  But this time we are too bored to care what happens as the least likeable character escapes with a victim- typical Asian cliche, the only one about whom we have any sympathy- on their way out of the hell hole.<br /><br />In all, the first 30 minutes of porn are pointless and it doesn't get any better.
B000002LQR|4.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the second Chili Peppers album to feature the band's current lineup, although guitarist John Frusciante left afterwards and didn't return until before the recording of Californication. It's their most popular record, and it's pretty apparent why. They rock pretty hard, with Flea's famous bass and Chad's drums laying down the backbone while John picks merrily over the top of it and Kiedis provides mostly nonsense lyrics with his trademark funky-rap-voice thing. They are mostly pretty loud, although we start to see some of the softer, mellower stuff that they go towards more and more often as they get older. Raucousness is the order of the day and it's pretty enjoyable here, but I'm thankful for the other songs that break it up a bit and make it seem a little more whole and mature as a piece of work. Mother's Milk has a heavier party atmosphere, with lots of shouted group vocals, while Blood Sugar is more restrained, while still making good use of backup singers that stick out more than they usually do.    \\"The Power of Equality\\" does a great job of announcing Flea's presence as his bass barges into the intro to get things really rolling. The first example of changing the pace is \\"Breaking the Girl\\", which has strumming acoustic guitar, very unusual for this band. \\"Funky Monks\\" is pretty much exactly why I like Chili Peppers, except for the other good things they do. \\"Suck My Kiss\\" has a killer riff and lives off it pretty well. The next few tracks are a solid mix of catchy, funky, and pleasant tunes, leading into \\"Give It Away\\", the band's quintessential song. It's kind of fun in a goofy way but actually one of the lesser tracks on the album. The title track's guitar work isn't Frusciante's most technically proficient but among his most simply enjoyable to listen to. \\"Under the Bridge\\" is another classic song, from the minimal beginning, to the well-sung vocals to a change, to the weirdly affecting choir at the end. \\"My Lovely Man\\" can only be described as groove-tastic. Sorry for writing that. \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" is a bizarre epic of misogyny and musicianship that pretty much ends the album besides a throwaway track. I'll never like this older stuff as much as what they did from 1999 to 2002, but it's still pretty darn good.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|One of the things that makes Deathproof so great is the character development. Kill-seeking, slash-'em-up, gore-lovers hate character development.<br /><br />In your typical run of the mill Horror movie you usually get pummeled with countless deaths of countless B-list actors playing teen aged dysfunctionals; if the killing doesn't start within 15 minutes of the beginning of the movie you're saying WTF. You never really \\"get to know\\" any of the cast; you certainly don't feel a connection to them; and when Jason [[ASIN:B00001MXXP Friday the 13th, Part 2]] comes a knockin' you don't wince from the loss of a character that you got to like; you wince from the spatter. It's exactly what you paid for.<br /><br />In Deathproof, for the first half of the movie you're chillin' with a group of young adults; you're part of the click; you're getting to know some pretty cool gals. Even if you haven't seen the trailer or read the reviews, you have a foreboding sense that something bad is about to happen, and by the time that it does you don't want it to because of the bond that you've developed...which makes anything bad that happens that much worse. (Some other movies that did this well recently were Wolf Creek [[ASIN:B000EOTVU2 Wolf Creek (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] and The Descent [[ASIN:B000IHY9TS The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] .<br /><br />Therefore, Deathproof for me was a very good movie for the same reason that other people might have been disappointed with it.<br /><br />The average amount of stars at Amazon for Deathproof is unfairly skewed to the low side because of disgruntled customers that want the other half of the theatrical double feature release included for free with their purchase [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] . Sorry, folks. That was a gimmick for the big screen only.<br /><br />Speaking of gimmicks, don't adjust your TV; those film scratches in the first 1/2 of Deathproof are part of the intended, deliberate early-70s look. But make no mistake, the film takes place in the current day. And the dialogue couldn't be more snappy and modern...executed precisely by a class-A cast of actors.<br /><br />Deathproof is the sleeper of 2007.early-70s look.

B000UGG39Q|2.0|With each passing album, down the drain they go.  You have to appreciate what these bandmates are capable of but perhaps with a little practice and the help of a production that doesn't hide the talent, this album would have been hands down better than their sophomore release.  Can we keep time here, no.  Has Phil lost his commanding voice, yes.  It's depressing.  This comes from someone who loves what the bands these guys come from do.  Fair warning.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I recall an early viewing of this 1961 classic....The Jets snapping  their fingers at the beginning, the imaginary wedding scene, Oscar winner Rita Moreno's Anita chiding Maria to be home in the 15 minutes (  Like many of my generation, I found it intriguing to see her in something other than \\"Electric Company\\"), Arab's ( David Winters) distinctly wavy blond hair and red nylon shirt, the soles of the hero's sneakers as he makes his final exit....   I write this on the eve of the 50th anniversary of \\"West Side Story's \\" Broadway debut.   Premiering within 24 hours of the real-life crisis at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, this modernized retelling of \\"Romeo and Juliet covers the timely topics of  youthful rivalry and bigotry, and an attempt at love and reconciliation in its midst.   Our story begins in the mid-20th century West Side of New York, where the gang known as the Jets, consisting of the slum area's \\"establishment\\"--white youths led by their leader, Riff (the energetic, back-flipping and comical Russ Tamblyn) gather in a corner of a playground, snapping their fingers in anticipation of a fight.    They begin to stroll away from the playground, and via Jerome Robbin's expressive choreography, display their delight in the thing that gives these disadvantaged youths a sense of indentity  and solidarity: Being a Jet.   Soon enough, there is a  fight between the Jets and their rival gang, the Puerto Rican Sharks, led by Bernardo (George Chakiris), which is soon broken up by Officer Krupke (William Bramley) and Inspector Schrank (Simon Oakland), the latter of whom  does not hide his bias against the Puerto Ricans.   Irritated by the prospect of losing their turf to newcomers, the Jets reaffirm their solidarity in song, and Riff has a consultation with his best friend and  Jets co-founder, Tony (a stunningly handsome Richard Beymer) who despite his days as a gang member, has moved on and taken a job as a delivery boy in a local drugstore run by Doc(Ned Glass), a sweet old man, weary of gang rivalries.   Tony does not agree to partake in an impending rumble, but does agree to meet Riff and the Jets at a dance that evening. He tells Riff about a strange sense of anticipation he has about some mysteriously wonderful event in his life, which Riff suggests might make itself eminent at the dance. Tony's feelings are summed up in the song, \\"Something's Coming\\" (dubbed by Jimmy Bryant).   In the meantime, Bernardo's sister, Maria(an alternately eager, innocent, loving, pious, mournful, hot-tempered and strong Natalie Wood, whose singing is dubbed by Marni Nixon), who was brought to America for an arranged marriage with gang member, Chino (Jose de Vega) is also  anticipating the dance.   The dance is presided over by a social worker called Glad Hand (John Astin) who doesn't succeed in getting most of the members of the opposing gang members or their girls to dance with anyone on the opposite side. But Tony and Maria see each other across the proverbial crowded room, and briefly join hands and speak, before being rent asunder by Bernardo and Chino. Tony learns Maria's name as she is sent home. He walks home from the dance, dazed and singing.   Soon, the the two have an encounter on the fire escape of Maria's tenement house, and they fully express their love in the middle of all the hatred around them.   The Sharks and their girls regale the audience  with the lively number, \\"America\\", in which they express both sides of the coin as nonwhite immigrants in the U.S.; the girls emphasize optimism and freedoms denied them back home, and the boys point out the racism, poverty, and discrimination they still face.   After another confrontation with Officer Krupke, the Jets have their own moment of levity, poking fun at all the reasons psychoanalysts give for their delinquent behavior.   Gathering inside Doc's store and dismissing their girlfriends, the two gangs engage in a war council, in which Tony is a reluctant negotiator. Schrank arrives, expressing distain for the Sharks, and provoking  members of the Jets with reminders of family issues that fuel their anger.  Noticeably, the Jets have better developed characters. Tony Mordente's Action could be the perfect inner city school teacher if he can control his rage, Tucker Smith's Ice seethes with raw charisma, and Eliot Feld's Baby John is a reluctant gang member. In a scene where he cries, and he asks Arab for a handkercheif and Arab asks, \\"What's wrong with your sleeve?\\", we get a complete summary of the life Baby John wants versus the harsh reality of where he is in life.   Maria's co-workers note the change in her demeanor, but Anita witnesses Tony's after-hours encounter with the young seamstress and agrees to keep quiet. The two lovers imagine a wedding, and Tony agrees to stop the rumble.   The reprise of the song, \\"Tonight\\" reveals the desires of all the parties involved and is the segway to the second half of the story. It is a technique later used in the musical \\"Les Miserables\\" with the song, \\"One Day More\\" to great effect.   The rumble ends in tragedy for both sides, making Tony a fugitive from the law. Maria is devastated, but in her grief, still embraces Tony. The Jets grieve their loss, calm down, and try to find Tony. Advice from  Susan Oakes' Anybody's, who embodies the human need for acceptance, proves helpful.   After a bitter falling-out with Anita over her continued affair with Tony, Maria convinces Anita to send a message to Tony and to give their love a chance. But  the Jets attack and nearly rape Anita, driving her to leave a false message for Tony, leading to the story's lamentable conclusion.   But as the players exeunt, we see rivals embrace their commonality, remorse, wisdom gained through tragedy, and a young woman's discovery of strength amid sorrow.   Arthur Laurents' and Ernest Lehman's words, Robert Wise's direction, Stephen Sondheim's lyrics, and Leonard Bernstein's eloquent scoring, which changed the look and sound of musicals forever, combine to give the world an ever-relevant cautionary tale that will be enjoyed for many years to come.

B000UFAURI|3.0|The cover art of Foo's ESP&G reminds one of their 1995 self-titled debut: muted background, centered layout, a weapon overwhelming the space. But if you go in hoping for some of the old Foo magic, you'll be sadly disappointed. We've come to accept the fact that the Foo of old is gone, which is surprising considering how little the band seems to evolve anymore. They try new tricks each time out, sure, but it's all in the same framework as ever. Everything is primed for mass consumption. It's arena-friendly in the sort of way that would make bands like Kansas and Foreginer proud. The productions are slick and uncorrupted. There's so little breathing room in each radio-friendly nugget because they're designed with the same sort of affection we would hope for, but not in the way that we would hope for. Even the softest and gentlest ballads sound like little more than very subdued anthems.    But if you're going to depend on any band earning major airplay to fill an arena, you might as well go with Foo Fighters. After all, they do it better than almost any of their peers by a long shot, and even while we wish for more, the resulting product is almost always satisfying. Grohl and company are older and wiser now; can we really expect the same sort of energy and aggression as before? But to play it so safe is still a deflating realization. The songs are built to be sung along to, packaged for commercial success, and we swallow each pill without choking. It's very easy to like this album. It's near impossible to be passionate about it.    Like most Foo records, this one opens the gates with thrust and gusto as first single \\"The Pretender\\" builds up steam and charges full-speed ahead. \\"Let It Die\\" comes next, following the patented method of a story of two halves: one slowly building but spare and simple, the other galloping and loud, letting the freak flag of rawk fly. \\"Erase/Replace\\" is the standard issue Foo rocker, fun but forgettable and easy going down. They can do appealing acoustic ditties well, too, though. \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\" moves surprisingly quickly for a five-minute plus ballad. \\"Home\\" is a pretty piano ballad that recalls Jackson Browne in a good way. The problems come when they want heavy guitars rolling along on creaky and derivative melodies that would feel more at home in the hands of the Goo Goo Dolls. \\"Long Road to Ruin,\\" \\"Cheer Up Boys, Your Makeup Is Running,\\" and \\"Statues\\" are the prime offenders of these crimes, and they're easily the weakest tracks of an already uneven batch. Even \\"Summer's End,\\" which has an undeniable folk heart sprinkled with good-ol-boy 70s rock flourishes, is a tale of two cities, both at odds, neither happy to share space. Buffalo Springfield could have made it work; Foo just look lost.    That they would try an eclectic collection like this is heartening, though. Their other albums were distinctively marked in niches. Even when early Foo tried to change things up by going the mellow pop route with songs like \\"Big Me\\" and \\"Walking After You,\\" they followed the distinctive patterns of the surrounding material. And In Your Honor had two very divergent styles, but they were separated on opposing sides, each of which were almost TOO \\"samey\\" on either end. But if they think they're doing Led Zeppelin's III by loading the disc with nearly as many mid-tempo numbers as zippy hard rockers, they have to figure out how to do the music in between the extremes. Grohl alone with an acoustic guitar and simple but heartfelt lyrics is fine. The whole band playing fast and heavy with slick but fun gate-chargers is quite good as well. Trying to coast along in the middle ground is a tough mission, one that I wonder if Grohl and the boys are capable of succeeding. I wish it were different--Grohl seems an affable and fun guy, he's a hell of a drummer and no slouch on the guitar, and the rest of the band offers solid support and better--but it's tough to think otherwise anymore.    Best cuts: \\"Stranger Things Have Happened,\\" \\"The Pretender,\\" \\"Home,\\" \\"Let It Die,\\" \\"The Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners,\\" \\"Erase/Replace,\\" \\"Come Alive\\"

B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell is one of my very favorite artists.  Sometimes, she's my favorite.  We sort of grew up together.  And with the release of each new album, people have reacted to it with a mix of fondness as well as disappointment over her not just redoing what she's already done.  She once said something like:  If you stay the same, they distroy you and if you change, they crusify you.  I'd rather be crusified.     On one of her live albums, audience members were shouting out suggestions for the songs that they wanted her to sing.  Her responce was to compare her songs, her children at the time, to the canvus of painters, \\"Nobody said to Van Gogh, 'Paint a Starry Night' again, man...\\"   I approach each new work from her with shaky anticipation.  I remember back in 1976, with the release of, to me her masterpiece \\"Hejira\\", I had never heard music quite like that in my entire life.  Musical landscapes.  I've listened to that album hundreds of times and today it is my favorite album.  \\"Amelia\\" my favorite song of all.  Sometimes, her work is \\"Difficult Listening\\", as Laurie Anderson would say.  To me her most \\"experimental\\" album is '77's \\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\\".  It will still push you today.  It was so totally different from the previous \\"Hejira\\" or the following \\"Mingus\\".  And nothing else can be compared to \\"Dog Eat Dog\\".      Interviewed once Joni said that she couldn't write a hit song if she tried.  Yet she's written many, many of the most incredible musical landscape pieces that have ever been put on either vinyl, 8 track, cassettes, CD or MP3s.  Initial listening is like a download into your brain.        Her first album was released in 1968.  That's nearly 40 years ago.  \\"Hejira\\" was released in 1976.  31 years ago.  Just how many musical painter can say this?  She lightly hits her guitar like a painter putting oil on a canvus, like musical brush strokes.    The real standouts here are the tracks \\"Shine\\" and \\"If\\", which end the album.  Musically and lyrically, they work their way into your brain and are two of her finest tracks ever.    It is SO nice to have her back.  We need her out here...
1426455402|4.0|The short story format was just what I needed. I don't have time to churn through page after page, hoping to find a good stopping point. The large print was a pleasure to read. I was able to use my regular reading glasses and not the coke bottle eyeware. Most of the stories were fascinating and nearly impossible to figure out, but I must admit that I nearly outwhitted Holmes a couple of times as situations become predictable. That is my reason for the score of four. But Holmes ability to observe the slightest nuance never failed to fascinate me, and I highly recommend the book.
B000TUXL2A|3.0|Clearly, Mark has morphed from the former guitar hero of Dire Straits to the understated singer-songwriter. All of the songs here have the characteristic Knopfler touch: good storytelling, good sideman, and crackerjack guitar playing. Wait, that last part doesn't happen here. Other than a few nice comps here and there, you'll be hard-pressed to find any guitar picking--electric or acoustic--anywhere on \\"Crimson.\\" Evidently Mark is saving the finger-flying fun for his concerts.     So I finished listening to this disc wistfully wanting more of the animating force that made \\"Golden Heart,\\" \\"Sailing To Philadelphia,\\" and \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" so unforgettable. Whatever it was--melodies, solos, verve, or simple joie de vivre--the quality that has garnered Mark such a loyal following is not, by and large, here on this disc. Indeed, there were some moments on this disc that made me wonder if I was listening to outtakes of Leon Redbone or (I know, it's sacrilege) Richard Thompson.     That said, there are some brights spots: \\"The Fizzy and the Still,\\" without a doubt, is the standout song of the disc and invokes the old Knopfler magic. \\"True Love Will Never Fade,\\" \\"Punish the Monkey,\\" \\"Let It All Go,\\" and \\"Madame Geneva's\\" are all good. \\"In The Sky\\" recalls \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" or \\"Love Over Gold\\" even if it doesn't quite reach the same heights.    Message to Mark: I still think you're a monumental talent, but next time, could you please step it up a bit?
B000W0A97C|5.0|Ms. Mitchell is one of the (if not actually *the*) lost treasures of modern music. A wonderful, welcome collection from a true musician who has inspired and influenced so many - here's hoping this is the first of many more to come.
1400044162|5.0|It is the late 1960s. In Africa, the small nation of Biafra struggles to establish a republic independent from Nigeria. The world is not paying attention as people are slaughtered, as heroes are born, as classes and ethnic groups clash and fight and flee.    Amidst this backdrop of turmoil, you meet Ugwu, a thirteen-year-old boy just hired as a houseboy by Odenigbo, a university professor and revolutionary. You follow Odenigbo and his girlfriend Olanna as they abandon one house after another, fleeing with Ugwu, trying to stay one step ahead of the front line of the war. You travel with Richard, a young Englishman who considers himself a citizen of this new nation of Biafra, as he navigates the war and pursues Olanna's proud and beautiful twin sister Kainene. You get a glimpse, through these characters, into the chaos and instability that is the daily lives of those affected by war.    Adichie's new novel is ambitious - it manages simultaneously to be both broad in scope and intimate in its details. Her writing is beautiful, and her characters so well fleshed out that you keep thinking about them, wondering what will happen to them, long after the book is done. There is death here, yes, but there is also birth and friendship and lust. There is hunger, but there is also generosity and truth. Adichie does an excellent job portraying the surreal coexistence of the fear and devastation of war with the more mundane, but perhaps even more painful, struggles to maintain some semblance of \\"normal\\" life - meals prepared and eaten, school attended, marriages planned and babies conceived.    Adichie's novel is a window into the past, into a place that most of us have never been. The clash and coincidence of the love story and the war epic render Half a Yellow Sun into the kind of fiction that is often more telling, more evocative of a particular point in history, than any strictly historic account could ever be.    Armchair Interviews says: The book makes you feel the characters struggle in a way that only the best fiction can.
075640407X|5.0|Rothfuss delivers what is probably the most promising debut in the fantasy genre.  Unabashed fantasy without any self-loathing defiance that seemed to be rage for awhile.  Nor any attempt at over done melding of pop culture elements in a failed attempt at creating something new.    Rothfuss takes on such standard fantasy fare that the work should seem stodgy and stalely derivative.  Instead we simply get storytelling at some its best.  Entertaining, interesting and enough detail and intricacy that I found myself hundreds of pages in without realizing it.      The book does have some flaws.  About two thirds in there is a shift in plot slightly that seems a bit too tangental and sudden; though it does come together at the end nicely, it is a bit rougher than I would have liked.      All in all, this is a fantastic debut and one that I cannot recommend enough.  The plot may seem overly familiar to many, but not only does Rothfuss breathe plenty of new life into such material he easily and just a few pages into the work, makes it all his own.

B000KX0IOK|5.0|There are detailed, insightful reviews of Half Nelson in this section. I only wanted to comment on one aspect of the film, the character Frank, played by Anthony Mackie. Frank is the \\"friend\\" who got the brother in prison and is now \\"friends\\" with the little sister Drey.     This character caused this film to be a life-altering event for me. I have known this character in real life, life on the bottom. In real life I did not recognize him as a bad guy. I thought he was a good guy, just as Drey does. Because he is a very nice guy. A sweet guy. A guy who just happens also to take innocence and turn it to his own ends. And it was many moments into the film, almost where the teacher Dunne takes Frank on and tells him to leave Drey alone, that I realized--with a shock--that Frank is one of the most sinister characters I ever read, and his real existence in real people in the real world is equally sinister, and I'd never realized that my own \\"friend\\" had used women like that,like Frank used Drey and her brother, smiling all the while. My whole life I have been as innocent, as needy, as used, as Drey, except I had no good teacher to stand up for me, and I had not realized it until I saw this film. Naturally this makes Half Nelson one of my all time favorite movies, and the author and director eligible for some kind of special sainthood oscar for doing what writers can do, at their best: exposing, helping the innocent to know the bad guys, because the really bad guys are as charming and easy as good old Frank.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I didn't see this film for quite some time largely because it received some bad reviews from a few mainstream critics (but some deservedly great reviews from others, that, I suspect, were more honest and less worried about possible reprisals from their employers.  So much for a free press).  I decided that taking a chance on the talented and beautiful Ms. Kidman wasn't taking much of a chance at all.    Nicole Kidman was perfect for this part.  Her character is an innocent and truly good soul pathetically and obscenely exploited and denigrated by virtually all of the residents of Dogville, largely because they thought they could.  As to it being anti-American, I would say that those who watch this movie and find the town of Dogville as representative of Americans are anti-American, and any Americans that see themselves as represented by \\"Dogville\\" deserve the same fate as their representatives in Dogville, or at least deserve to be forced to watch the movie again and again.  The subject matter pertains to rotten people and just deserts everywhere, wherever the Grace's of this world may find them.     At first I thought I had rented one of those feared and dreaded \\"artsy-fartsy\\" movies that only a deluded few could appreciate, but as I persevered through the unusual set and protracted prologue and allowed the storyteller to tell his tale, I was very pleasantly surprised and rewarded.  And you will be, too.
B00005Y1UX|3.0|If ever a song came to mind that a suited a film so aptly, it would be The Beatles \\"Money Can't Buy Me Love\\". This Adrian Lyne directed/Sherry Lansing adapted freely from the John Engelhard novel vacillates from insipid melodrama to thriller to moralistic rhetoric and so on.The film starts with a silly guffaw and end with a tearful,hand-holding whimper that suggests of LOVE STORY'S Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neill stating \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\\"  The idea that comes from Englehard's novel is indeed novel:Would you be willing to, for one evening, \\"sell yourself\\" for a million dollars and be able to wipe your mind of the deed the morning after? In this case, the decision involves a couple (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore),married and very much in love, who are deeply in debt,who are offered the \\"way out\\" by agreeing mutually to have her spend one night with the rich John Gage (Robert Redford). The moral and psychological grounds that the novel and film tread are interesting ones that do cause honest pause for reflection for even the most sanctimonious of people.The questions are begged,\\"Can the money be taken,can you feel good about it, and can you go on unchanged?\\".These are all really great and compelling questions and this is the foundation upon which this film is built.The problem though is that the film never truly commits itself totally to these questions and the destructive results that follow.The film plods terribly for the first hour only to reach some measure of tension and then release with a sigh that leaves for total dissatisfaction with the entire project.  Lyne and Lansing brought to the screen FATAL ATTRACTION that nearly had everyone checking their elevators and stove-tops! This film approaches none of the drama and tension that FATAL ATTRACTION had.Still, the interesting concepts are there, but the credit for that must go to the novelist who first penned the idea.Lyne does little to nothing with it.The acting is pretty stiff and thedialogue is full of so many cliche lines that it becomes an exercise in triviality.The John Barry soundtrack is....well what can one say but...John Barry;slow,based on the same four chords in the exact same sequence that all his scores contain.One viewing will suffice with significant fast forwards through meaningless bedroom scenes .

I found out about the book from MAA. It's a college Math Mag playing with Hamming Code. Got interested in the artical about the book and then purchased it. Out of the three cyrpto books I bought this was the best. Others focused on the mathmatics and were not translated well from German.
B000TGCR38|4.0|\\"Black Book\\" (co-written by the director with Gerard Soeteman) is native Hollander Paul Verhoeven's first Dutch language film in quite a long while. There is an entire generation of moviegoers who can quote lines from \\"Basic Instinct \\", \\"Robocop \\" or \\"Starship Troopers\\" but have never heard of \\"Spetters \\", \\"The 4th Man\\" or \\"Soldier of Orange\\".    \\"Black Book\\" is a \\"Mata Hari\\" style tale set in Holland in the waning days of the German occupation, as the Allies make their post-D-Day push across Europe. Carice van Houten gives a compelling performance as a former chanteuse named Ellis, a Dutch Jew who has spent the occupation in hiding with a sympathetic farm family. When her hosts are obliterated in a bombing raid, Ellis is left with the realization that she will now have to live by her wits if she is to survive (\\"The Sound of Music\\" meets \\"Showgirls\\"? Discuss.)    After a series of harrowing escapes and misadventures, Ellis finds herself in the Dutch Resistance. As part of a plan to spring some imprisoned Resistance fighters, she is asked to seduce the commander of the local SS detachment, Colonel Muntze (Sebastian Koch, in a nicely fleshed out performance). Things get a little complicated when Ellis begins to develop a genuine attraction to Muntze.     This is a genuinely exciting war adventure, with interesting plot twists along the way (along with a few of those patented over-the-top Verhoeven moments, usually involving fearless nudity and gore). It's refreshing to see Verhoeven escaping from Hollywood and getting back to his roots;while I generally enjoy his big budget popcorn fare, I have always felt his Dutch films were much more challenging and substantive (Verhoeven the Hired Hand vs. Verhoeven the Auteur, if you will).

B00005JO5L|2.0|I'll watch anything with Al Pacino. So when Cruising came out when I was 13, I talked my parents into taking me, without any knowledge what the film was about(the TV spots were obscure, as you can imagine). About half way through the film my parents took me home, much to my relief. However, they thought there was something \\"wrong\\" with me for wanting to see the film in the first place. I tried to explain that I had no idea the film's subject matter, which was the truth. Ironically, when I came out four years later I think they actually blamed the film. Haha!    So a few years later when I was old enough to rent the film on my own, I watched it all the way through. I'm a big Exorcist fan and Pacino fan, so I thought this film would be a grand slam, but it was endlessly strange to the point of confusing, and despite some intriguing visual shocks, it was basically flat and boring. Although the film does portray homosexuals as eithef effeminate or hyper masculine leathermen, I don't find it \\"homophobic\\" anymore than I find Animal House heterophobic (Animal House doesn't exactly show the heterosexual community in the best light either). Anyone who sees this film and assumes that's how gay people act aren't worth much effort convincing anyway. The acting is below par, the script nonsensicle, the direction choppy. About the only redeeming quality of the film is the cinematography. I would reccommend this film only if you are curious how wacked out a filmaker can get. If you are looking for a good police drama, I'd suggest you save your money and watch CSI on TV.

B000002U9W|2.0|Here's the problem with \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" -- it doesn't know what it wants to be.      Is it a Ron Geesin album marketed under the Pink Floyd brand name?  Is it simply \\"Pink Floyd w/ orchestral accompaniment\\"?  Do its two lengthy instrumental suites make it a classical, or at least \\"art rock\\" album?  Or do its three intervening, unabashedly catchy, numbers move it to the \\"pop\\" end of the shelf?      There is perhaps -- given the intervening years, and fading memories -- no real way to decided the first question (the degree of Geesin's contribution).  It is likely that Geesin, who was officially charged with the role of directing the full orchestra and chorus, found his role expanding from that of arranger to composer as the sessions went on.  Apparently, the \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite\\" was somewhat difficult to record.  One such difficulty sprang from the difference in the way that classical and rock players tend to express rhythms.  A simple way of putting it is that classical players tend to stretch phrases according to the melodic demands, whereas rock players play to a steady pulse.  This wreaked havoc for portions where Nick Mason was playing along on his kit.      In all, the opening suite impresses, but impresses in individual, smallish bursts.  For instance, the solos allotted to Gilmour's slide guitar, Wright's organ, and the cello, are all wonderful moments.  However, the reliance on distorted voices, sound-effects, and moments of general cacophony tend toward flatulence.  The orchestra, in addition, is not particularly well-recorded (particularly given the year and the sort of recording equipment PF would have had at its disposal).  For all of its brassy bombast, the orchestra comes off as a bit tinny, or cramped.      The following three songs, \\"If\\", \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" and \\"Summer '68\\" are unqualified successes.  Each is written by a different band member; \\"If\\" is a typically Watersian musing on madness, death, and isolation.  \\"Fat Old Sun\\" showcases a pretty verse part from Gilmour, and his first great solo (along with stellar support from Waters's wandering, slithery bass parts).      \\"Summer 68\\" seems to be a recounting of a wild one-night stand by Rick Wright.  The mood alters between very sixties-sounding pop and darker-tinged psychedelia, until the horn part reaches its apotheosis at the end, in a coda of startling power for such an otherwise slight song.    \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is an unqualified disaster.  Pink Floyd, usually so meticulous about their released product, let a lemon get away from them here.      In sum, this stands somewhere near the middle of the Floyd discography.  It is better -- musically, at least -- than the \\"Wall,\\" and possibly even \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  It is weaker than \\"Wish\\", \\"Animals,\\" or \\"Meddle.'

1401300529|5.0|The Korean conflict is sometimes called the \\"forgotten war, with much less citizen involvement than that of WWII, considerable resentment by soldiers called up after serving in WWII - despite many others having avoided service in either, and little coverage in movies (Halberstam says \\"Mash\\" was actually a satire on Vietnam) or books. \\"The Coldest Winter\\" tells us of three disastrous American decisions (leaving South Korea out of America's \\"Asian Defense perimeter\\" - signalling a free ride to the Soviets, being woefully unprepared (insufficient, poorly led, trained and armed troops - like WWII), and bringing the Chinese into the war by getting too near their border. Much of the book then reports how individual front-line soldiers dealt with the consequences of those decisions. An estimated 2 - 3 million were killed on all sides, including 33,000 Americans.<br /><br />The \\"War\\" (officially a \\"police action\\") began with North Korean troops crossing the border with South Korea on 6/25/50 with the intent of completing the conquest within three weeks, aided by an uprising of the local farmers. Fortunately, the uprising never happened, though Mao had benefited greatly by uprisings in China's civil war. Regardless, North Korea's initial advance was assisted by MacArthur's ignoring early OSS warnings of their having moved elite troops near the 38th Parallel and removing the locals, strengthening bridges in the area, and rebuilding the rail line headed South. Two days after the initial invasion MacArthur's reaction was still strangely lackadaisical.<br /><br />Washington leaders quickly committed the U.S. - we were fearful of another Hitler, and Truman had been blamed for letting China go Communist. At almost the same time the U.S. also obtained U.N. backing (aided by Russia's boycott in protest of China being represented by the Nationalists).<br /><br />The Inchon landing turned the tide for the Allies. N.K.'s Premier Kim was MacArthur's greatest \\"asset\\" for the landing - he ignored repeated warnings by both the Chinese and Russians. After retaking Seoul, the Inchon troops, instead of cutting off the overextended N.K., turned South to disembark at Pusan, and reembark later at Wonsan, N.K. (They were beat by both Bob Hope and the original Allied troops traveling North from the Pusan area.) October 20, 1950 found the Allies in Pyongyang, and most thinking about going back home after a victory parade in Tokyo. Some, however, were not so sanguine, and worried about the eerie emptiness North of Pyongyang, the complacent status of the troops (often located in poor defensive positions), and China's threats to enter the war.<br /><br />The Joint Chiefs issued orders prohibiting entering any province bordering China, but MacArthur was riding high on the success of his Inchon landing cutting off most of the North Koreans; this great success also had been opposed by much of D.C. Thus, despite warnings from Washington, Nationalist Chinese who had been dragooned into the Chinese Army, and the OSS, MacArthur's forces advanced to the Yalu - China's border.<br /><br />The Chinese first struck on 10/25/50, with wave after wave of troops well armed and dressed for the -30 degree cold (thick, quilted reversible winter uniforms with khaki on one side and white on the other, plus thick and heavy caps with earmuffs). This was followed by a sustained and more extensive attack on 11/25. Many Americans had only light Summer issue uniforms, and lacked sleeping bags - an error all the more unforgiveable since it was a repeat of what had happened during WWII's Battle of the Bulge.<br /><br />Again, MacArthur was slow to react (partly because he was out of direct contact, never spending the night in Korea during the conflict), allowing the Chinese to inflict even greater losses. And thus began Phase III, the deadliest and longest of the Korean War.<br /><br />Allied leadership did not improve until several months later when General Walker died in an accident and was replaced by General Ridgway. Ridgway replaced numerous lower level leaders, ended MacArthur's ham-handed dominance, and quickly set higher expectations for his officers. Ridgway also quickly ended the Allies retreat, and the war stalemated.  General MacArthur, disappointed at his loss of stature, increasingly criticized Truman's policies, hoping to create a wider war with China.  Instead, he was replaced.<br /><br />Personal Notes: I spent over a year in Korea ten years later, attached to a tank battalion North of Seoul. \\"The Coldest Winter\\" contains a number of quotes from Americans critical of Korean soldiers. My own experience, though not during the war, was that they were extremely hardy and in much better battle-shape than we were.<br /><br />First-hand experience with the cold weather (and inadequate G.I. clothing), mountainous terrain, discussions with the locals, and seeing Taegu, Seoul, Inchon (the tides are enormous there), and the DMZ make \\"The Coldest Winter\\" particularly real for me. However, the biggest impression I drew from that experience was visiting Army libraries with photos and stories of the war. I will never forget the contrast between the heavy winter clothing of the Chinese and the less than adequate American uniforms - that was another unforgivable blunder by those at the top and added greatly to the suffering.<br /><br />Another unforgettable impression is that of the devastation wrought on the Korean people, a topic not addressed by Halberstam.<br /><br />Summarizing, we owe the Korean War veterans our greatest thanks and respect, and a belated thank you to Halberstam for helping bring this conflict back to life.numerous lower level leaders, ended MacArthur's ham-handed dominance, and quickly set higher expectations for his officers.

0446613444|4.0|Calexico Moore, a depressed NYPD detective who is treading on the illegal dark fringes of the drug culture he's investigating, eats both barrels of his own shotgun in a dreary motel room only days before Christmas. With Moore gone and another officer about to be placed on permanent disability leave because of alcohol abuse, the homicide unit is clearly under-staffed and overwhelmed with an outstanding case load. Lieutenant Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds, in a callous bureaucratic gesture, pleads with Harry Bosch to pull some overtime and begs him to clear just one case before New Year's - that will put the unit's clearance ratio over 50%, a marginally acceptable level in the eyes of the public and the police brass! Bosch digs in and quickly determines that not only are two of the outstanding murders related but the confusing road he must travel to solve them enters the high stakes world of designer drug smuggling and also crosses paths with the tortuous trail that led Calexico Moore to the motel room in which he took his own life.<br /><br />Most readers will agree that the Harry Bosch series is within the \\"police procedural\\" genre. But the ending twist and resolution to these complex murders rivals the endings of the finest thrillers on bookstore shelves today.<br /><br />As a character piece, \\"The Black Ice\\" firmly entrenches Harry Bosch as a very complex man to fathom with depths that are almost impossible to plumb - compassionate at times and yet outrageously brutal and callous at others; openly contemptuous of the rules of the police bureaucracy and yet rigid in the establishment of his own personal code of conduct and integrity; often shallow in his relationship with women and yet clearly longing for the depth of a meaningful relationship based in true love and compatibility; he is also an obvious \\"user\\", entirely willing to use a personal relationship for the achievement of his own short-term goals. In short, he is entirely human and not entirely likeable - but as a complex protagonist in a thrilling police procedural that you will be cheering for - well ... Connelly has simply hit the nail right on the head!<br /><br />Because of an underlying thread of multi-layer character development, references to past events and the slow but sure revelation of Bosch's history, \\"The Black Ice\\" is best served as the second entr&eacute;e in a multi-course meal which begins with the first Bosch novel, \\"The Black Echo\\", followed by \\"The Concrete Blonde\\". Ten further courses are available for your gustatory delight! Enjoy.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissin a thrilling police procedural that you will be cheering for - well ...

B000SZHECO|5.0|Over the last 45 years I have spent a large part of my life listening to music, lovin music.<br />Loving Paul McCartneys music.This His first \\"Solo Album\\" is a beautiful tribute to Linda, showing a devotional love tribute to her. It at times is almost absurdly simple, yet its truth comes through ringin loud and clear. What a gift this man has for music! Certainly Paul has made his name, music a center place for  all of us to enjoy. This is a celebration, a new found freedom straight to your ears for ever to enjoy. Enjoy! I indeed do.

1401300529|5.0|Though seventy-three at his passing last April, David Halberstam's departure came far too soon. Fortunately this American master left behind a legacy of non-fiction writing that ranks among the greatest ever achieved in this field. He took what in other hands would have been dry reporting and made of it an art form. So it is that as destiny would have it, The Coldest Winter is the last Halberstam book the world will have, and I'm glad to say the man went out with a masterpiece.<br /><br />Coming in at just over seven-hundred pages, this book tells a history of an unpopular and too often forgotten modern war that moves along more gracefully than many books a quarter its size. While Halberstam's works are long, they are never boring. Well-researched, filled with invaluable first-hand accounts, copiously referenced and end-noted, The Coldest Winter is suitable as source material for serious historians and for the rest of us as well. However, for its negative critiques of American military commanders, for its often lack of criticism of Communist leadership (Halberstam all but asserts the war was thrust upon Mao and the Chinese), and for what it leaves out---namely, in my opinion the suffering of South Korean's civilians as their nation was destroyed so it might be saved---this book is also destined to generate controversy, as well it should.<br /><br />In The Coldest Winter  (and after reading this book you will have renewed appreciation of that choice of title)  I was pleased to see a vindication of President Harry S. Truman regarding his removal of the renegade bully, General Douglas MacArthur. While there is no denying MacArthur's courage or the results of his audacious brilliance in the invasion of Inchon, the fact, boldly stated here by Halberstam, is that by the 1950's the architect of Allied victory in the Pacific in World War Two was man past his prime. In no uncertain terms Halberstam covers the god-like MacArthur's mistakes and egoism (and anti-Asian racism) as they repeatedly cost many American lives. There is a personal bitterness in Halberstam's writing when it comes to his covering the unassailably confident MacArthur's tragic push to the Yalu River, an error that still haunts the world today.<br /><br />I also cannot think of the last time a description of the horrific tragedy (and ultimate futility) of war moved me as much as did Halberstam's telling of the brave efforts of American GI's of 1950, when outnumbered and ill-lead, they fought in extreme weather conditions against a determined foe both they and their commanders had arrogantly underestimated. The section covering the heroism of these bands of hastily assembled and deployed American fighters who did their best to hold their ground against division after division of Chinese and North Korean foes, so many it looked as if the mountains themselves were moving, is Pulitzer Prize worthy in itself, and yet this book is much more. The Coldest Winter is a re-visitation of Halberstam's magnum opus, The Fifties, as he again investigates the culture, mores and attitudes of 1950's Americans toward Communism, toward the war on the Korean peninsula, and toward the role the citizens of our nation saw was theirs by right of a sort of global noblesse oblige.<br /><br />The Coldest Winter is sure to win many honors in the coming year, and to be a best seller. I am glad I pre-ordered a copy, and urge anyone with fondness for Halberstam's past books or with an interest in this \\"accidental\\" war to read it. It's not a pleasant subject, it frequently frustrated and saddened me, but it is the (final) work of a true master laboring in top form.y cost many American lives.

B00000J9HF|5.0|Once in a very rare while one runs into an operatic recording from the studio where everything works well.  That is the case with this version of Verdi's \\"Rigoletto\\".  It is certainly one of Carlo Maria Giulini's very best performances and in glorious digital sound from DGG.  From day one Giulini has been delivering some astonishing performances in all formats of the last 50 years.  There is, for instance, a very poor sounding but brilliant \\"La Traviata\\" with Tebaldi from 1953 that frankly gives a new definition to the opera that no one has yet to equal.     This recording is from 1980.  Placido Domingo is the Duke of Mantua, Pierro Cappuccilli the title character, Ileana Cortrubas a perfect Gilda, Nicolai Ghiarov is a big step up for Sparafucile and the Magdelena of Elena Obraztsova is beyond anyone's expectation.  I guess the most inspired bit of casting comes in the guise of Kurt Moll as Monterone.  Talk about a roaring curse put on the humpback!  Add to this the glistening performance of the Wiener Staatsopernchor and the Vienna Philharmonic plus Giulini's innate sense of operatic drama and what a blend one gets!  Giulini, fastidious as always, is able to take tempi that would normally be played more rapidly and slow them down to wring every drop of emotion from them.  And none of this is done to grand stand.  In fact by the time Gilda has been kidnapped I found myself hearing this opera sort of on a \\"first time\\" basis.  I've certainly never encountered anything like it before.      I heard Domingo and Cortrubas sing their pairing at the Met in 1977.  I still think this is Domingo's greatest role when everything is taken into consideration.  Handsome, just the right size voice, and perfect sense of style and a thousand other plaudits describe the man at his operatic finest.  Elena Cortrubas is similarly cast and I simply can't think of another Gilda that is both so child-like and yet can sing the many big moments in her part without shrieking or disappearing under the orchestra. This recording is as I remembered her in the house 30 years ago.  Cappuccilli is in a league of his own as Rigoletto.  I've only heard this baritone in person once, and he is the only singer I've ever seen in New York that got a truly well deserved encore for his big aria in Rossini's \\"William Tell\\".  He has a rather four square sound that's perfect for Verdi.  It is neither blustery nor overly refined, (something I hate in this part).  He makes the case for a fool as a fool and lets out waves of sound without covering his high notes to their detriment.  Ghiarov and Obraztsova are, well, simply beyond anything one can expect ever to hear on the stage.  Siepi probably recorded Sparafucile more than any other great bass, and for my money that silky Italian voice owns the role.  But Ghiarov is understated and majestic at the same time.  Obraztsova's heavily tinged Italian does no harm here as she is able to bring the right balance to her ensemble work.  Moll is out of this world as he yells \\"sii maledetto\\" to the shocked Rigoletto.  Along with Giulini you simply can't find a better ensemble that is so utterly successful at their task.  Don't miss it!
B000UFAURI|5.0|While I don't think any album can close to the genius that are The Colour and The Shape and There is Nothing Left to Lose, EPSC comes close. I agree with others that this album is what In Your Honor should have been. You can tell that the album flows better, has a good mix of songs and is reminiscent of the Foo's earlier work. But, Honestly evokes the same built up tension that New Way Home does. The riff at the end of Honestly is just awesome. Let it Die, The Pretender, Cheer Up Boys, Long Road to Ruin, and Stranger Things are other favorites. While I love a ton of the songs off the last two albums (All My Life is the best rocker of all), this ALBUM captures a lot of what turned me on to the Foos in the first place.

B000TUXL2A|1.0|We waited several years for this drivel?  Why can't one of the best guitar players in the world create a album that features the guitar music instead of the insipid lyrics?  I'm sorry I bought it - a waste of money.
B000UFAURI|5.0|This is the best complete album experience the Foo Fighters have created. Every song is either very good or great, and this album is dynamic, with tunes ranging from acoustic to hard rock (and there are several songs that start acoustic and then morph into head-banging arena anthems!) There's even an acoustic finger-pickin' instrumental reminiscent of Zeppelin (and it's fantastic!). This is my favorite Foo cd followed by \\"Nothing Left To Lose\\" and \\"Color and The Shape\\" (although every Foo Fighters album rocks!) This is one of those cds where you never push the skip button. Enuff said.

I'm going to be buying the dvd for the holidays: I'm waiting to see if they release the second season this december or wait a bit in which case I'll just get the first.<br /><br />There are a lot of longer posts and summaries about this show so I'll just write why I love it: the actors, the writing, and the premise. This show gells together and hangs on in a way that Lost hasn't and Heroes does. It's got excellent production values and the futuristic look blends with the hear and now.<br /><br />I love it. Tuesdays at 9 on SciFi for new episodes. Be there, you won't be disappointed.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|A far cry from the book, written by Robert Ludlum, but an excellent movie. Extremely well made. The way the second movie flows into Bourne Ultimatum is really pleasing. Matt Damon has definitely re-vitalized the spy movie genre.<br />Excellent all round.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Lazarus Redd (Samuel Jackson) is left by his wife, Rose, after she states that living with him didn't allow her to live her own life.  Laz is left bitter and alone, with nothing to fill him except his love of playing the blues.<br /><br />Rae Doole, (Christina Ricci) has a $exual addiction disorder.  When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves to join the military, Rae gets one of her \\"attacks\\" and goes on the prowl.  One of Ronnie's friends gets his hands on her and beats the cr@p out of her, leaving Rae on the side of the road out near Laz's house.  When Laz finds her the next morning, he takes her inside and steels himself to cure her of her demons while he fights his own.<br /><br />There's some controversy over kidnapping, what with Laz chaining Rae to keep her from running off again, but somehow the movie works itself out and away from any evil involved in the action.<br /><br />Can Rae change her ways?  Can Ronnie overcome his anxiety issues?  Can Laz exorcise his own demons?  The plot comes out as the weaker point in this film, giving way to stellar performances by Christina Ricci and Samuel Jackson.  Even Justin Timberlake does a decent job.  Jackson and Ricci do their own singing in the film, without dubbing in other voices.  The film has a real, southern feel to it.<br /><br />Overall, the film didn't live up to the hype I'd heard about it, but was still a good enough film to watch.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!
B000050XEI|3.0|Enya has an average voice.  If I had that much electronic \\"stuff\\" happening around me, I could sound whispy and angelic too.  But it's an over-produced gimic designed to prey upon the unthinking fan base of the original Enya recordings.  In the past decade or so, she has virtually been entirely predictible, and is now boring.<br /><br />I would challenge the producer to look into something new in order to avoid overuse of the style that has made this artist famous.  But to do that would be to ensure career suicide.  Put her alone without the synthetic sound, and the voice will put you to sleep... not in the good way.  I'm bored!
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I've followed Knopfler's career for over 30 years now.  This latest album is a sure sign of something most of us are experiencing, maturity.  As with each of his solo albums, Kill To Get Crimson shows a new side to his ever evolving character.    I've played the digital bits off of every Straits CD, and even more so with his solo albums.  His new work may not always have the blinding guitar speed that the older tunes had, but the quality is every bit as good.  Listen to the beautiful mix of instruments on this latest album, its every bit as lyrical as anything done in the past.  His taste and style may be maturing, but if you doubt his ability to still play smoking guitar just catch one of his tours.  He can still smoke through the solos in Telegraph Road and Sultans, even if his feet aren't as nimble.  Who's are, we are all getting older.
B000UFAURI|5.0|I have been a fan of the Foo Fighters since I first heard the \\"I'll Stick Around\\" single Dave Grohl and crew released back in 1995. I was eleven years old in 1995, and the Foo Fighters have been my favorite band ever since. I have bought each Foo Fighters album on the day it was released, and today I picked up ESPG. I am now 23. Nothing has changed: The Foo Fighters still got it.    Pretender opens the album and you can't help but notice your foot tapping and your head banging. As some previous reviewers have said, this album both hearkens back to Colour and the Shape in some songs, and melds acoustic \\"In You Honor-ish\\" in a way that blows me away. In that same spirit Stranger Things Have Happened is what acoustic Foo Fighters is all about. The Ballard of the Beaconsfield Miners is an awesome treat and Home is like a lullaby that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up while at the same time forceing you to try and sing along.     I was a fan at eleven years old. I AM A FAN NOW!!!!! Buy this album if you have or haven't bought one before. You will not regret it, you'll be blown away.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|People who say all their albums are the same don't know what they're talking about and/or aren't paying attention.  The Murphys have been my favorite band ever since their first album and I didn't start to feel disappointed until The Warriors Code because they started to sound like they were repeating a formula.  That's why I like that they've taken a new direction on this one, or rather a return to the more straightforward late-70's Oi punk of The Gang's All Here.  And people who jumped on board with The Warrior's Code after The Departed and Shipping Up To Boston got big who say it's just like that album are wrong because they're new to the game and don't know the difference (don't get me wrong, I'm glad you're here now and god bless you).  I like this a lot and I'm sure it'll grow on me more after time the same way that Gang's All Here did.
B00005JPWF|5.0|Into the Wild is an incredibly touching film that portrays the limitless beauty and power of forgiveness.  Despite the flaws of those around him Chris realizes in the very end that \\"Happiness is only reall when shared.\\"  Thanks to the superb performances by Emile Hirsch and his costars Sean Penn has masterfully portrayed a universal story that will surely melt many years of bitter resentment in more than a few hearts.  Some of us who also possess the same burning compulsion as Chris to undertake the hero's journey will be particularly inspired by the movie.  I myself was deeply moved to tears and filled with a fuller sense of compassion towards all.  I appreciated how Chris's intense inner turmoil and search for himself was explored as in the Southern California Bar scene.  The road weary, homeless, vagabound Chris finds himself transfixed as he stands watching the carefree revelers in the sidewalk cafes.  Then he pictures his own face among theirs winking at him with a cavalier smile but he turns away knowing that this tantalizing dream cannot be reached until he not only meets head on the untamed wild but also climbs the cold mountian within his heart. I can honestly see that this is my favorite movie of all time.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Surprisingly, this is the best album they have released since Transnational. I thought Clutch was falling after I listened to Pure Rock Fury but every release since then has stepped it up a notch from the previous release.

B000TUXL2A|4.0|There is not much more that can be said only to build on a previous comment which was It's Knopfler! And thats why I had to write this review, are you going to get those great solos like Sultans? No! but, there is more to music than just long guitar solos. I must be getting old.  I actually think out of all of his solo albums, which I have, this is actually the easiest one to listen to right through. There really isn't a bad song on this album. The opening track is very much like you would expect from his solo albums, Punish The Monkey which is my favourite is the Dire Straits sounding song, which he has generally had one on each album, so he has stuck to that formula quite well. The quirky lyrics are still there, just listen to Secondary Waltz for that. Behind With The Rent is another highlight in my opinion. I guess if you are after another Dire Straits album then Sailing To Philadelphia is the one you should get. But if you want to hear one of the most underated songwriters around today then you will want this album.

075640407X|3.0|Have to admit, the cover (with the Green Man) drew me to read this.  (What a Green Man has to do with the story is a question, but then, the cover did its job.)  The book is easy to read, and the start is highly entertaining, yet I preferred the third-person narration to Kvothe's own telling. Kvothe isn't really very likeable, from inside his own head.  And my goodness me, in 600 pages, it would be nice to have a semblance of a plot.  That's where the \\"self-indulgent\\" stems from.  Disgressions and philosophy are all very well, but really, our protagonist Kvothe thinks highly of himself and Mr. Rothfuss' opinions, and he does go on and on and on...    Imagine my disappointment in discovering that this doorstop of a book was but the start of another tedious trilogy.  (Publishers - get over it. Rattling good stories used to be told in one book.) Life is too short to wade through a book this long, only to discover: 1) not much story, and 2) what story there is must be discovered in subsequent books.    Rothfuss is very good with emotions, and that helped me keep reading, as did his hints (but little more than hints) at world.  The magic is excellent, creative and believable.  However, Mr. Rothfuss and his editor need to pay attention to standard English grammar.  The verb to lie (not the one meaning to prevaricate, the one meaning to set down or stretch out) is misused every single time!  It's maddening -- and not the only error.      Fun, but on the whole, no thanks.
0743486285|5.0|This book is extremly eye opening. As a former addict myself it paints a picture of addiction that people don't usually get to see.

B000JKA0B0|5.0|I recently got the Limited Edition Völkerball for my 21st birthday a few days ago and I absolutely love it. The photo tour book is put together so well and the pictures are amazing..very artistic and real. I haven't watched the live concerts yet, but I have watched \\"The making of Reise, Reise\\" (which by the way, Paul filmed the entire thing himself) and \\"Anakonda im Netz\\", both of which are spectacular. Any Rammstein fan, new or old, would love to own Völkerball. I personally think, aside from albums, it's the best product Rammstein has released. The only thing that I think could have made it perfect..is if they either had a DVD with all their video's to date or some kind of Lichtspielhaus part 2 with the video's from Reise, Reise and Rosenrot..but it's not a big deal. Anyhow, any price you may pay is well worth it since it's 2 DVD's, 2 full length CD's and a 190 page photo tour book. Well worth every penny.    Thanks to anyone involved in the making of Völkerball! It's truely a great piece of Rammstein history to own.
B000PY52EU|5.0|I knew I had to see this movie when I first saw the advertising art cruising past me on the side of a Los Angeles Transit Bus.  A sweaty Samuel L. Jackson clutching a thick chain, while a near-naked Christina Ricci crawled on the floor.  \\"Yup\\", I said to myself,  \\"this looks unusual\\".  I know this isn't a feminist-correct thing to say, but I swore right then and there to pay my $6 just to endorse the ad art.  Since that time, I have acquired the DVD, and I still think that \\"Black Snake Moan\\" is a most unusual picture.    This is not a movie for the faint-hearted in many ways.  Ricci's character, Rae, is a truly degraded soul - she can't drink enough or have enough sex to make her pain go away.  It's not presented as theory, either - you have to watch this young woman doing some pretty rank stuff.  I personally wanted to take some strong action to sober her up and straighten her out.  Thankfully, Jackson's character, Lazarus, took care of this for me -- \\"I aim to heal you of your wickedness,\\" he says to her, and that's a good thing.    Most of the action in this movie takes place in a pretty limited physical space - Lazarus' cabin.  It realy does seem in some ways as though it could have been a stage play - maybe that's why so many people have remarked that it has a Tenneessee Williams feel to it.  I kind of wish it had been written as a stage play - I would have been interested to see what interpretations a variety of actors would have brought to these roles.       The other reviews on this site will pretty much explain the rest of the picture.  Some people apparently feel that the ending is unbelievable -- a bit too pat and happy.  Me, I liked it -- heck, the entire film is unbelievable.  Why complain about the happy ending?  The blues music was wonderful -- there's a sequence where Lazarus is playing his guitar while a lightning storm goes on outside his cabin and Raew sits on the floor, clutching his leg.  Wow, that was a fine sequence.    One reviewer here remarked on the \\"unrealistic\\" fact that Ricci's underwear/costume stayed white throughout and did not get all grimey.  Personally, I appreciated that.  I don't think that costuming choice on the director's part was pornographic - it was more like a courtesy to the viewers.  There's enough grime and sweat in this picture, why add to it?  Maybe the perpetually white underwear was symbolic of her basically pure soul.  Or maybe not.       Great ad art, great music, clean underwear, lots of sweat and a happy ending.  That's about it.  Except that this is a film for grown-ups.

B0000TB050|5.0|I am a huge U2 fan... I still honestly believe that this is the most enjoyable DVD to watch. After my first viewing I bought five copies as gifts for other U2 fans in my life. You can feel that Bono, Edge, Larry and Adam are at home... the humor at certain points is worth seeing alone. Especially when the hat lands on Edge's head and stays for a split second. They keep playing as if it were scripted! I would recommend this DVD(at least to watch once) to any fan of music in general.
8888493190|3.0|As expected, this highlights some of the more refined and detailed works from one of my favorite artists.    PRO: Lots of images, one on each page.  This is why you buy the book.  CON: My copy feels like it was printed on near-newsprint paper that was cut with a dull scissors around the edges.  Fingerprints show up on the porous cover indefinitely.  Some of the work was created in black and white, but is in the book against a field of unattractive blue (basic cyan?), and the registration is a little off as well.  Ink seems to have transfered a bit to blank facing pages, creating even more of a newsprint feel.    This is certainly not a triumph of book design or physical quality, but I would still buy it, as I love Mike Giant's work and can now study his lines and motifs for hours.

Some observations:  - The songs have become more complex, the production more sophisticated (reminds me a bit of C.O.C.'s In the Arms of God). The album features few potential hit singles (Down I had lots of those, remember the video to \\"Stone the Crow\\"? Down II had for example \\"Ghosts along the Mississippi\\").   - Phil screams less, sings cleanly most of the time, sings background to his own lead voice a lot.  - Kill me if you like, but I some passages remind me of Alice in Chains! Maybe a more mature touch? I guess \\"less outright aggression but still the same intensity\\" describes what I mean.  - Very often, a simply melody is repeated endlessly, like an incantation. They already did that on Down I, but here it's almost in every song. The first couple of times I listened to the album I thought this way of composing wasn't really dynamic enough, but now I can't help but nod my head during every one of those passages.    In a nutshell: the album is less \\"user-friendly\\" but not less brilliant than its predecessors. It's a new dimension to Down. It takes a couple of spins to get into the new way of nodding but once you're there you know once more that Down is one of the greatest outfits of misfits out there!
0060922583|5.0|I read this book a few months ago and it left a very strong impression upon me. It is amazing that this book was written 15 years ago, with science that is at least 20 years old if not older. The most amazing thing is that the paradigm that the author is talking about through out this book is still far from becoming part of our culture and society. It is a shame that we with our western minds and egocentric thinking have neglected to tolerate or even accept a holographic model which is adopted as a common fact from more mature cultures than our own.  I believe that this book is necessary reading as we are in the early part of the 21st century. The great thing about this book is that it begins to force our culture on a whole to begin to shed away out newtonian mechanistic model that we apply to every discipline for a more dynamic and whole approach that appreciates the causes and effects that are possible on different planes of reality in which we only participate in  a small part with our normal daily waking consciousness.   Another great part of this book is that it gives the western man/woman a glimpse of a reality far more real than our own and dictates that we can only evolve by our level of compassion, knowledge and service which is the great teaching distilled from all the Great Holy Masters. A must read.
B000002UAC|5.0|The Beatles album With The Beatles still sells strong and there's no doubt why: this music is ageless and timeless. The Beatles never sounded better; and we get a generous fourteen tracks from them on this album.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"It Won't Be Long.\\" This song really rocks and the band makes this number take off like a jet with guitars, great singing, drums and percussion! \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" a ballad about a woman returning back to her man, provides a strong start for this album. \\"All My Loving\\" is instantly recognizable; this rock ballad shines like gold as The Beatles perform a number about how they'll miss their sweethearts while they must be away. \\"All My Loving\\" sports some great harmonizing; and the subtle tempo changes make the number even better!<br /><br />\\"Till There Was You\\" is a stunningly beautiful number about how a man is so much happier now that he has found his one true love. \\"Till There Was You\\" has a great guitar arrangement; and Paul sings this with great sensitivity. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" gets the royal treatment from the band as they deliver this cover with an awesome amount of energy--and some great guitar work, too. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" sports some great harmonizing on backup, too.<br /><br />\\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" a song by Chuck Berry covered here by The Beatles; gets a whopping beat with just the right tempo to keep this peppy, upbeat number perfect. Listen for some great harmonizing; and the drums enhance \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" too.<br /><br />The album ends strong with \\"Money (That's What I Want).\\" More harmonizing and guitar make this number the best! Just about anyone can identify with this number about people wanting more money to have a better lifestyle. Awesome!<br /><br />The liner notes have great black and white photos of the band and we get the song credits, too. Tony Barrow writes a good essay as well.<br /><br />The Beatles can never be forgotten; their music remains a permanent fixture in the realm of entertainment. Theirs was a true rock and roll that also revolutionized 1960s rock and roll. We are all much better off for The Beatles sharing their artistry with us; and their music will surely be available to people everywhere for a very, very long time to come.also revolutionized 1960s rock and roll.

B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles never did anything half baked; and this awesome album is certainly no exception. Beatles For Sale gives us fourteen excellent tunes by The Beatles and this is a must-have for any rock and roll fan.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"No Reply.\\" They sing of a woman who avoids them after she decides that she no longer loves them. The harmony works well with the guitars, drums and percussion carrying the bulk of the melody. The Beatles never sounded better; and the tempo changes make \\"No Reply\\" even better.<br /><br />\\"Baby's In Black\\" gives us more classic rock from The Beatles; love that guitar! The key changes and subtle tempo changes make \\"Baby's In Black\\" a great song.\\"Rock & Roll Music\\" really rocks, as you might suspect. John sings this flawlessly; and his youthful energy enhances the quality of \\"Rock & Roll Music.\\" The guitars carry the melody and this works well. \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" changes gears rapidly as The Beatles now sing a more mellow, pensive ballad about how people move on after a love affair ends. They sing without a superfluous note to make \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" a strong number. Great!<br /><br />\\"Eight Days A Week\\" gives us classic 1960s rock from the best of the best. They harmonize well and the hand clapping adds a nice touch. Love it! They sing of how much they love their girlfriends--so much so, in fact, that they love their girlfriends eight days a week instead of seven! SMILE \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" features The Beatles mixing a country beat with a rock and roll flavor to add beauty to this ballad. The guitars are excellent and I love that percussion!<br /><br />\\"Everyone's Trying To Be My Baby\\" gets the royal treatment by The Beatles as they do an excellent cover of this tune. The guitars and percussion make a great beat and the guitar jamming in the middle of the song really rocks!<br /><br />The liner notes have great artwork and photos of the band; we get the song credits, too. Derek Taylor contributes a fine essay about The Beatles and this album.<br /><br />As usual, The Beatles scored a major coup with yet another fantastic album. The Beatles played so well that their music will never go \\"out of style;\\" their music will be available to the masses for many ages to come.As usual, The Beatles scored a major coup with yet another fantastic album.

B000UR366S|4.0|(4 & 1/2 stars) Joni Mitchell's latest CD is a most welcome return, and worth the wait.  This was obviously a very personal work, as she not only wrote and sang the tunes, she also played the majority of the instruments and co-produced!  (Two notable exceptions to the one-woman show are Bob Sheppard's adept sax lines and some sweet pedal steel by Greg Leisz.)  The songs are classic Joni, sometimes swinging, other times brilliantly introspective, always thought-provoking.  Some will almost certainly be added to my list of Joni Mitchell favorites, particularly the marvelous \\"Bad Dreams.\\"  Lyrically, her poetic insights are most timely, with comments on our destruction of the planet, the blindness of elected officials, the climate of hatred and tension which pervades, but also some much more intimate observations.  To echo what others have said, as striking as this album has been the first couple of times through, I think it's something I will grow to appreciate even more in the coming years.

0596007124|5.0|I flipped through this book to get a feel for how it will differ from other design patterns works.  I immediately realized that the authors are taking a very accessible approach to teaching readers about patterns.<br /><br />On an individual basis, the text is very accessible.  It is written in an easy-to-read style.  Instead of avoiding technical jargon, the text improves understanding and retention by coupling technical terms with humorous anecdotes and quips.  This approach gives the feeling that design patterns are within reach (and they are) of even readers new to the concepts.  It also serves as a built-in mnemonic tool.<br /><br />The structure of pattern delivery seems to be intentional as well.  In the rare case where a pattern is referenced without yet being described, it is almost always in the context of how the current pattern will prove useful in other scenarios.  As such, the reader never feels lost.  In fact, quite the opposite affect occurs.  Readers should feel like they are following a logical approach to learning patterns.<br /><br />Although it may seem, from the above comments, that the book is elementary, I assure you that even seasoned developers will find the book useful.  Even if you know the material extremely well, you may find that the authors' descriptions are useful when teaching junior developers on your teams.<br /><br />The book layout, like the rest of the book, is broad-reaching.  Obviously, it is an instructional work.  More than that, however, the book is also a teaching tool.  It can easily be adapted by educators and trainers for classroom-style and one-on-one teaching.  The book also serves as a workbook.  There are exercises and notes pages throughout each chapter.  Finally, the book serves me as a reference work as well.  If I remember the gist of a pattern but not the specifics, it is easy to find examples and canonical references.<br /><br />I absolutely love this style.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn patterns, refresh their existing patterns knowledge, or just take in a proverbial \\"breath of fresh air\\" to the stiff writing style of other books covering complex topics.  I also feel that any of the \\"Head First\\" books are worth consideration.  They provide accessible formats that promote learning.<br /><br />I have to close this review by concurring with the authors in their note to the \\"Gang of Four\\".

B000UFAURI|4.0|Perhaps we've all accepted the cold, hard fact that the Foo Fighters' best days are behind them. Afterall, their last two albums -- 2005's \\"In Your Honor\\" and 2002's \\"One By One\\" -- were a bit lopsided, unimaginitive and appeared to be incomplete. Despite the fact that they haven't completely lost their knack for making great music, as those albums contain some real nuggets, it has become apparent that they may never recapture the magic of the beloved sophmore album, \\"The Colour And The Shape,\\" or even 1999's slightly underrated \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose.\\" Maybe Dave Grohl and company have come to realize this as well, and that's why they reteamed with Gil Norton (who produced \\"The Colour And The Shape\\") and have crafted their broadest and most \\"classic\\" album since the turn of the century: \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.\\"<br /><br />Opening with \\"The Pretender,\\" which is possibly their most instantly gratifying single since \\"Monkey Wrench,\\" Foo Fighters get this album off to a rocking start, engaging the listener and getting them primed for what is perhaps the most experimental of their material. One can't help but notice the classic rock influence on the album, and it's quite obvious that while making the album, they wanted something that will live on past it's time. An album that future generations can discover and relate to. On that end, they succeed. Thankfully, the band pries it's sound wide open enough that portions of the album, such as \\"Stranger Things Have Happened,\\" \\"Statues\\" and \\"Home,\\" fall under the Foo umbrella, yet sound unlike anything the band has done before, making this perhaps the farthest reaching album of their career, appealing to fans both young and old. It's unfortunate, then, that the band can't help but slip into autopilot as they sometimes do, and in turn, songs like \\"Erase/Replace\\" and -- gotta love this song title -- \\"Cheer Up Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\\" are just standard b-side tunes that don't do much to help the album. But for the most part, the album is a smashing success. It retains the core Foo sound while broadening it's range and crafting some timeless tunes. For sure, this is the album that \\"In Your Honor\\" could have been, had they not chosen to seperate the two different styles on two different discs.<br /><br />While not being quite the perfect album or the massive creative comeback, it's definitely the best thing they have done in a good long while. Those expecting the arena-rock of Foo Fighters' past might be disappointed to find a more mature sound, but anyone willing to give it a few solid spins will see it's brilliance.the most part, the album is a smashing success.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|To say \\"Grindhouse\\" was perhaps the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time would be a gross understatement. The genius of Robert Rodriguez's \\"Planet Terror\\" and Quentin Tarantino's \\"Death Proof\\" combined was matched only by the disappointment of a movie-going public virtually ignoring such a rich and colorful experience. Would you rather text message or crinkle your candy wrappers through a single, overpriced movie, which will likely be a remake or a sequel as opposed to being treated to two fun, campy, quality films for the price of one? What could have, should have been a film history milestone went by generally unnoticed, and we can probably place half the blame of seperating these movies into two full-priced DVD's on that fact alone.<br /><br />But I digress. It's hard not to let the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the \\"Grindhouse\\" experience at home damper your mood, but in reality, \\"Death Proof\\" was an excellent movie all in itself, so it merits it's own release. For Quentin Tarantino's sixth full-length film, we are treated to a John Carpenter-esque stalker/slasher movie that, oddly enough, features a man behind a wheel doing all the damage. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike. Mike has a rather fancy, souped-up Chevy Nova that has been outfitted so extensively that he can survive any car crash. Trick is, as one poor lady finds out mid-way through the movie, you have to be in the passenger seat to take advantage of it's benefits. Mike goes through the first half of the film taking pleasure in high-speed action worthy of a major motion picture action (hmmm...) that doesn't fare too well for the people on the other end. It's not until he comes across a group of tough as nails, but rather chatty ladies that he meets his match and the killer becomes the victim. \\"Death Proof\\" works like a strange blend of the original \\"Gone In Sixty Seconds\\" and \\"Halloween.\\" It succeeds because it's a new take on old material and actually builds characters that are real and relateable.<br /><br />A blurb on the back of the DVD case totes this as Tarantino's most original film since \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" That statement is not too far off. Whereas \\"Jackie Brown\\" and both volumes of \\"Kill Bill\\" also paid homage to movies of past, \\"Death Proof\\" stands out because it has an unmistakeable Tarantino vibe to it, and what is usually typical, predictable material is turned on it's head and spun in only the way Quentin can. It's got great characterization, realistic dialogue, intense action scenes and one satisfying ending. Even if the DVD features leave a bit to be desired -- you can smell the double-dip coming next year -- it's still worth buying the \\"Grindhouse\\" features seperately, as \\"Death Proof\\" is presented in an extended fashion here, with material that helps the film stand by itself even better. Pretty much a perfect movie that I would recommend to anyone who loves Quentin Tarantino, cars and slasher flicks.d relateable.

B000LPS3B2|5.0|I was watching this last night and i couldn't help but be impressed how it kept me interested in the movie while also freakin scaring me at the same time.  The movie has a lot of suspense to it as well as violence.  But it never really goes overboard nor does it detract from the movie at hand. The movie revolves around Tun and his girlfriend June.  They are returning from a night of hanging out with friends, drinking and driving yeah that was a nice brain fart.  Senses impaired they hit and a girl walking in the street.  They (Tun) decides to just leave the victim lying in the street (it being an accident and all).  So they drive off like nothing has happened.<br /><br />It never works out that way though does it?  The girl that they hit and left for dead has a special connection to Tun that gets explained in vivid detail later on in the movie..suffice to say its very interesting.  Also pay attention when he starts complaining about \\"his neck hurting\\" and watch for it later on.  Its an excellent movie and i have bought movies from Tartan Asia Extreme in the past \\"Two Sisters\\" which was also pretty good.  But just to close this \\"Shutter\\" brings a little something extra to the horror genre without all the blood/violence (not that i mind that).  Its good to see a movie focus on other aspects (suspense)...great movie and great purchase to add your DVD collection as well.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I cannot give a poignant review that would do justice to *Children of Men*, like K. Harris and other top reviewers here.  Just read theirs, they've said everything beautiful about this film.<br /><br />All I can say is that this film enchanted me from the beginning to the end.  I love films that cause me to think after the movie is over.  But this one caused me to think about it days after I saw it.<br /><br />Clive Owens plays Theo Faron, living in England...in 2027.  People around the world has stopped being able to reproduce children.  The youngest human was 18 but was murdered for refusing to do something.<br /><br />Immediately after this murder, Theo's estranged wife appears and pleads him to help her sneak in Kee, an African-American refugee to the \\"other side\\".  However, she must have travel permits/papers.  After a round of adventure that resulted in a death, Theo discovers that Kee is actually pregnant.  The first such pregnancy in almost 20 years.  Theo suddenly understands why Kee must go to the other side...into the safety of the Human Project, whose aim is to cure infertility.<br /><br />All I can say is that *Children of Men* presented such an issue that is worth intellectual discussion.  For many, the possibility of a world-wide infertility is impossible.  However, if it should ever happen, how would the world react?  And if a woman was to get pregnant, would she be used as a political weapon or as a medical guinea pig?  And are you willing to die to ensure the birth of a miracle?<br /><br />I cannot decide which scenes were my favorites.  I liked the abduction of Theo.  I liked the escape from the Fishes.  I liked the war scenes between the army and the militia.  Heck, I liked everything.  This is truly one that you should have added to your DVD collection.
B000UFAURI|4.0|This isn't a perfect album, or even the best Foo Fighters album in my opinion, but it is a damn good rock album.  The Foo Fighters usually change things up from album to album.  Some people like the balls out rock, while others like them when they lean toward pop, and still others like the acoustic Foos.  This album has a little of everything.  So if you like Dave screaming his voice out, then there is a song or two for you.  A number of really catchy songs, I really enjoyed the album all the way through.  The only exception was the last track \\"Home\\", which is just Dave and a piano.  That one kind of dragged for me.  Other than that, terrific classic rock album. One quick note is that if you buy the album from iTunes you will get a bonus track \\"Once & for All\\".
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Earlier in the summer, I thought *Transformers* was fast and filled to the brim with action.  I spoke too soon.  *Bourne Ultimatum* is packed to the seams with action and fast.  You have to pay attention the entire time.  You have to put up with the untraditional and \\"jerky\\" camera shots.  Regardless, this was one of the best spy films that I've seen in my life!<br /><br />Jason Bourne is back and is still trying to find out what happened to him.  People are in and out of his life and he's not sure if they're on his side or not.  The term, \\"Project Blackbriar\\", is mentioned and is red-flagged, calling the attention of intelligence agencies.  So, everyone is out to capture Jason.  Meanwhile, Jason tries to save a reporter, an operative and of course, himself.  At the same time, someone inside an agency is trying to communicate and save Jason.  The question is, who?  And will Jason recognize the signal for communication?<br /><br />I really do not want to spill much about this movie.  All I can say is just go and watch this.  This third part of the Bourne trilogy is a long movie but the kind that you can tolerate.  Which means, don't drink alot.  I will hold my bladder threatening to burst until the movie is over.  However, this one was so long that I just could not hold it and had to go.  Of course, I had to go and miss the most important part.  Now, I gotta get this movie and watch it again!  But, this movie is so worth watching again!
B000UR366S|4.0|Initially I said I wasn't going to review this album right away.  I said that Joni's albums have to live with you for awhile before you really get them.  I will stand by that statement.  However, on the other hand it's not every day you can write a piece about your initial reactions to a Joni Mitchell album.  Since I'm given this rare opportunity, I'm going to steal the moment.<br /><br />Usually when new albums come out I go to my 24 hour WalMart late late Monday night and get it off of the truck right out of the box.  For the new Joni album, I wanted to wake up on a sunny morning, go out to lunch with my friend, and buy the album in the daylight.  Since Starbucks was the catalyst for the new album, I wanted to buy the album right from the source.  There is a 24 hour Starbucks in Tampa that may have sold me the album last night.  From what I've read about SHINE before listening to it, this is an album about awakenings and a search for brightness in a dim time.  So I stood by my choice to have the first time I heard these songs be with the sun shining on me.<br /><br />My second initial plan was to keep the album wrapped and bring it home with me.  Open it up in my fabulous bedroom and lay on my bed, read along with the lyrics, and listen.  Upon awakening, I realized that I wanted to experience this album out in the world.  Moving.  In motion.  In my car.  So I ate lunch with my friend, the first Starbucks had no copies of the album (maybe the sold out!) but on the second try, I walked in and saw a bin full of...the new Joni Mitchell album!<br /><br />I got to my car and went to a deserted parking lot.  I love tearing the cellophane off of a CD and seeing what's inside.  Initially, I love the cover for this album.  Although I do enjoy thematic cohesiveness within a discography, at times a repetitive pattern can get stale.  I am glad Joni choose to try something different than the \\"picture in a frame\\" presentation she's used quite often for the last 13 years for her cover art.<br /><br />My first impression of the album was that there was no photo of Joni to be found.  I found this to be telling and symbolic without even hearing the music.  At times I've found Joni to be (albeit very lovingly!!!!) egotistical, and it says something about her evolution as a writer and artist that she's chosen to represent these songs visually with some haunting pictures drawn from the ballet inspired by her music.<br /><br />I put the CD in my car stereo and let her rip.  When I really thought about it...I realized how neat it was Joni opened this album with an instrumental.  This is a first in the Joni discography, and the piece is gorgeous.  This song was reportedly the song that reignited Joni's musical muse.  You can hear the magic in the piano playing.  Sometimes throughout the more recent years I've found Joni's piano playing to be a bit stale...she often employed the same similar rolling pattern with her left hand...(for musical geeks the 1st, 6th, 1st).  What a pleasure to hear in this first instrumental, her most inventive and varied piano playing since at least Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.<br /><br />When Joni's voice came in on the second cut I was moved to tears.  It was good to hear the voice again.  Singing her own words.  I wonder what that voice had to teach me this time.  I wonder what thoughts this album would leave me with?<br /><br />And song after song unfolded.  By the fourth cut, the inventive \\"Hana\\" Joni was entering new territory and pushing her sound like she hadn't in years.  It bought a big smile to my face.  In fact, throughout this album you will hear Joni playing her guitar and piano in ways we have no heard her play it on any previous release.  Isn't that wonderful, considering this is her 16th album of original songwriting?  Many times on this album I was reminded of \\"Paprika Plains\\" from DON JUAN'S RECKLESS DAUGHTER.  I do wonder if Joni drew inspiration from that track when it was revisited and remixed for a compilation last year.  Many of Joni's piano pieces on this album have a similar classical feel.<br /><br />The new version of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" was an immediate winner in my book.  The acoustic guitar shuffle was unlike anything we've heard from Joni, and it's not often a singer can reinvent one of their own songs this successfully.  Cyndi Lauper failed with her acoustic re-castings of her old catalog.  Mitchell herself tried to reinvent her back catalog with orchestral versions.  That project was hit and miss at best.  This time around, \\"Big Yellow Taxi 2007\\" has the eagerness and freshness of a brand new cut.  And the accordion  stabs were intentionally funny and refreshing on a such a ponderous album.<br /><br />When initially reading this album I worried that it would be preachy.  But listening to it, it is not.  This album only stands as authentication that when Joni wrote her environmentally conscious music in the early 1970s, she really believed in what she was writing.  Her love for mother earth is unfailing and constant.  Through the years many of us (including myself) have fallen victim to the numbing society...the allure of living in the moment...the endless search for instant pleasures.  This album is a dark blue wake up call to start thinking, challenging, and moving mentally forward.<br /><br />Upon the second listening of the album, the messages were even stronger.  This is perhaps the most intelligent album to be released in a long time.  Quite often, it seems today's music is written and produced by and for people early in their journey of intellectual evolution.  As I have grown up, and continued to try to challenge myself and think outside of the box...finding music that is still lyrically challenging and eye opening is a struggle.  But I am thankful Joni is writing from her older-wiser-and unfaltering perspective.  I relish her explorations of the human psyche on this album.  I relish her acknowledgement that people searching for true mental health and simplicity in this crazy world are pioneers.<br /><br />Listening to this album twice made me consider moderation.  In these days I feel our culture desperately needs to acknowledge the need for moderation.  For a few years I got so angry how people just wanted to have fun fun fun all the time mindlessly without consideration of consequence.  And in those years I was a grouch and a loner.  I do think there's a middle line.  People should have fun, people should dance.  But SHINE is a reminder how important it is to think, share, talk, and most importantly to just CARE.<br /><br />\\"If\\", the closing track on the album, is deeply profound and excitingly stimulating.  After years and years of feeling lost as a person without guidance...I am a person who isn't sold on organized religion...a person who tried but couldn't buy into the mantras and catch-phrases of the 12-step-program world...but still I try to be well in this world.  This song is a nice guideline to live by and it gives me a state of existence to strive for.<br /><br />Now, that I've written my initial thoughts...I am going to live with this album for awhile.  Hope everyone is well...may all your little lights shine...on this album have a similar classical feel.    The new version of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" was an immediate winner in my book.  The acoustic guitar shuffle was unlike anything we've heard from Joni, and it's not often a singer can reinvent one of their own songs this successfully.  Cyndi Lauper failed with her acoustic re-castings of her old catalog.  Mitchell herself tried to reinvent her back catalog with orchestral versions.  That project was hit and miss at best.  This time around, \\"Big Yellow Taxi 2007\\" has the eagerness and freshness of a brand new cut.  And the accordion  stabs were intentionally funny and refreshing on a such a ponderous album.    When initially reading this album I worried that it would be preachy.  But listening to it, it is not.  This album only stands as authentication that when Joni wrote her environmentally conscious music in the early 1970s, she really believed in what she was writing.  Her love for mother earth is unfailing and constant.  Through the years many of us (including myself) have fallen victim to the numbing society...the allure of living in the moment...the endless search for instant pleasures.  This album is a dark blue wake up call to start thinking, challenging, and moving mentally forward.    Upon the second listening of the album, the messages were even stronger.  This is perhaps the most intelligent album to be released in a long time.  Quite often, it seems today's music is written and produced by and for people early in their journey of intellectual evolution.  As I have grown up, and continued to try to challenge myself and think outside of the box...finding music that is still lyrically challenging and eye opening is a struggle.  But I am thankful Joni is writing from her older-wiser-and unfaltering perspective.  I relish her explorations of the human psyche on this album.  I relish her acknowledgement that people searching for true mental health and simplicity in this crazy world are pioneers.      Listening to thisalbum twice made me consider moderation.  In these days I feel our culture desperately needs to acknowledge the need for moderation.  For a few years I got so angry how people just wanted to have fun fun fun all the time mindlessly without consideration of consequence.  And in those years I was a grouch and a loner.  I do think there's a middle line.  People should have fun, people should dance.  But SHINE is a reminder how important it is to think, share, talk, and most importantly to just CARE.    \\"If\\", the closing track on the album, is deeply profound and excitingly stimulating.  After years and years of feeling lost as a person without guidance...I am a person who isn't sold on organized religion...a person who tried but couldn't buy into the mantras and catch-phrases of the 12-step-program world...but still I try to be well in this world.  This song is a nice guideline to live by and it gives me a state of existence to strive for.    Now, that I've written my initial thoughts...I am going to live with this album for awhile.  Hope everyone is well...may all your little lights shine...

B000UGG39Q|5.0|The monstrous southern rockers have returned! Seven years separate the first (1995) and second release (2002), and now five years of anticipation have crawled by since Down's last release, [[ASIN:B0000634EV Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow]]. Another anxious wait is over. The band (Phil Anselmo - Pantera; Pepper Keenan - Corrosion of Conformity; Rex Brown - Pantera; Kirk Windstein - Crowbar; Jimmy Bower - Eyehategod) had been on hiatus for several years and we, the fans, have wondered if we would ever hear the greatness of Down again. The impact these men have on the music world is incalculable. Not only do Anselmo and Brown continue to work together as an ex-Pantera duo (as Vinnie Paul and the late Dimebag did so in Damageplan), but the sounds emitted from the union of these five members are easily some of the best heard in the metal industry over the past ten years or so. What started out as a Pantera side project has turned into something epic, and metal heads around the world have rejoiced. Down now brings forth their third release, Down III: Over The Under.<br /><br />Anselmo is drug-free, Keenan has placed Corrosion of Conformity on hold, and the band has come together yet again. The setting: Louisiana. Picture five scruffy, but established, musicians in tattered clothing with instruments in their laps and beers in their hands. Now picture the instruments caked with mud, weeds, and anything else which could come straight out of a murky swamp. Assemble these images together and that's how the music sounds. What we might expect to hear: thirteen mammoth songs saturated with filthy, yet heavenly substance. What we'll get: exactly what we'd expect. Down continues to deliver the heavy metal that fans are accustomed to hearing from this band. They don't stray off their southern rock course they set back in their debut, [[ASIN:B000002HJR NOLA]], and are in cruise control from start to finish in Down III: Over The Under. While remaining in control album to album, this is perhaps the weakest of the three, but is still a strong effort regardless of comparison. Will we see a fourth release? Will it be within the next five to seven years? Only time will tell, and until then, embrace what we have and anticipate what we could have...rhaps the weakest of the three, but is still a strong effort regardless of comparison.

B0000035E7|5.0|this to me is the best album by nirvana.  It shows both Nevermind and In utero. Songs such as \\"about a girl\\" \\"blew\\" are pop like songs the you get into songs such as \\"sifting\\" these songs have a draker and more down and dirty feel to them. this album is also the only one that dave had not played on and you can tell. the drumming is way different a little more basic and not as smooth. although the album was done with 600$ i like the more raw true NIRVANA sound.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell's first album of new songs in nine years finds her mourning the sad state of the planet, but with a newfound acceptance that all things have their place in the universe (\\"bad dreams are good in the great plan,\\" as she puts it here, quoting her young grandson) -- including her own anger and disappointment.  Despite the numerous Robinson Jeffers-like call-outs of money/corruption/greed/rage/war and the incivility of humankind, the album does not end up being disheartening, but the opposite.  Her voice -- husky with age and chain-smoked American Spirits -- shines with a warrior's strength and defiance even in ragged armor, like Billie Holiday's late recordings.  And most wonderfully, Joni is still pushing her music into vital new territory, foregoing the synthesizer-guitar textures of \\"Taming the Tiger\\" for piano, horns, percussion, and other warmly organic voices.<br /><br />She boldly opens the album with an instrumental, which struck me as an ungenerous move on first hearing, but in the context of the rest of the album makes perfect sense on Joni's terms, which are the only terms on which she makes records, bless her.  (Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young -- her true peers -- also specialized in weirding out listeners who expected more-of-the-same with each new record.)  Every song gets a distinctive orchestration of its own, from the percolating \\"Hana\\" -- a portrait of an old movie heroine, an Irish bodhisattva disguised as a traveling maid, who had \\"a special knack for getting people back on the right track\\" -- to a playful reprise of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" rescored like French circus music.  \\"This Place\\" has particularly sleek and engaging sound, blending lap steel, warm horns, and bright keyboards, with its reference to a neighbor in rural British Columbia who says, \\"When I get to heaven, if it is not like this, I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming back down here...\\"<br /><br />My favorite track on the album is the final one, \\"If,\\" which advances the sinuous groove of \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" and \\"Don't Interrupt the Sorrow\\" and other milestones into new realms.  The lyric is paraphrased from a Rudyard Kipling poem, but Joni wrote the most stunning verse:<br /><br />If you can fill the journey<br />of a minute<br />with sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight<br />then the Earth is yours<br />and Everything that's in it<br />but more than that<br />I know<br />You'll be alright<br />You'll be alright.<br /><br />Fittingly, the title track \\"Shine\\" is the purest expression of the essence of this album.  After reciting a litany of offenses against the spirit, she insists that the proper response is to \\"shine your little light\\" into every corner of your life.  It's not polyannic New Agey jive, but more like the alchemy of heavy global lead into spiritual gold: with this song, Joni even transcends her own identity as an angry Cassandra issuing dire warnings to a culture that doesn't want to listen.  She's no stranger to Buddhist subtexts in her work --  \\"Refuge of the Roads\\" on Hejira was, among other things, a tribute to the vajrayana master Chogyam Trungpa, and \\"Taming the Tiger\\" was an allusion to Tibetan meditation practices for quelling the ego's rages.  In \\"Shine,\\" the Buddhist analogue would be Dzogchen, the Great Perfection -- the recognition that everything is just right as it is, even the things that insult the ego and bruise the heart.<br /><br />We're lucky to be alive on the same dying planet that she is.of \\"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire\\" and \\"Don't Interrupt the Sorrow\\" and other milestones into new realms.

B00005JPFH|4.0|I don't understand why Spider-Man 3 is getting an unfair rap from most people. I can tell you this, those that are giving it one star will probably be right there in line waiting to pick up a copy when it hits stores.    Spider-Man 3 features Peter Parker facing his greatest challenge yet. Not only must he juggle his alter ego Spider-Man, but he must face three dangerous and deadly foes. What will happen to Spider-Man and what will be left of him (Sorry, I had to throw in a Texas Chainsaw Massacre line)    Regardless of what people say about this film, it accomplishes what it set out to do. It is a 2+ hour thrill ride and is very entertaining. Sam Raimi and Co. have crafted a wonderful trilogy, and Spider-Man 3 caps things off nicely.     If they decide to make a fourth film, my only advice is to use one villian. Don't give in to studio pressure. As with the other Spider-Man flicks, Spider-Man 3 holds up well, it's different than the others, but at the same time, very funny and highly entertaining. Pick this one up now.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|While many people invest much talk into the \\"hip-hop\\" showdown which was September 11, 2007, I knew that it was a one-sided war.  Sure, 50 Cent has had two albums debut at #1 with one surpassing 1 million units its first week and the debut approaching 1 million, but 50 has shedded some of his \\"umph\\" and I knew Kanye would have no problem outselling/making a better album than 50. That isn't to sell 50 short because his album is good, though it it isn't fresh like the excellent follow-up Kanye presents to us via GRADUATION. Sure, there is no \\"Jesus Walks\\" or \\"All Falls Down\\", but there is the 'fiery' \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\", the addictive \\"Stronger\\", and the pop hit \\"Good Life\\" featuring the ubiquitous R&B/hip-hop force T-Pain (or Akon #2 if you wish).  What makes GRADUATION so good is that it is again different from Kanye's previous work.  Kanye isn't afraid to take risks and GRADUATION shows this no better than the Daft Punk sampling second single \\"Stronger\\".<br /><br />The album starts off strong with \\"Good Morning\\" which uses a hot sample in which Kanye succesfully incorporates the \\"collegiate\\" theme into his rhymes and even comes off a bit hard as he raps.  Greater though is the great \\"Champion\\" with one of the year's most addictive hooks: \\"Did you realize/that you were a champion in their eyes\\".  For those who initially thought there was no \\"Touch the Sky\\" on GRADUATION, look no further than \\"Champion\\".  \\"Stronger\\" follows and gives West the second solo number one of his career following the massive \\"Gold Digger\\" (he's also had a #1 on Twista's \\"Slow Jamz\\"). Sure, it isn't quite as addictive as \\"Gold Digger\\", but it has definitely got hit written all over it.  \\"I Wonder\\" finds West stretching out a bit with his rhyming patterns, though I personally think it is forgettable in comparison to the very best of this overall exceptional affair.<br /><br />\\"Good Life\\" featuring T-Pain is perhaps the most commercial track of West's Career that could add a third-number one solo hit to his arsenal. T-Pain is definitely in after his slew of collaborations and hits himself, so it can do nothing but add more radio airplay to the track.  \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing\\" started slow where radio airplay was concerned but for me it is my very favorite track of GRADUATION and it has 'fire' written all over it; one of Kanye's best tracks to date in my opinion.  \\"Barry Bonds\\" is one of the years best collaborative rap efforts with two of the hottest MCs in the game exchanging verses. \\"Drunk and Hot Girls\\" is also strong, though sometimes it is so monotone during the hook that it is trying to listen to after continuous listens. Still fire. Dwele's guest turn on \\"Flashing Lights\\" is great while the piano laden \\"Everything I Am\\" is another home run.  \\"The Glory\\" features an addictive sample while Chris Martin featured \\"Homecoming\\" easily trumps Jay-Z's Coldplay frontman feature from KINGDOM COME (Martin sang on \\"Beach Chair for Hov). \\"Big Brother\\" brings a tear to anyone's eye and I'm sure Jay-Z feels very honored by Kanye's closing number.<br /><br />To say that GRADUATION is better than LATE REGISTRATION or THE COLLEGE DROPOUT is an overstatement. I think it is consistent with LATE REGISTRATION and close enough to Kanye's classic, THE COLLEGE DROPOUT. By making the September cutoff, I'm sure West will see yet another Album of the Year nomination. The question now is, will he ever win for his prodigous talents?  4 stars for me.his arsenal.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|First I should say, I absolutely loved seeing Grindhouse in the theater as it was meant to be seen. The dvd destroys the whole experience. First off, the trailers, for some stupid, unknown reason, are gone. The special features have trailers for new hollywood movies. The added deleted scenes add nothing to the movie,  some are even annoying, particularly the lap dance scene. The dvd packaging is nothing to write home about either. There was absolutely no reason to separate Death Proof from Planet Terror. If you enjoy paying more money for less, you are a moron. I will not buy Planet Terror, I'll just grab a bootleg copy of the theatrical version of the the complete film(s). You should to.
B00003CXXS|3.0|When Erik Kirby goes missing on Isla Sorna (InGen's Site B), his parents, Paul and Amanda, hire Dr. Alan Grant under the pretense of a \\"tour\\" in order to find him.<br /><br />The plane crashes and Alan finds himself back in the same situation he's been trying so hard to forget: being trapped in Jurassic Park.<br /><br />Sam Neill as Alan Grant is one of my favorite performances ever. There's such an air of seriousness and intensity that Sam brings to the role every time. He can be funny, sure, but his character presentation commands a respect from his fellow actors that you don't see that often in film.<br /><br />William H. Macy, another favorite of mine, plays Paul Kirby, the bumbling yet-trying-to-be-cool dad. Terrific. He was serious, clumsy, just fantastic. Every film Macy's in has never let me down and this movie delivers a wonderful Macy performance. There's something about the pacing of his line delivery that gets to me, too. It's a guy who's insecure but tries his best to put a confident spin on things no matter what.<br /><br />The dinosaurs, as always, look real. They're huge, they're scary, they're loud. The only problem with these Jurassic sequels is the dinosaurs aren't new and terrifying anymore. They were in the first movie, not so much now. However, there are a few dino attacks in Jurassic Park 3 that weren't in the others, making the viewing of this film worthwhile.<br /><br />Michael Jeter (The Green Mile), Laura Dern (Jurassic Park), John Diehl (Pearl Harbor) and T&eacute;a Leoni (A League of Their Own) also star.<br /><br />Language warning: Cursing and blasphemy<br /><br />A.P. Fuchs
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I completely Disagree with Amazons review.This soundtrack is truly a work of art.The music is pure metal at its finest.There is no polishing up of the music to bring in more sales because that would spoil the whole story. The music is haunting with special background sound to further enhance the experience. Nikki's vocals are the finishing touch to an already perfect album. I suggest the album and book together!This is not only a must see for former and current fans of motley but for any teen who is struggling in todays times
B000002H6C|3.0|My theory is that Metallica was infected with the disease of Selling out as soon as Cliff died, and AFJA proves this, I don't think this is a bad album, nor do I think it's essential. With Cliff Burton's death and a new Bassist, namely Jason Newsted, they began a new era.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />-Jason is actually a good basist, and whilst sucking compared to Cliff, he's still good.<br />-One is basically the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" of metal, it rocks.<br />-Actually a bit longer than most of their old albums, this one is 9 tracks.<br />-One has one of the best guitar solos ever!<br />-Kirk's guitar playing has grown better over the years.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-The album is BADLY produced. I nearly cried when I heard the production, it was awful. I wish that it was remixed...<br />-...which brings us to our next con: SO WE CAN HEAR JASON'S BASS PLAYING. The album's so quiet you can hardly hear the bass!!<br />-All the songs are structured out in the same way. I like the songs, but they all sound the same.<br />-Some songs drag on for way too long, and some are even repetative. Eye of the Beholder is good for about 3 minutes, but then just repeats itself.<br /><br />So this is not a bad album, just not essential, is all. Only buy it if you are just getting into 'Tallica.

THE ILLASTATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED WERE VERY COOL. I'M DEFFENETLY GLAD I READ IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I JUST RENTED IT FROM THE LIBARY. I DON'T THINK IT WILL ADD MUCH TO MY BOOK COLLECTION. ALL IN ALL I GIVE IT THREE STARS OUT OF FIVE.

This self-taught musician returns to his homeland in Greece with the full orchestra of the Royal Philmarmonic. The violin duet on WITHIN ATTRACTION starring Karen Briggs and Shardad Rohani is amazing! This music is guaranteed to lift you up.
B00004XPPC|5.0|David Lean directed this classic, masterpiece in 1957, right before he began work on Lawrence of Arabia. It is filled with<br />richness in theme, narrative, and characterization and supported by an incredible cast. This film describes the horrors of war and man's pyschological struggle to find meaning and survival amidst the horror.<br />Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been charged with building a vitally important railway bridge but his efforts are failing and only by soliciting help with a British prisoner, the charismatic Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), can he accomplish his task but this escalates into a duel of honor, Nicholson defying his captor's demands to win concessions for his troops. How the two officers reach a compromise, and Nicholson becomes obsessed with building that bridge, provides the story's thematic spine. Meanwhile an American escapee (William Holden) leads a commando raid to blow up the bridge. Alec Guinness won a much deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work. His realization at what he's sacrificed to keep his troops morale and survival is astonishing.

It is an incredibly eye-opening experience to the lives of people-and especially-the plight of women in Afghanistan.  It made me incredibly thankful for where I live-I don't know how I can not express gratitude DAILY for the many freedoms and basic rights we enjoy living in the United States.  This is a highly educational novel for the adult reader, and out of chaos in the world over there comes a beautiful, touching story.
6305364648|5.0|True Lies needs a special collector's edition for us \\"diehard\\" fans. I want to see a retrospective documentary. What does Jamie, Tom, Arnie or even Bill think about being in this odd cult classic? How does James Cameron feel when he looks back on his True Lies experience?    Does anyone know that the idea to make this came from Arnold? Yeah, Arnold and Jim were sitting at breakfast. Cameron asked him what he wanted do next. And Arnold replied that he had just seen a French film, and thought the lead would be a great role for him. Cameron was interested right away, because this was the first time Arnie wanted to do a picture because of the character. Arnold also didn't like the idea of Jamie being his leading lady at first. Thank God Cameron eventually convinced him otherwise.    This is a great, fun classic film in the same league as oh, say, Raiders of the Lost Ark. It deserves a special edition with retrospective interviews and such. Not to say that some other Cameron film releases - certain ones about giant boats doesn't need a retrospective documentary. I mean, what the heck, they give us millions of documentaries for T2, but not for True Lies or Titanic??

B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell has enjoyed a career that spans all genres; she has dipped her toe in the lakes of folk rock, pop, jazz and world music, to name but a few of her musical adventures. Many fans would like to preserve her in the mold of \\" Blue\\" or \\" Court and Spark\\", which ever of these discs spoke to them in the most profound way. \\"Shine\\" proves what Ms. Mitchell herself has contended all along. She must be allowed to follow her muse. Given that freedom, she can produce some wonderous results.<br /><br />Above all, Ms. Mitchell is a story teller of the first order, capable of poetically synthesizing  complex events/emotions into musical form. \\" One Week Last Summer\\", the opening track, displays a gift for expressing inspiration without words. Revisit \\" Court and Spark\\" and see if this ability was not present in \\"Down to You\\". Mitch takes this and stretches it to accomodate her renewed interest in the musical arts. She has once again found her voice.<br /><br />The concept ( all Mitchell recordings are concept driven) involves the insanity of war, both humanity against one another and the war we have waged with our planet. The remake of \\" Big Yellow Taxi\\" shows how relevant that song should have been upon its release thirty seven years ago. Joni saw it, yet few others did. With an accordian and slightly revamped lyrics she tries again to ring the alarm....albeit in a playful manner.<br /><br />Maintaining a good heart is one of the secrets of life. Without claiming too much space it can be said that \\"Shine\\" encourages us to keep the faith, do our part, and mind the heart, regulating the cynicism inherent in living through modern times. The musicality is  first rate, with Mitch playing the piano as well, or better, than we've ever heard. Highly recommended for Joniphiles and new fans alike.

B000NQPZUQ|5.0|\\"Black Earth\\" was Arch Enemy's first album and had Johan Liiva on vocals. Arch Enemy's old material seem to be buried by newer fans now because of the Angela Gossow era. Such a shame because Johan's era was still a good time for Arch Enemy - this CD is probably one of their heaviest and most aggressive. Of course, it's much more darker sounding as well as Liiva has deeper vocals than Angela Gossow does, but I think any fan of Arch Enemy needs to hear what they sounded like in the beginning. You'll be able to tell the difference of the sound of the 2 eras, but it still sounds like Arch Enemy!    This remaster has a very good boost in sound quality from the original with sound just like the Angela Gossow era. Highly recommended for all Arch Enemy fans and fans of melodic death metal!

Of course, the \\"very best\\" of anyone's work is subjective and this is missing some of her early work from \\"All For You\\"(\\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" would have been a good fit), and the outtakes that represent her \\"new songs\\" are satisfactory.  \\"Temptation\\" would also have been a good choice.  Overall, 4 stars.  And pick up the version with the DVD included.  And get \\"Live In Paris\\" in any version!

B000MRAAJW|4.0|This is a great video notice I gave it four stars would give 4.8 if an option. The only problem and I think it is huge is that the video has mosquito noise problem in some parts of the movie. At first I though my TV was busted however after more research it appears the BBC even admits to the problem and many people get the \\"noise\\" on the same parts and only those parts!  Would I buy it again yes! And amazon's price is great. I just wanted people to know that the problem lies in the DVD and not your system to save others time and frustration.<br /><br />If you don't believe me do a Google/yahoo search on planet earth noise?

B0006GAOBI|5.0|If you watched the 'making of' features of the original version DVD this is the longer version those deleted scenes would have creaed. Outstanding, but clearly a movie on the borders of science fiction, reiligion and philosophy is for folks in a contemplative mood who are willing to think about it.

1569242739|5.0|This cookbook is wonderful.  The recipes are easy enough that my 9 year old (who went vegan on his own when he was 8) is able to kick me out of the kitchen and create light, moist, delicious treats without me anywhere in sight.<br /><br />We love the variety of recipes and variations on themes that Isa Chandra and Terry Hope have created.  The lemon cupcake with blueberry compote and lemon buttercream frosting is such a favorite that a neighbor actually commissioned my son to bake some for an event for which she was providing desserts!<br /><br />I would recommend this cookbook to anyone, vegan or not, who wants to bake from scratch and have a consistantly delicious product at the end.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I must say that it was with some trepidation that I sat down to view the 60th Anniversary Edition of Walt Disney's Fantasia. I remember being forced to see the cut version some 30 years ago when I was in second or third grade and being bored to tears. After viewing the movie again in its restored \\"Road Show\\" edition I have to admit I was impressed. The DVD edition features the restored interstitials of Deems Taylor explaining each piece of music and the narration makes a difference. It is also that the film has not aged at all in its turbulent 67 year history. It is as fresh today as it was for those audiences in 1940.<br /><br />Fantasia was designed as a new entertainment experience. Not quite film not quite concert. The film features classical music set to the work of some of Disney's greatest animators. The selections range fronm the abstraction of Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor, to the experimental Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, to the sublime Ave Maria by Schubert.<br /><br />The centerpiece and section that started it all was Paul Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice starring Mickey Mouse. It was this section that got legendary conductor Leopold Stokowski interested. Other highlights include Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and the Pastoral Symphony by Beethovan.<br /><br />The disc features an excellent featurette on the history of the film and two excellent commentaries  explaining the genesis and influence of the film on filmaking in general and animation in particular. The second commentary is a one of a kind interview with Walt Disney that was recorded by animation historian John Canemaker from over three decades of archival material.<br /><br />This is a must own DVD of one of the most influential American films ever released.
B000FUF6QS|4.0|I watched both versions of this film, first the relatively new one, with Nicholas Cage, and then, after seeing other reviews of that one, I decided I had to see this one before I could even think of writing a review. It's true, this one is better, richer in detail, far more authentic.<br /><br />Neither movie, however, is what I expected or hoped for; a statement about what is happening to missing children today, so I might cite the promoters for false advertising. Other than that, it is a serious look at the history of paganism and an eye-opening, thought-provoking journey through alternative belief systems in their historic context.<br /><br />What seems strange to us may be perfectly normal for someone else; and what makes perfect sense to us may be worth taking a second look at from someone else's perspective.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006CXH4 Keep the River on Your Right - A Modern Cannibal Tale]]

068485743X|5.0|Noah Lukeman's The First Five Pages is the best book I've read about writing.  Period.  (Oops!  Stephen King's is the best, as well.)     As a writer, I've read at least two dozen books on the art and techniques of writing.  The depth and breadth of Lukeman's knowledge is unsurpassed.  That the material is so well organized is important because there is so much packed into this book.      Really, it's not so much about getting published as writing a superior book.  Publishable because it is a REALLY REALLY GOOD book.      He asks the right questions, those that guide you to dig deeper and then deeper still, to create the elements in plotting and characterization, and a lot of other things (which I can't tell you right now because someone else has borrowed my copy again and I can't refer to it), that make a book meaningful.  A work that can affect a change in the reader.       Lukeman inspires me to tell the stories that rattle in my brain or beat to escape my heart, because they need to be told.  And heard.

0307383415|5.0|Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama is a moving, eloquent and honest book that was originally published in 1995.  This is an amazing story, and not just because he is a presidential candidate.  Although autobiographical in scope, it is not intended to be a complete history of the author's life.  Instead, it is \\"a boy's search for his father.\\"<br /><br />Barack Obama had a most unusual childhood.  His mother was a white American living in Hawaii.  His father, Barack Obama Sr., was a brilliant black Kenyan who received a college scholarship to the University of Hawaii.  When Obama was two, his father graduated college and received a scholarship to obtain his PhD at Harvard.  Unfortunately, the scholarship did not include living expenses for his family, and this proved the end of the marriage.  After that, Obama only saw his father one more time before being killed in an auto accident when Obama was 21.  Obama's mother subsequently married a man from Indoesia, where Obama lived for several years.  But that marriage also ended and Obama returned to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.  Dreams from My Father also includes Obama's  college experiences, as well as the work he did as an organizer in Chicago.<br /><br />The most moving part of Dreams from My Father involves his trip to Kenya for the first time several years after his father died. As a youth, he describes the reaction of others when they discover his background \\"Privately, they guess at my troubled heart, I supposed--the mixed blood, the divided soul, the ghostly image of a tragic mulatto trapped between two worlds.\\"  In Kenya, he meets his African family including grandparents, half-brothers and sisters, step-mothers, aunts, uncles and cousins.  At the Kenyan airport, an airport employee recognizes his name and knew his father.  \\"For the first time in my life, I felt the comfort, the firmness of identity that a name might provide, how it could carry an entire history in other people's memories...My name belonged and so I belonged.\\"  I was also moved by Obama's discovery of faith.<br /><br />Even if Obama was not a presidential candidate for the 2008 election, Dreams is still an eloquent and inspirational story about his search for his father and his efforts to reconcile the histories of this white and black families.ories...My name belonged and so I belonged.\\"  I was also moved by Obama's discovery of faith.    Even if Obama was not a presidential candidate for the 2008 election, Dreams is still an eloquent and inspirational story about his search for his father and his efforts to reconcile the histories of this white and black families.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|I'm baffled at people throwing out 4 and 5 star reviews of this thing.  It's an interesting conspiracy theory film for about 40 minutes, but it rapidly slips into a typical one guy versus the entire military- by the numbers action movie.  If they chose Arnold to play Swagger it would fit better because this would be right up his alley.  I don't want to get too picky, but they never explain why Swagger fights like a Navy Seal and has maintained his ninja-like skills even while living alone in the woods for three years.  Was he practicing on the dog?  On trees?  He was a sniper in the Marines not a Green Beret trained to take on a small army by himself!  I've also noticed a trend in Hollywood these days to always make the FBI look like a bunch of clowns, but the local cops look like heroes.  And the military ALWAYS comes off looking like ninjas who can fight their way out of a small war zone with a bottle of water and a toothbrush.  This gets 2 stars for lack of creativity and it's pro-military anti-government barbs.
0316010669|2.0|I'm sorry, I must be way out in left field or somewhere. I missed something. I stayed with the boring statistics but Life is short, so get to the nitty gritty, and give us what you promised. Unfortunately the author doesn't follow through. It's been referred to as a hunch, a sixth sense, even just a feeling. And we're probably all familiar with this stuff. Nothing new here at all, however, it would have been nice if a smidgen of information regarding how one could use the information reliably was provided as promised. Who are they that give high ratings to this ilk. Hey, I want my money back.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|There can be no better way than bring brightness to life than watching Disney's Mary Poppins.  The cast could not have been selected better and the music is enchanting (sing along words are included in this dvd) The story takes us back to glory days of the Empire and is a great lesson about kindness and empathy.  Great as a family film or for anyone.  This particular dvd set has excellent colour and clarity.  A must purchase for anyone who loves musicals.

B000RIHBIE|4.0|While it's no All Killer No Filler, nor is it a Does This Look Infected?, Underclass Hero, upon the third or fourth listen, definately holds its own. At first you'll be completely unsatisfied, as it holds a lot of songs that are quite unlike sum41 (imo)... but after a few listens, you'll be amazed at how you thought poorly of it before. A strong 4/5.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I was one of the fortunate souls that got to see Grindhouse in the theaters. I liked it so much; I took another friend and saw it twice. When I first heard that Death Proof was going to be released separately, I was naturally ready to join the ranks of the boycotters, feeling this was another attempt at making more money. But Death Proof by itself is an amazing Quentin Tee film, and I won't pass up the chance to own it, as I do most of his films.     I haven't read all 100 or so reviews here on Amazon, but from the many I have read, no one has pointed out what was only obvious to me the first time I watched Death Proof with the NON-Grindhouse crowd. Now, it may only seem like a trivial thing, but I liked the fact that there were characters from the 1st half of Grindhouse (Planet Terror) used in the 2nd half (Death Proof). You have to have seen Planet Terror to appreciate the over-lap. Like the nurse in the hospital scene. Or the crazy twin babysitters in the bar where  Stuntman Mike meets Rose McGowan. That to me is the real issue with splitting them up. But, maybe that's just one cool thing that the rest of us privileged Grindhouse fans will always have to ourselves. Everyone else who missed that theater experience, will only get to see the DVD with the new (originally cut) scenes.  But those who saw the Grindhouse films in the theater will always have those (hey, I remember that character!) moments.    Buy them both, you won't regret it.

The best thing I can recognize about this album is she's switched gears from pissed off into a gratitude mode.  This fares well for long time fans.      Strong ones for me:      Shine, because she floating like Passion Play.     If, because the set is so tight and crafted with quirky in all the right places.

0978607651|5.0|I need help. I cannot stop looking at this book. I have other things to do today but none more inspirational than looking through this beautiful thing. Charley Harper had so many styles and such a joyful way to look at the world that his work can't help but bring a smile to your face. His sense of design, color and composition are remarkable.    As for the book, it is a work of art unto itself. It's huge. It has a slipcase. It has it's own customized box. It beautifully printed.  It is designed and noted by Todd Oldham who has taken obvious pleasure in bringing Charley Harper's work to a wider audience.    My recommendation, buy two. One for you and one to give away to your favorite creative person. Now let me get back to obsessing about Charley Harper!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The new packaging and extra bonus features are very tasty frosting for the cake known as Serenity. I love this movie, as well as the series, and part of my motivation for buying this disc (which I already had in the regular DVD release) was to bolster support for the resurrection of the franchise. If we can show that the fans are out there, perhaps some network will pick it up and give us more episodes of Firefly (or Serenity, or whatever they decide to call a new show!) It happened once before, after all...Star Trek was a failed TV show that got resurrected becuse the fans wouldn't quit asking for more. Let's show that we want more Of Cap'n Malcom and his great crew, especially if they can find some way to bring back Wash once in a while. (Flashbacks anyone?)

0143038419|5.0|I want to eat in Italy.  No, I want to live in an Ashram and pray in India.  No, wrong again, I want to live and love in Indonesia.  What a book!  I just loved everything about it.  I was transformed into the writer each stop along the way.  Her ability and talent to make situations real is astounding.  She does so with respect, dignity and humor and makes one want to experience what she's exprience.  Luca Sphagetti, the wonderful, simple and funny Italian is everyone's friend; Richard from Texas would be a treasure to meet; and the Indonesian health healer in Bali is instantly lovable.  The pure love that Liz (Grocery Girl) shares with Richard are absolutely built on respect and non-sexual love.  Felix is a man for all women and any one of us would be lucky to love and be loved by him.  This book is uplifting, inspirational, and one of the very best of my recent reads.  I highly, higly recommend it for lovers of goodness, humor, understanding, sympathy and motivation.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Sky Blue Sky kicks the wilder side of Wilco.  Gone are the long sections of strange noise like on A Ghost is Born.  Tweedy's vocals blend brilliantly with the band to form a sound that is instantly recognizable, yet familiar, despite a departure from the style of their last two albums.      The album doesn't offend at any point, but at the same time, the high points aren't as impressive as those on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or A Ghost is Born.  All in all, I like it more than A Ghost is Born, but I don't think it will replace Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as my favourite album of Wilco's.
B000QUD0LA|5.0|This DVD is a must for any history and landscape lover.

B000A0GP0Y|4.0|This movie was all laughs from beginning to end.    A remake of the 1974 film of the same name. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, an former NFL player who was kicked out of the sport after being suspected of throwing a game.  Down on his luck, Paul Crewe gets thrown into jail after drunkingly driving his girlfriend's car on national television.    While in jail he is convinced to put together a football team made up entirely of convicts to go against the prison guards.  Burt Renolds, who starred as Paul Crewe in the 1974 movie, plays the coach of the Mean Machine team.  Chris Rock also plays Caretaker who comes up with many of the plays.  The rap artist Nelly plays a very fast running back and James Cromwell, the warden from The Green Mile, plays the Warden of the jail in this movie.    A lot of this movie is a scene by scene, line by line remake of the original except that a lot of the language and racial references were toned down.  The original movie was rated R but I think they figured out that they would make more money with a PG-13 movie and replaced all but one F-word with substitutes, most of them being the more widely accepted S-word.  This might have worked because the movie actually made some decent money and the teenage crowd was a large contributor to the ticket sales.  In fact, I wouldn't have seen this if it had retained its R rating.    I think most would agree that this wasn't as good as the original, but it is still just as funny though a lot of the darker humor from the original movie has been replaced with something a bit more slapstick.  There are many running gags but the one that killed me the most was replacing one guard's steroids with female hormones instead.  Throughout the movie you see him acting more and more feminine.  Of course, hillarity ensues.      I wouldn't recommend this for any youngster as they flirted with an R rating and probably came just short of earning it.  If you are looking for a movie that will inspire you to be good ormake you a better person, this is not it.  This movie is just for those who are looking for a fun time and are willing to look past the unreality of it all.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I love this movie, lots of actions and special effects, don't miss it, comic book fan or not, you will not be disappointed; great movie but it or rent it!
4789009637|3.0|This book may be good for young students who anticipate homestays (and I'm skeptical even about that, for reasons below), but if you're an adult you may find this book excruciating. I recently moved to Japan, and finally determined to take some private lessons to get a more systematic grasp on the language than I have had hitherto. My school uses this text. I can't compare it with other college-style textbooks, which may mostly suffer from the same problems, but among the issues I have with it are:    @ The framing scenario is of foreign students living in homestays and interacting with their homestay families and with each other; there is also a lot of school-related vocabluary. This is largely irrelevant for an adult's experience. It is useless for business, BTW (though in my own case, I was looking more for daily life vocabulary and situations than business).    @ Even within this scenario, the book doesn't teach you how to really have conversation -- all classmates address each other with polite \\"-masu\\" form verbs. In real life, this would be distant or even rude with your pals. (Moreover, on the accompanying tapes female gaijin characters like \\"Mary\\" and \\"Sue\\" address their classmates and homestay parents in that saccharine, squeaky little-girl voice that is normally used by shop staff and female announcers on infomercials, not people talking to friends or family.)    @ In Japan, it is very rare for people to mirror back to you what you say, or for it to be appropriate for you to mirror back to them. This is especially true if your main interactions are with people in shops, where they will use a lot of \\"keigo\\" (honorific speech) or other specialized formulas. Simple example: A waitress will bring stuff to your table and ask \\"Yoroshii desu ka?\\" (Is that OK?), you don't answer back \\"Hai, yoroshii desu.\\" Even saying goodbye is highly context dependent; e.g. when someone says \\"Sorry I'm being so rude as to leave before you,\\" even if you can catch the Japanese phrase you will look like an idiot if you reply symmetrically (been there, done that). This book doesn't give you a clue about dealing with such situations, nor help you to unravel what Japanese people are saying to you when they respond to your questions or remarks. All dialogues and exercises are based on the mirroring principle (as well as indiscriminate use of \\"wa\\", the topic particle). So it's pretty useless for practical purposes -- unless you plan to use Japanese in class only.     @ While it's a plus that reading & writing practice are integrated into the text, the reading selections in early chapters are devoid of imagination. After several chapters of reading stuff like \\"Are you OK? I am fine. It's cold here in Japan. I took some pictures, studied Japanese and took a bath. My father is nice, but very busy,\\" and so on, you just want to scream.    @ Although the publication date is 1999, at which time a dot-com boom was beginning even in Japan, this book is snail-mail all the way: you spend time learning about stamps and postcards, but there isn't anything about email, the Internet or texting. (Forget also about DVDs -- people watch videos.)    @ Japanese verb conjugation has a wonderful regularity, in that almost every verb has a set of stems that are based variously on -A-, -I-, -U-, -E- and -O- (e.g., negative, polite, dictionary, causative and \\"let's\\" forms, respectively). This tracks the order of Japanese vowels in the kana writing systems, so it's easy to remember. However, \\"Genki\\"'s presentation of verbs obliterates this useful pattern (see, e.g. conjugation chart @ 344 of Vol. I).    @  The book lacks any review chapters, appendices, exercises or quizzes to help you consolidate what you've learned in a chunk of preceding chapters. Schools don't necessarily take the initiative to review the material every now and then, so you may need to request special quizzes to force yourself to review stuff you studied weeks earlier. My teachers were amenable when asked, though my lessons are one-on-one, and this might be more difficult to do if the book is used in a class situation (you might ask about that before you sign up). If you're using the book to study on your own, you're on your own with this too.    Like most students of Japanese, I've stocked up on a shelfload of other books of varying usefulness. (Two of the best, Rita Lampkin's \\"Japanese: Verbs and Essentials of Grammar\\" and Jay Rubin's \\"Making Sense of Japanese\\", unfortunately are exclusively in Roman characters, or nearly so.) You will definitely need to to the same (or at least half a shelfload) if you use this book. But not getting bored by the boook will be a bigger challenge if you're older than 22. One possible tip might be to look for a book that has at least one gaijin co-author. This one is written entirely by Japanese authors; it could have benefitted from the perspective of a formerly-puzzled foreigner.    PS ADDED 2009/01: Now that I have more experience with Genki 2, I feel there are several additional caveats for prospective users of this text. First, the good news is that you learn more informal usage, and a little bit of polite language, especially in Genki 2. Unfortunately, many of the informal expressions are *too* informal, including several that I have never heard any educated person use, and which my wife (a native speaker) and my teacher (ditto) confirmed they would never use, even at home with family. This means that, especially in Genki 2, you can expect a constant struggle to calibrate the text with the spoken language; my teachers even skip some of the material because it's wrong or incomplete.     Also, more bad news if you're hoping to take the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. Although Genki 2 will get you into some of the Level 3 material, the set of Genki 1+2 still doesn't cover all the material even for Level 4 (the easiest level). I was amazed, and kind of steamed, at the new vocabulary (several dozen words -- all of them traditional, not new words that have become current since Genki was published) and grammatical constructions I had to learn just for the most basic level. And as one commenter noted, the sentence structures used in Level 4 are more complex than in Genki. This is not too tough to remedy, since there's plenty of review material available from other vendors. But given that the textbook was prepared in Japan by a Japanese publisher (The Japan Times, the leading local English-language newspaper here), this gap is more surprising. Please consider this before you embark on a course with Genki. You might want to check out the 2008 revision of \\"Everyone's Japanese/Minna no nihongo\\" -- not easy, but one that my teachers often use when Genki is wrong or obtuse.

6305079811|5.0|When I was a kid, I remember seeing a preview in the movie theater for something called \\"Flash Gordon\\".  A confusing cascade of gaudy sets, laser blasts, explosions, and the fact that the hero had my last name was all it took to sell me on this one.  It was only years later that I found out the movie I loved so dearly was, in fact, considered a flop.  No matter, as Flash Gordon was part of a generation of films, between the release of Star Wars, and the release of Terminator 2, where big-budget didn't necessarily mean corporate calculations and focus-testing resulting in lifeless blockbusters such as \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  A movie could be ambitious, and do it with personality, whether it was the moody ambience of John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\", the Muppets-on-steroids fairy tale musings of \\"The Never-Ending Story\\", or the stop-motion monsters and heroics of \\"Clash of the Titans\\".<br /><br />  \\"Flash Gordon's\\" strength lies in its shameless will to entertain, and pull the audience along for an over-the-top, goofy ride.  When affable football star Flash Gordon and demure travel agent Dale Arden share an airplane ride together, all hell breaks loose when the destructive forces of space tyrant Ming start messing with Earth's weather, thus forcing Flash to crash land the suddenly pilot-less plane on Dr. Hans Zarkov's greenhouse.  Zarkov, having determined the moon is being pushed toward the Earth by alien forces, \\"accidentally\\" kidnaps Flash and Dale, and they take off in his phallic rocket of hope to try to save Earth.  When they reach the alien system of Mongo, which for some reason seems to mostly consist of floating fragments of planets, they are taken before Ming.  Of course, that's where the real fun begins.<br /><br />  There are some truly memorable and campy performances here, whether it's Max Von Sydow's scene-stealing Ming, Timothy Dalton's 9-degrees-more-serious-than-everyone-else Prince Barin, or Brian Blessed's lovingly loud and jovial Vultan the Hawkman.  The sets are blindingly colorful, and the special effects are by turns psychadelic, tacky and vivid.  And then there's the heavenly soundtrack by Queen, whose ridiculous amounts of talent were quite suited for a movie that lived by the credo \\"more is more\\".  The movie jolts along at a brisk pace, as Flash, Dale and Zarkov haplessly fall into various situations, each one more over the top than the last.  One of the best aspects of the movie is seeing our heroes, being plucked from mundane everyday life, and being placed in this garish otherworldly adventure.<br /><br />  This movie is so fun, that it literally enrages me that Sci-Fi Channel recently took the Flash Gordon property, and soiled it by converting it into an utterly mundane and cheap TV show, run by bean counters so tight-fisted with money that their version of Hawkmen don't even have wings- they have ragged capes.  Give me \\"Flash Gordon approaching on a Hawkman rocketcycle\\" anyday over a warmed-over, cheap Smallville/Charmed wannabe filled with oh-so-self-aware cutesy dialogue even Kevin Smith would think twice about writing.<br /><br />  The only good thing about the Sci-Fi Channel \\"remake\\" series is that it prompted the re-release of this movie on DVD in 2007.  Therefore, this particular DVD issue is no longer needed.  The actual quality of the transfer for the 1998 DVD release is rather grainy and dirty, and there are no extras.  The \\"Saviour of the Universe\\" edition is apparently remastered, and is priced normally, as opposed to the now out-of-print 1998 version.  In any case, this movie is a must have, as a memento of a time when \\"event\\" movie-making was more of an art than a rote science.

B0009HLD0K|5.0|Breaking Away is the forgotten classic of 1979. The story of Dave Stoller the Bloomington \\"cutter\\", cyclist and would be Italian, who with his friends is in search of his true identity. Brillant performances from dennis christopher, Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern. Why Paul Dooley didn't win an academy award for his brilliant portrayal of Dave's dad is a mystery. The film did win an academy for best original script. There is justice in the world. While the film received a swag of nominations in other areas. A brilliant rites of passage film that belongs in every classics collection.
0780020685|5.0|Kurosawa is amazing for creating such a movie. The climactic scene in the rain was incredibly moving and the way in which the characters were introduced one by one is unforgettable

B00005JPTA|4.0|Iloved and even own the DVD movie - A History of Violence - another Cronenberg/Viggo Mortensen combination of an utterly terrific cinematic extravaganza. There should have been Oscar nominations there for numerous reasons.    And the same goes for this new film by the same team-up - Eastern Promises.    Viggo Mortensen turns out another - and most probably the most prominent - performances he's done thus far. What an actor! But all the other actors here are truly terrific in their parts as well. Naomi Watts of King Kong plays alongside Viggo with an Oscar worthy performance as a woman filled with bitterness and pain.    The movie has already been told and digested here in this forum, so we won't bother with the movie's storyline. But this wasn't unfortunately not an action-packed movie, but DID have one of the most brutal and most realistic fighting scenes ever developed for film with Viggo going against two mobsters in the Russian bathhouse. Didn't have that staged and chereographed look to it at all.    The ending was too sudden, and unfortunately we felt a bit let down to it. It really needed more of a solid ending here, seeing the destruction and/or decline of the Russian mafia family that Viggo worked for.    But when it comes to plot and storyline, as well as top-of-the-line acting, Eastern Promises delivers in spades. Although, in our humble opinion, overall History of Violence was better.
B000U618C8|5.0|Jose Gonzalez's first album, Veneer, had a quiet, haunting  beauty about it.  Softly sung songs with quietly plucked guitar melodies really made you LISTEN and hear the music.  With In Our Nature, there are more layered, textured songs that sound a little firmer in strength, but that beauty that was housed within the first album transfers here, and the transfer is smooth and complimentary with the enriched melodies.  His sound hasn't changed (You gotta admit, when a talented musician with such a specific sound has a widely received 1st album ,you always wonder if they will stray from what makes them unique on the 2nd album.  He certainly doesn't.)  He adds a few more rhythms, but the simple ingenuity that gave the first album it's strength is still completely at home here.<br />If you liked Veneer, you will not be disappointed with In Our Nature.
B000UFAURI|4.0|This album is very good. It took sometime to get used to, but it is still very good. I felt the lyrics could have been better on certain songs otherwise it would have deserved 5 stars instead. Some of the lyrics were just to repetitive.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Having not bought this item I thought it was great. You may not have heard of Led Zeppelin because they are an obscure rock band from the 70's that now with the re-release of this re-release have released a new set of remixed re-releases that might, for the impoverished group, gain them some of the reputation they justly deserve. These tracks are remastered and remixed from the original remasters and remixed again to give a re-re-mastered quality remix, the likes of which you have never heard before. The packaging, which I haven't seen, is very poorly designed with flimsy card-board and undersized T-Shirt.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Greatest in the case of \\"Fleetwood Mac: Greatest Hits\\" actually epitomizes what a greatest hits album should be all about: ALL hits, no add-ons. This particular CD is thoroughly enjoyable and definitely a must for enthusiasts of true music who, like me, did not purchase their albums when the group was in its prime many years ago. For me, I became a Fleetwood Mac fan after hearing Nikki McKibbin attempt to sing a Stevie Nicks song, Edge of Seventeen, on American Idol a couple of years ago. Nicks was an essential member of Fleetwood Mac and has produced some memorable songs as a solo artist. However, it is Fleetwood Mac - collectively - that has recorded some of the best sounding music ever!!

B00005JPTA|5.0|Just five days short of Christmas, a girl child is born.  As she takes her first breath, midwife Anne (Watts) is calling the time of death of her teenage mother, Tatiana, who bears injection bruises on her slender arms.      Perhaps it's the recent loss of her own child from a former lover, the time of year, or just her character in general, but Anne is deeply touched by the situation and vows to find the baby, who she's named Christina, a family and a decent life instead of institutionalized foster care. So she steps over the line and takes the mother's personal effects--a diary which is written in Russian.     Despite being warned not to dig any deeper by her Uncle Stepan, a recent Russian emigre and former KGB agent (Skolimowski) and her English mother (Sinead Cusack), she goes to the one place where she has a clue in English--a Russian restaurant called the Trans Siberian.      There she meets three men:  Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), an older Russian who appears at first as a strong but benevolent father figure whose Borscht is almost identical to what Anne's own father used to make. Kirill (Cassel) a drunken and somewhat overdramatic heir to the throne and Nikolai (Mortenson) the very dispassionate driver for Kirill, who he's sworn a brotherly allegiance to.     At first, Semyon denies knowing anything about the mother of the deceased young woman, but his interest piques when Anne tells him there's a diary.  He offers to translate the diary and find the child's family for her.  Anne at first demurs, suspecting Semyon is Vory v Zakone (Russian mob) but he's very persuasive and she agrees to return the next night.     Meanwhile, Kirill, the family enforcer and Semyon's only son, has declared war on a rival Chechin gang by killing one of the members who has disparaged his character. The man is dispatched and disposed of with machinelike precision that's almost more frightening than any violence the film  depicts.     Anne's and Kirill's actions set into play a chain ofevents where we witness violence and betrayal at every turn. Throughout the current action, Tatiana's voice (Sarah Labrosse) quietly relates the contents her diary to us, detailing first hope, then rape and prostitution while being forced to take drugs every day.      Director David Cronenberg definitely upped the ante as far as violence and that violence is depicted with a clarity and realism that few films today can match.     While many focus on the violence, what's most interesting about this film is the character study. Mueller-Stahl's depiction of Semyon is the best 'Godfather' I have seen to date and is in my opinion well worth a supporting actor  Oscar. His switch from a loving family man to someone who'd betray a member for another will keep you riveted in your seat.    Both Anne and Nikolai cross the line in different ways and seeing how the two individually act and interact with each other is one of the best parts of the film.  Anne doesn't hold back what she feels while Nikolai plays his cards very close to the vest, but can surprise you too.    Viggo Mortenson, who I will always reign as Aragorn in my mind, was also amazing.  According to the press on \\"Promises\\", he spent weeks in Russia traveling without a translator so he could perfect his Russian and his knowledge of the culture that made Nikolai. The man will always have 'stars' as far as I am concerned.

185984054X|1.0|There is an urge in most of us to find the \\"clay feet\\" of great people. We cannot stand greatness, especially moral greatness, in others. Why? Because it is a reproach to us. It reminds us of what we are not.  Let us just step back and ask ourselves: has Hitchens ever worked among the poor, let alone dedicated his whole life to them? No.  He sits in comfort, aiding neither the poor, nor really anyone else.  Has he invented anything? Come up with a useful theory? Brightened anyone's life in any way? Has he even uncovered truth as a journalist?  No. He is just an angry opinion monger. When he has made even a single life happier, then he will have earned the moral right to judge Mother Teresa.
031286504X|4.0|first, let me say i had this book before i even knew they were making a movie out of it.<br /><br />second, there is no way the movie will ever live up to this book. ever.<br /><br />yes, it's about vampires. but not really. it's more kind of a psychological study about what someone might go thru if they were suddenly the absolute last person on earth (or at least their part of the earth). it has some very dark moments in it.<br /><br />i really don't want to give anything away, but i really, really loved the scientific analysis of vampirism.<br /><br />the main character--the last man on an earth of vampires--does have his freak outs. but he also resolves to keep on living and figure out how to solve the problem of vampires. it is a strangely hopeful position to take, because why bother if you are the last person alive? it really just embodies the human desire to keep living and keep exisiting. i find that desire to be sometimes beautiful and sometimes terrible.<br /><br />the entire novella (i'll get to that bit later) is hopeful. hopeful that he'll suceed. hopeful that he'll outlive the vampires. hopeful that somehow he will find another human being. but then the end just crushes you. and then stomps on your bleeding body. and then throws you over a cliff. truly, it was one of the most heartbreaking endings i have ever read.<br /><br />so. the novella was really great. this edition of [[ASIN:031286504X I Am Legend]]  also included several of his short stories, which were not so great. definitely could not follow \\"i am legend\\".

B000M3452Y|3.0|For those that aren't familiar with LCD Soundsystem, it's another one of those cases where it appears to be a band when really the whole project is done by one person that gives himself a plural-sounding name (kinda like Nine Inch Nails or Five for Fighting). In this case, the brainchild is James Murphy, and although I never got to hear his self-titled 2004 album, I still got my hands on his latest release, Sound of Silver.<br /><br />I don't know whether it's really accurate to call this a full-length album or an EP because there are only nine tracks (although many of them surpass the seven-minute mark). At any rate, the music seems to be a cross of dance and new wave; the latter is especially evident when some songs seem to be influenced by artists of the `80s, like Depeche Mode (the title track) or Erasure (\\"Someone Great\\"). But those songs are still noteworthy, as are \\"Time to Get Away\\" and \\"Get Innocuous!\\"<br /><br />While I couldn't get into \\"Watch the Tapes\\" or especially \\"North American Scum\\" (I'm not offended by the latter, but it just doesn't do anything for me), James still put together an above-average album. True, LCD Soundsystem's music isn't for everyone, but if you're a fan of the genres I mentioned earlier, then you shouldn't mind listening to the sound of silver.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
6305949980|2.0|Too bad this version is not like the one shown on cable. Seems to be an earlier version, and not worth the money. The sellers should be more open about what exactly they're selling when there are different versions. We're not all experts in all films.
B000000HZT|5.0|As other reviewers pointed out, this is an album for the more complex Genesis style that delivered wonderful results up to Genesis' \\"And then there were three\\" and \\"Duke\\".  Tony Banks can not only create wonderful, natural melodies, he is also able of using interesting harmonies and working with his musical material, creating interesting and, compared to most other rock music, rather complex pieces, not the 3.5 minutes industry standard.  The musical material may not be as quickly convincing as \\"Burning rope\\" or \\"Many too many\\" (both Banks songs from \\"And then there were three\\"), but it is high quality material that will grow on you (as so many other reviewers apparently experienced).  On the negative side, I do not find neither the lyrics nor the concept of this concept album very convincing, but the consistent sadness in the music is gripping.  I also do not like some of the arrangements, the sound is often a little too thick and mushy (similar to many \\"and then there were three\\" pieces), but I certainly would not pretend to know how to do it better (more acoustic instruments/orchestra? But then you end up with too much strings and symphonic bombast).  Anyway, considering the exceptional music, it is well worth more attention and 5 stars.  Too bad that Banks did not really feel encouraged to further write and develop this kind of music (he sounded quite frustrated about the lack of success of his solo projects in a recent TV interview).

B000O599ZS|1.0|Except for the scenery this outdated film and story is almost a waste of time to watch.
0790729628|5.0|I can't think of any other truly perfect film that was given a very different directors' cut years later and is still just as good.<br /><br />I believe this is in fact the first director's cut of any movie to be released. The original Harrison Ford voice-over is missing, which really dulls some of the great film noir-of-the-future vibe that makes this so special. What is better, however, is that now we hear much more of Vangelis' fabulous score, gorgeous music which resonates so well with the sublime images that Scott crafted so splendidly.<br /><br />I first saw this the weekend it opened; the theatre was hushed in awe throughout, and everyone applauded at the end. It has only improved with age. Neon-lit wet streets filled with shadowy underworld denizens of our crowded future, endless detail in every frame, imagination spilling from every scene; this film is made to be seen over and over. It's a magic spell that takes you to a unique place in your brain.<br /><br />I think Philip K. Dick would approve heartily of this treatment of his story; Electric Sheep is a typically fine Dick work, but it is even more fully turned out here, and with so much feeling.<br /><br />Above all, this film has heart, and makes you feel, not a typical science fiction accolade. Ford couldn't be better, and Rutger Hauer almost steals the show. It's one of those rare films that spills over with x-factor, and every supporting performance rings true.<br /><br />I will NEVER grow tired of watching this every year, and am really looking forward to seeing the old version again when this is rereleased in the new, somewhat overkill 5-dvd version. It's cash-in time for Ridley! Still, he deserves it. You know a movie is classic when you can get away with that.<br /><br />Blade Runner is filmmaking at its apex.
B000NA28I4|3.0|Personally, I am not surprised at all of the hoopla surrounding this movie. There was a lot of hoopla when the book was published. Why so many people insist on comparing this book to Lord of the Rings is beyond me. Yes, it borrows heavily from all of the standard fantasy world-building techniques. Yes it falters in places. However there are many books that have done these same things and not been skewered in the court of public opinion.<br /><br />That being said about the book, it appears that the same thing is now being said about the movie. Yes, it changed some things from the book. Yes, it left out some character development. Unless you're Peter Jackson with an unlimited budget and the ability to create your own special effects company, that's the way it works in the real world. Saphira is magnificent. The visual scenery is stunning. As for the actors, Eragon is a little wet behind the ears still, but he is quite believable in the role. I thought that Arya was well acted and I enjoyed Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich as opposed to a couple of rather rabid reviewers.<br /><br />All in all, this was a good film. My 8 year old daughter was entranced from the beginning and it even held my 3 year olds attention for the last half. I'm glad that I took the chance that I would feel differently than the other reviewers. No, it's not Lord of the Rings, but then it wasn't trying to be.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|To the reviewer who said that we're supposed to review the product and not the movie...    I thought the reviewers here were SUPPOSED to review the movie, but I'll try my best to review the product.    The product is probably comparable to the previous movie.  Printing done in USA or Canada, and the actual disc duplication probably done in some foreign country, taking hundreds or thousands of jobs away from Americans (but what other company in the business of making movies can put \\"Made in the USA\\" on their labels?)    Assuming the bonus material is going to be like the first movie, I'm going to be happy.  I give this product 5 stars to combat your 1 star that you gave it :-P
0735619670|5.0|This book is quite simply a must read for anyone in the programming field.  The chapter on debugging is worth its weight in gold.  My copy is riddled with sticky notes marking key topics.  McConnell's writing style is entertaining and very educational; he says what he needs to say and doesn't bore you along the way.  There is really no other way to put it: if you must buy one programming book this is it, at least until the third edition comes out.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|Compared to Superjoint Ritual, the guitars are lower and slower and there's not screaming.<br /><br />If I didn't know better when listening to the CD, I would say its a new Pantera album. The music, the singing, everything feels like Pantera. The main difference between the music of Pantera and Down is that Down repeats their music quite a bit more, and that the entire CD is slower.<br /><br />I don't say this CD feels like Pantera because I have a \\"longing\\" for a new Pantera CD, I actually like Superjoint Ritual more. But this CD is defiantly comparable to Pantera and for that I'm thankful.

B000RJO578|1.0|My wife would be the first to tell you that it doesn't take much to make me laugh at a movie. Well, now I've found the cure-all. Slap this bugger of a movie into the DVD player, and I'll be yawning not laughing.  This movie was a pile of rubbish. No laughs to be found anywhere. Now, I understand that its supposed to be British comedy, but British funny is defined as Monty Python. This couldn't hold a candle to that type of humor.

B00005JPRF|1.0|This is no way near as good as the first two movies.  This was a big disappointment.  First of all, movies where there are just desert and sand really turn me off.  They're boring and not much to look at.  The zombies were very cheesey.  No where near being scary as they were in the first two.  They don't look like zombies when they run around quickly, nimbly and attack with accuracy.  And the main \\"boss\\" of the movie was supposed to give fans what they want in a Resident Evil fell FLAT!!  I don't want to spoil it for you, but you'll see.  No where near what the games produced.  The problem of the movie was the pace and the story.  Somewhere between the Road Warrior (Which was a better post-apocalyptic movie then this one) and Day of the Dead.  If you are familar with the original \\"Day of the Dead\\" you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />I recommend you NOT pay the 10.00 admission ticket to see this movie.  Instead wait until you can see it on cable, or rent it from the library for 3.00.  That's if you are a fan of the series & games.<br /><br />That's it.

B00013RC8O|5.0|The 1970s may have been the dark ages of the automobile (think Pinto, Gremlin, American Motors) and of politics (Vietnam, Watergate, Nixon, Carter).  But the films from this decade include several cinematic nuggets that include this little gem, \\"Vanishing Point\\".  To watch \\"Vanishing Point\\" is to instantly time travel to the far-off Nixonian lands of America circa 1970 and 1971.  A free-wheeling, different America than the buttoned-down, anti-septic country we know and love today.  This film is a vast expanse of azure blue skies penetrated by our protagonist and his revved-up white car.  As we watch this film, we are delivered several unforgettable cinematic treats, including the nude hippie chick on the motorcycle, the blind Malcolm X-like \\"Super Soul\\" who guides our protagonist Kowalski through strange ESP powers, the evil denizens of the highway who try to do harm to our unlikely Johnny Cash-like hero, and the race against time to a destination of nowhere that so typifies the dystopic nature of films of this period.  Watching \\"Vanishing Point\\" will be the cinematic equivalent of pulling out that Fondue pot, breaking out the LP records, and dusting off the Parcheesi game for a night of 1970s fun.  Resistance IS futile!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|My husband and I are huge movie buffs, and realized that we did not have 1 alien movie.  I am so glad that we purchased the Quadrilogy.  This box set came with bonus disks for each of the alien movies with alternate beginnings and endings for I think all of the movies!  It was awesome!  I would definetly reccommend this box set.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I have two daughters (5 & 7) and they love the movie, love the characters and can't stop watching both HSM 1 and 2.  For very conservative parents (I kind of consider myself on the conservative side), this isn't all that bad.  They do kiss in this one, at the end.  Other than that, I can't say there is anything else in the movie that requires explanation to the kids (not that I needed to say anything about \\"the kiss\\").  It is actually good, clean fun, unlike many of the other videos that come out nowadays..
B000021Y7X|5.0|I first saw Stop Making Sense as a college student at the Blue Mouse theater in Salt Lake City in 1985 with my future wife.  There are scenes in the movie that have somehow been burned into my long-term memory.  Seeing David Byrne and crew totally lose themselves in the performance moment was a total revelation to me.     The DVD certainly brings this all back.  Byrne is mesmerizing.  The backup band is totally on track.  The backup singers have way too much fun.      I introduced my high-school aged kids to the movie via this DVD and it captured them too.    This is a must have for your DVD library.
B000U618C8|5.0|..though short in its duration, it serves the pieces well in thier simplicity, sonically there is more softness in its ambience as his voice gently imbues into the instrumentation,  unlike veneer where the lyrics and vocals were in the forefront and his strumming was aggresive,here the soundscape sweeps more poetic and meditative in its nature..upon first listening... I must say he delivers yet another gem
1592289444|3.0|I would have admired this book without reservation if it were represented as a work of fiction, but since its supposed to be a true story, I can't be as positive.  Even without the information about the author uncovered by the BBC, which pretty much ends the debate regarding the veracity of this account, I would have questioned the authenticity of this story anyway.      I can believe most of the horrible things described about the author's arrest, interrogation, transport, and incarceration in a work camp (though the forced march seems less plausible, but we should never underestimate the cruelty of the gulag camp system). If anything, the way he describes the work camps sounds too tame in light of what we know about the gulag. He describes a work camp without criminals (most gulag inmates were classed as criminals, not politicals) and with very relaxed boundaries between the commandant and the inmates. This sounds more like Hogan's Stalag 13 than a real gulag. (read Anne Applebaum's remarkable book on the gulag.)    What seems most implausible to me is the novelistic quality of the book. First, there are the supporting characters - in true hollywood fashion, each of whom has a characteristic that distinguishes him or her from the others - toothless guy, the gentle giant, the wisecracker, and most implausibly, a beautiful young escapee who miraculously crosses their path amid the vast wastes of Siberia. Next, there's the dialogue (always recalled by the author verbatim), which reads more like a hollywood script than actual conversation between people (e.g., each of the wisecracker's quips is recalled verbatim). Finally, there's level of detail that no memory could recall, such as who found what kind of snake on which day.      Read this book side by side with real stories of survival, accounts of undisputed veracity (omit those written by journalists or authors who kept a notebook during their travels). Next to a book like Herzog's Annapurna or Worsley's book on the Endurance, the Long Walk reads like a very good novel, but not a true account of survival.      Frankly, I'm surprised that so many people have accepted its authenticity over the last several decades. Credit should go to the journalist who wrote the book with the help of the \\"author.\\" The true story I would like to read is how a journalist and a Polish camp survivor cooked up this tale and sold it to the public. The author's tells us that he donated his time to good causes. I have to wonder if he was trying to ease his sense of guilt or rationalize his long involvement in this hoax.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I wasn't really expecting too much from this cd, was hoping it would be a nice chill out CD for nights, as I've only heard samples and never anything fully from Sigur R&oacute;s, and samples are just that, and you know how samples go, lol.<br />  Well I went ahead and played it once through, and was simply amazed by it. Kind of like an opera for the mind, just absolutely wonderful. Not one bad track, and they all flowed together in perfect harmony. Since then, I've been playin it non stop.<br />  Great for meditation, great for drivin, great for exploring, and just down right great to listen to. I have about 400 or 500 CD's, from all genders, and this one rates right up there in my top 10.<br />  Again, this is a piece of art, wonderfully, craftily and beautifully put together. It's not too soft, not too hard, balanced in every way. What type of music it is? Simply put, \\"Music for the Soul, Mind & Body.\\"
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Within minutes of the first episode you will be hooked.  Dexter has a devilish charm that will appeal to even the most banal viewer.  The highs and lows of a civilized world are portrayed with a beautiful sadness.  the DVDs themselves are basic.  They get the job done by not focusing on a lot of extras, but what you really want to see -- THE SHOW!

0553378384|5.0|By far the best book I own on astrology.  Jan Spiller's ability to clearly articulate and define the personality traits associated with one's North Node is fascinating.  A chart given in the beginning of the book helps determine where your North Node is, which is helpful in looking up the nodes of others.  This is the meat of astrology put into language that is easy to understand.  Jan provides an outline based on our nodal position of what our gifts and struggles are, and how to gain balance with our difficult patterns.  I found it to be very telling and extremely helpful.  This information is not generalized, but incredibly specific and accurate.
B000TERLEK|5.0|Watching the Coldplay: Live 2003 DVD has me questioning critics who said this band was for &#34;moony high school girls.&#34; Do these critics understand the appeal of a band connecting with the heart of an audience or understand what &#34;women&#34; want to hear?<br /><br />&#34;Let me in, unlock the door.<br />I've never felt this way before.&#34;<br /><br />'Til Kingdom Come - the lyrics are insightful and emotionally honest.

Their appeal is definitely their passion, the intense feelings in the music and the soul connection.<br /><br />At times Coldplay does seem to be channeling Sting, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Freedy Johnston, U2 and elements of Kraftwerk.

1592242863|4.0|I rate this four stars for the binding, not the contents which should be five stars.  For a much greater price one can get a finer binding, but if one wishes to read or review the 1859 edition that Darwin rushed into print in order to prevent another putting essentially the same theory forward ahead of him, this is the book.  There were a number of additional editions printed during Darwin's lifetime, reflecting later thoughts, but to see his thinking as of 1859, this is a good, and relatively scarce book to own. The copy I received from Amazon does not contain an Introductory essay.  The binding appears to be perfect bound, and is a hardback.  Contents: 5 stars, Binding: 4 stars
0736063684|4.0|I was recommended this book by an acquaintance on the Bodybuilding.com. After using the book, for my own personal workouts it has helped me to know how the exercises are to be done correctly with the smallest chance for injury. This is a great book and worth the money. The artwork on the various muscle groups and associated exercises is very detailed and colorful. However I would suggest additions to the book if there were a 3rd edition:  - Having an index section for finding certain exercises or prominently mentioned muscle groups on certain pages throughout the book.   - Mention that the barbell triceps extension exercise is aka the skullcrusher.  - Have included a poster size version of the muscular skeleton. I know the book cover already has the pictures, but I'd prefer something I could hang on the wall.  - If possible, the book in an electronic format like a PDF file on CD.  These are just some of my personal suggestions. If you want to buy the book, please go right ahead. It is simple, detailed, and informative.
B000O178BY|3.0|The confounding image on the front cover of \\"Year Zero\\" is one thing, but peeling off the cellophane and unfolding the inner sleeves is another. Yeah, another album of \\"Bible in one hand, semi-automatic weapon in the other.\\" Another album of the sledgehammer connotations between religion and warfare, politicians and lies, and Trent Reznor and his laptop. If \\"With Teeth\\" was NIN at their most rock-out accessible, then \\"Year Zero\\" is a return to the difficult and conceptual. The year 2004 found fellow industrialists Skinny Puppy, Ministry, and KMFDM putting their own spin on the American situation with much creativity and vigor. Three years later, Reznor's interest is admirable yet alienating, coming at a time when the current administration is in its death throes. And the political aspect of things does not lend itself all that well to the three-minute pop songs Reznor is producing here (with an emphasis on repetitious beats that sound spun from a computer program); while there is a narrative flow to the things, most of the tracks tend to blend into one another without a lot of distinction. I will, however, make note of 'God Given'--a wonderfully danceable track with a funky beat and the most bitingly satirical lyrics Reznor has ever written...it's 4 minutes of musical genius that makes the rest of \\"Year Zero\\" tolerable.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is amazing!  The colors are brilliant and the quality is excellent!  We are enjoying watching with our family.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|This is one of the only bands that started hard and they will end hard!!<br />With little to no air play on radio, Slayer has proven they are one of the hardest metal bands in the industry.<br />When other bands have gone more commercial Slayer has stayed true to their roots.<br />My rating for this CD is a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000001EL3|5.0|Production wizard Bob Ezrin really helped the band create a studio masterpiece with this album.  Not as powerful as \\"Alive\\", but still a trippy, diverse and heavy KISS album with rockers, ballads and sonic effects that make it almost like a concept album (check the intro tale of the ill-fated concert goer).  The album has classic tunes and a great \\"sound\\".  Best cuts: God of Thunder (heavy, scary Gene Simmons mammoth) and Detroit Rock City (an anthem).
B000A3DFZE|3.0|I found this CD @ a sidewalk sale for $2 recently.  It is not the greatest set by Clapton, with much of the songwriting routine.  A couple tracks stand out which are quite good.  Clapton's \\"Revolution\\" is an excellent record with Sharon White & Michelle John's backing vocals bouncing off Clapton's reggae beat and making a great track, \\"The time has come & it won't be long; but you just see where you come from, can't go back, can't stay the same with no one but yourself to blame.\\"  This is followed by a George Harrison song \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" that Harrison recorded on his 1979 self-titled album.  Clapton blasts the track with some stunning electric guitar and a committed vocal, \\"There in your heart, something is never changing; Always a part of something that's never aging, That's in your heart.\\"  As a singer, Clapton also turns in an excellent performance on Vince Gill's \\"One Day,\\" \\"Out in the country maybe down by the sea, going to wake up one morning and find that I've been set free.\\"  Many of the other tracks reflect the opener's title, \\"So Tired.\\"  However, look on the bright side and add the few gems here to your song rotation.  Enjoy!
B000UO338W|2.0|5 minutes and 30 seconds. That is how much time you will spend listening to 'N.W.O.' off Ministry's 1992 sonic outburst, \\"Psalm 69,\\" and it will be 5 minutes and 30 seconds better spent than listening to the whole of Ministry's 'Bush Apocalypse Trilogy.' Understand that I am NOT a fan of Bush or his policies. I am, however, a great fan of Ministry (even \\"With Sympathy\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Spoon\\"), which is why \\"The Last Sucker\\" is such a disappointment. Okay, \\"Houses of the Mole\\" galvanized the anti-Bush sentiment back in '04 and was a great album; after the 'selection' of Bush for a second term, \\"Rio Grande Blood\\" treaded over similar ground, but with more sonic fury (I gave it a pass, in spite of the stale rhetoric); now \\"Sucker\\"--promoted as the final studio outing from Jourgensen and Company--strips away the sonic fury of \\"Rio\\" to deliver an album so obvious and tedious that it invokes Anti-Flag more than the crunch-and-grind of Ministry. Whereas the band--even at their most ideologically driven--managed innovative lyrics to accompany music that was similarly original, \\"Sucker\\" is sledgehammer obvious at best (the references to \\"greed, power, corruption, and Halliburton\\" in 'No Glory') and eye-rollingly dumb at worst (note the Aerosmith parody on 'The Dick Song'); at this point, the correlation between power, corruption, religion, and war has been done to death by dozens (if not hundreds) of musicians, and the outcome here is really no more powerful or effective than it was in...well, 'N.W.O.' While the opening track ('Let's Go') is great mosh fodder with irreverent lyrics, the only other inspired note the album hits is in transforming Dubya's oinking laugh into an instrument all its own in 'Death & Destruction.' Otherwise, the most notable songs on \\"Sucker\\" are the 2 hidden remixes that come after the album ends. And the `Bush meets Cthulhu' hologram on the cover is cool, too. But otherwise, \\"The Last Sucker\\" is a disappointing end to an otherwise great musical journey.al journey.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Whenever my wife and I don't know what to watch on a Saturday night, we put on the Eagles DVD and rock away - just like being at a live concert! My wife was never an Eagles fan until she saw this DVD. The only shortcoming is that the entire concert is not on CD!
067101756X|3.0|I was so looking forward to this book, but never made it completely though the book.  There is so much in the book that is not related to the subject.  A lot of background of the author and what he was doing at the time, or what the military or political situation was at the time.  I found it boring.  A male might find it more interesting, because war stuff is a subject they like.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|For those who have grown up reading the Peter Rabbit and friends books so beautifully told and illustrated by Beatrix Potter,  this movie draws us into her Victorian world.  We are enchanted.  Renee Zelwigger's delightful Miss Potter is vulnerable but strong, merry  but dignified and always the proper Victorian lady but determined to have her way.  \\"You and bunnies\\" we exclaim with Ewan McGregor and fall every bit as in love with her as he does.  The homes brimming with gardens and adorned with Christmas glitter and glow open up with the lives of their residents as the tale weaves sorrow and laughter and music from the haunting score into our own hearts.  The animation of the garden creatures within the film is the touch of whimsy of which Miss Potter would approve and, indeed, would be quite\\"adamant\\".  Should I mention the scenery?  I enthuse beyond what even Victorian romantics would approve.  Just buy this DVD, every age will find it charming.
1594489505|5.0|This was an excellent read! Compelling and gripping and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book, and cannot wait to read his first book, \\"The Kite Runner.\\" I was looking for a novel to get completely lost in, and found it!
B000PMGS8G|5.0|This movie is a great throwback from the days of simple special effects.  The stuff imagination was made of and not computer generated. The additional features even have a pilot episode of the original black and white tv show.<br /><br />I give it two thumbs up!
B00005KHEU|2.0|I am amazed by all of the praise this album has received on Amazon.  I chalk that up to the fact that most people don't want to spend time reviewing stuff they dislike, so only fans of this one are posting reviews.  I have been an ELO fan since childhood.  Admittedly, they have always been a guilty pleasure.  I consider Jeff Lynne to be a great musician and songwriter, who proudly wears his influences (primarily the Beatles and Roy Orbison) on his sleeve.      In its way, ELO put a new spin on a familiar sound.  That spin does not always stand the test of time.  Depending on the tune, ELO's music can sound very 70s, which is not always bad, but sometimes it is.  In the case of \\"Discovery,\\" ELO created an album that is a virtual time capsule of 1979.    Even when I first heard the album in 1979 I was shocked by how overly 70s /disco it is.  I could accept (and still do) the cheesy keyboard flourishes of \\"Shine a Little Love,\\" and \\"Confusion.\\"  \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" is a nice rocker, but it is wayyy overproduced (reminds me of Greg Brady listening to his recordings as Johnny Bravo).  \\"The Diary of Horace Wimp,\\" is another example of Jeff Lynn's take on the Beatles and it hints at the ELO classic \\"Mr. Blue Sky.\\"    All of the aforementioned songs are decent, but the rest of the album is filler.  It seems apparent that ELO was resting on its laurels and was running out of fresh ideas with this one.  So much of this album is slow, lumbering and dated it's difficult for me to understand how it is receiving so much praise.  My guess is that a lot of its fans are so accustomed to the sound that their ears no longer hear the 70s disco influence on this one, or they just don't view that as a bad thing.  When the result of the merging of ELO's sound with disco sounds like a lame version of each - it's a bad thing.      It's not an awful album, but it's certainly not one of their best.
0767827902|4.0|If we could only go back in time like the young Cybill Shepherd and Timothy Bottom. It was delightful to experience the highly rated look at the wind swept  Texas town and the end of an era. I plan to watch it again and again.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Oh thank God.  The Bond series has been a sadistic parody of itself for decades, though thankfully, above average instances of parody have typically been followed by a complementary tendency towards seriousness.  Consider Casino Royale to be the restoring pendulum swing of the franchise' most ludricrous logical deviation to date, Die Another Day, a movie that had as much respect for the Bond character as it had for plot, plausibility or ... you get the idea.      Very similarly to the films of the Timothy Dalton era, Casino Royale gives  a no-nonsense, uber serious portrayal of Bond, though its main advantage over the prior is that Casino Royale's use of character development permits the audience to understand WHY Bond behaves so darkly.  As a result, it no longer seems arbitrary.  At the same time, Daniel Craig plays the role brilliantly, making the audience really believe that Bond has a soul.  Though I realize this film is meant as a reboot, I could still very easily see the young, jacked, former-SAS Craig Bond evolve into the slighty more seasoned but still all around thug that was the Connery Bond.    Most interestingly, however, about this movie, is the relationship that develops between Bond and Vesper Lynd, his liason to the Treasury, or something, which may very well comprise the prototype for all of Bond's future relationships with women.  (Ever wonder why he's so fond of but never dates Moneypenny?)  Lynd really is the perfect partner for Bond.  She's dark, just like him, she's calculated, just like him, and in a battle of misdirection and wit, there's no guarantee who would win.  And yet, on top of all that, she is slightly naive, which seems like a charming compliment to Craig's Bond.  Eva Green has been criticized a little for her portrayal but she acts in an interesting, slightly androgynous way, much like her character.  This unusual portrayal potentially reveals elements of the Bond character as well, though regretably, we'll most likely never knowfor sure.  Unfortunately, Fleming never wrote a prequel to Casino Royale.    In summary, Casino Royale is a good leave-your-brain-slightly-on adventure.
0571202284|5.0|I am experienced at drawing but  a beginner with animation. This book is just what I needed,with lots of diagrams demonstrating the tricks required to achieve animation that looks and feels real. Tips vary from facial expressions to human and some animal movement in all its forms. Tips on timing of changes and position to achieve the appearance of weight when the figure lands or fluid movement when it jumps.    I would recommend this book to any one just starting out with animation and even to the experienced animator looking for improvements to techniques.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was so hesitant simply because I couldn't find a good plot summary for it. I decided to see it after reading the rave reviews on amazon. I agree completely with everyone this is THE BEST miniseries in a close tie with Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice (The Colin Firth version),and Wives and Daughters. This is a definite alternative to Jane Austen's miniseries. The only thing I to complain about is that the girl who plays Margaret has moments where she has this blank look on her face. Maybe thats her character, but I didn't get it in places. Fortunately that doesn't take away from the very well done miniseries.
B00000I924|5.0|If you can seperate this CD into the Rock section and Jazz/Blues section, you will enjoy the two worlds better.  Jeff Beck hits all the power notes in THX 138 and Psycho Sam. True ROCK music just got hotter with his guitar playing at its best. But then, Jeff gets cooled off with his blues Brush With The Blues and Another Place.  The melody talents show off his guitar playing again.  I get into bliss when hearing his tunes in Another Place. Anyway, these seem different moods, so personally, I would seperate them into two CDs.  Jeff has some gift - and he should keep on giving it.
1582701709|4.0|The film was great, and the book helps drive it home.  This is such a great book because it's so inspiring yet very simple, so anyone can understand.  It lends itself to being read several times to fully absorb the concepts and makes a wonderful gift!

B000058T5E|5.0|This is classic Jeff beck.  I could listen to this albumn all day long. Roy's Toy and Nadia show off Jeff's great skills at playing the guitar. And Loose Cannon and Rosebud have compelling driving force behind the melody.  This is NOT TRANCE - just great ROCK.  Watch out for Left Hook, because you will get hooked.

B000002UAO|4.0|I had started a Baetles collection as when I was a teen, I had no use for any of the \\"British Invasion\\", as,I was a \\"Honkey-Tonkin\\", \\"Boogie\\" playing Guitarist who played the blusey styled brand of music that made you want to dance all night and we played as we would have played for free, which we often did, and all one had to say, was: \\"Would you guys want to play just a few songs\\"?, so we can hear what you guys do, and all of our stuff was out of the truck and on the lawn, or the patio, as we had to do what we did the best, \\"Blues\\", \\"Steppenwolf\\", \\"C.S.N.&Y\\", \\"Jimi Hendrix Exp.\\", many times over, and it took some time but we found the chords that \\"Jimi\\" used in \\"Purple Haze\\" and in \\"Foxy Lady\\" so we always wanted to rock the house, and we were ready at the drop of a hat (I wore a Derby [Bowler] Hat), striped Hip Huggers, long Tall Boots, and we had us a ball, and we wre hot all over the University parties,and we were paid to have the fun of our lives, but, when the Beatles started to get into their \\"Metal streak\\", then we started to introduce more and more of the Beatles into our lists of songs, like \\"Fool on the Hill\\", \\"Five o' Clock\\"and we took a lot from \\"Sgt.Pepper's\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\", which were more of the adult natures of the bands that we imitated, for they were far from the three-chord stuff of starter-Blues, and the \\"E_A_B\\" songs that repeated the rhythm and just changed some words, while today, I still practice \\"White Rabbit\\" by the Grace Slick & the \\"Jefferson Airplane\\", as I play the lead and the chords on the Bass, and \\"Black-Magic Woman\\" as done by Carlos \\"Santana\\"..real Boss, and the \\"Beatles\\" then started to mean something to us after they got through their earlier stuff, which we just did not get into, and it was just that we got our inspirations from a different avenue, like \\"B.B.

B000R7HY0K|1.0|I love Tarantino, but this was awful. I found myself turning it off to go to the bathroom and kitchen. His usually quirky, interesting dialogue just wasn't there this time. And to top it off, the characters were incredibly annoying. Not a good mix. He already makes the current day equivalent of grindhouse movies. Now, when he tries to recreate those clunky films, he fails. He should've made the same movie in his usual style without trying to imitate the look or try to live in a different time. It's like doing an old musical and trying to make it the way they did then. It just can't work. You can recreate the look, but it has no heart, it's uninspired. It's like Scorsese's \\"New York, New York,\\" it was set in that time, but was a modern movie. Inspiration comes from the gut and Tarantino lives today, not then.
B0000019PA|5.0|Neutral Milk Hotel is a bit of an unfortunate story.  Aeroplane is only their second full length recording.  It is also their last.  Despite strong critical acclaim, singer and guitarist Jeff Magnum left and hasn't done much since.  But before he departed, they made one of the best albums of the 90's.  His vocals and strumming guitar are prevalent throughout.  His voice is pushed forward to be more noticeable in the production, which can be annoying in quieter moments, but overall seems like a positive choice.  His lone guitar is the backbone of a lot of the album, but there's plenty of other sounds to be heard, with lots of crunching noise and horns flaring everywhere to create an effectively haunting yet entertaining atmosphere.  The lyrics also add to this feeling.  He sings about Anne Frank a lot, and his words shift between tender sadness and some disturbing or just odd thoughts.  Overall, Neutral Milk Hotel creates a wholly unique sound with their music.  They can be both very mellow and rock very hard, and the sheer amount of quality there is in less than 40 minutes of music is amazing.    The album starts with \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1\\".  Jeff plays his guitar, singing a nice melody and introducing his bizarre brand of words.  An instrument I can't really identify comes in and changes the tone of the song, really starting to create the album's identity.  Then Pts. 2 & 3 (one track) begin eccentrically before giving you the first taste of their louder, more chaotic side, with a trumpet (probably) keeping it focused.  The title track is another strummed one with weird noises in the background keeping it cohesive in its oddness.  \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" doesn't have those things, and is really just Jeff singing and playing his instrument.  After a very brass-heavy interlude is \\"Holland, 1945\\" a very catchy song despite its subject matter.  \\"Ghost\\" is very up-tempo, with a driving drum line that keeps it going until the massive collision of noise at the end.  Ialways thought I liked bagpipes, but I never knew they could be awesome until I heard the untitled 10th track.  It's an instrumental, but a great one.  The last song is another nice, softer one to wind down from the loudness of the previous tracks.  The flow of the album seems very good, and it all adds up to a great album that's better than the sum of its parts.
B000000W5L|5.0|Oh yeah, I remember 1972! The Rolling Stones were coming to town, and people camped out in line at the Coliseum ticket booth for a week to get tickets (this was before Ticketmaster, the internet or cell phones, and it was the only place to buy tickets). Of course, the tickets sold out in two hours. The Stones were still riding high on the success of their classic albums, Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers, and they had just released their mega-selling greatest hits package, Hot Rocks 1964-1971. They were, undisputably and without a doubt, \\"The World's Greatest Rock n' Roll Band\\". Then they go and release this great double album, Exile On Main Street, and it's a classic, too. Anybody who had the money, bought it, played it and loved it. To this very day, it remains my favorite Stones album.<br /><br />From the wide-open and kicking Rocks Off and Rip This Joint, the bluesy and sensual Shake Your Hips and Stop Breaking Down to the great hit singles Tumbling Dice and Keith Richard's career best, Happy, this classic ROCKS!<br /><br />No, Exile On Main Street isn't polished and spiffy, and some might even say it's primitive or overdone, but I like the authentic and natural sound of the Stones on this one. I can imagine a lot of these songs being played live, in a swampy, smoky and crowded juke joint somewhere down in Mississippi on a hot summer night.<br /><br />This is Keith Richard's finest moment as a guitarist, and Mick Taylor's guitar playing is smoking hot on this one, too. Mick Jagger's voice and harmonica are in top form, and although he's sounded as good as he does here at other times, he's never sounded better.<br /><br /> Exile On Main Street explores many different types of music including blues, country and gospel, and it uses a variety of instrumentation, but the main attraction here is the bluesy, genuine, sensual and shameless rock n' roll. By \\"The World's Greatest Rock n' Roll Band\\", of course.
0684833395|4.0|This book is absolutely hilarious. I didn't expect that I would like it, but I have found it extremely enjoyable. Despite the age of the book, the humor is pretty relevant considering the situation of the world today. This is definitely turning into one of my favorite books.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|The Departed is a must see film.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  It is what I would consider an ultra-violent film, but in a surrealistic way.  Keep in mind it IS a Scorsese film, but in my opinion one of his all time best.  However, as with most mob movies, if you dislike seeing people shot, are very sensitive to violence, etc., stay away.  There is one gratuitous sex scene in the middle of the movie that it could do without, but other than that it is \\"just violence\\" and language that earned it its R rating.  This is not a family friendly movie, but it IS a phenomenal film.    The extras in the two-disc set are nice, but more targeted at Scorsese fans, than general fans of the movie.  There are some deleted scenes which are interesting, and a documentary length item on Scorsese as a filmmaker, among other things.  In general it is worth the extra money, and especially so if you are into films seriously.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is the expanded edition of the movie based on what might be the best sci-fi series ever produced -- Firefly. If only there were more...    If you ended up here, chances are you either know how great a series tis was, or someone you know is trying to let you in on the secret. Get this DVD; it's excellent. Then head over and get the DVDs for Firefly; you won't be disappointed. They really did create something special in the series and in this movie.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  It will keep you guessing to the very end, and you may even inadvertently learn something!  (but not to worry, not at the cost of action, drama, or effects)    The extras on the bonus disk are well done, informative, and worth the extra cost, in my opinion.  The documentary about real Blood diamonds was a particularly nice touch, since it addresses many of the questions that watching the movie may bring up.  As always, it would have been nice to see more outtakes, and discussions with the actors, but overall it was very satisfying.
0553588486|3.0|I feel dishonest only giving this book 3 Stars because the truth is I could not put it down and there is no doubt in my mind that I will end up reading this entire series. I enjoyed the complexity of the plots, the character development, the multiple perspectives, the detailed worlds, the unconventional blur between good/evil and the unpredictable plot twists. There is much in this book to enjoy and praise.<br /><br />That said I only gave this book 3 stars because it left me feeling, well, kind of disturbed. Multiple times, during the course of reading this book, I told whoever was around that I felt like I was being emotionally abused by the author. I usually like disturbing/dark stories but something about this one troubled me. For starters the sex and sexual violence in this book was a bit much for me. Almost all the sex scenes are about a thirteen year old child. The sexual acts that happen to Dany in this novel constitute at least a dozen felonies in any civilized society. Not only could I not discern a reason the author had to make Dany SO young (especially if he wanted her character to be highly sexualized) but the aspects of sex he chose to discribe and the manner in which he discribed them were random, weird and came across as nothing more than a perverted indulgence. I would read something and simultaneously roll my eyes while feeling an icky shudder up and down my spine. I have no problems with sex in books I read, but the manner in which the sex scenes were written in this book are not reflective of real life and left me feeling grossed out. They felt exploitive I guess because they were so gratutious and strange.<br /><br />Also, as a women, the constant rape and violence towards women was hard to read. I realize rape and misogyny are part of the world, particularly in times of war, but the amount and detail was hard to stomach. While the male characters (good and bad) generally die or get injured bravely in battle the women must be systemically humiliated before dying unceremoniously. Not only is raping them bad enough, they must be gang raped. And just in case gang rape wasn't degrading enough they have to be gang raped from behind. This combined with the constant womanizing of the main characters, the constant put downs related to the worth of women relative to men and after a while it makes you start to wonder; has Martin created a world filled with systemic female degradation because he is laying the foundation for an ultimate commentary on oppression, violence and human dignity? Or has he created a world filled with female degradation because that is what he likes writing about? I have 6 more books to read before I can answer that question but I have a suspicion it is the latter which is where the icky feeling I have towards this book comes from. Hopefully, it turns out I am wrong.<br /><br />Even though this book left a bad taste in my mouth in some respects, I will continue to read the series because it is wildly entertaining.

B000OVLBGC|3.0|This movie received raves and cheers when it was in the theater. I can't help but think that maybe they were applauding its sentiments rather than the actual film, for I found it a bit dreary and uninvolving. Much like life in Communist Germany. Bureaucratic terror makes ofr bad film, and though we see the care and concern that went into Communist rule, it is dull. Mona Charen wrote, \\"Quick: try to think of a single movie about the horrors of Stalinism. This is not a failure of imagination. This is moral meltdown.\\" Here's one, Mona, for this movie documents the horrors of post-Stalin East Germany with a beauty that is doubly effective. If you've seen films like The Decalogue, you've witnessed the shoddy Communist architecture, the lack of supplies in the shops, the quiet terror that governed normal life, the grubby and shabby and second rate that covered every aspect of life. But the protagonists of \\"The Lives of Others\\" aren't lacking in material things. The apartments are charming, the liquor seems to flow freely, the jazz is well-played, and no one looks hungry or cold or weary. What they lack are the all the little things that make life free, and without freedom, the spit and polish is meaningless. Even those successfully clawing their way up the bureaucratic ladder, which is the only one that matters, live in fear that one misjudgment will have them standing against a wall.<br /><br />Yet our hero, who learns to defy the system and stand up for right, is remarkably ineffectual. I was never surprised by his actions, and when he finally defies his superiors, sacrificing his career to do so, though we applaud his heroism, we do it politely, not wildly. The man he saves is not much either, and the conflicted girlfriend becomes mere plot fodder.<br /><br />The extras are the same old \\"how much this meant\\" and \\"how hard we worked\\" and \\"how perceptive, yet humble, we are\\" with the self-effacing chuckle to provide verisimilitude. The deleted scenes were well chosen; unnecessarily reinforcing the cold sterility of the protagonist's life. All in all, not a bad film, but after the awards and acclamations, I was expecting more.inforcing the cold sterility of the protagonist's life.

The fact is I feel that :)    First chapter is a bit... following chapters start to go into the topic with advise that really help out for beginner. We may have heard but we tend to forget; we may have looked how the pro does but we tend to overlook.    I give 4 stars in beginner's point of view.
B000UFAURI|5.0|The Foo Fighters have always been at the very top of the alternative rock scene as one of the most inovative. Thanks to now legenday Dave Grohl, this band has been filling our ears with powerful rock songs for over a decade. With their sixth studio release the Foo Fighters have reached new level. The twelve tracks have a sound at least I haven't heard from this band. They have more of a haunting feeling that leaves you in chills once the album is over. The music ranges from loud electric to very meloncholly acoustic. This is also the first time I have heard Dave Grohl scream alot since their grammy winning 'Colour & Shape.' This is truly a remarkable cd and it is definitely going to get alot of credit maybe even a grammy nomination. This cd pretty much lands Foo Fighters as a staple band in the history of music from the late 90s and with each new release it brings them closer and closer to the rock & roll hall of fame.
1577314808|5.0|I was reading \\"I am that\\" by NisargaDatta Maharaj and was thinking about and trying to grasp, what he says - about just being the \\"witness\\" and at the right moment, one of my dear friend handed this over to me.  This book explains it. I dont claim that I am realized after reading this, but now I am confident I am on the right path towards the goal.    This is truely a transformational book. This is the practical guide to understand the mysteries behind teachings of great Masters. My approach towards looking at my life, rather towards every moment of my daily routine, is changed. It started answering my questions right from the first page and now I can apply this principle and answer many questions I have been having about stuff like \\"Why would creating music be transcendental\\" - 'why does one feel so passionate about his/her job and get satisfaction out of it'. 'why do people become instant heroes in emergency situations' - The answer - 'power of now.'  Read it and apply it in your daily routine and I am sure happiness (the inner one of course) and peace would be yours to keep.  Enjoy.   I would recommend \\"I am that\\" - a collection of talks of Shri. Nisargadatta Maharaj, along with this book. You will have no more questions in your life about why things are the way they are.    Wish you the best for your quest.
032147404X|5.0|I was almost thrown off by a couple of bad reviews here.  I'm glad I decided to give it a look.  I received this book this evening once I got off work, and by the end of the night my confidence as an amateur photographer has taken leaps and bounds.  There are so many great tips and tricks in here for the amateur photographer that you'll be itching to get out and shoot some subjects using your newfound knowledge.      Yes, the jokes at the beginning of the book are lame, but they accomplish what the author sets out to do with them: build a friendly rapport with the reader and get the sense that you're getting camera tips from a trusted buddy.  If you're already a pro, you probably have no business buying this book, except to hand it to your friends who are asking you for tips.    This book is a can't fail launching-off point for any budding photographer who might not yet understand exposure theory, but wants to hit the ground running.  I intend to use it as a primer for each outing until I get so comfortable with the material that I no longer need it.      My first stop this weekend:  The Oregon Coast in Seaside, Oregon!    Thanks for the great book, Scott!  I feel like my trip will have some measurable purpose now, and I won't be just aimlessly shooting.
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's THE SHOCK DOCTRINE is a stunning indictment of American corporatism and institutionalized globalization, on a par with such groundbreaking works as Harrington's THE OTHER AMERICA and Chomsky's HEGEMONY OR SURVIVAL. Comprehensive in its breadth and remarkable for its well-researched depth, Klein's book is a highly readable but disturbing look at how the neoliberal economic tenets of Milton Friedman have been implemented across the world over the last thirty-plus years.    The author's thesis is simply stated: that neoliberal economic programs have repeatedly been implemented without the consent of the governed by creating and/or taking advantage of various forms of national shock therapy. Ms. Klein asserts that in country after country, Friedman and his Chicago School followers have foisted their tripartite economic prescription - privatization, deregulation, and cutbacks in social welfare spending - on an unsuspecting populace through decidedly non-democratic means. In the early years, the primary vehicle was dictatorial military force and accompanying fear of arrest, torture, disappearance, or death. Over time, new organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank were employed instead, using or creating impossible debt burdens to force governments to accept privatization of state-owned industries and services, complete removal of trade barriers and tariffs, forced acceptance of private foreign investment, and widespread layoffs. In more recent years, terrroism and its response as well as natural disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis have wiped clean enough of the slate to impose these Friedmanite policies on people too shocked and focused on recovering to realize what was happening until it was too late.    According to Ms. Klein's thesis, these revolutionary economic programs were the \\"medicine\\" deemed necessary by neoliberal, anti-Keynesian economists to bring underdeveloped countries into the global trading community.  Ms. Klein argues her case inconvincing detail a long chronological line of historical cases. Each chapter in her book surveys one such situation, from Chile under Pinochet and Argentina under military junta through Nicaragua and Honduras, Bolivia under Goni, post-apartheid South Africa, post-Solidarity Poland, Russia under Yeltsin, China since Tiananmen, reconstruction of Iraq after the U.S. invasion, Sri Lanka after the tsunami, Israel after 9/11, and New Orleans post-Katrina. Along the way, she lets various neoliberal economists and Chicago School practitioners speak for themselves - we hear their \\"shock therapy\\" views in their own words. As just one example, this arrogant and self-righteous proclamation from the late Professor Friedman: \\"Only a crisis - actual or perceived - producs real change...our basic function, to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\\"     What the author makes inescapably clear is that the world economic order has been largely remade in Milton Friedman's image in the last few decades by adopting programs that would never have been democratically accepted by the common people. Military coups, violence and force, wars, induced hyperinflation, terrorism, preemptive war, climate disasters - these have been the disruptive vehicles that allowed such drastic economic packages to be imposed. Nearly always, they are developed in secrecy and implemented too rapidly for citizens to respond. The end results, as Ms.Klein again makes clear, are massive (and too often, continuing) unemployment, large price increases for essential goods, closing of factories, enormous increases in people living in poverty, explosive concentration of wealth among a small elite, and extraordinary opportunity for rapacious capitalism from American and European corporations.     Ms. Klein argues that from its humble beginnings as an economic philosophy, the neoliberal program has evolved (or perhaps devolved) into a form of corporatism. Particularly in America, government under mostly Republican adminstrations has hollowed itself out, using private sector contractors for nearly every conceivable task. Companies ranging from Lockheed and Halliburton to ChoicePoint, Blackwater, CH2M Hill, and DynCorp exist almost entirely to secure lucrative government contracts to perform work formerly done by government. They now operate in a world the author describes as \\"disaster capitalism,\\" waiting and salivating over the profits to be made in the next slate-wiping war or disaster, regardless of the human cost. In an ominous closing discussion, Ms. Klein describes the privatization of government in wealthy Atlanta suburbs, a further step in self-serving and preemptive corporatism guaranteed to hollow out whatever is left of major American cities if it becomes a widespread practice.     THE SHOCK DOCTRINE is truly a head-shaking read. One can only marvel at the imperiousness of past (mostly) American governmental behavior, the grievous callousness of it all, the massive human despair and suffering created for no other reason than economic imperialism, and the nauseating greed of (mostly Republican) politicians, former political operatives, and corporate executives who prey like pack wolves on people's powerlessness and insecurity. Reading this book, one can no longer ask the question, \\"Why do they hate us?\\" The answer is obvious, and no amount of hyperventilation from Rush Limbaugh, Lou Dobbs, or Fox News can erase the facts and consequences of behavior that we as a country have implicitly or explicitly endorsed.     THE SHOCK DOCTRINE proves itself as shaming of modern American governmental policy as Dee Brown's epic of 19th Century America, BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE. It is an essential read for intelligent citizens who want to understand the roots of globalization and its blowback effects on our lives.
0312330871|5.0|This story by Agatha Christie is very, very suspenseful.  It is also creepy.  It does not have a detective, which seemed strange at first, because I am used to following Poirot and Miss Marple as they solve the crimes.  I did not really like any of the characters but I was still surprised when each one was killed.  When one of the murders took place, pretty much any one of the survivors could have been the killer.  Also, you get to read what each of the characters are thinking; the story is not just from one character's viewpoint.  Is the killer one of the ten guests on the island, or is there a hidden person?  The ending really got me.  Of course, you finally end up with only two characters and one of them turns out to be the killer, but he doesn't stop there!  You'll have to read the story yourself to find out what happens at the very end.  (this review is by M.Charette)
4770030096|4.0|How to learn Japanese: First, get a book and master the Hiragana and Katakana syllabary. This is a must and it shouldn't take you more than a month to do that. Japanese for Busy People has a Kana workbook and that works very well with this first volume since it includes vocabulary from chapters 1 through 10. That way, by the time you immerse yourself with this book, you can start focusing more on sentence patterns. Once you've familiarized yourself with the Kana syllabary, work through the activities in this book. It will give you a solid foundation on two things - mastery of the kana (since everything is written in kana), and basic sentence patterns.  If you still have the time, get a kanji book and start working on the first few hundred kanji. I highly recommend Basic Kanji Book. This way, you can correlate the kana spellings of the new vocabulary words with the actual kanji. However, your focus should be more on the correct kana spelling. I always get confused with the long vowel sounds.<br /><br />About this book: real excellent introduction to Japanese vocabulary, culture, and grammar. The exercises can be repetitive and are mostly substitution exercises. However, this is a great way to master the sentence patterns. My suggestion is to do the exercises and then to create one or two other sentences of your own based on what you just did. This way, you can further apply what you have just learned.<br /><br />Once you're done with this book, skip volumes II & III. Move on to either the Genki series or Minna no Nihongo series, although I'm somewhat partial to the Minna no Nihongo series because it's more comprehensive albeit more expensive. It covers reading, writing, listening, and composition. At the same time, keep chipping away at the 1945 Joyo Kanji. In time, you will have mastered enough Nihongo to either pass the JLPT or order your favorite sushi.<br /><br />Follow Up: It's been about a year since I worked through this book. I take back what I said about skipping volumes II & III. I think it's complements well with either Genki or Minna no Nihongo in terms of supplementing your vocabulary with more current terms.I think it's complements well with either Genki or Minna no Nihongo in terms of supplementing your vocabulary with more current terms.

By far, the best interpretation of a Shakespearean play on film and the first (and likely last) full-text film of Hamlet. The intro by Kenneth Branagh gives props to the multi-year, on-line campaign by fans of this film to get it out on DVD and the running commentary is informative without being invasive/distracting. The cast, the set, and the direction/editing are all flawless. If Laurence Olivier were alive today, he would have re-made Hamlet just like this. Thank goodness for Kenneth Branagh, who had the guts to complete this challenging task so perfectly, in his absence. An absolute classic! Bravo!
1582701709|1.0|I am truly embarrassed that I even read this book, but when something is hyped as much as this book was, I thought maybe there was something in it worth checking out.  Like every other person in this world, I want to be in on the secret to happiness, success, health and wealth; however, one of the (many) issues I have with this book is that what she's talking about is not a secret.  Everyone from the Dalai Lama to Mary Poppins has known that positive thinking is more helpful than negative thinking, but you can't just will money, health, wealth and happiness into your life by virtue of thinking positively about it.  People who have success, health and wealth have worked hard for these things.  Most of these people didn't just sit down and think positive thoughts, and \\"POOF\\" they were rich, successful, thin, etc.  They had a goal, and they worked towards it, without giving up or letting anything get in their way- they were DETERMINED!  You will even see this in the anecdotal stories of people in the book who say 'The Secret' has worked for them.  If you really look, you'll see it was determination that helped these people succeed at their goals- not just positive thinking.  Additionally, I believe there are two things that negate the credibility of this author and her work.  One is the assertion that if you want to be thin, don't look at fat people; the other implies that the victims of the Holocaust somehow brought it on themselves.  Now what kind of inane drivel is that?!  Are people really so desperate and lazy that they will buy into this kind of hogwash as an answer to their problems?  The bottom line is this:  Yes, positive thinking can actually be beneficial as you try to achieve your goals, but so is a lot of hard work and determination.  So if you're truly looking for a secret in all of this, take the word- DETERMINATION- that seems to be what people are lacking more than positive thinking.  Use determination as your defining word for future success; I guarantee it will help immensely...and that's no secret...tee it will help immensely...and that's no secret...
B000R7HY0K|2.0|The fact that this film was all dialog didn't bother me. Hell, I loved \\"My Dinner with André\\".     The problem was that the talk just wasn't interesting.    I'm a Kurt Russell fan and mostly a Tarantino fan, but this film was dull except for the ten minutes following the \\"wrong turn\\" in the first half.    The second half never approached the intensity of those 10 min, so there was no payoff for me for enduring the interminable yap, yap, yapping of the first two-thirds of the second half.     Zoe Bell was charismatic and appealing, but even together with Russell, who's great as usual (I did like his interpretation of the character when the chips were down; nice touch), they couldn't overcome the intrinsic dullness of the script.     This flick had maybe 30 min of good material. The rest had me yawning and reaching for the FF button.
0143038419|3.0|'Eat, Pray, Love...' was a book I liked and disliked at the same time. On the one hand, it was fresh, witty and fun, and on the other hand it would devolve into obsessive ruminations about Liz Gilbert's failed marriage, her attempt to find God and her sadness and perceived \\"misery\\". It was at once clever and boring, hot and cold, cathartic and self-indulgent.  It's not a horrible read (closer to 3-1/2 starts), it's just that over the course of the book, the incessant whining takes its toll.<br /><br />The book begins with Liz Gilbert questioning her marriage. She ultimately leaves her husband, finds a boyfriend, gets rid of him too and thus starts the quest for God and the meaning of \\"her\\" life. She does this by eating her way through Italy, praying and meditating in India, and hanging out and making whoopee in Bali. Initially I loved her insight and wit. I found myself actually laughing out loud at her intuitive commentary; but then I found myself getting bored (and frankly irritated) at her droning on and on about being so sad and devastated, and the pain she was in, and the heartache, and sorrow and misery, ad nauseam. I was waiting for her to describe something truly miserable, heart-breaking or tragic that had happened in her life, but all I found was a woman who went through a couple of failed relationships and acts like she's the only one in the world who's been through it. I kept thinking, good grief, get over yourself girl! I mean, really, the majority of women who go through divorces (or worse) pick themselves up and move on without self-indulgent self-reflection for a week, nonetheless a whole year! Most of the women I know have no time for self-pity, and Liz Gilbert was \\"The Queen\\" of self-pity (at least in this book). It started out funny, witty and insightful in Italy, crescendoing to a full-bore whine in India, and ending with her usual self-absorbed persona in Bali. She goes through life as a Drama Queen, and she seems to see every misstep or unpleasant experience as totally devastating. I think a person who grew up in an intact, two-parent home, married once to a husband who loved and provided for her (and who has been able to promptly find replacements for him), in addition to always seeming to be able to get what she needs when she needs it, whether it's food, travel, love, or money, is not someone who needs to be writing a book about her perceived sorrow and misery. She needs to give many, many thanks, stop obsessing, and MOVE ON!rience as totally devastating.

B000TGCR38|5.0|4 of 4 people found the following review helpful:       Mata Hari and Greta Garbo move over; Rachel Stein a.k.a. Ellis de Vries is the new girl in town, and she is positively fearless!    Paul Verhoeven, whose American film making career gave us such films as BASIC INSTINCT and ROBO COP, has returned to his native Netherlands to co-write and direct his \\"piece de resistance\\" (literally!) in his exhilarating and relentlessly thrilling BLACK BOOK.In BLACK BOOK Verhoeven has created a Resistance fighter/spy/seductive vixen heroine for the ages in Rachel Stein.She is a one-of-a-kind, and Dutch actress Carice van Houten probably has made her most important career choice in portraying her.    Though The film begins on a Kibbutz in 1956 Israel where we meet a song singing teacher named Rachel Stein who chances upon an old friend from the War days,a former Nazi whore named Ronnie, Rachel's memory quickly takes us from the peaceful kibbutz back to the horrors of WW2 in 1944 Holland.This is where the story of Rachel Stein really begins.    As a Jewish woman in Holland, Rachel Stein has been forced into hiding with a Dutch family in order to fly under the radar of the terror of the Nazi Occupation and the compliant Dutch Police. When the family's farm is bombed ,Rachel is forced by circumstance to begin a long line of improvisations to simply stay alive.She is gorgeous,incredibly resourceful and absolutely and unapologetically opportunistic as she,instead of waiting out the War in seclusion, boldly goes forth right under the noses of the Nazis,changing her persona to Ellis de Vries,a platinum-blonde former Berlin cabaret star ,relying on her incredible female powers,beauty (and she is!) genius and courage and takes the Nazi Terror on.Ellis finds her niche with the Dutch resistance which asks her to land smack into the arms of a head Gestapo officer,Ludwig Muntze,(Sebastian Koch).She becomes the Resistance's chief spy as she plays whore to a Muntze,who falls heartily and hard for the magnificent and charming Ellis.What was simply a spy job,though,now changes drastically as Ellis and Ludwig really do fall in love.This is where the final and most difficult task lies for Ellis (and that is all this reviewer is giving away!)    Carice van Houten is an absolute rare find and no doubt the job that she so admirably does in infusing Rachel/Ellis with such depth,complexity and grit will land her all kinds of accolades and awards in the year to come.Ms van Houten takes the courageous yet fleeing Jewess Rachel and transfigures her into the ever resourceful,luminesque-Garbolike Ellis taking her into the world of roller coaster nightmares that leaves the viewer positively out of breath (and I was!)    Sebastian Koch,fresh from his sucess in the 2006 Foreign Oscar winner THE LIVES OF OTHERS is even MORE convincing as Gestapo officer Muntze in BLACK BOOK.This is an actor of such depth that coupled with van Houten and a flawless script and deft direction, BLACK BOOK is going to be hard to top for the 2007 Oscar.With such a glut of overused and underachieved American \\"stars\\",van Houten and Koch are actors' actors and hopefully will keep making smart decisions to act only the finest material under the best direction.Watching these actors makes one wonder why Americans fawn over some of the \\"fluff\\" stars we do?    What is neat about BLACK BOOK is that Verhoeven never gives the audience one minute of rest.He, though, never allows BLACK BOOK to become just another action-packed spy thriller; instead he gives us an incredibly deep and detailed story,set among the darkest days in war torn Europe that is character-rich,plot-exploding with great visual sense and style.BLACK BOOK is Verhoeven at his most mature.His last Dutch film,the 1983 thriller THE FOURTH MAN,though alright,followed by his American films,puts BLACK BOOK at the top of his distinguished directorial list.    Anne Dudley,who heretofore was known to this reviewer for her classical-style music,HYMNS ANCIENT AND MODERN, has composed a compelling and riveting soundtrack that never overtakes any of the story,but cleverly moves the action along-the chief goal of a score writer.    It is hard to believe that this film was 2 and 1/2 hours long! It flew by.BLACK BOOK is rated R and contains nudity,violence and coarse profanity.    Great companion films on WW2 Netherlands would be THE HIDING PLACE and A DAY IN OCTOBER .It seems to me that THE NAZI OFFICER'S WIFE ,which is the true story of Edith Hahn's transfiguration from hiding Jewess into a Officer's wife may well have been the \\"true events\\" that inspired the screenplay for BLACK BOOK.The similarities are uncanny making BLACK BOOK all the better for it.DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!  Sebastian Koch followed up this film with THE LIVES OF OTHERS-another triumph!
