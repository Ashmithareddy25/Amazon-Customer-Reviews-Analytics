0316017922|4.0|I just read the book, Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell. I enjoy Gladwell's style: clear, rational, thorough. He presents research and anecdotes that drill down to connect dots that reveal significant patterns. I am impressed with his ability to present complex information in such a clear manner. He now owns that brand.<br /><br />This his third such book, after \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink,\\" in which he attempts to alter our entrenched perceptions. This time, he works to disclose the conditions and factors that actually enable success.<br /><br />Mapping Success:<br />For instance, Gladwell outlines how persistence and practice (at least 10,000 hours, to be precise) lead to achieving mastery; he examines how culture impacts communication (mitigating language) and action through reviewing airline crashes to prove his point; indeed, he details how culture impacts most everything through a sophisticated presentation of three of the four Hofstede's quadrants. I studied Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions in business school (it measures uncertainty avoidance/ambiguity, power distance, and individual/collective, as well a masculine/feminine cultures) and wish it had been applied in as relevant a manner as Gladwell does.<br /><br />Gladwell also connects seemingly unrelated topics and practices such as how cultivating rice paddies shapes the worldview of certain Asian cultures, which effects their learning, math scores, and general learning. He even reveals how we leverage birth dates and birth years to effect circumstances. Almost nothing escapes Gladwell's net. His approach is thorough, and evidence is overwhelming. By the end, it is clear that anyone who is an outlier, or an extraordinary success, really does owe much of that success to many factors, if they are willing to examine their circumstances. Indeed, if realized, the truly successful would be most humble.<br /><br />What Makes Self-made:<br />Overall, the book is a good read and reveals important factors that can be duplicated to create important successes - unless we simply wish to adhere to the \\"Self-made, up-by-bootstraps\\" myths. According to Gladwell, few people are self-made. Most simply have not recognized or acknowledged all that's been given them.<br /><br />My only criticism - really more an observation - deals with what I see as an incomplete account of success factors. He examines every factor, from individual to cultural, but fails to account for why some people leverage opportunity, while others with the same circumstances, do not. Talent accounts for some of it, but what about other innate qualities.<br /><br />If Gladwell weren't so damn scientific, he'd follow his data beyond the empirical, where gratitude and connectedness reign. Also missing from his analysis is any notion or nod to philosophy. But these examinations might take him down a rabbit's hole. Gladwell is on a mission: to measure, prove and observe. Anything else might be dismissed as self-help. In that spirit, Gladwell disproves many myth's, while setting out to map success - even if the bulk of his research is retread and not too terribly original. Gladwell reserves his creativity for the unique way he connects and applies material. On this point, he succeeds!<br /><br />Still, I look forward to his continual exploration. What I learn from Gladwell is worth far more that ten-times the price of each of his books.cesses - unless we simply wish to adhere to the \\"Self-made, up-by-bootstraps\\" myths.

031606792X|4.0|Well I ordered new and it got here quick but it had some damage to the paper cover and a bend on the cardboard backing. Nothing bad or distracting but still, could have been better. I believe it might have been the tight packing that damaged the paper cover but idk about the bent part.

B001MW0J2O|3.0|The experimental song structures are appealing and refreshing.  As is the middle ground Animal Collective expertly treads between electronica and rock.  But the chanting, sometimes sophomoric lyrics, with a total, although stylish disregard for melody, is hard to digest.  Those who relish the now, will appreciate the creative output of Animal Collective.  But those with a larger world, i.e. music, view will, in the end, wonder what all the buzz is about.  To put things in perspective, see Lennon's Give Peace a Chance -- he did it without a laptop.
B000QFAJ7S|2.0|Well...  This album wasn't very good with about two exceptions.  1. Never again  2. One minute    Kelly Clarkson is/was one of my favorite artists.  She slipped greatly with this album.  All of the songs she was mad and screaming!    I was very glad to hear \\"my life would suck without you\\", as it seems she has gotten her pop sound back.  I am very much looking forward to All I ever wanted, and hope it will be as good as Breakaway was.
B00008G0YO|4.0|is quite the crooner.The song \\"Never Had No One Ever\\" reminds me of \\"When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely thier only desire is to die.You should know it doesn't make me smile.I wish I could laugh..But that joke isn't funny anymore..It's too close to home and it's too near the bone more than you'll ever know..I've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine..\\" from \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" off of ([[ASIN:B000002L7J Meat Is Murder]].) The joyous \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\" is on here.Morrissey's lyrics about women demote the album a star such as \\"I've lost my faith in womanhood\\" from \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves.\\" ([[ASIN:B000002L5P The Smiths]].) On this album  the offender is \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\"..Buy it it's The Smiths.
159102594X|3.0|The main thing about The Blade Itself isn't so much the setting - which hardly counts as fantasy at all - but the style, which is Pulp Fiction meets Conan.     I enjoyed this one a lot because of that - after all - I loved Pulp Fiction, but I do wonder if any follow-up novels will lose their shine if all the bleak violence is lumped on again?     Too much of any strong sauce will put you off a meal in the end.

B001KMB6VE|1.0|About 45 minutes into it I was thinking that people were wrong and this seemed to be a great movie. Suddenly, without warning... Someone decided to go crazy on me and spliced up scenes that make zero sense, an out-of-control story line and... was that romance they were trying? Where did THAT come from?    This looks like a picture where the Director didn't have a clear path to an end, ran outta money and couldn't film the transitions between scenes he'd already shot. The result is a great first half followed by something that'll make you wonder if you drink was spiked. Also out of place are some great effects in the first half, then something that resembles 1969 effects in the later half. So bad you won't know to whether to laugh, or cringe and feel sorry for someone.    Can't recommend buying, but if you get the chance to see it for free it's worth watching just for the historical aspect of how a good movie idea turns stupid in the wrong hands.
B001543L92|3.0|If you were waiting for that amazing glossy picture sleeve, with high quality front/back cover printing, high quality band's photos...don't buy it, and wait more 30 years for the next reissue, because Metallica did with this one just what they did with their music after And Justice For All...they screwed up
B000OVLBEO|1.0|Obviously I watched a completely different movie then these moron's giving this trash anything more then a star. I feel cheated and pissed off I have to even rate this as a 1 star. This movie was without a doubt one of the worst movies ive seen in quite some time. I knew when Nicholas Cage was cast it was going to be stupid, but even I didnt think he could do this bad!! Nicholas Cage sucks as an actor anyway but this movie was well past god awful.       The acting was terrible, the stupid lines were the worst ive seen, \\"Have Mercy, Sorry All Out Of Moercy\\" WHAT THE FU** kind of stupid shi* is that. That alone made me want to turn it off, but I thought it cant get worse then that, Yeah well It does! This movie has some of the gayest lines you will ever hear in any movie. If you have a lick of sense, take my word and dont waste your time on this dud!      NEGATIVE 10 STARS
B0017WCG48|4.0|For the collector type of customer, I would like to say that if you were waiting for that glossy, bright, wonderful cover this album comes with the plain one. And the quality of the band's photos is terrible for somehing that should be the finest of the finest. Will we have to wait some 30 years more :-) ?
B000001F5A|3.0|As good as Chariots of Fire? Not even close.<br /><br />COF has a number of absolutely classic haunting melodies. Antarctica has not even one. I am a big fan of Vangelis' best works and I don't think this is one of them. It might be a fine accompaniment to film of endless ice floes and vast white wilderness but on its own, removed from those images, it does very little for me.<br /><br />My mind wants melody as well as grand harmonic washes, and while Van can present both, as on COF and Blade Runner and a number of other masterpieces, I find this soundtrack to be pleasant listening but nowhere near the rhapsodic experience that others here claim. They are welcome to their opinion as I am to mine, which is that this is in the lower half of Vangelis' canon.<br /><br />If you are considering buying this cd, I would wait until you've got COF, BR, and maybe another six of Van's best works. This music is wonderful background stuff, but it's not the transportational event that much of Van's best work is. I'm also not a big fan of those 80s synthesized handclaps, and they appear a little too often here.<br /><br />All in all, a nice atmospheric cd but hardly epic, and far from Vangelis' finest.
0525951113|5.0|For a gripping account of our perilous future, look no further. Daemon combines the best aspects of Tom Clancy and Neal Stephenson without the weaknesses of either. I cannot recommend this novel enough to people interested in how technology could change the fabric of society.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Springsteen is enjoying some kind of Renaissance of sorts.  His last 3 albums with the E Street Band have all been \\"top drawer\\" material: THE RISING, MAGIC (my personal favorite), and WORKING ON A DREAM.  He hasn't had a string of accomplished work since the '70s with BORN TO RUN, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, and THE RIVER.  Although I prefer the raw edge and hard rock sound of MAGIC, I feel WOAD is much more consistent.  Everything from the songwriting, singing, playing the instruments, and producing are all in sync on this album.  If I had to compare it to one of Springsteen's earlier albums, I would say THE RIVER.  It has that country rock sound to it.  Highly recommend.
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Bought for my husband and he loves the bowling ball.  A good buy for the Lebowski fan.
B000M53GM2|3.0|Perhaps the best part of this 130-minute film is the first 10.5 minutes. It's so spectacular that the rest of the film almost becomes a letdown.    When I first saw this a dozen years ago, I thought that opening action scene, contained the most outrageous stunt I had seen to that point in film. It had James Bond falling off a cliff and catching up in mid-flight to a falling airplane, landing in the cockpit and righting the plane!  It was, of course, ridiculous, but great fun to watch.    The rest of the film is more typical Bond silliness with far less spectacular scenes. When it comes to gadgets, sexual innuendos, unrealistic action with Bond escaping from impossible situations, lots of pretty women and exotic scenery to ogle, these James Bond films always give plenty of the above. Sad to say, in this film, the dialog is much dumber than usual and the fake Russian accents are hard to decipher which is very annoying.    One good point: there is almost no profanity in this film, even minor stuff....but overall, it's just a \\"fair\\" Bond flick. decent but nothing to write home about, except to note that it was Pierce Brosnan's debut as Bond and h proved to be fine in that role.
0312383320|3.0|First, for most other writers this book would get more stars. But this is Evanovich and her loyal fans know what she's capable of.  The book was funny, the light read I expected and wanted, but I was disappointed with the ending.  It's like Janet hit her contracted word count and just stopped.  I can't point to anything in particular that was unresolved, but I was left with a flat feeling.    I think Janet's publishers are working her too hard. Let up on her, guys!
B000A0GXGA|5.0|This video reminded me why  Maverick was such a fun series. I wondered if the screenwriter for \\"The Sting\\" was influenced by the first episode. The quality of the restoration was great. It was not like many of the old series that are hard to watch because of sound and visual  clarity. My only problem now is that I want more episodes!!!
0143038583|5.0|I had no idea our food industry operated this way. I thought farms operated as they did when I was growing up. The farmer planted multiple crops and raised multiple animals, and it was a synergistic compatability. Now I see an industry that is contributing to the ill health of us all, and we walk the path blindly.  Read this book!
B00007KWHG|5.0|A five star collection of songs bythe first group I knew by name!  Every song is a classic - if you have not seen \\"The Jersey Boys\\" you should do so as it places all the music into the context of their lives.
B001PBSDCA|5.0|[[ASIN:B001PBSDCA Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence.

B001TCNSOI|3.0|This was an ok movie, with some nicely acted scenes, but for the life of me, I cannot understand why Angelina Jolie got this part. I was totally distracted by her unnaturally puffy lips and blood red lipstick.     And in the scene where she grabbed and yelled at a convicted psycopath, (which would never be allowed in real life), she looked like the creature from Alien, with her grotesque mouth and salivating teeth. I fully expected the little projectile with the baby teeth to come out of her mouth and spear the killer. I actually laughed out loud at that.     I really hope that she will not win best actress for this role.
B001JNNE64|5.0|My previous viewing of Amadeus was in a college classroom presented on VHS format on a large NTSC tube television. In that sitting the film came across as best it could I suppose, I saw a bit of the genius in Shaffer's screenplay, however it was less than grand and at times very difficult to hear the actors clearly (not to mention a muffled soundtrack). Looking for older movies on Blu I was excited to hear about this film. I knew it had the potential to be an excellent example of why Blu-Ray matters and I'm very happy Warner Bros gave this package treatment worthy of 5 stars.    Given the right equipment, a Blu-Ray viewing of Amadeus is incredible. The Doulby TrueHD lossless audio is excellent and the 1080p picture quality almost as good. Considering the lack of quality, properly calibrated displays in theaters when this film was released in the mid 80's; as with many classics released on Blu-Ray, a home theater viewing will be like the first time seeing this film for many.     The Blu-Ray book package contains the Directors Cut of the film along with many bonus features on the first disc. It also contains a digital copy of the movie on a DVD (data) disc which is copy-protected Windows Media format standard definition, lastly it contains an audio CD containing some of Mozart's most memorable pieces of music.    Some films deserve nothing less than the best quality audio and video possible and this is one of those movies. If you're even a casual fan of classical music this is one purchase you will not regret.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|okay, so in this movie, anakin is a MASTER correct?  but Ventress is still alive.... so how come in vol. 1, he kills ventress but there is no mention of asoka and he has the PADAWAN hairstyle, and also C-3PO has his gold suit in clone wars.  but in vol. 2 it shows him  3PO getting re-done, plating wise. so in case i missed something in clone wars, asoka should still be alive.    someone should explane this to me please and thank-you
B0013N3DSE|5.0|For its time, and even today, this is an adventure film that has it all. Although dated, the BR transfer is outstanding - both audio and video.  The arrow hits and flying sound effects are clear as a bell. Korngold's outstanding score has new life and is vibrant. Warner Brothers is to be commended for the love and care taken to bring this film classic back to a new generation - and us old fogies who saw the original feature when it came out appreciate it also - even more now with the great digital transfer and its clarity for the eye and ear.
B000067FP8|4.0|When this came out, it was an amazing movie because these Gremlin creatures looked so lifelike. They still look pretty real. What I like best about this film is that it took the hard edge off the first one and made it more of a comedy. To me, this sequel was more entertaining than the first film and one I would watch a lot more times. It's also family-friendly.    There are so many jokes and wild scenes in here it would many viewings to catch them all. For movie buffs, it's especially fun with all the references to other films in here.    However, it should be pointed out that there are still plenty of scenes where the gremlins are nasty and attack people, so the film is still horror-like in that respect. It may be played for comedic purposes, but these creatures are anything but friendly. In other words, there is still a bit of a hard edge in here for people who want that.    Phoebe Cates and Zach Galligan reprise their roles as the cute, small-town, wholesome (despite not being married, however) couple who live together who, of course, know all about these gremlins.    It was nice to see Jackie Joseph (of the original \\"Little Shop Of Horrors\\") again as well as some other well-known characters such as Christopher Lee, Robert Prosky, Dick Miller and Keye Luke.    The film just flies by, which tells you it's entertaining.
1593082010|5.0|The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice.  It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner. This is the ultimate original chick lit.  Beautifully written, young, whimsical, and provocative.  Will remain one of my all time favorites!
B00005U8EM|4.0|Although I haven't watched this in awhile, I found it a very nice lighthearted romance/comedy that got better with each of the three times I viewed it.  I may check this out a fourth time, now that it's out on Blu-Ray.    The main role is perfect for Bill Murray, who is good at the playing a likable rogue, a guy always full of baloney but you don't seem to mind. The transformation of his personality is fun to watch in this film and gives it a sweet ending that was popular with audiences.    You would think a movie with this plot - the same day reoccurring day after day - would grow thin in a hurry but it doesn't. The screenwriters and actors all made it clever and fun to view each \\"new day.\\"     All the characters from Murray to female lead Andie MacDowell to the supporting actors do a great job of keeping the story fresh. Particularly funny was Stephen Tobolowsky, who portrays a nerdy insurance salesman. I liked Marita Geraghty, too, and it was fun to see Rick Ducommun again, my favorite actor from \\"The 'burbs.\\"    For a modern-day comedy, the language in here is very mild. The only drawback was seeing MacDowell's character compromise her wholesome values at the end.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I am not a big American Idol fan but my husband is.  I liked David Cook's Seattle Sound when I did hear him sing.  And the content on the album is not dealth, killing, etc so if my kids hear his album, it's okay.  I think for a freshman album, David Cook has done well and I feel that he will do well on future albums.
B001GH1ZQE|5.0|Su albúm debut, Frank (editado en 2003) fue nominado a los Premios Mercury Music y ganó un Ivor Novello award en 2004, por su single \\"Stronger than Me\\". En 2006, sacó su segundo album, Back to Black. El 14 de febrero de 2007 ganó un Brit award en la categoría de Mejor Artista Británica.   Heredera de infinidad de sonidos retro, Amy Winehouse no hace sino confirmar el talento, la heterogeneidad de registros y la riqueza sonora que demostrara en su disco debut. Si con 'Frank' sorprendió a propios y extraños y se atiborró de premios y alabanzas, este 'Back To Black' no parece que vaya a cambiar la visión de esta chica.Y es que de tal mezcla inteligente de gospel, soul y jazz sólo puede salir lo que sale, un disco grandioso. Si Christina Aguilera lo hace bien en \\"Back to Basic\\", Amy logro convertirse en una leyenda. Sí, es verdad que Winehouse no inventa nada, pero lo que reinventa lo hace mejor que bien, consiguiendo captar la atención desde los primeros compases de 'Rehab'.   'Back To Black' además supone un paso hacia delante en la senda de un sonido propio y característico del Reino Unido, que antes tenía entre sus principales estandartes a Craig David, Lilly Allen, Corinne Bailey Rae o Mys Dynamite y a la que ahora se une este nuevo talento.Con canciones directas y escritas de su puño y letra a Amy Winehouse sólo le hacía falta una producción cuidada para que el resultado fuera el deseado. Y ahí estaba de nuevo la chispa jazzy de Salaam Remi y el buen conocedor de los sonidos pegadizos Mark Jonson -encargado de la producción de Lily Allen o Christina Aguilera-.   Bajo su tutela productiva la nueva figura del pop británico lleva a su terreno sonidos y cualidades vocales que mucho recuerdan a una Nina Simone y a una Aretha Franklin mezcladas -no agitadas- con Macy Gray y PJ Harvey.\\"Yo no quería hacer más jazz otra vez. Estaba aburrida de las estructuras de acordes complicados y necesitaba algo más directo. He estado escuchando mucha músicade grupos de chicas de los cincuenta y los sesenta. Me gusta la simplicidad de aquella música. Da en la diana.\\" Se puede escuchar en la sutil referencia a las Supremes en \\"Back To Black\\".      Pero su búsqueda se extiende aún más allá. Mientras que los grupos femeninos de los sesenta por los cuales se ha sentido cautivada, contenían sus voces, Amy se libera con el estilo vocal de Aretha en \\"Just Friends\\" o en \\"Rehab\\". \\"Love is a Losing Game\\" es una composición moderna puramente clásica: breve y empapada de emoción. Otros puntos álgidos del disco incluyen la canción inspirada en Nas, \\"Me and Mr Jones\\", la hermosa \\"Wake Up Alone\\", \\"I'm No Good\\", la epifanía personal que nos habla de poder comportarnos tan mal como esos tipos que nos han causado daño y nos han dejado huella, y la cariñosa canción de estilo blues \\"Back To Black\\".
B00005NWLO|2.0|Ok, Skynyrd fans; get out your knives!!! The dirty secret about this band is that they really weren't that great of a live act. Yes, you heard me right! If you add up several factors(1-crappy Peavey amps 2-Exhaustion from too many years of ridiculous touring schedules 3-playing the songs \\"like the record\\" with no room for spontaneity or creativity 4-Artimus Pyle is a weak timekeeper on the drums)and throw in horrible production from Tom Dowd(the most overrated and bad producer of that era; he also ruined Cream),this is the weakest of the Skynyrd albums. The best live recordings are to be found on the Collectibles disc from a '73 radio show. If you must have it, search around for a cheap copy in your favorite used disc store. Me, I'm gonna go put on Nuthin' Fancy (their best) and TURN IT UP...............
B000002GVZ|5.0|Although I owned several of Carly Simon's LP's back when I was a young man, I seldom listened to them with the exception of this (the first) The Best of Carly Simon ( I did however look at the cover to [[ASIN:B000002GXW Playing Possum]]an awful lot). The Amazon Editor's review says it well, \\"This is all meat and no filler\\".<br /><br />Although Ms. Simon was a rich kid whom I would have had little in common, the songs always spoke to me both with her emotive vocals and her amazing lyrics that changed effortlessly from narrative verse \\"My father sits at night with no lights on; His cigarette glows in the dark. The living room is still; I walk by, no remark.\\"  To vivid metaphors \\"You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds, but soon you'll cage me on your shelf\\"<br /><br />\\"That's the way I've always heard it should be\\",  \\"Anticipation\\", \\"I haven't got time for the Pain\\", \\"The Right thing to Do\\" are four of my favorite songs of all time. The `70s was the time I went to High School and spent my early young adult days so maybe I'm not objective, but for me that was about the best time for music of all genres' and that especially includes singer song-writer music and this is among the best of the era. Last year I had an epiphany of sorts, when in the song \\"Anticipation\\" Ms. Simon muses \\"these are the good old days\\" the obvious inference was we should live in the now and not look off to the future. My wife and I concluded that no, what she really meant was the 70s were the good old days.<br /><br />But maybe that's just us!<br /><br />So here's the deal,<br />The newer Best of Carly Simon  \\"Reflections\\" [[ASIN:B0001XANAS Reflections: Carly Simon's Greatest Hits]] has a more career spanning collection, but this budget priced early collection is all good and a great buy.

142312166X|3.0|My girls and I love the Percy Jackson books, and we purchased this one the first day it was released. It contains three short stories, interviews with some of the kids, a map of camp, an illustration of Annabeth's trunk (so that demigod readers will know what to pack), and an excerpt from the next book. The stories ring true to the books, but the interviews are poorly written - they just don't have the right voices for the kids. There are probably eight illustrations, which are lovely and in color, but inaccurate, which very much disappointed us. To check ourselves, we looked back to the first books where the characters' appearances are described. Annabeth has curly hair and grey eyes, but not in the illustration. Chiron is balding with a wispy beard; here he has twice the hair of most men. Of course I could be wrong, but the book looks to me like the author wrote the short stories, and someone else slapped the rest together. Still enjoyable for the Percy Jackson fan, but wait until you can pay half price.
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|It just keeps getting better. This is even better than Underworld(2003). The stunts are awesome. If you liked the first Underworld, you'll love this one. Kate beckinsale sure knows how to fill out that skin tight black outfit. That alone was worth adding this to my collection.
B000T2OMX0|5.0|It's true that these suites have been frequently recorded. But it's with good reason! Bach's work surpasses all others in its capacity to be plumbed, developed and re-imagined and displays unrivaled excellence and elegance on every compositional level. There is so much to be developed and highlighted in these works, a lifetime of performances may only scratch the surface.    It's also true that many have recorded these suites despite having nothing new to say and often possessing less than admirable technical skill, but since Casals they have figured at the heart of the cello repertoire, and every cellist is eager to conquer them. Each suite is difficult in it's own way, and the fifth and sixth suites are rather notorious for their formidable technical hurdles. It's rare to hear an individual who exhibits a true mastery over any given suite, much less the whole set.    Queyras is that rare individual. And not only does he execute the technical demands of these suites with astonishing perfection and grace, but his interpretation brings something totally new to the table. He discusses in the liner notes a sense of phrasing which--respecting the contrapuntal nature of these works--treats melodic lines less like vocal song and more like spoken conversation. He executes them this way, deftly shifting his coloring of each phrase to bring out oft-hidden exchanges between voices to a startling and extremely pleasing effect.    Queyras infuses each suite with an individual character by giving to each one a unique set of timbrel colors. I can't say I've ever encountered such an approach in other recordings, but at the same time, I don't think I've encountered another cellist able to draw so many different types of tone colors. Some of this may be attributed to a unusually rich-sounding cello (it possesses an extremely rich bottom end that literally growls in the scordatura tuning of the fifth suite) along with an exceptionally expressive and controlled bow technique. He evenornaments beautifully!    This is an unusually tremendous set of recordings, both technically and musically. Whether you like his interpretation or not, one cannot argue but that each note has been meticulously considered and that his technical skill is second to none. This is a set that belongs in everyone's library.
B00005JPS8|3.0|My biggest complaint about this movie is that the \\"big showdown battle\\" was between Downey and Bridges and not Downey and Say.....the kind of people who kidnapped him such as Terrorists and other scum of the Earth. I think people have never gotten a sense of \\"payback\\" after 911 and this could have been the perfect film to do just that. Instead it's wasted on two so called Business partners and of course one turns on the other.  The film was fun and enjoyable for the most part, but i regret buying it for my collection.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|In 2027 the Earth is in its final days. A pandemic infertility plague has wiped out any hope of a future generation of offspring. The world has responded by tearing itself to pieces w/ terrorism, war, and a new world disorder. England is the only place left w/ somewhat of a functioning government, and it is a fascistic police state. There is no hope. Or is there? CHILDREN OF MEN is a story of mankind's hope in spite of utter hopelessness. Even in the face of certain extinction. Right in the midst of the murder, desolation, and complete anguish, a young woman carries the (tiny) possibility for man's salvation. As apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers go, CHILDREN is up there w/ 1984 and SOYLENT GREEN. Highly recommended...
B00000ITOY|5.0|This is a great toy - simple, no -frills construction yet very good concept. There are many toys in the market which have the concept of stacking blocks of same shape on one rod but the rods are all the same. This toy encourages development of problem solving skills and even a child as young as 17 months can be explained about how it works and can be expected to carry it out. This toy allows for self correction of errors and promotes concentration as well. It can be used for sorting colors and counting too but the main intention of matching the number of holes to the number of pegs is awesome (though very simple for adults, this is a huge step for children). I have made this analysis based on how my child used the toy. She also loved the shapes, they are easy to hold, manipulate and provide just the right amount of challenge which prompts the child to complete the task out of own will. You can change the challenge levels by using appropriate cues initially and progress to no cues eventually. Great toy. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|it was just SO depressing! I am a big fan of Will Smith and will watch anything he's in-- but if I never have to see this movie again it will be too soon! There is just one sad event after another and really there are no \\"feel good\\" moments at all. I felt like I wanted to hang myself while watching the movie-- not really, but that's just how depressing it was to watch. Props to Will Smith on an amazing performance-- the only good thing about the movie, taking out all other content.    Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie...
0451191153|4.0|Very old book but true to the day on how mas media can make or break (shape) public opinion.
B00005R62K|5.0|I'll keep this short but sweet. Out of all the Judas Priest albums from the 70's, this is the heaviest and fastest. After songs on the previous album Sin After Sin, like Sinner and Dissident Aggressor, it would only make sense to expand on that sound. And it sure does, almost all the way throughout it's heavy, fast, and aggressive. Buy it if you love Judas Priest, or just great speed metal. You won't be dissapointed.
0307455874|5.0|The book is a presentation of politics of real life--of how politics is versus should be. A \\"must read\\" for any one caring to evaluate his leaders with.
B00062ZE44|5.0|this cd is very good. the band is one of the best out there. for people who love true rock music, this is a band you have to hear.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|To call it a B movie it's making it way too much honor..it's more like a Z movie.. extremely poor acting, shallow and incoherent plot, literary cliches and stereotypes in such quantity as to make A-Team look like a sophisticated masterpiece. No wonder a ludicrously simplistic \\"makes you feel well\\" trashy book is behind this embarassing movie. And please, stop abusing the word energy.. we are in the XXI century, almost everyone has has a bit of physics education.. go find some more nebulous concept for your phychobabble...Time ago it was \\"magnetic fluid\\".. now \\"energy\\".. I wonder what comes next in the lousy chain of cheap and easy misleading theories...
B000002V07|5.0|Where was I for the last 15 years. Just found Mazzy Star via music in the film Rails and Ties (which is also very  good). Mazzy Star is superb.
B001GCWR8Y|5.0|This is a great package. I already owned the cd, but this set offers the bonus cd track \\"Hellfire\\" which they performed live when I saw them live in Allentown, PA. This track is also the opening song on the DVD which IS playable in the US IF you have an all-region dvd player. They are inexpensive and can be found on ebay. The concert is very good and the three videos are also \\"thumbs up\\". A one star score is unexcusable due to reviewer's ingnorance...it plainly says \\"PAL Region 2 dvd\\". If you are a fan of Airbourne, do yourself a favor and buy this, you won't be dissappointed.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Excellent recordings, no flaws in the CD, and there are songs I did not remember. It has sound effects as well - I must find a use for them. Not enough of the 5, 6, 7, 8's though, but I'd still buy it.
B0015DWLAS|5.0|As someone else put it, wow.<br /><br />This book is kind of like 2001 A Space Odyssey, as in it trys very hard to convey some really deep message, but unlike that movie for me, this book actually meets that goal.  It really shows how this is an Epic to end all Epics...<br /><br />The first two books prepared me for the conclusion, but only in the sense that I knew it would take a new direction from each of the other two, and based on the nature of the growing conflict, it would be dramatic and unforseen.<br /><br />I really was blown away by the depth and breadth of this story, how it comes to dramatic conclusion, tying up loose ends, and revealing the full glory of the story in all its drama.  Even if you aren't compelled by every element of the story, you will reel with the complexity of it, the way it was carefully constructed and developed throughout the books, etc.  You will feel the emotions of these characters as they each give their all in bravery and valor, standing firm against seemingly insurmountable obstacles.  The title of this book suggest a solitary hero, when in truth there are many.<br /><br />So many times great writers leave us with a predictable ending, and a less than dramatic means to that end.  Sure, you might predict that good will triumph over evil, but this book has enough in it to give you pause, enough to think about, enough to worry about, enough to completely enthrall you that instantly sets this book apart from most others.<br /><br />An extremely satisfying ending.<br /><br />An absolute must read (but of course you might want to read the first two books first :)  An all time great book...
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Malaguena!(SP?). (Confused this with my other review for Kill Bill II). Like the Kill Bill I CD, the Kill Bill II CD is sublime. Also, I tried to find them on iTUNES but could not. This is better though because I have the CD with the case and it could make a nice party gift.
B000E41MRC|5.0|This superb propaganda film is a warning for all generations.  Germany had Hitler, well portrayed as a carnival medicine man, surrounded by puffed up, self-important people like Goering.  Who is to say Huey Long of Louisiana would not have been America's replication had he lived?  Mexico had Pancho Villa, Japan, Tojo.  All countries seem subject to such seduction.  That is why this is such an important film.  We watch Hitler descend from the sky, almost angelic. The eyes of all who see him reflect glory, a new messiah.  The audience swells to a cast of thousands, tens of thousands, and more.  The soft speech evolves to staccato, the pauses in speech become more dramatic.  Yes, \\"Hail Victory,\\" Hail the leader.    Yes, hail the future.  Large crowds of mindless apostates following the ultimate leader's call to \\"One country, one ideal, one leader (fuhrer)\\" could easily happen anywhere.  Even America.    See this and tell all who will listen.  It could happen here.
B000002OTL|4.0|What can I say? The cool music is mixed in with bits of dialogue from the film. People walk into my office thinking I am a square, and then they hear...\\"And I will strike thee down with Furiuos Anger...Bang Bang Bang!\\". Oh well. I had to have the music just so it would not play again and again in my head. I bought this on suggestion from the website when I went to buy Kill Bill. I am glad I did. It makes a great set, and it has different music I would not normally buy. I like to play it in the car so it feels like I am in the movie. The box was new(?), and the CD plays without flaws.
B001AP11LQ|5.0|Before I go any further, I'll just put out there that the White Stripes are hands down my favorite band, so this may be a bit biased. However this is one of the most severely overlooked albums of the last decade. I can't say how many people I've met who love the stripes that haven't heard a single song off of this album. If they only knew what they were missing.    Out of the 6 full length albums they've released so far, this may not be their best, but it's the best representation of who the Stripes really are as a band. Raw, unfiltered, and more talented than they appear to realize. A lot of people rip on Jack White because he doesn't shred on guitar, or the songs have too basic of a structure, but there's more to music than how complicated it is. Jack White's songwriting ability is so far beyond anyone elses in this music scene it's scary, and what makes it work is his ability to make more out of less. He can create so much drama out of just a few earth-shaking chords. Just listen to \\"The Big Three Killed my Baby\\" to hear it.    This is definitely the Stripes most rudimentary album. The production is ridiculously grainy. It was recorded in a warehouse and you can tell. There's many points throughout that you can hear Meg's drums rattling from the sheer volume on Jack's guitar. There are a few points where there's too much or too little distortion, and yet it all comes together very well. The feeling you get from listening to this album is so rare. Songs like Screwdriver still raise hairs on the back of my neck.    The White Stripes are definitely one of those bands you either love or hate. There isn't a lot of in between. There isn't anything on here that will change your mind if you haven't liked any of the other stuff they've put out, but if you like the stripes at all, you need to get this album.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I received the DVD on time.  I really enjoyed it.  I just wish there were comments from the director.  I enjoy hearing the background information and tidbits about the scenes and the actors.
0439023483|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It has many of the hallmarks I look for in a book: engaging characters, interesting plot and most importantly, it makes you think long after you've set the book down.  That said, I would not recommend this book for kids.  The moral/ethical issues raised in this book left me (a 31 year old) thinking and dreaming about the book for several nights.  Obviously, it's a parent's decision what their child should read, but I highly recommend reading it yourself before deciding whether you add it to your child's reading list.  The good news is an adult is very likely to enjoy it.  The premise of characters between the ages of 12 and 18 being forced to fight to death in order to survive is not for the faint of heart.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This was a gift for a 5 year old boy who loves the whole \\"Home Alone\\" series.  It arrived still wrapped (brand new!)when we expected a \\"like new\\" product.  Great!

B001IASHWY|4.0|I liked \\"Hellboy II\\" quite a bit and found it to be surprisingly entertaining.<br /><br />No spoilers from me. The plot follows the continuing adventures of Hellboy as he deals with more supernatural menaces (fairies, elves, and worse), odd friendships, a change in management, and girl troubles.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, the special effects are *VERY* good, and the acting is on par with the first movie. This is a worthy sequel!<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B001GKO45K|5.0|This movie is fantastic and one of the only ones I have found with English Subtitles.  The moral question is...When Art is evil, can it still be great?  The answer is a resounding yes and this movie proves it.    Triumph of the Will chronicles the Nazi's 6th Congress at Nuremburg.  The subject matter, like Olympia, is repugnant but the style and manner in which the film was made are genious.  Riefenstahl employs revolutionary techniques in camera work and lighting and gives the audience a once in a lifetime experience.  This is possibly the greatest example of Historical Propaganda available today.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|Watching the movie Changeling brings one to ask, is there any time the L.A. police department wasn't corrupt?<br /><br />Changeling is the based on a true story about Christine Collins a single mother of a nine year old boy in 1928 Los Angeles. Mrs. Collins goes to work one day and when she returns she finds her son is missing, so she calls the police which starts a series of events and police procedures that are shocking, for instance it was standard procedure to wait 24 hours before the police would file a report on a missing child. The police find the boy five months later, but the boy who is returned isn't her child. Mrs. Collins repeatedly tells the police it isn't her child while they try to convince her it is her child and that she's crazy even going so far as bringing in a doctor to try to assuage her concerns with ridiculous expertise \\"trauma can some times shrink a person.\\" That would come off as lame and laughable if you weren't at the center of the events. Mrs. Collins continues the fight to find her son, and as the events unfold they continue to shock us that police could have the power to substitute a woman's son while trying to convince her it was her son, and think they could get away with it.<br /><br />The acting throughout is strong, it's good to see Angelina Jolie acting again after the walk through stint in Wanted. I can't think of one weak performance in the movie, John Malkovich turns in a subdued performance as a radio preacher trying to expose the corruption of the L.A. Police. As a director Clint Eastwood moves you (emotionally) along with the story, we feel Mrs. Collins' frustration as the police do their best to shut her away, and we feel relief as justice prevails and she's rescued from the fate of being left in an asylum. Eastwood doesn't follow the standard clich&eacute;'s of what you would expect, once you think it's going to be a police procedural he changes direction as seamlessly as switching gears, when you think it may be about serial killer he moves the movie along as easily as the needle of  phonograph onto the next song on the album.<br /><br />The bonus features include two making of documentaries, the first a misnamed feature titled Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie Partners In Crime but it covers all facets of the production except food service, which I found interesting.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has created iconic and memorable characters as an actor but I think he will be more remembered for the movies he's directed; here's hoping there's a lot more coming!the movie along as easily as the needle of  phonograph onto the next song on the album.

B001GZ6QBU|3.0|Christian Bale returns as Batman in the sequal the Dark Knight. Once again he does not fail in bring the goods. He was a talent actor. The same goes to the late Heath Ledger in his Joker. Before the Joker was always a silly villain in previous Batman movies but in this one he is an awsome, twisted villain you can't take your eyes off. The sequal packs a lot action and twists I didn't see coming. Like Batman deciding to save the District Attorney rather then Rachel whom I assume he would. The District Attorney becomes the second villain in the movie as that act and his disfigurement transforms him from the good hearted hero to villain. You can see and understand why he falls from grace which has always been one of my favorite things to watch. The only problem the Dark Knight has though is it drags on and on. When you think its over it contiunes on and on.
B001PPLIEQ|2.0|We all know Casino Royale was a return to form and loved by most people. Everyone I know was excited for Quantum. Almost all were disappointed. Some have written it felt like a coda to Casino, not a film in its own right. The story isn't nearly as good (thank you, Ian Fleming) and the action pieces were all forgettable, though constant, save for the beginning foot chase (minus over-editing).     But I also think the story doesn't really feel like a continuation, at least in any satisfying way. Casino was so compelling because something was actually happening to Bond directly and emotionally (and Craig is awesome). But Quantum's wrong from its inception. Here, we get a `parallel' story: Bond meets up with a woman who's on her own revenge course, a Bolivian whose parents were murdered by a third world General. And the General's tied in with a criminal organization with the main Villian whose not even shown as responsible for Vesper's death. Mr White is the tie with him and he disappears straight away. How much more thrilling it would have been for Bond to go after those directly responsible for her death while showing him as haunted by her memory throughout (not just the sleep inducing plane scene with Mathis). Remember how driven Bond was in Casino? He should have been possessed in this, a mad chase with all the supporting cast shooting off that...    The director's, Marc Forrester, only contribution to Bond will be to help strip away all cheesy-ness and the fonts of the location names as they appear on screen. Otherwise, he's a Tool. Characteristics of his Toolness: His stark visual sense, trying too hard to be cool. Hint: the locations are suppose to be appealing... maybe they could get ugly girls for the next one to really break with formula? The crappy title sequence done by his \\"crew.\\" They say they love the 60s and From Russia with Love, but they made it 70s and nowhere near as good as all the recent title sequences. Coupled with the amateurish title song (derivative, depressing, lame). That opera-thing scene where he went \\"artistic\\" inter-cutting shots instead of staying with Craig, substituting suspense with pretentiousness. The final \\"showdown\\" with that 70s (stark) lair being blown up in pointless and again, yawn, suspense-less fashion.     Great filmmakers would have noticed a few things: the story isn't satisfying. The parallel plot is less compelling, not helped with there being little character development or chemistry between Bond and the leading lady. The action scenes rely on editing instead of suspenseful progression. The Villian's intro at the docks isn't memorable and goes on way too long, cramming in too much story \\"discussion\\" instead of progressive scene development. The boat chase that follows goes nowhere. Mathis' intro has two back to back slow (horribly slow) scenes, which he never recovers from, causing little interest in his unmemorable death scene. The opening titles/song are dreary instead of exhilarating (what Bond films should be from start to finish). And the finale is destructive, but boring. The final scene in Russia is good... coupled with the opening foot chase and the scene with M in the Grand Hotel, you have the best bits of the film... that's it, two years and millions of dollars, and that's all you got.    Producers: Please start with hiring great writers (it's a big world, they're out there!) to come up with a great story and script. Haggis is great with dialogue, so you can keep him for that. Stay with the no cheesy-ness, but keep searching for a great director. Style and substance, not style over substance. And don't take a long time, recover the momentum from Casino!
1400082773|5.0|This book is poignant for understanding  Pres. Obama today.  It is an eye opener on his family life, his world travels, his inner turmoil with race issues, and what drives him today.  Worth your time to read - no fluff in this book!

0618918248|2.0|Perhaps best known for his first book, The Selfish Gene, the eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is also the author of eight other books. In his latest book, The God Delusion , we experience Dawkins as an outspoken atheist and fierce opponent of religion in all its forms. The first message of his book is directed at those unbelievers who are still trapped, like R. Kelly's narrator, in the closet: \\"You can be an atheist who is happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.\\" But Dawkins is not content with mere emancipation from the shackles of belief; he will not rest on his laurels while religion is merely accorded an equal footing with atheism. Dawkins goes so far as to liken the religious education of children with sexual abuse, and calls for the extirpation of religion; he even finds agnosticism to be a \\"poverty\\". For not only is religion nonsensical but, departing drastically from Voltaire and Seneca, it is a pernicious influence which is holding humanity back from the all-but -inevitable progress (with occasional saw-tooth regressions) of the moral Zeitgeist.    That the 20th century, result of this \\"progress\\", was by far the world's bloodiest escapes his attention, as he optimistically states, without proof--blanket and unfounded assertions are par for the course for Richard Dawkins--that \\"there seems to be a steady shifting of standard of what is morally acceptable\\". In short, all religions are bad because 1) the books upon which they are based are stupid; 2) the followers fail to actually follow the books; 3) and even when they do follow them they shouldn't do so because (see 1) the books are stupid; meanwhile, those who have had their \\"consciousness raised\\" by (the prophet) Darwin, the keepers of a completely arbitrary and morally subjective system under the guise of a loosely defined Zeitgeist are more moral. The reason: because Richard Dawkins is oh so smart.    But this is nothing more than what Chesterton, who knew a thing or two aboutatheists, called refusing to \\"submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around.\\" Dawkins reasons that early Americans were unenlightened because they, like the rest of humanity, kept slaves, while modern Americans are more moral because we no longer do. It is telling, though less than surprising, that Dawkins fails to single out the cause of slavery's demise: Christianity. That we practice infanticide and call it abortion is irrelevant to Dawkins, moral parasite that he is. Though it will surely give future atheists reason to gloat when the barbaric practice is finally banned because of the movement of the Zeitgeist. One envisages a future Dawkins character proving that atheists are more moral because we no longer practice abortion like our benighted ancestors.    Parts of his book are good: his tangents related to evolutionary biology are informative, and his warnings about the dangers of fundamentalism, though cliché, merit heeding. But one gets the feeling that Richard Dawkins knows no more about religion than I do about his master subject. He can't see how anyone could believe any of it to be true, and thus pretends that it is not useful. But there are a great many people who have believed it to be true; in fact, atheism is largely a new trend, and if many of the pagans, like Seneca, doubted that their religion was correct, they didn't sneer at those who did believe, and they certainly didn't pretend that it was without utility.    Throughout, Dawkins' tone is condescending and mean-spirited. And while I couldn't care less about what Dawkins thinks of believers--my faith is not that shallow--mocking those who happen to believe in a non-materialistic world is not the best way to win converts--or friends. Even those who are sympathetic with him will conclude that Dawkins is a jerk, and a tactless spokesman for atheism.    But there is another rather large flaw in The God Delusion. Dawkins believes that science has largely answered humanity's questions, questions whose very ambiguity caused our ancestors to regulate them to the realm of theology. To Dawkins, questions that presently remain unanswered will either be answered by later science or deserve no answer. By virtue of his enormous brain, Dawkins knows that those questions which cannot be answered by science, will also be unanswerable by religion. \\"Why are we here?\\" may be more meaningful than \\"Why are unicorns hollow?\\", but both are difficult to answer so--implicitly of course--why bother asking? This fails to account for the possibility of revelation: certain questions are beyond the capacity for human reason to understand, but are attainable since God has, allegedly, deigned to walk among us. But Dawkins knows that this could not have happened because his human reason tells him so. QED.    Now science is not without its uses. Indeed, many religious people practiced science; Albert Magnus--from those poor Middle Ages, which produced Dante and the cathedral of Chartres--springs to mind. Whether we believe the world to be a part of God's creation or simply the result of natural selection applied over a large period of time, or both, science allows us to better understand the natural world around us. But science cannot answer the deep probing questions which have haunted man since the beginning of time. For all of our science, we are no closer to understanding why humans existence than was, say, Gilgamesh. Worse, we seem to forget this, postulating that because Gilgamesh did not have science and technology, we are obviously better off than he was. Maybe. But we still die, and all the science in the world is unable to tell us what it all means.    Contrary to what one might infer from his book, most religious people don't care if Dawkins doesn't share their faith, though many certainly pray for him. The religious individual who reads his book should not be filled with indignation. Instead, the feeling which he will feel first and foremost is thatof pity. At worst, religions are, in the words of the irreligious Fred Reed, \\"gropings toward something people feel but cannot put a finger on, toward something more at the heart of life than the hoped-for raise, trendy restaurants, and the next and grander automobile.\\" Those who cannot even begin to consider that something suffer worse than mere delusion.
B000M2EH32|5.0|I heard his video with Neri Per caso on Youtube, what a fool believes, and that turned me on to him. What an amazing singer, great voice and artistry. A mix of a young Italian Barry White with Sinatra smooth who can do Jazz like an American from Nawlin's, and a man who takes him music seriously. Very tight and high musicianship.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Best indie band out there.  Epic sound that keeps being used for movie trailers, Slumdog Millionaire, the new Disney nature film, some other film I don't remember.  Better than the most melodic Smashing Pumpkins, the piano more emotional than your favorite Coldplay song, greater crescendos than Snow Patrol.
0307269752|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the premise and mystery was very different from anything I had recently read, and liked the two protagonists.  I will say that it has a very weak first few chapters and it was hard to \\"get into.\\"  As I tell my friends, at least read until you meet the actual girl with the dragon tattoo.  I think that is when the book really picks up.  I am very excited to read the next two books by this author.
0740748475|1.0|Mr. Watterson and his publishers are shrewd people. After a couple decades of hammering us with redundant reprint books, the kind that force you to buy every one of them so you can get a more complete collection, they finally publish the complete collection.    But this collection is so shoddy that it is a crime. The materials used are junk, and pages fall out. Don't buy it. Or better yet, go buy all the past reprint books at used prices and you will conserve your money and there will be one less sale for this Andrews McMeel Publishing disaster.    I would think a cartoonist that fought to keep his characters and strip from being licensed to death in other arenas (like toys and coffee mugs) would have more integrity and want to make a first class collection for his fans.
B000JLSLZQ|3.0|This is just a quick review of the Blu-Ray version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".    The picture quality is great, the audio isn't.  The audio on this Blu-Ray is Dolby Digital, which is the lowest quality audio Blu-Ray can use.  This is a MUSICAL people!  The soundtrack is available on high definition SACD! Why is the audio on this BD Dolby Digital???  The audio has about as much life to it as an mp3 file.      If I am expected to pay a premium price for Blu-Ray movies, I expect a premium experience from that movie, and this ain't it.

159102594X|4.0|To my surprise, I enjoyed The Blade Itself, a formulaic yet highly entertaining epic fantasy. Abercrombie seems, to me, the kind of writer who loves fantasy and enjoys tinkering with its elements and tropes. The book offers nothing innovative, but it is one helluva fun ride. Much of the pleasure is derived from Abercrombie's motley cast of antiheroes including Glokta, a tortured torturer; Ninefingers, a jaded barbarian; and Jekal, a dandy handy with a blade. They are all compellingly flawed, and the author never misses a chance to put them through the grinder. Even the supporting characters are interesting, and I for one would love to read a stand-alone adventure featuring Frost and Severard. In this character-driven novel, I can excuse the lack of a clearcut overarching story and the episodic structure. The lack of resolution at the end disappointed me (the novel might as well have ended with, \\"To be continued\\"); however Abercrombie writes with such verve and humor that it is hard to be upset with him. He reminds me of Bernard Cornwell, who compensates for his unoriginality with energetic, action-packed storytelling. The Blade Itself satisfies the itch while you await George RR Martin's next novel. I plan to gobble up the rest of The First Law trilogy within a weekend.
0452289963|3.0|I havent finished reading this book yet, but so far, it seems to me to be a mish mash of old and New Age Wisdom and truth. As far as a new Earth goes, there is really nothing new under the sun. However, that said, I am prepared to read it in full and give it a go.The same old problem always arises with every age, Mans inhumanity to Man, and mankinds seeming inability to forego greed, selfishness,& acquisitiveness , and replace these things with Love, peace, tolerance, forgiveness gentleness, openmindedness, and kindness.Everyone wants Peace and Love, but everyone is looking for an instant pill to make it happen.As I said, the ideas espoused in this book , while worthwhile, are not new, they have been taught by every world religion and prophet since the beginning of recorded time.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This is a great story that keeps fairly close to the storyline of the book (at least for a Hollywood film anyway).
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|It's been a while now since I saw ONCE, but there's been no lessening of impact. I marvel at it still and love it still. I've done the MP3 thing with the songs and have pimped the movie to my friends. Looking at the glowing reviews here, I don't really have much (or, really, anything) to contribute, other than my unreserved support for this fantastic movie. My apologies then for whatever redundancy may follow. Probably you've heard most or all of it before. Still, I'll hang a SPOILERS flag here.<br /><br />Getting somewhat poetic now: Modest in ambition, woeful in budgeting, but lavish in the ways that count, in honesty and heart and sheer musicality, ONCE quite easily measures up to any glossy product put out by Hollywood. ONCE looks unglamorous and at times even amateurish, and seems more real becuase of it. Featuring the blue-collar city of Dublin as seen thru the eyes of its inhabitants, ONCE tells of a tiny increment of time spent together by an Irish busker who repairs vacuum cleaners as his grown-up job and an impoverished young Czech woman who can make a piano sing. Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; in these roles are so natural and pitch perfect that I was startled when I found out how little professional acting they've previously done. I wasn't startled at all, of course, to learn that these two are real life musicians, and very gifted.<br /><br />Some background stuff, garnered mostly from a Glen Hansard interview I read in the Montreal Gazette (published 4.14.07): Director John Carney used to be the bassist for Hansard's real life band The Frames, before Carney moved on to cinema and directing. Originally Carney had only wanted to consult Hansard over Hansard's busking experiences and also to use his songs for ONCE. Actor Cillian Murphy had already signed on to play the lead role, but then he balked at singing the difficult shifts in Hansard's songs and also with working with Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;, who had never acted before. Murphy pulled out, and a gutted Carney was out one leading man. Days later, Hansard asked Carney to play bass at a gig he was performing with Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; (they'd just collaborated on an album), and it was during this time, when Carney was rocking out and seeing how well Glen and Mark&eacute;ta were getting on, that Carney hit on the idea of having Hansard play the lead. Hansard, initially very reluctant, was eventually talked into it. The rest, as they say...<br /><br />Just to underscore how shoestring ONCE's budget was, John Carney had to engage in guerilla filmmaking, declining to pay the permits for street filming. The opening scene was shot with hidden long lenses, so the people on the street had no clue that a film was being made. One fallout to this was that when the scene called for the guy to run off with Hansard's character's guitar case, one unwitting bystander, trying to help out, booted the \\"thief\\" in the nuggets. Heh. In a way, not having bigger budgeting helped to make this a better film. Much of the dialogue is improvised, and there's an intimacy and an organic feel to the story that probably would never have been tapped into if the film had been better financed or cast with a name actor.<br /><br />But amateur shamateur. Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; develop amazing chemistry onscreen. It helps that they know each other in real and that the characters they play harbor real-life connotations, musicians playing musicians. In the credits, these characters are known only as \\"the guy\\" and \\"the girl,\\" but Hansard and Irglov&aacute; breathe life into them and deftly convey the melancholy and the relentless tediousness of their lives. The film premise is this, simply: two sad people finding a connection, creating brilliant music and then parting ways. There's a romance, but it's unrequited and mostly unremarked upon. The girl is married, with a little girl. The guy, suffering from a broken heart, halfway hopes of someday doing big things with his music, but is stuck in a rut. The girl proves to be the motivating push. I think it would've played false if the ending had been different. As it is, what goes on between the two is understated and bittersweet and terribly romantic. There's something so wistful and sad about the girl's last lingering look out the window in that closing scene, as the camera then pans out to the street and the end credits roll.<br /><br />The musical performances are what elevate this film into something truly special. There are tiny, significant moments etched out in this slice of life story, little vignettes full of glancing looks and endearingly awkward conversation and a sense that honest to gosh lives are actually being lived here. But there are at least four absolutely showstopping moments in ONCE, and these happen when Glen Hansard and Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; play their instruments and lift their voices to sing. The guy's savage evening rendition of \\"Say It To Me Now\\" out in the street. The riveting duet of \\"Falling Slowly\\" (my favorite) in the music shop. The girl's late night excursion to the convenience store and her stroll back home as she sings the lyrics she'd just composed to the guy's music (\\"If You Want Me\\"). The guy's makeshift band recording \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" in the studio and the sound engineer getting schooled by the band's performance. All amazing, flawless stuff.<br /><br />DVD bonus features come in the way of what I think is a must-hear film commentary by Glen Hansard, Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute; and Director John Carney; a separate commentary by the same three on six of the songs; \\"making a modern day musical\\" - the Making Of featurette (12.5 minutes long); \\"more guy, more girl\\" - a segment exploring the relationship between the two central characters (9.5 minutes long); a webisode \\"broken hearted hoover fixer sucker guy\\" (basically, this is just some rough sketches set to this song); and the option to download \\"Falling Slowly\\" from the motion picture soundtrack.<br /><br />The key, of course, is that we so personally identify with these working class characters, who everyday struggle and doubt like we do and whose personal triumphs, like ours, are more often than not measured in modest achievements. This movie reaffirms that in the routine and greyness of our days are sometimes concealed shades of color. And that, if nothing else, there is always music.

B000VWE5OY|3.0|Torchwood  This series is no where near as good as Doctor Who despite being a spin off of the show.  They seem too comitted to finding any excuse to drop in as many meaningless sex scenes as possible and neglect to pay attention to the failing plot line.  Every charcter has a ridiculous bisexual scene by the end of the first series and CGI is left wanting in the final episode.  It is a shame as there is so much potential for excellence in this series.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie. One of my favorites. Probably the only movie I've ever seen that I would actually pay to see mutiple times in a theater. Can't wait for a sequel.
0316017922|5.0|This is a book and I'm not a book reviewer but I will say that this book is very interesting and I am about halfway through.  Lots of different examples of what makes a person stand out from the crowd and not what you might think.      Why are hockey players all born in the beginning of the year?  Why is Bill Gates so successful? Is it because they worked so hard to make themselves what they are today? Or are there some other factors at play? This book will tell you the answers.

B00003CWL6|5.0|The title says it all. America's paragon of beauty is a self-absorbed nymphette, or a frustrated matron's petal-deep rose by the same name.<br /><br />Although all the characters in this film are existentially tormented, there is a clear division between those who get it and who don't.<br /><br />The \\"it\\" is our innate separation from the rapture of merely being alive, captured here in a grainy video of a plastic bag blowing in the wind, but commodified for most Americans by a Barbie-doll culture where the culmination of life means being desired, or acquiring what you desire.<br /><br />Mendes is telling us, a little heavy-handedly at times, that being in the 'burbs isn't what blinds you to being truly alive. It's your lack of imagination that will get you in the end.<br /><br />Such is the human condition: At our most comfortable are we most tormented. At least those who \\"get it\\" will perceive the vapidity of America's depraved idea of beauty.
B000002UB6|4.0|At a time when the Beatles were experiencing their height of turmoil, this release was all but left for dead until resurrected and remastered by Phil Spector, with lush strings and choral arrangements.  The opener, \\"Two Of Us\\" features sophisticated acoustic interplay with two part harmonies of Paul and John that take you back to more harmonious times.  \\"Dig a Pony\\" rocks from start to finish, with John's soulful vocals. \\"Across the Universe\\" is another tender acoustic tune that John shines on.  There is some filler from the movie soundtrack (\\"Dig It\\", \\"Maggie May\\"), but George's \\"I, Me, Mine\\" is a caustic tale of the selfishness of the members.  There are the classic hits, including \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", and \\"Get Back\\", which appears in an abbreviated rooftop version.  There is a more rocking version available on rarities, where Paul raves out at the end with the band rocking  behind him.  In all, a classic release none the less.

B000002UAF|5.0|This is a wonderful movie soundtrack, showcasing a series of hits.  From the title track, the hits keep coming. . \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" features the catchy harmonica lick and John's vocals.<br />\\"If I Fell\\" is lovely (listen closely to the end of the song on the remix and you can hear Paul's vocals crack). \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\" features a young George on vocals. \\"And I Love Her\\" begins to demonstrate the sophisticated songwriting to come in future years. \\"Tell Me Why\\" is a joyous pop song, as is \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\".  Worth owning.
0553382179|5.0|I've been a member of the FLYLADY group [...] for several years. The book spoke directly to my secret messy self and provided concrete suggestions in a hot pink book that I can have in one place instead of spread out over a bunch of emails.  Don't get me wrong--I love the emails, but knowing I can just flip to a chapter in the book for a quick checklist is what I needed.  Great book!

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Until last weekend, I'd never seen Groundhog Day. I'd also seen hardly any of it on television. But of course I knew what it was about. The film has its own place in pop culture and is always included in a discussion of great comedy films. Groundhog Day, featuring Bill Murray in his prime, is about Phil Connors, a cocky arrogant weatherman, that travels to watch the yearly ritual of the groundhog, his shadow, and the coming of spring. Phil brings along his photographer, Larry (Chris Elliot), and his producer Rita (Andie McDowell). They are both subject to Phil's selfish actions throughout the day.<br /><br />Then, Phil wakes up to the same music as the day before. He soon realizes everything is the same. He is reliving Groundhog Day again. By now, even if you've never seen the movie, you know what the plot is. Yet, you are in for a great surprise. Phil relives Groundhog Day hundreds of times, and each time, Rita, Larry and the townspeople are living the day as if it is their first.<br /><br />Phil goes through several stages, from cynical amusement at the prospects of living the day over, to using his knowledge to take advantage of strangers, to total despair at the prospects of stuck in the endless loop of time. Eventually, Phil changes in a heartwarming way and the movie ends happily.<br /><br />This kind of movie would never be made today. Its pace is slow and deliberate, yet full of laughs. It isn't raunchy and doesn't try to get away with stuff. The movie treats the viewers with respect. It never explains why Phil keeps reliving the days, nor does it ever explain why he stops. Just like everything else in life, it just happens. I'm sorry it took me so long to watch this pleasant movie from 1993. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely check out this classic.

True, Damir Adrei, Barbara Garrick, Tom Hulce and Jesse James WERE in the movie, but you'd think Hayden Christensen, Jamie Bell and Rachel Bilson were just bit players!      I LOVED this movie, BTW.

0812550757|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I've ever read.<br /><br />This book is the second of six in the 'Ender' series by Orsen Scott Card. It continues on with Ender's story, albeit some 3000 years after the first book. And  although there is barely any resemblance between book 1 and book 2,  you won't be able to make much sense of book 2 without having read  and understood the ramification of book 1.<br /><br />The setting for this book is a far off distant planet; the tale is one of emerging discovery not only between individuals but also between species. i.e. humans and a new alien life form found there. I found that Card has done much more with his character development of people (and aliens as well) in this book, giving them a much broader depth of character, moral fiber and some individual weaknesses and shortcomings. This tale seemed to be more about the 'people' in the book, rather than solely about the circumstances they find themselves in (well, this statement is not completely accurate, but  you'll understand what I mean once you begin reading).<br /><br />On the broader scale this book could be view as a microcosm of life on earth; replete with different groups, different races; all with their own unique and different agendas, encompassed within a sphere of distrust and misunderstanding. Card does a masterful job of drawing the characters and story together to make one very satisfying, magnificent read.<br /><br />I do have some minor concerns for this book, but I'll comment in a P.S. As this may constitute a spoiler to some.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />O.S. Card has written a sci-fi novel for the ages and although different from 'Ender's Game' as it can possible be, was better in many regards. I found the story and writing...addictive!. The book itself was almost impossible to put down; I always had to read one more chapter. And despite my minor protestations below, this book easily rates 5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson<br /><br />P.S.<br />My concerns  *** possible SPOILER ***<br /><br />1.)The alien race that was discovered on this new planet were referred to as 'piggies' because their physical features had pig-like characteristics. Somehow the manner and tone with which this obviously very intelligent race of aliens was continually referred to, seemed almost racist and somewhat condescending. Let me state that this was different than book 1 (Ender's Game) where the aliens were called 'buggers' (because they looked like insect) but 'buggers' didn't seem to have the same 'off' connotation as 'piggies' because there was no actual personal contact with these aliens, to give them any real endearing identity.<br /><br />2.) The only real flaw I found  in the concept and the telling of this story was towards the end, with the 'treaty' drawn up between the 'Piggies' and the humans. The concepts of this 'treaty' were hastily drawn up and even more hastily agreed to than seemed realistically wise; one wonders if the lack of a 'due diligence' process was for the sake of novel brevity. Some of the items within the 'contract' had me thinking...\\"hmmm, I can see that part of the agreement causing problems a few years into the future.\\"<br /><br />3.)And finally, a real picky point, I can't for the life of me understand reason for the cover on this book; it appears to have nothing to do with the geographic locale where the story occurs, or for that matter, with the story itself...Strange!<br /><br />P.P.S. many thanks to my friend 'Critical Mind' a.k.a.

B000002U9Y|4.0|\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" was the second and last Pink Floyd album with contributions from original guitarist and lead-singer Syd Barrett. Drug-abuse and illness gradually prevented Barrett in performing with the band and by the time of the album's release he had been replaced by Dave Gilmour, who also plays on the album.<br /><br />Whereas Barrett wrote the vast majority of the material for their legendary debut album \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" his contribution to this album is down to one song and he is absent on more of the other tracks.<br /><br />Generally the album lacks the charm and inventive songwriting of Barrett's and apart from his own \\"Jugband Blues\\" and Roger Waters' \\"Corporal Clegg\\" there is really not much left of the early Pink Floyd approach.<br /><br />On the other hand the album leaves more space for the other members, not least bassist Roger Waters, and the album has clear indication of what was to come in the future. \\"Let there Be More Light\\" almost sounds like an outtake from later albums such as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Obscured by Clouds\\".<br /><br />Keyboard-player Rick Wright wrote quiet songs for the album. \\"Remember a Day\\" is quite a nice tune and by far the strongest of the two. \\"See Saw\\" is more or less forgettable.<br /><br />The title track is an extensive 12 minutes instrumental - more or less random sounds that eventually ( app. 8 minutes ) develops into a nice organ chord progression - actually a pretty longwinded wait.<br /><br />Compared to their debut album, most people probably will find \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" a disappointment, but the album has its moments, especially when the presence of Barrett shines through. At any rate the album gives a great insight to the musical transition the band went through when Barrett had to let go of his leadership.
0061689246|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie so I thought I'd love the book, but it wasn't that great. I'm actually surprised they bothered to make this book into a movie at all but I'm glad they did. It's an interesting concept but the story kind of fell flat. You didn't really get the sense that the characters were falling in love, they just suddenly decided that they were. They didn't really resolve their problems either. The problems just seemed to magically disappear at the end. It was almost as though the author got tired of the story and just decided to end it with everyone living happily ever after. It wasn't the best book, but it was a quick read. It was worth the short investment of time that I gave to it.

1400082773|5.0|The kindness of Obama's understanding of human condition just brought tears to my eyes.  The truthfulness and sincerity of his search to understand his identity, to exam the choices that he made is inspiring and moving.  As an immigrant coming to this country, living through Obama's story is to transcend my own experience to look issues beyond my personal frustration, anger and isolation rather a human condition that we are all facing.  Reading his poignant self examination makes me wonder had I be more courageous, more sincere to listen my inner voice what choice would I make?  I am glad that it is Obama with his worldly life experience, solid value and kindness toward human condition that is our president in this critical moment of our national history.
0385733577|5.0|My daughter (9yrs.) and I both read this book.  It is a great story and although an easy read for adults, its very good for tweens.  There is the whole magic element and fantasy battles, but no inappropriate language or sexual content, which is hard to find in children's literature today.  The story itself is a lot of fun with interesting folklore, mythology, and fantasy abounding with two kids summoned to save the current day world.  I, as an adult, enjoyed the story and found it mysterious, adventurous, alluring, whimsical, and wonderfully written.
0375703861|2.0|I've just finished this novel and I must say, I just don't get it.  It won two prestigious literary awards, plus has had any number of luminaries gushing over it.  Huh????  I honestly don't even get what the novel was supposed to be about.  It meandered all over the place, with characters dropping in and out of the narrative willy nilly. For example, Clara, who figured largely in the early part of the novel, drops out completely one third of the way through, and only makes a minor reappearance later: the author spends a long time describing the animal liberation group FATE, only to have them suddenly disappear into the ether.   The characters were, without exception, objectionable, nasty pieces of work and not one of them engaged me emotionally.  The novel is too long and I really found it a hard slog to wade through for very little return. I do not recommend this novel - please,spend your money on something else, don't waste your time with this.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I suppose it's only fair to state up-front that I am a fan of Joss Whedon.  I think he cares more about putting out quality material than conforming to the opinions of studio and network executives who are more interested in making a profit.       That said, Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog is an amazing piece of work.  Neil Patrick Harris(super-villain wannabe), Nathan Fillion(super hero with defects) and Felicia Day(singing damsel in distress) put on an incredible performance that I find difficult to believe was delivered on a shoe-string budget.  I was so wrapped up in the music and comedy that I completely failed to notice that many of the effects are completely cheesey, and now I find that endearing too.       If you haven't seen Dr. Horrible, see it.  I promise you, you'll be glad you did.  If you don't like it, and you downloaded it for free, I'll double your money back.
0316017922|5.0|I just finished reading Outliers by Malcom Gladwell. The book is inspiring in the grandest of ways. It inspires not only because the outcome to these stories is pleasant and rich but because they are entirely possible for each of us. He took on the task of finding and sorting through the barrage of inquiries about the rich, famous, and poor to eloquently narrow down exactly what we all need to hear: hard works pays off.<br /><br />Now, this concept is misleadingly simple. Obviously hard work pays off but it's not always so easy for those without the means or chance to succeed. We often don't have the resources necessary to get getter. Most of our schools don't provide the sort of time and dedication necessary to learn strenuous subjects like math or comprehensive reading. Math, as discussed in the book, is something that takes time and dedication. You often find a hundred ways a problem can't be solved before the solution pokes its head through the din of your thoughts. Its enlightening, exciting, and addicting. What we need is the kindling of this fire through patience and prodding. We stigmatize those who don't succeed immediately through impatience and grades before simply writing them off as inept.<br /><br />The problem isn't that we are all lazy but that we misunderstand where skills and \\"talent\\" come from. There is a misconception that elite genes are the unique source of all great people. What Malcom details in this book are that these people are great because they had opportunity and patient advisers? None of the greats reached their apex alone and neither will most of us because we haven't grown up with an attitude of hard work paying off the same way our Asian cousins have. We value free time a lot more than we probably should since hard work is a reward in itself. There is a lot to make us temporarily happy in this world but only productive and meaningful work can provide a feeling of true accomplishment and pride.
B00007LTIA|4.0|After the two best albums to grace progressive rock in the seventies, with 'Tales From Topographic Oceans', Yes once more creates magic, but not quite at the same level as 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge'.    Gone from this album is Bill Bruford, the very best drummer to grace early Yes.    John Anderson and the core group of Yes move their creative paterns on to epic proportions:  Tales is truly a progressive rock masterwork.    Two disks, containing four themed songs (really operas) are still excellent, even though Alan White's drumming just doesn't hold a candle to Bill Bruford's - not to dis Alan, he is a great drummer, just not quite in the same ballpark as Bill Bruford.    All in all, this is the last decent album put out by the 70's version of Yes.    Enjoy!
0143038419|4.0|As a single mid-lifer, I liked Liz's mother's story concerning marriage.  I also found myself laughing at some of Liz's statements that hit home and were very funny. I look forward to reading more books from her as she continues to explore.  Sometimes, single unmarried people view things differently than others.  Liz really DOES think about things before just jumping in and this is 1 of many reasons I thoroughly like her and what she has to say.
B000NIVJEU|1.0|The director and producer of this movie need to roasted on a spit, (preferably using dragon fire). Had higher expectations of this movie, (but then again that was the lead characters line). The concept and CGI's alone would rate 4 stars, however the only word I can use to describe the dialog is \\"cheezy\\". Perhaps they can dub in new lines? Of course they leave the ending open for sequels, but given the inadequacy of this movie, who would want to see one? Eye candy right now with blu-ray, but that is all I can say for a completely botched effort. A complete waste of Jeremy Irons and John Malcovitch.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|Love Ed, Love Viggo but are you telling me that with all the known and unknown actresses in hollywood, that Ed couldn't find anyone better to play Renee's part???     i don't dislike her as an actress but she is not right for the part of temptress in any movie.    i do love a western though and i hope this isn't the last one from Ed or Viggo
0307455874|2.0|This book does not offer anything new about Obama or his political views.  If you support Obama, then you will enjoy the book and continue to support him.<br /><br />On another note, he talks about the centralization of the American Political System, which falls in line with the continued centralization of power in America.  What Obama fails to realize about centralized power is that it (almost always) equals tyranny.<br /><br />When reading this book, you almost get the sense that Obama was certain he would be the next president of the United States.  In my first book titled \\"The Conspiracy Fraud\\", I predicted that Obama would win the presidency.  It was an easy guess because the globalist needed a dramatic \\"face-lift\\".<br /><br />Jose M.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|Mickey Rourke plays a past his prime glamour wrestler who is estranged from his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood [[ASIN:B00013RC2K Thirteen]]). After a heart attack, a past her prime stripper which he is trying to woo (Marisa Tomei) urges him to reconnect with his daughter.<br /><br />On paper, the plot of The Wrestler sounds cliche. But this film is more than the sum of its parts. Whereas modern films often turn on some obscure and predictable plot point, The Wrestler is carried by outstanding acting, writing and direction. Rourke is more than the stereotype of the beat down hero. He's sincere. He wants a place in the world. But there isn't a place for retired wrestlers-only retired investment bankers who pursued an MBA from birth and have second homes and trophy wives.<br /><br />My sincere thanks to the people involved in this project. Thank you for taking the time to make good art. Thank you for developing characters and delivering great performances. Thank you for writing more than a hackneyed rerun of some past Hollywood hit. And thank you for direction that moves this story beyond the trite.<br /><br />The Wrestler is one of the best films you'll see in your life. Spend the money to see this one in theaters.
031606792X|5.0|Speaking from a woman, wife, and mother's point of view, this last book was the perfect finale to a wonderfully tangled and passionate love story!  From remembering my teenage years to the climax of adulthood (speaking as a fairly young mom!) through books 1 - 4, this series was hypnotic and addictive.<br /><br />My 11 (nearly 12) year old daughter absolutely loves all things Edward and Bella as well.  She was every bit as engrossed in their love story as I was all the way through book 4.<br /><br />Personally, I can't wait for Stephenie Meyer to complete and publish Midnight Sun.  I hope that she re-writes the entire series from Edwards point of view!  It is guaranteed to be just as enthralling in my opinion.
0930289234|4.0|This book is really enjoyable. In many graphic novels I have read I've been kind of overwhelmed with all the action, but in this I felt like the action served a purpose to the overall plot. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes novels of any kind.
0307454894|5.0|From the book:     \\"There's no need to talk, because the truth of what one says lies in what one does.    \\"At any rate, that's what I think when I just happen to think about it.  But if something hurts me, the hurts I suffered back then come back to me, and when I feel guilty, the feelings of guilt return; if I yearn for something today, or feel homesick, I feel the yearnings and homesickness from back then.  The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed or pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive.  I understand this.  Nevertheless, I sometimes find it hard to bear.\\"    This book was hard to read for me but I feel blessed to not have been a part, in any way, of Nazi history.  The book doesn't focus on Nazi history but it is described.  It is a love story.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Actors George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake-Nelson, Charles Durning, John Goodman, Michael Badalucco and Holly Hunter are really wonderful in this and have a field day with their characters.    Screenwriters Ethan Coen and Joel Coen, and director Joel Cohen deliver, as usual for them, a unique and original movie that entertains while always being smart.    They have a group of actors they work with a lot and the chemistry works great.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Great film, definitely recommend owning it.  Not sure how this compares to the blu-ray offering or the special edition offerings.  Overall if you want the film without a bunch of extra's this is the best bet.  if you are looking for indepth commentary this may or may not have it, i only really cared to watch the movie and I lack the time to delve into what else the disc offers.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Enough has been said about this DVD already!  Just buy it!!  It is a blast to watch!  I originally watched it online and jumped at buying it as soon as it was released!  If you are a fan of Joss Whedon, campy musicals, comics, etc. you'll love it!  Everyone loves it!
1400064287|5.0|This book is a very easy read AND is memorable because it follows the very principles it touts.   The authors of the book clearly \\"eat their own dogfood\\" and apply the SUCCES principles to each section of the book. The lessons are memorable and relevant.    I hope my competitors don't ever read this book.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|It has always been my favorite movie and the picture and sound is much improved from the dvd version.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|My god, this is one piece of brilliance! Dr. Horrible is just another amazing work to come out of (the all mighty robot king) Joss Whedon's head. I suggest you try it on.
B001EN71DG|5.0|The movies are great and it is nice to have both, the original and the digitally mastered versions.
0312330537|5.0|A love story in the wide sense of the word! Incredibly moving story where the \\"bad\\" guys are the good guys, a story of bravery beyond belief...
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I have not seen a move like this for a long time. I was excited and scared at the same time. It's so interesting that 150 minutes flew by like 30 minutes. There was no dragging or boring at all.    Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar! He scares me more than 99 percent of the horror movies I've ever watched. This film is deep, dark and full of interesting twists. It's entertaining and thrilling to see the Joker repeatedly outwitted Batman and other people.     The love story is tormenting. The action is quick and breathtaking. The special effects are eye-catching. Especially, when Harvey Dent's face was disfigured. I love the psychological scenes. The first one is where people on the 2 ferries had to decide which boat to be detonated. The second one is when Two Faced transformed to a killer.    Of course it has logical holes but that's why it's based on a comic book. This movie is perfect in all terms in my opinion. It should be called BESTMAN the Dark Knight.
0201633612|5.0|This is a very good book by the famous GOF. I feel that this volume is a must have for the experienced application programmer.    On the way to become a more matured programmer, one begins to realize the relationship between machine and man. For system programming, the code should tip towards machine, that is, the ultimate goal is to make the program be as efficient as it can be. On the application programming side, it should be the other way around, and the code should be as readable as possible even when this means that the code would not be running at the most efficient way possible. Machine time is sacrificed for human developing/maintaining time.    After understanding the relation between close to machine and close to man, one then realizes that the programming concepts including OO, Design Patterns and the like are here to serve the purpose of helping human understand the code and not to help the machine. And only when the complexity introduced by using these concepts are much less than the complexity they reduce should people decide to use them. You must know your goals and what you are doing. Applying Design Patterns for the sake of applying Design Patterns do not necessarily add any benefits, and it could potentially do more damage than good.    I realize that this book is like a grammar book in any language in the sense that you do not study grammar books to learn the language itself. Instead, the best time to study the grammar is when you already know how to speak, listen, read and write at a pretty high level. It will, at this point, when you study grammar, greatly enhance your power and control over the language.    This is a very good book to have on the bookshelf and to open and read from time to time.
B00005LK95|4.0|I never really cared much for Short Circuit or Short Circuit 2, but its hard to forget Johnny 5. I have maintained that Wall-e and Johnny 5 look too much alike. I was surprised that the people who made Short Circuit & Short Circuit 2 didn't take the people who made Wall-e to court.
B000LF73ZE|4.0|This book kept you turning the pages. I read A LOT, but I must say this book took me by surprise. And the best part....when I picked up this book to read it, I had no idea it was being made into a motion picture. I loved this book. I did not care to much for the way some of it was written, but who am I to judge? :) All in all, this book was excellent.
0312427999|1.0|This book is twisted. Either the author has no grasp of Friedman's teachings or, more likely, this is a hatchet job on one of the greatest economic thinkers of our time.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Lots to enjoy here in a big, big movie.  You get Indy, interdimensional beings, the 50's, and more in this action adventure multi genre thrill ride.  Ford was great as the older Jones, and gave a lot to enrich the character in often subtle ways.  The rest of the cast was great as well and the crew did a top notch job putting the film together.   The 2 disc blu ray version has tons of special features and delivers an awesome hi def experience.  Cant wait to see the first 3 on blu ray.  Some people didnt like the fact that there were \\"aliens\\" in a Indiana Jones movie, but those are the people who tend to make fetish out of the same movies almost the same way people make fetish out of religious iconography.  They want pretty much the same old movie run thru a copy machine and sprinkled with pixie dust or something.  Ya cant please everyone, but some people cant make up there own minds and need to told what to like.  So beware the anti Lucas/Speilberg naysayers club and their blind zombie followers.  End of rant...  If you liked previous Indy movies check this one out.  At the very least rent it.  Peace.

B00005JPAO|3.0|A system that exists from a much previous time broke down when Princess Diana died. The movie is a chronicle of how bad things were, somewhat cleaned up for the press? No matter how good Helen Mirren's mimic of Queen Elizabeth was,the point that seems to be missed is that between them Charles and Queen Elizabeth drove Princess Diana to her death? The Queen should have let Charles marry for love in the first place instead of finding a political alliance that ended in tragedy? The system of royal marriages has ever been broken? Royalty as a system involved in government is a failed one.<br />Historically, the casualties have been enormous.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Neil Patrick Harris (the mad scientist wanna-be), Nathan Filion (the over-the-top smarmy hero), and Felicia Day (the love interest) turn in great performances in this send-up of the mad-scientist vs hero genre of films.  Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly/Serenity) turns in another great story/concept.      Originally a three-part web production, the DVD combines the episodes into one movie and includes a commentary and a bunch of extras.    The acting is great, the music is catchy, and I guarantee you'll be singing \\"Bad Horse, Bad Horse... \\" the rest of the day.
0385339682|4.0|That is well worth reading.<br /><br />I am a real fan of Grishom's work, having read most of it.  This book represents his style perfectly; he creates a vivid southern setting and characters that kept me interested in the crime, courtroom thriller/drama.<br /><br />The narrator is especially likeable, starting out as a recent college graduate who buys a local small town paper.  He is cocky and self assured at first, but he matures in a very realistic way.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is the characters and the southern setting.  Grishom paints a beleiveable picture of a southern town in the early 70s.  The characters are colorful and some are downright hilarious in their actions.  I especially like the names he gave some of the characters (Pud Perryman for example).<br /><br />This book is not perfect.  There are several holes in the plot that I wondered about as I read the last page, and I was a bit disappointed at the end, but that's probably because I liked the characters so much.<br /><br />Overall, a person won't go wrong with this book to read over a vacation lying by a pool with a cool drink in your hand.  I bet you'll smile, maybe even laugh a few times.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I have owned my Swivel sweeper for 2 years now. When it works it is amazing. I love how light it is - my 18 month old could push it around. It is able to go under almost every piece of furnature without haveing to move it and it gets into courners beautifully. It's easy to empty and easy to clean.    Here's the rub, the directions explicitly say not to charge the battery over 8 hours, but if you're like me you naturally charge everything else (phones PDAs camera batteries ect) overnight so you have a freash chage in the morning. If you leave the battery on the charger too long it KILLS the batery. I was very careful witht eh first battery and it only lasted me 1 year. My second battery is barely holding on to life - it will work for maybe 20 seconds before dying. At $10 a pop I cannot afford to keep buying batteries, and as a busy mom I cannot keep track of a high maintance battery that needs to be coddled and taken off the charger after an hour.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Not the worst movie ever made, but the intentionally jerky camera work is annoying. They spent some money making it, and the special effects are good, if you can get past the camera work, I couldn't. At least the equally disappointing Blair Witch Project had an excuse (for the camera work, not the story line), no budget. I didn't like the lack of explanation for what was happening either. Normally, part of my enjoyment of a film is when they tie everything together and you understand what is happening. It's a cop out when they \\"leave it to your imagination\\", meaning they didn't have the imagination to tie it all together.

B001PPGAIA|3.0|I know what Baz Luhrmann was attemting to accomplish with Australia. He even hinted at it himself with regards to Gone With The Wind. He wanted a glorious epic of mass proportions but what he really created was a long, beautiful, but sometimes dull film. He strived for perfection but clearly didn't quite make it.     I am a HUGE fan of Moulin Rouge. I love everything about it-the music, the acting, the costumes and the story. I can see some of that shining through in Australia as well. The beautiful array of colors, just splendid choreography and direction, there is no question about that. The problem lies with the script and the plot.     This movie did not need to be over 3 hours long. I do not mind sitting through a film that long- I have done plenty of times before. But there were obvious parts that just dragged and some that were not necessary at all. The parts with the cattle drive were especially tedious, and that was most of the film...    The 'magic' aspect didn't really fit into this. It worked in Moulin Rouge but for obvious reasons. This to me, is more of a serious film with serious issues. Stealing aborigines children and removing them from their home is something that should have been the main aspect of the plot. But it was muddled along with the other, less important subplots. Of course there is a bad guy-nicely played by David Wenham, and a hero-Hugh Jackman.    Jackman is the true gem in this film. He carries basically the entire film and at least makes it more interesting to watch.  Nicole Kidman, usually a huge favorite of mine, seemed somewhat lost in this. She appeared to overdo most of her lines and while she looked lovely in her part, it just didn't suit her all that well. I was a bit surprised at that. The little aborigine boy, played by Brandon Walters was a heartwarming surprise. His acting,  I thought, was extroadinary.     The climax of the film was more anticlimatic than anything. Just a tad predictable. I am indifferent with how it played out, though the very end gave me a slight lump in my throat...    All in all, a worthy and well-made film. Clearly it took a lot of time and effort on everybody's part and should be commended. It's just not the sweeping epic Baz of the rest of us were hoping for.
1600242197|5.0|As a retired soldier I could relate to what the author went through. I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one day. I don't read books to often. This book is great. May God bless Marcus Luttrell and all our Allied Forces.    Daniel Lauzon
B000BT97AO|3.0|The cinematography, 3D animation, and special effects were very interesting... great artistic eye candy.    story is a bit flat and predictable... it's boringly obvious what all the parallels are in the plot with the main and supporting characters.    There were some funny moments, and some interesting dialogue...  It's worth adding to the collection of movies that are similar (yet better) to this film (ie. Labrynth, Legend, Dark Crystal, etc.)
B001HN697C|5.0|We all know from previous Underworld movies, that Viktor killed his beloved daughter, Sonja because of her relationship with a Lycan, Lucian (Michael Sheen). So, while this installment didn't offer anything new in terms of storyline, it did allow us to see Sonja through Lucian's and her father's eyes.  It also allowed us the opportunity to see Lucian's rise to be \\"pact leader\\", but we saw some of the other characters that appear in later Underworld movies (Raze & Tannis), and came to a greater understanding about the divide between the species.     Viktor, the leader of a Vampire clan is determined to use the \\"werewolves/Lycans\\" (who he believes are savages and just need to be controlled) as slaves, protectors and workers, all while controlling the humans and remaining one of the most dangerous leaders on the counsel.  Viktor believes that controlling these mindless creatures and imprisoning them will strengthen his rule. His favorite \\"pet\\" is the strong minded Lucian, a Lycan, who can control his turns from human to werewolf, and who is secretly in love with his daughter, the very independent Sonja. Believing that she has betrayed him (by mingling with the Lycans) and their kind (Vampires), Viktor decides that her demise is the only answer. Of course, Lucian fuelled by revenge, sorrow and regret responds with a swift attack, and soon learns that he has control over both those who are deemed wild and those who welcome leadership.  We are soon privy to a battle between the two species that will go down in vamp/were history and prove to be foreshadowing for the Underworld series. And of course the movie ends with the beginning of the Underworld series and a glimpse of Selena (the very beautiful Kate Beckinsale), revisiting the tale.      I enjoyed this prequel to the Underworld series. I thought that Rhona Mitra's portrayal of Sonja was brilliant (and she definitely favors Beckinsale), and what isn't there to love about the brooding Bill Nighy who is all too real inas Viktor (I think he is the best vamp ever) and the long suffering Michael Sheen, who is the only person that I could see ever playing Lucian. I am even hoping to visit Underworld one more time. After all, I am sure that Selena and Michael could fight evil one more time.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I have wanted this box set for some time and although it seems to be less episodes than previous seasons, it is still nonetheless the best Lost material.  Of course the writer's strike had to screw things up but it clearly does its job setting up the characters for something bigger in the future and really gives a twist ending like no other on tv!

B001DEVZUG|4.0|I've been waiting for sooo long for a best of compilation from Annie Lennox and the day has arrived! It's great to finally have her best of material pulled into one CD. I'm sure they're missing a couple of songs but as all greatest hits compilations, it could never be perfect.  And I'll repeat that again: it could never be perfect! What prevents me from giving this best of compilation 5 stars is the DVD. Not only are Cold and A Whiter Shade of Pale both transferred poorly, the DVD is missing some of her best videos like Love Song For A Vampire!! But ok, let's just say the record label decided to skip that one for whatever stupid reason, they still didn't bother to include the new video for the song Shining Light! Where's the logic in that!?    It's sad to see Annie Lennox's one moment to showcase the best of her solo material represented in this way. Shame on the record label for not being more on top of this! And they wonder why this boat is sinking...this boat is sinking...this boat is sinking....their boat that is.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Amazing music for a fabulous book.  The music fits the mood & tone of the film.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|The Christmas season has always evoked a sense of wonder and mystery for me, and A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM perfectly captures those emotions. Each song conveys that same sense of anticipation mixed with mystery that I used to get when staying up late at night reading Christmas stories as a child. The songs are beautifully sung by Loreena, and each is given its proper attention so that this album (and it is an album, not a random assortment of Christmas boiler plate like most artists release) feels highly polished and cohesive.<br /><br />The songs are not stereotypical Christmas fare, and include very few well known songs. Instead, Loreena has focused on older, rarer songs, each of which is compelling in it's own way. If you already know and love McKennitt, buying this collection is a must. If you're unfamiliar with her but are looking for an interesting, non-traditional Christmas album, again this is a must.<br /><br />4/5 Stars. Another strong effort from one of my favorite female vocalists.
1400097029|2.0|There is no doubt that Banville can write.  But good writing in and of itself does not necessarily equal a good read.  Even appreciating Banville's expert turn of phrase, I still found reading this novel somewhat of a chore.  The novel is narrated by way of the thoughts of an elderly(?) man recalling significant events in his life.  Unfortunately for the reader, neither the man nor his life are particularly compelling or even interesting.  If a book captures my interest then I naturally want to pick it up at every opportunity and immerse myself in the story.  My sole reason for continuing to pick up this book (over too long a period of time considering its length) was to finish it so I could start a new book that I would acutally enjoy.
B001EO748M|5.0|What a fantastic series, i could not stop watching it even though i knew what would happen in the end.
B001HN6972|5.0|I saw \\"The Reader\\" over a month ago and had an almost visceral reaction to the film. The drama is certainly disturbing, as it would be, dealing with the Holocaust and Nazi concentration camps. It also gives the viewer an insight into the generation of Germans who came of age after the war. Although German post-war guilt is not a popular subject, the guilt these young people experienced, (and many still do), is tremendous, as they must come to grips with the crimes of their parents, teachers and others they love. The storyline, which addresses these issues, is unusual, because the point of view is that of a perpetrator not a victim. \\"The Reader\\" had an enormous impact on me. I find myself thinking about it even now - about the characters and the events that motivated and drove them.<br /><br />The film is constructed as a series of flashbacks. Opening in 1995 Berlin, attorney Michael Berg, (Ralph Fiennes), stares out of his office window at a passing train. His facial expression is one of great sadness. As the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand Berg's melancholy and the reasons for his emotional detachment. The image of the moving train segues to a moving tram, where a 16 year-old Michael, played by David Kross, is seated, hunched over, obviously very ill. The scenery is dark and drab, just as Germany was in the early post WWII years. He exits the tram and vomits in the doorway of an apartment building. Young Berg is discovered there, near collapse, by Hanna Schmitz, (Kate Winslet), a 36 year-old tram conductor. She lives in the same building where she discovers the adolescent boy. Hanna cleans him up and takes him home. He has scarlet fever. When he recovers, he returns to find the woman to thank her.<br /><br />The visit turns into a seduction, a very powerful one, as the viewer compares the youth's inexperience and innocence with Hanna's age, experience and apparent nonchalance. Michael is soon addicted to Hanna, and to sex with Hanna. A fast study, he becomes quite comfortable in his role as lover. He is a scholarly boy and loves books. Hanna, seeing a few of his books in his school briefcase, asks him to read aloud to her. She becomes as addicted to Michael as he is to her. Increasingly, however, his reading becomes her primary focus, more so than matters physical. He opens the world of Mark Twain, Homer, Chekhov, Tolstoy and D. H. Lawrence to her, undoubtedly a most extraordinary experience. Hanna's vulnerability is most apparent when she listens to Michael. The affair ends abruptly when Hanna disappears.<br /><br />Fast forward eight years -  Michael is in law school, and he and his classmates attend a war crimes trial where he recognizes Hanna as one of the defendants. She and the other women, former \\"colleagues,\\" are being tried as war criminals. They were guards at a concentration camp and are allegedly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of women. Michael has never gotten over his love for Hanna Schmitz...but how can he reconcile his feelings of love for a \\"monster?\\" And later, as an adult filled with guilt and shame, he is unable to open-up to the people in his life. How can he forgive himself? There are explanations, of course, for why Hanna performed the actions which led to such misery and death. But it is impossible to sympathize with one such as she. One can only begin to understand her complex, intense character...and the secret she keeps to her death.<br /><br />I won't write any more about the film's plot, because to do so would mean introducing \\"spoilers.\\" I think \\"The Reader\\" is a 5 star film which would be a shame to miss, so I definitely do not want to spoil the movie for others.<br /><br />Director Stephen Daldry has done a remarkable job bringing this drama to life, as has David Hare, who adapted the screenplay from a bestselling book by the German author Bernard Schlink. Kate Winslet gives a powerfully haunting performance as Hanna Schmitz, as does David Kross, who is truly remarkableas the young Michael. I will be very surprised if Ms. Winslet doesn't win an Academy Award for her role. Bruno Ganz makes a brief appearance as a law professor, as does Lena Olin as a camp survivor.

B000CNDIZE|5.0|I was 22 and fell in love with a 19 year old local beauty in a famous beach town in California. She and I listened to this as friends and then as lovers. And then as slowly recovering broken hearts.<br /><br />If you let her, Sia will penetrate your defenses and share with you on the deepest level her deepest emotions. Almost every song says something to me along my relationship roller coaster. If my ego were strong enough I would share this album with all my best friends.<br /><br />Give this a shot and listen emotionally. This may be the most moving, beautiful, and painful album you've ever heard as it has been mine. I hope some day I can express myself just a fraction as well as this woman can. Buy this, love this, give it away, buy another copy.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Those who are unfamiliar with Loreena Mckennitt always say \\"who?\\" when I describe her as one of the best female vocalists alive today. Sadly, many have not heard of this brilliant Canadian diva and her particular brand of eclectic New Age music. Sad because she is among the most talented musicians I've ever encountered, deftly weaving cultural music with her own song writing, creating a subtle, lovely tapestry of sound.<br /><br />She is much less famous than Enya, (also far less productive; she's produces a mere handful of records compared to Enya's pile of albums), but that isn't because she is a lesser artist. Actually, she is the superior of the two, and although they both have great voices, I feel Loreena captures a complexity of human emotion that is profound. She is capable of singing sad songs with not just sadness but expectancy, remorse, anger; a full pallet of human emotion.<br /><br />AN ANCIENT MUSE, her first real record in over ten years, is a sold collection of songs, anchored by the excellent \\"The Gates Of Istanbul.\\" Each song has a narrative, storytelling quality that meshes well with the use of rhythmic beats, indigenous instrumentation, and of course Loreena's voice. This is an essential collection for New Age enthusiasts, Celtic fans, and music fans in general. It is different from her older album certainly, but different does not equate to 'worse' as some have said in their reviews. I would agree that this is not quite as excellent as [[ASIN:B000J233SK The Book of Secrets]] but that album is a masterpiece, and those are always difficult for any artist to follow up. Perhaps that is why McKennitt fans were forced to wait nearly 10 years for a follow up album...<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars. A brilliant example of the right was to produce a New Age album.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|Actually not a bad movie in its own right, although fans of the book will scream at the liberties taken with characterizations and the plot.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was very impressed with this show.  The subject matter is more serious than the other novels \\"Cranford\\" and \\"Wives and Daughters\\", but the love story is more intense, and the period detail and sets are outstanding.   The male lead is a very \\"Mr. Darcy\\"/\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" character.  Gripping, quality entertainment.
B000096I9G|5.0|\\"AWESOME\\"!!! Robert Smith & the Cure are simply outstanding on this 3 album CD concert. They play 3 of their greatest album cds, song by song, taken exactly from the original album cd's and perform the songs live. This was filmed in Berlin in 2002. This is simply outstanding, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|The Postal Service put synth-pop on the map and Death Cab for Cutie elevated it to the extreme heights of popularity. However in this case, the majority got it right. PLANS is an amazing, rich, rewarding album filled with beautiful tracks. At times haunting, melancholic, entrancing, and moving, this is an album that resonates on so many levels. The understated beats, understated singing, and well constructed lyrics serve up an album that is beautiful in its spareness. A sort of pop version of Philip Glass.<br /><br />My favorite track, \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" has a chorus line that I've used for the title of this review. It perfectly sums up how I feel about PLANS. Softly soaring is a great description of the music contained in this album.<br /><br />If you don't already own it, buy a copy. It's worth every penny. 4.5/5 Stars.
1564029654|5.0|To see \\"Owl Babies,\\" a board book by Martin Waddell and illustrated by Patrick Benson, is to love it for any young child. So, is it necessary to get to the children's section in your local bookstore, and page through the dozen boards that make up the double-page illustrations? Well, If convenience says no, or if you choose to stay right here, then by all means here's some help.<br /><br />The book is simply very attractive for young eyes. And the approximately 6-inch by 5-inch size, combined with the sturdy boards, is what young ones can handle and handle and handle. Their eyes will love following the pictures as Mommy or Grandma or Big Brother or Sister reads the story. Pretty soon they'll be speaking, or \\"reading,\\" the whole thing as the pages are turned.<br /><br />Such pages! \\"The pictures make it,\\" you might say. If all the paragraphs were typed, they would likely not fill one screen. Yet I cannot imagine the words without the scenes, nor the scenes without the words. What a tender combination. \\"The words also make it,\\" one must add.<br /><br />The very first scene is with the three baby owls, and yes they are right there with their mommy, in their house, which is a hole made cushiony in a big tree. The owl eyes do have it. Those eyes, wide and somewhat startled, looking a bit tentative, especially Bill's, the littlest owl. He seems to be nudging as close as he can to his mother, and she is looking protectively down at him.<br /><br />Well, the three babies wake up in the night, and looking out through the hole in the tree all they can see is the sky.  And the stars. Mommy Owl is not there. The two older babies think (and the author reminds us that owls are always thinking) they know why mommy is away. Getting food. Little Bill is most concerned, all he wants is his mommy.<br /><br />The three babies venture out of their house and wait on the tree branches. They huddle together and think of good things that mommy can be bringing back. But they worry about her getting lost or meeting a fox. And they wish. They wish for her to come home.<br /><br />And she does! \\"Soft and silent,\\" she swoops down through the trees. There is much joy and flapping and bouncy dancing.<br /><br />Will a young child get scared on the first reading of the book? Perhaps so. Yet we recall many traditional tales have scary parts. For the first time, a reader could turn immediately to the page where mommy is back, and then start from the beginning. But that shouldn't be necessary. A reader can always adopt an affectionate and nonscary voice. In a short time the young child will have memorized the whole story. A lovely book.hey wish. They wish for her to come home.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I spent President's Day weekend watching this series.  What a good way to celebrate.  I basically enjoyed the story production, but had so much trouble with Giamatti as Adams....why does anyone think this guy can act?<br />His portrayal of Adam's at the end of the series was better than the first 3-4 episodes.  I thought the rest of the cast did a good job, particularly Tom Wilkenson as Ben Franklin.<br />I did not trust the script for the most part - it seemed contrived.<br />But there were enough good qualities to stick with it.  Good cinematography, good music, sets, costumes.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|As if Eclipse wasn't bad enough, we now have Breaking Dawn, the (hopefully) final entry in the series known as Twilight. I don't care how much you like the series, or how much of a Stephenie Meyer fanbot you are or how old you are, this is book that's really bad.<br /><br />First off, the plot is terrible. It feels like it was stolen from a fangirls' wet dream. There are so many plot errors and jumps. And the characterization is stupid. Secondly, this book is so full of WTH I'm not even kidding.<br /><br />We begin with Bella bitching about her life. She even mentions the fact she hates her glamorous life. C'mon, you're rich, you have a bright future ahead of you, and you have a sexy new car! What's so bad about that? Then we skip to Bella and Edward's wedding. This is a really shallow wedding. We don't get any sense of how beautiful Bella is in her dress or the suit that Edward wears. And then the honeymoon, which is even more shallow. We do, however, know they spend the holiday off the coast of Brazil.<br /><br />Then the sex comes. Oh, Meyer, you couldn't resist, could you. It really was that bad. The sexual discussion is shallow and lame and rather rushed not to mention forced. As for the actual sex scene itself, ridiculous. Bella has no life because she can't get enough of Edward's junk. Apparently male vampires don't have ejaculatory fluid in their penis, so that said, NO girl would want that. Why? Because it'd be a stone cold marble.<br /><br />And another thing, Bella gets pregnant. WHAT THE HELL? But Vampires have no hormonal fluid! This is another classic case of rushed, poor writing. Eddy tells her to get an abortion but she decides not to. So who does she turn to for help? Rosalie. WHY?  Why Rosalie?<br /><br />Oh, so skipping some more pointless. We now have chapters from Jacob's point of view. And what a waste of potential. I thought this would be interesting, but no it's not. It's a pure waste of paper. Notice there is too much dialogue. Why are half the chapters in italics? This is a waste of space. And then Bella gives birth, except the baby breaks many of her bones, so Edward decides to save her by turning her into a vampire. WTH?<br /><br />And I think 18 year olds should not name their babies. Why? Because they name their babies stupid names like Renesmee. Really, Steph? REALLY???<br /><br />I'm not even gonna continue since this book is so bad. THe main point is, this book is a huge waste of time and money. And I've noticed the most recent reviews are all 5 stars and four words long. Most of the 5 star reviews don't say much other than \\"OMG THIS BOOK IS AWESOME AND I CRIED WHEN THE WORDS 'THE END' SHOWED UP AT THE END\\". Are these publisher plants, perhaps? I've noticed that they all say the same thing.<br /><br />In short, don't waste your money on this book. I was really just OK with Twilight by itself.ste of space.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|An excellent portrayal of the times of John Adams. A great visual after reading David McCullough's book of the same name. The actors are wonderful.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this on my 7.1 system. I therefore didn't miss not seeing it in the theaters. The visuals were stunning and sound was superb! I discovered for the first time some neighbors I shared walls with. I forsee years of viewing ahead! Go get it if this is your cup of tea!
B00122A28A|5.0|I never really was a Madonna fan when I was a kid, only hearing her songs \\"Music\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\" play on the radio non-stop, BUT when I heard Madonna's song \\"Ray of Light\\" I got into her music! This album has some of the most amazing songs I have ever honestly heard! It's just very soothing and the songs are so different that it's just amazing how original they are! Here are my reviews for each song!:<br /><br />1) Drowned World/Substitute for Love- 9/10<br />This song is a very soft and relaxed song, where Madonna really uses her vocals. I really love the meaning of the song, but the song itself is pretty good, but not her best from the album.<br /><br />2.) Swim- 10/10<br />What an amazing song! The fact that the song is a mix of an alternate rock beat with a dash of pop, the song gets really catchy. Also, I love the meaning of the song, like she wants to \\"swim to the ocean floor\\" to \\"wash away all the sins.\\" This song out of her whole album has a really deep and true meaning. It's an unforgettable song!<br /><br />3.) Ray of Light- 10/10<br />Best song off the album, best song of Madonna's! It's just so beautiful, amazing, and just reminds you of life. I love how she says \\"quicker than the ray of light,\\" how she sings..... just everything about this song is awesome! The best part is that it's a song that anyone can love- whether or not you are a Madonna fan or not.<br /><br />4.) Candy Perfume Girl- 10/10<br />This is the one of the songs from the album where Madonna is being very sexy, which I like. It seems as if she's talking to a guy calling herself the candy perfume girl, and him the candy perfume boy. I just love the guitar playing in the background (especially by the end) and here unique language (speak delicious fires, magic poison, rock the ocean, etc.)<br /><br />5.) Skin- 9.5/10<br />I really enjoy this song! It has this really chilly feeling to it, but at the same time I love how she is saying touch me in a very mature, yet seductive way. The beat of the song is really different from her usual pop/upbeat songs, but I think it was genius!<br /><br />6.) Nothing Really Matters- 8.5/10<br />Good song, but it's not really one that sticks out. I personally enjoy the remix (club 69 remix) of this song, because it is a lot more upbeat... overall, it's another different song from Madonna's usual.<br /><br />7.) Sky Fits Heaven- 10/10<br />When I first heard this recently, I could not believe I missed this song! It is one of the best songs from her album, and not only are the vocals and beats amazing, but the lyrics are pretty interesting and it's one of the songs you just want to sing and dance to!<br /><br />8.) Shanti/Ashtangi- 9.5/10<br />I'm not going to lie- this song is NOT for everyone. To me, it is  completely different from all of Madonna's songs (and riskiest) but for some reason I love it. The meaning is very nice and also it's a song I love to sleep or just relax/meditate to.<br /><br />9.) Frozen- 9.5/10<br />This song is one of the few songs I feel that have an appropriate music video that matches this song. I love how the song has a \\"frozen\\" feeling to it, from her look in the song to the way she sings it. It is another outstanding song from Madonna!<br /><br />10.) The Power of Good-Bye- 8/10<br />I just like the song. This song has an awesome music video, background music, and she has an amazing voice, but for some reason this song isn't as catchy as the rest of her songs. I think the song is good, but the fact that she has other amazing songs on this album, I feel it really isn't a \\"stick out.\\"<br /><br />11.) To Have and Not to Hold- 7.5/10<br />Not a bad song... but eh I can't really give much credit to this song. I think it fits into her theme of the album, but for some reason doesn't really sound as great as the others.<br /><br />12.) Little Star- 7.0/10<br />The meaning is really beautiful, but it is not a song I would listen to a lot. I think this song was not as great as the rest of thealbum.<br /><br />13.) Mer Girl- 7.5/10<br />Another meaningful song, but I feel like it's more of a story she's telling than a song... Not much beat/rhythm in the song, which I personally love a lot.<br /><br />----------Overall i think this is the best album of Madonna's and I recommend it to anyone who loves Madonna, or just loves good music!------hm in the song, which I personally love a lot.         ----------Overall i think this is the best album of Madonna's and I recommend it to anyone who loves Madonna, or just loves good music!------
0679746323|5.0|Should be required reading in public schools. Debunks the myth that Mao was a heroic figure.  He was devious and a butcher that tried to outdo his mentor, Stalin.  Sheds light on a lot of events from the 40's to the 70's.  Kind of depressing because you know how it turns out.  Mao lives long enough to torture, stave and kill tens of millions of his own people as well as start the Korean and Vietnam wars for his own cynical interests.  A must read.
B000066C1N|4.0|The only reason this soundtrack did not get the full five stars is because I did not think it had enough of Zimmer's amazing score. I have yet to find a score composed by Hans Zimmer than I am even slightly disappointed with. Though it has a much different quality to it than his other works, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron really brings to life the adventure and spirit of the wild west and the animals that call it home. He brings to life the feel of open skies, stampeding horses and endless expanses of open prairie and deserts. You can see the world that Spirit narrates through Zimmer's amazing music.<br /><br />Because the movie has almost no dialogue save for the few human speaking parts and Spirit's limited narration Zimmer's score has to serve in its stead. He does a remarkable job with this, using a perfect and seamless combination of synthesized music, \\"human\\" music like guitars and the full orchestra that one comes to expect from a Zimmer score.<br /><br />Once again the man has proven himself capable of producing a mind-boggling piece of music. No matter the movie, Zimmer will astound listeners with what he creates.
B001EOQWF8|3.0|The visuals and sound are great but I found the 'silent movie' phase of the story boring! Actually dozed off and frankly wouldn't have bought it if I'd seen the movie before. Only purchase if you've seen the movie before and like it, otherwise a rental is a better investment.
B001GQACGE|3.0|Beyonce took a beating on reviews here but I must admit I prefer the \\"I Am\\" disc. \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\", \\"Disappear\\" and \\"Satellites\\" are beautiful songs. Single Ladies and Diva are fun for partying. Your experience may vary...
B00127RAJY|5.0|I hated this DVD (and Jillian Michaels for that matter) for about the first three days of the workout.  Every muscle in my out of shape body ached for three days solid.  BUT after day 4 I noticed that I had more stamina and that my indurance was enabling me to do the entire workout withut having to stop to catch my breath! Now I am getting ready to start level 2 and I have already lost 6 lbs!!!
B00007GZR5|5.0|There are not many works of art that propel and sadden me in the way this film did. Disclaimer: I despise tragic movies; there is enough tragedy in the world for the film industry to not add to it any further. However, What Dreams May Come is a tragedy that helped me center my understandings of true love.     Several friends recommended I view the movie, but I was relunctant to because of the heavy subject matter. I began the movie disgruntled that the tragedy occured so soon; I misperceived initially that it would be about this guy coping with his wife's unfortunate death.     Fortunately, I was wrong. Instead, the next hour and a half revealed the meat that could lay behind the terms \\"soulmates\\", \\"destiny\\", and \\"linked hearts\\" when the intimate connection between two people is true. I finished the movie with tear-stained cheeks, a half-smile, and the irreducible belief that there are spaces where true love persosts.     Now, regardless of the warnings of others, my embattled psyche, and the hopelessness that so often surrounds us in a cultured mired by pessimism, I believe in love.
B000F3T3CS|1.0|After trying 2 copies of this DVD by Virgin Records, I concluded that the recording itself (not the individual disk) was defective.  The audio recording was uneven in volume.  So the item shouldn't even have been released in my opinion.  Amazon was very prompt and cooperative in sending a replacement for the first disk and for accepting returns twice and agreeing promptly to a refend. Five stars to Amazon; One star to Virgin Records for releasing such a poor quality product.  It's a great piece of work, and I would love to have the DVD, if Virgin can correct the audio problem.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|the season is just fine. the only dissapointement - is the 1st disk - I guess I had it slightly destoyed, so that I could not really watch the last few minutes of the last episode on that disk. and now the whole disk is not functioning. which is a shame as it means I will not be able to share the joy of watching with my friends((

B001RHPJBU|4.0|There is no doubt about Phil Collins the past few years. He definitely returned to his fullest form, reuniting with Genesis for a recent reunion, and a retuen to the stage and the re-release of the Genesis catalog, to a whole new generation. But even though that haas been a definite strong point, there are those who want him to head back out on his own. It has been over 7 years since Phil had released a solo album since 2002's Testify, and he has no plans at this time. Nevertheless, his solo efforts have definitely shown that they will whether the testiments of time. But there is a new push to relive Phil's glory days from the 80's and 90's, with a return of a classic serious collection.<br /><br />Phil Collins 1998 Hits marks its return to the MP3 downloads for the first time in a few years. The single compilation focuses in on his biggest songs from the 80's and 90's, and how much they still withstand the test of time. The album does deliver for die hard serious fans of his solo works, and mostly well for newcomers alike. The songs have been remastered nicely, and include a lot of great tracks from his Grammy-winning career. The collection includes great guilty pleasures including his delightful diddies like movie hits from Against All Odds(which was recently covered in less than heartfelt versions from Barry Manilow and Mariah Carey), the upbeat Two Hearts, as well as his deepest songs from the #1 Grammy-Winning 1990 Record Of The Year Another Day In Paradise and his breakthrough smash In The Air Tonight, all the way to his best in mellow ballads like You Can't Hurry Love and a cover of Cyndi Lauper's True Colors. While the collection is great, the album does over overlook a few of his great songs including Don't Lose My Number, the somber notes of Everyday and the peppy I Missed Again.<br /><br />While Phil Collins next year is set to celebrate his 40th Anniversary as a singer and drummer for his solo work, and as a member of Genesis, his songs are still great and fun to listen to. If you haven't yet owned a Phil Collins record, or heard the serious sonnets he has recorded over the years, than seriously get reacquainted with the re-release of Phil Collins' Hits.<br /><br />Songs: A-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B+to.

0375842209|5.0|It took a little time to get hooked, but eventually I didn't want to put it down.  The book is full of painful life in Nazi Germany, but so much love and courage of a young girl.  It is interestingly written by the male, Death.  It is actually odd and scary from this point of narrative, but also beautifully develops the story.  I bought the book and will keep it, as I have such a fondness for the story.  One of my favorites!
B001N44BVQ|3.0|I was excited to see this simply because Ridley Scott makes movies I really, really like. Black Hawk Down is probably the greatest war action movie ever FOR ME, so expectations were high for this one. Scott always seems to combine plausible, well thought out and executed stories with great action and Body of Lies is right there, maybe a notch or two below his best stuff, but still very entertaining. The topical plot weaved an interesting story with twists and turns and was a believable slice of CIA operations in the middle east. I was at first a  little put off by the sort of mini 'plots within plots' way DiCaprio's character went from one mission to the next..it seemed a bit disappointing to know the entire movie wasn't about a singular blockbuster CIA plot/plan ,etc.. but everything does eventually tie in , sort of , to Jordanian intelligence bailing him out in the end.  The action was not on par with Black Hawk Down (nothing is), but it's still exciting and suspenseful. Crowe and DiCaprio performed well, though I'm not sure if I fully bought DiCaprio as a hotshot CIA agent. Another winner for Scott, though not his best, definitely rentable.

0307269752|4.0|I read this book for my book club.  I was leary about it since it was a translation and, to coin a phrase, something always gets lost in the translation.  You would never know it was a translation.  It reads like any other novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It took many twists and turns and kept you interested the whole time.  I highly recommend this book.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|Okay, I bought this because my wife insisted...  But I really do like musicals, and this was a very good one.  It wasn't Chicago, but very enjoyable to watch.  Meryl Streep really throws it all into this one, and the cast looks like they're having a fine time doing it.  Mr. Brosnan isn't the greatest singer, but he does a good enough job not to detract from the overall movie.  And the locations are excellent, they really pop on the blue ray disc.  And who didn't like Abba?  C'mon, you know you did.  Enjoy this one for what it is, a funny musical with a great soundtrack that you can't help but smile and laugh when you watch it!

B000002UY5|5.0|I've been looking for this song \\"NO RAIN\\" for so long, since about 10 years ago and didn't know who it was? This song is so artistically done and the video \\"NO RAIN\\" is excellent and is about a little girl who is laughed off of stage after dancing a jig and she's crying and finally runs off of stage out into the world looking for acceptance and denied several times until she comes to this gate and peers in, and she finds all these adults and kids dancing in this field and this look of joy overcomes her and she runs in to join them and there she finds her acceptance and fits right in happily ever after. During all of this the vid cuts in and out showing BLIND MELON playing their wonderful song, \\"NO RAIN!\\" The music on the cd is excellent too, if you like variety! Rock to Acoustic!

B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I'm very sorry to say that this is one on the worst movies I have ever seen. The \\"insights\\" developed by the author are absolutely wonderful bits of... insight, and deserve the exposure they have received. Mr. Redfield should have not listened to his intuition (probably tainted by ego)  but let professionals helm this movie. They would have smoothed out the naivté and just plain awfullness. The only reason I watched this movie through (although in two sittings, I couldn't take the whole thing at once, too bored and exasperated) was because I hoped that the strength of the \\"insights\\" would offer a bit of exhaltation or SOMETHING. Nope, only exasperation and frustration at the wasted opportunities for an uplifting film. How anyone (especially a fan of the \\"insights\\") can not hate this movie is mind-blowing.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a movie I never get tired of.  Diane Keaton is the best. It was nice to see this side of Jack Nicholson too.  And a hunk like Keanu Reeves really spiced the movie up.  I love the ending. It's a \\"feel good\\" movie, definitely a chick flick.
B000000Y27|5.0|This is my favorite Jazz Guitar album and one that I've had for some time, first on a cassette that I got from my brother and eventually on CD.  I used to listen to this in my car and didn't even know the names of the songs or who had written them.  All I knew was that I really dug Montgomery's guitar playing.    After getting the 1987 version of the CD, I learned that the album included Sonny Rollins' \\"Airegin\\", Dave Brubeck's \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\", 2 standards, and 4 originals by Montgomery.  I also learned that his supporting cast included Tommy Flanagan on piano and the Heath brothers on bass and drums.    This album is a real pleasure to listen to, not just for Montgomery's truly incredible guitar playing, but also for the relaxing atmosphere all 4 musicians create.  This is a perfect album to play late at night before going to bed; just turn down the lights, lie down on your couch, and let the music soothe your soul.    My only negative comment is that the sound on the 1987 remastering was kind of muddy.  I see that a new remastering was released in June 2008.  While I hate buying CDs a second time, I think I'll order that for $10.99 and hope that it sounds better.    Postscript:  I did buy the 2008 \\"Keepnews Collection\\" version.  It does have slightly better sound, mainly stronger bass.  The real value of this version, however, is the new booklet with a new essay by Orin Keepnews, who produced the original sessions.  He explains how he first heard about Montgomery from Cannonball Montgomery, talks about the first two records (including this one) that Montgomery cut for Riverside, and explains the boastful title.  He also puts the album in the broader context of Montgomery's brief but brilliant 9 year career.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|As an Englishman living in Germany, where Bollywood films are dubbed and therefore much eaier to understand than with subtitles, I now know a lot about Bollywood, from both the Masala and the Parallel sides.     \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" manages what very few films have done before it,(perhaps Ram Gopal Varma's \\"Satya\\" was the closest), in that it combines both the Indian genres. It is a \\"parallel film\\" (ie. an Indian Arthouse movie) in its construction, but it has a \\"Masala Movie\\" (ie. a Bollywood Blockbuster) feeling in its execution.     In other words, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" makes you think about the subject matter (which is arthouse), but it also makes you feel good at the same time (which is blockbuster). That is, it has a deep meaning (ie. that the slum people know things too, which could help the country to progress), but also a flashy cinemagraphic execution (for example, when one watches it, one has the feeling that something new in cinema has occurred, just like with Danny Boyle's earlier film, \\"28 Days\\").     As far as the Bollywood influences go, Danny has obviously taken time to study the art-form of Indian cinema closely, and any Indian who doesn't appreciate and respect that aspect of the film is banging his head against a wall for the sheer fun of it. Because at its core, the film IS Indian, full of the lifeforce and charisma of Mumbai. Though interestingly, apart from the Hindi speaking kids, who are FABULOUS, the NRI in the cast seems to understand the subtelty that Boyle is after much better than the Mumbai based actors. It's a shame, for instance, that for the film's balance, SRK did not accept to play the role of the quiz-master, as he would have given, as the character of Fate, a far more inspired and impressive counterweight to the background story than AK does. But nevertheless, AK brings everything he's got to the role, and obviously enjoyed it.     As for Mumbai, and the criticism in India of showing the slums too graphically... Well, I'm sorry, but I know Mumbai, and it looks EXACTLY like it's shown in the movie. Especially North Mumbai, near Juhu.     So, in short, Danny Boyle has done agreat job in capturing the lifeblood of the city, and I'm sure the film's sucess will open up a can of worms in the established Bollywood fraternity, where everything is still extremely caste-based, and where a lot of ingrained filmy-families have a lot to lose if \\"non filmy people\\" start having a success.     But the point is, as the film makes clear, that change has already started to happen with the inroduction of TV, so that already the old style Bollywood of the \\"rich kids with their rich kid's problems\\" is giving way to the specific concerns of the upper and lower middle classes.     Soon, I hope, the lower classes will have their own TV programs too,(which is not that far away, when one considers that a non-touchable recently won the Indian version of American Idol!). And so, when that happens, let the slumdogs cheer! Because then, just as Gandhi envisioned, India really will become a great democracy     Let us hope, therefore, in solidarity with all the slum dwellers, (who are, by the way, some of the kindest people in Mumbai), that the day of equality will arrive there as soon as possible, so that everyone, no matter what caste they're born into, can filfill their true potential ... as a human being.
6304712936|5.0|I see many reviews comparing the various formats, but I wanted to write about this movie, a thrashing good one.  Amadeus tells us the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the perspective of contemporary Salieri, and the device makes for a richer viewing experience because the Mozart depicted in the movie is a divine musical genius, but an immature, prideful man-child in his life.  The film makes the point that he died in poverty, unthinkable today for an artist of his stature.<br /><br />Tom Hulce was nominated for Best Actor as Mozart, not only a musical genius but taking a joyful pride in his music.  This Mozart is presented as an 18th century rock-star, chasing skirts and drinking wine the moment the music stops, in addition to having a certain disrespect for all who are musically beneath him - in other words, pretty much everyone.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham won the Academy Award as Salieri, who is vastly less talented, but at least understands and appreciates Mozart's music.  Salieri's music is a calling, and we're shown early in the film that Salieri has become a kind of musical priest - asking God for enough ability to rise out of his working class background to be able to hobknob with royalty.  He lives an otherwise monk-like life, and when he sees the irreverent Mozart showing scarcely a care for anything, yet apparently touched with an ability that could only come from Heaven, something in Salieri snaps - he vows to crush God's favored musical son. (The film is based on the 1979 play by Peter Shaffer.  The thought to depict the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is based on one of Mozart's letters in which he wrote that he thought Salieri was so jealous he might poison him, but there appears to be no evidence that Salieri was involved in any way with the early demise of Mozart.)<br /><br />Prodigiously prolific, Mozart composed 41 symphonies (to 9 by Beethoven) and 23 Operas (to 1 by Beethoven), along with a horde of genius concertos, chamber pieces, piano works and sacred music.  Genius musicians cannot comprehend the creative gift that would allow Mozart to do all this before dying at age thirty-five.<br /><br />There are a few framing devices in the film - we first see an elderly Salieri many years after Mozart's death, consumed with guilt that he killed Mozart.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks with old Salieri confessing to a Priest.<br /><br />We see the boy genius Mozart, playing piano and violin for royalty as a toddler.  We see the first meeting between Mozart and Salieri - Mozart has been invited to Vienna to perform for the Austrian Emperor Joseph.  Mozart works for his patron, the Bishop of Salzberg, but Mozart is irreverent and disrespectful.  Emperor Joseph (played in a comic turn by Jeffrey Jones) sees an opportunity to woo the promising Mozart to stay in Vienna and commissions an opera - The Marriage of Figaro.  This causes some consternation among the royal house since the opera is based on a play that has been banned in Vienna (due to its satirical view of aristocracy just prior to the French Revolution). Many of Mozart's other unconventional methods are scrutinized and criticized.  After the eventual premiere of Figaro the Emperor comes back stage with his entourage and offers lukewarm encouragement.  When the Emperor can't think of a musical term to characterize his lack of enthusiasm he turns to his Kapelmeister who admonishes Mozart that there are \\"too many notes\\".  Mozart asks \\"which would you like me to remove?\\"<br /><br />Milos Forman won the Oscar for direction, one of eight academy awards for the film.  I saw attempts to recapture the epic proportions of Amadeus later in [[ASIN:B00008RV1S The Red Violin]], [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]] and [[ASIN:B000MV8AE0 Copying Beethoven]], but Amadeus still stands atop the heap of artistic film interpretations of musical greatness.  Amadeus is immense in scale and ambition, but also intimate in moments, serious and light.  Forman's balancing act may take historical licenses, but it engages our attention, our sympathy, and our enthusiasm.t engages our attention, our sympathy, and our enthusiasm.

0525951113|1.0|Typically, I wouldn't be compelled to post a review of a book that I cared so little for. I feel, however, that Daemon is grossly misrepresented here thanks to all the overly positive feedback.    The writing is poor. Perhaps in itself, this wouldn't have been the novel's fatal flaw, if not for its equally deficient storyline. The plot is ridiculously, painfully implausible and disintegrates into total absurdity toward the end. To add insult to injury, the author appears to be confused as to who comprises his readership, needlessly explaining basic concepts, clearly trivial to the intended audience.    The book's ending is as abrupt and anti-climatic as t.    Should you wish to make up your own mind, I will be happy to offer you my copy for the price of shipping.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I'm not really one to take the time to write reviews but this album is one of those rare works that inspires me to take that moment.  Short and to the point.  Excellent music.  Excellent lyrics.  I love Shinedown and this CD is the best yet.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|\\"Step Up\\" brought a smile to my face when I saw it in theatres; so I snapped up a used copy.  Channing Tatum who was SO good in [[ASIN:B0013FSL1Q Stop-Loss]] plays the leading man Tyler Gage, a street kid in a foster home who doesn't dare to dream so he won't be disappointed when it doesn't happen.  His moves are excellent.  I particularly enjoyed how he used the car in the dance on the schoolyard.  Also the scene in the ballet class where the little girl keeps hushing him is perfectly precious.  Jenna Dewan, who cameoed in [[ASIN:B000FUTVLY Take the Lead]] plays the lead here as Nora, the wealthy girl who dreams of dance.  The improbable romance between Tyler & Nora is reflected in their dance moves.  Miles Darby is played by singer Mario who was also in [[ASIN:B000NOK1KM Freedom Writers (Full Screen Edition)]].  Drew Sidora plays the supporting lead Lucy Avila, with a shallow depth and chronic smile.  Damaine Radcliff from \\"Glory Road\\" plays Tyler's buddy Mac Carter.  De'Shawn Washington plays Mac's brother Skinny.  Tim Lacatena has a nice cameo as the injured dancer Andrew.  Josh Henderson who was featured as Austin McCann on TV's \\"Desperate Housewives\\" plays Nora's boyfriend, the self-centered singer Brett Dolan.  Rachel Griffiths, currently in TV's \\"Brothers & Sisters\\" has nice moments as the school director.  Anne Fletcher who choreographed \\"She's All That\\" & [[ASIN:B000PAAJZ6 Boogie Nights]] goes behind the camera to direct.  She does a good job of keeping the pacing brisk.  The music videos and dance contest clips in DVD extras were energetic.  \\"Step Up\\" combines great fun, a splash of romance into a marvelous dance.  Enjoy!
B001NOMNZW|5.0|Does anyone know if the dvd that comes with the blu-ray set has any bonus material?  Or are the bonus features  only on the blu-ray disk itself.  Do you need to order the 2 disk dvd set to get the bonus features on the dvd?
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This will get me 'unhelpful' ratings because people LOVE when you love something. Especially something everyone else LOVES. And it was with the expectation of LOVING this movie that my husband and I went to it today. And unwisely brought our very mature 13 year old son with us.<br /><br />(Note: I'm not a careless parent, far from it. This was the first R rated movie we've ever taken him to. I read about Slumdog online extensively - but I guess I chose to deny the few comments such as \\"tough to watch\\" and \\"rough\\" in favor of the many, many comments and critic reviews that RAVED about how wonderful, inspirational and uplifting this movie was.)<br /><br />Well. What these little children endure in this story--the brutal, vicious, hopeless, filthy, disgusting, violent, despairing, depressing nature of their lives--cannot be emphasized enough. This is not presented in a tame way. It will turn your stomach and make you turn your head away, for at least the first hour, which is when I walked out, sat down on a bench outside the theater, and sobbed.<br /><br />It was an ingenious and engaging idea for a story, and well done. I believed every single solitary second of this movie. But be forewarned, it is EXTREMELY upsetting.<br /><br />False advertising: I'm flabberghasted at the commercials for first the movie, and later the DVD, that show darling kids atop the train (one of the very few light moments in the movie), the jaunty music and even a DANCE sequence??? that is not even in the movie itself, but over the credits. The commercials will mislead you into thinking this is \\"a romantic adventure about a poor kid doing well on a game show.\\" Be forewarned, this is a GRAPHIC, profoundly upsetting movie about the desperate, dire living conditions in the Indian slums. Grim.<br /><br />My rating: for adults with strong constitutions only, and older teens with a serious interest in world issues, poverty, etc.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I enjoy watching Jillian on The Biggest Loser television program.  I also wanted something a bit different to do on those days that I only had 20-30 minutes of time to get in some exercise.      This was only my first day.  I only did Level 1!  It's unbelievable how my body feels after that short 20 minute time frame!  You think, ok, some cardio, strength training and abs.  No problem.  HA!  There are no rests in between exercises.  As Jillian indicates, there's no time for rest if you want the most from your 20 minutes of exercise (my paraphrase).  You work arms and legs at once with every exercise.  She bases her moves on the concept that you work both the small muscles and the big muscles at the same time.  Excellent work for legs, arms, core, abs, everything.    It's a fantastic workout and I'm excited to see what happens with consistency.  I'll try to come back and give an update.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight may not be the best film of 08 but it's one of the top 7 and surely deserving of an Oscar bid. The blu ray arrival is a must own disc and features showcase sound and picture quality. The performance by the late Heath Ledger is timeless and the casting of Aaron Eckhart as two face is also one of the finest performances this year. Not to many big budget flicks live up to their hype but The Dark Knight surpasses it and then some setting a new standard for action films in general. Pick this one up right away if you haven't done so already.

B000HEVZ6W|5.0|When 'Gattaca' was released in '97, it really flew under the radar, thanks in part to a certain big sinking ship. I've known about about the film since its release but never saw it until about a year ago. Needless to say, I was very impressed. How could a film with such a talented cast, a brilliant story, incredible direction just fade out and not connect with audiences?    'Gattaca' is a the story of Vincent (Hawke), a young man who was conceived by natural birth, and his determination to fight back in a world where genetic engineering is the norm, where employment solely rests on how you were born. Vincent decides to take the identity of genetically engineered man, Jerome (Law), an athlete who, unknown by the public, suffered an accident that left him paralyzed. Vincent is now Jerome and is working at Gattaca so that he will fulfill his dreams and be launched into space. However, things take an unexpected turn when a man is murdered at Gattaca and the police arrive to investigate. While cleaning up the scene, a single eye lash from Jerome/Vincent is found, and the police now suspect the murder was caused by him, as Vincent is an \\"in-valid.\\"    While the story has an obvious sci-fi thriller quality to it, one can see that despite being lumped into the genre, it's first a human-drama with many intriguing and challenging questions, which at this day and age seems shockingly relevant. It's a story about the triumph of the human spirit, what its capable of and what it can ultimately achieve.     Everything about 'Gattaca,' technically, is top-notch. Despite having a modest budget, the filmmakers have creatively created a utopia with minimal CGI effects. All set locations are simply dressed up or down to get the effect of a not to distant future, and it works wonderfully.    Andrew Niccol's script and direction is absolutely brilliant and should be leave the viewer believing he's made one of the finest sci-films of all time. It is truly a classic.    Blu-ray info:  Onceagain, Sony does a great job taking care and transferring the film over. The picture is impeccable! The sound is crisp. I was so glad that after watching this film on Netflix a year ago, that the studio decided to release it on Blu-ray. Great job!

B001PPGAIA|5.0|I first saw AUSTRALIA last November on my birthday. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie, but I absolutely loved it and it made my list of top ten films of 2008.<br /><br />Directed by Baz Luhrmann, the movie begins with a written introduction explaining the &#34;Lost Generation&#34; of Australians, children who were half-Aborigine and half-white that were taken away from their parents and raised by the government or private organizations. This is important because even though the film takes pieces from a variety of different genres: adventure, Western, comedy, action, war film, and romance, the movie revolves around one particular child of the Lost Generation, Nullah (Brandon Walters), and his search for identity.<br /><br />Nullah's mother is a servant on the cattle ranch of Lord Ashley and his father is one of Lord Ashley's most trusted ranch hands, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham). Lady Sarah Ashley believes that her husband is sleeping with an Australian mistress and travels to the cattle ranch to confront her husband. Instead of confronting her husband with his infidelity, she instead is greeted by recent murder. She soon learns that her husband had been honest and was giving the ranching life a chance. The Ashley ranch was the only cattle operation on the continent that was keeping the tyrannical King Carney (Bryan Brown) from having a complete cattle monopoly on the continent. With the death of Lord Ashley it is assumed that the Carney will now win a prize government contract and squeeze the life out of any competition left. However, Lady Ashley isn't as frail as she seems and with the help of the nomadic Drover (Hugh Jackman) sets out to win the contract, save the ranch, and keep competition in the cattle trade alive and well on the continent down under. Of course, along the way she and Drover fall in love. And all through the journey Nullah is present as Lady Ashley becomes a mother to the orphaned boy and Drover becomes a father figure. But, that's not all either because in the background is the threat of war as Japan's empire grows and becomes hungry for world conquest.<br /><br />AUSTRALIA is a beautiful film with some of the most gorgeous and spectacular cinematography seen in a film in 2008. The film brings Australia to life and despite the hardships that living there can bring, it's easy to see how people can fall in love with the place. There are a few cheesy moments (e.g. Hugh Jackman showering or Hugh Jackman's entrance into a party), but overall the acting is exceptional, especially Brandon Walters as Nullah and many of the secondary performers. Lady Ashley and Drover are leads next to Nullah, but it is Nullah and the cast of non-lead characters that dominate the film and make the movie from just being an overblown love story into a film about a national epic about the people of Australia.<br /><br />AUSTRALIA was panned by the critics and though it did reasonable at the box office, it was in incredibly expensive film to make (it took about nine months of filming). However, everyone I've talked to that has seen the movie have really enjoyed it. It's a great movie that has just the right mix of everything, including an homage to THE WIZARD OF OZ. I'm sure that with the DVD release AUSTRALIA will become a hit and one of those movies that people will wonder why they never got to see it in theatres.not all either because in the background is the threat of war as Japan's empire grows and becomes hungry for world conquest.<br /><br />AUSTRALIA is a beautiful film with some of the most gorgeous and spectacular cinematography seen in a film in 2008.

0060594888|5.0|This book will take you step by step through the process of not only reclaiming your life but becoming everything you were meant to be in life.<br /><br />In the introduction, Canfield recommends that you read the book once from start to finish. After you have read the book all of the way through, then it's time to go back through each of the chapters, one at a time and work the exercises that are included.<br /><br />Canfield basically takes you by the hand and helps you resolve the issues that are keeping you from living the life you want (provided you are honest).<br /><br />Some of the advice is hard to swallow (it was for me), but it absolutely crucial that you accept it if you want to succeed. One piece of advice he gives early in the book is that you have to take responsibility for everything that has happened to you. This doesn't mean that you caused it all, just that you have to take responsibility.<br /><br />The upside to doing this is that when you do, you will eliminate many of the barriers that were holding you back.<br /><br />(This will be a hard piece of advice to accept for those who want to blame society for their problems instead of taking responsibility.)<br /><br />I love this book, and it one of the most effective and step by step plans I've ever read. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to live a truly successful life.

I love how Dean explains his ideas for his books thoroughly and do not just leave you hanging. Every time I finish another one of his books, he has me thinking...it could happen. This book is definitely a must buy and a must read.

The note is signed by Chris. The couple is too nervous to explore the bus but when the forest ranger comes across the worried pair he bravely searches the bus. Chris McCandless' body is found frozen to death in the back of the bus. Chris had already been dead for two months.  For the most part, this book was interesting and well written; however, some of the chapters were dry and unentertaining. There were few parts where I couldn't put the book down. For example, Jon Krakauer tells other explorers unfortunate experiences which were not as attention-grabbing as Chris's.   My largest complaint about Krakauer's Into the Wild was that the story skipped around a lot and we were told some key details before others. For example, I do not like how we found out Chris McCandless' destiny in the first chapter (and for some copies of the book, on the cover). It is not until later on when we realize McCandless' motivation for leaving the civilized world.  In a way, the story is similar to the book The Glass Castle, by Jeannette Walls. In both book the characters choose to live a non-materilized life and they only kepp their absolutely essential possessions. They are both happy with their lifestyles. Both Christ and the parents in The Glass Castle intentionally dispose of their matierals and replace them with resrouces that they found and cannot live without.  Into the Wild is a book that forces the reader to reflect on their lifestyle and the way in which htey are living. Chris seemed happy during his entire journey which makes readers realize that they do not need material items to be happy. It also teaches people to take risks while still being precautious so that they do not end up in situations such as Chris'.  In the end, I give this book four stars, because while I believe that the story was tragic and heartbreaking, I think that the way it was told and the order in which it was told could have been better and more interesting. Other than the order however, I thought that Into the Wild was a good book that tells a sad yet inspiring story.
0743486285|5.0|This book is great read. I love reading about \\"rock stars\\" long, up hill journey in making it to the top. It all looks like a dream and everything you could wish for from the outside. Nikki shares about the good and the bad things in this point of his life. I have never read an autobiography that shared this much truth before. I give Nikki a thumbs up for sharing all the horrifying details about his drug addiction.  I think it takes a lot of guts to put all he did in print for everyone to read. Even if you are not a recovering/present addict, you will still find this book a great read. I think everyone and anyone can read this book and take something it to impact your life. I STRONGLY recommend this book and the soundtrack. The soundtrack is a very emotional filled cd and is just a must listen. The book and cd is a must buy and must have.
0321356683|5.0|I like the book very much.  I program extensively in C++/Windows and was looking for some JAVA references.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I was curious if this would be a good cd due to the emotion when they were written but I was blown away. This is a great cd. A must buy and a must listen.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Wow is what i have to say. Start to finish this c.d. is AMAZING. I bought the album after discovering that this is the author of my favorite song, and i have no regrets. You will not be disappointed.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I don't think I have ever listened to a better soundtrack than this one. It is awesome how every song is in the right place at the right time and explains the right mood exactly. This is a must buy and a must listen!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I love lost 4. Its not as awesome as lost 3 but still has awesome suspense and great action.
031606792X|5.0|This one was pretty much my favorite from the Twilight Saga. It is an exciting ending to the story of Bella and Edward. I do think Stephenie could write a 5th book in this Saga and not be over doing it. I enjoyed Stephenie's writing so much, I can't wait to start reading The Host. Great story! This is a must buy and a must read.
B001QLHRW6|5.0|I'm having a hard time finding the words to review this because how do you explain and talk about something that just seems like is not coming from a mere human.  Her voice and the soul and feeling that comes from her is as if it is channeled from some place higher.  I am in awe at the energy and feeling that comes through that voice of hers.  She has style, music perfection, soul, and light in everything she sings.
0316010669|5.0|This clearly written book will validate for many the thought that your first impulse or opinion of many things is the best. In golf, it would be your first read of the putting line and speed. In life, it would be that queasy feel in your gut when you meet that slimy salesman or, at the other end of the importance spectrum, \\"love at first sight\\". It is worth a look at your own adaptive unconscious as it looks at the object of your interest. It might be the most important book you have ever read.    Hugh A. Dame, MD
B000W91RUG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the humor of the Big Bang Theory. I thought they captured the geek/nerd behaviors quite well for being a sitcom. I enjoyed it enough to watch it multiple times and introduce friends to it. A great show!
6305426694|5.0|The cassette was in very good condition. The story: my wife loves real life movies and if it has her favorite actor... imagine. She loved it.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|The album is at least worthy of listening to but nothing really knocks your socks off on this album. I am a bit concerned about the song Outlaw Pete ripping off the Paint It Black sound from the Stones. I'm not a Bruce hater, so I'm not just dumping duece on the guy.
630349255X|3.0|The movie is wonderful, melting many cultures and places into one wonderful movie.  The drawback is that the music background leaves you a little wanting.  Maybe the music did not come through well when recording.  It seems like it is a vibration that becomes somewhat hard to handle at times. I use the film to teach teenagers in homeschool \\"mental mapping\\".  It works very well for that.
B000NVADJY|5.0|It's a small, but good book.  If your afraid of death or know someone that is....you need to read this book.<br /><br />I think it's a book you will read many times during your life.
031606792X|1.0|Let's face it, Stephanie Meyer is not a good writer.  Her characters all sound the same, and it's either they are annoyingly whiney or excruciatingly wimpy.  Twilight and Eclipse were tolerable, but Breaking Dawn was downright boring in many, many parts, even unreadable. The last book ruined everything. It was just plain stupid.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I haven't watched the DVD yet but listening to the CD gives me goosebumps over and over again for the entire length of the CD.  AMAZING music!
0380730405|5.0|This book is about a young bride's obsession with her husband's dead ex-wife.  When the twenty-one year old narrator meets Maxim de Winters, she falls head over heels in love with him. Some reviewers have complained that the storyline runs too slow in the beginning. I couldn't disagree more.<br /><br />The beginning of the book is a journey to expose the readers to the depth of the narrator's love for Maxim. She loves Maxim so much she mourns every minute she passes with him because it will soon fade away. Even as they sit, talk, or walk together, she is thinking there goes a minute with him I can never relive again. She imagines (and she imagines the worst possible scenarios often!) that years later she will look back on the moments as a distant memory and he won't even remember her.<br /><br />I imagine some readers may not find the narrator particularly appealing. After all, she is painfully shy, excruciatingly self-conscious, and utterly pessimistic. Normally I would find these qualities in a heroine less than desirable, but again I believe she was written this way not only to identify the readers with the intensity of the love she feels for Maxim, but also to show how that love changes her.<br /><br />The narrator's life with Maxim begins with doubts. Her first introduction to Maxim de Winters is that he is a widow who just can't get over his deceased wife's death. When he proposes to her when they meet in a hotel in Monte Carlo, the narrator is stunned but naively believes Maxim and her will soon begin a fairy tale life together in his beautiful estate by the name of Manderley<br /><br />Manderley proves to add to the narrator's insecurities. Not only are there constant reminders of Maxim's former wife everywhere, but the young bride almost begins to lose it imagining how her predecessor strolled down the same long halls, sat at the same desk, used the same phone. To make matters worse, Manderley's housekeeper, the creepy Mrs Danvers, expresses an immediate dislike of the new Mrs de Winters and she takes every opportunity to add to the narrator's fears and insecurities.<br /><br />When I least expected it, a bomb was dropped and the novel took a turn I could hardly have expected. All the casual comments that seemed like useless chatter begin to make sense until the truth behind every mystery is revealed. I didn't really care for the abrupt ending. I feel there should have been a few more chapters, but it was still a wonderful read. I was so enthralled by this book, I actually set my alarm for 6am when I only had a few chapters to go so that I could finish it before my daughter woke up. When the pieces start to come together, there is no way you will be able to put this book down.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|To the reviewer who said this is Judas Priest best album he's lying to you all and to the guy who said British Steel was cheesy metal and fell asleep after 30 seconds of Pain Killer they are NOT Priest fans!First of all anyone who falls asleep listening to Pain killer probably likes ROGER WHITTAKER.Because the truth is to people who don't know PAINKILLER.It has ONE of the best intro's of any Priest song and is ONE OF THEIR HEAVIEST SONGS.Now about cheesy maybe Defenders of the Faith or Turbo might be a little cheesy but not British Steel!Now about This Metal Opera i can see why fans like,love,and hate it.As a huge Priest fan i heard all the reviews about it ,but there was no way i was not buying it.As i think most of us did.If your not a real fan STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD UNLESS YOU LIKE OPERA AND METAL MUSIC.It's not all that bad but please don't say it's the best.The truth is maybe we are all little tired of the same songs and needed something different but we did get that with Jugulator and Demolition those two albums were certainly that not the usual or classic Priest sound.
0784011710|5.0|Quick.  Name me just one bad Meryl Streep performance (or even one mediocre one).  I'll wait. (And [[ASIN:B001GKJ2DO Mamma Mia]] doesn't count.)<br /><br />You're right.  There isn't one.<br /><br />And perhaps Streep's very best role is in the haunting, troubling SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  I've seen this film on several occasions, and it's blown my socks off every time.  Set in post-World War II Brooklyn, this is a story containing nuance, tenderness, guilt, remorse, discovery. . .raw emotion.  And the focal point is Meryl Streep's role as Sophie, a Polish immigrant trying to overcome a most horrific past.<br /><br />Told from the point of view of young Southern writer Stingo (a very fragile-looking Peter MacNicol), we witness the developing relationships of the three main characters:  Stingo, Sophie, and her lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline, who brings this bipolar biologist to vivid life).  Stingo, in effect, becomes a third wheel to the couple, and realizes there is more, much more, to Sophie and Nathan than meets the eye.  And as we move deeper into the story, we the viewers become privy to more and more of the troubling details of Sophie's European past, until the details become not troubling, but horrific, when Sophie must make a most heart-wrenching choice concerning her two children.<br /><br />While Kline and MacNicol are exceptional, Streep is absolutely flawless as the beautiful, yet mortally wounded, Sophie.  Streep is indeed the motor that drives the intensity of this story--a story that will break your heart as it ends.  Streep is not a good actress, she's a great actress; to say SOPHIE'S CHOICE is her very best role gets no argument from me.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
0312383320|3.0|Plum Spooky is another madcap romp filled with eccentric characters and over the top situations. Comparable to the other between the number books, this short novel has its share of laughs, but if you're looking for character development, stick with the numbered Plums.  They reign supreme.  If you want something more in the vein of numbered Plums, try Gemma Halliday or Shelly Fredman's No Such Thing Series.  Well worth it.
B00004RFFS|5.0|The dvd was flawless with no scratches. Plays great and now have watched it like 5 times. would recommend to everyone.

B001ECE6C6|5.0|Another masterful work by Pat Metheny along with the stunning, beautiful voice and talents of Anna Maria Jopek, not to forget the fine Polish musicians and other world contributors to the project. Pat poured his heart into this project and after reading some of the negative reviews on this recording. I have found out there are some listeners that don't really get what Pat's music is all about. How can you compare this album with music or something that has already been sucessfully accomplished in the \\"past\\". This album project shows that Pat is not limited and selfish at all with sharing his destiny to the world and the reflection on how other great musicians can interpret and enhance his art to the fullest. This trait really shines on this project. The negative comments to Upojenie are for those who are uneducated, selfish, and 1 dimensional. This is unfair to Pat & Anna.  Upojenie is a brilliant album in every way. Technically and emotionally.   Pat's contibution to this project shows his musicianship has the ability and power to communicate truth, peace, and unity to all the nations of this world. This is something he has been doing all along anyway in his existence on this planet either with PMG or on his own. Too bad the leaders in this world can't master what Pat Metheny can do when it comes to making this world a better place.  God bless Pat Metheny & Anna Maria Jopek & Friends.
0810979772|5.0|This is such a fun book! My son, who is almost 7, is hooked on Jeff Kinney's books and had read the first two so we had to get him this one too. It's the first one that you can \\"journal\\" in and Jeff makes it all so darn much fun and provides little leads throughout the book to get them started. It's somewhat similar to the Dr. Seuss book titled All About Me which my son really enjoyed. This one is a step above and a bit more advanced. He is almost done filling it up with his thoughts and ideas and has asked for another one to start over with! It's a great book for boys in particular but should get any child into journaling and enjoying it!
B001ED7C58|5.0|As a thirty something Twilight Mom, I can say that this soundtrack is loved by my entire family!  All of my children (ages 2-10)and even my own mother enjoy it as much as I do.  The lyrics are perfect for Twilight and the songs are reminiscent of multiple generations of music.  My only complaint is that they did not incorporate Rob Pattinson's version of Bella's Lullaby.  I know that it probably wasn't chosen because of continuity with the Twilight Score but I thought they could have thrown it in as a bonus on the Soundtrack. Love it and looking forward to New Moon.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Emmylou Harris is one of a very select few singer/musicians who seems to speak directly from her soul to mine. It's clear that her music derives its power from her passion for life. She is not so much a performer as a person who combines her heart with musical instruments and with the talents and gifts of other singer/performer/musician people. Her music nourishes one's soul.
0930289234|5.0|I can see how this was a groundbreaking book when it came out. Simply amazing.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|This album was responsible for my learning arpeggio's on my guitar. I like poetry and Leonard Cohen's words and music, though not always understood somehow evoked emotions that inspired me to learn and play his songs. In trying to understand the words he wrote I found meanings in the songs that were my own, probably the basis of all good poetry. The music itself uses a lot of minor keys which emphsises sadness, reflections on those things lost, pain and the whole range of emotions associated with love. Still an easy listening cd.
0316017922|3.0|Very interesting reading, lost air in the last chapter.  Good airplane book, well written
B0011N1WE8|4.0|\\"Penelope\\" makes for an fun and interesting viewing experience. It is a modern take on the classic cursed princess fairy tale - here, Penelope [delightfully portrayed by Christina Ricci] is a rich heiress who is cursed with a pig snout for a nose. The curse can only be broken by marriage to a man who is from the same social class as Penelope. Many suitors are brought to the imposing family home, but all flee when they spy her deformity. One suitor, a gambler [played by James McAvoy] 'connects' with Penelope, but even he balks at marrying her and the dejected Penelope decides to run away to the big city and thus begins a fun adventure.<br /><br />This is a fun and heartwarming fairy tale with two very likable actors playing the leads. James McAvoy [who was s very dashing in Becoming Jane] is a bit slovenly in appearance here, but is charming nevertheless. Christina Ricci is adorable as the snout-faced Penelope and her chemistry with McAvoy is credible.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this whimsical tale to those who like quirky romances and fairy tales.
B001KMB6VE|1.0|I love Vin and I hate to trash this movie... but it stinks! It has no plot worth spending the time watching. Give this one a pass.
0385340990|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this book, and I can't say why except for the rather strange name. However, I am so glad that I picked this one up and read. What a delight!<br /><br />The story is told as a series of letters between an authoress, her publisher, best friend, and various new friends she meets via correspondence on the island of Guernsey. The time period is post-WWII, and people are just coming out from the aftermath of war and beginning to realize they can enjoy life once more. The island of Guernsey had been occupied by the Germans, and the inhabitants had suffered greatly being completely shut off from England along with enduring starvation and depleted supplies while living on an occupied island. Being re-connected with England, and the ability to once more have niceties in life seem almost surreal.<br /><br />The relationship that develops between the protagnist and the inhabitants on the island does seem unreal - when compared by modern standards. But this was 60 years ago, in a part of the world that had just suffered through - and survived - a devastating war. I believe people were ready to live again, to reconnect with each other again, if for nothing more than to prove they were alive and had survived.<br /><br />This book does have a lot of \\"fluff\\" to it, and that makes it an easy read. But it also a good read, an uplifting read, that leaves one feeling better about their fellow human than when they started it.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|A film directed by Billy Wilder and winner of 3 Academey Awards, this 1950 black and white remains as popular now as it was first released... Why? Because of the film's strange and alluring plot, and of course, the commanding performance from Gloria Swanson as the \\"has been\\" actress during Hollywood's transition from silent films to the talkies. To be sure, this transition ended alot of acting careers - many tried to make the transition, but most of the actors failed. This film brings this tragedy to life in the form of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a woman living wholly in the past, and her butler, (Eric Von Stroheim) protecting her from the outside world until the arrival of William Holden, a down and out screenwriter come relunctant gigilo, chased by the law.<br /><br />The famous scene of Desmond walking down the winding elaborate staircase as old star gone totally mad is worth the price of the product.<br /><br />Sunset Boulevard won the Academy Award for Best Story and Screenplay, Black and White Art Direction and Musical Score that only added to the film's overall madness.<br /><br />Sunset Boulevard really is the icon or representation for Hollywood's \\"findem' usem' and scrapem' machinery of the Hollywood film industry.<br /><br />Nothing but top notch filmmaking!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|This album is so groundbreaking, so beautiful, that everything else I have listened to since has been unable to move me the way music should. It is an album that encompasses profound sounds, thoughtful lyrics and danceable vibrations. When you first listen certain songs will stick out because of their catchy choruses, but alas, when you listen again, you see the greatness of each song.  And then still, when you read the lyrics, and listen AGAIN, new things will come to enlighten you. They sing of love, death, war, religion, and they sing with heart.  There are many great albums, but Neon Bible is arguably one of the best albums of all time! (p.s. Funeral is just as wonderful!).
B001ED7C5I|5.0|This is a good CD to listen to when its been a tough day, and i just want to have something to relax to.   The more i listen to it the more i like it.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Make no mistake about it the movie is absolute perfection.  Humor, action, kung fu, even a with a little drama thrown in, this movie is incredible.  Just a genius movie.  If a movie was made for blu ray this is it.  Needs more extras but the movie is perfect.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|For the third time this decade, Bruce Springsteen has teamed up with the E-Street Band for a studio album that attempts to recapture the glory days of Born to Run, The River and Born in the USA.  Once again, the effort comes up short, just as it did on Magic.  Bruce and the band sound great, but the fire and passion, not to mention the killer songs, just aren't there. The best moments on the album are the songs that find Springsteen leaning more towards his solo efforts such as The Wrestler and Outlaw Pete, which sounds something like the E-Street band backing Bruce on the Seger Sessions.  The majority of the music is more upbeat and optimistic than past efforts but it's never cloying or sentimental.  In the end, fans will walk away pleased with the album, but it fades from the memory quickly.  My advice:  Bruce needs to stop trying to recapture his Glory Days and let his artistic ambitions guide him.  It worked out pretty well on The Rising, Devils and Dust and The Seger Sessions. Springsteen is already a legend.  He shouldn't try so hard to remind us of that.
006135323X|4.0|I have read some of the other reviews, and I'm really surprised that people are so critical of this book.  It was entertaining and enlightening.  The premise is that humans often make poor decisions due to the cognitive biases that we are all susceptible to.  If you understand them, you can overcome them and improve your decision making.  He describes and interprets many experiments that he has done to shed light on these biases with a fun and enjoyable writing style.  I recommend it to anyone!
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|Great rifts, great singing, great lyrics ... everything I expected from this album and then some.  Epic.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I enjoyed every frame of this movie. It had everything and not jammed into a tight a little box.  It was a beautiful, perfectly paced, wonderful story.  I'm a huge Baz Luhrmann fan and this did not disappoint.  I was surprisingly shocked when the critics nearly panned this movie.  They are wrong.  If you love a good western, a good love story, a little bit of war thrown in and great acting, this is your film.  Slumdog Millionaire was good and Benjamin Button was interesting, but this is what going to the theater is all about, true movie magic.  Enjoy!
0553296981|5.0|The words of her diary were an invitation into her heart and soul, and, in such a short time, I felt as though I knew Anne personally. She had such a brilliant mind and a warm heart. Even though I knew how the story would end, when I finished it I wept bitterly. I had grown to love this little girl and nothing seemed as unfair as her demise. But I realized that through her death, she spoke for the millions of innocent people that died unknown. She was the epitomy of all the beauty that was destroyed in the holocaust. Anne was a martyr and she will be remembered here on earth and in heaven.
0452289963|4.0|I did like this book and it made me see things differently.  I could see myself in the pages.  Maybe we take things to much for granted and don't get in the moment. It helps you to understand some of the things that you do and teaches you to live in the moment. I guess at times we all need to set back and really see what we are doing. Some people will not like this book or what they see. Some might not be ready to hear what it has to say, but if you are ready to explore yourself and your life, then read this book.  I understood a lot about what I was doing and why.
B001CP4VMU|5.0|I just viewed this Blu-Ray and while its an improvement over the 2 Disc edition as far as picture ...its not as dramatic as I hoped for. That may be because the recent editions were pretty good or the source material being a couple decades old and very dark isn't  as suited toward  eye popping blu-ray results as more recent fair.  They've imported ALL the bonus features from  disc 2 on the previous 2 disc edition on the single disc. I have viewed the other 3 re-issues and the picture does improve with each so I am assuming they've done what they can with the first one.<br /><br />I purchased through amazon.co.uk for a scant 12 pounds, and it plays fine on my SONY blu-ray player...I don't believe there are region problems on these.
B00004LN16|4.0|This is a good album from AC/DC, though not one of their best it has some good songs and is worth buying to add to your collection.
B001CP4VNE|5.0|This movie looks much better than the initial Keaton Batman...on Blu-Ray. THey have imported over all the bonus features from the 2 disc DVD edition so this happily replaces that edition with improved picture and sound. I'm very pleased to have these on Blu-ray and  if you are a fan I can't  imagine you being disappointed. Like the first one its aspect ratio is 1:85 so it fills up your widescreen TV perfectly and from the Penguins nasty teeth to Catwomans red lips...Hi-def really makes this one  jump!    Purchased from amazon.co.uk for about 12 pounds..plays fine on my sony player.
B00008WT5M|5.0|This is AC/DC's second best album with Brian Johnson in my opinion, it features classics like Thunderstruck and Moneytalks, i guess it's just another under-rated masterpiece. Highly recommended.
1570629706|5.0|This is just a great little book. I read it in high school and wanted to read it again. It's not too long and very uplifting.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is an awesome album that features alot of awesome songs, their second best album with Bon Scott, a must have. Highly recommended.
B000FDVOXO|1.0|This extreme version will make you extremely upset you wasted your money.  It has DRM embedded!  Good luck getting the DVD ROM to play.  You have to jump thru hoop after hoop after hoop.  It says WM 9 but it's an outright lie.  You have to install Interactual player, THEN go their website and hunt for a license and then MAYBE it'll work. And if it does, you get only 5 days and then have to renew again!  Other than that, it really is a 5 star dvd of course.  But most would want this for the hd version and that deserves 1 star.  Better off getting the Blue Ray version if HD is all that important to you.
0930289234|3.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday.  He had been commenting on the movie commercials so I thought he would love this book.  He read it in 3 days!  He said it is a good book but he didn't like the ending.  I didn't read it so I'm not much help so I guess you have to read it yourself!
B0019M06JS|5.0|Eliane does not have a great voice, but it is very well suited to this beautiful music. It is so nice to listen to, so melodic, it gets into your head and won't let go.
0930289234|4.0|There's not much more I can add to any of the numerous other reviews which summarize the story itself. Is this 'the greatest graphic novel\\" of all time? That can only be determined by each indivudual or through a voting process. For me, it certainly ranks in the top three. The artwork for the time stood out from the rest of the comic industry and the characters are recognizable as some form of DC Comics regular characters. Comparing the artwork to current comics, yes it has fallen behind but there's something deeply nostalgic about it still. I think the writing is overrated but still several notches above most recent contributions to the industry.<br /><br />The evolution of the masked adventurer / crimefighter presented here is interest enough to get you into the story. There are elements I could have lived without such as the sub-story double talk of the Pirate Comic but without it would the book have truly been hurt? The interaction of the characters and the plot twist reveals push the story along. You'll obviously like some characters more than others and the ending... well, initially I didn't like it but I understand how it is probably better this way. After a few days of surmising and going back to re-examine the ending, I think some alternatives could have been implemented but fully 'get' why it needed to be this way.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the read and re-read. Some will claim it's the best ever, others will claim it's crap. I claim it is a strong story, smooth flow, and stands up to the test of time.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Not as great as Goodfellas, but quite a good mob movie. My only negative is that the movie is a bit long. But Stone, De Niro and Pesci are great. Check out the suits worn by De Niro.............he had some Vegas style!

B001IB63KQ|5.0|Paramore is a great live band, and you can see why in The Final Riot!  Not only does it contain live concert footage, but interspersed with the songs are clips of the band as it travels around the country.  It's genuinely funny and a great insight into life on tour.
0316017922|5.0|I am early on in this book but the connections and realizations Malcolm make are overwhelming myself at an early age was deemed to need more attention to learning how to read.  In actuality my deficiency stemmed from the fact my family moved states and in one state they taught kids to read at a later age than the one I moved too.  This situation led me to be marginalized to a level of education that wasn't as challenging and I had to prove myself to be promoted to higher level classes but the time my peers spent learning at that higher level left me with more of a challenging environment to compete.  I eventually became an A student went to a top University and have a masters degree but at times I have struggled to hold my own with my peers and I can only suspect that some of what Malcolm points out in his book applied to me.  This book made me cry it staggers my mind to think the times I felt inadequate about my abilities and perhaps my situation was really due to the circumstance of poor timing in my relocation.

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I originally gave this album 1 star because I was originally disappointed.  I still am not as wowed by this album as by their previous albums, but it is listenable.  In fact, I have been listening to it for a week or so now and do actually enjoy it.  So, I am changing it from one star to two stars.  I do not feel it is as inspired as the other albums, for that reason the sort of low rating.
031606792X|5.0|LOVED IT!!! Worth every cent (especially if you like to keep your books). This is a hardcover and stays new even after you read it.
B000CCIVDO|2.0|I bought these to listen to music on my iPod, work computer, and to block out background noise.    These headphones do sound very good. I haven't a lot of experience with completely closed type sets, but the bass response is reasonable without becoming muddy. The highs are clear and the mids are smooth. However, if you are a hard core bass-head, they are pretty easy to over-drive. I think the overall sound quality is very good for the price.    The major caveat? They are extremely uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. For some reason the manufacturer chose to omit a hinge that would enable the phones to pivot where they meet the headband. If you notice, their less expensive sets have this feature. This design choice results in difficulty adjusting the phones to lie flat against your ears. Once you do, the smallness of the cups cause discomfort where they touch your ears.    It is hard to recommend these to anyone but those with the smallest of ears, despite the good sound quality.    I am going to give the 2000 series with a pivoting hinge a shot, instead.
0634086782|5.0|I had my reservations with this article. I am the kind of guy that loves when books have a nice presentation. It inspires me to take action. All the lessons are carefully explained. I am learning a lot from this book. I´ve found that the ilustrations are awesome and the style of encyclopedia learning is cool.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures might be Rush's best album.  Certainly a lot of fans think it is.  To me, this album was the last album of \\"old\\" Rush, a period of time from 1974 to 1981 when their music was heavier and had at least one song that was at least 9 or 10 minutes long.  On this album there are only 7 songs, but all are outstanding.  The song Tom Sawyer is probably the signature song of Rush.  Great lyrics, synths, and guitar, not to mention bass and drums.  All three members of Rush always contribute equally to an album and how the songs sound.  Nobody is ever really underrepresented.  Nobody dominates.  All three members are so talented.  They might be the most talented group in history, other than Led Zeppelin.  The next songs on the album are instantly recognizable.  Red Barchetta, YYZ, Limelight.  Classics.  Then The Camera Eye, a 10+ minute song about New York City.  Witch Hunt is dark and terrifying and atmospheric.  A great song.  The album closes with Vital Signs, one of my favorite Rush songs ever.  The drumming is awesome in this song and Alex Lifeson's guitar is as well.  Geddy Lee is brilliant on bass.  When I listen to this album, I think of it as an album where the three members of Rush are showing off.  That is, they know they're good and they're letting the world know it.  A song like YYZ is a perfect example.  All three members get to showcase their outstanding musical abilities on this instrumental song.  It's as if they take turns having the spotlight on them as the song progresses.  If I was that good, I'd do the same thing.  Another thing I notice about this album (and all of Rush's material) is how good their timing is.  They are always perfectly in sync.  Not even a fraction of a second off timing.  Get this album.  It is a Rush classic that every fan should have.

1582701709|1.0|Everybody was raving about this book, including Oprah, so I had to read it. It's a bunch of BS and not grounded in reality. For example, the Secret teaches you how to reduce your bills and start getting checks magically in the mail. The book tells you to imagine that all your bills are checks, and when your \\"checks\\" (which are really bills) come in the mail, add a 0 to the \\"check\\" to make it seem like you have more money, and then pay the bills with gratitude.    Suuuuuree. Tell your landlord or the bill collector that you're not paying him this month, instead, you will just show your gratitude. See how far that gets you.    Also, this book tries to be deep but is really shallow. It thinks the good life is having a big house, a new car, and doing hedonistic things. It keeps telling users to visualize themselves in a dream home, driving a nice car, and eating salami sandwiches. This is all that's wrong with society, not what's right.    The book says that you are a representation of all that you have thought about in the past. Then tells you to forget about the past.    What world is the author living on?    I do get the central premise of the book which is \\"you are what you think.\\" A book 100x better than this is \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napolean Hill. It's much more credible and based in reality. Not spacey like this book.    Don't read this book for life-changing advice. Read it if you want to know what everybody else is talking about. Read \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" or \\"The Psychology of Winning\\" for more grounded, solid advice.
B0018AVNKC|4.0|As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.<br /><br />WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!<br /><br />STOP-MOTION = CREEPY<br />If you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  \\"Coraline\\" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.<br /><br />TAKING A STEP BACK FROM \\"CORPSE BRIDE\\"<br />In my humble opinion \\"Corpse Bride\\" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, \\"Corpse Bride\\" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  \\"Coraline\\" takes a slight step back from \\"Corpse Bride\\" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, \\"Coraline\\" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting \\"Corpse Bride\\" standards.<br /><br />MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF \\"CORPSE BIRDE\\"<br />Where \\"Coraline\\" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  \\"Coraline\\" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In \\"Coraline\\" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this \\"cheating\\", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.<br /><br />ACTORS WHO DON'T SING<br />\\"Coraline\\" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during \\"Corpse Bride\\".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the \\"Stepford Wives\\" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT THE STORY \\"GEEK-MIAS\\"?<br />I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.<br />WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.<br />SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.<br />DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.<br />THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  \\"Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!\\"  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.<br /><br />LIKE THE CHILDREN OF \\"HAMLIN\\", I'M HOOKED<br />Though not reaching the heights that \\"Corpse Bride\\" did, \\"Coraline\\" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the \\"Pied Piper of Hamlin\\" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.  For fans of stop-motion, it's a reason to smile.<br /><br />-Story...............4 Stars<br />-Animation..........4.5 Stars<br />-Characters..........4.5 Stars<br />-Family Appeal...3 Stars<br /><br />Total.....3.87 Starstasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.

0930289234|5.0|I am an avid reader but this was my first graphic novel.  I had just finished \\"Cavalier and Clay\\" by Michael Chabon which centered around the comic book industry in the '30s and '40s.  When The Watchmen was touted as one of the most important novels of the last century, I figured that this was a 'comic book' worth trying.  I was more than pleasantly surprised by the art and depth of the plot; but most surprising was the character development.  Usually science fiction and mystery writers focus on the plot and leave the character development behind; The Watchmen didn't.  The variety of characters created a rich backdrop for the plot and the uniqueness of the whole structure of the novel worked very well instead of being an annoying device.  I am now recommending this book to all my reader friends and it will be my choice for my book club on my next turn.  My bookshelves are full and need some weeding, but The Watchmen will be staying put.[[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]]
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Loved the music!  Thought the movie stars did a pretty good job!  Play it lots and lots!
B001N44BVQ|1.0|It's amazing that such talent can be assembled and such garbage produced. A disparate disconnected mess of  vignettes strung together and all going nowhere. This is a bandwagon film that rides on the whole 9/11 middle east terror news of the day. Insert the Russians, martians, or any such enemy and it's the same junk different day. The cookie cutter techno babble main titles that have been so overused that my dog has seen it too often was my first clue this film was going to be a mess. Insert gunplay, explosions, and the desert, car chases and you can watch this film 1/2 asleep and still write a thesis on it. The attempt at layering in some sort of base moral message into this mess makes it even more ridiculous.  there must be a thousand films like this already made and at least a hundred that do it better.  Very disappointed.  Ugh!
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I love this cd.  There are a few different artists on some of the tracks that actually add flavor to the album overall.

B0016OMFPW|5.0|Kudos to the Roy Hargrove quintet for this masterful and superior recording.  Hargrove and his \\"earfood\\" practitioners have given us thirteen exemplary and accessible tracks that beg to be heard again and again.  The quintet's cohesiveness creates the kind of fervor heard in Kind of Blue, i.e. passionate jazz played by passionate stewards of jazz.  Undeniably exquisite jazz, wholly expressive and accessible, and absolutely beautiful.The rhythm section provides stellar accompaniment for Hargrove's melodic interpretations, and had this recording been issued during the heyday of jazz, it most certainly would be considered a classic today. Transcendent.  Unquestionably. Prepare yourself for unsurpassed beauty. As \\"jazz goes\\", this is a gem of enlightened elegance. Bravo!
B001NY42KQ|4.0|It's spring, and the Wildcats are facing the last few weeks of their high school career.  Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu) are leading East High's basketball team in another championship game.  But their final minutes of playing basketball are only the first of the many finals they will face.<br /><br />And as our characters face saying goodbye, they have to start dealing with the future.  Troy and Chad have been accepted at the local university to play ball.  But Troy isn't sure he wants to.  His girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) is going to Stanford.  In fact, she is considering their early admission program, which would mean she would have to leave early.<br /><br />But it's a chance to do one last show together that truly brings everyone together.  While they prepare a show about their hopes for the future and the pain of saying goodbye, the group finds out that scouts from Julliard are going to be there to consider composer Kelsi (Olesya Rulin), choreographer Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel), star Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), or Troy for one spot and a scholarship.  Who will get it?  Does Troy want it?  And how will he and Gabriella ever say goodbye?<br /><br />Now if you are looking for a realistic movie, turn back now.  This is a G rated Disney musical, for pete's sake.  But it is still fun.<br /><br />This movie focused a bit too much on the songs.  The plot was a little too loose and predictable, making it just an excuse to string some songs together.  The good news is, those songs are fun, with several hummable, toe tapping numbers.  And the choreography was amazing.  Several of the songs involved multiple locations and costume changes.  This is a big screen musical for movie musical lovers.  I especially loved the number in the junkyard.<br /><br />Frankly, I wish this movie were about 20 minutes longer.  They could have used the time to give us more with the supporting players.  Heck, cutting out one of Troy and Gabriella's three love duets would have allowed for that, too.  I really have loved the entire cast of these things.<br /><br />Speaking of casts, three sophomores are introduced here to lead the next installment in the franchise.  Honestly, I didn't care for any of them.  Hopefully, when they become leads they will be better developed as characters.<br /><br />While the entire series has had a helping of cheese, this one did feel a bit more over the top when it came to the graduation scene.  Surely, they could have found some other way to handle that one.<br /><br />But if all this sounds like I didn't like the movie, think again.  I found it somewhere between the first and second in the series.  I was smiling the entire time.  There are a couple in jokes, so do watch these movies in order to catch them.<br /><br />This was designed to be the last we'll see of the original cast (until the inevitable High School Reunion Musical in 10 years).  Honestly, that makes me sad.  This send off will certainly please the franchises many fans.too.  I really have loved the entire cast of these things.

B001JNNDGA|5.0|I have many blu-ray's and was excited when i saw that The Passion was finally coming to blu-ray! I was not disappointed, although it looks mildly different, you can see every nook and cranny. It looks amazing. It is a little grainy at times, but it doesn't steal the show like other blu-ray titles i have! I would definitely recommend this title to any one wanting to see a great movie on their big screen tv's. Definately don't pass this up!
B001J8NRDY|4.0|Years ago as a teen when I first started to play classical guitar I came across pieces from composers like Sor, Carcassi and my favourite Giuliani that were titled \\"Study\\".  I didn't get it at that time and I was wondering why these guys were telling me to go study and not learn their pieces.  Thankfully, I grew older and hopefully wiser and I understood that these were pieces that the composer put together to emphasise and explore certain aspects of music theory that interested them and to learn from.<br /><br />What has this got to do with \\"Remain In Light?\\"  Well, this is the impression I get when I listen to this album as it seems to me to be just a study on various interesting rhythms.  Admittedly on first hearing I couldn't get this album but once it dawned upon me that this was a Talking Head \\"Study\\", I realised that I had approached listening to this album in the \\"wrong\\" way just as you'd \\"listen\\" to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" differently from say any Britney Spears album; the expectations are different.<br /><br />Once I went back to \\"correct\\" my expectations of what and how I should approach listening to this album, I realised that the song titles and lyrics except perhaps for the obligatory \\"hit\\" single \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" were about as useful as Paula Abdul as a judge on \\"American Idol\\".  All that matters is the music and the \\"study\\" of rhythms and in this way, many of the tracks reminds me of that other great \\"study\\" album \\"New Gold Dream\\" by Simple Minds.  The way to \\"listen\\" to this album is the same way you'd listen to that aforementioned Pink Floyd classic which is to relax, close your eyes and let the excellent rhythms permeate your body.  By the third listen, I was hooked and I could tell that this is a classic album that does indeed grow on you and is a real treat for serious fans of various styles of music.<br /><br />The downer about this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the album though is the poor quality of the design which is assembled using very thin cardboard that looks like it will come apart soon once the glue gets old and hence as far as mlps designs go this one is really very poor.  The sound quality is very good though and is the sole redeeming quality other than the song content which is above reproach.  Even the extra tracks are good and which is rarely the case with other albums actually adds to the overall listening enjoyment of the album:<br /><br />9.  Fera's Riff (Unfinished Outtake)<br />10. Unison (Unfinished Outtake)<br />11. Double Groove (Unfinished Outtake)<br />12. Right Start (Unfinished Outtake)<br /><br />Also included is a 16-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />Overall this is an expensive version of an otherwise unique and classic study of rhythm that like a true classic grows on you and improves with every listen although you will need to justify the value for money of this baby for yourselves as the mlps design isn't that great either.<br /><br />Great sound and song quality, poor mlps design.board that looks like it will come apart soon once the glue gets old and hence as far as mlps designs go this one is really very poor.

B001ED7C58|3.0|In her website, Stephanie Meyer describes how she used music to get inspiration while writing the Twilight saga.  Though this soundtrack was specifically put together for the movie, it includes many of the bands and songs she list as her inpiration.  If you want to experience the emotional tone and the music of Twilight, this is the CD to have.  \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" and Rob Pattinson \\"Never Think\\" are my favorite songs, but each song has a charm of its own.
B000021XS0|5.0|My prog rock roots are based in Rush, Pink Floyd, Yes, and Queensryche, and Dream Theater has been a relatively recent find for me. Just enough of a musician to know how incredibly talented this entire band really is. I was very impressed with Awake and Images and Words, but I have to say that IMHO this album is superior. Two major reasons for this: 1) love the single theme/story connecting the entire album. This is hard to do well, but when it works (like Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime or Pink Floyd's Dark Side and Wall), it makes for a fantastic listening experience, where the music and lyrics draw you into a deep, emotionally-charged fantasy; and 2) more so than the other two albums, I love the blend of ballads and rockers. The range of song writing and performance is excellent, and creates an engaging experience from start to finish. Also looking forward to trying out other bands like Riverside and Porcupine Tree, but this album has set the bar very high for me.
B000UD08HW|2.0|I am and will always be a huge fan of David Gilmour and his work; that's why I gave this title 2 stars. The performance of \\"Echoes\\" was stellar. David Bowie in \\"Arnold Layne\\" was brilliant.   Not so good: First, the video quality is horrible at points. Not a videophile but it is really bad.  Second, David's execution is lacking at some points, almost like, \\"lets just get through this one so I can go back to the hotel\\". And lastly, David Bowie singing in \\"Comfortably Numb\\" was just downright painful.     Skip this title and wait for Gdansk to come out on Blue-Ray.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The sound quality is excellent, they are extremely lightweight and comfortable.  Great for jogging and such as they are light enough that the headband easily keeps them in place.  Ear buds always fall out or are uncomfortable.  These are on the cheap side (durability).  I need to replace them every 6 to 12 months due to a break in the wire at the speaker.  But at the price, it's been worth it.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I thought HSM 3 was an awesome movie. The acting and songs were amazing. I am just sad to see an excellent triology come to an end.    In high school musical 3 you get to see all of the emotions and changes that happen during senior year. You get to see Troy and Gabriella's relationship progress, you get to see what everyone's future is going to be, you get to see prom (Troy and Gabriella look amazing and so does the rest of the class), you get to see everyone graduate, and you get to see everyone say goodbye to each other which was really sad. There are some really hard decisions to be made in this movie and I think everyone did an excellent job acting it out.    Overall this movie was great. It was played out really well. When you are watching this movie you really feel like you are also saying goodbye to the cast and its really sad.    I wish the entire cast good luck with everything they do in the future.    If you love the first two high school musical films then I know you'll love this one as well.    The Extended version of the film comes with an extended version of the film, sing alongs, cast interviews, bloopers and so much more. I highly recommend you pick up the extended version of the film instead of the theatrical version. It is well worth the extra money.

B001N44BVQ|5.0|I have been awaiting the release of this dramatic action thriller directed by Ridley Scott and Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crow for a long time and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays a C.I.A. agent in the middle east who is trying to collect intelligence and is running into twists and turns around every corner. DiCaprio's performance is outstanding. You completely forget who he is and become immersed as him as a C.I.A. agent who is undercover. This is quite an acting job considering that he is the furthest thing from that. He has the grizzled appearance of someone undercover and his scenes are so strong and commanding that he doesn't have that baby boy aspect to him that I've seen in other of his pictures. His was an Oscar worthy performance.<br /><br />There is the eye in the sky tracking DiCaprio by camera from above as he goes about his seemingly rouge missions for the C.I.A. Russell Crowe plays the older C.I.A. family man who is in contact with Ferris (DiCaprio) as he walks the minefield that is intelligence gathering in the middle east. Crowe is absorbed in his daily life in America and seemingly is oblivious to the hardships and deadly consequences that Ferris is facing. This is an understated role for Crowe who also very good performance. He does not look at all like that same man who played The Gladiator. And I think this is the most relaxed character I've seen him play yet.<br /><br />This film was expertly directed by Ridley Scott to the point that at times I felt as if I were there. You can almost feel the sand in your lungs and the stink of death and open air markets as you feast your eyes on this gem.<br /><br />Although I'm not typically an action movie man this one reeled me in because you really didn't know what was next around the corner. The action scenes are great, by the way, even though that's not why I pick movies to watch.<br /><br />This is a great movie and if you like the actors, director, and genre of this film then it is a definite for you to watch.<br />I give it all five stars and will watch it again.<br />Kevin W.

B001C4CI8A|3.0|I found much to like in this modern espionage thriller set smack dab in the middle of the struggle of our times with high tech spies battling 7th Century jihadists who have found and exploited the weaknesses of that same technology, bending it to their own ends.    It's a Ridley Scott film, which means superb craftsmanship, and has an excellent cast with DiCaprio and Crowe in the lead, but I think both are trumped by Mark Strong's Hani, the sophisticated and cultured head of Jordanian Intelligence, who delivers the film's best moments, as well as its sub-theme that technology cannot replace human intelligence in the struggle against jihadists.    The technology presented is stunning if it is truly that advanced.  But the real espionage war is presented as down and dirty in the trenches.  There are some side trips with DiCaprio's interest in a young Muslim nurse, but these are thinly developed and mostly it is a fast paced action thriller, with some nice details.    I was troubled by the Russell Crowe character.  While duplicity and bureaucratic back-stabbing are certainly part of life in the CIA as in any large organization, a boss that constantly undercuts and double crosses you would not inspire much confidence and loyalty, and I don't think would rise to such a position of power.  Sure, he might do dirt to rivals in the office, but to constantly lie to and subvert the field operatives that risk their lives for you seems an unlikely path for career advancement. No one would work for you.  But what do I know?    All in all, a gritty and fast paced entertainment.  Like some other reviewers, I didn't find any great revelations here, but it was good movie-making done well and it was worth a look.

B001P5HI4A|5.0|Love this movie, as I do ALL of Barbra's films.  One disc, two discs, who cares, as long as it is out and we can finally see it on DVD.  I swear, PEOPLE aren't happy unless they have something to complain about.  Get over it, get a life and shut-up and just enjoy a wonderful movie.  Luckily for us, it is a two disc set with fabulous extras.  Barbra, you've done it again, you've made me a very happy man and I'm sure many others feel the same.  This film is beautiful, brilliant and Streisand is spectacular.  End scene!
B00164IV9G|3.0|Five very likable couples that have some connection to one another traverse the choppy waters of romance in Baltimore. That's the short of the new romantic comedy - drama \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\". And it is an interesting, if entirely unoriginal idea. But the filmmakers take some good, interesting elements and make the story funnier and more enjoyable than it has a right to be.<br /><br />In a film like this, with so many characters, a film attempting to make light of and dramatize the many aspects of romance, you know that every character is going to have one aspect of a personality. There are simply too many people for the writers and director to be able to delve into any of the characters in any depth. When the writers and directors have the skill to create more than a few real life, fully rounded, believable characters, you know you are in the hands of people with real talent. Usually, the end result is something magical. \\"He's Just Not...\\" is not magical, but it has a few funny moments. And these moments are made all the more enjoyable by the likable cast.<br /><br />Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) are very much in love and have been together for seven years. But Beth wants to get married and Neil doesn't believe in it. Can Beth accept the status of their relationship and continue on, or will she jeopardize the relationship by insisting on marriage? Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly) are married, but aren't particularly happy. Janine seems to be more interested in renovating their house. When Ben meets Anna (Scarlett Johannson), a yoga teacher who wants to be a singer, he finds an undeniable attraction to her. But he doesn't want to jeopardize his marriage. But what if Anna is the love of his life? Mary (Drew Barrymore) works at ad sales for Baltimore's gay weekly and gets most of her dating advice from her gay co-workers. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), the film's guide, goes on a blind date with Conor (Kevin Connolly), a realtor. She is sure he will call back, but he is more interested in going out with Anna, a girl he is clearly infatuated with. Distraught, Gigi decides to visit a spot Conor told her he hangs out at, a restaurant owned by Alex (Justin Long), a womanizer who is also Conor's friend. He likes Gigi and decides to become her romantic guide.<br /><br />So, it's all very predictable. But director Ken Kwapis (who has recently been directing episodes of \\"The Office\\") and writers Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein manage to generate a few laughs and make most of the characters at least interesting.<br /><br />But all of this good will begins to evaporate. And evaporate very quickly. With five different 'couples', we have five different and distinct story lines. Yes, they overlap, but not a lot. So the film sets up a Round Robin-type of exposition. First we meet all five couples and learn why they are in this Rom Com Dram. The very broad strokes. Then, we start to explore their lives with them, delving deeper into the problems. Then we revisit them. Unfortunately, a lot of these 'visits' start to become very repetitive. A couple has an argument and then breaks up. We see the male living out of the apartment. We see the female unhappy. Will they get back together? Of course. But we have to sit through a number of scenes of each of them unhappy. What about Janine's discovery that Ben might be smoking. First, she accuses Ben. When he denies it, she turns to their foreman (Luis Guzman). She seems to accept the mystery of the cigarettes, but every time we see her, she either mentions them or looks at them or talks about them. This is used to illustrate the state of their relationship, but it really just illustrates the state of our fatigue at sitting in the theater for so long. Conor pursues Anna and wants to have a committed relationship with her. But she is attracted to Ben. And he can't sleep with her because it would affect his marriage. These three circle each other, engaging in variousconversations. Soon, it really seems like some scenes are being repeated, almost verboten. And it becomes a chore to sit through the film.<br /><br />A big part of the problem is the film is too long. Way too long, by like 30 or 40 minutes. At 129 minutes (it seems longer), this romantic comedy/ drama has too much time on its hands giving it the luxury to rehash stories and ideas we have already seen. If the film were, say, 90 minutes, a lot of this repetition would be impossible and the film would seem funnier (because the laughs would be more closely spaced together) and overall better (because everything would move at a faster pace.<br /><br />Producer Drew Barrymore and her business partner Nancy Juvonen are smart producers. Adapting a 'self-help' book in to a fictional romantic comedy/ drama seems like an iffy proposition at best. But they clearly saw that it could work and adapting the former mega bestseller into a movie has now created a hugely popular movie going experience. Barrymore and Juvonen are also behind the \\"Charlie's Angels\\" films. So, they clearly recognize material that will draw people to the multiplex. It's too bad they can't recognize quality material and bring better films to the same legions of people so willing to drop $10 for a movie ticket.<br /><br />Throughout the film, there are a number of moments when the screen flashes a line, presumably a bon mote of self-help gleamed from the bestseller. Then, we watch as a random person tells a quick story about their romantic life meant to illustrate this statement. Why are random people talking to us? Some of these moments are funny, but wouldn't it be a better idea to use the well-known actors you already have in the film for these moments? It would also help to make us more familiar with these same characters as we would get another little glimpse into their characters. Too bad. A wasted opportunity. As they stand, these moments only serve to make the film seem even longer.<br /><br />\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" is a good date movie. But I would really recommend renting it on DVD and forcing your boyfriend to watch it with you at home. He will quickly become so bored he will agree to do anything for you. You could probably get him to clean the house, bake a pie, run the vacuum.

B001P3SA94|3.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />1. A poor white guy has a girlfriend and has Big Dreams. He starts out as a junkyard owner and then moves into nightclub work. After his club burns down, he is able to put his money into what became Chess records.<br /><br />2. He signs a bunch of earthy, gritty black musicians from various places who make some hit singles.<br /><br />3. Said black musicians just have tons of problems through which Chess helps them all. These problems form a big chunk of the movie.<br /><br />4. The label signs Etta James (later in the movie) and she has a drug addiction and sells everything in the house.<br /><br />5. Chess finally sells the label (for whatever reason) and then dies.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />1. One unintended benefit of this movie was to show that color had NOTHING TO DO with why these musicians stayed broke so often. They were up singing and grinning every night and seemed to not be able to count very well. And had nothing to show for all their hard work. (Contrast this with someone as canny as Ray Charles.) These people were driving around in Cadillacs and flat broke.<br /><br />2. The plot was enough to keep me interested-- if only to find out how many inaccurate things I could spot. The acting was decent and earthy --although I wonder if Muddy Waters  ever really sounded like that in real life (like he had a mouth full of hay after gargling with sulfuric acid). I sure haven't seen any interviews where he sounded like that. Those Southern accents were also a bit over the top. (Oh the irony of black actors in a movie doing bad black accents.)<br /><br />3. There was not nearly as much information in this movie as there *could* have been, and that is probably the weakest point.<br /><br />Inaccuracies:<br /><br />1. Little Walter DID NOT die on the floor of Muddy Water's house.<br /><br />2. The film made us believe that Chuck Berry was jailed ONLY for having sex with an underage girl. It turns out that he had a criminal record from before and had been in the hoosegow before. So, what might have been a probation or a lighter sentence turned into a heavier sentence because of recidivism. And apparently he was a slooooow learner. He went to jail *again* in the 70s for tax evasion.<br /><br />3. This one is questionable. Was Etta James' mother really a prostitute? I've not been able to find anything to that effect.<br /><br />4. Leonard Chess did not fall dead right after selling his label, but three months later.<br /><br />5. Was Etta James *ever* as slim and attractive as Beyonce Knowles? All the photos in which I've ever seen her (no matter what age) show her as short and, um, rubenesque. (At one point, she was 400 pounds-- and under six feet.)<br /><br />6. The narrator referred to where some of the characters were initially working as \\"plantations.\\" Um, sorry, but two things: 1) Plantations were about 100 years before the action of this movie; 2) No single character in the movie was old enough to have been born on a plantation or into slavery. The accurate word was \\"sharecroppers,\\" but I guess that was a small detail that was lost.<br /><br />Final verdict:<br /><br />This is worth a matinee fare or a rental off the New Releases shelf. It was interesting (for a first watch), but not worth more than a single movie ticket (as in, not enough for a date).ence turned into a heavier sentence because of recidivism.

B0018AVNKC|5.0|Every so often, you see a film so special, so different, you can't help but count the moments until the film officially becomes a Classic. Such is the case with \\"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas\\". Tim Burton, working with director Henry Selick, conceived a story so unique and original, most people were instantly transfixed and captivated by the new characters and the magical quality of the film. The film has rightfully earned the title of  \\"Classic\\", enjoying limited re-release every year near Halloween. Disneyland transforms the Haunted Mansion every year, inviting Jack Skellington, Zero, Oogie Boogie and Sandy Claus to make appearances throughout the venerable ride. A couple of years ago, the film was converted to 3-D, and now it is a very different experience to see the film in theaters. It is, of course, also available on DVD. Burton and Selick followed \\"Nightmare\\" with an adaptation of Roald Dahl's \\"James and the Giant Peach\\". It's very good, but not really a classic.<br /><br />A number of years later, each of the director's made a new entry in the stop- motion animation genre. Tim Burton, working with another director, created \\"Corpse Bride\\". And Selick chose to make the live action - stop motion hybrid called \\"Monkeybone\\" starring Brendan Fraser and Whoopi Goldberg, among many others.<br /><br />Both of these films lack a crucial element making the material flawed, at best, and downright awful at worst. What is that crucial element? The other half of the team. In \\"Corpse Bride\\", Burton's unique visual style is fully evident and the film is stunning visually. This is really no surprise for a Tim Burton film. All of his films have a stunning, fable like visual quality. But like all of Burton's films, \\"Corpse Bride\\" really falters in the storytelling. \\"Monkey Bone\\" is, quite simply, a dreadful film. Selick clearly can't guide the human actors as well as he can a puppet and all of the acting is dreadful. Considering the stop motion animation is relegated to a supporting role in this film, the worst part of the film takes center stage.<br /><br />Now, both directors are returning with new stop motion animation projects. Selick returns as writer and director of \\"Coraline\\", based on a book by Neil Gaiman, and presented in 3-D. Burton teams with Timur Babmenetkov, director of the Russian films \\"Night Watch\\" and \\"Day Watch\\", to bring us \\"9\\", a film that appears to be about robot figures trying to rebuild a post-apocalyptic Earth. It will be released on 9-9-09.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\", written and directed by Selick, is as close to a magical film as I have seen in a number of years. I would definitely recommend seeking out a theater showing the film in 3-D. The film doesn't contain a lot of 3-D tricks, hands and objects flying at the screen so the audience will have the effect of the item flying at them, and 3-D isn't necessary to enjoy the film, but it adds such a depth to the story and the visuals that I can only imagine the film would be completely different without the 3-D glasses. The backgrounds and characters seem to belong in the real world and we get to experience a little of this thanks to the addition of 3-D.<br /><br />Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman, \\"The Daily Show withy Jon Stewart\\") move to a new apartment in a dreary old building in the middle of a large field almost completely devoid of both color and plant life. Bored, Coraline tries to get her parents to go on a walk, or to play with her, to do anything, But they are both so busy writing their new gardening catalog (and each hates touching dirt) that they start to get upset with her for being a nuisance. She decides to explore the house and the grounds and soon meets Whybie, the grandson of Coraline's new landlord. As she continues to explore, she meets the elderly British sisters, Miss Forcible and Miss Spink (Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders), former vaudevillians, who live upstairs and a former Russian gymnast, Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane, HBO's \\"Deadwood\\", \\"Deathrace\\") who lives downstairs. She soon finds a small door behind some wallpaper. It's locked, but her annoyed mom is only too glad to open it, anything to stop her daughter from nagging. As Coraline peers inside. She finds a passageway to a parallel world. In this new world, her mom and dad are very attentive and loving, seeking to entertain her all the time. The apartment is bright and colorful. The gardens are overgrown with colorful flowers. A little Scottish Terrier (Keith David) talks. It seems like everything in this new world is designed to make her happy. All Coraline has to do to make her stay in this world permanent is to adapt to it completely and make herself look just like everyone else. And everyone else has black buttons sewn in where their eyes should be.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\", based on a book by Neil Gaiman, has a dark, fairy tale quality that really helps to set it apart, to make it a little special. All of the best animated films and the best fairy tales are at least a little dark. All of Roald Dahl's children's books have a slightly sinister quality to them; parents die leaving children in strange circumstances or children find escape in slightly sinister adults. Gaiman borrows this quality, bringing a darkness to Coraline's world, both literally and figuratively. Coralline has both of her parents, but she maybe wishes she didn't because all they seem to care about is work leaving her to entertain herself.<br /><br />When the Jones family moves into their new apartment, Coraline is shocked to find everything so dark and gray and devoid of character. The entire apartment building appears to have seen no sunlight in decades, everything in covered in a gray pallor. When she goes outside to explore, an overcast sky prompts her to wear a rain slicker. But the area looks so devoid of life we have to wonder if the sun has taken a permanent vacation from the area. When she meets Whybie, he doesn't seem to realize there is an alternative because he is so used to the barren landscape.<br /><br />As in any fable, there has to be an alternative, either good or bad. And in \\"Coraline\\", the alternative initially appears very good to the little girl. She follows a secret passageway and ends up in a complete copy of her apartment. It is exactly the same in every way except that it is colorful, furnished with comfortable, homey furnishings and her parents seem particularly intent on making sure their daughter is having fun. In other words, she recognizes it because it is the same, but she is shocked because it is so completely different. She also finds that animals talk in this new world, plants grow and seem to perform and her mom seems particularly interested in making sure her daughter is happy. But as the poster for the film says, \\"Be careful what you wish for\\".<br /><br />Selick and his team do an amazing job of giving each character a distinctive look and personality. And this attention to detail continues throughout every aspect of the environment and story. As Coraline explores the family's new apartment, she looks very large in hallways and small and insignificant in some of the huge, high ceiling rooms. It is a nice way of illustrating how foreign the environment is to her, how much she feels like an alien in these new surroundings.<br /><br />The large Victorian that houses her family's new apartment is also particularly dark, spooky and unwelcoming. So when Coraline enters the alternative world and everything is painted in deep, but vibrant colors, and everyone seems so welcoming, she dives into the new world.<br /><br />Not only are her parents very different, but her neighbors are also different. Whybie tries to warn her, but soon, he appears with buttons as eyes and seems much more complacent. Coraline finds a theater in the building and watches an extended performance by the British sisters, the highlight of which is a reenactment of \\"The Birth ofVenus\\" by the two women and one of the very buxom sisters appears wearing nothing but some pasties and a very small bikini bottom.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" has much to discover that I could go on for pages and pages, but that would ruin a lot of the fun. It is better for you to discover it on your own.<br /><br />I will say that I think \\"Coraline\\" is a great film for families with kids over a certain age. The film has some dark elements that might scare some younger kids and even though this is an animated film, if you take very young kids to see it, you'll only have to leave the theater early when they get scared. I know some parents have difficulty taking their kids to films like \\"Curious George\\". If this is you, stay away from \\"Coraline\\". But if your kids are, oh, at least 10, this is a great choice for the whole family because there is something for everyone to enjoy and delight in.<br /><br />I hope this film quickly earns the title it deserves allowing it to be enjoyed by generations to come.is so used to the barren landscape.

B001LPWGE6|2.0|Bourne Supremacy: This is the one all the critics panned because of the \\"shaky camera syndrome\\" of director Greengrass. The effort to make the audience uncomfortable during the more exciting sequences fails miserably, I'm not the only critic to say so. If \\"Identity\\" director Liman had stayed in charge, the production values might have been retained. (There is even a parody of the \\"shaky camera syndrome\\" in \\"Ocean's Twelve\\" when Damon comes on screen.) Likewise unfortunate was Greengrass' camera work in \\"Ultimatum\\" ... but the shaky work is minimized to the actual action sequences.

B001L5SXQG|4.0|Some poeple feel the opening song, \\"Outlaw Pete\\", to be a strange song, and I thought the same for a while. But then I realized, it was just another piece of Bruce's Americana. And it sets up the rest of the album nicely. While the title track may be the weakest, the album is filled with songs that traverse the gamut of human emotions. From the cheerful \\"My Lucky Day\\" and \\"Surprise Surprise\\", to the sublime \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" and the sobering \\"The Wrestler\\", the CD delivers the typical emotions of life as seen through Bruce's eyes. The album, while not as strong as \\"Magic\\" is still a winner.
0143038419|5.0|I can only respond to \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" in a personal way, because it touched me to the heart of my being. As a really extraordinary book does, it presented me with a clear and polished mirror in which I could see myself clearly and compassionately. I recognized myself in Gilbert's tale and resonated with her journey of spiritual and romantic healing. It so resembled my own adventure in healing and love.<br /><br />Gilbert weaves the story of her difficult divorce and the personal journey she made abroad in a year of healing. Her intention was to experience pleasure in Italy, spiritual growth in India and the balance of the two in Indonesia. Her memoir reads as a novel; it's that juicy and satisfying...and yet, it is true. This realness amplifies its power to model what is possible for every one of us to create in our own garden. Her struggles break the soil. Her fearless and searching spiritual inventory softens it. And the love she prays for and allows in fertilizes and brings forth such awesome beauty that it raises her upper limits for how much joy she can comfortably live with.<br /><br />The book was originally recommended to me by a woman I met during a time of great loss. I'm glad she planted the seed and though I will probably never see her again, I thank her. Another woman recommended it at the end of the life-saving transformation the loss had propelled me into. It was a wild ride. I had almost finished documenting it in my own book, which I was getting ready to send it to the publisher. This second recommendation got my attention. You know how it is when multiple people in your life mention something? You think, \\"Hmm...well, okay!\\"<br /><br />Usually, I read in my field, spirituality and self-help, grazing three or four books at  time. This juicy tale captured my full attention from beginning to delicious end. I'm hoping that you will give yourself permission to go through Gilbert's beautiful looking-glass and I trust that you will encounter yourself in the magic world of her story.tory.

0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnson presents this text with an academic yet readable approach to the subject matter.  He is truly a scholar and humbly reveals this fact by regurgitating his knowledge to the masses. I highly recommend this book.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and thought the movie was one of the best i've seen in a long while. It was a feast for the eyes on screen and I thought the story was magical.  I'm really surprised it wasn't nominated for a major Oscar category (I think it got a costume nomination)...I look forward to watching it on my new plasma when it comes out on Blu-ray.
0385335482|5.0|The shipper sent it to me very quickly which was a definite plus - once I read the book I cant help but recommend it. Its a fun no-brainer for a lazy night in....<br />Enjoy!
0307346609|5.0|I have read this book before, but lent it to a friend who moved across the country.  This book belongs in every library of Zombie fan.  If you are not a Zombie fan, but like detailed stories then this is the book for you.  It is written in the same format as \\"The Greatest Generation\\"  Where the author travels to different locations interviewing people about their experiances before, durring, and after the Zombie war. A MUST READ!
B00005KB9X|5.0|My husband loves Bob and had this CD when we were teens but it got stolen out of his car, so I replaced it. Its one of our favorites.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Good movie but not great!  I was disappointed that it wasn't like the good westerns back in the day.  I'd rather watch Dances with Wolves, Lonesome Dove... The Missing....
B000093FLA|4.0|This is one of the most interesting films I have watched for several reasons. Its film progression/story line/screen shots could begin a cult following by themselves. It is along the lines of Pulp Fiction in it's unique format. Genuinely unique. However, you have to watch it more than once to really get all the elements hidden through Brad Pitts well done dialect...which makes it all the more humorous! He achieves the effect that his character is truly hard to understand! If you don't like re-watching movies and want to hear everything perfectly the first time, don't bother you will be bored. If you have an eye for the unusual and you like an original story line, watch and re-watch with pleasure!!
B0013FXWU6|4.0|I have been wanting to see this film for quite some time now and for the most part it doesn't disappoint! The story a ruthless, but human oil tycoon is compelling, but the ending left me wanting a bit more. The film is beautifully shot and the acting is wonderful, especially Mr. Lewis's portrayal of the main character. It's a long film, but it never feels that way. This may not be my favorite film of the year, but it's darn good!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Thats Entertainment , original. and Parts 2 and 3 are guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. This collection of clips from MGM musicals reminds you of all those great moments you saw originally and a lot you may have missed. I dont think there is a dud in the lot and you can watch over and over again with enormous pleasure. For sheer energy and joi d vivre, not to mention the brilliant singing dancing and choreography this compilation is unbeatable. Watch Sinatra dance with Kelly and prove that he's as good a dancer as he is a singer. See Cary Grant and Errol Flynn sing and regret that they were'nt allowed to do more of it. Can Clark Gable dance? Well sort of but with him it doesnt matter. Can Joan Crawford? Judge for yourself. There are so many wonderful moments you could go on forever. A buy you'll never regret.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|I've seen the play 6 times between, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento.  While my daughter is in college in NY, I hope to see it there too....but this is the ultimate experience with the story. The up close photography of the characters faces is unbeliveable. All the emotion....made me cry.  This, in all aspects, is the greatest love story EVER.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|If you can take a bit of course language, this is easily the best movie of the year. It takes on racism but so much more than that too. It addresses the fear and cowardice of many people in our society to act when they know something wrong is happening in their neighborhood.    Eastwood is fabulous in this movie. Don't miss this great film.
B000001A3H|4.0|Listen to this album through headphones and see what I mean. It just sounds totally flat with no dynamics whatsoever. Seriously, this album could and should be one the world's greatest instrumental sonic delights/assaults.<br /><br />I've just bought Flower Travellin' Band's amazing album \\"Satori\\", who you could say were a Japanese Black Sabbath. Right after listening to that I put this on and what a difference! I mean that album is over 35 years old and just sounds incredible! \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\" deserves to sound just as good.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is that all the ingredients are in there already, it's just waiting for a remix. Everytime I hear it, especially the song Freedom Run, I can't help but think of the missed potential.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Great Show! I had been wanting to get into this show for a while, and I had head some good reviews from friends, but I was 3 seasons behind, so I got season 1 on dvd.  It gets you hooked quick, and things stay interesting throughout the season.  If you like dark comedy or forensics shows, you will like Dexter.
006135323X|5.0|I studied economics and public policy at an Ivy League university, but I may have learned more useful information from this one book than from all the classes I took.  Read this book and you will learn:    * Why \\"free\\" is so alluring  * Why making the house you're selling the best deal in the neighborhood is the best way to sell it quickly.  (Not always easy in an era of many foreclosures, true...)  * How retailers use games to try to sell you really expensive stuff  * How social interactions and economic interactions differ--and how to make social norms work for you, not against you  * Why the way we think about sexuality and the way we actually behave can diverge so remarkably  * Why the desire to keep options open can harm us.  (And this might be why married couples report much greater happiness and stability than those who cohabitate.)    I could provide more detail, but I've already probably gone far enough.  Ariely is an excellent and entertaining writer, his research is fascinating, and he offers provocative suggestions on how to apply the results of his research in your life.  This is definitely a 5-star work.
1591841992|1.0|This book is hyped a lot, I bought it after I saw the presentation at Mix, the presentation is good and covers everything in the book. The book has too much unnecessary details.
B00006D295|5.0|I must admit that I am from the era when everyone dressed up and acted out all the parts at the movie theatre.  I probably have seen this movie 157 times. To say it is a cult classic is minimizing its impact in some ways.  If you like drag shows or great musicals you will love this movie.  It ain't no \\"High School Musical\\".  Definitely for the kinkier, more adult side of life, yet funny and entertaining and not X rated.  Give this movie a try if you like a walk on the wild side. [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]

B000K7VHJQ|5.0|While this movie was indeed very intense, the message is no doubt the strongest aspect of the film as a whole. It was a great representation of the four gospels, creating a very moving literal interpretation of the famous story.<br /><br />Along with the movie, the second disc contains very imformative mini documentaries on crucifixion, the fate of many of those involved in the story and such.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is grim and life altering.  If you or someone you know thinks they are using drugs casually, they have to see this movie.  Some movies glamorize drug use, but this is definitely not one of them.  This movie is very hard to watch, but it is brilliant.  If you are enabling someone you love to use drugs or minimizing the consequences of using drugs, this movie can definitely open your eyes.  I think it is a must-see for anyone in recovery or who works in that field. [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]
B0014QNGA0|5.0|As much as I enjoyed JDF previous effort, Voce D'Italia - Arias For Rubini, there were times when the voice sounded a bit too pressurized and strained, though his musicality and intelligence were never more present. We have none of the former in this new recording, the aptly titled \\"Bel Canto Spectacular.\\"  This recording is also a bit more varied in the repertoire than its predecessor and that makes for a more stimulating sonic experience; it thankfully avoids being tiresome.  As thrilling as the bravura arias are, high C after high C (and occasional high D) can prove a bit wearing.  There was far too little room left for him to exhibit the seamless legato and the multi-hued qualities of his voice.  Last year, I had the pleasure of hearing JDF live in concert and it proved a magical experience, especially after he delivered what to me was the most moving and eloquent \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\" that I've ever heard, surpassing (sorry folks) Kraus, Gedda, Bjorling and Gigli in terms of phrasing and all around purity of tone and an aching, lyrical quality that nearly brought me to tears.  It was a heartfelt a performance as one could possibly wish for.  In this recording he's managed to recapture the magic of that evening.  What amazes me most about this artist is his ability to make the most difficult musical feats sound positively effortless as if though throwing out 9 high C's were the most routine thing in the world; as natural as yawning.  Though I've enjoyed Ciofi in the past, I must admit that I'm not too thrilled with her in the Linda Di Chamounix duet.  I found the voice a little lacking in heft and color but it blended nicely with Florez's.  Anna Netrebko is in very good voice and her contribution to the Puritani duet wants for nothing.  I'm afraid I could have done without Daniela Barcellona's presence.  Ms. Barcellona's voice sounded labored and is tinged with a Slavic tonal quality that seems to work exclusively in Eastern European repertoire, but certainly isvery much out of place in the frothy world of Rossini's Viaggio A Reims.  The contrast between her voice and that of Florez's is positively jarring.  Domingo's role is a minor one, but as one has come to expect from this legend, is delivered with commitment and panache; quite comfortable (some straining notwithstanding) in the duet from Otello, which serves as the disc's bonus track. The orchestra provides glorious support as does the chorus in its too brief appearances.  Lovers of first rate singing should not pass this up.  Vocal recitals such as this are very rare.
B000002JSH|5.0|Maybe I've always overrated this record a bit; it is not as good overall as the debut, but there are five songs that have given me unlimited joy throughout my life and for that, `Straight Shooter' will always be precious to me. Release in April of 1975 and once again self produced, `Straight Shooter' did keep Bad Company's momentum going, especially in the US. They were seen as a stripped down powerhouse version of their Swan Song patrons Led Zeppelin and while they didn't vary their sound too often (which would lead to a steady decline) , hard rock fans thrilled to the desperado stories and of course the voice of Paul Rodgers. Classic cuts include \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" and \\"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\\" which open the album in powerhouse fashion (in reverse order).  \\"Shooting Star\\" is one of my all-time favorites period and recently was a source of pride for me as I sang this playing the `Rock Band' game!  A triumph and tragedy story like so many in the annals of rock, \\"Star\\" has one of the best fade outs ever! \\"Deal with the Preacher\\" and \\"Wild Fire Woman\\" also deserve mention as great songs and that is really about it as the ballads don't do much for me here.  I don't why critics dump on Bad Company's lyrics; what the hell are they looking for as this music is not meant to be complex, just thrilling and emotional.  As I said previously the law of diminishing returns would begin with the next record although that one was only a slight step down from \\"Shooter\\".   I start to shiver and shake....I just can't wait...

Admittedly I am a senior and many people may not have a problem but be prepared, the print (or type) is uncommonly small.  I would be better off buying a collection in two volumns.  And no, I do not need large-type books.

Hogwash, they didn't read the book, or perhaps were offended by his American patriotism and support of Bush so they made something silly up.    Ignore them.
0312427999|1.0|Naiomi Klein's book is not completely unlike a story a long-winded relative would tell at Thanksgiving. \\"The Shock Docrtine\\" focuses on  on people and institutions Klein despises.  There's the CIA, global capitalism, and the Chicago School, all of which come up time and time again. Although these characters come up repeatedly they do no come up in a logical, linear fashion. Klein will talk about CIA torture in Canada shifting over to Milton Friedman's  involvement with Pinochet and then on to something else. This process continues through something else. I'm really not clear on what the point of this book was other than ad nausem \\"capitalism bad.\\"
B000002VMD|5.0|This is a very good CD and I listen to it many times a week.  One of the best Movie Album releases there is out there.
B000008HPE|5.0|You like Huey Lewis And The News?    Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost.     He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a much more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.    Hey Paul...
B0002234LS|4.0|This may not be an excellent thriller, but it really was entertaining to watch. Writer and Director David Koepp gives Stephen King's novella a very nice flow and atmosphere, but it does tend to slow down in a few parts. The shocks and thrills aren't as strong as, say, the ones found in Asian horror films, but all of the gore effects make it more disturbing than shocking. The very good performances by Depp, Turturro, Bello, Dutton, and Hutton should be worthwhile to those who are about to watch this film. I won't give any details to what happens at the end; you should see for yourself.<br /><br />Grade: B+

B001IHJ97E|4.0|First off is an overview of the cult movie 'Brainstorm'.  It's Natalie Wood's final film, which greatly compromised the original vision of the filmmakers given she still had a number of scenes left unfilmed.  Director Douglas Trumbull, who was the visual effects supervisor for '2001', 'Close Encounters' and 'Blade Runner' aims for Kubrick-like experiential images but the cumulative effect is nowhere near as grandiose or meaningful.  Critics complain the characters are two-dimensional, which they may be, but the actors all around perform well, particularly Louise Fletcher, whose *SPOILER ALERT* death sequence is really powerful and definitely Oscar worthy.  Still, what's there is worthwhile and fun to watch for the most part.<br /><br />Now for the DVD review.  It lacks any extras, which is fine I suppose given there's not a great deal of interest in the title other than a niche.  The feature presentation however on standard DVD is pretty good.  There's color restoration as well as removal of print damage inherent on previous releases, 5.1 surround sound, and it correctly shifts between 1.85:1 pillarboxed and 2.35:1 letterbox.  I guess given the recent success of 'The Dark Knight' on bluray with it's own aspect ratio shifting, showing 'Brainstorm' as it originally appeared theatrically wouldn't be that problematic for home theater philes.<br /><br />In the end, still a cult title that's somewhere between Kubrick and the sentimental humor of Spielberg.  A worthwhile two hours with some really nice visual effects sequences.  I'm glad it's on DVD.
B000LB7G00|4.0|Here's my evaluation of the Space Navigator (used primarily for DAZ Studio).<br /><br />The hardware is first class, solid heavy duty unit sits on the desktop beautifully and is a joy to view and manipulate.<br /><br />The configuration/setup is very poorly done. It is really confusing and does not allow you to actually interact with the controller in order to decide and then immediately set whether you want normal or the inverse directional setting. The number of motions/directions are poorly illustrated and explained. This is not a trivial point, because not having this done right means wasting a lot of time once you understand what you need to do and what works for you.<br /><br />The worst problem is that one of the main control movements is not clearly explained. If you grasp the Space Navigator and anchor your hand on the desktop to provide a firm anchor and simply move it laterally, without tilting or pulling or pushing the center knob (e.g. restrict movement to the lateral plane parallel to desktop) you get a pure motion but this is never properly explained. The other manipulations such as tilting, or pushing or pulling the central knob are fairly reasonably.<br /><br />It is absolutely crucial that you ANCHOR your hand to the surface the Space Navigator rests on, in order to get the purely lateral movement to work properly. If you are not properly anchored and get even miniscule tilt or push pull, you will get unintended \\"confusing\\" movements of your target.<br /><br />The configuration/setup and various guides fail to explain this, or do so very poorly. I figured this out purely by trial and error.<br /><br />A very minor complaint is that a popup comes up everytime you open Photoshop and there is no easy way to tell it not to do that. This is trivial and I mention it simply to show that the software people are not paying attention to users.<br /><br />In summary, this is a Superb 3D Controller, hobbled by an unforgiveably poor SOFTWARE for Configuration/Setup. It's a terrible shame. If you are willing to waste a lot of time figuring it out it is a very useful tool.<br /><br />Like too many computer and computer related devices, this product suffers from software ergonomics problems. The programmers have very poor judgement when it comes to making things easy to learn and use. They need to hire people who understand how to do this and then test and revise software based on improving the areas where people are having difficulty. This needs to be done iteratively until problem areas are gone and novice users learn to configure,setup, and use the product rapidly with little or no complaints. Only then will the ingenuity and creativity of the the hardware designers be fully realized and appreciated.a lot of time figuring it out it is a very useful tool.

0316921173|5.0|(Dictionary and Thesaurus are tools that should stand next to the working writer at all times. They provide him or her with essential service throughout the creative process. One reminds him or her of the precise meaning and application of each word he or she chooses to use, while the other offers a list of alternatives that may better suit the given purpose. In most cases, these tools act as memory refreshers, to help unlock the dusty volumes of words the writer has buried away in his or her brain. In other cases, they offer even the most eloquent and learned writer new information about words, which may better equip him or her to successfully communicate the ideas he or she wishes to share with others. For these reasons and others, it would be foolish to not keep Dictionary and Thesaurus handy when working on a piece of writing.  With that said, I want to inform those who wish to continue reading that I have decided to set aside these tools while writing this review. I've set them aside for a couple reasons. First, I think that part of what causes people to give Infinite Jest a 1 STAR rating is David Foster Wallace's tendency towards clunky terminology. I think they feel it gets in the way, or perhaps deflects the reader from realizing that the book, as a BOOK, maybe isn't as smart as the author would have us believe. And, to be honest, they're right in a way. It's a quick and easy convention of writing, like fireworks, to have readers OOH-ing and AAH-ing over flashy words, and it can swiftly make them forget that the meat and potatoes of the story is the #1 thing you are there to give them as an author. Since this prominent feature of Wallace's writing--the flashy words--is one of the issues that hangs in the balance so often, I want to try and avoid it, because that is not what I am here to talk about.  Another corollary reason that I have set aside Dictionary and Thesaurus is that I don't want to accidentally be guilty of the same convention and thus hang my own review in the balance that way. That is to say, I don't want my words to edge on jargon, or seduce the reader with their literary flashiness. I want them to just be what they are. I think sometimes people do that when they write reviews, seem smart and wax flashy, but it really just cuts them, the reviewer, off at the knees. This is especially the case when we read and write and talk about Wallace. Because it seems like he's always trying to sound smart, so when we do it as reviewers, it almost makes us look stupider. It's hard to dismantle someone's sounding smart and using big words when you yourself are sounding smart and using big words. If that makes sense. Anyways, I don't want this to come off as an effort to hide reality behind a flashy façade, so I am going to leave aside the tools.  Finally, the most important reason I set aside Dictionary and Thesaurus for this is that the only thing I want to stand next to me while I write my review for Infinite Jest is Infinite Jest. The text, the whole text and nothing but the text. I think it's important for you to know this, and if you've made it this far without losing interest, read on. (I promise it won't be that long).)    When I was younger I used to read a lot, and part of the thing about being young and reading a lot is that somewhere in the back of your head you do it to be cool. Sure, you read to enliven your life with the spirit of a fun story, to escape to imagined realities etc. But you know that when you take on something BIG, the major part of taking it on and finishing it is to be able to say that you did. Most times, you don't remember (unless you're really smart and attentive) what made the BIG thing actually good, if it was even good at all, but you say that you liked it because you feel proud for having completed it. And also because people who you think are smart say they liked it too. For BIG things like Infinite Jest, this is often the case. Other people though, who are really smart in certain ways, will throw light on the fact that just because something is BIG doesn't mean it's good, and just because you made it through it, doesn't mean you're smart. Readers of Infinite Jest get this all the time. In fact, a real lot of these really smart people will sometimes pimp-slap young Infinite Jest readers by giving the book a 1 STAR rating.  And you know what, many of them are right. There's all this critical hullabaloo that shrouds the book--especially since Wallace offed himself last year--and it is really easy to engage a debate between the people who loved it as young, excited readers and the people who were upset that the plot fell off a cliff. You could sling mud from either side, and you'd have a whole crew of people at your back with any position you took. You could say it's the opus of the headmaster of a generation. You could say it's self indulgent and uber-hip in a self-destructive way.  You could even call it Science Fiction and you wouldn't quite be wrong for shaking the dice that way. The one thing I think it's hard to do though, is say that it's only worth 1 STAR. I give it 5, and here is why:  The people among us who were once young readers will agree that, as a young reader, you are often wont to make annotations in books. You highlight and underline things, put stars and asterisks along side paragraphs, and in the backs of books you jot down what parts you think were sweet. It's a terribly academic thing to do, and the major merit it offers is evidence for your English teacher that you did some work on the at-home reading.   For me though, these \\"young reader\\" annotations I made are an immaturity that I'm incredibly thankful for. Because now I find myself, years later, sitting at bars getting drunk, or having parties at my house, or out on the golf course or something, where I inevitably stumble on some idea that can best--if not only--be truly described by some passage of a book that I read once when I was younger. And I find myself in these darker, yet passion filled moments calling most frequently on passages from the book Infinite Jest. Thankfully, I have underlined them to make them easy to find.  Maybe it's a generational thing, maybe it's just what spoke to me. But I feel in the book some truths that have never been better demonstrated than by the simple stories of folks like Don Gately or Hal or Pemulis; Orin, Lyle the sweat guru and the PGOAT. The simple existence of folks like Lyle and the PGOAT. The actual subject of J.O.I's lethally entertaining movie Infinite Jest IV. In them are truth. These are slices of life. Forget all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the flashy terminology, what happens to these people is slices of life. And few short of Dostoevsky and Salinger are capable of providing these sorts of slices with such plainness and truth.  At the end of the day, I guess it's just that I keep going back to it. I mean, I've studied other great works, the usual suspects in the list of important books. I know some of them inside and out. But with this book I find myself continuously cropping it back up. I keep finding things in my life, when I'm out doing my thing with friends, that hearken some of the finer, more poignant parts of stories from it. (Quickly, I'll note that I don't do drugs or play tennis. I'm thinking more about how \\"The Darkness\\" keeps waking up to find his bed on the ceiling, and later can't get his face off the window.) And even though it is a bear, though it took me three stupid years to read, when I flip back through and look at things I underlined, I can't help but melt from the truth that some of them tell.  So because of this, I think it's hard to say it's 1STAR. 1 STAR books are like novel versions of Legally Blonde II, and the works of James McCain. This is something that has in it real truth in places at least. And some of the lines in there can have you going back again and again. If you gave it 1 STAR, I beg you to go back, flip to a line, and reconsider. If you were good about underlining, you may find things that make sense. And if you do, at least give it 2.
0316067601|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, even knowing the outcome. Fantastic story telling made me shiver, and I won't lie,I had a few tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. Thank you doesn't cut it for all the men and women fighting for us but thats all I have. THANKS ARMED FORCES MEMBERS AND FAMILIES!!
B001F7MSFM|2.0|I wanted to like it, but the disappointing storyline was too big an obstacle. Perlman's wisecracks and gritty attitude were funny, but Del Toro's normally inspired storytelling couldn't carry this comic book sequel. Hard to follow the plot, with the thousands of bizarre Star Wars creatures. I'd recommend the first one instead.  http://www.amazon.com/Hellboy-William-Hoyland/dp/B001AK3S4Y/
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is a rare find.  It is the kind of book you are always searching for and almost never find.  A friend gave me this book and I tell everyone I know to read it.  It is captivating, beautifully descriptive, moving.....I could go on and on.  The author speaks to the heart of the human condition.  I could not put this book down but I was sad when I finished it, I missed the world he had lived and re-lived on paper.  I probably will not find another book of this caliber for a long time
B00009MGGI|5.0|BBC's HOUSE OF CARDS trilogy is one of the finest min-series ever produced for television. From the engaging story to the truly memorable acting of Ian Richardson and a superb cast of supporting actors, everything is first rate.The evil, Machiavellian British Prime Minister at the heart of the story is no different than the dastardly characters in Shakespeare as well as some of the most insidious politicos around today in any country. One of the chapters is called TO PLAY THE KING.  Indeed, how many of us have been played by Francis Urquharts all around the world. A brilliant, engrossing tale and a cautionary one as well. Brilliant.
B00164IV9G|3.0|Gigi (Goodwin) is getting dating advice from Alex (Long).  Beth (Aniston) has been living with her boyfriend Neil (Affleck) for years, but he shows no signs of proposing marriage.  Janine (Connelly) and Ben (Cooper) are married and have just bought a new house; but Ben is cheating on her with Anna (Johansson).  Anna is currently seeing Connor (Connolly), but it isn't that serious.      Like \\"Love, Actually\\" before it, \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" weaves multiple, related storylines together dealing with love and relationships.  Unfortunately, it does not do so as well, and runs about fifteen minutes too long.  There is a lot of star power here, and they do the best they can with what they are given, but only about half of the story lines work in any real way.  Still, there is enough here to entertain many.  This is best left for DVD if it must be seen.
0312427999|5.0|An exceptional book. Naomi Klein brilliantly exposes the capitalist nightmares that have plagued humanity since the last century.She does so clearly and unambiguously so that there is no doubt left as to who the real culprits are. A very brave book and one that all human beings should read.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|Despite the fact that their prior ouevre has aged majestically over time, I approached this third effort with trepidation.  Why?  Because, to be blunt, their second album was a failure and very nearly marked the extinction of the group.    Not because it was bad--far from it.  But rather, in my opinion, because Dummy met with accidental worldwide acclaim and they didn't know how to top themselves while maintaining their own interest and integrity.    With that years-old benchmark on the doorstep, Third was bound to be an exercise of living in interesting times.  The only question in my mind was if they would retread Dummy, or if they would make an artists' declaration of creativity and focus specifically on making something as different as possible.    They chose the latter.    Sadly, when you choose the opposite of every choice that is good, you don't necessarily end up with a different flavor of good.  You usually end up with something really, really bad.  And sadly, that's what this is.    I can hear the fanboi clickage sweeping on down to give me a \\"not helpful\\" for speaking my mind, but for those of you who are open-minded enough to hear me out:  This album is bad for a reason.  It's dissonant, distant, meandering, minimalist and absurdist all at once.  It's as if they knew that people wanted a trip hop beat (Portishead the product, vs. Portishead the artist consortium), and so they provided an anti-beat instead.  They knew people wanted confessional lyrics delivered in an empathic manner, so they kept the content and made the delivery as confrontationally unappealing as possible.  In short, this album is bad not because of a lack of talent, but rather because of the unwillingness of the artists to be pigeonholed.    For me, that is a noble, self-indulgent \\"statement as failure,\\" and saves this from being a 1-star effort.  But with one, possibly two exceptions, I can safely say that these songs will not be entering my collection.  Let's say you like Impressionism.  You go to the museum expecting to see the Monets and Renoirs you saw last time, but instead you find a series of postmodernist abstracts featuring red triangles superimposed on trash cans.    What is your response?  Do you applaud the museum's audacity in challenging the preconceptions of the audience?  If so, buy this album.  But if you were expecting Portishead--and it pains me to say this--you would be better off buying a CD of their imitators, or just staying away entirely.    Sometimes, you just can't go back home.  Why?  Because while you were gone, your family moved away and installed a pack of wild dogs wearing tuxedos in your house, and now they're hiding in the bushes watching your reaction.    My own reaction is to sell the house and move.  But hey, sorry for the meandering abstract.  This album had a negative pervasive effect on me that is still lingering in the mind.

0375826726|2.0|After hating this trilogy with vehement passion for the past few years, I've come to concede that OK, it is kind of fun, even if every sentence sort of insults your brain. At best I'd put it in the same category as Twilight, new Britney Spears songs, and porn. After a period of reflection you want to close it and then smack yourself, but can't help but wallow in its guilty pleasures.     His writing has improved (after the first two, I suppose it had nowhere else to go but up), though his misunderstanding of the purpose and methods of writing are still frustrating. He needs to stop engaging in    1. Obnoxious, narcissistic protagonists. It'd be different if Eragon was more like a Byronic hero, but as it is, sometimes I like to visualize a crossover universe where I get to meet Eragon and then soundly punch him in the face.     3. Lame plots in general    4. Lame romantic plots, specifically. The best you can do is at least make Arya's attraction to Eragon plausible. But it's even less convincing than Katherine Heigl-Seth Rogen in Knocked Up.    5. Characters with nonexistent personalities, only except to argue with (and ultimately grovel to) Eragon    6. No character development.    7. Thesaurus Rape (its a little better this time, though I will never forgive Paolini for \\"I'm Sorry,\\" apologized Brom\\")    8. Torture porn (though I suppose with the endless melanges of head-cutting and limb-slashing, it wouldn't attract half the readers.     My take: Keep writing. Stop publishing. Take your head out of your rear (you can't just ignore reviews forever, Paolini. A little humility is important for all writers, even ones with publishers for parents. The time will come when you no longer have youth as an excuse. But then again, this kind of writing isn't usually tolerated in my high school English class, so I'm not sure where these standards are coming from.)
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I think I'll make my first observation:  This is a \\"win some and lose some\\" album.  That means that it will both attract fans and repel them.  Springsteen fans tend to be very territorial over the style of music Bruce records.  Some like the Asbury Park period, some like the Born in the USA period, others like the in between period (1986-1998), others like the Rising period, etc.  Any deviation from their particular favorite period brings a backlash of criticism.      Now as for myself, I actually enjoy it all.  I enjoy listening to a bunch of random Springsteen songs in chronological order just to hear the changes in songwriting and arranging.  That is why I enjoy this album so much.  If I want to listen to back catalogue, I can go to the back albums themselves.  If an artist comes out with a new album, I want to see how they've grown.      This album is a very fun but thought provoking exercise in hearing the whole group of musicians have fun doing what they do.  A polar opposite of 2007's \\"Magic\\", this album has a much more upbeat and  positive collection of songs.  Even in the positive atmosphere, there is a marked sadness in \\"The Last Carnival\\", a song remembering recently deceased organist Danny Federici.  All in all, the album shows great creativity in exploring new sounds and seeing what this group of musicians can accomplish.    Some fans may not like this approach, and to them I off the advice spoken by guitarist/vocalist Little Steven Van Zandt:  \\"Just listen to the album and have fun!\\"    On to the DVD.  The DVD offers a great video of \\"Night with the Jersey Devil\\", as well as a very intimate taping of the recording sessions.  What I love about this DVD is that it can make you appreciate the music even more because you can see the songs being developed.  It shows the raw reaction to the news of Danny Federici's death, shows the gang laughing it up, and even shows them making mistakes.  After all, they are human beings, too!
B001CZVVVO|5.0|Even if you're not a big fan of classical music or opera, you'll like this tour-de-force of vocal artistry.  The setting is gorgeous:  a hillside amphitheatre on a summer's eve before sunset, ending with then possibilty of a summer night's storm inundating the scene (but that didn't happen).    We all knoow about Placido, after all he's one of the two surviving \\"Three Tenors,\\" and he's been on Letterman!  (Just like Madonna!)  But you'll be pleased by the performance of the up-and-comers Rolando Villazon and Anna Netrebko (by the way, gorgeous eye-candy in Blu-ray).    There's a healthy selection of French and Italian composers, but the only German selection (without double-checking the liner notes) was a rousing and boisterous drinking song that was a fitting prelude to the tri-partite finale selctions.    If you have any affection for Placido, you won't be disappointed by this concert disc and the happy selection of his musical companions.
006056251X|5.0|I loved this book, as I have loved all Lisa Klepas' books so far.  Her characters are so loving and warm and fascinating, although they  don't start out that way.  That's the fun of seeing them emerge into  wonderful people. One would never think that Sebastian would turn out  so different by the end of the book.  Evie also emerged into a lovely  and interesting woman.  I love the way Ms. Klepas includes the previous  book characters, Evie's friends, Lillian, Annabelle and Daisy.  I can't  wait to read Daisy's story next.  I have read these books backwards,  as I started with the Hathaways and got so interested I had to read  the previous series that led to that series.
B0012GMW34|4.0|I received my cd quickly and in good condition although the case was really broken.  It was easy to replace and I have enjoyed having this album again.  I remembered it from a long time ago and wanted to get it again and it has been worth it.  I really enjoy the long tracks, especially A love Supreme.
B000803PKY|5.0|The recording industry should be be producing more fine works like this on DVD-Audio. Buy a copy, before it's too late. Listening to this great live album in 5.1 DVD-Audio is like going back in time.
B000JVT1U0|2.0|I had read great reviews of this film so my wife and I both just watched it and were extremely dissapointed. The film is extremely slow, which sometimes can be great if it builds tension, however in this case it was just boring. Snail pace to a very predictable ending. This is not a horror film at all, so if you want to be scared go elsewhere.
0385340990|1.0|I purchased this book because of the clever title and good reviews.<br />I just could never get into it. Weak and wooly. I MAY have enjoyed it if I was 13 years old. Some of the writings helped me to appreciate the story settings, but overall, I found it watery and unfocused. I kept reading hoping it would get better...
B001ER4CSO|5.0|If you enjoy sci-fi and comic book hero movies you'll love Hellboy and Hellboy 2. There is a lot of excitement and Hollywood magic. They're so tongue in cheek funny I can't help laugh most of the way through them. They are just good old fashion fun movies. Buy and enjoy!
B0001I561E|1.0|What an awful experience.  These people charged me but never sent me the product, never called or sent me any kind of notice.  I had to contact them and inquire where it was to wit I was told it was \\"on its way\\".  4 WEEKS LATER - No product, no refund, just an email (responding to mine) telling me I should \\"probably request a refund\\"!!!  Not even \\"we've refunded your money\\".  I am still waiting for them to refund my card (as of yet they have NOT)  BUYER BEWARE!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a great controller, sturdy, fits well in your hands. My only complaint would be the lack of vibration at times, not as intense as it should be but it really depends on what game you're playing. All in all the best controller available. Holds a long charge too! 5/5

B000OVLBF8|5.0|Nicolas Cage is not my favorite movie star. I usually find him boring and jejune. But, for some reason, I enjoy his performance very much in this obviously science fiction movie. The other movie he is a leading actor which I enjoy is \\"Next\\". Back to \\"Ghost Rider\\", as a motor cycle stunt rider, Johnny Blaze long ago made a pact with the devil to cure his father's cancer. The cancer was gone but the father died anyway for other reason, and Johnny resents this very much. Now years later the devil has come to collect. By day Johnny remains a die-hard stunt rider but, at night, in the presence of evil, he becomes the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter charged with collecting rogue souls and demons and bringing them back to hell. Forced to do the devil's bidding, Johnny is determined to confront his fate and use his new curse and power to defend the innocent and protect the weak. Watch this movie and you will experience a high-energy thrill ride.
0765309408|5.0|Mankind has started to spread out in the galaxy, and so have a lot of other races. The available real estate is scarce, which leads to near-constant war for land.    The only way for Americans to get into space is to join the Colonial Defense Force (CDF). They guard human colonies, and go to war over disputed planets. The CDF only takes people who have reached their 75th birthday. A vague promise of being made young again is a pretty strong incentive to sign up. The catch is that joining the CDF is a one-way trip. If you survive your tour of duty, hardly a sure thing, you will spend the rest of your life on some colony planet; returning to Earth is not an option.    John Perry signs up. He just turned 75, his wife, Kathy, died several years previously, and his one adult son lives on his own. On the spaceship taking him, and several hundred others, to basic training on another planet, he learns just what the becoming young part is all about. His consciousness is transferred into a cloned body, in its mid-twenties, made from his own DNA, which was extracted from him several years previously. It's very much of a new and improved body with a green skin color. He also has a computer implanted in his brain, which can talk to him and communicate with anyone else.    After basic training, Perry and his squad travel from planet to planet. Friends die, and new friends are made. During one disastrous operation, Perry crash lands on a planet, and is rescued by. . . his wife. She too is green, but the resemblance is way too close to be a coincidence. She (her name is Jane) is part of the Ghost Brigades, actually clones of dead people. Having no conception of what life is like as a realborn, they are kept far away from the rest of the CDF. Perry is made part of a Ghost Brigades squad, and begins to tell his squadmates what it's like to be married, and to love another person.    Here is an excellent novel. It has space travel, it has weirdness, it has heart and it has a lot of great writing. This is highly recommended.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|After months of anticipation and watching every preview - I believed the self important reviewers and skipped Speed Racer when it was released in the theaters.  This means I hadn't seen it yet when we were deciding which of our x-mas movies to use to break in our new Onkyo amp (also purchased through amazon - point,click,ship.)  I overrode all debate (my ballerina wife, American Girl fanatic daughters, speed crazed toddler son and I can never agree) and chose Speed Racer.  Boy were we all surprised.  I cannot remember the entire family enjoying a movie that much - ever.  Almost from the word go the usual complaints of \\"It's too loud\\" or \\"I wanted to watch ----\\" were silenced as everyone was on the edge of their seats or jumping out of them while this movie placed itself directly into the list of family favorites.  For my wife and I it was such an artful interpretation of the classic anime series we were both taken straight back to our childhoods.  I didn't even know she watched it.  The film reached out and grabbed the whole family so completely that we each felt that we to had won against all odds when Speed crossed the finish line in the final race.  I was amazed both at how it completely exceeded my own expectations - but also completely satisfied the entertainment appetites of my 15 year old daughter, my 3 year old son and everyone in between.  Definitely a must have film even if you are not hopelessly addicted to racing.
B000002BE9|5.0|Absolutely worth any amount of money. Read the lyrics, listen to her beautiful voice and the emotions that flows from it. AMAZING! Love her.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog amazed me when it came out via the internet this past summer. Neil Patrick Harris is brilliant, and the rest of the cast is impeccable. Joss Whedon and the rest of the directors/writers really put a lot into this, and it shows that they enjoyed what they were doing.<br />Sure, this is available to watch for free on the internet, but I felt it was important to support this effort financially. I would like to see more films of this sort be produced, and the best way to \\"vote\\" for that is to purchase this DVD. And the special features alone are worth the purchase price!
0307269752|5.0|I can't say when I last enjoyed a book as much as I enjoyed, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It was a excellent crime novel! Don't get discouraged if the first chapter is slow, it picks up very quickly and you really won't be able to put it down. How sad that this incredable writer is no longer with us. I'm sooooo excited for the next book to be released. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful mystery!
1423101464|5.0|All the books so far have been fantastic, and I can't wait for the fifth to come out. I don't want to spoil the book like other amazon reviewers but I will say that the book is like the previous books, fun, full of adventure, and over way too soon. Although the book is over 300 pages you'll find yourself finished with the book is a mere 3-4 hours. Despite that the book is definately worth reading.       I was a little disappointed in the romance department. I know that the book is intended for younger readers (myself a teenager) but I wish that Rick Riordan had put a little more romance between Annabeth and Percy in the fourth book. I mean they're fourteen and Annabeth gave Percy a kiss just like that. I wasn't even expecting that to happen until it did. Rick Riordan gave Percy and Calypso better romantic scenes.       I can't ramble on and on about this, overall it's a great book and definately worth reading. Can't wait for the fifth to come out. (Romance scenes please)!
0671646788|5.0|I purchased a book called \\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\".  I am happy to say that the book is not just a collection of fluff like so many books, but rather a pratical guide to focus your efforts towards your goals.  I would recommend this book to anyone.

0380977788|5.0|As Diana Wynne Jones noted, \\" ... this book will nudge Alice in Wonderland out of its niche ...\\"  With parallels in setting and plot, few books in fantasy are comparable.    The Fourteenth door in Coraline's flat does not open, but leads to a brick wall.  One day when Coraline opened the door to find a flat that is a mirror image of hers.  Also on the other side is another mother and another father, who want Coraline to stay with them.  And to have this happen, her other mother pulls out an array of tricks designed to force her to stay.  But in order to win at a game, one must have their own set of tricks as a means to the goal.  Coraline is a worthy opponent.  Along the way Coraline encounters bizarre creatures and other lost souls which she must save.  With unexpected twists, Coraline faces few dull moments.    Though I was never overly impressed with Neil Gaiman's other works, I truly enjoyed this particular one.  In writing a children's book, he created a connection I never saw in his other work.
B000000OAL|4.0|This disk was a showcase of the magnificance of future Queen productions.  Each member contributes lyrically and musically to the selection, and the vocals are perfect harmonies.  Brian May's guitar layers sound almost like syntesizers, prompting the liner notes (and on subsequent releases)\\"No Syths\\".  The songwriting moods change throughout, including the May penned hit \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and the dramatic moods of Mercury's \\"Liar\\", which begins to showcase his ability to draw from diverse sections and construct a song that works.  I particularly like \\"The Night Comes Down\\", appreciating the mood changes, the flaminco guitar influenced part that starts the song, and the actual chord structure that plays upon a D variation.  Great stuff, but not necessarily their best work.
B000CCIVDO|3.0|Well where do i start. lets start with the design. its not so bad but when you try to put them on to get that closed ear kinda thing going, you start to realize that they must have made these things for lil kids or something. MAN THIS THING IS LITTLE. it feels like a very cheap headphone that you would find in walmart or taget or something of that nature. as far as the sound goes, that is where these headphone shine. the sound is great. i've been creating music for a while now and these are some great sounding headphones. and the price that comes with this is pretty good as well. if you're looking for some great studio headphones and you dont wanna break out the big bucks for them. this is a pretty good deal but i heard that the HPS3000 is better and they fit better as well. i havent tried them yet but as far as the HPS5000. they are a lot smaller than they look on the pics that you see online. do your research first before purchasing these. trust me. im not mad at this purchase because of the sound but i definately dont like the feel and comfort of these headphones. they're good but not good enough. definatelly not what they appear to be.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This is a great item, but the only real problem is that it will not charge unless the USB hub is actually connected to a PS3 that is TURNED ON or a computer that is TURNED ON.<br />I'm not sure why Sony did this but when your PS3 is powered off it does not charge whatever is connected to its USB ports.  Furthermore, the controller will not activate its charging circuit unless the host USB device is either an active computer or a PS3.  The irony here is that you can connect this controller to your Nintento Wii to charge it since the Nintendo Wii, as far as this controller knows, is a PC that is always on in low-power sleep mode and will charge this controller, while the much-vaunted PS3 is NOT which is a typical Sony oversight.<br /><br />If you can disregard the appalling charging problem the controller performs as expected.  The fact that you cannot charge it easily is a major disadvantage.  I don't know what Sony was thinking but they weren't thinking about how people actually use this device in the real world.  Nevertheless it returns force-feedback (vibration) to the PS3 console.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Having been cheated on, this movie disturbed me...but hey, that's my problem.  Otherwise, it's a good film.  All actors do a fine job.
B00005JPTK|3.0|There's a lot to like in this film. Will Smith is excellent, the direction is sharp, the first half of the film handles the problem of one actor alone with no one else to interact with marvelously, and even the special effects manage not to go too overboard.    It all falls apart in the last half hour. The ending of the film (either ending, theatrical or alternate) totally destroys what the real meaning of the title was in the original novel. In the interest of appealing to a mass audience, the writer's completely abandoned the heart and soul of the story and replaced with a paper-thin pseudo-religious feel-good miracle plot device that you would expect from a made-for-TV movie.    It's worth seeing, especially for Will Smith, but the ending will leave you disappointed.

B00164IV9G|5.0|I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan. I also love Jennifer Connelly and who doesnt love cute as a button Drew Barrymore? Here we find these lovely ladies all in different stages of love. Drew Barrymore works at a magazine with a bunch of homosexual guys who try to give her advice because she cant seem to get it right. Scarlett Johannson has a guy in love with her, but she has no interest as she likes a married man more. Jennifer Connolly seems satisfied in her married life until she finds it all to be a sham. Jennifer Aniston finds that she isnt really satisfied just living with a man for seven years and not being married. Then we have Gigi, she is the one actively looking for a man but being extremely clingy in the process. She finally gets some hints from Justin Long that she isnt what men are looking for, and she needs to change her plan of attack drastically.     Its a great movie. Its a coming of age romantic comedy set to the digital age that reminds us that love can be found when we least expect it. We do not have to change for a man. We also dont have to wait around for his call. Women can pick up the phone the same way. Excellent movie with an all star cast definitely worth seeing and worth owning.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Here we have Liam Neeson's character trying to make up for lost time with his daughter as he has not been present for most of her life. So he leaves the life he loves to be home and be closer to her. His wife has remarried a wealthy individual and hates him with a passion. When his daughter asks to go to Paris with a friend for the summer, he begrudgingly agrees as he assesses the risks associated with her being alone. When she gets to Paris she of course meets a kind gentleman and ends up in the tragic world of human trafficking. The 96 hour window our hero is given spreads thin as he uses his extensive training to find everyone responsible for her disappearance. Great movie, great effects. One of the first in awhile where I didnt find too many flaws, everything came together. It made sense and it wasnt just someone running around killing everyone, there was intelligence behind it.
B00004VVNB|4.0|I've been a lifelong fan of Sci-Fi films of all types and varieties. I first watched \\"Logan's Run\\" around the age of 7 (circa 1979) on TV and have loved the movie ever since. Between the interesting plot, highly stylized set pieces, intricate minatures work, expansive and beautiful matte paintings, and of course, Jenny Agutter, what's not to like here?<br /><br />The movie's setting is the year 2274 and it is clear from the beginning that some great catastrophe has occured which has forced the remnants of humanity into giant domed cities. Within lies a sprawling futuristic metropolis peopled by individuals all under the age of 30 and dressed in color coordinated clothing (Yellow for pre-teens, Greens for late teens and early 20's, and Red for mid 20's to 30). Each citizen has implanted in their left palm a \\"lifeclock\\", a small crystal which changes color when certain stages of age are reached. It begins to flash once it's owner has offically reached age 30, marking a very significant stage. When one hits the age of 30 they join in an activity called \\"Carousel\\". There these 30 year olds go through a rather mystical ceremony in which they are systematically (and willingly) obliterated by the city's central computer in a high-flying way. In this fashion the inhabitants are \\"Renewed\\", that is processed by the computer to begin life again in the body of a newborn infant. Anyone who wants to keep on living and doesn't want to join in Carousel, for whatever reason/s, is called a \\"Runner\\". A group of pseudo-police called \\"Sandmen\\" are responsible for chasing down Runners and terminating them.<br /><br />To the viewer there is something way out of whack with this system and it's clear that the populace is not being given the full story and seem to live life for sex, drugs, and rock n' roll (or disco in this case). Logan 5 (Michael York) is a Sandman alongside his best friend Francis 7 (Richard Jordan), also a Sandman, and go through the daily activities of looking for Runners and living a stress-free life filled with all things carnal. After dispatching a Runner and looting his belongings, Logan takes into possession a small metallic Ankh. The city's Central Computer, recognizing the symbol, assigns Logan with the task of finding \\"Sanctuary\\", a mythical safe haven for Runners who flee the city, and destroying it. To help Logan infiltrate the underground society which enables Runners to get to Sanctuary, the computer advances Logan's lifeclock from age 26 to age 30, forcing him to become a Runner himself.<br /><br />The movie gets a lot of criticism for being heavily laden with the styles and mannerisms of the 70's, and the inclusion of Farrah Fawcett-Majors did not help as she was as symbolic of the decade as anyone else. The model work, pretty cool stuff at the time, is *clearly* model work now. But one must remember that this movie was made in an era when things such as CGI and advanced special effects did not exist (Star Wars opened that door a year later in 1977) and so the modern viewer is forced to suspend disbelief to a degree in order to enjoy the movie more fully.<br /><br />And when one successfully does suspend that disbelief there is a jewel of a movie to be found here. The sets are nicely put together and the situations that Logan and Jessica (played by Jenny Agutter) find themselves in on their trek to Sanctuary are mind blowing stuff. It is interesting watching these two transform from members of a lascivious and hedonistic society to a pair of innocent and almost naive people as they first discover the world outside the dome. The film really reaches it's emotional climax when Logan and Jessica find and explore the ruins of the familiar (and yet alien) Washington DC.<br /><br />I've not read the book upon which the movie was based, however I plan on doing so in the near future. The plot and setting leave many questions regarding the world in which Logan and Jessica live (not the least of which is \\"How did this whole thing come about?\\") and speculating on those answers is a fun mental exercise while watching Logan and Jessica as they explore long-forgotten fisheries underneath the city, a frozen seafood storage facility run by a robot gone haywire (Roscoe Lee Browne), and a long lost civilization abandoned and grown over with weeds. The movie also raises more serious societal questions and concerns, mostly with regards to age, vanity, and sex. At what point will dying be a question which is decided by the State (or the Computer, in this case) rather than by Nature? I've heard of some place in Europe where this is already playing out, with elderly people being euthanized on the decision of their children, thus saving the State extra expenses. Serious stuff indeed.<br /><br />If one can get past the clearly 70's influenced styles and some rather out of date special effects, they will likely enjoy this wonderful film on its own merits. I'm not sure that I like the idea of a remake as modern remakes tend to overdo it and completely bury the intent and enjoyability of the movie being remade (see The Poseidon Adventure as proof of this, among many others). This is a great movie that I never tire of watching!those answers is a fun mental exercise while watching Logan and Jessica as they explore long-forgotten fisheries underneath the city, a frozen seafood storage facility run by a robot gone haywire (Roscoe Lee Browne), and a long lost civilization abandoned and grown over with weeds.

B0000024K1|5.0|I figured what the heck, I'm going to finally write a review for my favorite hip-hop album of all-time today...released in 1988 during the height of extremely creative and great hip-hop music, in my opinion this album stood above them all, even now 22 years after it's release it still stands above them all, WHY?? Chuck D's voice and messages are just powerful, Da Bomb Squad's production with it's multi-layered samples is just revolutionary and timeless, Flavor Flav's outbursts are just right on point and in sync with Chuck, I mean this album represents PERFECTION...in life there supposedly is no such thing as perfection, but this album achieved that and much more...this album is like a beautiful painting, or an incredible vacation, just something that you will never forget, it's completely TIMELESS...22 years from now these topics will still need to be covered and the production will still be revolutionary and different...I'm not sure what Chuck and Da Bomb Squad were thinking about when they went into the studio to create this masterpiece but we're all better for what they gave us, I want to personally thank them for this gift that keeps on giving even 22 years after they originally gave it to me..If your a young hip-hop fan looking for some VINTAGE hip-hop or an older hip-hop head who may have been among the few that actually missed this over the past 22 years then add this one to your collection ASAP...you'll find bliss in every track and lyric...my top five songs-(if that is possible here) are:<br /><br />Bring The Noise<br />Rebel Without A Pause<br />Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos<br />Prophets Of Rage<br />Don't Believe The Hype<br /><br />but basically the WHOLE project is just memorable and the greatest artistic effort released in hip-hop history, this MUST be in your collection!
0452289963|5.0|In &#34;A New Earth&#34; Eckhart Tolle encourages us to transcend our ego-based state of consciousness, i.e., our attachment to our conditioned mental patterns. According to Tolle we can be happy and end the suffering and conflict in the world by experiencing our essential self, which is prior to thought and the inner body is the bridge between form (our mental conditioning) and the formless (our essential self). Inner body awareness is the doorway out of our mental conditioning.<br /><br />According to Tolle our body has its own intelligence and this intelligence reacts to our thoughts. In other words our mind and body &#34;talk&#34; to each other. So our &#34;story&#34; consists not only of mental but also physical recordings. In fact, the voice in our head is continually disrupting our body's natural state of wellbeing.<br /><br />Every negative thought we have leaves behind a remnant of physical pain in our body. Tolle calls it the &#34;pain body.&#34; Our negative thoughts live on in our body. The good news is that we can dissolve the pain body by bringing the light of presence to it. Only PRESENCE can dissolve the unconscious past stored in us. Through observation of physical sensation, spirit is freed from its imprisonment in form. This is spot-on useful information. I love all of Tolle's books but words re just words -- painted cakes do not satisfy hunger.<br /><br />Fortunately there is a meditation course available where you can put the material in &#34;A New Earth&#34; to the test experientially. Information on this course can be found in [[ASIN:0060637242 The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation]] by William Hart.

1577314808|5.0|\\"The Power of Now\\" is an excellent book! Mr. Tolle claims that we can \\"break out of the inherited collective mind patterns that have kept humans in bondage to suffering for eons\\" by finding our true nature beyond name and form. Well that's a pretty tall order for a book.  How do we find our true nature?<br /><br />Well, according to Tolle, our thinking and emotions are reflected in the body and shows up there as pain/sensation. Every painful thought and emotion that we have ever had leaves behind a residue of pain in the body. This pain merges with pain from the past and accumulates in what he calls the \\"pain body.\\"<br /><br />Our emotions are stored in the pain body and if we don't bring the light of consciousness into the pain we will be forced to re-live these emotions again and again. But when we bring the light of consciousness into the pain body and directly feel its energy it can no longer control our thinking. Our mind then becomes a wonderful tool because we are now no longer trapped in it.<br /><br />So we can reclaim consciousness from the mind by taking the focus away from our thinking and directing it toward our body. Awareness of our body keeps us present and anchors us in the now. The way to our true nature is through the body, not away from it. Unless we stay present in our body we will continue to be mechanically run by our menatl conditioning -- does the name Pavlov ring a bell?<br /><br />I have discovered a way to put this material in \\"The Power of Now\\" to the test--experientially. There is a course where we can bring the light of consciousness into the pain body and systematically reduce our mental conditioning and we can do this in a controlled environment for 10 days?<br /><br />You can discover your true nature, your deeper Self rooted in Being and IMO you can find out how in [[ASIN:0060637242 The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation]] by William Hart.

B001FOPODS|5.0|This DVD features the 2007 Academy Award Winner for Best Short (Animated).  It was featured on PBS last year, but even if you recorded that presentation, there is much that this DVD has to offer.    First, the main feature is presented with an option to begin with the introduction that shows what instrument and theme are assigned to each character.  The feature itself is an extraordinary accomplishment, presenting a darker view of the tale than we are used to.  No Disney clownishness here.  Instead we have a gaunt, forlorn Peter, up against a pretty frightening wolf.    The extras include not only the making of documentary that was included with the PBS special, but also another subtitled Polish documentary.  Most fascinating is a rough print version, with some scenes fully completed, and others in various stages of completion.  This version shows a lot of the work that went into this labor-intensive project.    As for the reviewer who objected to the story variances, may I suggest that in future you headline such reviews with a \\"spoiler alert.\\"  In any event, I do not find these changes to the classic tale objectionable, and they are certainly not contradicted by the music.    For the reviewer who was hoping for a music lesson, what can I say?  This film is so much more.    If you dislike stop animation projects, or have problems with Prokofiev's simple musical sketch, then move on.  Otherwise, this ia a fantastic buy.
0385338732|5.0|Any chick lit book requires some sort fo suspension of disbelief. Once you're able to do that - Sophie Kinsella's books are some of the best out there, and she's my personal favorite.<br /><br />The first chapter describes the miserable life of 25 years old Lexi Smart, who has a lousy job, a boyfriend who stood her up once again, and her dad just died. On her way home from a night out with the girls, she gets hit with a car - and wakes up in the hospital as a 28 year old.<br /><br />To her surprise - her 28 years old self has everything she had ever wished to have: lots of money, a great job, a handsome & caring husband (with loser Dave out of sight), the perfect home, and she somehow has a perfect figure, a perfect smile and designer clothes and bag.<br /><br />But slowly she discovers that on the way to the perfect life, she lost the best part of her old life - especially her old friends (which she alienated on her climb up the corporate ladder), some of her values such as loyalty and love...<br /><br />While the book is definitelly a fluffy, fun book - it does manage to examine what makes up a 'perfect' life, and whether uts worth the price we pay for it...
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout video. Jillian is easy to follow and does a great job explaining what to do and what not to do. I really like the option of high or low impact in the same session so you can visualize the difference. You also get a great workout in a short period of time which is especially nice if you are 'too busy' to work out, anyone can find 20 minutes in their day to get in shape.
031606792X|1.0|The Twilight series went from an entertaining romance story worthy of suspension of disbelief to hackneyed horribleness in the space of a couple of hundred pages. At the end of the Bella's first section of Breaking Dawn, I threw the book aside in disgust. And it only got worse from there. The one month pregnancy! The vampire spawn with an atrocious name! The degradation of Jacob, who becomes lapdog to a child! (For a book that goes so far out of its way to stick to conservative mores like no sex before marriage, the suggestion of a pedophiliac relationship is surprising -- and pretty gross, too.) The lack of development in Bella's becoming a vampire! The simplification of the Edward-Bella relationship! The introduction of so many vampires who end up lollygagging aimlessly in the meadow for pages on end! The absolute lack of sacrifice entailed on the part of, well, anyone! The abandonment of conflict (among characters as well as among thematic tensions such as community vs. self, love vs. morality, goodness vs. self-interest, etc.) in favor of nauseatingly saccharine resolutions! I hate the over-use of the exclamation point, but this book was so bad that it deserves it. What a disappointing end to a series that previously was such a delight.
B001GKYBX0|5.0|I've waited a while to write this review because this is one of the rare albums that grew on me with repeated listenings. At first I liked the more straightforward songs -- \\"Sing the Changes,\\" \\"Highway,\\" \\"Light From Your Lighthouse,\\" and \\"Sun is Shining\\" -- and didn't greatly care for the rest. But after listening to it all the way through a few times, I've come to appreciate the album as a whole, and like the White Album, I wouldn't wish any song absent or different. This is truly one for the ages.<br /><br />In a way, this album reminds me of John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" because many of the songs sound passionately autobiographical (though they don't get into names or specifics as John's sometimes do). I agree with the reviewer who said that John would have liked this album best of all Paul's solo work. That Paul's traveled such a roller coaster track of dizzying ups and sickening downs over the past 40 + years and has come out with this excellent album in his 60s is simply amazing.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying the LP issue of this album (already out of print, so hurry and find one!), which has, in addition to a beautiful package, the warm and immmediate sound that comes from 180 gram vinyl. If you put the vinyl on and turn up the volume, layers emerge that aren't nearly as apparent on the CD or digital versions. Give it some time and this album blooms like the flower that Paul said back in the 70's was \\"coming up.\\"

Is Bill Gates wealthy because he was born into the right family?

0312370849|4.0|I really liked this book. The descriptions were amazing. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down!     The author provides an excellent juxtoposition of stories. She did a great job telling two stories equally. Rather than diminishing one more than the other, the simultaneous storytelling worked very well. Sarah's story offered great constrast and perspective, almost as a commentary of sorts, to the modern-day story of Julia. The tie-ins worked beautifully. While vastly different stories, together they encouraged a high value of life, marriage, family, and understanding. Furthermore, this book informs readers about a lesser-known event in history. I have read several WW2 books and novels. This is the first that thoroughly depict the Vel d'Hiv.    This was a great study in contrasts, an argument toward the relevancy of history.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|I must agree with many of the reviews that have been written. The Boss seems tired is all that I can think of. I couldn't believe that it was even him. I have listened to it twice but I still just can't get into it.  The only song that I really like is \\"This Life\\". it takes you back to early 60's Beach Boys music.. but the lyrics are a bit fuzzy. he sounds as if he is mumbling. Bruce Springsteen has always been one of my favorites. as I must say my favorite Bruce album is \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" as well as his timeless classic \\"Born To Run\\". he was much more \\"alive\\" sounding. now, The Boss sounds tired. but needless to say I did however add it to my collection......[[ASIN:B00000255F Born to Run]]

B000002P74|5.0|OK, in my review for Skynyrd's Street Survivors I call that their best album. Well, it's hard to compare the Gaines version of Skynyrd with the King Version of Skynyrd, so I'll just go ahead and call Second Helping Skynyrd's OTHER best album! They really came into their own on this release. Prounounced is great, too, but Leon didn't even play bass on it (he had quit the band shortly before the recording of that album), so Ed King was hired to play bass. Thankfully, Leon came back before the recording of Second Helping and Ronnie Van Zant, ever so wisely, not only hired Leon back, but decided to switch King to guitar rather than fire him. The man was a genius. And King's guitar genius comes alive on Second Helping. Who can imagine Sweet Home Alabama, one of the most popular rock songs ever, without that famous picked intro? That was Ed King. The way that he, Gary Rossington, and Allen Collins interplayed their guitar parts was absolutely magical and orchestral! The whole album is one killer track after another. The horn arrangements were a perfect touch on Don't Ask Me No Questions and Call Me The Breeze, which features the greatest rock piano solo ever by Billy Powell! A total climax to the song! You just can't beat this album! An absolute must for any rock and roll fan!!!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|If you've seen the movie then you already know how gorgeous the music is. My husband and I love it so much, he walked down to the music version of \\"falling slowly\\" at our wedding.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|If Bruce Springsteen did something resembling punk, this is what it would sound like. But strangely, enough, even though they're from Jersey, The Gaslight Anthem actually finds Pearl Jam more their idol. Simply put, \\"The 59' Sound\\" is an album where you get what you least expected, and it's surprisingly good. Don't even try putting it into a box; they're blazing new territory here. \\"Great Expectations\\" for instance is a fast-paced anthem, while the highlight and title track \\"The 59' Sound\\" is a mid-tempo rocker that is a mix of modern and alternative rock. Singer and leader Brian Fallon also holds the album together with his distinct vocals, helping give the band their original sound. His voice is rough around the edges, sounding bluesy at times, but it makes the album.<br /><br />Lyrically, the band also scores high marks, mixing originality with a striking sense of catchiness, especially when it comes to their often blazing choruses. I'm still singing \\"Well you ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night.\\" The album also seems to have the loose theme of a Jersey summer. TGA also loves that old time rock n' roll, giving tribute to Buddy Holly and the day the music died, Miles Davis, Tom Petty, among others. The album starts drifting off towards the end, but regardless, it is a great listen from start to finish. There's several strong tracks, and it makes for great and original rock. Certainly one of the most promising of 2008, check out The Gaslight Anthem and their \\"59' Sound,\\" and odds are you won't be disappointed with these Jersey Rockers.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved it.  We've both been reading it profusely since we share a love for all things Calvin and Hobbes.

B001BKG9RQ|4.0|There are a few clunkers on this CD but it is ultimately enjoyable.    If you are a big Pink Floyd fan, you will enjoy it.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is a hardened version of the older Western \\"sidekick\\" movies we grew up enjoying.  Ed Harris is marvelous as the itinerant Marshal for hire and Viggo Mortensen is absolutely perfect in his role as the devoted Deputy.  The gunfight sequences are realistic and exciting.  The photography and scenery are stunning. The humor also provides a brief but enjoyable respite. It could be categorized as a \\"thinking man\\"s Western\\" as the ultimate ending is satisfying but not exactly in the mode of a normal western.
0192853619|3.0|Gowers, in [[ASIN:0691118809 The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]], makes the rough but useful distinction of 3 kinds of mathematics: the algebraic, the geometric, and the analytic (where 'analytic' is not used in the philosophical sense but in a sense derived from the mathematical branch called 'analysis'). In the book under review, Gowers favors the geometric and the analytic, giving the algebraic only perfunctory attention.    I read the book because I like Gowers' approach in the Princeton Companion and I was curious what he had written here. The book has a very limited point of view and is as likely to disappoint as delight, depending on the type of mathematics the reader is inclined to enjoy the most.
0515141429|4.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and I picked it up on a whim. I expected a nice mystery and good way to spend my Christmas break. I read into 70 pages and I wasn't bored (some other reviewers claim the first 100 pages or so are dull). I kept reading and then new plot events occur that shoot the story into a new direction. You meet great characters and even have that \\"thing\\" inside your mind that automatically knows how to picture the characters and hear how they talk.    The setting is very small and I had a little trouble imagining the actual size of Margrave, Georgia. It says it's 14 miles long, but the way he describes Jack walking from the suburbs to the police department in ten minutes (the suburbs and police department are on opposite ends of the town), I was a little stumped. Maybe I missed something, I dunno.    I'm not going to go in the plot, look to the summary below the book price and figure it out there. If I restate it here, it'll just be filler. Basically, Jack meets Roscoe, this girl who works at the police department. They become romantically involved, almost so much that I really did not care for most of their scenes and ended up in me resenting her. I'm not a fan of romance however, so my opinion might be biased.    The small town is going to be naturally small in population, but good lord does Mr. Child give such a chilling feeling to the town. He continually adds that the town is deserted on Main Street and no one is outside. You literally feel you are the only in the town aside from the characters that are involved in the story. This may be a good or bad thing for some people, but take it as it is.    That's all I can say right now. I enjoyed the book from its start to its epic final showdown. Also, look out for this little word Mr. Child seems to use fanatically: \\"shrugged\\". I read a review stating this and it seems it is true. The word is used nearly obsessively and if you nitpick at it like I did, you could really get frustrated. Hopefully you aren't the type of person like I am that gets sidetracked from the story by disbelief of the word being seen, again!    Pick up the book; it's a great start to a series and only gets better from here on out.

0515142247|5.0|I started this book with little in mind. I had read Killing Floor a week prior to this and in my mind I had an idea of what the second novel would hold within. A light-read with a heavy romance between the main character and a broad he meets. Boy, was I wrong about this installment. Mr. Child follows up with a story that takes some getting used to and understanding but soon enough you can't put it down. You HAVE to know what will happen to Jack.    Basically, the book starts off fast. Reacher (the main character) is helping Holly, an FBI agent located in Chicago. She hurt her leg and carrying her laundry out from the laundromat has proved more troublesome than ever. Reacher lends a hand and shares the butt of a gun in his gut from a mysterious man who forces both of them into a car that speeds away from Chicago. Reacher has just been the victim of the old proverb: \\"wrong place at the wrong time.\\" Only, Reacher soon realizes Holly is not just your ordinary FBI agent.    The first 100 pages or so are very interesting. They speed by fast as you you need to know what happens. Reacher causes an epic fight in the first 100 pages or so and you are locked in. However, it starts to drag when the two of them are finally prisoners at a militia camp in Montana. It got to a point where I was questioning myself. \\"Should I stop?\\" It wasn't leading anywhere and frankly, I was a tad bored. I had other books on my mind.    I decided to keep reading and I am glad I did. The book picks up and the last 100 pages are so thrilling and so suspenseful, you can't help but keep the book plastered in front of you. It finally finishes in a \\"bang\\" and ends almost abruptly leaving you hungry for more. The mysteries within the book are surprising however I was picking up on some clues in the beginning and analyzed them to conclude the mysteries and on some I was right and others wrong. In a way, the end of the novel also leaves you a little shocked as the question \\"Who is it?\\" is finally answered.I'll be picking up Mr. Child's next installment soon. Die Trying was an amazing sophomore attempt and is showing bright things for this author's future. And judging from his large array of installments in this series currently, I'd say Mr. Child will be writing Reacher novels for a long time to come.
031606792X|5.0|This book and the first one were my two favorites. In New Moon, it just took too long for Edward to come back.  Breaking Dawn was the first book in a long time that I just couldn't put down and stayed up reading until the wee hours of the morning! I loved how different it was from the others and the ending was absolutely PERFECT in my opinion.
B00068S41I|5.0|I read the book and had a copy of the movie.  Somehow the movie got misplaced and I was heartbroken -- as I had been loaning it out to my colleagues who work in the Senior Care profession.  The story carries a deep message for those working with Alzheimer's patients - LOVE.  I could not readily find this movie on VHS and securing a copy via AMAZON was a true blessing. Thanks!
B001HN697W|4.0|Seeing current movies these days is a challenge with a very active toddler.  When Valentine's Day came around, we dropped our son off with my parents and I let my wife pick the movie.  She of course picked the \\"vampire movie.\\" Which is why I love my wife.<br /><br />As a big fan of Kate Beckinsale and the World of Darkness role-playing game, the Underworld series quickly became a favorite.  It featured big budget special effects, lots of PVC and leather, and plenty of pouty vampires.  It also featured a battle between vampires and werewolves, a concept that was so prominent in White Wolf's World of Darkness series that it sparked a lawsuit.<br /><br />Despite the lawsuit, Underworld continues to forge its own path, such that it now has prequels.  You know your movie franchise has made it when executives are willing to pay to produce what is essentially a history book.  Fortunately, this bit of history is actually worth watching.<br /><br />Werewolves and vampires have always been a bit of a mixed bag in Hollywood.  The fact that Dracula could turn into a wolf seems to be one of the less plausible aspects of vampirism that were dropped in favor of the Ricean pouty goth. Thus the ability to transform into a wolf is exclusively the domain of the werewolf.  But it wasn't always this way.<br /><br />The vrykolakas, draws its name from \\"vryk,\\" meaning \\"wolf\\" and lakas, meaning \\"fur\\" in modern Slavic languages clearly meant \\"werewolf.\\"  Vrykolakas in other countries, however, is used to describe vampires.  This is because of the aforementioned ability of a vampire to turn into a wolf, which can be strictly interpreted as meaning that all vampires are actually werewolves.<br /><br />Underworld: Rise of the Lycans turns this confusion into a plot.  In short, vampires and werewolves are descended from the same bloodline, but the vampires have risen to the role of aristocrat while werewolves are little more than beasts.  Or at least, that's what the vampires believe.  To that end, Viktor (Bill Nighy) the vampire lord treats domesticated werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen) as his foster son, giving him blacksmith duties that ensure werewolves don't transform with inward-pointing spiked collars.  But Viktor's benevolence has limits, and when he discovers that Lucian is having a dalliance with his daughter Sonja (the delectable Rhona Mitra, who still isn't quite Beckinsale but comes pretty darn close), he teaches Lucian a terrible lesson.  What Viktor underestimates is the kinship that Lucian has with his wilder brethren, a kinship that will spark class warfare.<br /><br />Rise of the Lycans is basically what you get when you give a serious goth injection to the elves from Lord of the Rings, rehash the plot from Romeo and Juliet, and steal the feudal arrangement of vampires and their human \\"cattle\\" from the World of Darkness series. Nobody speaks in contractions.  Everything is viewed through a dark blue lens. And lots of limbs get hacked off.<br /><br />The real story here is the werewolves.  It's their class struggle, after all, and the movie never shies away from the dire consequences of the characters' actions.  There is a high enough body count on both sides to make Shakespeare proud.<br /><br />Vampires.  Werewolves. Vampires and werewolves killing each other. Two star-crossed lovers bound by their family allegiances and the curse of their blood.  What more could you ask for in a Valentine's Day date movie?ord treats domesticated werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen) as his foster son, giving him blacksmith duties that ensure werewolves don't transform with inward-pointing spiked collars.

B000WZ8RGC|4.0|I like Avril Lavigne. She seems to be an above average pop singer. This album was pretty well done I may say. As far as the songs go, she has performed in a few tv shows-- one being Private Sessions on A&E-- a sunday mornignt talk show that airs at 9am every sunday. On March 1, A&E will be airing a Best of Show which will include interview highlights and performances from a selection of our A-List guests from Seasons 1 and 2.
1416594884|3.0|Present-day Hamburg.  A strange, emaciated man follows a hulk of a Turkish boxer.  Banker Tommy Brue receives an enigmatic invitation.   And a beautiful, idealistic social worker named Annabel binds them inexplicably together.  What secret do they share?  Or do they even know what that secret is?  Meanwhile, a razor-sharp Gunther Bachmann of German intelligence is hot on their trail.    While this story has the makings of an action thriller, it is rather an intricate character study of these four main characters.  Only at the very end is there a very brief action.  This being the first Le Carre novel I've read, I expected something different, i.e. a lot of action.  Le Carre's book focuses instead on the characters and the mysteries they've wrapped themselves in.    The ghosts of the Cold War haunt their living descendants, and the stranger, the banker, and the social worker form an unlikely alliance.  They all seek a personal redemption from their current lives.  The stranger wants the banker's money, the banker wants the social worker, and the social worker wants to save the stranger.  Had banker Tommy Brue not been in love with Annabel I would have found it impossible to believe his behavior; I still not totally convinced.  But perhaps.    Overall, it was a well-written drama (not an action-thriller).  If you enjoy character studies, then get this book.  If you want thrilling action, look elsewhere.

0156030209|5.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />The book is divided into three parts.  The first part of the story, 91 pages, takes place in India.  This part had some interesting thoughts but was not as exciting as the second part.  Pi is an Indian boy whose father manages a zoo.  We learn some things about animals.  Pi gives examples of how comfortable and apparently happy animals are living in a zoo.  Pi wants to be a Christian, Hindu and Muslim all at the same time.  When others tell him he can't do this, he has some interesting arguments for them.  He also has some interesting logic about a few other religious beliefs.<br /><br />The second part is the family traveling by ship to Canada with some zoo animals.  The ship sinks, and Pi is the lone human survivor who ends up on a lifeboat with some animals including a Bengal tiger.  After awhile, all the animals are dead except the tiger.  Pi and the tiger survive on the lifeboat for 227 days and finally drift to the shores of Mexico.  This part is 190 pages.<br /><br />The third part is 31 pages.  The authorities ask Pi what happened, he tells them.  They don't want to believe it and ask him to tell a different story, without any animals in the story.  Therefore, Pi tells an alternate story about his lifeboat journey which takes 9 pages.  The question is raised as to which story they want to believe.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />A lot of reviewers get into philosophical and religious discussions about this book.  Some of the debates compare choosing which lifeboat story to believe in and choosing which religious ideas to believe in.  I can see that being of interest, but it wasn't the major draw for me.  My reason for recommending this is \\"the story about the tiger in the lifeboat.\\"  I've never read anything like it, ever.  It was fascinating, enlightening, entertaining; and while I read it, I believed that it was true.  Afterwards, I grudgingly reminded myself that this was fiction - entirely made up, but I still wanted to believe that it was true.  I loved the boy's conversations and actions with the tiger during their days at sea in a lifeboat together.  Think of it as a fun adventure for young adults.  The boy has a wonderful attitude and amazing cleverness that he uses to survive with the tiger.<br /><br />If you're interested in some religious/philosophical debate about the book, you might consider the customer review by J.C.

B000687M48|4.0|First off, I am a major fan of the band. FALLEN is one of my all time favorite albums.. Now, my review after owning this since the first day of release... At this price, it is a steal.. at the original price I paid a couple of years ago, it was still a deal.. But in my opinion -- when you buy this, throw out the CD.. the mix is horrible! Same concert on the DVD, but there is no doubt when you listen, they are different mixes. The DVD is much cleaner and distinct. The CD hurts to listen to. The performance deserved much more on the CD than it was given. When I bought it, I took it back because I thought the CD was defective! Got another then. But as I soon learned, it suffers horrible from the compression. The band is so powerful, and the drummer is amazing, but everything is bound together so tightly that nothing stands out in the mix. Vocals are buried. My advice is to buy this and just listen to the DVD. It is incredible.. but shame on the person or persons who let this go out with such a horrible CD version (why didn't you just use the same mix for both?) I give this 4 stars instead of 5 for the crappy CD.. BUT BUY THIS!!!

061891868X|5.0|The book of Smolin is a delightful presentation of what theoretical physics has been up to in the last centuries, and of the troubles with it nowadays. As an insider (he is a distinguished theoretical physicist active for many years in string theory, among other things), he gives a lively description of a strange state of affairs, where a particular approach to particle physics, though still incomplete and not supported by experimental confirmations, has come to be described as THE ultimate theory of everything; and how this made nearly impossible for a young physicist to build a career on different, even promising, approaches, which for this reason have been abandoned (should we say ignored?) in the last 30 years. However, you will not find here the ideas of a polemic writer, or a string-hater! You just will find a honest discussion by someone who loves science, and respects it. Many open answers for insiders, and a wonderful fresco for the cultivated outsider. Higly recommended to the strings community.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kerns Goodwin is my favorite contemporary writer, bar none, and her sensibility seems perfectly suited to a study of Lincoln--they share more than just historical interest.

You're suppose to be giving me a refund for the book I paid for and never received.  Do you all communicate down there?  I guess you're no different than any other corporation- no communication between departments.  Running by the seat of your pants.  Sad what we've become- so disconnected from reality.  So I guess I'll tell you again.  You stink.  I won't buy from you any more.  And I'm spreading the word.  I'm telling everyone I know never to buy from Amazon.  We're better off buying books from Wal-Mart or Target.  At least we're assured we'll walk out with our book after forking out the money for it...unlike Amazon.

B0013LPS8Y|5.0|WAR was a huge album for U2. It established them as one of the few bands that mattered. The level of artistic expression and political activism through music that this album represents is truly remarkable. This entire package is beautiful, featuring an excellent essay, notes from guitarist The Edge, rare photos and original cover art from the singles. To my ears, the remastering job is excellent, although audiophiles will no doubt find plenty to complain about (loud sound, sonic compression, etc.) . Five stars for the original album, four for Disk 2. Most people won't have much use for the bonus disk, but for the true U2 fan, it's a real treat.<br /><br />Disk 2 Breakdown:<br /><br />1) \\"Endless Deep\\" (B-side of \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\") - an atmospheric instrumental that foreshadows the lush guitar textures found on their next album THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE. The bass guitar gives the song an ominous post-punk edge. Cool sound, but ultimately deserving of its B-side status. ****<br /><br />2) \\"Angels Too Tied To The Ground\\" (previously unreleased) - a leftover from the WAR sessions, this track was finally completed in May 2008. It definitely has that WAR sound, especially in the keyboards, which are great. The song itself, featuring a waltz beat, sounds fairly unique to U2 and it's been treated with a lot of studio polish. Bono's vocals lack the crystalline quality of his earliest recordings, so they were probably added on in 2008 (after years of smoking and shredding his vocal chords). ****<br /><br />3) \\"New Year's Day\\" (7\\" single edit) - nice to have this track, but rarely if ever would I choose this truncated version over the full album one. 7\\" single length - 3:55. **** (original album length - 5:35. *****)<br /><br />4) \\"New Year's Day\\" (USA Remix) - an interesting version with some different lyrics, this track begins with those lonely, haunted keys before the bass and drums kick in. This track isn't quite as good as the definitive album version and the editing is rather sloppy in a few places but it's still very moving and very cool. ****1/2<br /><br />5) \\"New Year's Day\\" (Ferry Corsten Extended Vocal Remix - previously unreleased) (9:41) - if you dig 80's techno you'll probably go for this. More than just run-of-the-mill techno, it incorporates an actual song - it's surprisingly good and you can dance to it. ****<br /><br />6) \\"New Year's Day\\" (Ferry Corsten Vocal Radio Mix - previously unreleased) (4:36) - basically the same thing as track 5, just shorter and with a slight Depeche Mode sound. ****<br /><br />7) \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" (Long Mix) (5:55) - This was never my favorite U2 song, mainly because I thought the \\"beat as one\\" idea was already a cliche when this came out. But it's actually a really great, sexy dance song and worthy single. This version gets a little bit weird and freaky in places - way cool. *****<br /><br />8) \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" (USA Remix) (4:23) - I never listened to these remixes much back when I had them on vinyl and I found this version in particular to be a turn-off - especially the hyper-edited intro (heart!-heart!-heart!-heart!-heart!-heart!-heart!-heart! beat aaas oooooooooone!) It gets especially tiresome if you listen to remixes of the same song back to back, so I would recommend breaking them up and using individual tracks for mix CDs. ***1/2<br /><br />9) \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" (Club Version) (5:42) - cool piano and effects - a superior remix that shows off a cool European dance style. ****1/2<br /><br />10) \\"Treasure (Whatever Happened To Pete The Chop)\\" (B-side of \\"New Year's Day\\") - a very old U2 song they played live even before signing to Island. A very cool, intense rocker, it was left off of BOY due to stylistic differences. The Edge relates a very amusing back story about this track in the album notes. ****<br /><br />11) \\"I Threw A Brick Through A Window/ A Day Without Me\\" -  tracks 11 and 12 were recorded live in Belgium, July 1982. This is a tough, taught version of \\"Brick\\" that immediately segues into a brief drum solo before launching into a fine \\"Day Without Me\\" in front of a very enthusiastic crowd. It's great to hear Edge's chiming guitar on this upbeat yet spacey track from the BOY album. *****<br /><br />12) \\"Fire\\" - killer version. *****\\"Day Without Me\\" in front of a very enthusiastic crowd. It's great to hear Edge's chiming guitar on this upbeat yet spacey track from the BOY album. *****     12) \\"Fire\\" - killer version. *****

0452289963|5.0|I was recently divorced, then my Mom died, plus other issues. Before this I had meditated read many books on Zen that sounded amazing to me, I could talk it. But didn't walk it.  Mr. Tolle's book found me at a time when I really needed it. It really put it all together and it became that meditation was now just presence. But instead of a mantra or something to focus on I feel a connection to G-d and nature that is incredible.  Mr. Tolle also shares many tools for living my life. \\"Take responsibility for the only thing you can take responsibility for, which happens to be the only thing that really matters:  Your state of consciousness.\\" Oh my G-d what a truth. As bad as anything could in reality be, if I keep presence and accept the fact that it is bad but I don't need to feel bad about it, I can be more than OK.  This is a power tool for dealing with so many as in all aspects of life.  Learning about my \\"pain body\\", seeing it for what it is. Taught me how to not let it light up and interact with others pain bodies.   How the ego in most cases is ruining our lives and has made man's reputation on this earth a disaster. Thus the reasoning I am sure behind the title and now my quest, to create a new earth. One where we can all see the love in each other.   Thank you Mr. Tolle for presence a much appreciated state of mind and the ability to see the love in others eyes and not my fear reflected.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|PLOT  An old Korean War veteran and long-term employee of the Ford production plant, recently made widower, contemplates what's left of his life in outer-suburban Detroit. He has his well-meaning but ungrateful and incompetent children - and his lackadaisacal, expectant, spoilt-rotten grandkids...    ...but...    ...he also has the lively foreign family who has just moved next door...and his precious 1970s hotrod...      REVIEW  I'm not sure where to start...but, as usual, I'll aim for sharp and concise.    Clint Eastwood has ripened with age, in terms of both directing and acting. To say that \\"Gran Torino\\", supposedly his last effort on both fronts, is thereby his greatest achievement, is hardly a stretch. Eastwood's directing demands attention from the audience at every turn, while his portrayal of the central character either cracks a smile on your face or makes your teeth grind...or both. From the supporting cast - and supporting crew behind the seens - he demands, at the very least, a raw and earnest performance.    Nevermind the racism of the central character, nevermind the simplicity of the picture - all elements are inhabited with a sense of perfection, and the dialogue is exemplary. So many films could learn a lesson from the dialogue...    \\"Gran Torino\\" runs long, as does heavyweight peer \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\". But whereas during \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" I checked my watch - just the once, mind you - time LITERALLY FLEW during \\"Gran Torino\\".    This movie is gripping...mesmerizing...and, like Eastwood's other recent hit \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", as observed by John Walker in Halliwells (2006-2008), it also \\"...moves in unexpected directions...\\"
B00008XEOI|5.0|Not only is the lion king one of my favorite movies ever, but this set is phenomenal.  The 9 lithographic prints are mind blowing!  They look completely hand drawn, and come with a certificate of authenticity explaining what they are.  I'd like to say that one of the more produced looking photos of this set doesn't show the prints as they really are, they look a million times better than what that one picture shows. It also comes with a decent sized, colorful book telling all about the making of the lion king, and of course, the DVD itself.  I'm so glad that i have such a nice set of one of my favorite movies EVER!
B0006399FS|2.0|Man I wish U2 didnt listen to all the disgruntled fans back in the late 1990's saying what a bad album Pop was.  I believe that cd is criminally underrated.  Sure, not every song was a gem.  \\"Miami\\" has not withstood the test of time and \\"Playboy Mansion\\"'s references to OJ and Michael Jackson sound cheesy today.  But MOFO, Wake Up Dead Man, Please and others showed u2 packing quite a thematic punch and shaking up their songwriting formula at the same time.  But with all the criticism, it seemed u2 became afraid to take risks with their art.  So in the 2000's, we have two albums of u2 playing it safe.      2000's All That You Cant Leave Behind was a fairly strong album, though not very adventurous.  U2 certainly played it safe, but they crafted several songs that still soared.  Problems arose when u2 decided to play it safe AGAIN in 2004 with How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  On this release, there just arent any great songs good enough to overcome the lack of adventure and risk.  There arent any awful songs, but no really good ones either.  \\"Sometimes You Cant Make it On Your Own\\" was quite popular, but has anyone stopped to realize how bad the lyrics are?  \\"Tough  You think you've got the stuff  You're tellin me and everyone  You're hard enough\\"  Bono is capable of much better than this.    \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is another \\"highlight\\" of this album.  \\"OH...YOU...LOOK...SO...BEAUUUUUUTIFUL...tonite\\" is one of u2's weakest choruses and simply doesnt elevate the song at all.      \\"All Because of You\\" attempts to be a rocker and inject a little life into the album.  But this song proves that if u2 tries to \\"rock out\\" but they forget Adam and Larry and leave those two burried too far in the mix , it simply isnt going to work.  The guitar riff in the song is not strong enough or daring enough to carry the song without giving Adam and Larry their fair space.  Add to that Bono's voice in the chorus falls far short, and the song really is a disappointment.    Elsewherehearing Bono shout \\"we need love and peace, love and peace\\"  to the \\"daughters of Zion\\" just doesnt carry the punch that his anthems in the 80's did.    I read that at the end of the Vertigo tour, Larry spoke up with the rest of the band and stated that they needed to return to experimenting.  Seems like the band listened, because all indications are that No Line on The Horizon will feature a u2 again that isnt afraid of taking risks.  I firmly believe that another u2 classic is about to be unleashed on the world.  And to Bono and Edge:  luv ya both but in the future, always remember to bring Adam and Larry. We all learned the hard way that great u2 songs need all 4 of you.      UPDATE:  My belief that U2's next album (No Line on the Horizon) would be another U2 classic was once again dashed.  No Line is just as bland as Bomb.  Could this be the end?

B00000DHRZ|3.0|Americana by The Offspring is a good album but not as clever as Smash. The Offspring mix silly punk songs with deep rock tracks. Pretty Fly for a White Guy, She's Got Issues, Feelings, and The Kids Aren't Alright are the standouts. Ok album but could've been stronger. Like the album cover though!
B001EJYOBM|4.0|Don't know why FOX would consider canceling this one, it does a great job of expanding the Terminator mythos.  More cerebral than most shows on the air, and Summer Glau does an amazing job of being a \\"very scary robot\\" despite her less than intimidating physical frame.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have the standard verson of Band of Bothers on DVD. The Blu-Ray version is even better. Everything comes to live, the sound is just so much better. I can feel like I am right there, on the battle front. I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version of Band of Brothers, it is just outstanding. Buy it now.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|The British pop-rock band \\"Coldplay\\" has been with us for awhile, but not too long.  Within a few short albums and years however, they've become not only one of the most popular groups of all, current day, but each new LP brings not only joys in listening, but engenders more impatience for their next project among their growing fan base.  While my main fave sort-of most similar band has always been \\"Oasis,\\" and continues to remain so, if for no other reason than a more substantial body of work, \\"Coldplay\\" has been gaining ground.  I can honestly say that, besides this particular album, every other song from their previous releases I've heard, makes me like them more and more.<br /><br />In any event, anyone who has more of a listening and appreciation history with this band than me, will I think, love this and sales and media/Grammy exposure I guess, proves that.  It is a bit of an evolution from previous efforts I hear, but the direction these guys seem to be going, only builds my anticipation of their next release, while I work on discovering and listening to their past.<br /><br />On a recent \\"60-Minutes\\" story on the band, Chris Martin (lead singer/writer) explained that the band is always working on new material, and that the relative shortness of their albums, is intentional.  As I remember it, his explanation was that they would rather put out new material more often than allow fans to wait, and wait, and wait.  Which is all the case it seems for more and more bands these days, as they become more and more popular.  So, while I am disappointed in the relatively short album length here, under 45 or so minutes of music, if they put out new albums like this more often, all the better.  \\"Viva La Vida\\" is fantastic.  As I'm discovering their previous material to be.<br /><br />Whether the group is going in the \\"right\\" direction or \\"wrong\\" with this release, I'll leave to older fans who've liked/loved them from the beginning.  Listening to their old stuff however, it's not all that different from this from my perspective, and I can't imagine any true fan of the band not liking this a whole lot.  There isn't a bad song on this CD.  Some cuts are more impressive than others, but all of them are great in their own way.  Breaking this down track by track then, what follows are my general \\"newer fan\\" impressions after listening to the album several times.<br /><br />1) \\"Life in Technicolor\\"<br /><br />Fading in slowly with some cool \\"backwards\\" music sounds, but deliberately moving towards an ever more pulse-pounding and richer instrumental-only cut, with brief vocals, this is a great beginning.  All of it relates to the album's title track \\"Viva La Vida,\\" and while this opening track, in listening order blends into track 2 on the album, it seems to me that if a cut like this, mostly instrumental, could be added to most every other song, Coldplay could've easily made this whole CD twice as long.  With great music like this, I doubt any fans would complain.  While this cut and others may signal a move by the band towards more of a \\"U2\\" sound, while I'm not a super-fan of U2, I appreciate their overall body of work, and Coldplay only seems to enhance the genre in a more melodic and pleasing manner.  For me at least.<br /><br />2) \\"Cemeteries of London\\"<br /><br />This track starts out sounding kind of like a Peter Gabriel effort, and that general drift seems apparent throughout.  While starting out slow, this picks up speed, again sounding like U2 in many parts, but with a more substantial and rich background.  The melody here is hardly present or memorable, despite the addition in parts of great backing choirs (from the lead singer, who else?).  And while not one of the best songs on the album, it does fine for what it attempts to do.<br /><br />3) \\"Lost\\"<br /><br />The lack of melody is hardly absent here as might be so in the previous track.  This cut has \\"hit song\\" all over it, and this is one of the best on the whole CD.  It starts out with almost instant vocals, and the very strong melodies and various hooks and riffs.  The plaintiff soul-searching lyrics and general spirit of this is simply amazing.  There is also a great instrumental interruption near the end, sounding again like something U2, but also sounding a lot like Oasis.  And that can't be bad.<br /><br />4) \\"42\\"<br /><br />A single piano introduces us to the melody and lyrics, but soon is enhanced by backing instrumentals, adding depth, especially when those same instrumentals blend with the singer's exact notes.  Near the middle, this song changes directions abruptly, and drifts back again to a more harder Oasis/Radiohead sound, with only mixed results, for the softer beginning overshadows what mostly follows.  Returning to the beginning slower, more contemplative structure, but only at the very end, doesn't help much, and this is one of the weaker efforts on this album overall.  Still very good stuff however.<br /><br />5) \\"Lovers in Japan\\"<br /><br />I guess this semi-hit is, and will forever remain perhaps the most U2-sounding track on the entire CD, however, again, that is not to say anything negative about it.  With full backing instrumentation, this is simply excellent, from start to finish.  I'm not really sure what the heck the lyrics mean or are trying to mean here, even after listening to this several times, and even trying to discern meaning from the music video for this.  But it doesn't matter; this track is surely a highlight of this album.  I can only wonder why Coldplay doesn't extend their songs with more lengthy instrumental bridges within their work.  They might then reach a more progressive-rock audience, yeah, all of us old aging Genesis/Yes/Pink Floyd hipsters.<br /><br />6) \\"Yes\\"<br /><br />This is the longest song on the album, and is basically presented in two very different parts.  In the first, Chris Martin generally lowers his voice over rather simple chord progressions, but done within a darker mood, and violin and more substantial symphonic sounds add to the slide-guitar and other effects in a unique, but not entirely satisfying effort. This first half of the song generally sounds like something Peter Gabriel would put out or has already released.  The second half is again heavily riff-driven U2 sounding, and instrumental for the most part, except for some background vocals which again follow the song's melody very closely, with intentionally obscure lyrics it seems.<br /><br />7) \\"Viva La Vida\\"<br /><br />The title track, and what an absolute joy it is!  If one doesn't know Coldplay from the man in the moon, I'm sure most people will have already heard at least parts of this at one time in the recent past, since it is all over the radio, TV, etc.  Needless to say, it fully deserves applause as the best cut on perhaps Coldplay's best album.  The melody here is so strong, it puts other most current band's attempts at same, to shame.  The lyrics are haunting, and I'll be looking soon for a longer \\"mix\\" of this song, somewhere on the net.  An instant hit, this, and no surprise.<br /><br />8) \\"Violet Hill\\"<br /><br />Starts out very Pink Floyd-ish, but with a strong keyboards introduction, the vocals and then other instrumentals kick in (solid guitar riffs), and this is not only one of the highlights of the album, but is closest to a truly original Coldplay offering from my perspective.  It is superb, if way too short, which is kind of a criticism I have of the band in general for me.  This is probably the only song on the CD which doesn't resemble anything too strongly, which came before it as far as comparing it to other bands in my view, and from which Coldplay obviously takes its inspirations and influences from.  A rather traditional chord progression is highlighted in the latter half by some nice guitar work, and a calming vocal end.  As usual, the music video for this, like other previous and current band offerings, if you get a chance to see it, is great, and I'm so glad to see a newer group I have come to love (besides Oasis), put out such fine material, whether audio, visual, or both.<br /><br />9) \\"Strawberry Swing\\"<br /><br />One of the weaker, but still great cuts on this album, it reminds me of other favorite groups, too numerous to break down here, and while there really is no memorable lick or melody here, it's still a nice effort.  Nothing to dislike here.  It eventually seems to be a track which will continue one's interest in the group and this particular album, after one has listened to the obvious hits over and over.  Nothing spectacular, but well worth listening to.<br /><br />10) \\"Death and all His Friends\\"<br /><br />No lengthy instrumental introductions here, this dives right into vocals, backed by some simple guitar and piano work.  The piano picks up shortly and leads into more music than vocal, and in parts rises to levels which only make me wish for extended remixes, which may or may not exist as far as I know.  Another semi-long song on the album, this has an abrupt change generally midway in to another song within one, and various themes call back to others in the work as a whole, and I guess is a pretty good last song, leaving me (and probably other countless) fans of the band, old or new, wanting more.<br /><br />A long time ago, when I was discovering the band \\"Keane,\\" someone suggested I give \\"Coldplay\\" a listen or two or three.  After having heard this whole album, and remembering previous favorites from the band like \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Talk,\\" I'm wondering nowadays exactly what I've been missing, and how many other of their previous songs I've liked while listening to the radio, but ones in which I never connected the songs to the name of the band.<br /><br />I wish this Coldplay album was a lot longer, and the band in general more progressive, as it seems they, and this, want to be at times, but overall, this specific album is really a winner.  At this point and in the near future, I will be checking out and listening to previous efforts with interest, especially non-hit album cuts, and while, as a rather new \\"fan\\" of this band, I have various nit-pix, all of this particular work, is a wonderful experience.  Even the least cut here is still very good, and the hit or semi-hit tracks, are amazing.<br /><br />Present day, be here now though, I can honestly say that I haven't heard anything yet from this band, which I haven't liked or loved, with no real duds.  That is something which I can only say about some of my few all time favorite bands and performers, like Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd, Oasis, Peter Gabriel's solo works, The Who, and so forth.  Whether or not this work takes any drastic turns from their previous works, positive or negative, I cannot comment on really, being a relatively new devotee.  But while most of this collection seems heavily U2/Oasis influenced to me on a surface level, U2 being a band I've only generally liked and Oasis more comfortable and familiar with, Coldplay seems to have really captured that general synergistic sound and mixed it with obtuse but pleasing doses from other, similar British Pop/Rock bands.  And that is quite an achievement.  I really haven't heard a song to this day from these guys. which I haven't liked however, and this is quite a trick.<br /><br />A five-star listening effort if ever there was one, and I will not only be collecting previous material from the band, but will look forwards with great anticipation to their next album, as I guess all fans of the band, old or new, will be doing.entirely satisfying effort.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Have watched all the episodes except for 2 and enjoyed every minute.  This Blu Ray DVD is well worth every penny.  The only thing I wish was a little different is when they jump to different regions during an episode they should have made it more clear.
B00026ZG10|5.0|When I was little, I used to play the Super Nintendo game, based on this movie, which I still have. Because I enjoyed the game, my parents let me wach the movie. I like it better now because I understand the plot more. Everybody did an awesome job, including Jamie Lee Curtis who does an extremely sexy striptease! Arnold stars as Harry Tasker, a secret agent who is on a mission in Switzerland trying to get information about a terrorist that has stolen warheads. When he is at home, his wife named Helen and rebellious daughter named Dana think he is a boring computer salesman. Harry works for Omega Sector, that try to stop Salim Abu Aziz from setting off bombs in America. To add to Harry's problems, he thinks his wife is having an affair with a guy named Simon who claims to be a spy.  When Helen is on a fake assignment, set up by Harry, they are kidnapped by Salim and his men, and later, Harry finds out that Salim even kidnaps his daughter. This is extremely action-packed and I would really like to see a sequel some day! I highly recommend TRUE LIES!!!

0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a compelling character study set in a Nigerian village at the turn of the last century. The story chronicles the first encounters between the polytheistic Igbo people and Christian missionaries. Obligations to the gods, cultural taboos regarding twins, the disabled and death, and unanticipated pronouncements from oracular priests and priestesses all govern the tribe's communal decision-making. Strictly delineated roles for men, women and children and tribal titles granting tribe members privileges such as harvesting palm wine govern day-to-day life. Okonkwo, a young Igbo man hoping to better himself despite his shamefully indolent father, feels these pressures acutely but manages for the most part to push ahead in the tribal hierarchy without making waves. The tribe's routines are upset when a priest erects a chapel in the evil forest where twins and outcasts are sent to live apart from the villages. Predictably, things fall apart. As Oberieka, one of the Igbo elders, put it: \\"The white man is very clever. He came quietly and peaceably with his religion. We were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to stay. Now he has won our brothers and our clan can no longer act like one. He has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart.\\"    One of the things I enjoyed most about the book was its depiction of Igbo tribal rites and the way the author used conversations between Igbo elders and the Christian missionaries to explain the interrelationships between the pantheon of Igbo gods and the tribe's animistic practices. I feel like I now have at least a concrete examples of how a polytheistic African religion weaves in and out of daily life. That is not to say that the specifics of that religion left me unmoved. At various points in the story, I longed for someone to step forward and put an end to the violence against women, the practice of leaving unwanted infants to die in the forest, and the senseless sacrifice of innocent children, but was disappointed. Another thing I did like about the book was its explosive ending. I felt it resolved all the major plot turns, without tumbling into a predictable, overly tidy end. The bitterly ironic comment that concludes the story was a graceful end note.    I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting introduction to black African literature. In some ways, the book so closely mirrors a Greek tragedy that it's hard to forget you are reading a title common on high school world literature reading lists. On the other hand, it's an excellent read that can be enjoyed in just a few evenings and it's on those reading lists for a reason.
0142405787|5.0|I'm a grown-up. I'm supposed to read \\"grown-up\\" literature (which I do), but I cannot resist this Alex Rider series. The fifth book in the series, \\"SCORPIA,\\" is the best--meaning most twisted thrill ride of them all (and that's saying a lot!).<br /><br />It's weird that this \\"young adult\\" series follows a formula of sorts: bad guys/gals of some kind threatening some part of the world in some way with Alex Rider, a 14-year-old kid who brings them all down and thwarts their evil plans. Oh, throw in wildly imaginative ways for Alex to be killed and how he escapes them all! Nope, none of this is spoilers because each novel follows the formula, so-to-speak. It's how writer/creator Anthony Horowitz manages to get Alex out of his incredible situations AND make them believable, so-to-speak.<br /><br />The plot elements are so wild, so imaginative, so incredible that none of this should work, but it does. Each new novel in the series is a new challenge: Can Horowitz pull it off again? \\"SCORPIA\\" is simply the most amazing in the series.<br /><br />What is SCORPIA? It is an acronym for \\"sabotage, corruption, intelligence, assassination.\\" One of the eleven directors is Julia Rothman, a beautiful but deadly woman who recruits Alex into the organization. Yeah, yeah, he's been working for M16, Britain's intelligence organization, but now he's turning to the other side. SCORPIA has created an \\"invisible sword,\\" which it plans to use to kill thousands of 12-13 year old British schoolboys unless the United States meets certain demands, which of course they won't. How will Alex be part of this? Can he?<br /><br />Suffice it to say, he will escape an underwater cellar in Venice, BASE-jump onto the roof of a pharmaceutical building and miraculously escape being blown to bits, well, you get the idea. Fantastic goings-on in this book. Incredible escapes. But there's the ending. Oh my, Horowitz cannot be serious.<br /><br />Alex Rider. Anthony Horowitz. What a team! What a great read! \\"Ark Angel\\" is next!
B001NOMNZW|5.0|An enjoyable, fun film courtesy of a bigger budget, better production, stage and lighting, this is the best \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" film of the three.  The transfer on to Blu-ray is excellent in picture and audio quality and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment really went all out with this \\"Deluxe Extended Edition\\" release.<br /><br />With the previous two films debuting on the Disney Channel, \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\" was the first of the three films to go on the big screen and eventually having the largest opening weekend for a musical film ever earning $42 million in North America and $40 million overseas in its first three days of release.  Opening at #1 and also having solid sales with its musical soundtrack.<br /><br />One can say it's the typical teenage angst that we saw from the first previous two films but what makes \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\" so much better is the higher production values.  The film features one of the most ambitious sets, choreography, costume and stage designs, lighting and uses of color in a musical.<br /><br />And because the higher production values, it definitely heightens the enjoyability of the film.  From performances in the basketball court, outdoors at a college campus, a junkyard and more, the cinematography is really solid.<br /><br />And of course, everything translates well on Blu-ray.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and the picture quality is excellent.  In one musical segment titled \\"I Want it All\\" featuring Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans, I was just amazed by the sudden shifts of color and how amazing it looked.  The colors were just vibrant and after watching the film on Blu-ray, I had to see how different the experience of watching it on Blu-ray versus DVD.  The Blu-ray colors just were amazing and on DVD, it was good but not in the same vibrancy as the Blu-ray.  This segment just was a great example of good colorful choices on costume design and set design and there are many instances that really stick out in the film. Even in the non-musical segments, the outdoor and indoor segments were colorful and looked great on Blu-ray.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio quality is of course music-driven and music really comes alive with the English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  I did notice a few instances of rear channels being used during scenes with a lot of people but in most part, the film is dialogue and music driven and overall audio quality is also great.<br /><br />So, picture and audio quality for \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\" is fantastic!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />And this is probably where Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment really went all out in this DELUXE EXTENDED EDITION release.  You get a total of three discs, the first being the Blu-ray which is the extended version of the movie, the second being the Digital Copy and the third being the DVD copy of the extended edition movie.  Having not watched the normal theatrical version, I do know that the original had 112 minutes and this extended version is 117 minutes long.<br /><br />As for special features, this is where the Blu-ray shines.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Senior Awards - The crew felt that with the talent graduating from \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\", a yearbook was created with photos from present but also the cast having the ability to vote for \\"Best Dressed\\", \\"Best Comedian\\", \\"Best Couple\\", etc.<br />  * New Cast Profiles - This segment features the passing of the torch to the new characters: Matt Prokop (Jimmie Zara), Justin Martin (Donny Dion) and Jemma McKenzie-Brown (Tiara Gold).  With clips from their video reports, from beginning when they first started and eventually making friends with the original cast and interviews about the three becoming part of the popular trilogy.<br />  * Disney Live Network - The ability to include your photos into the \\"EAST HIGH SCHOOL\\" yearbook ala BD-Live and more.<br />  * Cast Goodbyes - Interviews with the cast and Director Kenny Ortega and everyone saying goodbye and being emotional during the final shot and much more.  The cast reflecting on their last chance to be with each other as a group.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - About eight deleted scenes with an introduction by Director Kenny Ortega who mentioned it was done because of pacing and how difficult it was to cut some of these parts.<br />  * Bloopers - These are not the same bloopers shown at the end credits, these are totally different.<br />  * Sing Along with the Movie - By enabling the sing along subtitles, you can watch certain songs and sing to them.<br />  * Night of Nights - A featurette on the prom and having to prepare for the number and learn the choreography.<br />  * It's All in the Dress - Creating the dream prom and the ideas on the prom dresses for the actresses.<br />  * Table of Contents - Similar to a year book, this section features photos and you can skip pages but also access certain special features and Easter Eggs.  You can go to previous or next page via remote, if you press up on each page with your remote and select on the photos for each page, you either can access a special feature (that is also listed on the special feature section) or get a East High Wildcats claw.These claws are hidden short video segments featuring behind-the-scenes footage not featured in the special features section. The hidden claws can be found on the following pages and you can access the following Easter Eggs:Page 2 - Crazy improv segment<br />  Page 3- Tiara vs. Sharpay segment<br />  Page 4 - Choreography segment<br />  Page 5 - Basketball rig triggering<br />  Page 6 - Basketball dance choreography<br />  Page 8 - Two Easter Eggs (prom advice from the cast and Ashley Tisdale and Chris Warren choreography)<br />  Page 12 - Two Easter Eggs (graduation dancing scenes)<br />  Page 13 - Ashley Tisdale/Sharpay easter egg<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Overall, I was quite impressed with this Blu-ray disc releae of \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\".  On the extended version of the film, I was quite amazed by the production values from the stage, set and costume design, the cinematography, the lighting and the Blu-ray disc transfer of the film and seeing how beautiful and colorful the picture quality was and how clear and live the music sounds, fans of the film and have a Blu-ray player are truly in for a treat.<br /><br />And to celebrate the \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\", Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment included the extended version on DVD and a digital copy disc as well.<br /><br />And the number of special features and Easter Eggs were also another positive of the Deluxe Extended Edition.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the previous two \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" films, one thing you felt when watching those films are \\"Disney\\" musicals.  Something you expected to see on the Disney Channel.  With \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\", because of the high production value, the film really looked extremely well and after watching the special features, you learn that the cast really had to go all out in learning the choreography and with this film being the cast's final film together, they went all out.<br /><br />Now, how did I feel about the music in this film?  I think with every \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" that I've watched, there were always numbers that I enjoyed and numbers that tend to stick in your mind.  But I have to say that this third film, the music was quite solid.

And to celebrate the \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\", Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment included the extended version on DVD and a digital copy disc as well.    And the number of special features and Easter Eggs were also another positive of the Deluxe Extended Edition.    If you enjoyed the previous two \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" films, one thing you felt when watching those films are \\"Disney\\" musicals.  Something you expected to see on the Disney Channel.  With \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR\\", because of the high production value, the film really looked extremely well and after watching the special features, you learn that the cast really had to go all out in learning the choreography and with this film being the cast's final film together, they went all out.    Now, how did I feel about the music in this film?  I think with every \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" that I've watched, there were always numbers that I enjoyed and numbers that tend to stick in your mind.  But I have to say that this third film, the music was quite solid.  Also, I think that the cast felt more at ease and were much more comfortable with their surroundings and were not as stiff in the choreography.  The songs were sung well, the choreography was great!    But thanks to the higher budget and better production quality, I believe that director Kenny Ortega had much more freedom and again, with this being the final film for the main cast, everyone gave their best and it showed!    A fantastic Blu-ray release and a must-own for \\"HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL\\" fans!
B000003NA3|3.0|As the title of my review indicates this is only for the not so faint of heart. I think you will either like this, or not like it. Not much middle ground. If I wanted to explore the Avant Garde, and had never done so I would not recommend this. I have never understood the fascination with Coltrane's experimental period. There is good jazz in this period, but I think there are much better choices then Coltrane Avant playing on this highly overrated set. These reviews are buy fans of Coltrane. And they should be taken as such. Tread carefully. Borrow this if you can before you decide to buy.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Dark, gripping and unique!<br /><br />Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family. His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.<br /><br />Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.<br /><br />Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.<br /><br />Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister-in-law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.<br /><br />So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.<br /><br />So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.<br /><br />In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.<br /><br />Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.<br /><br />Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister-in-law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.<br /><br />The first season of \\"BREAKING BAD\\" features a total of seven episodes.

The video quality is similar to a lot of dramas that are on DVD but because of the many outdoor scenes, the quality of the film is pretty good.

Enjoyable and showing the wit of Cranston and the cast joking of how Cranston likes to be pants-less.  Interview with the cast and crew.  And the cast talking about creator/writer Vince Gilligan is such a gentleman and so nice but his screenwriting for \\"Breaking Bad\\" is dark, shocking and twisted.<br />  * Inside \\"Breaking Bad\\" - A 30-minute featurette featuring interviews with Vince Gilligan and the cast.

White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.<br /><br />And that is what is so impressive with \\"BREAKING BAD\\" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.<br /><br />Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.<br /><br />Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.<br /><br />You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.<br /><br />This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.

B001D94L1Q|5.0|The year of 2008 marks Messiaen centenary (1908-1992), and many major labels have issued or reissued various Messiaen box sets. Among them, 2 sets stand out: [[ASIN:B000A2ACWO Messiaen Edition]] from Warner Classics/Erato and the current set [[ASIN:B001D94L1Q Messiaen Complete Edition]] from Deutsche Grammophon. They are both excellent. Significantly, both include very substantial booklets which contain useful background information of the music. The choice comes down to your financial resources and musical preferences, which will be explained below.    DG's Messiaen Complete Edition is easily the most satisfying choice. Not only because of its comprehensiveness, all of Messiaen's works in 32 discs, but also because of the very high standard of performance maintained in this big set. Indeed, many of the performances are either performed/conducted by the composer's pupils: Yvonne Loriod, Myung-Whun Chung, Kent Nagano, Pierre Boulez, or recorded/rehearsed in the composer's presence. The latter includes, notably, Argerich--Kremer's Thème et Variations, and [[ASIN:B000001G8W Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps]]. This collection even includes a piano-duet version of Visions de l'Amen in the last disc, played by Messiaen himself and his wife Yvonne Loriod. The only significant weakness of this set, in my opinion, is Roger Muraro's 7 discs of solo piano music. For that, you will want to get the performances from two Messiaen super-experts: Prof. Peter Hill(*) and Yvonne Loriod. However, let me emphasize that even this \\"major weakness\\" is really not that weak after all! Muraro might not be the most idiomatic Messiaen performer, but he has very colorful and supple touch and agile technique. And yes technique! Some pieces demand virtuosic technique: If you can't play 16th notes at 200 (per quarter note) in cadenzas and florid passages, don't even try Messiaen except in your own sound-proof practice room!    Yvonne Loriod's outstanding performance can be found in Warner's MessiaenEdition alluded above. The strength of this set includes: (1) Yvonne Loriod's performance of solo piano works, (2) Pierre Boulez's conducting of a few orchestral works and (3) A recorded radio interview with the composer in the last CD. The major drawback of the set, though, is that it does not include Messiaen's only opera Saint François d'Assise, which is included in DG's Complete Edition in a [[ASIN:B00000JSAO superb performance]] conducted by Kent Nagano, with an outstanding (dream) cast led by José van Dam's Saint François.    One significant benefit from the completeness itself is that \\"the whole is more than a collection of individuals\\". After going through the complete oeuvres, the developmental stages become much clearer. When one traces the composer's work chronologically, their connections show up naturally. Some examples: from Trois Melodies (1930) one senses immediately strong influence of Debussy's Pelleas; some traces of Fauré can be discerned from his early chamber music;(**) in many early songs, one hears themes of later instrumental works, like Vocalise-Etude (1935) in Quatuor pour la Fin du Temps (1940-1). There are many other examples. However, the joy of discovery is not unlike what I experienced a few years back, while going through Hanssler's [[ASIN:B00004WJLX Complete Bach edition]].    My recommendation is: if you can afford it, go for DG's complete edition while it's still available. It's not likely we will have another \\"complete edition\\" of any composer of such high quality any time soon. On the other hand, if you enjoy Messiaen's piano music as much as I do, you would really want to supplement this set with either Peter Hill's or Yvonne Loriod's recordings. This recommendation is especially urgent as it is a limited edition and most major European vendors, including DG's own website(!), no longer carry it.(***)    Most highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Messiaen's music.    ---------------  (*) Prof. Peter Hill, at Sheffield, isa Messiaen scholar/pianist and have prepared the recording with the composer in Paris. Regis used to carry Peter Hill's 7-disc box set but it seems to have gone out-of-print. Fortunately, Brilliant Classics has reissued the Hill discs. See comments below.    (**) Curiously, I have not read any scholarly assertion about this connection with Fauré. So the readers are advised to take this as a conjecture.    (***) If you are one of those budget-conscious music lovers, like myself, you'd really want to shop around for the best price. For example, check out amazon's EU sites. Other reviewers have useful suggestions as well.    ---------------  Addendum: After the first version was posted, I discovered Steve Benner's review, where he complains about Latry's organ performances. I found them admirable. However, if you are really into Messiaen's organ works, you don't want to miss Messiaen's own performance in [[ASIN:B000002SBX Messiaen par lui-même]] and CDs by [[ASIN:B0000V86LE Jennifer Bate]]. -- And by the way, Steve's review is recommended.
B000O75VSU|5.0|This album is so good. It's a shame it took me so long to get into the group. Once I did though this quickly became my favorite, along with Invisible Circles. If only the rest of their albums were easy to get they could become one of my favorite bands. Floor Jansen has an amazing voice! So powerful it can sent shivers down your spine.     Too bad this album ISN'T a sign of things to come since I just found out a week or so ago that the band called it quits. It's a shame too because it seems they were just getting great!
B001GKYBX0|5.0|Amazing recording, wonderful dark bluesy tones on the first record. Crazy hot beats on the the second. Blew-my-mind-man!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Ratatouille and The Incredibles still remain my favorite Pixar films. But Wall-E is still wonderful. Great story, very love-able characters (especially Wall-E of course).  The Blu Ray specs on this disc are fantastic. It's definitely a great disc to show off your home theater. The Digital copy is a great plus. Unless you just aren't a fan of family disney/pixar films, this should be a must-own for just about any Blu Ray collection.    ~G
0812550706|5.0|A co-worker recommended \\"Ender's Game\\" in 1995 and it didn't make much of an impression on me. I couldn't \\"Buy the premise, buy the bit\\", probably because I wasn't married with children at that time.<br /><br />Recently, I was looking for something to read and I noticed that the book had been revised. I had read quite a few favorable reviews, and I really liked \\"Pastwatch\\", so I began to wonder if I had missed something when I originally read the book.<br /><br />My daughter had been in a robotics program at school and I was amazed at the technical level that these kids were compared to my own childhood. When I read Ender's Game again, I realized that recruiting children to fight a war was totally realistic. If you have an attention span lasting for more that 20 seconds, the book is not wordy, awful, or vague as some reviewers have stated. Most likely, these readers prefer the dumbed down writing style of Dan Brown, which is more suited for the average reader.
B00005JMYI|5.0|The commentary track for Anchorman is filled with the same brand of nonsense appreciated by fans of the film, it will have you rolling.<br /><br />I finally got around to watching the film with commentary and it was a really fun ride. Rarely is the film itself discussed, instead questions about which cuss words/phrases will be \\"bleeped\\" out and random visits from unrelated celebrities fill the time.<br /><br />The biggest laughs come from the visit of a \\"bitter\\" Dave Koechner who rants about how he was cut out of the film and wants to re-edit it himself since he is now reduced to selling shoes on the side of the road with his children.  It was almost more enjoyable than the entire movie and literally had me crying.<br /><br />Just a shout out to those who don't make full use of the special features that come with their DVDs check out this commentary for a very \\"unique\\" experience.
031606792X|1.0|Again, I would never have made it to the 4th book if I didn't already have all 4 books and I absolutely hate seeing something that expensive going to waste. If Ms Meyer does offer books in the future, I hope she takes the time to read what people did not like about the books so that her next endeavor is much better.<br /><br />This is the fourth and final chapter of the Twilight Series. In this installment it was a tolerable read and there were aspects of this book I liked a little better, but honestly, nothing to write home about. But this is because, it seemed like a totally different book. All of the characters were different, so much so, that it was really strange and out of place.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with the other books was the lack of strong characters. While they still are not that strong or multidimensional as I would like the characters to be in a book they were slightly better. But......where did all the secondary characters go? Like the Cullens, we saw very little of them speak in this novel. Way too centered around Bella, Edward, Jacob, and Renesmee.<br /><br />Bella, our heroine, has always been a whiney, self centered, \\"woe is me\\" type of character. She actually had more strength to her in this novel but where did it come from? It bugs me that suddenly in this book our main character is so totally different that it leaves you wondering about the author. It leaves the reader to assume that being a vampire made her mature. Or that someone else wrote this book.<br /><br />Edward, was still a control freak, which in my book the way he acts is abusive, but here again, Ms Meyer has tamed him down some in this installment and he acts totally different with no explanation.<br /><br />Jacob, was still a bully in the first half of this book but suddenly became a pillar of strength instead of a hothead in the last half of the book. Again, the reader can only assume it may be because of A) his imprinting with Renesmee, or B) his role as an Alpha with his own pack.<br /><br />And as for his imprinting with the child and totally backing off from Bella, seems really weird. This imprinting with a child is really disgusting. This should NEVER have been done in a book, let alone, a teen book. It really does make you think, pedophile.<br /><br />There were two other things that \\"really\\" bugged me about this book. One was the name Bella chose for her daughter; Renesmee Carlie Cullen. It was bad enough her calling it \\"little nudger\\" but this name is quite honestly, the most ridiculous name I ever heard. It looks like the author was really struggling to put a name to the baby. In this reader's humble opinion, it is ugly and very awkward to pronounce. Plus, Bella made the decision all by herself, no input from Edward. I found this off as well. If she is so madly in love with Edward, wouldn't he have a say? But he stands in the back ground and says nothing???<br /><br />And while I am mentioning the baby, this plot line was so unbelievable it was laughable. First of all, if a vampire doesn't have blood, per say, doesn't breath, no beating heart etc., how can he have sperm to impregnate a human? Come on... that had to be the most unbelievable part of this book. While yes, I know it is a fantasy book, it still has to be believable, things that could happen if they existed, not something so far fetched that they couldn't even happen in a fantasy world. And it was a let down too, Bella never struggled with being a new born. Very disappointed in that. Bella really got everything she wanted with out getting one hair out of place!<br /><br />Secondly, the fact that Charlie nor Renee, tried to go see Bella when she was supposedly in the hospital in another state, gravely ill. This made the story very unbelievable. Parents that love their child as much as Charlie and Renee love Bella, would never sit back and take someone's word that she was being cared for correctly. Any normal, loving parent would move heaven and earth to locate their daughter and be by her side. This was so far off base it was laughable.<br /><br />While I felt the characters were better in this book, they weren't the same characters we were accustomed to in the first 3. This in itself, makes the author look very inexperienced or that she had a ghost writer.<br /><br />Bottom line here, Stephanie Meyer is really a terrible writer. I don't care if you are writing for teenagers, and this book, I think, goes a little far for that, you have to be a good writer, maybe more so.<br /><br />I honestly believe the only reason this series is so popular with the teens is because of the romance aspect of it. It appeals to them. An older reader, like myself, it does make you relive those days of a 17 year old and how the world was all roses when you were in love. It feels good. But the writing is so bad that it really makes that feeling murky because you are so disgusted with the writing, you want to trash the book. This book should never have been published.laughable.

Have served to vegans, vegetarians, lactose-intolerants, and omnivores and all have loved them! There's no need to qualify these treats by saying \\"they're vegan,\\" because they're just plain good. You can pipe the icing and make them pretty enough to serve at baby showers, birthday parties, etc. The basic vanilla and basic chocolate are always good, but the carrot cake cupcakes are divine.

B000PWQOB2|2.0|Thought it was the remaster of the original 1983 recording. It turned out to be a 2002 version with the retracked guitars. The master sounded overly dark with a plenty of bass and not enough details in the mid range. Couldn't enjoy neither the music nor the sound quality.
B001NFNFNU|2.0|Very powerful story that merits attention to yet another LAPD scandal....LMN channel level storyline perhaps, but big screen??? Imagine that Clint and Ron got the red carpet treatment for a below par screenplay.  Ken Burns would have done a much better job but then less of an audience unless they exaggerate all the blood spilling, electric shock therapy, and evil looks of the protaganists.  I liked the skating at work deal, Angelina just has to keep pursing those SCREAMING TOMATOE RED lips that distract from anything else going on in the scene and if anyone considers her a feminist because she is forced to work and a minister pretty much takes up her case, I dunno, not buying it.  I think this entire genre of \\"Where's my son/daughter/family member\\" is not striking the chord as much as desired, LAPD is prolly worse now...justice served selectively, minorities treated poorly unless Gloria Allred is sleuthing nearby.  Quite frankly, a woman with 6 kids should be home taking care of her family and she is just the wrong talent for this vehicle of compassion for a parent.  My sympathies to the family that endured such painful experiences.  I imagine they had no desire to dredge all that up again.

Horry is a very  delightful heroine, honest and very funny, and Rule  well, he is a gorgeous hero very smart and always ahead of the  game and he has a sense of humor too, I just love this book  I can read it over and over and not get tired of it.  I also like Arabella, Regency Buck, Black sheep, April Lady  and many more.

I've been doing the 30 day shred for about 5 days a week for almost a month now and I still get excited to work out each day!!  I stuck with level 1 for the first 3 weeks, but I noticed an obvious change in my endurance after about 4 or 5 workouts.  The first few days I wanted to die - I could hardly move!  But since then I just get a really nice burn and I can tell that it's really changing my body!
B0015AARJI|3.0|I don't understand why they make the controller so slick. I feel like I'm wearing contton gloves when using it.  Mostly I use the PS3 for Tiger Woods. I had to learn to hold the controller in the air, because the L2 and R2 buttons stick down so far that if I rest the controller on my leg for support my clubs change.  Also, in a short time all my controllers get a catch when you pull back the stick to hit. I'll pull back on the stick to swing but the stick catches causing me to hit the ball goofy.
0439023483|5.0|This was a fabulous book from start to finish.  I immediately got online to see when the next book comes out.  I wish I didn't have to wait.  This was my book pick for the book club I am in and everyone in my club thought it was fabulous as well.  All positive feed back there too.  Great book!!
B001H9MWW2|3.0|Very interesting album, but a couple tracks, like \\"Lost\\", sound like they were made with drum machines--not a good direction for rock music, I believe.  \\"Prospekt's March\\" doesn't add much (several of the tracks are just redo's of \\"Viva La Vida\\" tracks), but it still makes it nice to have a second CD after the 10 tracks of \\"VLV\\" are over with.
B001GQACGE|3.0|I think this CD is ok. I thought that it would've had more tracks. However, for the price of the CD - it was worth the purchase.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|This movie WAS a bit corny, but it's also very sweet. It makes you want to get up, dance, and sing along! I love the sing-a-long part of the DVD..VERY FUN!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I bought this for my daughter.  She really likes the Gilmore Girls (so do I).  It was a great buy.  We will purchase more Gilmore Girls seasons.  Thanks.

0767903862|4.0|I didn't finish reading the book so I can't give a complete review - the only thing I have to strongly suggest is that you read before landing in Australia.  Otherwise, you'll just wish you had read it before because you learn things about the country and its history that you are going to wish you had known while you were actually there. The little I did read was so witty and entertaining.  I wish I had read it all before arriving!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read the other reviews before purchacing and was convinced I should get it.  I love it!  It is short but effective, and with a new baby at home, that is exactly what I need!  Would definately recommend!
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The Ultimate Matrix Collection on Blu-Ray is good but does not score full marks.  Picture and sound quality are very good. However its missing the digital copy for Reloaded and Revolutions and the movie starts up immediately once the disc is inserted... really guys, it should load into the menu first.    Other than that I have the entire Matrix series on crisp clear Blu-ray... Woo Hoo.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video, as I read a raving review.  I am sooo glad I purchased this.  My future mother-in-law and I have been walking about 3.5 miles every other day for about two weeks.  I got the video in the mail yesterday and took it over with me for our daily walk.  We decided to go ahead and try the 30 day shred video instead of our walk.  Wow!  We were both sweating and our heart rate was up in no time!  We both feel like jello today, but are ready to go again tonight! I know that if we stick with this and eat healthily, we are going to be excited about our new bodies in 30 days!    Each level (I totally recommend beginning with level one, even if you think you are advanced) is only 22 minutes long, so it is perfect if you are a busy bee whom is always crunched for time!  I completely recommend this dvd...it is a worthwhile purchase!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|You will watch this movie for years and everytime you see it you will know how lucky you are to have a copy of it.    Story telling at its best with top-notch visuals.  I was never a fan of Miller's Comic work, not too pretty for me.  I'm more of a Michael Turner person.  But with this movie I became addicted to Miller's movies, I try to own everything he is involved.

B001J6NZGU|4.0|I had reservations about buying this movie since I heard it was an exclusive ALL FEMALE CAST. The truth is, it was so well directed and acted, that you always felt the presence of the MEN, even though you never see them.  A very entertaining funny and at the same time  touching film.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|The Emancipation of Mimi CD is incredible.  I have a Mariah greatest hits CD from many years back but I thought I'd give this a listen.  I absolutely love every song on the CD.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes her voice and likes to dance.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|I'm appropriating the quote from the ancient knight from the end of \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" after the evil guy drinks water from the cup that is not the holy grail, then quickly evaporates into a pile of skeleton dust.<br /><br />Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were in an excellent film thirty years ago.  [[ASIN:B0019L21GA The Godfather Part II - The Coppola Restoration]] whetted everybody's appetite, and as great as they both were in that film, they both went on to bigger and better roles, but they were never on the screen at the same time until 1995's [[ASIN:B000P0J0AG Heat]].(Pacino played \\"modern day\\" Michael Corleone and De Niro played \\"flashback\\" Vito Corleone in GF II). In Heat, which was a significant drop-off from the Francis Ford Coppola film, they had a single scene together.<br /><br />Did Jon Avnet think \\"oh, we can do better than THAT?\\"<br /><br />Well... maybe someone could, but this isn't that film.  Putting De Niro and Pacino in the room with this script and rolling the camera doesn't work any better than putting my two year old grandson in a room with paint and canvas and expecting a Jackson Pollock.<br /><br />These iconic actors simply do not fit this script.  Their \\"police buddy/partner\\" characters are street cops.  De Niro, 65, and Pacino, 68, both look their age, and no degree of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" allows me to accept these two post-retirement age acting icons as \\"street cops\\".<br /><br />Carla Gugino, luscious and 37, plays the love interest.  Does it matter whose?  Make sure the defibrillator is charged...<br /><br />The story is insulting.  It borrows from the \\"Keyser Soze Syndrome\\", trying to \\"surprise\\" the audience, who is deliberately misled in an attempt to make them believe the wrong thing before unveiling the surprise.  Now that I think about it, De Niro stars in another of my least favorite \\"surprise ending\\" films, Hide N Seek.<br /><br />Mr. De Niro would do well to be a little more selective in his scripts and Mr. Pacino would do well to take a look at Frank Caliendo's impersonation of himself, then take steps to NOT reproduce it. (I think Caliendo's point is that Pacino has played essentially the same exact character in every film since \\"Scent of a Woman\\".)<br /><br />Sorry - didn't like it.s impersonation of himself, then take steps to NOT reproduce it. (I think Caliendo's point is that Pacino has played essentially the same exact character in every film since \\"Scent of a Woman\\".)    Sorry - didn't like it.
B0000026WD|5.0|Fantastic of course. One of his best albums, but it's hard to find in stores. I was incredibly thrilled to find it on here, and in good condition as well. It's played great, and the booklet is in fantastic condition.
1401302378|4.0|This book is a quick read not because the text is large or the concepts are necessarily simplistic, but because it is well written and you can tell the author, Chris Anderson, takes a great interest in the topic.    The book does a great job of discussing some of the reasons why the internet and user reviews (like this one), iTunes, etc have changed the way we shop for and purchase products.  It is interesting as a consumer and would probably be even more interesting to someone in an industry affected by The Long Tail.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's not-necessarily-factual memoir is a gritty, gripping tale of his drug rehab. He provides a window into a life that is as foreign to most of us as Mars, and his recovery is nothing short of miraculous, but he does not do it alone.  Of course, he had some help in almost destroying himself, too, but his is not the voice of a victim at all, and his culpability helps make this book special. He assumes full responsibility for the disaster that is his life and refuses to blame his family or his genetics, although both obviously play some role in his addiction. He also refuses to give himself up to a higher power, as required by AA. It's an amazing journey, and his words echo his experiences with their mind-numbing repetition. Particularly enlightening is his constant need for more, more, more, and in the absence of drugs or alcohol, this applied to food, which his body isn't able to digest at first. Don't let the writing style dissuade you from reading an engrossing story that grabs you and doesn't let go.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show just gets better and better. Dexter is sweating bullets thru most of the second season because they have discovered all the bodies he has cut up and dumped in the ocean. The FBI has put together a task force to find the killer (Dexter) and it's a game of cat and mouse for most of shows. Keith Carradine is in most of the shows and although Dexter thinks he suspects him, the FBI agent just likes his opinions. Yes, that is the way it is with Dexter. Just when he thinks he is suspected, he finds the people mostly just respect him and want to know what he thinks. In other words, he always escapes punishment just when you think he is going to get caught. His love life is picking up speed too but then Rita thinks he has been cheating on her and dumps him. He starts an affair then with a sociopath and the tension rides high for the entire season. No matter what he does, we his fans are making excuses for any bad behavior on his part. He kills the serial killers because the courts can't convict them or find them. He doesn't cheat on his girlfriend until after she has broken up with him (he's silly enough to think when she says it's over that it's really over) and that is when he sleeps with the sociopath. Deb, his sister sets him straight. See what I mean...we should be hoping this serial killer gets caught...instead I am making excuses for him at every turn just like his girlfriend and foster sister Deb. Yes, there is something about Dexter that makes you want to turn him into a good guy, but if that happened, what would the show be about! The show has its humorous moments and it's just great! You can watch seasons 1 and 2 from netflix and season 3 from video on demand from amazon or direct tv if you don't want to buy the discs.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the first Blu-ray disc(s) that I have seen.  The content and narration are superb and the photograhy (certainly in 1080p) is stunning!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter has a code and he tries to stick to it. He only kills serial killers. While doing this he has a job in the forensics department of the Miami Police Dept. He also has a social life of sorts with his girlfriend and her two children. I was happy to see this show wasn't just about drugs and drug dealers as I thought it might be since it takes place in Miami. You don't much care what the police are doing though since you are mostly just waiting to see what Dexter is going to do next. He thinks he isn't normal (what serial killer is!) so he starts doing the normal thing and gets him a nice girlfriend with two children. He may be a killer but he sure is good to his girlfriend and her kids. He's also a true friend to his friends and foster sister Deb. No matter who he kills or what he does, you can count on this...sister Deb, girlfriend Rita, and his audience will be rooting for him and defending him to the hilt. The show has its humorous moments and it's just great! You can watch seasons 1 and 2 from netflix and season 3 from video on demand from amazon or direct tv if you don't want to buy the discs.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This was the album that changed everything that I thought I knew about music.  I had heard Hysteria and thought that's a pretty cool song.  That same day I went and bought Absolution and was blown away.    I had never in my life imagined music could be so great.  Sure I'm a huge fan of Pink Floyd and of course Zeppelin, and trust me MUSE is in the same category as these greats.  For anyone thinking about maybe getting this album, don't think just do it.  And while you're at it pick up all the rest.  Everything MUSE does is absolute gold.
B00000637V|5.0|With an all-star cast of musicians - including the Brecker Brothers, Jack Bruce, Tony Levin and Aynsley Dunbar - Lou Reed's third solo album was an ambitious rock-opera from the depths of the soul and with a heart beating rapidly from drugs, depression and depravity.<br /><br />Dark and brooding, Reed follows the fast times and brutal life of a doomed couple; this is the siren call to the abyss and heard from the shadows of burned-out buildings and ripped up sidewalks in an area that police will only tread with proper back-up.<br /><br />A planed stage adaptation was abandoned due to mostly negative reviews by critics an fan indifference. But the album has quietly emerged as a classic from a period when Reed created art on a fractured canvas that depicted those who thought they could manipulate the shadows of street life, but found out much too late that they were dancing into the abyss.
0743201140|5.0|Marcus suggests that we are each wired a certain (and different) way and we should put more effort into developing our natural strengths, rather than fixing our weaknesses.  Imagine Michael Jordan listening to criticism over his baseball skills as a young man, instead of being focused on improving his basketball skills.  Would he have become world class?  We all have something that makes us different and better than others around us.  What if we maximized the time we spent developing strengths, rather than fixing weaknesses?  Adopting a Strength-based life is a long journey and this book is the starting point.
B00006LLOG|5.0|Released in December 1972 and produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, the sophomore solo effort by Lou Reed delivered an incredible array of material, several quickly becoming signature themes to what was an already legendary career.<br /><br />Each of the 11 songs (clocking 36:40) of mostly new material - some had been demos for the Velvet Underground - is Reed as an expert storyteller, with the urban street being the scene after the 9-to-5 masses are home in the suburbs.<br /><br />The singles were Walk on the Wild Side (#16 on the 1973 Billboard Pop Singles chart) and Satellite of Love - with Vicious, Perfect Day, Hangin' Round and I'm So Free showing Reed's ever-changing moods.<br /><br />The band consisted of Ronson (g), Herbie Flowers (b), John Halsey (d) and Ronnie Ross (sax), with Bowie and several others on backing vocals. The album peaked at #29 on the Billboard 200 chart.<br /><br />This edition includes demo tracks for Hangin' Round and Perfect Day, with a hidden promo for the album. There are some highly-frustrating aspects to Reed's career, but the only drama here concerns the gamut of emotions he conveyed through the brilliant lyrics.
0790744295|4.0|Featuring a host of recognizable (if noticeably younger) faces and a snappy, cartoonish cinematography, CREEPSHOW is easily Stephen King's most enjoyable horror movie (to date).<br /><br />For one thing, it's intentionally funny.  Meant to convey the same stylism as a pulpy horror comic book, the scenes are sometimes filmed with the garish primary colors and the silly scopes that frame some of the gorier and more eccentric panels in the funny pages.  Red zig-zags, wavy blue lines, sickening green spirals -- it's trying to be scary, sure, but only because scary is also supposed to be fun.  In fact, one of the first scenes is a zoom in on a smiling Jack-O-Latern, a good-natured emblem of the playful spookiness that Halloween (and Stephen King) is (usually) all about.<br /><br />Six basic stories fill the fare here, so if something doesn't suit you, you can just chaw on popcorn for awhile and you'll get another shot in a few.  Here they be:<br /><br />FATHER'S DAY - Back from the dead tale with some gruesome deaths and exposition that's as thick as toothpaste.  No supsense, no gimmicks, just a lot of death and Ed Harris doing what appears to be the Funky Monkey.  The 80's never looked so hideous.<br /><br />THE LONESOME DEATH OF JORDY VERRILL - Stephen King takes the helm as the lead, a bumbling hick with an overactive imagination and a smoking meteor in his backyard.  King manages quite a feat here: he's hilarious and kinda touching.  I mean, genuinely funny, which is amazing since every other performance I've seen him give has been awful.  It's especially notable, since the humorous and endearing performance makes the ending all the more disturbing.<br /><br />SOMETHING TO TIDE YOU OVER - Leslie Nieslen isn't fooling around, for once.  Instead, he's getting revenge on his wife and her lover -- Ted Danson giving a respectably restrained performance.  Well-paced and to the point, this segment was the point (when I was watching as a kid) where I realized I was watching a HORROR MOVIE.<br /><br />THE CRATE - Easily the best of the six, a mysterious crate and its grotesque contents causes havoc on a small college campus.  Featuring one of the greatest and most enjoyable horror movie performance I've ever seen by Fritz Weaver, who plays the hysterical professor, Dexter Stanley.  The most accomplished and satisfying segment of the bunch.<br /><br />THEY'RE CREEPING UP ON YOU - Wealthy germophobe, Upson Pratt, showers doom and gloom on people from his hermetically sealed penthouse apartment (a la Howard Hughes, I guess).  But after one of his corporate mergers instigates a suicide, he finds himself with a bug problem.  The final scene haunted me for years as a kid.<br /><br />PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE - The movie is bookended by a story about an abusive and abrasive father who, disapproving of his son's reading material (the horror comic from which the stories are derived), tosses the offending literature in the trash can.  The son, needless to say, gets his revenge.  Horrifying, yes, but almost too much for this viewer.e best of the six, a mysterious crate and its grotesque contents causes havoc on a small college campus.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Don't listen to what some people have said about the picture quality of this blu-ray collection. Its very good. Those who aren't impressed are too use to color pops quality like Wall.E, and cannot appreciate tone and mood that some westerns create.     If your going to compare with the dvd set, know that they were low bitrates and cannot give true blacks and lack detail, giving a very soft look. This blu-ray version is the extact opposite. Anyone thinking about upgrading from their dvd sets, should make the adjustment as its worth it to watch in hi-def over and over and over and over...
B0000509C4|2.0|What made the first [[ASIN:0790744295 Creepshow]] good was how nicely it encapsulated the spirit of the comic book, right down to the cheesy, brightly colored panels.  The tales were short, you followed along as the wind turned the pages, and the acting was actually pretty good.<br /><br />And then they made this thing.<br /><br />King wrote the stories and Romero adapted them for the screen, but other than that and the title, this thing is about as far from the first as you can get.  Gone is the comic book feel.  Instead they've introduced a connective wrap-around cartoon that would've worked better if it'd just been live action.  Also, an annoying character called The Creep introduces and signs off on each segment.  The Creep is a pointless, campy version of The Cryptkeeper (from HBO's [[ASIN:B0009ETCOW Tales from the Crypt]]), and The Cryptkeeper was already campy enough.  Now picture him poorly animated and with a chin like an old man's, well, never mind.<br /><br />The tales here are longer (bad call) and there are fewer of them (equally bad call).  Here's the rundown:<br /><br />OLD CHIEF WOODENHEAD - Horrible exposition that is slathered on long after the audience gets it already.  A kindly store owner and his wife are beset upon by no-good-niks who trash the place, steal some valuable Native American trinkets, and then do other bad things.  Not only does this clip broadcast its ending from the first scene, but it takes its sweet time getting there, and then doesn't even show you the stuff that would normally make it creepy.<br /><br />THE RAFT - Really cool idea (about four kids who are trapped on a raft by sinister goo) is ruined by atrocious acting and some super silly writing.  Creeped me out when I watched it as a kid, but after leaving the theatre, all I could remember was the gratuitous boob shot.<br /><br />THE HITCH-HIKER - A woman hits a hitchhiker during a minor cigarette mishap and flees the scene of the crime.  \\"Can you live with this?\\" she asks herself during her interminable and unbelievable dialogue with herself.  Apparantly not.  Good effects, but -- like the first segment -- predictable and dull.<br /><br />Stupid host.  Stupid execution.  Stupid all around.  Skip this thing and rewatch the first.dialogue with herself.  Apparantly not.  Good effects, but -- like the first segment -- predictable and dull.    Stupid host.  Stupid execution.

0780021967|4.0|This is a great spy espionage film during the early Alfred Hitchcock period. This is right after he did the Man Who Knew Too Much. Robert Donat gets caught up in an assassination plot - gets chased by both the spies and the police - lots of great scenery shots, foogy/gothic moments & scenery. There is a great chase on a train going from London to Scotland, a chase on the moors, just all sorts of things going on in this non stop film. Of course the climax has to do with the mystery of the 39 Steps and catching the assassin.<br />If you are a Hitchcock fan that wants to see his pre Hollywood films, then I highly recommend this title.<br />The Criterion DVD is the one to get of course due to a superior transfer and bonus features.<br />Avoid the Art House version re release since it lacks any of the features..
B001GQACGO|5.0|Hang in with me, this is a fair review.<br /><br />Beyonce's new cd is just as creative as it is controversial. From what I have read from other reviewers \\"Beyonce fails to execute a new style that is effective\\". I believe the opposite, as well as going to publicly humiliate anyone who claims that Beyonce is trying to make \\"an alter ego\\", even if she has used those words herself.<br /><br />The disc that appears most in question is \\"Sasha Fierce\\". This disc is actually extremly interesting, aside from Ego which I constantly skip due to its strange wording that is reminiscent of awkwardly sensual themes. Beyonce just about wore the hell out of me with her B'Day cd fillers, though I would still consider it an amazing cd. \\"Greenlight\\" and \\"Kitty Kat\\" started sounded like the same song and I found myself mixing the two with \\"Freakum Dress\\" and \\"Get Me Bodied\\". Finally an artist identified their own dying trend and revitalized themself. What Beyonce has done with Sasha Fierce is introduce a variety of new sounds in order to get a general response from listeners and allow her to perform within different areas. Tracks like \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" show a more ghetto side to Beyonce which hasn't been thoroughly explored and I have more than enjoyed. \\"Radio\\" is also reminiscent of a ghetto sound as she slurs her speech in the begining and drops certain consanant sounds to create an interesting texture and feel to her voice. The beats are, according to other reviews I have read, harder for Beyonce to dance to, however, if you were to watch any of her new music videos you would quickly bite your tongue. Beyonce is not only an amazing vocalist when she needs to be, but she is able to dance better than any other performer, far exceeding the abilities of Shakira for example. I feel listeners are annoyed with the difficult rhythms to the songs, making them a challenge for one to dance to without hearing the song several times, this screaming volumes that this cd does not exhibit simplicity.<br /><br />However, one song that does show some simplicity, if not is defined by simplicity, is Diva. Yet, I am addicted to it. I found in enthralling and could not repeating it. Beyonce's use of her rhythmic voice is what rap should be like, and her husband Jay-Z should really take some lessons on changing his intunations... he is flat and sucks at rapping. Nevertheless, that is not the point. Beyonce's controversial tracks are her newest sounds, her biggest risks and I believe that this shows amazing courage and that it will pay off.<br /><br />To continue talking about \\"Sasha Fierce\\", Beyonce's works do not all need to show an amazing depth and ability in her voice. If Beyonce were to constantly try to show her vocal range in every song, listeners would quickly get bored of her voice as it would start to seem to have no dimension, for example try to listen to up tempo Leona Lewis, now listen to the same song and try to enjoy it... HARD. Beyonce's undeniable creativity in her second cd \\"Sasha Fierce\\" is not her attempting to make an alter ego, solely so she can have one. The split between Beyonce Knowled and Sasha Fierce is the drastic gap between sensual up tempo beats and heart-breaking ballads, and the two are not comparable. To create a single cd with tracks such as those featured on both cds would make Beyonce seem almost hypocritical, for this Beyonce separates the two to show that she too is dimensional. However, due to shoddy information and weak focuses by the media this cd is not getting the wrap it deserves. Beyonce's actions are not pulling at straws in order to get a response, Beyonce has made the expert decision to separate sensuality to another name so that \\"the common man\\" wouldn't be as likely to condemn her meaningful ballads, claiming that a girl who sings about being taped naked on a video phone (Video Phone) wouldn't realistically be singing about her struggling relationship where she realizes she was never there for her boyfriendand is no losing him (Disappear).<br /><br />However, ironically the media instantly focuses on the split as a negative thing. I remember that before I was familiar with the cd I was turned off to the idea that Beyonce was changing her name to Sasha Fierce. In truth, that was no where near happening. Beyonce is not always going to produce the same up tempo music and she has provided more than enough of similar sounding tracks for fans of her \\"old stuff\\" on B'Day, thank God she redeemed herself with \\"Beautiful Liar\\". Like how rock fans sometimes only prefer \\"the old stuff\\" of a band, this is the point where Beyonce's maturity in her career extends her into a new world of music. Though I have read reviews that claimed songs like \\"Ego\\", \\"Video Phone\\", and \\"Diva\\" display her shallower qualities and show a lack of maturity, I beg that one might reconsider this and realize what I have mentioned above. Beyonce's maturity brought her to realize that some fans enjoy uptempo, sensual tracks. Why were/are the Pussycat dolls such a radio sensation? Separating her meaningful ballads from her sensual, upbeat music, Beyonce has created herself \\"an alter ego\\" but really only made the real Beyonce the focal point of attraction while allowing those who will enjoy her uptempo music to indulge in \\"Sasha Fierce\\".<br /><br />Personally, I am a true Beyonce fan and have liked and supported her since she hit the stage and I believe part of being a real fan is really examining her choices before making shallow claims as to her career moves and to her maturity. Regardless of how articulate you appear, your logic is flawed in that you fail to recognize Beyonce's reasons for creating the heavily judged \\"alter ego\\".and is no losing him (Disappear).<br /><br />However, ironically the media instantly focuses on the split as a negative thing.

B000005HCM|5.0|An unexpected hit for the late trumpeter, Lee Morgan, \\"The Sidewinder\\" also brought him great popularity.  Also it's the first time I heard the great Joe Henderson on disc also and a great solo it is ranking second to his \\"Song for My Father\\" side as well. I heard that pianist Barry Harris was the one who suggested the rhythms to Lee so I think credit should be shared with him as well for the success of this track as well.  The other tunes are of course basically hard-bop with the standouts being \\"Totem Pole\\" and \\"Hocus-Pocus\\". The late recently departed Freddie Hubbard once noted while playing with Lee that the crowd automatically responded to him more than Hubbard's technical displays of prowess.  I have to admit after having listened to both trumpeters in person that even though Hubbard had more technique than Lee, that Morgan's tone was warmer and very bluesy which made audiences.  For a demonstration of the differences in techniques, check out \\"The Night of the Cookers\\".  Anyway if you want to start a Lee Morgan collection, you can't go wrong with this or \\"Search for the New Land\\".
075640407X|5.0|I lucked upon this book while searching for something new to read.  It's easily  one of the best books I've read in  years.  It was tough to get into at first, but I got drawn into the story and found myself unable to put it down until finished.<br /><br />I rarely recommend books because personal tastes vary widely, and have never felt strongly enough about a book to write a review, but there's a first time for everything!  My only regret is that I'm done with the book and the next in the series doesn't come out for another couple of months.<br /><br />The cover says it's a cross between Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series.  Don't let that mislead you.  It is not the ponderous and too-complicated LotR trilogy, nor the fanciful Harry Potter.  It's a good solid read, deep enough to bring the setting to life in your mind, make you think about the characters and miss it all when the story's done, but not so difficult that you have to take notes!
B001JNNE64|5.0|Looks like I should have waited since now this Blu-ray edition of this Oscar winner is now $14.99 instead of $26.99 which I paid about a week and half ago!!  That's even cheaper than what Best buy advertised.  Anyway I found this edition to boast better chroma and sound than the version HD Net broadcasted.  A plus definitely is the CD of Mozart selections by Neville Mariner.  As for Digital Copy, I didn't find the image on computer to be much worse than it would be on Standard Def.  Anyway if you love this film like I do and am a music lover--I do recommend this film along with the Godfather trilogy in Blu-Ray as well.
B00003CY0V|5.0|There has been many people that add the fact that there are parts that are completely unnecessarily (scene with Hally Barry anyone?) and some that are very cliche.<br /><br />Personally, I believe this to be true. But that adds to the charm of this movie. It's always changing, and never the same. Without spoiling any of the plot (to do that would be a waste of a great movie) some parts could of been done better, with a bit more editting, but overall, I would recommend this to anyone that is open minded and wants a good deep movie and not just another action movie.
0920668372|5.0|I've been reading this book to my son at bedtime for 3 years (he's 4 now). I've known about it for many years before I became a mother and I get choked up every time I read it to this day. My son actually chooses this one often. He identifies with the boy in the story, and is starting to understand that he's growing like the boy and will eventually become a man with his own family to love and care for. He wants his own son.:) Very sweet and endearing book.     And for those who've labeled the book creepy, and I know which part they're referring to, sadly those folks have missed the most important point of the story: it's a figurative illustration of a literal love that will last no matter how old your son is. I'm certain the author did not mean for the \\"drive across town\\" part to be taken literally - give me a break!
0385484518|1.0|Always read the full book before you criticize! So, I suffered through this book even though, mercifully, it is a short one. Our lives are so empty, so bereft of meaning - that we will make a bestseller of even the most inane, most mediocre self-help book. Life is not as simple as Morrie makes it out to be. If someone really cares, he would not cocoon himself with all material comforts and spend a fortune on medical expenses - when children are starving to death around the world. Morrie seems as selfish as anyone else - he wants what he wants and wraps his wants with Hallmark philosophy. Meanwhile the Earth is getting destroyed through global warming, millions are dying unnecessarily everywhere and economies and countries are going bust making billions jobless...if you want true spirituality, go to the source - read the Bible, the Koran, the Gita....  Better still, go help someone who desperately needs help    Srinivas Anumolu
B000002UAU|5.0|While it should come as no surprise that the greatest achievement of the greatest band of the rock era should be situated at the No. 1 spot on Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, it should also be obvious that this album's mythic status in Western culture could place it nowhere else. I'm not saying that debate about its artistic merits should not take place. Indeed, I cannot think of another work in the entire popular canon that has endured so much revisionist scrutiny than Sgt. Pepper. It's hard to find a critic who thinks it's the best Beatles album, let alone the best album.   Yet when the votes were all tallied, here it rested again, at the top of the heap. The sheer impact that Sgt. Pepper created upon its arrival at the beginning of the \\"Summer of Love\\" was so dramatically, jaw-droppingly revelatory and powerful, that its reverberations are still being felt forcibly more than forty years later. As I sit here writing in February 2009, I notice that the album sits at No. 72 in overall sales during this hour at Amazon.com. That is not simply extraordinary, it is so absolutely, mind-bogglingly strange that it demands some sort of revolutionary macro-theory on the much larger perspective of cultural analysis.     But listening makes a strong argument. If it is indeed true that no one had made an album like Sgt. Pepper before, it is more than equally true that no one makes them like this anymore. Despite the flurry of creative artistry and risk taking that occurred in the music industry in the years immediately following the album's debut - and which has periodically returned in varying degrees in cycles in the decades since - there is something absolutely unique and definitive about this particular recording that still resonates at an iconic pitch that probably transcends the music itself.     For those of us old enough to remember, the world changed the day Sgt. Pepper was released. How can we explain or justify such a statement? Of course, we can always fall back on the banal observation that \\"If you weren't there, there's no way to understand it.\\" But since succeeding generations keep discovering the album as a truly unique and personally life-changing experience, this speaks on a very deep level to the notion that it may even be more vital now than when it first appeared. If this is so, then the Beatles' masterpiece of self transformation quite possibly operates on a level of \\"timelessness\\" or \\"universality\\" that goes to a much deeper yearning for meaning - a kind of spiritual tonic. Its greatness may even exceed what was claimed for it in its day - which is saying quite a lot indeed.     For those of us who have lived with this music for so long, it's very difficult to gain any sort of objectivity. I can only suggest the near-impossible experiment of listening to Sgt. Pepper again as if it were a new album. Or imagine yourself hearing it for the first time back in 1967. Clear your head of preconceptions and distractions (fix those holes!), just put the thing on and listen to it. Try to make the experience fresh for yourself. While this may not be able to be perfectly accomplished, I predict that you will hear things that will absolutely astonish you. New listeners need not worry about this, as their continual new discovery demonstrates daily. But to re-discover the apparently infinite power of self-creation that this classic collision of energy, ideas and social momentum brought forth is to invite the re-discovery and re-creation of yourself.     Oh yes . . . and a splendid time is guaranteed for all.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|The opener has a voice like Howling Wolf/Captain Beefheart/Tom Waits over a 3/4 to 4/4 beat and Super Classic Rock arrangement.  God, an album fulla these and he'd make Mudcrutch and the Raconteurs look sorry.<br />This song is retro and yet current.  Kudo's Sir Paul.<br /><br />Then a White Album acoustic song follows.  OK, you still got it.  Check.<br /><br />Then there are U2 and Peter Gabriel-like elements to some of the rest of the songs.  The album comes steadily down to a relaxed musical cadence, but never becomes boring or overly melodic.  There is always enough variety in the mix, enough changes to keep every song interesting.<br /><br />13 songs in 13 days?  Playing every instrument?  Paul McCartney has proven he has nothing to prove anymore.<br /><br />We believe you Paul.  YOU were the experimental Beatle.  The one who understood Arrangements.  The musician's musician capable of outplaying your fellow band-mates.  The songwriter that needs an external nudge to realize your inner greatness.<br /><br />And while John tamed your sweetnes sometimes and pushed you to go beyond yourself and become a second Little Richard, so \\"Youth\\" your producer on this has tamed and pushed you into being great once again.<br /><br />The lyrics are poetry, in a very upbeat message of love and peacefulness.  But the music isn't sappy.  The music goes from Rock and Folk to Pop and World.<br /><br />He makes his Hofner Bass Guitar sound almost as good as his Rickenbacker.  He plays the Piano unlike he's played it in the past.  His lead choices are apropo.  He doesn't overdo the Mandolin nor the Mellotron.  Instruments are tasteful, yet not \\"careful\\".  They push the songs.<br /><br />Keep your \\"Memories Almost Full\\" in hiding, and brandish this \\"Electric Arguments\\", happy that Paul has created his best album in 30 years.<br /><br />If I had to rate this album, it's right up there with \\"RAM\\".  I'd go so far as to say \\"Electric Arguments\\" surpasses \\"RAM\\".
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I watched this orginally on the internet. When I found out it had come out on DVD, I had to buy it. It is now my new standby! It comes with the singing comentary, and video applications to the Evil League of Evil. It was worth every dollar, and I can't wait for the next horrible one! ;)
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Little Mermaid was one of my children's favorite movies when they were younger.  It was great to see this upgraded version and enjoy the timeless music and story again.  We all enjoyed it!
B001EOQWEO|2.0|Loved the film!  As usual, Pixar does quality work!<br /><br />However, like others, I had problems with the disk.  The film stalls and skips in my player (which plays other disks just fine).  Disney has done the film (and its fans) a major disservice by slipping the DVDs in a scratch-prone paper-board case.  Would it have really been such a huge setback for them to package the disks in a better, more sturdy case?  Shame on you for being such tightwads with the packaging!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|We're big fans of Joss Whedon's work.  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is another wonderful example of his writing abilities.  We watched it first online and had to buy it.  Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion are WONDERFUL in this show, and Felicia Day is truly loveable.  The script and story are typical of Joss.  It's funny, sad, thought-provoking, refreshing, disturbing, and a display of many facets of being human, all in one package.  The lyrics to the songs are absolutely ingenious.  My only hesitation in giving this 5 stars is the quality of the music itsself.  On the plus side, the melodies, harmonies, etc. are very good, catchy, and fun to listen to.  The countermelodies are wonderful.  On the down side, the chord progressions were for the most part very predictable and simple.  It started to have a packaged feel.  I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, because that's the only thing that kept Dr. Horrible from being absolutely perfect to someone who is VERY picky about music.  Overall, we loved it and have watched it several times since we got it.  My husband and I even walk around singing and humming the tunes.  If you like Joss Whedon, this is a must-see, must-have.
0743455967|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the history of Stephen King's upbringing.  I am not a writer, so \\"the writing\\" version of this book did not help me, but it did open my eyes to how writers should write better.<br /><br />I love to read, so having this book will be quite helpful to me when reviewing novels.<br /><br />The first part of this book depicts Stephen Kings life and how he became what he is today.  I found it very interesting to learn how he started out as a great writer and to learn the methods he uses while writing.<br /><br />If you are a writer, I strongly recommend that you buy this book.  It should help many aspiring writers and who better to learn from than:  \\"The Master.\\"<br /><br />This book will help any writer, in any genre.  It isn't for horror writers only, but all writers.  Stephen pushes all writers to go for it, to do their best, and he is there to help you along the way.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I love the cd and it arrived ahead of schedule.    Great job!
0930289234|3.0|I was first totally pumped to read this graphic novel because of the upcoming film of Watchmen. In the first chapter, I still thought it was great and it would pick up later, but I was wrong. The plot seems to drone on and on and on and on....well you get my point. I mean, who wants to see Dr. Manhattan having sex with his clones? Anyways, the movie looks way better than what this book is really about, yet something about the Watchmen makes it epic enough to bare....
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight films are awesome. I think they might be the best Batman movies. I'm glad I could get this on Blu-Ray. Worth it if you have the Blu-ray player. Cool bike, Batman!
0553381687|5.0|I was first a bit intimidated when I picked up A Game of Thrones, with the 800 and something pages it has. I thought that this was awfully long for a fantasy book but when I started reading it, I could not put it down. George R.R. Martin does a brilliant job in making the plot line flow like liquid but at the same time, giving every character their deserved description.<br /><br />This, along with the Riftwar Saga by Raymond E. Feist are some of my favorite works of fiction. I would HIGHLY recommend giving this enticing and thrilling game of thrones.
B00168OINK|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. It's up there with Toy Story and Monsters Inc,Madagascar. Kid movies that you can't get tired of. This is the new \\"Disney\\".
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliott lives in a sad and depressive coal mining town in Northern England. There are few local pleasures to be had, police in riot gear are on their ever-present guard throughout the streets, and the whole thing in general is a confluence of rusted metal doors and brick tenements that look like they are built haphazardly on top of each other. Billy, like the rest of the young men in the village, goes to daily boxing practice in order to keep up repressive prototypes of machismo that all the men in the town must ascribe to. Unfortunately he is not very good at it, but is does have natural and immediately evident talent in the ballet classes which get taught in the same gym as soon as boxing practice ends. Soon Billy finds his true calling in the art, all the while keeping it a secret from his drunk and depressive father and brother, themselves caught in their own strife with the ongoing Miners Strike that plagued their part of the country at that time.     Billy Elliot is a film about staying true to yourself and ignoring adversity. It is about finding what's right for you and following it with everything you've got. It is about using your God-given talent to improve yourelf and get yourself out of your current sad reality. It is about not judging others, about kindness. As a film it works beautifully. The screenplay is witty, the characters are true, the storyline fantastical but not at all improbable. Films like this are so simple and sweet and rare that to criticize them is to take away from the intentions of the piece. Some things should be simply celebrated for elevating man's present condition and for being so intentionally open and, in large part, free. This is an ultimate feel-good film.
0896762629|5.0|I waited many years for this book and it was utterly worth the wait. You will learn things about ruffs and linen that, as a re-enactor you may have guessed to be true, but are now proved to be true. The variety and depth of item covered is amazing. You will learn how to prop, prepare and starch a ruff, how the seams on shirts were done in several different areas, the proportions in existing linen, types of lace... it's all invaluable and I'm truly sad Ms. Arnold is no longer with us to continue with her ground breaking work.
0316017922|3.0|I thought the start of the book was pretty neat...hockey players getting an advantage because of their birthdays, entrepreneurs who benefited tremendously from external circumstance, etc was a good story.  And he applies it to a larger social message that since increased opportunities are what help cause these positive outliers we should focus on providing as many opportunities as possible.  He kind of lost me in the second half of the book though.  I'm not from the South but some of that was borderline offensive.  And while the stats may show Asian students are better at math, I'm not convinced that patience with rice paddies is really the reason.  On a side note Gladwell seems like a decent guy and I hate people avoiding controversial topics because they're afraid of being perceived as insensitive.  But boy, some of the second half of the book sure seems like it's heading down a slippery slope when it comes to applying general rules to ethnic groups.  Finally, I'd be curious to read one of his books with a normal book size and missing a lot of the charts he throws in (like 3 pages of when the richest people in history were born).  I know I'm probably nitpicking but does he get paid by the page?  Those 320 pages had like 50 solid pages of material.  I think Gladwell is a good journalist who can write a great 20 page magazine article but none of his 3 books have blown me away from cover to cover.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|This CD is the soundtrack to \\"Once,\\" an amazing and surprising Irish film.  The music on this CD will warm your soul.  It is refreshingly acoustic and harmonious.  Recommended to all who love from-the-heart music!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought this product in August 2006 and till Feb 2009, it worked perfectly. I get a headache if the headphones are heavy. The best design I have seen. Great price too.
B001DEVZUG|5.0|Having now had a chance to watch all the videos and listen to the CD, I just can't say enough how much I love all this music. Any Annie Lennox fan will find many of their favorites here, and for newbies, it's a great introduction to the Diva of White Soul.    I really love \\"Pattern of My Life.\\"  With \\"Shining Light,\\" it's one of the new songs here, and it alone is worth the price of admission. I wasn't familiar with it before (it's a cover of a Keane song), but it's one of those that just connects on first listen. \\"Shining Light\\" is a little too joyous for my tastes, as Ms. Lennox's voice is best showcased when expressing angst and pain.  (There's a reason they call it \\"blue-eyed soul,\\" and nobody does it better.)    Other than weak authoring on the DVD (specifically, there's no ALL PLAY function), I don't get what the complaints are about. Most of these videos were made 10-15 years ago for TV, so the image quality is exactly what you'd expect.  The \\"Pavement Cracks\\" video has a raw disconnect with its non-synching and rough cuts. Frankly, I think a previous reviewer misunderstood this video-  it's SUPPOSED to be like that.  And it's great to see many of her classic videos again on a big screen. Like her music, they always hold up and entertain.  It is regretful that the two new videos are not included on the US version of the DVD, but that's more likely Sony's calculation than that of the producers or artist herself.    The Collection is beautifully packaged, with a lovely photo & lyrics insert, and a touching dedication. All around, this is a great bookend for Ms. Lennox's solo career with Sony. I expect the UK/Eur version to be even better with its extra audio tracks and two extra videos.  It's always a shame that record companies contrive these regional versions, as someone always ends up feeling short-changed.  But that's just the music business.  Annie Lennox has made some phenomenal music since her Eurythmics days, and this Collection, whichever version you get, really showcases the best of it.
0525951113|2.0|I picked up Daemon because I'd read a bunch of glowing reviews and this sort of Michael Crichtonesque technothriller is just up my street.    The book's premise is great - a dying computer mogul unleashes a self-perpetuating computer programme that is capable of manipulating global events long after its creator's death - and I know enough about computers to know that much of what Suarez posits is reasonably plausible.    Unfortunately, while the plot is fascinating, the characters are beyond dull. Because the plot is so sprawling, the already sketchily presented characters are all reduced to bit players in the story and are so two-dimensional (the tough cop caught in loveless marriage, the no-nonsense but still sexy government agent, the battle-scarred special ops commando, the computer genius of indeterminate origin, the troubled but smart ex-con, the psychotic computer hacker etc) that it's hard to care whether any of them live or die.    And the ending...     Actually, what ending? Having led the reader on through the book to find out exactly what the crazed computer mogul was planning when he unleashed the demon, the author simply sidesteps the issue with a plot twist that you can see coming for miles, a lot of woolly philosophising and the suggestion that you'll have to wait till the sequel to find out what the hell is going on. You are left - almost literally - dangling on a thread that goes nowhere.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|Almost every song on this CD is really good.  I'm glad that it is in my library.
0385340990|3.0|I expected a little more than I got with this book~it seemed to have so many possibilities from the description of the period and the place. I felt it could have been much more suspenseful and contained many more stories by the residents of the island about their experiences with the Germans occupying their island.  It was too short and too shallow.
B001J4E1D8|4.0|I watched this on PBS, but wanted it for my wife.  She enjoyed it greatly.
0439023483|4.0|I don't remember where I read a recommendation for this book, and when I picked it up from my library's hold shelf, I was amazed.  A Young Adult fantasy?  Why did I order this?  What a pleasant surprise!  The story is witty, fast moving, with likable characters, suspense, and unexpected plot turns at every point.  I've read many action/suspense books and thought I had it all mapped out, but was wrong, or at least mostly.  My only complaint is the fairly standard teenage-girl narrative voice, which is inappropriate for the setting and plot, and the promise of a sequel.  That seems obligatory, aimed at the kind of reader who expects all problems to have a solution.  They don't;  I would have preferred the story to stop here.      Still, a very entertaining, even moving and thought-provoking book.
B00005MP58|5.0|My wife wished that she could have this version with Colin Firth someday, so it became a very good birthday present.  Just what she wanted.
B000HEWEEE|4.0|This movie doesn't always make sense.  There are a lot of holes in the plot and things that just don't seem to add up.  That said, it's an enjoyable escape.  It's not sugary sweet, it's just a nice relaxing movie that makes you feel good.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Love the Bee Gees no matter the song and the packaging of Odessa is great. Getting it from Amazon was easy and quick. Got here in record time.
0140284087|5.0|Did I read that correctly? The material is frothy and the characters haven't aged well?  Perhaps lazza has missed the point of reading a Bertie and Jeeves.    The characters of Betram Wooster and Jeeves are, indeed, far removed from today's society -- but that's what makes them so priceless.  We are taken on romp after romp through busy London in the roaring 20s and the sleepy English countryside.  And in the day-to-day lives of these two characters, Wodehouse has preserved for us the life of domestic service and the frivolities of the upper class in the 20s.      Their lack of grit and raunchiness may be too tame for some, but P.G.'s Bertie and Jeeves deliver page after delightful page of sheer silliness, as Wodehouse strings us through meandering and beautifully crafted lines.    So, comparing Bertie and Jeeves to 2009?  Seems a little like comparing a stroll in the park to an hour online and asking, \\"Which one's better?\\"  P.G. Wodehouse was one of THE great writers of prose.  So relax, read, and enjoy, because with Wodehouse, getting there is half the fun.
0810970686|5.0|My four boys, LOVE this series.  Fast delivery, great brand new condition.  Thank you!
B0018OAOQC|2.0|I bought this album based on the song Mr. and Mrs. Ness, which rocks pretty hard.  Every song on the album, with the exception of the above and one other, is retarded.  It almost sounds like a joke.  The guys voice is a mix between Danzig, Elvis, and Cher.  No good
0743455967|5.0|First published in 2000, I wasn't sure if Stephen King's On Writing would still be a helpful handbook for a newbie author, almost ten years later.<br />Shortly after I began reading the first part which explains King's personal side in a vividly written autobiography, I didn't care about the answer anymore; I found myself hugely entertained. The pure honesty in which King describes his ups and downs (often more downs), gave me insight of his battle with addiction - alcohol, cocaine and the utter need to write. Maybe it isn't fair to call King's profession an addiction, after all; that's what the man does best. But as someone who shares a similar 'addiction',  I'm just going to have to say that he would probably agree.<br /><br />If you are looking to read a \\"how-to\\" book on writing, the second half of the book might surprise, disappoint or thoroughly enlighten you. There aren't any devoted chapters which tell you how to properly plot your story, form and mold your characters, or make your dialogs believable. Instead, the unconventional way King brings his points across is very refreshing. I've thumbed through many other books in this genre; but just like King says in the opening line of his second foreword, \\"...most books on writing are filled with bull(peep).\\" I must say - I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />No matter if you are a non-writing King-reader or if you are a writing King non-reader, On Writing will entertain, teach, and open your eyes to the complex world of (creating) fiction. 'Creating' fiction,  because it is not just writing in proper grammar that makes a book good. It is the determination, the love, feel and creativity the author pours into his/her piece. And King most certainly brought all these points - and more - very well together.<br /><br />Rebecca Lerwill, author of [[ASIN:1933538872 Relocating Mia]]

0810970686|5.0|My 10 year old son LOVED this book! I have never seen him so excited to read!He finished it in 2 days and he is now sharing it with his classmates. I had reserved it at our local library, but there were 256 people waiting for it, so I decided to buy it instead.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|This series is told from the point of view of the rival centurions, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, featured in Ceasar's Gallic Wars.  It neatly circumvents the obvious and often-told aspects of the history of this period, and artfully creates a story assuming that the viewer already knows the famous events.  Given that no one can possibly best Shakespeare's version of Marc Antony's oration to the people on the subject of Caesar's death, this series cleverly has a plebian giving his critique of Brutus vs. Antony's speech in a very common accent, in a tavern with a bunch of brawling ex-soldiers over beer.  And the image of Marc Antony being strigilled while upbraiding Vorenus and attended by a midget dressed and named Cato is hysterically funny beyond belief.      I have rarely seen a historical drama shot with the pace, wit, and insight  of this series.
0743496736|5.0|This book was disturbing but very well done. A 17 year old who had been teased and tormented all his life shoots and kills 10 of his fellow students. Was he guilty of cold blooded murder or had he been pushed to the point of no return? A great read for Picoult fans or anyone.
0345495004|1.0|In other books I've read, no matter the subject, there is always someone I admire. This book is about self centered people, who have the opinion that they can do as they wish, with others, including children, cast by the wayside. I don't know how close this is to the true story, but not worth reading.  My copy will go into the garbage where it belongs.
B001BVRNPW|4.0|We're were a big fan of the Stargate SG-1 series on TV and have enjoyed the Stargate movie \\"Continuum\\". The \\"Ark of Truth\\" also did not disappoint.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|This is movie is a turkey. Actors who cannot sing well, a director who must have been inspired by MTV videos, a poorly conceived production, all come together to nearly ruin a fine play and great music. Brosnan bombed as a singer. One of the funnest dances from the play  (with swim fins) was cut to a few seconds.  Sometimes the photography was so close it cut off arms and other parts of the actors who were dancing or otherwise needed to be seen. Mobs of extras suddenly appear to dilute dances or songs or just pad the action.
B000026258|3.0|As a fan of contemporary classical music I had this piece recommended to me by several friends, but I feel pretty ambivalent whenever I listen to it.  This may have been ground-breaking when it was first composed, but to me it sounds like so much trance music.  It's not something that I could listen to just for the sake of listening to it, because there isn't enough material for me to find it interesting; but because of that, and because its sounds are soothing, it makes for solid background music while I'm at work.
B000CCU7N6|5.0|It's Summer's disco music that has best withstood the passing time in my opinion. The dance anthem I Feel Love and the soaring fast-paced MacArthur Park are representative of her versatility in the middle to late 1970s, whilst rock guitar infuse Hot Stuff and Bad Girls with an urgency & gravitas that disempowered the foes of disco. The 1979 album [[ASIN:B00009U5J5 Bad Girls]] was a triumph with its electro-pop tracks Our Love, Lucky & Sunset People plus moving ballads like On My Honor & There Will Always Be A You.<br /><br />The greatest hits on The Journey include the plaintive ballad On The Radio, the up-tempo albeit tuneless duet with Streisand as well as a variety of pop songs in different styles. She Works Hard For The Money is a mid-80s stomper; the then-famous producers Stock, Aitken, Waterman gave Donna a well-deserved hit with the breezy This Time I Know It's For Real at the end of that decade. The most interesting are the two [[ASIN:B000002GC4 Quincy Jones]] produced tracks Love Is In Control & even more so, [[ASIN:B000001E6D State of Independence]] with its complex yet appealing arrangement & sublime vocals.<br /><br />The bonus disc contains more magic, particularly the original long version of Love to Love You Baby and two striking mixes of I Feel Love & Hot Stuff. This compilation is just a sampler of Donna Summer's huge contribution to popular music since the 1970s, but still a good showcase of some of her most memorable moments. There's a variety of Best Of & Greatest Hits collections; fans that prefer her disco phase might be more interested in [[ASIN:B000TM0HM0 The Dance Collection]] that contains the entire MacArthur Park Suite.
B00007K02F|2.0|Although the movie was well done, because the movie was under 1 1/2 hours, it did not do the book justice at all.  There wasn't enough time for character development between Jane and Mr. Rochester so when they said they loved each other, it just didn't seem believable.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|When it comes to Ridley Scott, I'm willing to check out anything the iconic director churns out. From Alien to Blade Runner to Gladiator to American Gangster, Scott's dynamic visual flair has always been something that has seperated him from other directors of his ilk. Body of Lies is no different, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Roger Ferris, a CIA specialist attempting to infiltrate a major terrorist leader in the Middle East. His boss is Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), whose double dealings and side operations threaten to blow Ferris' cover as he descends deeper and deeper into the Islamic underworld, in particular his dealings with Hani (Mark Strong) which could make or break the situation at hand. Always compelling, Body of Lies works thanks to The Departed scribe William Monahan's crackling screenplay and DiCaprio's electric performance. Crowe and Strong are great as well, but the film's only real flaw is that it doesn't always feel as if Scott's heart is in it all the way. While Body of Lies does bear his distinction of visual mastery, there's just too many moments of being dragged along by the occasional muddled story and plot. That aside, Body of Lies is an intelligent and entertaining espionage thriller that delivers the goods, and is definitely worth seeing as well.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is a great BBC interpretation of Jane Eyre.  The cinematography leaves much to be desired; however, when Timothy Dalton enters in Episode Three, he lights up the screen.  He believes this is his best work, and I have to agree with him.  He does an excellent job portraying Mr.  Rochester; he's just too handsome compared to the description in the book.  This is a big time investment, but I believe it is worth it if one is in the mood for a good 19th century romantic literature adaptation.

B000GPIPD8|5.0|I recently began to listen to the Black Keys.  From the first note, they had me hooked.  I'd been itching to buy their CD and am I glad that I did.  Not a let-down.  Even more, this CD is easily in my top 10.  Every song rocks with its blues influence.  Also, recently saw them live - and they are just as good live.  I will certainly buy the other CDs.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Whether you look at it as one long movie or 10 short movies, the series never disappoints.  Great acting throughout comes from a variety of characters.  Good mix of action, drama, and realism with the veterans interviews.  Strongly recommend!
1564029654|5.0|This is a nice story.  The illustrations are wonderful.  My 16 month old son requests on a regular basis.  Although he has no understanding of the plot, he loves to point to each \\"owl baby\\" on the page.  We choose between this, Goodnight Moon, The Big Red Barn, and The Going to Bed Book every night.
0307394549|4.0|This book has tons of cookies. You'll find one for any occasion. Some of the ingredients are a bit expensive, but you can just substitute, for instance, just use a different kind of nuts. I also find some of recipes have extra steps in them, taking up time. Some of them you can skip, but some are important for the outcome of the recipe. It's a great book, and has some good photos of the finished cookies. In the front of the book is the recipe list, and a photo of the finished cookie. This is quite helpful.
068485743X|5.0|Every writer should read The First Five Pages by Noah Lukeman. You start learning lessons in the Introduction and it only gets better from there.<br /><br />The heavy hitters are the chapters on Dialogue, Sound, Style, and Tone. Wish I had read this book long ago. Even those who have been writing for a long while can benefit from this book. It is filled with surprises.<br /><br />Overall I give the book five stars.
B001JNNE64|2.0|Debates about the original theatrical release vs. the Director's Cut can be found in other reviews. I enjoy both versions of the film.    My major complaint with this release is the quality of the video. Warner has used DNR (digital noise reduction) to \\"clean up\\" the film. The film grain is no longer visible - even when the video is projected onto a large screen - and fine detail has been lost or smeared.    This really breaks my heart, as this is one of my favorite films. I can only hope there is eventually a better video mastering committed to disc.
159448385X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and am still feeling sad! The characters in the book are so well developed and it's easy to empathize with them. I haven't yet read The Kite Runner, but that's next on my list. This book was easy to get into right from the start. I loved it!
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I was not shipped the right item twice, I am still waiting for you to credit my credit card with this purchase which I sent back.  I was sent the wrong one twice...I wanted Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, not blue ray...I wanted it in 3d, the person on telephone wasn't even listening to me when I re-orderd it again, and had to spend my time to send it back again, which I am still waiting for you to credit my credit card.....So I was not happy with my purchase.
1401307450|1.0|This book is a total waste of time.  Anthony Kiedis is narcissistic and doesn't have anything to say.  I like the music from the Chili Peppers and I particularly like reading biographies from wayward celebreties, but always in the hope that perhaps they've learned that chasing money, fame and good times is as empty as it seems.  Anthony is clearly stuck on himself and is still very much an addict.  Sadly, I'm afraid his life story will end with a headline, \\"Chili Peppers Lead Singer, Anthony Kiedis Died Alone of a Drug Overdose\\"<br /><br />The book contains boasting about each one of his exploits and all I can think is, \\"What a pathetic fool!\\"  The quote, \\"It is better to be quiet and be thought a fool, than open my mouth and remove all doubt,\\" would describe Anthony and this book well.<br /><br />It is evident that Anthony has scar tissue, but his scars are deep within his soul.  The book is drivel, and even if you're drawn to the book like watching a train wreck, you'll be disappointed that the book delivers nothing of subtance.<br /><br />I do hope that, by some miracle, Anthony finds true redemption and his life is transformed into one that has purpose and meaning and that his legacy will be different than what's written in this book.
B001I0Z43Y|5.0|I purchased this handy, dandy little device for my Playstation Portable (PSP).  I find that MicroSDHC cards are cheaper and more plentiful, and generally have a higher storage capacity than the Memory Stick Pro Duos.  This adapter, the PhotoFast MicroSDHC to MS Pro Duo Adapter, combines the storage capacities of two MicroSD and/or MicroSDHC cards into one large MemoryStick Pro Duo.  The largest MemoryStick Pro Duo available on Amazon is a 16gb variety, going for (at the time of this review) $90, $65 from other vendors.  The largest MicroSDHC card available on Amazon is also 16gb, going for around $50, as low as $45 from other vendors.    This little device sells for as cheap as $15 (including shipping) and can support TWO microSDHC cards of up to 16gb capacity... that's a potential maximum of 32gb of space for about $120, versus $90 for half the memory.  And I can only assume that they say it supports up to 16gb on each card because that's the maximum amount of memory available at this time!    Sadly I have not been able to test the capabilities of putting 32gb worth of memory in this device, but I know it functions perfectly well with one 8gb MicroSDHC and one 1gb MicroSDHC, either combined OR by themselves.    I highly recommend this product.      If you found this review useful, please mark it as such.  Thanks!
0743270754|2.0|While good on the Emancipation Proclamation and the Gettysburg Address, this book is not in the league of McCullough, Caro, or Chenow works.  Too much she is trying to control.  Do we need to know how much Kate Chase, a trivial historical figure at best, spends on interior decorating?        If the author took a character like Kate Chase and inserted her in an isolated subchapter, it might have been nice.  But she pops up all over the book.  One way the author kills narrative drive.

B000ANVPPQ|4.0|It does not get any better than John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara! When the 2 of them are on the screen together, it feels that they are truly married.

Don't forget ALL of the same actors that you see in The Duke's movies! As I have said many times before, \\"Who today could play a John Wayne part?

1400082773|5.0|As we pass from childhood to adulthood we all have to find out who we are. For many of us that might seem less of a challenge if we are born into a family and a community that might be deemed average but, as we know, it is never easy no matter how prosaic and determinable our roots.<br /><br />Dreams From My Father tells the story of how our 44th President, born of a brilliant, mercurial and mythic black father, whom he almost never knew directly, and a white \\"flower child\\" mother, raised in large part by his  white middle American lapsed Protestant grandparents in Honolulu and later with his mother and her Indonesian second husband in Jakarta, made the journey of self discovery and became the man we see today as the leader of the Free World. We see how the influences of disparate cultures, the awakening to the reality that he was black in a white society, the constant probing and analysis of his roots and environments led to the formation of this extraordinary man. We see how carefully he weighed all of the varied elements and choices at each step of his life which led, almost inevitably, to a path of public service that will affect all of our lives in the days to come.<br /><br />A must read for a full understanding of the man who will lead us in this time of overwhelming challenges.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|This movie had sounded really good when I heard about it, and I think I got my expectations up a little too high.  I was a bit disappointed when I actually watched it.  The plot could have been better, and the ending was just strange.  There is an attempted twist at the end, but it's not done well.  It's not something I would bother to watch again.  I'm a big Donnie Wahlberg fan, and have to say he was pretty much the only decent part of the movie.  ;)
0739321005|5.0|Since this book was written before Obama began his political career, and it doesn't mention politics, I'm going to try and judge it free from my political biases and knowledge of what happened after the book was published.    I usually don't read biographies, but a friend of mine convinced me to try this one and lent me the audiobook. I'm glad I did. My first impression was that Obama wrote as well, if not better, than any author I've ever read before. He has the ability to paint a picture with words that is unmatched outside of the purely literary field. Hearing the whole book read in his deep sonorous voice makes it even better. (He even does a very good Kenyan accent when called for).    Obama's story is not a simple one. It's not about growing up without a father, or being the only black in a white neighborhood. It's not about racism, black identity, urban issues, or a man's search for his roots. Yet somehow, it is all of those. It's a view into a life that I couldn't have even imagined previously, and would never have seen. Through Obama's eyes we're taken to the poor parts of Indonesia, the rough streets of the south side of Chicago, the black community in an American college, and finally, a family reunion in Kenya. By the time the book was done, I nearly had tears in my eyes.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|An outstanding photograhy presentation in fact the photography is so spectacular I would rate it 20 ON A ONE TO TEN RATING WITH TEN BEING EXCELLENT.....Having said this I need to say the sound mixing was so poor  that a person with hearing difficulty is unable to make out the narrators speech because the background music is soo loud it drowns out the narrating...what an absolute shame for such an otherwise wonderful production

044024238X|5.0|Excerpted from my original review blog post ([...])    As any Kinsella book I was not disappointed at all with The Undomestic Goddess. The theme of the book is trying to decide what really matters in life. Samantha was so driven to reach her goal of becoming partner in her law firm that she sacrificed a lot of her personal life in order to do so. With unexpected events she finds herself in a completely new setting and is left to ponder what she really wants. It was a fun read, just as all of Kinsella's other books.
0810993139|1.0|After noticing my 9-year-old acquiring a \\"new-found\\" attitude towards us and his siblings, I finally pulled the book out from him!  Name calling and bad mouth attitude on almost every page. I don't recommend it for families that are trying to instill values such as respect, understanding and plain old kindness into their kids.  We parents have a hard enough time nowadays filtering TV Shows and video games that are not of any educational value; I rather offer my kids  books that encourage thinking skills (such as books by Gary Paulsen).    Sadly, these books are available in schools at book fairs, so how can educators complain about kids having no respect nowadays?  Btw, this was a gift from a teacher!
031606792X|5.0|This was a terrific wrap-up for the series.  Very satisfying.  This book has lots of action and I couldn't put it down.  The best of the four books far and away.  I love the whole vampire world that Stephanie created and this book takes it to the next level!
B00008NRI8|5.0|I got exactly what I paid for.  The movie worked perfectly.  Great chick flick.
0440244870|1.0|Although \\"Shopaholic\\" was in some ways charming and funny, for the most part I found it formulaic and trite. The plot was full of cliches about a ditzy girl who makes good despite all her pitfalls, and Darcyish figures who turn out to be the real deal in the end. I felt like it was a rip-off of \\"Bridget Jones\\" in a big way; but where Helen Fielding's falling apart heroine makes me feel better, Becky makes me feel worse. Her problems are solved through the most boring deus-ex-machina possible, leaving those of us with spending problems and debt with an unrealistic MMM solution (Make More Money for those of you who haven't read the book). Like I'm supposed to suddenly land a job in TV? The letters concerning Becky's debt sprinkled through were admittedly cute, but it didn't erase the knot I felt throughout my entire reading. This book made me want to stop reading and take back that pair of shoes. I suppose that's a positive thing, but shouldn't I have wanted to finish the book before returning the shoes? I recommend this book to women with not much time on their hands, not much interest in literature, and a high tolerance for sympathetic discomfort. But for even slightly more serious readers I would not really suggest it.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|For those who have not seen Changling, give yourself a treat. Clint Eastwood, outside of being a phenomenal actor, he parallels these qualities with his directing skills. I found this film personally rewarding, because I am a native Angeleno, and found the historical tour of 1928 Los Angeles a true trip into the past. The film itself provides a great deal of frustration, mostly because of the acting skills of Angelina Jolie, who portrays the distraught mother, Christine Collins. Ms. Collins is trying to find her missing son. A boy is found, but it is the wrong boy. A good part of Changling shows how the LAPD of 1928, tries to convince her that this is really Walter (her missing son). I won't go into further details on this, since you have to see it yourself. Another acting icon, John Malkovich, who plays Rev. Gustav Briegled, provides some backbone and sanity to the film. The LAPD is a target of late twenties corruption, and in no way casts any shadow on the fine members of the current Los Angeles Police Department. Finally, the story has an unhappy ending, with justice of the time prevailing.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is an AMAZING movie. I think it is Pixar's best movie to date. It is full of laughter, sadness, and romance. You will absolutely fall in love with Wall-E because he is so adorable and sweet natured. I also love his pet cockroach.    Short Summary: Wall-E is the last robot on earth and the only other existence on earth is his pet cockroach. That is until Eve shows up looking for a plant that proves that life can still exist on earth. All of the human life is taking a vacation aboard the spaceship Axiom while Wall-E cleans up earth. The captain is making the human race slobs because the robots are doing all of the work for them. Wall-E falls in love with Eve so he follows her to Axiom and that is when he comes in contact with the captain who wants to keep the humans on the spaceship. Can Wall-E save Eve and save the humans...watch the movie to find out.    Also I loved the Pixar Short of Presto. The rabbit is so adorable in it. I think this was also Pixar's best short to date.    You will absolutely fall in love with Wall-E. Who would of ever thought that you could fall in love with a robot but you can. Overall this entire movie including the short was an amazing film. Buy dont rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
0743539125|5.0|I purchased the Audio CD to help me on my long commute to and from work.  This book made me laugh, smile, cry...all the emotions.  At the same time I was learning more intimately about Lincoln and the way that he understood people.  I would recommend this to anyone.  High School, College, or someone like me who is interested in learning more about Lincoln, his friends, his enemies and the Civil War.
B00129H7VS|5.0|One word to describe this set?  Fantastic!  HBO pulled out all of the stops with this Blu-Ray collection.  The picture is stunning, the sound is perfect, and the extras are amazing.      Hopefully, a remake of Saving Private Ryan on Blu-Ray is on the way...  for those of you with Ps3s or Blu-Ray stand-alone players, you cannot afford to pass this collection up if you're a lover of WW2 movies or just love a great story of American heroism.      If you currently own the DVD set, this Blu-Ray edition is still a must-buy.  The differences between the two (quality-wise) are breathtaking.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|You can never go wrong with Jeff's music. Lots of great riffs and some<br />serious mellow playing. His new touring bass player is a girl that can really play! Check it out if you love great guitar!!!
B000002HH9|5.0|A good majority of fans toss this album aside simply because of its unpopularity. If you actually heard all the songs you would know it is one of their more upbeat albums with a unique creative combination sound of guitar with keys all the way through. My personal favorite tracks are: 1. Want, 2. Club America, 4. The 13th, 5. Strange Attraction, 6. Mint Car, 8. Round & Round & Round, 12. Trap.
0897500482|5.0|This book could almost be called the New Testament of martial arts. Truly one of the seminal works of all martial arts writings. There is an initial chapter about zen, jeet kune do and the philosophical approach to his art, while the remainder of the book focuses on techniques, strategy and mechanics of training and fighting. This book was also influential in writing my book, The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts an in Life!<br /><br />Jeet Kune Do is the art of no art. There is no set curriculum as he calls it, \\"the formless form\\".  In constrast, traditional martial arts systems are rich and rigid in form and specific technique backed by thoroughly developed concepts and principles.<br /><br />Bruce Lee never seemed to find any practical value or purpose in kata,  often referring to it as meaningless drill.  I believe he may not have truly delved deeply enough into it to understand that while no one in their right mind would jump into a green-belt kata in the middle of a street self-defense situation, the individual movements learned through kata can be applied at will to deal with an attacker.  The founder of Aikido even said that kata should be practiced so that it could be forgotten.  The goal of all martial arts, including Jeet Kune Do is to mature to a point where movement is spontaneous.  Forethought becomes reaction,  form becomes formlessness and your actions are dictated by your opponent's responses.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you approach this goal through a rigid, forms-based system of martial arts or through Bruce Lee's formless system, the principles and analytical approach that he presents provide a wealth of technical detail and are enough to keep you busy learning, practicing and interpreting his writing for a lifetime!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  To omit it from your martial arts studies is a serious error no matter what style you study.  Open your mind; clear your mind and then fill it with the contents of this book.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Kevin Brett is the CEO of Kevin Brett Studios, Inc. and the author of The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!<br />[[ASIN:0981935001 The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!]]Kevin Brett is the CEO of Kevin Brett Studios, Inc. and the author of The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!

1591396190|4.0|A Review of \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne.    Applauding the Process    First published in 2005, this book, now more than ever, continues to extol tremendous value and should therefore be included on every marketer's shelf. As a successful professional, I maintain that the traditional marketing function is misunderstood, misappropriated and increasingly ineffectual. Utilizing practical examples, this book immediately proves valid beyond theory. Further, the authors seamlessly and, perhaps unintentionally define the distinctly different but inextricably related roles of sales and marketing. Marketing is essentially theoretical and strategic which has always been at odds with sales which is tactics and execution. Businesses that fail to rectify this inherent conflict invariably fail but, when these two functions are performed in harmony, they create a powerful machine. Since \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" is designed to avoid overt competition and inspire the creation of new markets, the corollary exists that once a truly innovative product succeeds within a formerly unknown marketplace, the sales function should be a proverbial slam dunk.    One of the critiques of this marketing theory is that there are \\"holes\\" in their data. Critics postulate this due to the lack of \\"many\\" examples of success and or, the documentation of failures. Based on my personal experience spanning nearly 30-years, I submit that the vast majority of companies simply refuse to ameliorate their \\"this is the way we've always done it\\" mentality. They firmly believe that the marketing function should drive sales when in fact, the obverse is true. \\"Brands\\" only become so, after the consumer accepts and approves but, nevertheless, far too many companies continue to design and create products only for themselves and the trade. This is great insight for all C-level, and marketing and sales VP's, Directors and Brand Managers.  A. De Rubeis
0446605409|5.0|Pros: Wise cracking gutsy detective.  Good plot that you can't see through. Excellent prose.  Some introspection and great character development. John Corey is a truly great character, and this is his debut novel.  The whole work hangs together well.<br /><br />Cons:  Wise cracking gutsy detective...OK..if you don't like the style of having a character talk to you in his thoughts, it might drive you a little nuts, but personally, I think its great.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Nelson DeMille is probably my favorite modern day author.  I love his blend of wit, wisdom, sarcasm, and story telling.  You can pick up any one of his books and be just plain entertained.  I do recommend doing the John Corey series in order, which is:  Plum Island, The Lion's Game, Night Fall,  Wild Fire.  If you're going to try Nelson DeMille, I recommend starting with Plum Island...if you're entertained, proceed, if you distinctly don't like the style, then its best to stop because his writing style is similar throughout his books.  One last thing....if you do audio books like I do...then these are great listening, and I think Scott Brick is the best.  To me, Scott Brick IS John Corey.
B000W10AEI|4.0|I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not \\"Lord Of The Rings,\\" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the lot.    The special-effects are fun to watch and it was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff (\\"Harry\\"), Emma Watson (\\"Hermione\\") and Rupert Grint (\\"Ron\\") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. \\"Ron\\" squeaks half the time he talks!    As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. It's definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language, and the Blu-Ray editions eleveate this DVD another star.  The transfers on all of them, from what I've seen and read, are fantastic.
B000JIJPZY|4.0|Surprised that the reviews aren't a little higher overall for this product, but I guess as always, different things appeal to different kids and parents. Our 3-month old has had this gym for a few weeks and she really enjoys her time on/in it. We have it set up so she can kick at the swinging tiger and the tunes it plays are quite cute and not annoying - a real plus. The little 'pillow' head rest thingy is pointless, but other than that we're very pleased with this purchase. Are there really tigers and giraffes in rainforests? I guess I won't let that bug me too much ...
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Here is an outstanding film by Clint Eastwood which features Angelina Jolie in a performance that is as powerful as anyone's has been.  Yet the Academy has all but shut out both of them recently.  What gives?       On to the film:  Christine Collins is the anguished yet strong mother whose son is taken while she's at work.  It's 1928, and the LAPD doesn't want the embarrassment of people knowing they screwed up and gave her back the wrong kid.  Collins is carted off to the insane asylum--a real horror chamber--and pressured to make false statements.  But she's too strong and savvy to give in.  She has some help from a minister, played ably by John Malkovich, who broadcasts via radio about her plight. Without him, she might not have gotten as far as she did.      There's another theme in this film about the poor status of women at that time; they were thought of as only running on impulse and emotion, and were not taken seriously.       I should caution sensitive viewers that there are some disturbing scenes involving the aforementioned asylum, a serial killer, and his subsequent fate.  This is not for the faint of heart.

B001GQACGO|4.0|Briefly: I have never been a major fan of her music, but I am certainly am not a hater. I liked some of her stuff, but not all. However, listening to this one, I like it- a lot. Maybe b/c it is different that's why I like it so much. The Beyonce' side is very mellow, romantic and very touching. For someone who doesn't talk about her relationship much, you can start to get a feel for her feelings for Jay-Z through these songs. And, on the Sasha Fierce side, I like all of them, too. I don't love the idea of her making \\"Diva\\" the 2nd single from that side of the album, b/c they're a lot better songs, like \\"Radio\\". Overall, I like the album.  One piece of advice, b/c I'm hearing people complain about how it should've been on one CD, solution: Buy the deluxe version on iTunes so that it'll be on one disc! That's what I did, and I'm glad I did. No need to switch Cd's after 6 songs!
B000286RNY|5.0|I first heard about this movie years ago from my younger brother. A friend of his had a bootleg of it that had been fansubbed. My brother raved that it was hilarious. I wasnt too keen on it at first since I'm not a big soccer fan but when he brought it over I was hooked. It's just brilliant. The effects are just so over the top and ridiculous that you just cant help but laugh, and they're done that way on purpose. My favorite scenes are when  Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head sing in the club, I was laughing so hard I had to step out to catch my breath, and the first game they play, against the local gang of ruffians and Steel Leg is on his back and it turns into a war movie scene, that was classic. I definetly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh and enjoy some great martial art effects. Plus how can you not love a movie in which the bad guys are literally called Team Evil. I mean come on that's just cheekiness at it's best. Do yourself a favor and buy this along with Kung Fu Hustle. I did!
078322804X|5.0|Buying the Blues Brother Movie is the thing. It is a classic and was an immediate classic even when it first came out. How many other films capture this number of star entertainers (Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Jim Brown, Howlin' Wolf, etc...) and tie it all together into an amzing story with non stop action and deadpan humor - the elegant restaurant scene with Jake and Elwood making a spectacle of themselves, or the Blues Brothers playing the gig at a rural Country & Western Bar and playing \\"Rawhide\\" would be enough to want to see this film. And these are just a few classic moments.  truly, it was fortunate and perhaps brilliant that John Landis and the creators of this film gave the production the green light to film while all of these legendary were still alive and had plenty of kick left in them to show the audience what real rhythm & blues and soul music were like by the people who created it. And then there are Belushi and Akroyd at the top of their comical genius, before Belushi went over the deep end with drugs and Akroyd swallowed beluga whale.   And then there are the chase scenes. Just buy it and enjoy.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you like unbelievable scenery, animals, and a cool British voice-over then this blu-ray is for you. I'm a big fan of scenery and this blu-ray is probably the definitive way of showing off how high quality a picture you can get. There are scenes with thousands of birds taking off and you can see every individual one. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see what the blu-ray is capable of, for anyone who loves nature documentaries and just to see how awesome our world is.

B0002E5O9G|5.0|What makes this the best album for me?  The combination of the excellent cast and the extended length. This concert was an abridged version of the play, and the live performances give it a certain energy that the other albums lack.  Certain scenes are missing, like Javert's Intervention, but you can still follow the plot.  Now it's hard for me to listen to the Broadway and London albums without thinking about how short the tracks are.  Many cast members are clearly too old for their parts, but who cares?  They sound great!<br /><br />In general, I like the male cast members better on this album than the London Album.  Colm Wilkinson's performance is a little weaker, but he is still better than Gary Morris from the Complete Symphonic Recording.  Michael Ball plays an excellent Marius, as usual. Michael Maguire is the patriotic Enjolras, and Alun Armstrong gives an even better performance as Thenardier this time around.  But the real show stealer here is Philip Quast as Javert.  This man can act intensely as well as sing beautifully.  His version of Stars is my favorite song out of all four Les Mis recordings.  It helps to watch the performance on the DVD.  The look on his face is always so intense. His Javert is someone you don't want to mess with.  I must also compliment the Bishop.  His role may be small but he is one of the highlights of the album for me.<br /><br />I find the women to be better on the London Album, except for Jenny Galloway.  She's hilarious as Madam Thenardier.  While all the female cast members give respectable performances, I find Lea Salonga's Eponine to be a little robotic.  Ruthie Henshall is a decent Fantine but I just don't think her voice is nearly as good as LuPone's, but I seem to be in the minority.  Judy Khun is probably the best lady in the cast, she makes a very good Cosette. But all in all this album has a well balanced cast; there is not a severely weak link in the chain like in the London and Broadway albums.  The songs are backed up by a very large chorus, made up of former Les Mis cast members, which makes each song seem epic.<br /><br />Another reason to buy this album is the performance of \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" by an international cast of Jan Val Jeans.  Each performer only has one line but it is fun to compare them.  The Irish Jean val Jean really blew everyone else out of the water.  From the Japanese singer's performance I would imagine the whole play must sound very nice in Japanese.<br /><br />The album has a few flaws.  As I mentioned before, Colm Wilkinson's performance is inferior to his earlier performances.  A balloon pops during \\"Castle on a Cloud.\\"  I do not listen to that song very often but if it is one of your favorites I would imagine it would be very annoying.  The great Michael Maguire cracks on a few high notes, unfortunately.<br /><br />Nevertheless if you are going to buy one Les Mis album, this should be it.  Great sound quality, great cast, great orchestra.y large chorus, made up of former Les Mis cast members, which makes each song seem epic.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I started my wild goose hunt for the perfect mobile for my 2 month old daughter and all I saw was these pastel, \\"just for looks\\" mobiles that wind up and play one song. Most of them were too pricey for just a \\"cute\\" mobile. But we wanted to find one with bright, bold colors that would grab her attention. When I saw this one I knew that this one was it. Yes it is kinda pricey, but keep in mind that all mobiles are around $20 or $30. When it arrived in the mail, I instantly hooked it up and put her in her crib. It started to move up and down and all around, and she smiled the biggest smile that we have ever seen. She started cooing and \\"talking\\" to it, and thats when we knew that it was WELL WORTH IT!!! If you are thinking about buying this for your little one then I strongly recommend it. Your child will love it...wait and see!       BTW---check out the 2 pictures that we posted of our little girl in her pink room...
B00129H7VS|5.0|Picked this up from Amazon on Bluray at a great price. I had been wanting to watch this for a long time. Well, I finally did. And this is one extraordinary series. Once I started watching it, I could not stop. The acting is uniformly superb. No big box-office names, but you will recognize many of the actors. Great pacing and continuity on the story. First rate special effects. As we're introduced to the people in this, we begin to know and care about all of them. Donnie Wahlberg really is an excellent actor. Though his brother Mark has had more box office success, I think Donnie is a more well-rounded and nuanced actor. Also retired Capt. Dale Dye is in this. He is always good. While others pretend to be military, all he has to do is be himself. From start to finish, an emotional and entertaining masterpiece. If you like war/military movies or series, this is the one to watch. It won't be the last time I watch it.

B000E1JOSE|5.0|Roy Orbison was incredibly talented and unique. He has been called the only operatic rock-a-billy singer. What a voice. There is a rumor regarding Roy and Elvis Presley. In the very early days, when Roy and Elvis were both at Sun records. It's been said that Elvis was so impressed by Roy's voice he tried to emulate him. Listen to both closely and see what you think. By all accounts he was also a very quiet, humble, and personable man. Who knew he would be leaving us so soon after this was made. And what a wonderful tribute this is. All his hits are here. And the performances are superb. The who's who of backup muscians and singers is impressive. The sound quality is awesome. This is as good as these songs have ever sounded, and it was live! The video quality does vary a bit. Mostly sharp, it is sometimes soft or grainy looking, maybe intentionally? During the songs it's mostly excellent. It's in between songs where the picture quality fluctuates. I had tickets to see Roy in 1975 at a relatively small venue close to where I live. Unfortunatley, it was cancelled, and I never did get see him live. I wish I had. Anyway, I remain a lifelong fan of Roys. This is as an outstanding concert and tribute to him. A must have for all fans.
B000002IRL|5.0|THIS album came out in 1991. i remember playing it in my car and headbanging going to school. it still rocks today when other thrash metal groups get better exposure than these \\"old school\\" thrash metal experts do. It should be noted that the new metal or thrash groups learned how to play by listening to old bands. OVERKILL rocks and they will always do because they always put out great albums. buy this one if you are an OVERKILL fan . It wont dissapoint.

B000002GLV|5.0|Don't let the word \\"Fusion\\" in the title of this recording throw you off or steer you wrong - this is not Weather Report or anything like that ueber-cerebral naval-gazing.

B000001F7R|5.0|How come it seems like the only people who don't like his album are Def Leppard themselves? Real metal fans love this record as the powerhouse riffs and leaden production make `On Through the Night' one of the shining beacons of the NWOBHM! In several interviews Joe Elliot has said that he cringes or needs to drink heavily to listen to this record and that bothers me when the artists don't love their work as much as the fans do; are we stupid or something? To Joe I say, forget you! Yes your vocal style is terribly underdeveloped and the lyrics may seem naïve and juvenile but I love it! \\"Rock Brigade\\", \\"Wasted\\", \\"Hello America\\", \\"Satellite\\", \\"Sorrow Is a Woman (could be their best ballad ever, I'm not kidding....\\"Hysteria\\"????? PLEASE!!!), \\"Answer to the Master\\" and \\"Overture\\" deserve mention as among the best songs that the Lepps ever did.  I ask you, did the band improve that dramatically that they can kiss off `OTTN'??  It doesn't matter that Mutt Lange wasn't there. If you are among the masses who bemoan that the fact that Def Leppard long ago stop trying to be UFO and Thin Lizzy and tried to be the English Bon Jovi then you probably already have this LP and its follow-up. But for the others who can't believe Def Leppard was ever a metal band...then get this record...won't you help me get out??? Sorry Joe, your real fans love `On Through the Night\\" and there is nothing you can do about it! Now shut up and take a little trip down to CALIFORN -I -A!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been using this DVD for about a month now and I love it.  I've been doing it 3 or 4 days a week, adding it to a regimen of jogging 20-30 minutes 3 days a week.  Since I started the 30 Day Shred my posture has improved dramatically, my upper back is more toned. My arms and legs also look more toned and I think my abs have changed the most.   My husband has noticed the changes too.      I've tried a slew of workout videos (tae bo, The Firm, etc.....) and like this one the most because 1) I can easily fit a 20 min routine into my day, 2) the routine is not \\"dancy\\", it is made up of very basic/traditional yet effective exercises.  3) I love the combination of 3 min strength/2 min cardio/1 min abs.  She keeps you moving the whole time and you're able to get great results in a 20 min workout because you're working out many muscle groups at the same time.      I hope Jillian comes out with additional versions of the 30 day shred.  I'd love a version with another circuit or two to make the routine slightly longer on days when I have the time.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I previously owned the DVD version of BOB (which I believe is the finest war mini-series ever created), and was debating on whether or not to re-purchase something I already own (granted it was on BD). I was a bit concerned that due to the way BOB was shot (dull color hues, and grainy filter) that it would not benefit much from Blu-Ray.    Conclusion: For a lover of the BOB series this is a must buy! The video has been noticeably enhanced, mostly noticeable by improved color contrast and a sharper picture. As for the sound... spectacular! One of the few knocks I had on the original DVD release was the audio during certain dialog... that has been fixed, and the uncompressed HD surround audio is fantastic (noticeably better than its DVD counterpart)! The extras have been getting somewhat poor reviews. I believe a lot of this is due to the fact that there isn't A LOT new. I believe however that the FEW new additions are phenomenal e.g. Time Line and Paratrooper commentaries.    What are you waiting for?! And for the price?!
0525951113|1.0|This is a good example of a clever plot idea gone horribly wrong.  The books premise is initially quite interesting until bodies and blood take over and character development stops.  The idea that a lone individual dying of brain cancer could develop such a wide-ranging and individually interactive system that can actually predict behavior quite accurately (down to conversational responses!) is simply ludicrous.  As noted by other reviewers, the ending is clearly set up for a sequel shich I will not be buying.

0545128285|1.0|It's hard to be critical of a book sold for charity. Still I feel that it is unfair to her fans and readers to sell this as part of the Harry Potter franchise.    With the exception of the inclusion of The Tale of the Three Brothers that is referenced in Book 7, this book has NOTHING to do with Harry Potter, it's characters or stories.    Don't believe the cover or description, this book is simply a collection of decent short fairy tales, having essentially nothing to do with Harry Potter.    Save your money and send it to the charity of YOUR choice.

If you like a bit of wackiness with your outstanding music, then Zappa's your man.  \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\" introduces us to Nanook.  \\"Nanook Rubs It\\" involves Nanook and his epic battle with the fur trapper.  Next comes \\"St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast\\" (where I stole the margarine).  Included are \\"Cosmic Debris\\", \\"Excentrifical Forz\\", \\"Father O'Blivion\\", \\"Apostrophe\\" (another brilliant Zappa solo), \\"Uncle Remus\\" (I'll be knocking the jockeys off the lawn) and \\"Stink Foot\\", which I find to be just plain hilarious.

0316017922|3.0|In short, most of the criticism listed here is accurate. This is a highly entertaining book, but lacks any credible research and is prone to making sweeping generalizations based on Gladwell's personal theories.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This is my 2nd contribution to my Blu-ray collect (1st being BBC Ed Planet Earth) and I cant tell you how proud I am to be an owner of the Band of Brothers!     First impression the tin box was in perfect condition with embossed letters on it. as you open up the box there will be 6 disc which comes out in accordion style along with some really nicely designed photos from the scenes in B.o.B.    In a nutshell, if you like Saving Private Ryan, you will love every bit about B.o.B. because it is an even more detailed version of S.P.R. What I liked about B.o.B. is that you get to not only feel how it's like behind the front line the world's biggest war, but you also get to see many different aspect of the war. How the group break apart when led by an inferior leader, or what it was like to be a combat medic in the front line, or how everyone mentally gets through the pressure from being attacked, or even the reality of how fragile life really is during the time of war.    The image quality is unforgettable especially at the last few episodes :D    Overall it's very very well done piece. I wished it was longer than 10 episodes but I think I can say that to all the good things in life :)
074356619X|5.0|The Secret    I was told about this book about a year ago and didn't think much more about it. I wish I had. I purchased The Secret on audio book three weeks ago and have listened to it almost everyday. I want to share some of my thoughts and experiences I have had since receiving this book.   Learning about the Secret  Upon learning that the Secret was a law of nature, the whole book took on a new meaning for me. I love to dabble in quantum mechanics, which is what I thought this was going to be about. It has a little bit of quanta in there, but I was amazed to find that all the things I needed and wanted were stuck in my head. All I had to do was be happy, say what I wanted and let the good times roll!  How to use The Secret  There are three steps to the law of attraction. Step one is ask. Ask for what you want and throw it out there. Step two is to believe. You have to believe that what you asked for is already yours; you are just waiting on it to show up. Step three is receive. Just receive what you wanted with gratitude, love and joy.  Examples of what I have done  I have done simple things to test the law of attraction. Here's the first one. I deliver pizza so while I am driving I smile. I think about how silly I must look and I start to smile bigger and even giggle. By the time I am at my delivery point, I am in a very good mood. This has made my tips bigger. I have visualized parking spaces in front of where I work, in Wal Mart, and at Wayne College. I may not get the exact space I want, but I am within 2 spaces, so I don't have to walk as far in the cold.   I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it to everyone.(KRC)

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|OK, I'm a huge Portishead fan like everyone else reviewing this I guess, and I loved the moody trip hop or whatever you call it that we had come to expect. Well this aint it. Just so you know, this aint it. Its still moody and depressing but its not Sour Times or Cowboys.But its still a great albulm if...If you like electronic music, if you like moody music and if you don't mind a certain amount of musical experimentation, this is a great album. I'm glad I bought it and I plan on listening to it for a while before I get tired of it. The only reason I don't give it a perfect rating is that becasue of the experimental nature it seems disjointed at times and the album doesn't have the singular musical vision that 2nd album had. Buy it if you like electronic or industrial music. Skip it if you want Dummy part 2.
0671665707|2.0|For years, Lefty Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro were two of Las Vegas's heaviest hitters, Chicago boys who moved West to take advantage of easy money and short odds. Lefty was bright and worked through the system, however corrupt. Tony was a bully who shook things up while looking out for himself.<br /><br />The two characters are the center of Nicholas Pileggi's \\"Casino\\", a true-crime account of Vegas during the 1970s and 1980s, when organized crime used the gambling mecca as its own private money tree.<br /><br />Published in 1995 as a tie-in to the Martin Scorsese movie, \\"Casino\\" the book is slightly different in that it offers the real story rather than the fictionalized version seen in the film. The characters don't pop off the page the way they do off the screen, but they are better grounded by reality.<br /><br />As with his earlier book \\"Wise Guy\\" (made into another Scorsese movie, \\"Goodfellas\\"), Pileggi works with a lot of first-hand testimony. He captures a sense of really hearing these guys as you read the pages, tuning into their hard world. But a couple of serious problems soon present themselves.<br /><br />The first is that Pileggi doesn't have the same kind of story he did with \\"Wise Guy\\". Instead of the record Lufthansa airport heist memorably depicted there, you get a long story about how Tony got mad when someone failed to show Gregory Peck's secretary a good-enough time in Vegas. Pileggi offers this as an example of the scut work that made Tony restless and difficult within the Mob, but it's also the kind of smallball that makes \\"Casino\\" feel less vital over time. People coming to this after seeing the movie are going to be surprised by the relative lack of violence here. How many times can you read about crimes that largely occurred inside balance books?<br /><br />The second issue is Pileggi's way of relying almost exclusively on first-hand testimony, especially from Rosenthal. Lefty comes across as a charmer, but also by his own account too removed from the illegal aspect of the story. That may be Rosenthal's own spin; the guy who was Rosenthal's nominal boss calls him a liar and psychopath who was at the center of the mob skims. Rosenthal denies any knowledge of skims.<br /><br />This flies straight in the face of the portrait Pileggi paints, of Lefty being so detail obsessed he counts blueberries in the muffins his casino restaurants serve. Yet Pileggi leaves Rosenthal's denial unchallenged in his minimal narration. In fact, he doesn't provide much textual background for anything in \\"Casino\\", including how important Rosenthal and Spilotro ultimately were to the Mob in Vegas, just that Rosenthal was good at gambling while Spilotro knocked over some jewelry stores.<br /><br />Pileggi also gets a lot of mileage out of how Tony two-timed Lefty with Lefty's gorgeous gold-digger wife. Geri Rosenthal's probably the most interesting character, a force of will who demands everything she can from life. She isn't sympathetic, but neither is anyone else in this one-note book. That kind of grates after a while.ed from the illegal aspect of the story.

0767800958|5.0|My late son recommended this, years ago, and I've loved it ever since having first viewed it on the IFC (cable). \\"Libertango\\" is a beautifully  haunting composition that stays in my mind and returns the memory of the amazingly beautiful choreographed dance numbers in this jewel of a film. Sally Potter is a triumph in this most personal journey shared with us. Thank Argentina for the TANGO! The world of dance SINGS with its addition.

B001BGTWXI|5.0|This is by far their best effort to date. Being a long time fan since '99, this album pleases on many levels generally because of the album's lack of filler, the one aspect that generally plagues every other album by them.     Iowa and Vol.3 have more than their share of jams but they have a ton of filler and half baked ideas/songs that werent fully fleshed out... this album is solid and comprehensive from top to bottom. There is no need to skip songs or make your own custom disc of this. Press play and forget about it.     Also this is by far the most serious, professional release theyve done. They've finally put everything together on this disc. Its heavy and riff crazy without being over the top for the sake of being over the top.     Its also the strongest album in their catalog lyrically.     Only the Hot Topic portion of their fanbase would dislike this album.     Stay (sic)
B001ANSS5K|4.0|green does a nice job of capturing the personality of the average teen boy in this novel. though the book has a few sections that drag there are many great parts making it worth reading. i found myself laughing to tears during part three. check it out itmay surprise you
B001H5X7I4|2.0|OOh gosh...Where do I begging, this movie is perhaps the most overrated movie of 2008.Like Borat in 2006, evryone kept saying that it's the funniest movie ever, which it wasn't. I don't recall laughing at all in Borat...it was stupid and lame. Same here in Tropic Thunder, I didn't see the humor. the only joke from Stiller I found kinda funny was when the little Vietnamese kid starts hitting Stiller and he accidentally does the voice of Simple Jack...other than that..Nothing from Stiller. Downey Jr had a lot of good moments. But the whole Tom Cruise thing was way overrated.<br /><br />Now for those wanting to know what this movie is, or what it was trying to do was pretty much spoof on war films...unsuccessfully though. Tropic Thunder's main problem is that it tries way too hard with the jokes; every joke felt as if it was just made to chuckle...Not really laugh at. Now on the other hand Jack Black saved some parts of the movie, he gave this film what it was mainly lacking...which was humor.<br /><br />So overall this is not a movie I would have in my collection, I saw it once and regretted buying it, now I have to sell it. If you are curious rent it...but if you want a good comedy watch instead Office Space, Meet the Parents or Superbad...now those movies are funny and smart.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5
B001KZVQJI|4.0|Great Movie to watch on Blu-ray, but with the extended version  disk, I had to upgrade my Blu-ray to view........    But, it was still worth every penny to watch....
0312427999|2.0|Steeped in current events and a flood of Bush/Cheney corruption witnessed firsthand in Baghdad, Klein's thesis is a statement of the obvious. Sprinkling her message with modern psychology, similar to the notion of religion providing a parent for the crisis of death, Klein claims we return to a childish state, desirous of a parent in any social crisis. During such crises those in power - politicians, industrialists - take advantage for their own gain at the expense of the rest of us and earth's environment. Klein then uses abuses of capitalism to indict capitalism as an economic form.     While her point is valid her book is not exactly opaque in its agenda, though her lectures come cleaner, rounding out the kinder, gentler oppression she favors over and above that we've just escaped. For Klein we have an opportunity to accept willingly our new parents to provide us a planned utopia in our here-and-now under the righteous thumb of an all-knowing State. Hence she uses the very thesis she claims to abhor to further her own party's preferences. While the past administration used 9/11 as a crisis to impose their rule (and fatten their corporate contributors - see RFK's \\"Crimes Against Nature\\"), the current economic crisis is somehow not leveraged by her political party. She indicts a Republican who said, \\"Crisis is when you can make people do things\\", but not Rahm Emanuel's now infamous remark to never waste a good crisis (precisely her thesis). Midnight releases of the \\"stimulus\\" bill, according well with her claims of limiting information by manipulators; redirections of wealth, thus agreeing with her motive, and yet despite these agreements with her central theme, this time, for her administration, it really is, truly, \\"trust me\\", different from her thesis of deceit. Her party would never take advantage as all is for the good of humankind and Bambi. Klein puts a well-deserved light on the ugly side of globalization, political manipulation, and public costs of the sameold clans present since Sumer invented the city, but Klein is incapable of seeing the same abuse by her own favorites.    As so many on the Left are now fond of doing, those dead (white) males unable to talk back make great targets for Klein. Milton Friedman may be her favorite (naturally the Great Boogieman, Ronald Reagan, is ever-present). But Friedman was a student of Hayek, who writes plainly in \\"The Road To Serfdom\\" that no free market is free of rational limits and regulation. Just as government should be limited (a notion Klein supports for Republican administrations) so too should commerce, preferably by rule of rational, dispassionate laws based on reason, not politics. Undeterred by facts, Klein uses the current economic situation (enabled by shenanigans from both parties) to promote our current movement by claiming free market capitalism means no rules nor regulations. As Michael Polanyi (besides von Mises, Hayek's mentor) wrote, this is just what socialists want us to believe in order to insert their plan of collectivism. Klein would do well to study Michael's brother Karl (a staunch socialist) and his book \\"The Great Transformation\\" (ironically, written in the same year as \\"Serfdom\\"), for articulate arguments to service her cause rather than employing our modern impersonations of reason, which are mere calculation.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This show was well made.  It gives you a history lesson of our countrymen in World War 2.  Worth the purchase.
B001DEXDNI|5.0|I am so happy to have the cd of The Annie Lennox Collection.  Its the best of the best of her four solo albums.  Some of these songs might not stand out as \\"hits\\" to some people as some were hits in the UK and werent hits in the USA also a couple are fan favorites but all were singles (except for the two new songs \\"Shining Light\\" & \\"Pattern Of MY Life\\") which are both beautiful songs.  Shining Light reminds me of THe Tourists..the band Annie was in with Dave Stewart before forming Eurythmics..I guess the closest to sounding like Shining Light from any Eurythmics song was probably There Must Be An Angel...its very refreshing and fun.    The collection is wonderful..also check out The Ultimate Collection by EURYTHMICS too if you havent already for Annie's best work with Dave as Eurythmics!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|The 30-Day Shred is an excellent at-home workout.  I have been working out and playing sports for years and am an active martial artist. I STILL found even the Level One workouts to be challenging. Jillian packs a lot into just 20 minutes.  Will you lose up to 20 pounds in 30 Days?  I don't know. Probably not, but you will feel strong and more coordinated and have better endurance.  You will probably see improved muscle tone and will probably lose inches more than pounds, especially if you are already close to your healthy weight range. Everyone is different.    This workout is not for beginners. The Shred is difficult, though I found it a little easier than Making the Cut, which can take 30 to 60 minutes per session and requires more equipment and space to work out.  The Shred just requires a mat, hand weights (I'd suggest nothing heavier than 8 pounds each until you get used to the routines), and your willingness to push yourself and bust a sweat.  It's a good investment if you need an effective workout in a short amount of time, and workout space in your home is at a premium.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I own both the Blu-Ray and the DVD Version. I must say that The Dark Knight is one of the best comic movies to come out on Blu Ray right now.  My only complaint is that it does not have a PCM 5.1 Track.  The picture quality is indeed amazing. Although the IMAX scenes were cut a bit, which I was bummed about, but it was necessary to fit the aspect ratio of HDTVs.  If you ever get a chance though, try the IMAX experience of the film.  The picture is incredible.  I would only recommend this version of the film only if you have a 26' or above HDTV and a 5.1 sound system that has the Dolby TrueHD Codec.  Otherwise, you' re good with the DVD version if you're 2 out of the Millions of people who don't already own it already. LOL.
0805082662|5.0|it is good, better than polar bear or panda bear book, it is easier than the other books,  read to kids in this order:  brown bear, then polar bear, then  baby bear, then panda bear book. all 4 are good, but very similar
B000006NXP|5.0|Brahms' 4th symphony (somewhat easy to perform acceptably, painstakingly hard to execute brilliantly!) poses a challenge for orchestras and conductors alike. Complex and shifting metric structures, broad, exuberant, often non-linear melodies, conservative instrumentation yet progressive orchestration; it is an exercise in rhythmic rigor, melodic ardor and textural management.    The catalog is blessed with dozens of recordings and many of them are nothing short of fantastic. I particularly cherish Abbado's 1992 BPO account for its romantic lyricism and luscious sound, Solti's 1978 recording with Chicago for its orchestral virtuosity and dramatic narrative, and, finally, George Szell's account in Cleveland, memorable mainly for its rhythmic and textural clarity. Each of them is brilliant in their own way, but none are all-emcompassing. Abbado's romantic rubato smudges metric patterns, Szell's perfect balance and clarity hinders lyric abandon, etc. Kleiber somehow encompasses all of those strengths, at no sacrifice. The result is exhilarating.    Kleiber masterfully morphs metric rigor into relentless drive, providing rhythmic stability yet sufficient ardor for melodies to soar. Textures revolve around the same principle: rigorous, focused accompaniments with passionate, fiery melodies. The Vienna Philharmonic, while not usually one of my favorite bands, are perfect. They bring an old-world quality to the recording and it still breathes freshness and consummate artistry. The strings are simply breathtaking in their malleability and nobility.    The sound is typical VPO: Dominating, rich, incandescent, strings and recessed, somewhat homogeneous winds. One could perhaps hope for a tad more sonic detail (especially for the woodwinds' sake), but the overall result is more than satisfying.     This is a rare recording and should be on any musician's shelves! With formidable insight and glorious playing, I recommend wholeheartedly!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|The special features are more than worth the money, even if you've seen the feature many times.  Commentary: The Musical is unbelievably entertaining, the ELE videos are fun, and there are some VERY well-hidden easter eggs.      However, the DVD itself has some issues.  It doesn't work in any computer or game console I've tried, and even in DVD players where it does work, the disk makes loud sounds and isn't completely reliable.  Also note that I have the non-recordable media version.
B000M0XJ88|4.0|Nice automatic watch. As most of Seiko 5 series goes a bit fast, but only a couple seconds per day. To be expected with almost any automatic watch. Nylon strap makes it look small at 18mm on a bigger wrist. The lugs could be a bit bigger 20mm or more. I bought I new 20mm Zulu band it fits works well and looks a lot better. 4 Sars because I wish the band would have been better.
1594481717|5.0|If you've ever tried to sell design, clever writing, inspiring music, or any other product of creativity to an eye-rolling left-brain executive, who usually holds the purse strings, A WHOLE NEW MIND arms you with facts and research that appeal to the bean-counting world. Pink's book is rich with observations and aptly communicates the value of right-brain thinking, while preserving left-brain egos. Although it was written at the beginning of the end of our \\"good\\" economy, which has some effect on how we can interpret some of the message today, the principles he introduces remain relevant.
B000I0RNV6|1.0|The previews make one think it is a sweet movie about a child who yearns to run a movie projector.  That it is, BUT the previews leave out profanity and offensive hand gestures the director makes the children say and do.  If I were to imitate in public what the children did in the movie, I would be arrested for public indecency and have to register as a sex offender.  And, there are adults that engage in very offensive acts.  It is porn and sadly very troubling because the children are made to engage in very blatant immoral activities.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I have spent most of my life hearing about the LONESOME DOVE Mini-Series but never watched it until recently.  I can't believe what I have been missing all of these years - what a great movie!  The story at face value is about the 2,000 mile cattle drive that two ex-Rangers make from Lonesome Dove to Montana; the TRUE story is about the bond of two life long friends: Captains Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones) and Augustus McCrae (Robert Duvall), the maturing of a young boy Newt, and the hardships and life-lessons learned along the way.<br /><br />  This series is the epitome of \\"the western\\": there is plenty of gunfighting, cattle-driving, and outlaw-chasing - but this movie really tops them all in terms of the overlying story that unfolds during it all.  Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall shine as their comraderie and friendship is displayed on screen.  You see how each handles loss and love in his own way - and how each has differing effects on the men that they lead. It also shows the maturing of a young man, Newt Dobbs (Rick Schroder), as he goes from awkward boy to steadfast cowhand through the mentoring of the two Captains and Scout Joshua Deets (Danny Glover), while also being influenced by ex-Ranger Jake Spoon (Robert Urich).<br /><br />  Lonesome Dove is a movie that delivers plenty of action, adventure, humor, and tragedy - and does it with class and panache.  You get to know and love (or really hate) the characters presented.  I know, Six hours sounds like a long time, but after six hours you are actually left wanting more and hate the fact that it ended.<br /><br />  I could not recommend this movie/mini-series highly enough.  Immediately after finishing it, I went out and bought the book - just to get more insight into the characters presented.  Even if you are not a huge western fan, the presentation, story-line, and characters will keep you entertained for hours.
B00000K3CM|1.0|After reading all the rave reviews, I figured my children would enjoy this movie - after all, they thought HA3 was hysterical.  We were so surprised to find that HA2 was just plain weird!  The kids were bored, and creeped out by the NYC scenes (they are 7 & 9).  We did not finish watching it.  Give me the original any day!
0143034901|4.0|I find it interesting that so many reviewers criticize the novel for being too long and then go on to write reviews that are too long. I'm sure much of the criticism stems from the fact that it is a translation. Just read it and know that you will not be wasting your time if you do. And know that for six friends from Atlanta who read it it and loved it was the impetus for our trip to Barcelona the year after. Any book that can do that is worth the read.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|THE PRODUCT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION HAD MY DOUBTS AT FIRST AND WHEN I OPENED UP THE DVD THE DVD LOOKED LIKE THEY MIGHT BE BOOTLEG BUT THEY WERENT. THEY HAD THE DISNEY NAME INSCRIBED ON THE DVD AND THE QUALITY WAS AS IF I BOUGHT IT FROM A RETAIL STORE. I PLAN ON ORDERING MOVIES I CANT FIND ELSEWHERE THROUGH AMAZON MORE OFTEN. THE SHIPPING TOOK A FEW DAYS BUT THATS NORMAL SO GOOD SERVICE, QUALITY GOODS AND A SATIFIED CUSTOMER!
B00129H7VS|5.0|If you're not familiar with this mini-series then this is a must buy.  In my opinion this is a film everyone should watch, in order to understand the sacrifices made by these soldiers, to help ensure our freedoms and to return these freedoms to others.  It is graphic and somewhat `theatrical' at times, but not over the top, it doesn't have to be, the story is powerful enough by itself.    If you are familiar with the series, then you should also buy this.  I owned the same box set on DVD, but when you watch it on Blu-ray, it's a completely new experience.    I bought this on sale at on Amazon for under $40.  I paid more than that for the DVD set I bought a couple of years ago.  This price was nearly half of what I had found in stores, so it's a great deal.
B001F290E4|2.0|I really love Seal, but I was disappointed because he did a lot of remakes.  I was hoping to get more of his original sound and music.  I gave it a two because the music was still good, but I think Seal was lazy on this one and just out to make a buck.
B00129H7VS|4.0|Package arrived in time.  However, when it arrived, I was very nervous.  The box from Amazon was covered in black dust/dirt.  Looked like it was thrown into a fire pit before it was shipped.  Once I was able to open the box, the product looked great.  Unfortunately, when I went to watch the first segment, my blu-ray player wouldn't eject the DVD I already had in it!  So, I haven't been able to watch Band of Bros yet since I have to ship my player in to get repaired.  Looking forward to watching though!
0385341075|4.0|An interesting and unusual story that unfolds on an island in Papua New Guinea, it's narrated by Matilda, a thoughtful young 13 year old who lives with her mother during the turbulent times of civil war. The story begins as all villagers who are able, flee the island for safer grounds. A few islanders either can't or won't leave, among them a handful of neighbors, mostly women and children, a couple of older men, and a very odd white guy named Pop Eye and his black wife.   Supply boats no longer stop with goods, the school teachers have left and there is no gas for the generators. The remaining folks make do with what fish they can catch, the abundance of the tropical fruit and vegetables, a few pigs and chickens.  They live a life of survival, in daily fear of the redskins and the rebels - the two warring factions. The children miss going to school until one day the only white person left on the island volunteers to take on this task.    Mr. Watts , commonly known as Pop Eye,  is odd, he walks around with a red clown nose and dragging his quiet, unsmiling wife in a trolly.  He promises the kids to do his best and allows for the fact that he won't be able to answer all their questions.   What he can do is give them something to look forward to.  He introduces the children to the book, Great Expectations, where they meet Mr. Pip. He reads them a chapter a day, and the kids are enthralled.  Watts gently and slowly allows the kids to experiment with their imaginations, to travel to another world without leaving the classroom and to dream of a life without rebels and redskins. At the same time, Matilda is so enthusiastic with this book that she causes her mother to feel pushed aside. This causes quite a mother/daughter rift which I thought was brilliantly explored.    Along the way, the civil war comes front and center to their town and unimaginable, horrific atrocities occur, which (as a friend in Serbia so eloquently reminded me.)are a common thread in all civil wars.At at this point in the narrative, the writing went flat, the author glazed over the disturbing bits and I'm still out on a limb on this.  I found it didn't work well with the rest of the book.  But, I actually think it could have been intentional on the author's part to not dwell on these events, as Mr Watts' importance was not in the ending, but in imparting a love of words, of storytelling, of books and authors. He was able, for a few short months, to give the island kids - who had nothing more than the rags on their backs, an escape, an illusion, and something to look forward to in those days of incredible trials and suffering.    Matilda moves on, grows up and deals with her blackness in a white world.  She learns the real meaning of her time with Pop Eye/Mr. Watts and comes out of it a better person.     So even with a flat portion, this book caught my attention and kept it running all the way through.

A cashier at a store in Julian noticed the book and said it was great and I should give it time and I did. 4 days later and a lot less sleep and all I can say is wow! I am ordering book two as soon as I can.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This was a great purchase.  The video quality is awesome...most of the time.  There were a couple scenes I came across, usually scenes around dusk, when some things seemed a little fuzzy, but I only noticed that a few times.  The DTS audio is amazing, especially during the Bastogne episodes.  Definitely a great story, I saw it when it originally came out on HBO, and I loved it the second time through on Blu-Ray.  Great buy!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Just bought this for my wife. She has an Acura TL that plays DVD audio but we have never heard one before.  We saw Beatles Love in Vegas last August and my wife loved it.

0978607651|5.0|This is a pricey book, however, it is the ultimate compilation of the work of an amazing but underappreciated artist. The volume is massive, and browsing through these highly stylized images, one is transported into the artist's world, courtesy of Todd Oldham, who wisely chose a supersized horizontal format to showcase the art. Oldham has created a beautifully packaged and produced homage to Harper that will leave you breathless. Harper's shapes and color sense are magnificent and surprisingly subtle, his economy of line the epitome of modernism, yet there is a human appeal.<br />This is a treasure trove of inspiration for any visual artist.
B00129H7VS|4.0|Band of Brothers is a series that is tough to beat when it comes to drama, excitement, realism, cinematography, sound effects, etc.  This story and its characters really make an impact on the viewer - knowing this is historically accurate just amplifies that attachment.  The only negative thing I can say about this is that the video quality is not what I've come to expect from Blu-ray.  Don't get me wrong - this looks and sounds wonderful.  There is some improvement in video quality over standard DVD, but if you have access to one of the better up-scaling DVD players, you'll not notice too much difference.  The extra features are nice on the Blu-ray set (you need a Picture-in-picture capable player to take advantage of some of the extras).  All-in-all, I highly recommend this set to everyone.  But, if money is tight and/or you don't have access to a PIP Blu-ray player, you may be able to find this in standard DVD format without losing out on much at all for considerably less money...  If you can get the Blu-ray set on a good sale, don't even think twice about picking it up though.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Pixar has done it again, knocking the proverbial ball out of the park with WALL-E, a fun, funny, science fiction action romance with a big heap of message.  WALL-E, the main character, is a tiny trash robot.  You get the impression that he is the last functioning unit of his kind on Earth, and that the WALL-Es were left behind to clean up all the garbage while humanity took to the stars.<br />Enter EVE, the robot whose sudden appearance in WALL-E's life gives him a new hope:  companionship and love.  I don't want to give away the fun and clever plot that carries forward from there, but I will tell you that this film does an excellent job of keeping the child-level of the film action-packed for the boys and sentimental and sweet for the girls:  this was an excellent Valentine's Day movie for my family.  It also keeps the adults amused with the underlying social / environmental statement using periodic nods to \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\".<br /><br />The Blu-Ray disc is well worth the extra dough--details and colors in this movie are extremely clear and sharp, and various little things, from particle effects to light and focus, come across vividly on Blu-Ray.  This edition of the Blu-Ray adds a lot of fun, throwing in deleted scenes with and without commentary, some entertaining \\"arcade-style\\" games that take you back to the '80s (clear knock-offs of \\"Asteroids\\" and \\"Burgertime\\" can be found), behind-the-scenes, documentaries, and a digital copy of the movie that you can download.<br />Two cons to this disc:<br />1) BD-Live content apparently requires you create an online account, log in, etc....I didn't feel like doing that<br />2) The disc tries to implement \\"Disney Fast-Forward\\", a way of launching all the content in order, from Previews to the movie to launching bonus materials afterwards.  I found myself jumping out of that fairly quickly after it ran previews, then more previews, then commercials...you get the idea.  Bleah.<br />If you like science fiction and you're a fan of Pixar films, you'll find WALL-E enjoyable.  Moral messages can get obnoxious in films, but this one doesn't really conk you on the head with soapboxing, it instead takes a gentle poke at our society and culture similar to the jibes in Over the Hedge.ll find WALL-E enjoyable.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|Being an owner of [[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports (And The News)]] which is also a good album. But it was missing a few songs so this one does a great job filling the gaps. The liner notes have some neat pictures. I like the one with Huey sitting on the beach with the News in the sand up to their heads. Containing 21 tracks it's a well packed disc. Having a live version of Trouble in paradise is one of many songs making it worth the buy. There's nothing wrong with being (Hip to be square) when (Workin' for a livin') only to get a (Couple days off) on the weekends to do some (Crusin').
1846140064|4.0|As I was not aware of the Aid programs bias and problems. I always complied with the current and unique trend: \\"Send more Monies to Africa. It will solve all of their problems\\".  This book brought me a brand new look at the Aid system and to discover why it does not always work.    With Passion and Rigor Ms Moyo brings a lot of numbers and facts to the table. She also brings solutions and tools that may work in the future.    Sometimes, I was lost in numbers and redundant affirmations as some points are obvious from the beginning. I have to admit, I skipped some pages.    I learned a lot and this book allowed me to better understand the situation. Glad I read it
B001L5SXQG|4.0|Not my favorite disc from Bruce I have them all. But The Last Carnival is one of the greatest songs he has written,not far behind are Life itself and Good Eye, Great mature music for people whom understand a deep connection to lyrics and music. Worth the price for those 3 songs.
0571202284|5.0|Hands down one of the best animation books out there. It's a visual guide, history, and how to manual all rolled into one. I can't think of many books that deal with classical animation that feel as complete and authoritative as this book is.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|Billy's back, and this time, he's furthering the Pumpkin legacy's descent into irrelevance! Also, he brought the old drummer back. Unfortunately, he had the drum tracks written prior to assembling the remainder of the instrumentation, so what we get here is a bunch of awkward songs with a lot of grimace-inductive lyrics and a 10 minute marathon track I've only had it in me to sit through once. Like all SP records, there are a few decent moments and songs strewn around, but Zeitgeist has them limited to the point where the awfulness suffocates every sunspot the disc has to offer.   But hey! That's not the real kick. Why does this exist? What prompted Billy to pick up the Smashing Pumpkins moniker, regardless of what 3/5ths of the former band decided on? Listening to this, I can't help but wonder who this is directed towards. Are you telling me that fans survived through that abortion of an album, Machina II? Or is this just a treat for the fans(?) of Zwan?   The Smashing Pumpkins lost mainstream relevance a decade ago, and if this reinvigorates their fanbase, I can't say I have a retort to give.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The DVD came with plenty of time to spare and in perfect condition.  Thank you!
B000006TRV|5.0|I was just listening to the radio and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" came on.  To this day, I still get goosebumps everytime I hear this song.  It is timeless, like most of Pink Floyd songs.  Perhaps the best song ever written both musically and lyrically?  I guess time will tell....
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I don't know why Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is receiving so much praise, apart from the fact that it brings Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and Johnny Depp together again, as well as being based on the long-loved story by Roald Dahl and preceded by Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Because of this latter reason, it was guaranteed a certain amount of success and bound to draw fans of either the old movie or book, or both. Because of the former reason, it was also guaranteed a healthy measure of success and fans of either Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, Johnny Depp, or all three. I'll tell you why it doesn't deserve praise: Most of the time, it's just plain boring. It started off well, with sweet little Charlie and his family in their quaint, lopsided hut; they obviously suffer from indigence and Sickeningly Sweet Syndrome. Everyone is kind and loving and selfless and supportive of each other, etc. etc., and it's all quite corn-fed, but that's all fine and well; it can only be expected. Grandma Bucket with her \\"I love grapes\\" line was even funny and endearing. The movie begins to go downhill after the discoverer of the first Golden Ticket, that rotund German boy, is shown.    The plot is all too predictable. You knew from the start that Willy Wonka hated all the children and their parents except Charlie and Grandpa Bucket, and that the rest of the movie would consist in him knocking them off one by one, until only Charlie & Co. were left. That's all it was really about; the process of elimination. While we're on the subject of elimination, what did Willy Wonka get rid of that angry video game child for, being smart and making comments to which Wonka had no reply? Indeed, he made the only solid point of the movie in saying, \\"Why is everything here so pointless?\\" I know that it's a children's movie, but they could at least mix things up a bit so you don't find yourself reminded of preschool shows on TV, such as Dora the Explorer or Blues Clues, which feature cyclical journeys.    Speaking of young audiences, the movie was childish. Yes, yes, it's a children's movie, but it was childish even for a children's movie. I know that I found even Edward Scissorhands a bit childish, but I liked it anyway for its charms. And I like Tim Burton, don't get me wrong, but does he think everything a happy dark fairy tale? Nothing's ever that complex in his films; he relies more on visuals and a sort of magical atmosphere.    But this movie lacked that. I wasn't all that impressed by those in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I thought the seahorse-shaped boat they rode in down the chocolate river looked particularly fake; like cheap plastic, really. None of the scenery was spectacular. I didn't like how near the beginning, when they were introducing the four other children who found a Golden Ticket, their skin and features were so obviously computer-\\"enhanced\\" that they looked cartoonish. Not to nitpick.    A more major thing is that I didn't like the character of Willy Wonka himself, which is like a fatal stroke in the world of film. You have to like the main characters, or at least approve of them to some degree, to appreciate a movie, and Willy Wonka was just rude, hypocritically judgmental, lacking in depth and complexity (the whole \\"I have flashbacks of being traumatized by my father\\" thing didn't cut it), and - forgive me - dorky. Not quirky in a good way. I didn't even like the way he looked or that exceedingly silly haircut he had. He said nothing very interesting or that would make me take more kindly to him throughout the movie. None of the other characters were great/engaging or very well-played, either, including Charlie and Grandpa Bucket.    The Oompa Loompas' several songs celebrating the riddance of each child were annoying, seemed to be added simply to kill time, and only drew your notice more sharply to the cyclical, repetitive nature of the plot. I wanted them to shut their minuscule, identical noise tubes.    Last of all butnot least, it didn't leave me with a \\"warm, fuzzy feeling inside\\" as might be expected. There didn't seem to be any moral to it, except perhaps, \\"Candy doesn't need to have a point, and neither does this movie, apparently,\\" or, \\"If you're a poor, goody-goody child, all your dreams will come true because you'll get to inherit a chocolate factory full of magical goodies, not because of any talent or ambition but simply because you're the least spoiled of five randomly selected children who all like to eat chocolate.\\" There was no real bond between Wonka and Charlie, as might also be expected, and, like I said, there's nothing special or particularly warming about Willy Wonka. There's no \\"magic\\" to the movie as there is to other Burton films. It leaves you only dissatisfied and feeling very much like you have just seen it exactly for what it is, nothing more: nothing memorable. It has no heart or vivacity in it, and that is probably why, above all else, it falls flat.    That being said, I'm sure you'll have a lovely time watching it with your kid(s)/spouse/friend(s)/yourself, enjoying the pointlessness and vapidity that is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.    It's okay to watch. Really. Just don't expect anything special or heart-warming or graphically fabulous. I'm sure little kids won't even notice the difference. I felt impelled to write this heavily negative comment only because: 1) it's my actual opinion, and 2) I was seeing all positive comments about how delightful this little movie is.    3) It's not touching, heart-warming, or sincere, yet still very corny, and I demand to have my cold heart thawed and de-barbed by happy children's movies, I say!
0061684384|5.0|as an artist ive seen loads of other artists books, and this is by far the best!
B000068FUS|4.0|A true rock opera about Skynyrd.  I love the south, and it's great to hear them.  Well worth the buy, I just discovered them in the past few months and am wowed by their music.  Shut your mouth and get you A$$ on the plane is worth the cost alone.  Looking forward to their coming to DC again.
B0017APQ1K|5.0|If you've only seen this movie on regular DVD you should see it on Blu-Ray.  There is so much more detail it is like a different movie.  Way better.
0321544080|4.0|It has some good tips and great stories. I would say it's more heavy on philosophies than on actual photo how-to's. So this isn't the book for you if you're just starting out in photography. The tips are things like using gels in fluorescent lighting or put the reflector here. It's best for letting you in on how a successful real-world professional did/does things. Overall it was a good book.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|Ever since we sat down as a family and watched the first HSM, we were all collectively in love! This is a great idea, wonderful movie, extremely talented cast. My daughter and son have a hard time sitting down through the entire movie they just want to get up and dance!!! I recommend this for anyone with children, and just maybe, without!!
032147404X|5.0|This book teaches you how to achieve results you want without the theory behind the advice.  It does so in an entertaining way.  There were a number of bits of information in the book that I found made it more than worth what I paid.  For example, I had always wondered how photographers got such blue skies.  Now I know!  I wondered if there was a site on which to sell photos.  The book covers that.  Plus, the author shares his favorite cameras, tripods and printers.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This performance is simply amazing. His music grows on you more and more. I have been listening for a few months now and am still not tired of it. There are only two songs I really don't care for and I can't ever think of another album I thought that of let alone a live performance. His songs also sound better in this live performance than his CD's do. He adds a little more guitar flare, soul and character in this live performance. If you're a fan of talent, guitar, Mayer, acoustic rock or Blues you will really enjoy this album. I was pleasantly surprised myself and am now a huge fan. I will definitely catch his next concert tour. Buy it!
0385340540|4.0|I'm not really a huge fan of political or courtroom type dramas but I really enjoyed The Broker.<br />  There's plenty of excitement here thanks to top-notch attorney Joel Backman who gets his hands on the key to the single most sophisticated satellite network on the planet and tries to auction it off to the highest bidding world super power. (How would you like to have the Saudi, Chinese, Russian and Israeli governments gunning for you? I'd opt to hide in federal prison, too.)<br />  Upon introduction Joel Backman is an unlikely protagonist since he obviously got what he deserved when he was sent to the lock-up and you wonder how good the book will be if this is the main character. But as the story progresses you actually come to like him (his troubles begin to change him; I guess the threat of assassination, losing everything you have, a stint in the pen, sudden unexplained freedom, and being rushed into hiding in Europe by the CIA will do that). And as you become sympathetic to Backman and his hazardous situation you also get a glimpse of his temporary home, Italy, through his eyes. He comes to love it though he is more or less being held there against his will.<br />  Obviously, John Grisham fell completely in love with the cities, people, language and history of Italy when he went there to do research for his book. If the author's enthusiasm does kind of steal the show, just watching Backman make monkeys out of the best assassins in the world, not to mention the scheming CIA itself, makes up for it. The Broker is definitely worth reading.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Can't say enough about this, all I can tell you is words will not describe how much you will enjoy this DVD until you purchase it. If you've already seen or purchased on ITunes this is worthy of a duplicate copy, if only for the very first \\"singing\\" commentary you have ever heard. Great cast, great laughs and an all around great experience.  This is worthy of a sequel.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Renee has such a beautiful voice.  I love her song selections.  Her albums may not be the most commercially viable, but they comprise a wonderful catalog of music.  You just do not expect the little girl from the TV show Still Standing to have this powerful voice.  I own other albums by Renee Olstead and this is right in line with my past experience with her music - truly enjoyable. Definitely a must-have in my book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  I really like Band of Brothers on standard def, but the blu ray version is fantastic.  The action sequences and explosions are really crisp. You notice a lot of things you never noticed in the SD version.  I would definitely recommend to anyone with a Blu Ray player.
0385334176|5.0|Vonnegut's style is clever and engaging, and the material touchingly human. A very fast read; I could hardly put it down. I recommend this book to anyone looking for something entertaining and energetic but also thoughtful - very refreshing after being constantly bombarded by all that trash that's usually passed off as entertainment.
0380799006|5.0|This book has lots of very practical advice for reducing sibling rivalry.    1- Never, ever label your kids -- even if the label is positive.  Susie is the smart one and Jimmy is the social one.  This implies to kids that Jimmy is the dumb one and Susie doesn't know how to socialize, even if that isn't what you mean.  This is a real-life sibling situation described in the book.  In this case, Jimmy ended up dropping out of high school and Susie ended up not developing any real relationships until in her 30's.  Scary how influential parents are.    2- Never compare kids, even if it is positive.  Comparing kids leads to the kids resenting each other and usually taking it out physically on each other when the parents are not around.    3- Play-fighting (this happens a lot in my house) stops as soon as one person says \\"this isn't fun anymore\\".      4- And if I hear crying, instead of yelling \\"What did you do?\\"  I say, \\"I hear crying, do you need me to get involved or can you settle it yourselves?\\"  Contrary to what the authors say though, my kids usually want me to get invovled!    This is advice you can put into practice immediately and seems to be fairly effective.  And if nothing else, the book is worth reading just for the \\"I'm gonna get a second wife\\" story!  ;-)
0307387178|3.0|Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer is a powerful piece of literature about a young man, Christopher McCandless, who abandons his possessions and goes into the wilderness of both the Western United States and Alaska in 1992. He wanted an adventure in the wilderness even if it meant certain demise. The book retraces his steps by starting out describing his death and then it goes back to all the people that met him along his journey while sometimes going back further to when he was a young man. The book pieces together his motivation from when he started out to when he was found dead in an abandon bus in the Alcslean wilderness.  When Christopher is hitchhiking in Alaska, he gets picked up by a truck driver. They talk and Alex says he is exploring the Alaskan Wilderness and that he only has a ten pound rice bag for food and nearly no navigational equipment. The truck driver offers  to buy him some new gear, but McCandless refuses. While in the truck, Alex later revels that he hasn't spoken to his family in two years. Alex also reveals that he has a hatred for modern society. The truck driver drops him off in the wilderness and he has to fend for himself with nearly no navigational equipment and little food. Three months later, McCandless is found dead in a bus. The book later goes back to all the people he got in touch with along his journey.    The book pieces together its information from a journal that he kept and  letters he wrote to the people he met. I didn't enjoy this particular writing style because every chapter  would either discuss a different person or go back to his life when he was younger.  This seemed very disjointed; however, it did pull you in to the investigation of what happened.  Although it was interesting to hear how he touched people's lives and to hear their stories, I felt that it was just a bunch of short stories put together. I also didn't like how the book started out with his death. I would have liked it better if I figured that out later on in the book. Although it has some minor flaws, saying it was a bad book would be wrong. I enjoyed hearing about his travels hitchhiking around the country and how he ultimately makes it up to Alaska. I also enjoyed hearing about his life and why he gave up all his money, car, and other possessions to go out into the wild. The book is filled with adventure and excitement, and I recommend anyone to read this book. I will end with part of a letter Christopher sent to a man along his journey. \\"So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.\\" (56-57)
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a must own series, and to own it in Blu-Ray makes the experience even better. Highly recommended.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I always fan from Clin Eastwood Movies and here in Monterrey, Mexico is hard to find special editions , only under order and is always is the double priced. But  this is my first buy from amazon and recomended a lot, the time arrival estimated was by 1 month , and i receive my DVD in only 4 days , amazing ,specially from this seller, SO have the security of you receive your product any place in Mexico or Latin America.<br />Gracias.
B000003CMB|5.0|I recently listened to \\"At Fillmore East\\" for the first time in about ten years, after giving it a considerable break from my regular listening, and it still has the same effect on me as when I first heard at the age of 12. There is simply no live album of this genre and of this era that can compete, perfectly capturing two great nights at what is arguably the greatest rock venue of its era only months before its closing, and also capturing the interplay and honesty of a great rhythm band, only months before the tragic death of its greatest instrumentalist, Duane Allman.    I know all the songs on this album so well that I see no point in discussing them; a thousand listens has put the album in a space in my head where I listen for many small musical \\"moments\\" that resonate with honesty, and the energy of a group of young guys from Macon in full command of their inimitable sound.  Some of these moments include Allman's flawless slide playing on \\"Statesboro Blues\\"; Dickey Betts' hoedown duel with the two drummers in \\"You Don't Love Me\\"; the great crescendo (perfectly cut off) that ends \\"Hot 'Lanta\\"; and Duane's final, despairing solo over a pedal 'C' in the final minutes of \\"Whipping Post\\" that leaves the audience in stunned silence and still leaves me with tears in my eyes. These are only a few of many such \\"moments\\" you will find for yourself on this absolutely timeless classic -- easily the greatest southern rock album ever made.
0064410935|5.0|I have read a LOT of children's novels lately and this one is the best.   I don't say that lightly: I am a critical reviewer and frequently give two stars to \\"classics.\\"  But E.B. White's story about a caring spider and a young pig speaks about humanity as well as any other work of children's fiction.      Over the whole book hangs the terrible specter of Wilbur the pig's death.  In a remarkable plot shift, Charlotte the spider ends up dying.  Her death is surprising and beautiful.  We are humbled and emptied by this wonderful creature's passing.  But with Charlotte's end comes the ultimate lesson about death: while some die others are born, and they live a life partly assembled by the dead.  For a book to tell tiny children such things so well and so compassionately is a real feat.  E.B. White, who himself has died, has indeed left behind great life in his wake.
0375826726|1.0|Were do i start? With the storyline that drags on and on and on untill you could just die? Or maybe with the gory battle scenes which involve roran smashing peoples heads with a little to much detail? All in All, this was rediculously long and boring. About half way through the dwarf politics scene, I got so ore that i stopped reading it for months. then, I was very dissapointed with the horrible conclusoin, in which nothing really happens. In short, when things actually start to happen, It gets really gory, (mostly roran) and then in no time at all, the short battle is over, and guess what? More boring politic. The sword part is o.k., but in all, I really do not reccomend this book, unless you are having a hard time falling asleep. (It put me right to sleep)
B00005U122|5.0|I was at one of the concerts they filmed for this DVD, and I have to say being there was AMAZING, and this DVD comes pretty close to what I experienced. I love watching this and remembering seeing him live at this show. He was in top form, much better than his more recent dark side tour. If you like Pink Floyd, please do yourself a favor and buy this, you will not be disappointed.
B001DEXDNI|4.0|As a representative sample of Annie Lennox's musical career post Eurythmics, this collection is successful. As a collection of her best work, it is incomplete. Spanning her four independent albums of the last 17 years, it includes many of her radio hits, a few lesser known songs, and two new offerings \\"Pattern Of My Life\\" and \\"Shining Light.\\" It is definitely a good mix of her music, but it doesn't include a few of her absolute best tracks. However, as always, Annie still is an American pop icon, and one of a very few singers who have the right to the title \\"Diva.\\"<br /><br />Missing from this collection is her amazing \\"Into the West\\" from the Lord Of The Rings Soundtrack, certainly one of her best and most beloved singles. Strange, considering her other soundtrack hit \\"Love Song For A Vampire\\" made the cut. I would also have loved to see \\"Primitive\\" from DIVA, which is probably one of her most overlooked songs. With it's slower beat and melodic string accompaniment, it would had been great to see it get a reintroduced to those who might have missed it the first time around.<br /><br />I was happy to see the inclusion of some of her excellent tracks from BARE. \\"Pavement Cracks,\\" is a great song from that album, and I was afraid it would get overlooked for a lesser offering like \\"Honestly\\" or \\"Loneliness.\\"<br /><br />I would have also liked to see \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down,\\" from MEDUSA. A cover of Neil Young, it is another example of a great song that never made the pop charts, and would have benefited from a re-introduction.<br /><br />This is the perfect collection for the passive Annie Lennox fan who wants a solid collection of her more popular tracks. If you already own many of her CDs, there isn't much new material, so I would recommend downloading the two new tracks and not buying the entire CD. Annie is still an amazing vocalist, and this collection is a reminder of that fact.
B001KVAMM4|2.0|I heard the Piano Trio from this disc on the 103.7 the Mountain radio station and got totally excited and ordered it the same day. I was positively surprised to learn that both a CD and a 5.0 DTS DVD surround disc was included for just under $14. The Mendelsohn Violin concert is \\"OK\\" from a musical perspective, but not on par with several of Mutters past recording - especially compared to Beethovens Violin concert with Berliner Philarmonics under Karajan. However, it was truly entertainming to watch the DVD and listen to the DTS 5.0 surround recording while she was playing. The REAL DISAPPOINTMENT however was the sound quality of the Piano Trio. It is recorded in a smaller concert hall, and the sound is flat and indistinct to the point that I couldn't bear to listen to more than half of the first movement. Granted that I am a sound engineer by trade, but in my mind, it is unbelievable that Deutsche Grammofon would even consider putting their label on a disc with level of quality. I would return the disc if I could...
B00129H7VS|5.0|It was on the deal of the day for like $36.99 for blu-ray!! There is no reason you should not own this series it is great.  The only complaint I have is an unneeded sex scene near the end of the series, otherwise excellent.
2352500796|1.0|Having Volume 1, this volume is a major letdown. Where volume 1 took you through every aspect of combat equipment and what the troops had to wear and fight with, this volume picks up on...in the rear! The largest chapter is on US Army chaplains, followed a close second by WACs. I use the first volume as an invaluable guide in my business of producing military miniatures, and was eagerly awaiting the second volume. What an over-priced let-down, after the first. If you really need to know just what the Nylon Panties and Slips issued to and worn by WACs in WWII looked like, then by all means run out and plunk down your hard earned bucks. If you really need to know just what the Army troops were reading, or what types of beer and soda pop they were drinking in 1944, again, shell out the greenbacks. Otherwise, get volume one, read and savor it, and SKIP volume two, unless you just have to have both to complete your set. What a waste of time and effort. You've been warned!
0743298039|3.0|For me, this book started out strong.  I really liked the character of Margaret, the biographer, and I was interested in how the story of the twins was going to lead back to Vida.  However, I was really disappointed in the implausable, WTF?-type ending.  Even though I didn't mind it as much, I think many readers would be turned off by the incestous and violent relationship between the parents of the twins.  The author described Vida as an author of books so riveting you couldn't put them down.  I wish this had been one of them.
1595822003|5.0|Great classic story--Mary Shelley's teenage genius, unedited, alongside comic artist great Bernie Wrightson's illustrations--give it great atmosphere fitting the story. Highly recommend it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Being from Texas I thought the accents were a little much at first, but then realized that there ARE people in backwoods towns that talk like that. Also for most of the actors besides Arlene's character being foreign born, they did a pretty good job with the southern accents. After I got over that I was completely hooked by Sookie and Bill's sexual tension. The character spin offs were really entertaining even though after reading the books they were a little different. I have now read the books (Sookie Stackhouse Vampire Series) and The Twilight and I absolutely was so bored by the later. It was way to PG for someone who grew up reading Stephen King and other graphic authors. Allen Ball does a great job with this series and I am so happy that Charlaine Harris got a HBO TV series instead of a teenie-boper movie.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|thats the best film ever produced in 2008  it has both a spectacular thrilling story and a top  actors ( christian bale ) is one of the best actors in the world  at this moment, thought i cant forget the most interesting charachter  which is the joker.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is a really great movie, keeping on with the actual theme of the comics  not some ridiculous farce that had been made of it before.  Have watched it twice now and get more out of it eache time, there is so much going on.  Keep up with this form.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Twenty-two ABBA songs?  Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan?  A movie from a musical?  It actually works!  The story is simple.  Donna (mother Meryl Streep) was once a wild child and now, twenty years later has a daughter, Sophie who is getting married.  They run a rustic hotel on a tiny Greek island.  The trouble is, Sophie never knew who her father was and neither did Donna.  Sophie figures out it has to be one of three men, so she seceretly invites them while mother Donna invite her two best friends making a perfect excuse to team up three couples during a wedding.  That's it.  Really.<br /><br />Even if you loathe ABBA, you'll find some good humor and songs here amidst the clever (if forced) storyline.  The songs and dancing action are non-stop, although some of the choreograophy could have been improved.  The visuals are stunning and Greece never looked so good.  Sure, some of the songs are goofball and corny, but they  carry the story and for the two male members of ABBA (Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus) to have created such a monster hit is remarkable.  Yes, Meryl Streep really CAN sing as good as the rest of the cast, but Pierce Brosnan is horridly, inexplicably painful to listen to.  No matter.  It's a simple, light-hearted film with lots of good music and good feelings.  The ending is hilarious.  Its just a good time for all.<br /><br />Dolby Surround makes a great mix for the view.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and I thought it was very entertaining. Watching it again in Blu-ray format was amazing and it brought the movie closer to reality. The scenic view from the beach house were spectacular and breathtaking!
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Everytime I watch this film I wonder how it could happen.  I always end up angry at the system.  This is a Must have Paul Newman film.
B00013RC8O|4.0|It might `only' be a chase movie in terms of plot - but this movie reeks so much of the period in which it was made it is more like an historical record of a nations mood.  Barry Newman is an ex policeman and ex stock car racer, who now is reduced to delivering cars for a living.  In pushing himself to get the job done, he is forced to take speed, and has no time to sleep - he is a man falling between the cracks of society.  He accepts a bet that his latest delivery - a Dodge Challenger - can be delivered from Denver to California by a certain time.  While racing to meet his deadline the police take notice and a chase begins, commented on by a blind radio station dj, who helpfully provides an iconic 70's soundtrack to the proceedings.  Along the way he meets dropouts, hippies, drug dealers, Jesus-freaks and hold-outs against civilization.  In short, a synopsis of all those from the 60's generation who are disillusioned at the way the 70's are starting.  If it's aged in terms of the music and in places the style, It has not dated nearly as much as it's contemporary `Easy Rider', and the cinematography of the empty, grand spaces of Western United States makes the movie worth watching in itself.  The soundtrack is surprising in places, but the sound design itself is a star, with the growl from the Dodge Challenger part of the rush.  It's arguably the movie that defined chase movies for years to come - where would Smokey and the Bandit be without it? And yet few of its successors had the sense of astute and bleak observation of the times.  Thrilling, expansive, yet trimmed down and simple in plot, this is worth catching up on and deserves to find an audience again.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Besides the clarity of Blu-ray to depict the special effects in these movies, the special features include alternate beginnings and endings. A nice touch.
0930289234|5.0|Read the cover (Times Magazine Top 100, and written by Alan Moore) then read the book. Amazing. Seriously, amazing.
B001JL1V8E|5.0|Such a fun book. If you are a fan of Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and other Jane Austen books, you will love this modern twist. It's witty, sweet, romantic and a little suspenseful.  Which \\"Mr. Darcy\\" will Jane end up with? Don't skip to the end. Read each fun, delicious page to the delightful conclusion. A quick read that will make you fall in love.
B00005R2IS|3.0|\\"Mad Max\\" is the first of a trilogy, followed by \\"The Road Warrior\\" (1981) and \\"Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\\" (1985). Very few people in the States saw \\"Mad Max\\" when it was released in 1979 because it only had a limited run here. Most Americans were introduced to the dystopian world of Mad Max with the release of \\"The Road Warrior\\" a couple years later.<br /><br />THE STORY: Ambiguously set in the near future after some sort of Apocalypse or social-economic breakdown, \\"Mad Max\\" focuses on the desolate regions of Australia wherein the police force, called The Bronze, try to protect what remains of society from a wild outlaw bike gang.<br /><br />\\"Mad Max\\" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- it's weird, raw, primal, ugly, low-budget and shuns explanation. Star Mel Gibson was a complete unknown at this point.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS:<br /><br />-- Director George Miller is imaginative with his unusual use of camera angles. I usually don't take note of such things so it has to be exceptional for me to notice.<br />-- The costuming and locations are great, shot in the desolate areas of Victoria, Australia, including along the ocean shore.<br />-- Although a bit cartooney, the filmmakers and actors successfully capture the utterly wild, looney and lawless nature of the bike gang, sort of reminiscent of, say, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (1971) and \\"The Warriors (1979).<br />-- The girls are fetching in a girl-next-door type of way.<br />-- The scene where a mother and child are run over by the outlaw bikers is creative and memorable.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK:<br /><br />-- The film has a really dated, low-budget vibe, especially the horrible score. One might argue that this is natural since it's from the late 70s, but that's not what I'm talking about. A film can obviously be from a certain period without being dated in the negative sense. Take, for instance, \\"The Exorcist\\" (1973), \\"Jaws\\" (1975), \\"Suspiria\\" (1977), \\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979) and \\"The Warriors,\\" they're all plainly from that 70s era but they also transcend it. They're timeless films, pure and simple. Not so with \\"Mad Max.\\"<br />-- My main problem with the film is its aloof air. As noted above, the story shuns explanation -- which is great -- but it does it at the expense of truly captivating the audience. The film's only 95 minutes long but I always have a hard time sitting through it; the story is good but it's presented in such a way that it fails to truly pull the viewer in.<br />-- The vibe is often too over-the-top cartooney; I would have preferred a more realistic air. It's too obvious the filmmakers were shooting for an Australian \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"<br /><br />This is not a negative point to me but it may be to some viewers -- there's not nearly as much action as rumored; there are many long, dramatic parts. In addition, what action is there is good but it's no more spectacular than pretty much any other 70's road/car flick or TV series.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"Mad Max\\" is definitely worthwhile since it's the beginning of the popular trilogy and a definitive cult film, not to mention one of Mel Gibson's earliest performances. But, despite the many positives, don't expect to be blown away. It's decent but low-budget fare with a dated, aloof vibe.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: C+less films, pure and simple.

B00005V9HH|4.0|This story is a convoluted tale of evil that starts where a lot of modern evil does: in New York.<br />The five principle bad guys meet in a line up that was arranged by the boogey man, Kayser Soze.<br />We get a tale twice told by the fifth man, a cripple<br />which involves, lawyers, drug smugglers, Hungarians<br />and Argentines and most everyone dead on stage.<br />Who done it and why? What is the real story after you get all the lies?
1563898586|5.0|Alan Moore's LoEG, V1 is NOTHING like the movie, and that is a very good thing. Of course the same basic characters are there, but that is where the similarities stop. As my title suggests, this is another example of Alan Moore's ability as a writer and story teller. This volume, along with its sequel, are fantastic reads and are worth the money I paid for them. The story, dialogue, and art all fit together perfectly and there was never a moment I was not entertained. Perfect for any fan of Alan Moore or Graphic Novels in general.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|Ok this has been done before, maybe not with a hooker and a wretchedly skinny Christian Bale, but it's been done.  The movie was still good though predictable.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|If you saw \\"Tropic Thunder\\", you saw how some aging movie stars try desperately to stay in the limelight by remaking sequel after sequel of some past glory--like Sylvester Stallone does when he remakes all his 30-year-old hits. Or like Harrison Ford who desperately tried to jumpstart his stalled career last year by starring in a sequel to a hit movie--Indianna Jones--he made 30 years ago. Or Robert DiNiro who works in such potty-saturated comedies for imbeciles like \\"Meet the Fockers.\\"<br /><br />That's why was it was so exhilirating to watch a real master at work--Clint Eastwood--iwho hasn't sat back and tried desperately to remake his past glories. As he's gotten older, he's advanced to a stellar plateau where no other movie star has gone before.<br /><br />In \\"Gran Torino\\", he gives his swansong performance as a crusty old racist who discovers something noble in his psyche when needed in a time of danger. No other major male star has ever done this before. They've either (but rarely) retired after their glory days are over with. Or, as mentioned previously, they embarass everyone by refusing to mature and insist on remaking an old box office hit of decades gone by.<br /><br />Eastwood wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of a complex, but basically decent, old man who just wants to spend his last days drinking his beer and thinking of his recently deceased wife. But when trouble comes to his door step, he valiantly reacts and defends not only himself, but his once hated Asian neighbors next door.<br /><br />The only other male star who can compete with Eastwood in terms of brilliant film work--in front and behind the camera--is Mel Gibson. I hope that Gibson will have a phenomenal career like Eastwood. Eastwood proves once an for all you don't have to be a sizzling hunk or a male star in his prime to be a bona fide movie hero.  At the age of 80, he can look back on a career that will never be surpassed. Bravo to Clint Eastwood!
0451163516|3.0|Thankfully we have a nearer to contemporary novel to compare this one to:[[ASIN:0141441585 The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale (Penguin Classics)]]<br />by Joseph Conrad. The police were more of an after the fact bunch than a proactive on top of the job bunch in this novel.<br />International trading of the sort in this treaty was more behind very closed doors?<br />The novel makes a very good one of bringing in the Irish, women's rights<br />besides the European anarchists.<br />The result is pretty much an after the fact / hind sight sort of novel<br />that is an historical romance.<br />The connection of the British Royals with the Russians<br />seems to have more made on it than<br />historically was the case?
1401216676|3.0|Batman: The Killing Joke was a good read, but it was not the \\"amazing\\" story I expected. With the statement by Tim Burton on the cover and the fact that it was written by Alan Moore (who they say in the afterword was really not that into it), I expected this graphic novel to be mind blowing. However, the book lacked a certain \\"pop\\" that is often found in Batman/Joker episodes. It was definately worth reading but borrow it from the library.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I have watched this movie five times. It tells a very good story and the actors realy perform to their best. This is a movie to see at least once and any one can watch it, no matter wat their sexuality.    Watching the story unfold makes you think about what someone might actually go through in that situation, the family, friends and loved ones. It also reminds you that you have to take a leap at what you know in your heart you believe to be right.    This movie wil not dissapoint and it seems to have a very large following. Enjoy!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|well worth the $5 every ps3 owner should have a set for all there controlers!!!  i do!
B000PAAJYW|3.0|While I can admire the technical prowess of Anderson in making this film, there were too many unbelievable story elements, too much cussing, and just too much depravity that it overwhelmed my delicate conscience.<br /><br />Regarding the unbelievable elements, it wasn't the frogs or the characters breaking into song that put me off. Rather, it was the implausibility of Tom Cruise's character (Frank Mackie) and his misogynistic message, the quiz show's freakishly long run (30 years plus!?), the fact that everyone remembered a whiz kid (Donny), and other such mundane things. I know these weren't major plot points and were rather just simple vehicles to drive the story, their collective implausibility kept interrupting my suspension of disbelief and prevented me from fully buying into Anderson's world.<br /><br />And the cussing! I know some of you have no problem with it, but it was excessive. Maybe I've just prematurely aged, but when i hear so much vulgarity I just lose interest in the characters and feel the writer is just being lazy.<br /><br />Some will say, \\"Well, that's how people talk.\\" Maybe, maybe not. I don't care to hang around people who curse every other word either. It just degrades the whole thing in my opinion.<br /><br />Finally, while I have no doubt that  father's betrayal of his family responsibilities is extremely damaging, I don't like to wallow in it's effects for so long. Some may find cathartic release, but after a time, it just wears me out. Plus, it's a theme that has been explored ad nauseum in movies and TV and I don't know if Magnolia had anything fresh to say about it.<br /><br />In the end, the movie seemed like an indulgent exercise in artistic and psychological narcissism. I like some of Anderson's work, but he should apply his skills to more varied themes. Plus, I think he just needs a hug, maybe from the cop in Magnolia?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great set of DVDs. Videography is really great, imagery is beautiful. Get this DVD for an awesome survey of spectacular life and regions all over the planet.    Don't get this for the scientific content, though. You won't learn much. There is very little explanation of why things happen. The creators choose to show and describe interesting phenomenon and leave it at that.
0316017922|5.0|This book is in my top five of all time.  Great book with loads of research to backup data.  Written in a very entertaining way.
0385333846|4.0|Written in 1969, Slaughter House Five tells the story of an ex-World War II soldier, Billy Pilgrim, who is going mad due to what he saw and felt in World War II and then what is compounded by surviving a plane crash years later.  Vonnegut tells the story through a unique method of forward and backward chronology - time warps.  The manner of story telling is unique and has its share of humor; both black and laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim is shunted through his war years, with divergent moves to the science fiction world of Tralfamadore where he spends time in a zoo as the specimen.  Other traumatic times of his life unfold through the time warps giving background and filling in the gaps.  Billy is so shocked by the bombing of Dresden that it stays with him until he survives the plane crash.  At this point, everything comes \\"unstuck\\" and to compensate for these horrendous events, he finds peace in his science fiction world.  But the story is not all whacky fun and games.  Vonnegut is brutal in his portrayal of WWII and the final train ride for many of the Allied prisoners of war after the Battle of the Bulge and their movement to internment camps.  His use of black humor to tell this story shows how much it bothered him and how much of it remained with him.<br /><br />Vonnegut uses techniques that I've never seen to tell such an original story in a way never done that it has to be taken as a masterpiece regardless as to whether you like the style or not.  I admire the genius behind the story telling.  The pictures and images painted will last a while.
B0002YCVXI|4.0|I can't believe how much I like this rendition of The Ecstasy of Gold. And Dinner, Malena, Marco Polo, Nocturne,... Oh what the heck, the entire album is beautiful. Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone certainly rate higher than 5. However, there are clumsy transitions between some tracks. That's why I rated the CD a 4.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|\\"Tess\\" is that rare film that transcends into an emotional journey that defines a masterpiece. This film is studied in film schools around the world because it's many artistic elements all come together...great acting, beautifully photographed scenes, music score and actress Nastassja Kinski in the title role! Don't miss it!
0399241957|5.0|I saw this book in a dentist's office once. My sister's baby had a birthday coming up and I thought it would be a great little picture book for her to have (I am a bit of a monkey freak so it was a perfect gift from me). I would recommend this book to anyone with a young child.
1439130833|5.0|Since I received The Secret Daily Teaching as a Christmas gift, I have read it everyday. First I re-read the passage from the day before and then the current passage. It is a great way to start the day with a positive message to draw the things to you that you want in your life. I have shared the readings with others and think of it as a wonderful gift to give.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It has been awhile since I've been so completely absorbed with a book from page one. I'm reading this on my Kindle, and for the first time since I purchased it, the Kindle does truly \\"disappear\\" while I'm reading- I attribute that to the mesmerizing story by Lisa Genova.     I find the novel to be both an incredibly smart and beautifully written portrayal of an incredibly life changing experience. Quite simply, I cannot put down the book!    I am at the point where I am rationing my reading time to delay the end of the novel. I would highly recommend this book to all.
0439023483|5.0|I'm not sure where I first heard of this book but I decided it might be worth the read.  I'm glad I bought it.    The story is one that rarely appeals to me.  It has a sort of sci-fi/fantasy feel to it but the writing was what drew me in.  The main character is so believable and memorable.    You can see her change throughout the story and you really understand where she is coming from.  If you have ever read Twilight and thought it was a good book but too wordy and Bella was a little too vulnerable, then you'll love this book.    Katniss is the heroine that people can look up to.  She isn't vulnerable.  On the contrary, she is quite able to defend herself without anyone's help.  It was refreshing for me to have a character that wasn't always needing other people i.e. Harry Potter, Bella.    While the characters are great, the writing is smooth and elegant.  Collins does a wonderful job of making the story believable.  She adds little nuances to the story that make you believe this could actually happen.  At one point she describes hunting.  In it she tells us that Katniss always kills her squirrels with a shot through the eyes.  That information isn't necessary to the story but it makes the whole thing more believable.    The book is fast-paced and full of wonderful plot nuances.  The story isn't just an allegory for the future.  It also is a great survival story similar to \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\"  it has adventure and even a little love triangle.  The story will play with your emotions and leave you ultimately satisfied and anxious for the next addition to the series.
0920668372|5.0|This is such a great book to read to your boy (or girl) over and over.  My sister bought it for me when I had baby boys and I bought this copy for a friend who just had a baby boy.  I would read this to my boys and actually sing the part that of the story that could be interpreted as a singing phrase.  My boys still remember that to this day.  They are in high school and college now.  Very touching story.
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|Excellent work. Gets better with each listen. Lush and beautiful melodies abound as we'd expect from John. The instruments and choral vocals are brilliant. Was wishing for a little more rock and roll guitar, but this album's more holistic in its musical approach. The guitar adds texture to these beautiful songs.     John's vocal range is much improved and very expressive. There's still that guttural cry of his every now and again; imperfect but highly expressive. Delicate falsetto brings the best out of the melodies.    Not many if any radio friendly tracks under 4 minutes or whatever, which makes this release all the more worth buying. An excellent record for fans of music.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Since Hollywood Moguls decided that the moviegoing public don't want westerns any more it's great when one does come along but even greater when it's a quality western \\"like they used to make\\".  Appaloosa is one such movie. Ed Harris admitted they had a miniscule budget to work from...it certainly does'nt show. The location,sets, and lighting. The nuances between the main characters called for minimal dialogue and it works perfectly. Ed Harris's direction is excellent and the cast he assembled put everything into their roles to make this movie work. Also a very unexpected surprise to find Renee Zelwegger in an oater,but she is definately not out of place.  A movie worthy of much greater exposure.  If you love your westerns...this one is for you
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've watched this show on HBO, on the History Channel, and with others copies of the DVD's.  When the chance came to buy it on Amazon for cheap, I had to take it, thought I've already seen each episode many times.  The only disappointing thing about this was that I wasn't blown away by the Blu-ray quality, though after watching the Dark Knight on Blu-ray, maybe that wasn't a fair comparison.  For Amazon's price, don't think twice however.  Even if it was only standard definition, this is a must have.
B00005JNQA|5.0|this particular movie holds some sentimental value for me.  I saw this movie in the theatres, taking a girl I had just recently met on our first date.  Fast forward four years and we're still in an amazing relationship.  Bought her this movie for Valentine's Day, and even though we'll never watch it, it still means a lot to both of us.
B000001FV1|5.0|I already have this on album, but on the cd they seemed to have improve on the quality of the original recording I am a big fan of the Traffic so I do like most of their music, this cd is a good one for the collection.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this CD.  Even though she's young, Adele sounds like she's been singing forever.  Her voice is unique and her range is impressive.  The songs range from bluesy to jazzy to soulful.  The first time I saw her sing on television, it stopped me in my tracks.  Some voices have the power to touch your heart.  Adele's is one of those voices.  Her version of \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is particularly lovely.  This CD will make you smile and cry.
6303201997|4.0|Trying to capture the clever humor from the previous film, Shatner only manages to turn Spock, Bones and Kirk into The 3 Stooges of the federation.<br /><br />Without a clearly defined threat for the first hour of the film, the plot and any attempts at creating drama are meaningless. We are introduced to the \\"villain\\" in the first 3 minutes of the film, but he never commits any acts of evil other than commandeering the Enterprise and finally revealing his not at all evil plan near the end of the film.  Meanwhile a pathetic Klingon crew hovers around as a possible back-up threat, never delivering and being turned into a sad joke by film's end.<br /><br />Usually the Enterprise crew themselves can save the day entertainment wise, but under Shatner's hand they all become slapstick buffoons throwing out the occasional one-liner.  The only enjoyable scene is when Spock and Bones are made to confront their fears so there is at least a tiny glimmer of character development in the film.<br /><br />Definitely a chapter in the Star Trek mythos to be skipped.  It should be noted that the Amazon rating system will not let me choose anything lower than 4 stars, my actual rating would be 2 stars.
B000077VOY|5.0|Supermarionation tv is great stuff! I love this series! I used to watch this when I was a kid. It is so nice to be able to see it 40 years later.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Being a singer/ songwriter often leads to less than great vocals and over-the-top lyrics.  Not \\"Little Voice\\".  Sara Bareilles does a phenomanal job in providing a great mix of up beat and slower music.  Definitely a CD than can be listened to all the way through.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I had heard great things about Dr. Horrible, but had never had the patience to sit down and watch it on the internet. I was excited to see it come out on dvd.  What a twisted, unpredictable, and seriously fun show! The entire show is only about 40 minutes, but the dvd is worth every penny!  Also has a couple extras on the dvd, but I haven't had time to watch them yet.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|I am a 50-something woman who read this series after hearing wonderful reviews on NPR.  LOVED the first three books - great characters, wonderful plot twists, couldn't wait to see what happened.    Book 4 -   What happened to the plot twists?  The angst?  the anguish??  EVERYONE has a happy ending?  IN FORKS?
0307269752|4.0|Lisbeth Salander, a strange but darkly talented young woman and Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist with a vendetta, team up to solve a decades old mystery that leads to the unearthing of a serial killer.  There is also a broader story with Blomkvist working to restore his credibilty after being convicted of libel against a corrupt industrialist. This book was very satisfying in that the characters were well drawn and unusual.  The political views of the author and his unusual area of expertise provide a smart framework for the story that make it extremely compelling.
0618918248|1.0|The atheist on a mission - (and not accomplished)<br /><br />After reading a few other books on religion, I was really looking forward to read Dawkins. From an ethologist and biologist I would have expected a sound and logic reasoning based on evidence of why humankind is deluded into believing the existence of god and why there is no culture that can seem to live without religion.<br /><br />What a disappointment!<br />After endlessly quoting the nut cases of creationism and extremes of American Christian fundamentalists (and a few Muslim and Jewish ones), the question of WHY we are deluded is not answered. Most of the anecdotes we have heard before. Of course, among the many there are quite a few interesting ones, funny ones, and, as they were extreme choices, also frightening ones.<br /><br />But what about the middle road, where presumably most believers would associate themselves with? What about moderate religions, such as Buddhism (who have no missionary zeal) or the Bahai? There is no exploration of religions held in other cultures (which Christians in the past have derogatorily labeled as animism), maybe indigenous ones? Maybe one could find the answers there? Much of anthropology tries to find answers in indigenous or traditional societies to modern questions of society. The three major religions of the Fertile Crescent have undergone so many changes; have been misused for politics so much that it is very easy to pick their extreme or ultraorthodox manifestations to go on a \\"crusade\\" against religion.<br /><br />There is some speculation in the book that a cause for religion would be that the evolutionary benefit of children trusting their parents: \\"This snake is poisonous!\\" causes the undesirable byproduct that children would also believe: \\"God created the world\\". But this argument calls for the application of the same question that RD poses to prove that creationism does not make sense: If there was an intelligent designer: who designed the designer? Apply this question to the children's trust issue, and the speculation seizes to be a plausible one.<br /><br />So, RD gives no answer to my question.<br /><br />When I was passing though Germany the other day, I saw that this book was awarded the science book of the year! That is even more shocking than RD failing to provide an answer to my question (after all, it is a difficult one to answer).<br />To be fair, RD is not choosing the awards he receives for himself, but I still find this rather shocking. If this kind of book is considered scientific, then theology is a science too (which RD seems to suggests, it is not).<br /><br />To consider a book, even in a popular sense, scientific, it should meet some criteria: It should present a hypothesis, it should describe a methodology, should present facts in support of the hypothesis (leaving Popper aside for a moment) as well as those that would falsify it and it should be honest in its approach.<br /><br />I think RD failed on a few of the above:<br />Towards the end of the book RD uses the Amish as yet another example of the damage religion does to children by depriving them of a state education. RD omits to tell that in Amish and Mennonite societies, children are actually not baptized until they are around 18, hence capable of making a decision of whether to join the church or not. Some 20 to 30 percent decide not to get baptized. A pretty high number for kids who are \\"indoctrinated\\", I find.<br /><br />This could also have led to a related question which is why do humans tend to prefer the irrational in other areas than religion (and why do they seem to be able to distinguish between the much belaboured unicorn and religion)? A lot of such irrational causes appear later in life and are still being believed and do not require the manipulation of an infant mind. This is where I think the methodology falls short. It looks at religion as a case of irrationality (touching briefly on patriotism) without looking at other irrational choices humans make.<br /><br />Alan Greenspan did believe the bubble would not burst. Mugabe believes he can stay in power forever. Pol Pot believed in the purity of primitive rural life. Hitler (and Henry Ford) believed in the Jewish - Bolshevik world conspiracy. And all these people found millions who believed their irrational nonsense and followed them and acted accordingly! All of this created many more millions of deaths than religion has ever caused in the last hundred years (the deaths of the current economic crises will not be easily counted, but could go into the hundreds of millions).<br /><br />This is the question Mr. Dawkins fails to answer! Where is the \\"Delusion\\" gene (or its expression)? What evolutionary benefit do humans have from being deluded?<br /><br />Picking religion is too cheap, I find - especially if the \\"other side\\" is not even allowed to be heard. Just to avoid misunderstandings, with the the other side here I do not mean creationism, but the benefits of irrational behaviour, or in this case of religion: who would know St. Giminiano without its many churches? How many wars were not fought because resources went into building West Minster Cathedral, the Hagia Sophia or Tenochtitlan? (All are income genertating tourist attractinos). What motivated Albert Schweitzer to go to Lambar&eacute;n&eacute; and the Calvinist Henry Dumant to go to Solferino and found the Red Cross? The anecdotal mention that atheists are also displaying ethical behaviour is a necessary but not a sufficient argument against religion or for atheism. To make the point, one would really have to establish whether altruism is genetically inherent and evolutionary beneficial. I understand the debate on this one is still open.<br /><br />So all I can conclude is that Richard Dawkins is on a mission - a mission to increase the number of atheists. An entertaining oxymoron.  I find it hypocritical of a scientist to emphasize the scientific method to increase credibility while failing to actually apply sound scientific principles in making his case.<br /><br />Mission not accomplished.
B00008BXJG|4.0|This is my first AC/DC cd and it is really good! My favorite songs are Highway to Hell, and If You Want Blood (You Got It) If you love AC/DC, then you'll love want to take the HIGHWAY TO HELL!!!
B00005ONMJ|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous recording. Furtwangler is at his prime, and so is the cast. Marvelous decors and stage design as well. Every time I get to the ghost scene at the end I cry. I and I always will. Don't buy just one of this, buy a few, for the kids and the grandkids. You can't go wrong.
B000O77SRC|4.0|This is a really awesome movie with great action, and great actors! Some terrorists have taken control of Nakatomi Plaza and only one man can stop them; John McClane! He's a loose cannon cop that doesn't play by the rules! Can John kill the bad guys, save his wife, and make it out alive to celebrate Christmas? I highly recommend DIE HARD!!!

B000GFLE86|5.0|\\"Half the Perfect World\\" is more than half perfect, in fact each song seems to flow beautifully into the next throughout the collection.  Not a wrong note is hit here in terms of both the selection and the execution of the material.  I can't wait for her next disk!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Just got this a few weeks ago. The wife and I spent the next few nights in front of the tv and we could not stop.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|So after Madonna's amazing album \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" I really had high expectations for this album. Was I dissapointed? Well, some songs were actually pretty good, while others lacked the style Madonna seemed to emphasis in this album, like the songs were not so \\"sweet.\\" Well I'm going to break down my review by each song!<br /><br />1.) Candy Shop- 9/10<br />I heard this funky song when it leaked online for the first time, and I was like what is this? I really didn't think it would make it in the album! but after awhile the song gets a lot better, and the song for some reason makes me have a picture of her in a candy store! Nevertheless, the song is kind of fun, and even made it Rolling Stone's top 100 songs of 2008!<br /><br />2.) 4 Minutes- 9/10<br />I like this song, but it is very different song, and really sticks out from the rest of the 2008 songs. I like the song because it Madonna does a good job singing with Justin and Timberland (the should do more songs), but the only disappointing thing is the music video! But that won't effect the review lol :)!<br /><br />3.) Give it 2 Me- 9.5/10<br />This is the best song out of the album! Its message is true, and it's a really fun song to dance to! The only strange thing about this song is you either love it or hate it! Like i really like it and so does my sister, but when my friends hear it, they hate the song like no tomorrow! The only thing that I don't like about the song is the \\"get stupid\\" part but everything else is pretty awesome!<br /><br />4.) Heartbeat- 9/10<br />I think this song has a really good beat, and is a tuned down sexy song! It's just a fun song to listen to!<br /><br />5.) Miles Away- 9/10<br />This song is very mellow. It is not the usual happy, dance track by Madonna, but it's pretty good! I like the message of this song as well! But I really enjoy the remix a little more, bc it has a faster beat!<br /><br />6.) She's Not Me- 9/10<br />This song is so crazy! I just love how Madonna puts so much attitude in this song! It does kinda sound a little wacky, but it still is good.<br /><br />7.) Incredible- 6/10<br />NOT an incredible song. It really is not impressive, especially since most of her other songs from this album are better. I just don't like how it flows, since her singing really doesn't mesh with the background. Like the random scribbling sound, which is quite annoying.<br /><br />8.) Beat Goes On- 9/10<br />I am so glad she released THIS version, because she had a previous demo version, and it really was bad. I think this version is a fun and true song! and Kanye does a good job in this song too!<br /><br />9.) Dance 2night- 9/10<br />I think this song is like the \\"secret gem\\" of the album. It was never sung live by Madonna and probably won't become a single, but is a pretty good song. The beat is awesome, and her voice and Justin's sound so sexy together! Don't miss out on this song!<br /><br />10.) Spanish Lesson- 6.5/10<br />I really can only say blah about this song. She shouldn't have mixed the song with Spanish, because it really doesn't go well. I mean some parts of the song I like, but most of it is kind of messy.<br /><br />11.) Devil Wouldn't Recognize You- 9/10<br />This song is very beautifully written. She is very mature and serious in this song, and sings it in a very solemn way. I really like the background music too, especially the thunder part!<br /><br />12.) Voices- 7/10<br />Not a bad song, but it's like the song that you really won't listen to, especially with better songs on the album. It's worth listening to though and seeing if you like it!<br /><br />----Overall I love how Madonna always has a new style for each of her albums, trying to keep her music \\"fresh\\" which I think she did. I just feel that this time she didn't make it appeal to every music listener which is why many didn't like it! I personally liked most of the songs, especially GIVE IT 2 ME!! Don't miss out on this album!----y, but it still is good.    7.) Incredible- 6/10  NOT an incredible song.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Since some years now, Clint can do no wrong. Here he picks up a 'true' story, that could have been taken out of Kafka's story book, of course stretched and transposed to LA, and postponed by some years.<br /><br />A single mother's 9 y old son disappears. After some months the police force a changeling on her. Her protests (this is not my son) lead to her being locked up in a mental ward, where every step she takes proves that she is insane.<br /><br />This is a strange world. The police has units roam the streets with guns, shooting to kill rather than make captives; not fighting crime, but the competition. The police can lock up people at will. Disagreeing with the police proves insanity. A crude form of a premature Catch 22.<br /><br />But all is not lost, there are media who support the underdog and fight injustice. The legal system is still able to distinguish right from wrong. The closing note of the story is 'hope'.<br /><br />And let me put in a word for Ms.Jolie. I have read reviews which say that she 'overacts'. Frankly speaking, that sounds to me like the verdict of the shrink who thinks the sheer fact that she disagrees with the police in the question whether the boy is her son proves that she is nuts. How can you not over-act in such a situation? Every understatement would be a lie! I think, in case that she gets the Oscar, she deserves it. (I don't think she will, though.)

0440229081|5.0|I recently reviewed another book, [[ASIN:0786883243 The Reading Group Handbook: Everything You Need to Know to Start Your Own Book Club]], written by Rachel W. Jacobsohn. One way to read a book is to look for design, \\"an interweaving of theme, images, symbols\\" (131) which work together to create a superb symphony of words and ideas in story form.<br /><br />\\"Skellig\\" is most definitely like that. Every character, every line, every nuance are part of a totality, a symphony, if you will, of great depth, of transcendent mysticism. The word \\"skellig\\" is an Irish word which means rock and is the name of one of the most famous monasteries in the world: Skellig Michael off the coast of Kerry, Ireland. It was renowned in the medieval period because of its rugged, stormy living conditions and the endurance of its monks.<br /><br />The poetry, the mysticism of William Blake are part of the story. Looking for angels. Feeling shoulder blades for wings. Bird bones. Evolution. A very sick baby that may or may not live. The being who lives in a sustained state behind the tea chests and other junk in the garage, who may or may not be an angel. Or a bird.<br /><br />Michael and his parents and their very sick baby move into a house that needs much work. In exploring, Michael finds the being whose name is Skellig. He eats bugs and small animals and Chinese take-out. He is beautiful. Michael meets a girl, a year younger, who is home-schooled and reads Blake and draws birds. Her name is Mina (Wilhemina=William). She teaches Michael how to listen deeply to the sounds of baby birds in their nests. He teaches her how to blow owl sounds using his hands. Together they form a wondrous bond with Skellig.<br /><br />If I have conveyed just a hint of the wonder and magic of this incredible novel, then I have succeeded. What David Almond recreated in this *Honor novel is that openness of our child-like state to things beyond the mundane, the earth-bound, to magic and mysticism and otherworldliness where angels may leap to earth and its bindedness to tend to matters.<br /><br />*Note: \\"Skellig\\" was named an honor book by the Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature in 2000, when [[ASIN:0064407314 Monster]]) by Walter Dean Meyers won the medal.th and its bindedness to tend to matters.      *Note: \\"Skellig\\" was named an honor book by the Michael L.

B000007R1M|3.0|This was called a historically important mark in the historic electronic acts career; a warming up of the cold, sleek sound they virtually pioneered into something a little more accessible and willingly receptive to human interaction. Like many Kraftwerk releases 30 plus years after the fact, much can be divided into two separate categories- those tracks where the rigidly methodical productions transcend and those that do not.
1572815612|5.0|My 25-year old Rider Waite deck which I was given by the friend who introduced me to tarot was ruined in a basement flood, and so I needed to purchase a new deck.  I was going to purchase the same deck I already owned, but after some searching on Amazon I was attracted by the magnificent artwork in this deck, which is similar, but not so stark, as on the original Rider Waite deck.<br /><br />These are beautiful cards and I am enjoying using them. I only do readings for my own use (not for others -- so I am very much an amateur).  But I think that this deck would be very nice for a traditionalist who might like to try a new look, but still wants all the same features he/she is used to in the Rider Waite artwork.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The sign of any truly engaging piece of entertainment -- and I firmly believe Band of Brother to transcend such a label -- is an overwhelming sadness as the credits roll. Expound tenfold upon such an emotion, and that's what the entire final episode is like; you've grown to enjoy the characters so intensely that simply the knowledge of this miniseries' end is heartbreaking.    Now... remember that these aren't 'characters' -- they are actual people.    This isn't pure fantasy -- it's a recreation of actual events.    Band of Brothers is so eloquently presented, so dynamically directed and produced, that I cannot watch this without feeling displaced. Every aspect of this series is crafted painstakingly,  from the casting choices to the actors' performances to the glimpses of \\"things you've always heard about\\" to sets and locations which completely immerse you in the storylines; this is a must-have for anybody interested in war movies, WWII, history... or just plain ol' good drama. Feel free to keep a copy of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down nearby, in case you get inspired.  ;o)    The only drawback? It comes in a nice metal case... and mine was dented during delivery, without option for an exchange. In retrospect, I should've done the \\"buy it at a store and return the damaged copy\\" shenanigan, but a pair of pliers and my case went from 'damaged' to 'with personality'. Woot.    -EMM-

045122499X|4.0|Based on the negative reviews of this book I must be an immature simpleton for having enjoyed it...oh, and I'm a pervert and an atheist too.       I bought WWE purely based on my enjoyment of POTE.  Luckily, I didn't read the negative reviews until I had read 3/4 of the book, and while I recognize the elements that displeased the negative reviewers I think it was a gross exaggeration to say that the entire story was a huge disappointment.      Several have expressed dissatisfaction with inappropriate character behavior for the time period,  the amount of sex, and portrayal of the church.  Here are my thoughts on those negative reviews:    It has been entirely too long since I read POTE to make a thorough side-by-side comparison to WWE, but I'm sure if I were to go back and read it I would find 20th century \\"sensibilities pushed onto characters\\" in POTE just as they were in WWE.  As a matter of fact I just went back to the POTE listing on Amazon and found the editorial review from Library Journal states: \\"...much of the language as well as the psychology of the characters and their relationships remains firmly rooted in the 20th century. This will appeal more to lovers of exciting adventure stories than true devotees of historical fiction.\\"  So if you didn't figure it out the first time, don't gripe about it after reading another 1,000 pages with 20th/21st century sensibilities woven into a 14th century setting.  Clearly Ken Follett has figured out how to appeal to a 21st century audience and it worked for me.  I still consider it historical fiction....good historical fiction.    The sexual episodes are, in fact, fairly frequent and only occasionally add real value to the story.  Reviewers have criticized them for being juvenile and uninspiring, and I have to say...yeah...somewhat.  On the other hand, I suppose if Ken Follett had dwelled on them a bit longer and mastered the art of erotica he would have been equally criticized for going into too much detail and adding another 50 pages to the length of the book.  So if you are really offended by the passages with sex...don't despair...they are short enough to skip over quickly.    Much of WWE deals with primitive medicine and a town's struggle to become independent of the priory, and consequently deals with the church's authority.  The church has evolved drastically over the centuries, however, and those offended reviewers who compared the benevolent institution it is now with what it was in the 14th century are simply being unrealistic.  The church sought its own advancement through power and influence back then and corruption was an inherent part of politics...just as it still is today in many places.  Science was long considered witchcraft quite simply because we were ignorant and the church was generally intolerant of anything that contradicted its teachings.  Let's not forget how easy it was to be accused of witchcraft and heresy, and how often it really was used as a convenient method of eliminating one's rivals.    Overall I thoroughly enjoyed WWE.  The plot twists were classic Follett.  It captivated me as much as I remember being captivated by POTE, but I will admit that a couple of the issues I mentioned above could have been treated differently.

I thought we had it on VHS but I could not find it so maybe we watched it on TV all those years. So we bought the DVD to keep up the Family Tradition. The DVD is much better than TV or VHS, so we are quite happy with the DVD. Oh yeah, it's better in black and white. It was delivered when Amazon said it would be.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|Right from it's opening track New York, New York, Gold grabs you and never lets you go with some of the best songs I've listened to in a long time. Firecracker, Answering Bell, When Stars Go Blue, Somehow Someday are just a handful of the gems you'll find on Gold. For some reason still relatively unknown in these parts, Ryan Adams may be the best contempory American musician/songwriter since Bob Dylan. And although for some strange reason too long for some Amazon.com critic's, throw Gold in, kickback, relax and enjoy!

0783117523|5.0|I had never heard about this movie until I caught the last hour of it on tv. one Saturday evening late.  I had missed alot of it and the ending got cut off due to time and I knew I had to see the entire movie, so I ordered it from Amazon.  I received it within a week and watched it that night.  It is a sad story but is so well written and acted that it makes it a great movie.  Angelina Jolie plays Gia's character and does an amazing job portraying her.  Except for the very beginning, I felt as though I was watching Gia rather than Angelina Jolie.  I lent it to my sister who watched it several times and loved it and she too had never heard of the movie.  I would highly reccommend it to any adult with the caveat that it is not an uplifting movie, but very real and is about a model's life.

0316010669|4.0|This is my favorite of Gladwell's conceptual ideas. I try to remind myself of it every day, that the information we gather in a blink of time is what we use to ascertain a situation. Why I bother gathering more is beyond me. How often I come back to that original burst of thought and wished I had listened to it. Of course, some impulsive thoughts are worth resisting and I suppose the secret is learnig to tell which is which, that is, which is worth a blink and which is worth a look.
B000ZFI1GK|5.0|The Eagles prove that after all these years they are still relevent.  I thought the the HFO reunion and subsequent tour was it. However they renewed their fans appreciation for the hits by touring in '02 and again in '05 with the \\"Farewell one\\" tour. The music in LROE is reminiscent of earlier day's but is remarkably timely. Great harmonies and guitar work.  I recommend LROE to anyone who enjoy's country and rock.    JC
0679722610|4.0|Red Harvest is one of only five full length novels completed by the legendary Dashiell Hammett.  The action unfolds in a western mining town nicknamed Poisonville. It's protagonist and first person narrator is the Continental Op, a San Francisco detective whose name the reader never learns.  Summoned to Poisonville by local newspaper publisher Donald Willsson, the Continental Op quickly gets a taste of the town's predilection for violence when Willson is murdered before the two men even have a chance to meet.  In the following days, a seemingly never ending series of shootings, stabbings and bombings account for multiple deaths in a nihilistic frenzy of violence fueled by greed, corruption, jealousy and unbridled aggression.  A number of the killings are instigated by the Continental Op himself. It is his belief that only through purging the town of its plentiful criminal element will anything resembling normalcy ever have a chance of gaining a foothold.  As always, Hammett's writing is crisp and highly readable.  Most of the characters are colorful and quite fascinating to read about.   On the negative side, I found the the narrative a bit too convoluted for my taste.  Worthwhile reading for Hammett fans but less compelling than either The Maltese Falcon or The Thin Man.

1594201927|4.0|Niall Ferguson has written a fascinating account of finance in his economic history, \\"The Ascent of Money.\\"<br /><br />Although he looks at some pre-modern concepts concerning money (Babylonian trade, feudal specie monopolies) the story is really about the invention of various instruments of \\"finance\\" which mark the beginning of the Enlightenment era in Europe.  People today rarely have insight into the fact all of the financial tools we take for granted today had to actually be *invented*.  Someone, or a group of people, had to literally come up with the idea for; fractional reserve banking, public debt (bonds,) joint stock enterprises and secondary equity markets (stock exchanges,) insurance, housing mortgages, etc.<br /><br />None of this was available throughout most of human history, so the opportunity to expand *wealth* was extremely limited (mostly limited to how much gold you could get out of the ground.)<br /><br />Throughout the Enlightenment, with the invention of finance, came a rapid expansion of created wealth, which made possible the greatest improvement of living standards for average people in the history of humanity.  Something which we take for granted today, but is not so obvious to people in the world still untouched by the Enlightenment.<br /><br />Ferguson's writing style makes this an easy read, and the subject - which one could easily assume to be rather dry - is actually compelling.  Ferguson opens the door for us on a world of geniuses and scoundrels, high politics and worlds at war, booms and busts that is as interesting as any mere political history or biography.<br /><br />Given the criticality of finance in today's economic crisis, reading Ferguson's book will help the layman understand exactly how financial instruments are simultaneously necessary for all human progress, and a dangerous tool when used irresponsibly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
031606792X|4.0|I just wanted to say how annoying it was to read a customer review and instantly have the book SPOILED.  Amazon should have \\"spoiler warnings\\" on customer reviews.  Many people read reviews to see if they want to check something out in the first place. Come on!  How was I supposed to know? I thought book reviews were \\"good\\" or \\"bad!\\" Not \\"here is the entire storyline...\\"     That being said...I recommend this entire series for anyone who wants to lose themselves and be entertained; magically transformed into a giggling 13 year old girl again.  The writing is sometimes laughably cheesy/repetitive/bleh, but, it's a fun read reguardless.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Yes released this in 1972 but it stands today with even the younger(reasonable) 30ish-40's generation(X)  The first track is a raw and energetic start to the odd, yet quite ultra modern sound to Yes's early works.  Wakemen's classical peice is like elevator music, yet a pleasant drop into the renasaunce(usual for him as he is the ren's fair of the quintette), Track 3 is the Anderson vocal test of enchantating \\"Yes\\" \\"We - Have - Heaven\\" a hundred times, SSoS is my personal favortie a hard edged peice like a fusion energy of clutter very grungy for the period, 5% of Nothing is Bill Bruford's edtion and plays out much like \\"Daisey's Revenge\\" of the group \\"Blues Image\\", a percussive solo and with IMO much the same atoneal way, Long Distance Runaround is much like track 1 but more on the major(as in non-minor) and cheerful, not as progressively \\"dark purple\\"(I am guessing the terminolgy is but who cares about terminology!) as \\"Roundabout\\", The Fish is Chris Squire's bass predominance, and since I am partial to bass(played as a foreground melodic instrument) it is one of my favorites, as is the band member who plays bass that defines \\"Yes\\" and got my attention to thier sound in the first place! \\"Mood for a Day\\" is another ren's fair peice by the lead gitarist, Steve Howe, quite classical and green spring by the pond(visually), Heart of the Sunrise, the final(offical) track is a rush from less to more energy with Jon Anderson's lite vocals in at places, Steve Howe is at his best here(gitarwise), \\"America\\" is a weird song based on the Simon and Garfunkle tune, and is an advanced view on US(Us) state's people's country and ways.  The last is a redux.<br />Fragile and Close to the Edge are two of my all time favorite albumns and much better than thier future or past works!
B0013ND30M|5.0|We've been re-discovering the disney movie collection over the last year and this one ranks pretty high on our list. My 2 year old daughter loves this movie!! She gets so involved in the story. Everytime Aurora goes up to the spindle of the spinning wheel, she tell her \\" Oh no! Don't touch it! Don't touch it!\\"   This movie is very well animated, delightfully told and extremely entertaining for the whole family. One of the best!

I've read all of Sedaris' books and this one deserves to be at the top of the list.  It's a collection of vignettes from his life and was endlessly entertaining to me.  Did I laugh out loud?  Not really.  I did when I read the Christmas letter from Holidays On Ice.  Also when he recounted the story of talking his father into giving his disabled college roommate his watch and belt in one of his other books.<br /><br />There may be no laugh-out-loud segments in this book, but it maintains an entertaining buzz from the first page to the last.  Try to pull that off when telling stories from your own life.  It's a good read and time well spent.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Everything about this series is fabulous. Superb choice of actors, moving, realistic plots (based on true events). You become so attached to the characters that at times it is hard to watch. The HD Blu-Ray version looks amazing. You will not be disappointed.
0316035904|5.0|I never knew Sedaris could write fiction until I read this book.  \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!!!\\" had me laughing out loud in a restaurant (so not me), like I was some crazy, addled ol dude sitting at a corner table sharing a joke with his imaginary friend.  It is a very rich little book.  Read it, you won't be sorry.
0553381687|2.0|I love epic fantasy, yet I'd never picked up this series...because the covers are so boring. Pathetic, I know. But you know what? In this case, turns out I did judge the book pretty well by the cover.<br />This book just did not do it for me. Too much court intrigue, too little action. Way too many characters to keep track of, and nary a one that I came to care about much. I didn't find the writing to be very good, either. Martin's descriptions were more confusing that illuminating, and he could take a lesson from Tad Williams when it comes to metaphor and imagery.<br />I also can't understand why Martin includes so much graphic sexual content in the book. To make it more \\"realistic\\"? Dude, you're writing a FANTASY series. It wouldn't bother me, but I know this genre is very popular amoung middle and high school students. Not sure if I'd want my kid reading about rape, incest, oral sex, etc.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Shortly after getting signed to the R.O.C., Kanye West whos one of my favorite artists in the hip hop game, went right to the studio to work on his first official solo release. The Outcome of the finished product? Nothing short of classic. You could put some of the tracks off The College Dropout up against any hip-hop single that has been released since kanye dropped this album and they could easily hold their own. As an MC, West shines as well. His flow is catchy to the listening ear and his lyrics can be fun or emotional depending on how kanye is feeling on a given track. The College Dropout contains some of the most intelligent and clever hip-hop you'll ever find. The Content on the College Dropout has something for the older generation of hip hop fans to enjoy as well as the younger generation like myself to rock. A Hip Hop classic for the ages.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|There are a few albums by various bands that are among rocks best: Dark Side, Quadrophenia, Close to the Edge, 2112 and so on.<br />This is one of those albums.<br />Although hard rock to early metal in style it transcends all rock genres and should be in anyones collection.<br />It is also one of those few live albums (like Priests \\"Unleashed in the East,\\" & Kansas' \\"Two for the Show,\\" where the live performances are better than any of the bands studio work.<br />Simply a great must have album!
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This is my first Bluray movie. Comparing it with my old DVD movies I must to admit the difference in video quality is noticeable. In the case of sound, perhaps I didn't get a big difference comparing with DVD.    It's a good action movie, I believe it's better as Ang Lee's version.
0375826726|5.0|I wholeheartedly disagree with some of the reviews.  The whole trilogy are involves in politics.  If overthrowing Galbatorix is the issue, politics are always involved.  Even with all the races in Alagaesia, its always going to be about politics.      I find that knowing all the politics of Elves, Dwarfs, and all races involved helpful and ties all the stories together to one common bond.  To impeach their evil king, and bring peace to their land forever-more.      Wonderful book, I am anticipating the next and last book of the Inheritance.
B001CWOCV8|1.0|Inserted in a state-of-the-art Panasonic DMP-BD35 Blu-Ray Player with latest firmware version 1.7, the disc plays fine all the way through the long promotional trailer, which advertises several Universal Music Blu-ray titles including this one. At the end of trailer the player simply STOPS!.  The menu for the Lionel Richie content never comes up and CANNOT BE ACCESSED! I tried every conceivable \\"work around\\" to try to get it to play Lionel Richie content.  I own over 60 Blu-ray discs, all of which play fine in this player and I am not new to Blu-ray having owned a Panasonic DMP-BD10a before this player.  The same thing happened with TW0 (2) Blu-ray discs.  The first one I purchased via amazon.com/uk. The second one I purchased from amazon.com  Same result.  Last year, I ordered this title on standard DVD and one whole channel would not play. Lionel Richie should be upset and FIRE somebody!  Absolutely ridiculous!  And very frustrating, expensive and time consuming for this fan!

0553382179|5.0|This book is a great find!  There are so many books out today on how to get better organized and while the concept is certainly one that everyone can relate to and needs to work on, often it is too difficult to find the time to squeeze in the necessary steps it takes to GET better organized!  With this book, Maria Cilley, otherwise known as the \\"FlyLady\\", offers practical ways to declutter and then clean your house in increments of time that are very manageable and practical.  She emphasizes \\"baby steps\\" and says that your house didn't get in the state it's in overnight and so you shouldn't expect to be able to fix it that quickly either.  She wisely states that if you do attempt a quick fix, which is always much more time consuming, you will end up burning out or getting overwhelmed and will ultimately fail.  The best part about this book for me is that it really felt like she was speaking directly to ME and her descriptions seemed to be ABOUT me.  At long last I feel that I have found something that will truly help me dig myself out of the mess that is my house!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is feeling snowed under by housework.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins, a British zoologist whose book The Selfish Gene showed that man is to a large extent the product of his genes, has here turned his attention to man's belief in a creator. We have been schooled to believe in a god, but there is absolutely no evidence for it; it flies in the face of rationalty and commonsense. Every page of Dawkins's book attempts to unpick the tangled web we over the centuries have woven about the invisible man living in the sky. Less abrasive than Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris, nevertheless Dawkins is thorough and fair. Like Daniel Dennett, Dawkins attempts to demystify religion.  It is well past time for doing just that

B000VWOV3O|5.0|This collection is part of a series of popular rock and jazz artists who have five albums packaged together at a (mostly) competitive price. These are no frills - not a \\"limited edition\\" collectable - and a fantastic way for new fans to become acquainted with an artist and for others to replace vinyl editions without breaking the bank.<br /><br />Each CD comes in a mini-LP sleeve and - from what I can gather - is a replica of the original, so any errors in any notes are not corrected. I guess that's a bonus for those who enjoy reading agate type...and then complaining about mistakes.<br /><br />The albums are the five recorded from 1971 to 1975, which includes the fusion classics The Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Birds of Fire (1973), the live Between Nothingness and Eternity (1973), the orchestral Apocalypse (1974) and Visions of the Emerald Beyond (1975).<br /><br />The 1970s was an  incredible decade for John McLaughlin and this collection nearly has the entire output from the band from this time period (a buyer is only missing Inner Worlds [1976], and The Lost Trident Sessions from 1973, which wasn't issued until 1999).
B001HUHBAE|5.0|This a top quality film in every aspect, of course I love most of David Fincher's work. Zodiac is also one of the best blu-rays out there. The presentation is so realistic it really is as if you are looking through a window and if you reach through you could feel the textures and experience the atmosphere. If this blu does not make you go WOW you most likely need to adjust your display's picture settings.
B000059T1V|5.0|Muddy Waters was 45 years old when this recording was made in 1960. At that time, Muddy had already logged in over 15 years as a professional musician, working mainly in the rough-and-tumble blues joints on the South Side of Chicago.<br /><br />He was well known by blues musicians and fans around the world and was considered by many to be the \\"father\\" or \\"king\\" of the electric Chicago blues style. Of course, he is now immortal.<br /><br />This excellent recording features Muddy playing mostly Chicago standards with a tight group of musicians who are also well known to blues fans. Most of the songs Muddy Waters recorded during his career were slow-to midtempo blues and, with a couple of exceptions, this set is no different.<br /><br />The moderate tempos allow the listener to absorb the deeply soulful singing, licks, solos, and overall arrangements. In addition, these are excellent reference recordings for emerging blues musicians.<br /><br />The arrangements played by the classic Chicago blues bands were mostly \\"head arrangements,\\" which tend to be raw and earthy when contrasted with Kansas City or Memphis blues bands.<br /><br />As a musician Muddy Waters stayed with what he knew and loved, while watching others with far less talent scoop up lots of money playing lightweight pop-rock songs. For this, and his supreme talent, his memory deserves to be preserved and honored.

0307269752|5.0|What makes a great story? I'm not sure. But upon finishing this story I felt a satisfaction, a breadth and depth of feeling for the characters, especially the male and female protagonists, that rarely occurs, especially in a story that could mistakenly be called mystery.<br />At its heart, 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is a tale of abused women by disturbed and hateful men. It's also about a particular woman with a mysterious past struggling to get on in a world which mostly barely tolerates her, tries little to understand her, and cruelly abuses her (by someone she should be able to trust). Lisbeth Salander also struggles with the painful chore of developing a moral compass and grounding, with little help from others, apparently including her family. She apparently has some sort of mental disorder which denies her the satisfactions of socialization. She's a savant, which enables her to find work of a specialized nature, and, importantly, allows her do it largely alone.<br />Mikael Blomkvist, a magazine publisher, convicted of libel, gets manipulated into working for an aged and retired industrialist on a 40-year-old mystery. He struggles with his loss of reputation--his integrity meaning a great deal to him--resulting from the libel conviction. During his investigation he struggles with what 'means' is it okay to pursue to achieve the desired 'end.' He's a bit naive, and a genuinely good-hearted fellow, who finds himself mixed up with people who deliberately take advantage of him, but his don't-take-it-personally attitude repeatedly enables him to keep his eyes on the tasks, including impending jail time, that ultimately demand his focus.<br />On many levels, this is as finely a written story, with fully developed characters, originality, and suspense, that one could hope for.<br />Being a somewhat slow reader, that I was captivated so as to read the last 250 pages of this story in a day testifies to the enthralling part one of Mr. Larsson's trilogy.

B00000IQV7|5.0|For me, \\"Patch Adams\\" is the best film ever to remind us all that laughter is the best medicine. It is fresh as a squirting daisy--not a cliched or sentimental moment in the script. The scene where the little children with cancer all arrive in the courtroom wearing rubber clown noses to support Patch in his hour of need is one of the most unexpected and deeply moving things you will ever see. If you don't cry at that moment, you must not be human.    I think everybody should be more like Patch. At the auto garage where I work I've used some of Patch's techniques to liven up the atmosphere-- putting an oil funnel on top of my head, wearing a fake mustache and funny eyeglasses, cracking lots of jokes. Think about it for a minute--your car breaks down, you have to sit by the roadside all afternoon in the hot sun, the tow truck costs an arm and a leg. Aren't you going to want a little comic relief while I explain how you need to have a new transmission installed? I thought so!     \\"Patch Adams\\" is more than a movie--it's a way of life!

0060578793|1.0|First this is NOT a \\"SAS\\" survival handbook but a book written by John \\"Lofty\\" Wiseman who got out of the SAS in 1985.... Yeap real up to date.... here it says he was in for 26 years and he is on youtube saying 27 years and he states he got out in 1985.  The book uses the name SAS as if this is what the British military uses and it is NOT.  I am sure the title helps sell this book, but the content is not up to date and is lacking in many areas.  The book is some what helpful but if you think your getting a true military manual from the SAS your not.  There are many good military survival manuals here on Amazon.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This was a very enjoyable film, thanks motly to Gwyneth Paltrow, who gave a clear portrayal of the essence of the book, of the same name, written by the much celebrated author, Jane Austen.   I would offer a moderate recommendation to those who particularly enjoy the work of this author, & who enjoy the quality of performance offered by G. Paltrow.  I did think that casting Toni Collette as Harriet Smith was a very poor choice, but I am unable to suggest who might be qualified for that part.

1416562605|2.0|I read it with great anticipation and was thoroughly disappointed. It was entertaining and I will give it that.  But beyond that I don't think it had anything redeeming.     Frankly I am quite taken aback that this received the Booker Prize. The Man Booker prize has slipped a few notches in my esteem purely for this one wrong choice. [\\"The Sea of Poppies\\" (Amitava Ghosh) was vastly superior to this book in all aspects - the sweep of the novel, the quality of writing and the enagagement level it creates as well as its ability to bring alive a bygone time so vividly.[    The gist of \\"The White Tiger\\" has been described by various reviewers so I will leave that aspect.    What I am really fuming about is the utter callousness with which a wrong picture is painted about India and its citizenry. Every character is a cardboard character and completely stereotypical and I must say fully out of touch with reality.     Why 2 stars then? It was an entertaining read, that's all.
0385340990|4.0|The reviews of this book frequently use the word \\"delightful\\" and that's an apt word. The characters are charming, the period voice feels right, there are enough painful stories from the war to make it feel real without having so many as to make the book unpleasantly grim, and well, this is just a nicebook to read.<br /><br />I'd especially recommend it for fans of Helene Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road; the tone and the literary references are so similar I'd be shocked if that book weren't one of the influence on this one.  (After all, even in England in 1946 were there all *that* many fans of Elia?)<br /><br />I'm subtracting one star for holes in the internal logic; I have some trouble believing that the island's inhabitants would be so happy to have a book written about them by someone they'd known for so short a time. People seem very quick to trust, in general, especially right after so many years of having to be so cautious of betrayal. I may be wrong, but I think the British reserve and the remnants of the class system would have played a greater role throughout than they do here; the language in the first part is perfect 1946 (I wasn't around; I'm using Hanff as a standard) but it's a bit less period-perfect toward the end of the book.<br /><br />It deserves four stars, though, because none of these things diminished my enjoyment of the book; they just left me thinking \\"But, wait-\\" afterward.

Of course it can't beat seeing BMG live, but hey, it's a lot cheaper this way!
031606792X|1.0|As mentioned in most of the one star reviews, one of the main problems with this book is the fact that the author completely abandoned the rules that she had established in the previous 3 books regarding vampire physiology and behavior, and it seems like the only motivation for doing this was to provide a plot for her final book and a happy ending for every single character.  Everyone gets what they want and it doesn't cost them anything.  That was plain lazy writing and a betrayal of the readers that invested their time and emotions into the series.    Possible Spoilers Ahead    However, my biggest problem with this book was the way that Meyer resolved the love triangle.  I understand if her plan was always to have Bella choose Edward.  But what doesn't make sense is the way that she went about having Bella make that choice.  Meyer spent two books (New Moon and Eclipse) describing Bella's relationship with Jacob, the joy she felt in his company...they have fun, they laugh, they tease, they comfort each other...Meyer establishes Jacob as a true companion for Bella.  Despite Bella's continued assertions that she doesn't have romantic feelings for Jacob, her actions and emotions say something completely different.  This could make sense if the readers where being given an insight into the character's feeling that she herself might not be aware of...However, that doesn't end up being the case.    In contrast Bella and Edward's relationship is established almost exclusively with the author's and Bella's insistence that they are in love and meant to be together.  The reader never gets to see or understand why this is so.  I can't remember them ever actually doing anything together (other than all the angst ridden kissing) or really communicating with each other (other than telling each other how in love they are).  I got the feeling that they didn't really know or understand each other....    My point is that while it is the author's prerogative to decide who Bella chooses to love, she has an obligation to have it make sense to the reader.  She should have shown us why Bella chooses Edward, not simply told us that it was so.
B000HIVOI2|4.0|This BD was nice.  Except, when it came to the scene where everyone was speaking alien/egyptian - there were no subtitles on the screen.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|If you enjoy the Bourne series as much as my family does you will want this package. We bought a Sony Blu-ray DVD player which actually shows normal DVDs well and enhances the audio and video on others. But you can not imagine what it's like to watch (I know it's weird) the regular DVD first and then the Blu-ray version right afterward on the same day. The video and audio quality are outstanding. Great package for a great price. I only plan to replace those movies in my limited library (yes, the economy has wacked me also) with Blu-ray. But future buys will be Blu-ray. There is no question that if you truly enjoy Bourne you will want this.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|This is a Musical for the SIN CITY and 300 crowd.    Not a reluctant fan of either Tim Burton or Johnny Depp or Stephen Sondheim, I came to the viewing with an open mind and a willingness to be entertained.  And, I was entertained, though I scraped over the bare patches of the director's self-indulgence with some discomfort.    The acting was good to very good, and the enterprise well cast.  But the clotted, muddy sound quality didn't help me understand Bonham-Carter's cockney mutterings and mewings.      However, the decors and atmosphere appeared to me to be grand guignolish, heavy-handed and opressive to a degree.  Perhaps Burton took his cue from ST's opening song about London?  Still, it was as if the story itself wasn't poignant and horrible enough; the director encouraged the designers to underline and bold every puncuation mark and seraph with spooky-wooky horror until the whole thing -- including particularly the final scenes in the underground abbatoir -- simply became a ride through a Spook House with Auschwitz touches.  Overdone.  A little restraint even in (the depiction of) throat-slitting would have been appreciated.    However, light, mordantly comic moments included big bugs in the dough Mrs. Lovitt kneaded.  Very nice.  Like the entire enterprise itself, ultra-Dickensian.  The flair and subtlety with which she brought to life the slovenly, desparate amorality of the character was rewarding.  Obviously, the expedience required for survival in a life of filth, facilitates the entrepreneurial skill needed to exploit commercially profitable cannibalism.  Well done!    Personally, I find the experience of watching this version of the show encourages me to look at and listen to others.  Watching it once or twice has stimulated my curiosity and heightened my appreciation for a piece of work that in itself may be better than expected.
0061122416|4.0|O.K. it's corny, this story about a poor shepherd boy's quest to find meaning in life. But it's also compelling and sure to touch a reader's personal yearnings for fulfillment. I found myself underlining little gems of wisdom and inspiration throughout and even bought a copy for a friend. If you're currently slogging toward some goal that's starting to seem pretty elusive, you may well find this brief book a welcome shot of encouragement.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is one of the best American movies of the last 50 years, and certainly one of the very best comedies.  All the praise given out by the reviewers here and elsewhere is deserved, and I can and do say with certainty that if you aren't made of stone you will laugh your head off.    Granted, the film has been created on Wierdland's back lot -- which  Burton has staked out for himself, and which he's resolutely plowed for some years -- it appears, nevertheless, that comparing Burton's wonderful BATMAN and all his other exciting apparitions, this effort comes off best.  Why?  Complex answer required, but in a word, Humanity.    GENRE STUFF.  Everybody loves show-biz flicks, as much as they love movies and talkies themselves; from the Barrymore shows (ROYAL FAMILY) to SINGING IN THE RAIN, to A STAR IS BORN (1 and 2),  Garland and Rooney and beyond.  It's a category worthy of a book, or even a library or two.  And ED WOOD is certainly in that genre.  It's the story of a sort of idiot-savant of cinema who managed, somehow, to rise to the negative celebrity of \\"The Worst Director Of All Time\\" cult status.  That's a campy kind of category, both cloying and redundant.  Actually, his movies fit or mis-fit into the category of American non-studio or experimental cinema that sprang up after WW II.  Put it somewhere close to Kenneth Anger's films.   His time-frame is 50's.  That includes not only look -- costumes, sets, cars and props, but language.  And I think its here that ED WOOD separates itself from the other Burton films; the writing is just a little bit better.  The construction of the movie, scene by scene is good, but the dialogue is fabulous!  Crisp, brief, idiomatic without being either cute or campy, it has that Hollywood/USA POP culture sound of the decade.  Brilliantly done.  Ultimately, the credit for that little bit of extra something that makes this movie so unbelievably fine, belongs to the writers.    HOLLYWIERD DAZE?  OK, but whatever the movie appears to be about, the real meaning is layered: it is an expression of Faith; faith in the redemptive and transformational power of the love of the performer's trance, whether on stage or here, on sound stage and for film.  (Remember Wood's malapropism, 'Havent' you heard about the suspension of disbelief?')  It used to be that in the beginning the saying about Chaplin was, \\"You take Mable Norman and a stepladder to the park, and you come back with a movie.\\"  That's the way it was and is, essentially, in Chaplin's LIMELIGHT or in Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, or one of the Bergman films about Theatre or Circus.  This movie, like those, takes place far beneath the layers of technique that disguise mediocre material and dazzle with tricks, noise and light; the conformist cinema.  It takes place in the arena of bare-knuckled, face-to-face human encounter.  Freak-to-freak, if you will.  And it exhibits a truly religious faith on one's ability to make Magic.    Personally, ED WOOD resonates with me because I spent some years working in a similar kind of never-land of semi-improvisatory theatre and film in New York, with a director equally as inept as Wood, and equally as driven, though far, far less likeable.  The memory of frantic ineptitude overwhelms me!  We called the kind of location shooting we did -- streets, interiors -- Guerilla or Hit-And-Run.  No permits.  Hurry!  Hurry!  Watch out for the cops!  Improvise.  Edit in the camera.  His career spanned 42nd St. Sexploitation shows to English Spatter Flicks.  Ugly junk, mostly.  Nothing much came of any of it, though a very few people who went on to have small or minor careers in professional cinema owe their careers largely to that first exposure.  Bad movies, but oh! the intoxication of creation without censure!
0385341075|4.0|The narrator starts as a thirteen year old girl on a Pacific island that has just joined a civil war.  One of the only whites who has not fled the island, Mr. Watts, decides to teach the children although he admittedly is not a teacher.  His teaching consists of reading Great Expectations and bringing in the community's adults to teach whatever they know.  The first third of the book is this warm and cuddly account, sure to bring a smile to the reader, especially if the reader loves books.  The only tension is the narrator's mother's jealousy of the teacher.    Just as it begins to be too big a bowl of warm milk, the plot switches to the community suddenly being embroiled in the civil war.  The conflict within the community comes to the fore and the book changes flavor.  Mr. Watts, always trying to do the right thing, becomes the victim of subterfuge and then more.  Mother and Watts' fates intermingle in surprising manner.  As a side plot, the narrator also gets to know Mr. Watts and his wife and their tragic story.    Lastly, the book shifts to the present when the narrator is a doctoral candidate.  She goes to the big city to get the lowdown on who Mr. Watts was before coming to the island.  This portion fills in the blanks, especially in the story of Mr. Watts and his wife.    Each of the components of this book is different from the others and good.  The shift prevents any one of the segmetns from getting bogged down and the novel moves quickly.    A combination of coming of age, and a study of loyalty, subterfuge and how to be a \\"gentleman\\" according to Mr. Watts, this book is highly recommended.
B000P7V45S|5.0|It is so great to finally have a digitally remastered copy of Trick of the Tail.  All I had before this was an audiocassette of an old crackly LP.  I had forgotten what an awesome album this is.  The DVD was interesting to see but I believe that Genesis is much better to listen to than to watch.  I could do without seeing almost constant closeups of Phil Collins' head.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|The fourth season of \\"Lost\\" is way too short, brought on by the Hollywood writer's strike that year, but it continues to amaze. Every time I think they've gone too far and this series should end, they pull out something new and I want it to go on and on. All great TV series should end before they Jump the Shark and embarrass themselves. \\"The Prisoner\\" was just about perfect with 17 episodes. \\"Twin Peaks,\\" again, nearly perfect. \\"Northern Exposure\\" went one season too far, as did \\"Highlander.\\" \\"The X-Files\\" should have been about 8.5 seasons, cutting out the really terrible crap from season eight. So my hope is that the creators of \\"Lost\\" are smart enough to take the series as far as they can while still being innovative, yet knowing when to quit. Season four definitely makes me eager to see season five.
B001BPJJ82|4.0|***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />THE FALL is going to rank up there as one of the most visually stunning films you've probably never heard of. Filmed in India, France, Romania, Indonesia, Africa, Italy, the Maldives, Turkey, Nepal, Egypt, China, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Indonesia, and the U.S., the film's broad leaps from continents and countries makes for some incredible shots that fall across the screen time and again.<br /><br />Combining both child-like fantasy and human frailty, the story is seen through the eyes of a child named Alexandria (unknown 9-year-old starlet Catinca Untaru). Recovering at a hospital in 1920s Los Angeles, she stumble upon a severely injured stuntman named Roy (Lee Pace, [[ASIN:B000MXPE7O The Good Shepherd]]). Roy wants nothing more than to end his now miserable existence by overdosing on morphine. And he sees a way to get it when Alexandria comes to him as a friend. He regales her with a fantastical story about bandits, adventurous scientists and freed slaves. We, the audience, view the storytelling through the mind of Alexandria as she interprets what Roy tells her, making for some pretty lighthearted moments. But mixed amongst them is the seriousness of what Roy wants from her: for her to get a bottle of medicine so he can commit suicide.<br /><br />As the story Roy tells her comes to a close, and he becomes more desperate for the drugs, Alexandria \\"falls\\" and re-injures herself while trying to obtain the medication Roy wanted in order to end his life. Adding to her injuries, Roy must finish the story by telling her who lives and who dies, but Alexandria isn't ready for that \\"fall\\". Is Roy ready? That, as they say, is where the real story rests, and where the real story ends.<br /><br />The acting isn't stellar by any means, but the sweeping vistas, amazing dissolves, and nearly painted-on, picture-perfect shots will have most watchers' mouths gaping. The intimacy of the story and how it unfolds also adds an emotional uniqueness that will probably surprise most viewers. I know I was.<br /><br />If you want something that's a stunning spectacle in the style of [[ASIN:B00003CXKM The Cell]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXR4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]], then you'll gobble up The Fall.most viewers.

B001PP9ALY|4.0|\\"Wanted\\" is a very watchable action movie.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones!  They are lightweight, comfortable, have really decent sound, & durable.  I still eventually manage to stress & ruin a wire, so I order extra.  Cannot find them in the stores, & cannot be without my sounds.         Did I mention very affordable?  It does not wound my pocket book to replace a pair, as I am rather rough on the headphones.  I highly recommend this product.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I first got this on VHS when I was 14 and started doing it every single day (the two alternating workouts). I had heard about people supposedly getting injured doing it, and was warned not to do it by friends, but I never had a single problem.  I got into amazing shape, my cardio fitness was very good and I felt so good after each workout.  My core strength and muscle tone were great.<br /><br />At 18 I stopped, cause I got lazy, put on a lot of weight and at 28 have just started doing these workouts again.  My tips to others would be: do as is advised and drink lots of water and rest between sets and repetitions; only do the number of repetitions you can manage without pain - don't stress because it does get easier and you will be able to do them all eventually; and be sensible.  Obviously if you throw your body around like it's made of rubber you will hurt yourself.  Do the exercises slowly and carefully, at least until your fitness and strength improve.  If you find you cannot keep up with the pace of the video/DVD, just pause it until you can catch up and then resume watching.<br /><br />These are great workouts you can do almost anywhere and it annoys me when people criticise it.  Probably because it's Cindy Crawford people find it easier to pick on it, but I have never been in better shape or felt better than when I did these workouts regularly.

1439102813|5.0|Fifty-year old Alice Howland, a world-renowned expert in linguistics and a cognitive psychology professor at Harvard is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  Still Alice is the story of the unraveling of Alice's life as her disease progresses.    I started out not enjoying this book.  The author's main character wasn't very likeable - she seemed too focused on how smart she was and how important and prestigious her job was, but I was quickly won over.  Lisa Genova wrote from Alice's perspective so the reader joins in the fear, disorientation, and confusion that come with the progression of Alzheimer's.  Alice's relationships with her family and their varying responses to Alice's decline are extremely believable, and the most touching parts of the book are the evolution of her relationships with her husband and children as her disease progresses.      Still Alice is a fantastic book that provides an incredible window into the progression of Alzheimer's disease and is both terrifying and heart-rending.  Warning - it will make you question all your middle-age moments of forgetfulness

B00000420F|5.0|It just isn't that easy to find Paisello. Scarlatti isn't as widely recorded as he deserves to be, and Bartoli and Fischer have made some other fine selections, too! Don't be concerned that this is a piano and voice recording, Gyorgy Fischer makes his pianoforte do all of the work the instrument is designed to do. Sometimes it sounds almost like a harpsichord -- I looked to see if one was listed and if it was there, I couldn't find it. At other times, Fischer uses the full range of the pianoforte.     I'm going to look for recordings by him with piano and orchestra.    Fischer's accompaniment is soft and limpid where it should be, leaving room for all the tonal qualities of Bartoli's voice to come through, and strong and vivid when it's the piano's turn.    Bartoli sings these selections with feeling, and with a precision that keeps them from going over the top. (If someone has seen a recording of her at the end of one performance of Cenerentola where she sang well and didn't let her energy die, but also was not, for some reason, able to control her performance as well as usual, don't worry: her voice is beautifully produced throughout and never rushed. Even the best of us have the occasional off day.) This recording represents some of the best work I've heard from Bartoli. She uses some gorgeous trills, runs and arpeggios, but neither does her ornamentation get in the way of the songs.     Near the end of \\"Arminio, opera: Pur dicesti, o bocca bella\\" she puts in, for example, a gorgeous trill, but with a controlled dimenuendo I found very impressive indeed.    Ladies and gentlemen, THIS is bel canto!    The disk comes with a nice Italian - English translation of each song. (The translations do not repeat every line of text every time she sings it, but her diction is very clear here, and I don't think that loses anything.)
B00064ADR0|4.0|Johnny Winter's second album for Columbia Records came out in 1969, and it is one of his most stylistically diverse offerings, and his most idiosyncratic as well.   It is not a pure blues album, nor a rock n' roll record, although there is plenty of blues here, and a solid helping of rock n' roll as well...it is sort of psychedelic blues-rock record which includes shades of funk, hard rock, and a little bit of jazz.    Johnny Winter is backed by his usual power trio of Tommy Shannon and John Turner, plus brother Edgar Winter on piano, organ, sax, and the occational harpsichord (!). And I'll come right out and say that I didn't like this album very much when I first heard it maybe ten years ago. I had only heard a couple of Johnny Winter's records before, and those had been almost pure blues, so this odd, eclectic mix of blues, \\"old time rock n' roll\\", and psychedelia wasn't really to my liking. I've always disliked psychedelia, no matter who plays it.  But \\"Second Winter\\" has grown on me to some extend. It will never be among my favourite Johnny Winter-albums, that honour belongs to \\"White, Hot and Blue\\" and the phenomenal \\"Live Bootleg\\"-series, but it does have its moments. This expanded double-disc edition has quite a few of them, in fact, including an entire live CD.     To me, Johnny Winter is at his best when he is playing the blues, and even as great as he is as both a singer and a guitarist, his covers of early rock n' roll standards are just not QUITE as mesmerizing. But, having said that, I'll be the first to admit that his take on Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" really rocks! The piano boogie of \\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\" is generic but fun, and Edgar Winter is a terrific R&B piano player. He also contributes mightily to the swaggering \\"Miss Ann\\" (originally a Little Richard-tune), this time playing the sax, and Winter rips through one of the most fiery Bob Dylan-covers you'll ever hear on the classic \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". I'm a really big fan of the aforementioned \\"Bootleg\\"-series, but this is still the best version of this song I've ever heard from Johnny Winter.    The heavy blues \\"I Love Everybody\\" with its screaming, overdriven guitar attack is another highlight, and its jazzy, horn-laden sister-track \\"I Hate Everybody\\", sort of a frenetic jump-blues, is worth a listen as well.   At the end of disc one comes two bonus cuts, a too-psychedelic and over-produced \\"Early In The Morning\\", and an equally forgettable instrumental version of Ray Charles' \\"Tell The Truth\\" which'll quickly fade from memory. Unless you're much more into psychedelic organ flourishes than am I, that is.    But then comes a 72-minute live recording of Winter playing the Royal Albert Hall in April, 1970. He is backed by the same three musicians that recorded \\"Second Winter\\" with him, but the psychedelia has been stripped away, and Winter and the band tear through powerful, fiery renditions of songs like \\"Johnny B. Goode\\", the high-octane \\"Dust My Broom\\"-knock-off \\"Black Cat Blues\\", and a somewhat more agreable \\"Tell The Truth\\" (now with vocals!).  Sonny Boy Williamson II's classic blues \\"Help Me\\" and J.B. Lenoir's boogie \\"Mama Talk To Your Daughter\\" are transformed into sizzling blues-rockers with some absolutely magnificent lead guitar playing, and songs like the twelve-minute \\"It's My Own Fault\\" and the eleven-minute slide guitar-fest \\"Mean Town Blues\\" is Johnny at his bluesy best.     The sound is absolutely excellent, and Johnny Winter's astounding abilities as a guitar player were never more apparent than in a live setting. Okay, so I'm not overly fond of the over-long \\"Tobacco Road\\", or of Edgar Winter's nine-minute instrumental \\"Frankenstein\\", but everything else is good, and most of it is just plain great! And disc one is better than I originally thought, as well ;-)
B0000041Q3|5.0|This was recorded in 1972, and everyone's voice is fresh and strong. Not every recording of Turandot can field two absolutely top ranked sopranos, but Dame Joan Sutherland and Montseratt Caballe are both fabulous. They could have switched roles as easily as each singing the one she had.    This features also my absolute FAVORITE recording of Luciano Pavarotti singing \\"Nessun Dorma.\\" His riddle songs and \\"Non piangere Liu\\" are -- well the truth is that this is the most perfect recording of any audio only opera I own. It ranks, for me, with the movie version of _Carmen_ with Ruggiero Raimondi, Placido Domingo, Julia Mingines Jones, Faith Esham and others.    For an audio only disk to tie for number one with a DVD movie disc, the audio must be fabulous. It is.    Every singer's voice has special things that lend it wonder, and for Pavarotti, one of the things that is special and impossible to match is the wonderful warm roundness of his voice. More, he can produce that with character and power.     I have Carreras' DVD of Turandot with Eva Marton and Katia Riccarelli. He's fabulous, especially because of his skill as an actor, and I'm glad to have added that to my collection. Despite that, I am still glad that this Sutherland, Pavarotti, Caballe and Mehta recording is the first recording of Turandot, and the second recording of a full length opera I bought.    Among other things, the included libretto translates Italian into French, English and German, and the liner notes are astute and well written.    Get this recording. Yes, it's expensive, but it is worth every penny. No voice can match Pavarotti's for Calaf as recorded here. No voice can match Caballe, Sutherland or Ghiaurov's for their roles. Ping, Pang and Pong are fabulous!

This movie had a all-star cast of outstanding actors!<br /><br /> One of my favorite things, that I liked about the movie was the breathtaking outdoor scenes, and I loved the way, the movie people shot some of the scenes, during the early morning hours, when the light is at it's very best for capturing moments on film; It was outstanding!<br /> I would love to know where this movie was filmed, they chose a very pretty place to make the movie, and also know, the history of the house Cinderella lived in with her step family, and I would just love to know the history of the castle, and the surrounding area!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for all us ladies out there, who fell in love with the Cinderella story, when we where little girls! This movie will not disappoint you, if you are a true Cinderella fan, and a hopeless romantic!<br /><br /> And you will just love the man who played Prince Henry, (Cinderella's Prince) he is very, very, handsome! I loved his hair, and his pretty, bedroom  eyes! One of my favorite scenes in the movie, was when Prince Henry went to see Cinderella, and invited her to spend the day with him! And I loved the special, wonderful scene, where Prince Henry kneeled down to asked Danielle (Cinderella) to marry him!
B001NFNFNU|5.0|THE CHANGELING is a success in everything that it sets out to do. It is a rarity in film making in that it also manages to make you feel every emotion that you have in your gut. It's not often that this translates from the screen to the viewer in such a palpable manner and steadily progress the storyline.<br /><br />This suspenseful tragedy is expertly directed by Clint Eastwood and despite the fact that it's about a possibly dead child it manages to let you simmer in your emotions rather some of his other depression-inducing movies that I've seen. This feeling in this is more on par with his newest film GRAND TORINO.<br /><br />It's 1928 in Los Angeles and the police department is oozing with corruption to the point where they murder the gangsters not out of a sense of justice but out of competition in the illegal money making rackets. It is in front of this backdrop that we are introduced to the protagonist, Christine Collins, who is a single mother who works as a switchboard operator.<br /><br />Christine establishes her honesty and integrity very early in the film by explaining to her son that his father couldn't accept responsibility rather than lie to him.<br />There was no one else to help but some neighbors who were to check in on him when Christine went to work. She returns from her job later that night to find that her son is missing and it is impossible to know how long he has been gone. She calls the police and receives the standard, \\"We can't do anything for 24 hours and besides, these kids always show up.\\" In her case her son did not show up and she is frantically trying to locate him as any mother would.<br /><br />John Malkovich plays a minister who has a radio show that focuses on exposing the corruption and cons with which the police department is rife and he had quite a following of concerned citizens who are with him. He discusses Christine's case on the radio.<br />With all of the negative exposure the police department has been getting for their nefarious deeds they do not want another black eye.<br /><br />A little boy is brought to Christine and is announced by the police in front of the media to be hers. He is not her child although he pretends to be. She tries to protest amid the media frenzy that he is not hers. She takes him home and tries to figure out what is going on and why this child is calling her \\"mommy.\\" In very short order she is back at the police station trying to explain the situation and ends up being accused as being either a negligent parent who doesn't want her child or a woman who was so disrupted by her son missing as to become unhinged. The police know that they have given her the wrong child and have her admitted to an insane asylum where she encounters many other women who are in there for the same reason as her. They are all there for saying the police are wrong and locked away to cover up the many misdeeds by law enforcement.<br /><br />Christine tries to do all of the right things to get out but realizes that anything she does or says can be interpreted as some disorder or another.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the minister is trying to find out what happened to her and is demanding to know where she is. At the same time a seemingly vagrant child is found on an old ranch and the local police think that he's just trying to escape extradition to Canada but he has a story about his uncle to tell...<br />It gets far murkier from there.<br /><br />For me to go any further into the climax and falling action of the plot would ruin the suspense of the film and I wouldn't do that in a review. My assertion is that this is a 5 star movie if I've ever seen one and is probably Jolie's best role and performance to date. Malkovich is great as well.<br /><br />This film is all the more affecting in the fact that it's a true story. 80 years ago or today this is the kind of tale that can pull your emotions in a million different ways and leave you feeling vanquished before it is finished. All of the costumes and props lend incredible validity to the story. I felt like I was in a 1928 time warp while watching it.<br /><br />All in all, one of Jolie, Malkovich, and Eastwood's finest films.<br />Highly recommended. This is a must see even if you may only want to see it once to preserve your nerves.<br />Kevin W. Mattingly<br />Harrisburg Times.928 time warp while watching it.

Spending time uncovering it's layers reminded me about beauty even though things were dark, and repeat listenings of \\"Automatic\\" along with the events of my life taught me so much about empathy.  I can't recommend this CD more highly.  I wouldn't be the person I am without it.  It's a masterpiece, and my favorite album ever.

B001OW5NT6|3.0|This \\"No-Excuse Truth to Understanding Guys\\" explains a variety of relationship issues, such as guys not calling, disappearing, cheating, etc.  The explanation is universally that if the guy really wanted to be with you, he would not be acting in this way.

1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama has grown since 1995; but this book has a quiet tone of honesty. This book has shown the author's integrity, and that reveals the power this book has. After I read the book I knew I HAD to listen to Obama as he read it. As the 6th CD was nearing the final pages, a sudden calm came to me and I fought back tears. I knew at that moment Barack Obama was the perfect spiritual order for America. I felt something I had not felt in decades. I felt hope.

B001O5DR3W|2.0|Previously impressed with all Ridley's works, this one? Hmmm. Could have watched \\"The Unit\\" on CBS and gotten the same result. Only with that TV series I would have at least experienced an appropriate ending. No wonder this movie had no \\"press\\" - it is definitely \\"less than\\" in many areas. First and foremost? No ending. All it accomplished was to further impress the fact there's dramatic problems in the middle east - that we have no real power over, and probably never will at the cost of too many american lives. If that was the reason for producing this movie, well, it was successful. As an entertainment piece? Nope. Am now proceeding to my Video On Demands and Amazon Unbox to delete this disappointing movie.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|First let's get the obvious out of the way, this album is a thousand times better than St. Anger. It sounds much more like heavy metal than any of their studio albums since the 1991 Black album. It has a decent sound most of the time. Three things I don't like, however.<br /><br />1) Jame's voice is still a little wild and screetchy, he's got it all over the place. I want the intense, 80's voice back.<br />2) The structure of the songs is a little clumsy in transitions at times, it stumbles from one sound to the next with no flow.<br />3) There isn't one really catchy \\"hook song\\" with an awesome beat like Enter Sandman or One. I know, some fans who think they are more hardcore than others sneer at these, but I like them. I also appreciate some of the lesser known \\"sleeper\\" hits like Leper Messiah. At least they finally gave us another (nearly) instrumental song again, that was cool.<br /><br />Metallica has come so far with this one, I hope they will finish the journey back to true metal in the future. There aren't any horrible stinker songs on here, but nothing truly great, either. All the songs are either good or ok; I don't mind rocking them in my Mustang. When Death Magnetic comes up on my ipod random shuffle, I don't skip past it, like I do with Load, Reload and St. Anger.

Okay, I was a bit bummed that Edward and Bella got married so fast - I was totally on board with the vision of them going to college together and all that good stuff.

I was still on board. However, all of my general good feelings plummeted around page 375 when Bella is changed into a vampire and everything went down hill on a burning sleigh of doom. It seemed to me that it was similar to in some sit-coms - there's all this romantic tension between two actors, when they get together, the tension is gone, and you realize it was much better when there was all that tension. Pfft. When there was all the tension between Edward and Bella because of her humanness I liked the two of them much better than I did once that tension was lifted. And don't even get me started on the bizarrely named half vampire baby. Sorry Mrs. Meyer, I just couldn't stay on board with this one.

B001DPHDCY|4.0|This movie is the best Seuss remake by far.  When it comes to Dr. Seuss, he should be kept as animation and not be moved into the world of live action.  This movie is great fun for any age.  I knew I would enjoy it, but was shocked to find my more serious boyfriend laughing out loud at it.  A good movie to have on hand for a bit of light-hearted entertainment. My only gripe with this particular item is that they only labeled one side of the disk with the Fullscreen/Widescreen info, and it makes for a confusing first time playing the movie if you are set on watching one or the other.  Otherwise, awesome!

B000KC4LNU|5.0|This duo was very much a part of the sixties music movement but were hard to \\"piegeon hole.\\" When asked \\"What Kind of Music Did They Sing.\\" it's hard to give it a known classification. Although there songs were on the Top 40, they were not rock n' roll.  What is certain is they were immensely popular. The harmonies are terrific with few back ground instruments except for Simon's guitar. I think they spoke the words many were searching for but could not express and some of the songs were just fun and fun to sing along like \\"MRS. ROBINSON (from the movie THE GRADUATE.) Other songs one might recognize are AMERICA, SAVE THE LIFE OF MY CHILD, and FAKIN' IT.  A terrific record for a different taste of the sixties.

0441013597|2.0|While \\"Dune\\" is an excellent exercise of world-building by Frank Herbert, the novel lacks many of the elements that I consider good storytelling.  There is never really much of an element of suspense throughout the book, and the reader has the impression that he or she already knows how the book is going to end from the very beginning.  It's a bit difficult to sympathize with the protagonists.  \\"Dune\\" is obviously more fantasy than science fiction, but Paul is always a bit too sure of himself for this book to feel like some kind of bildungsroman as is typical of the fantasy genre.  The Bene Gesserit as a whole are an incredibly annoying concept in their seeming omnipotence and omniscience, and the whole concept of them seems a heavy-handed ploy to make female characters an important element in the plot. There are too few elements of protagonist vs. antagonist direct conflict in the book, and when they do occur the action appears a bit stilted and anticlimactic.  As Paul and his mother's powers grow in the book, one gets a sense that they are basically unstoppable and that the antagonists are absolutely no match for them whatsoever, which was incredibly vexing and made me eager to put the book down.    Why this book is considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, I have absolutely no idea.  Sure, the world created by Herbert is incredibly detailed (although implausible), but if you can't tell a story well, the book isn't going to work.  This is one of the more overrated novels in science-fiction history, but perhaps I've watched too much \\"Star Wars\\" and read too much \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter,\\" where there actually is an excellent story to go along with excellent world-building elements, to really appreciate \\"Dune.\\"

B00005O3VD|4.0|I recently rewatched FUNNY GIRL for the first time in perhaps twenty years.  And though I still think it is a fine film I was not as charmed by it as I was in my earlier days.  Maybe I've read too much about the real Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein and found out how very sanitized Arnstein's life story was for the Broadway musical and this film that is quite closely adapted from it.  For whatever reason I did not find Omar Sharif's portrayal of the handsome gambler Nick  as breathtaking in this viewing and I actually found his accent annoying.    At any rate  the film is still a must see for musical lovers and those like me with an interest in entertainment history though the viewer should be very aware of the  great deal of license taken in retelling this bittersweet love story.  And Streisand of course was young and at her full powers in her star making role as Fanny that still seems positively tailor made for her voice, looks and screen presence.

B0002NRQTS|4.0|Before Presto came out in November 1989 I had really been anticipating its release, mainly because I wanted to see how well this follow up to Hold Your Fire would be.  Hold Your Fire came out two years earlier and got a lot of playing time in our household and among my friends.  I was not disappointed, though it took a while to grow on me totally.<br /><br />It starts out with Show Don't Tell, a song that pretty much rocks.  The next track, Chain Lightning, is good as well.  One thing I noticed immediately was the sound and tone of this album.  It is different from all other Rush material.  It sounds sort of stripped down with light bass, as if Geddy Lee had his bass turned down.  Alex Lifeson's guitar sounds light as well.  The whole album sounds higher pitched or \\"filtered.\\"  My first thought was that it's possible that the fact that Rush was recording with a new record company (Atlantic) was the reason for this different sound/tone.  Also, they had a different producer.  Anyway, the next song is sort of ballad-like, The Pass.  A good tune, followed by War Paint.  The next track is my favorite track on the whole album, Scars.  It has a sort of African beat to it with a great bass line.  The next track is the title track, Presto.  A mellow song, but great lyrics and finesse.  Next is Superconductor, with some backup vocals provided by Alex Lifeson.  The next track is Anagram (For Mongo).  Red Tide is a song about the elements and dangers to the environment.  The next track is Hand Over Fist, a solid song with a great melody.  In my opinion, this song is to Presto what Kid Gloves is to Grace Under Pressure.  These songs to me are similar in some strange way.  Not similar sounding or similar lyrically, but similar in structure I guess.  I can't really pinpoint the reason why.  The album closes with a great song that people forget about, Available Light.  Another mellow song, but it shows the band's talent and depth.<br /><br />A lot of people have shunned this album over the years, people who were longing for the harder Rush from the past.  To me, this album was the fifth \\"new Rush\\" album that began in 1982 with Signals.  \\"New Rush\\" is Rush that is more mellow and with no epic length songs on their albums.  If you don't have this album because you wouldn't touch it back in 1989 up until today because you prefer the harder stuff, I would buy it because you are missing something good.rs, people who were longing for the harder Rush from the past.

0440244870|5.0|Funny that I read the first book of the series LAST. This is a very well written book and it keeps up the charactors with lots of wit and hilarity. Funny thing is; alot of women are shopaholics. We sometimes shop for sport; sometimes we shop because we crave color and visual stimulation. But the end effect of buying something new is a lovely, warm-feeling after-glow that is similar to experiencing some sort of triumph.<br />The book is great, then I saw the movie.<br />The movie is a bit better than the book. It's more realistic, and it teaches everyone a lesson about spending when one doesn't have money, or a well-paying job. What I didn't like about this book is it villifies the bill collector; the poor sap from the bank is made out to be the bad guy, when it's not he who did the whirwind, spendaholic shopping.<br />That's the thing - - - there's a moral and a lesson in these stories, but somehow the main protagonist, Rebecca Bloomwood, escapes her due process.<br />I am glad to have read the entire thing, but I am equally relieved that I am finished with the series.<br />I have learned a valuable lesson when it comes to my own shopping. It can't go on like there's no tomorrow.<br />It can't continue like there's a Money Tree growing in my back yard.<br />I has to come to an end, it has to remain reasonable, and it shouldn't be treated like something that's a joke.<br />The country is in a major recession, and we all have to work hard to save our financial resources.<br />This is a great country with the strongest financial resources and we are being tested in these modern times.<br />It's good to save, build a nest egg and hold onto good investments.<br />Style trends come and fashion changes from month to month.<br />A strong savings account is a greater thing to strive for. That's what these books have taught me.

B000TXG3YA|5.0|I played this CD in my car for about a month. If you like this type of music then you will probably like it. These guys have a real musical talent. They have a unique sound and style. If you have heard any one of the songs on this album and liked it then you will also like the whole album because there is no filler.  Artistically speaking, this band is way better than most of the crap that gets played on free radio. It's a shame bands like this don't hit the mainstream. This is a good album to crank up in the car because it is really heavy. The riffs are awesome and it also has some acoustic parts that are great too. I love the production quality because it is mixed well and the acoustic parts sound especially clear and crisp. I think this was voted album of the year by some magazine or something. I saw them in concert with High On Fire and Opeth and they were pretty good.

0743554450|5.0|I will limit my review to expressing my strong disagreement with the Publishers Weekly review of the unabridged audio CD, which was critical of the reading by Atossa Leoni.  I believe Ms. Leoni does an excellent job, most notably by conveying in her Afghan inflections a real sense of the sounds of Afghanistan, and a feeling that you are listening to a woman who really understands the circumstances of the two women who are the protagonists of this novel.  A reading by a more \\"Western\\" voice would convey the perspective of an observer rather than a participant.     During the course of listening to the CDs in my car, where the listening environment is not optimal because of road noise, I never found it difficult to understand a word.      In sum, the choice of Ms. Leoni as reader was excellent, and Ms. Leoni's performance admirable.

Yes people, if you aren't advanced you will feel like you're dying, BUT you can do modified movements. If you can't do jumping jacks, just because Jillian says not to doesn't mean she will spank you if you do! If there are cardio movements that you can't do due to knee problems or something simliar, do a different cardio move. As long as you keep moving you'll be okay. There is no need to give up at all.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|I just finished re-watching Cabaret and it is even better than I remembered it.  It is a dazzling ball at the Satan, the Feast during the time of plague. It is an unforgettable film, made by the master, the screen version of his own stage masterwork. It is dark, prophetic capture of \\"divine decadence\\" that paved the road to the most horrifying hell of unspeakable catastrophe that the world had not seen before. Bob Fosse proved in his only second directed film how talented he was in everything he was doing. Shot entirely on the location in Berlin with the Kit Kat Club cabaret of the title as a real centerpiece of the movie, \\"Cabaret\\" is a marvel of directing, editing, color settings, that in combination with brilliantly clever and catchy songs, creates the doomed ambiguous atmosphere of uncertainty, hanging onto the present moment, and not daring to imagine to whom tomorrow belongs and what tomorrow will bring. It is impossible to talk about Cabaret and not to mention the international cast of the young talented actors who played the characters of their own nationality. Two definite stars of the film are without doubt Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles and Joel Grey as creepy devilish MC.  For me, the film belongs to Liza Minnelli who gave performance of such energy, charisma, and exuberance, that it has become Liza's calling card and, her claim to cinematic immortality. Under her rather intimidating makeup -  her eyes that took up the good half of her face, the eyelashes so long that they can reach the opposite wall of the room, the impossible garish colors of her eyelids that probably glow in darkness unmistakably announcing her presence and  colored in dark green finger nails that can be considered the dangerous weapon, Sally is vulgar but vulnerable, corrupted but lovable, oblivious but lonely, talented but stuck in the cabaret Kit Kat Club where the music never stops and life is always beautiful ...<br /><br /> In 1973, Cabaret competed for the Best Picture of the Year award with number one of 250 Best Movies as per IMDB users, Francis Coppola's Godfather.

1416594884|4.0|Nice to see an intelligently written book of this genre.  The storyline is a little less complex and more discernible than some of Le Carre's older spy thrillers.  But still - at the risk of sounding like the Emperor in \\"Amadeus\\" complaining that a Mozart piece has \\"too many notes\\" - I think it has \\"too many characters\\" at least among the secondary players that we find in the German, American and British intelligence and police services -- hard to keep everyone straight.  A movie version might help in this regard.  But the main characters:  Brue, Annabel, Bachman, and Issa, are all original and interesting personae.    There's an occasional bit of political/editorial commentary inserted into the mouths of some of the characters, but it's not laid on too heavily (as in Crichton's \\"State of Fear\\" for example) and frankly I'm pretty much in agreement with the author's perspective anyway.

B0019MLVEM|5.0|This is a great album to listen to after a break-up. The Script has been compared to a UK version of Maroon 5 (who I love), but this album is more on the sad side of Maroon 5. There are only a couple of up-beat & positive songs, but that's fine if you've just gone through a break-up. The lyrics are meaningful & paint a story (\\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\"). My two favorite songs on the album are \\"Breakeven\\" & \\"If You See Kay.\\"    If you like the style of Maroon 5 & are feeling a bit sad, this is definitely an album you need to listen to.

Maybe I just like this movie (I'm not even partial to Ironman) but I re-watch this a lot more than any of my other DVDs and Blu-Rays, and it always looks great on my HDTV. There are plenty of special features in high definition on the second disc, including detailed renderings of Iron Man's armor for the artistically curious.

0385736002|3.0|Based on the historical but rather mysterious characters of Nicholas Flamel and Dr. John Dee, THE ALCHEMYST by Michael Scott is an almost-frantic romp through an imaginative modern-day world in which magical figures still exist, hidden amidst ordinary humans.  The conflict in the book is nothing new, being a rehash of the ancient struggle between good and evil.  The fact that mythological and magical characters take an active part in the struggle, using magic as their weapons, is reminiscent of Rowling's Harry Potter books and of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  In fact, while Nicholas Flamel is historical and could have provided inspiration for both Rowling and Scott writing quite independently of each other, one wonders if Rowling's use of Flamel and his \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" in her first book did not provide Scott's inspiration.  The fact that Tolkien provided inspiration is indisputable, since Scott goes out of his way to mention \\"Hobbits,\\" or at least their fossilized remains, in THE ALCHEMYST.  Such being the case, it would have been only courteous of Scott to have acknowledged the works of Rowling and of Tolkien in the \\"Author's Note\\" or the \\"Acknowledgments\\" pages at the back of his book, and the fact that he does not strikes me as rather mean-spirited.<br /><br />I also have a problem with the depiction of Josh.  He frequently comes across as a stereotyped image of an adolescent boy full of equal parts of bravado and ignorance, one who is quicker to open his mouth than to think.  While the other characters generally come across as believable (assuming one accepts the premise that we are in a world full of hidden magic), Josh seems artificial, stilted, and two-dimensional by contrast.  Perhaps part of this reaction derives from the fact that the reader concludes early on that Josh and his twin sister will prove to be the heroes in the epic struggle of good and evil, and the reader is therefore disappointed in Josh's immature thoughts and actions, the fact that he is only fifteen years old notwithstanding.  After all, his twin sister, who is, obviously, also fifteen, is far more level-headed and adapts sensibly to changing situations in the story, underscoring Josh's rebellious denial of \\"reality.\\"<br /><br />Let us hasten not to make too much of this book, however.  Unlike Tolkien's writing, Scott's is devoid of meaningful symbolism or allegory.  Unlike Rowling, Scott does not explore the psychology of his characters or see them develop--they remain \\"flat,\\" i.e., the same at the end of the book as they were at its beginning.  Scott's THE ALCHEMYST depends entirely upon the superficial action to sustain reader interest.  On the positive side, Scott does rely upon well-described mythological and historical characters, rather skillfully interweaving their traditional selves into a modern-day context.  He also sustains the action very well indeed--the story absolutely gallops along.  We should note also that the book is not complete, being only the beginning of the story, which is continued in a sequel, THE MAGICIAN:  BOOK 2 OF the SECRETS OF THE IMMORTAL NICHOLAS FLAMEL.<br /><br />Overall, my sense is that THE ALCHEMYST will appeal primarily to young readers, pre- and early-teenage, but then it's also a purely fun read for more mature readers looking for a fast, escapist story with lots of action, something to distract them from the stresses and worries of the real world for a brief time.

B0002KP5FI|5.0|Seems like you either love this album or hate it. Some people seem to want artist to do the same thing all the time. To me if it swings, or has a nice groove, I do not care if it has a synth bass or an acoustic bass, real drums or a drum a machine. In this outing Conte went acoustic with real instruments and serious players from the Italian jazz scene. He seems heavily influenced buy Blue Note from the 60's.  Some of that music was played on juke boxes at the time and inspired the whole acid jazz movement. Listen to Horace Silver's The Tokyo Blues album you will see what I mean. Conte seems to have been heavily influenced by that album. This outing has no filler, all strong tunes. If it has Conte's name on it it will be cool, classy with lots of latin percussion .
B001GKYBXA|3.0|Though not as good as Sgt. Pepper's or the white album, it is nice to see Paul experimenting again.  This album is similar to the white album, not in terms of sound, but in the fact that it reaches out in several different directions.    I use the name \\"Paul\\" loosely.  As most Beatle fans know, the original Paul McCartney died in 1965 or 1966.  I don't know the birth name of the guy who is playing Paul now.  Whatever it was, he probably had it legally changed to Paul McCartney (in order to cash checks, etc.).  It doesn't really matter what his name was before he became Paul McCartney.    My point is that I love both Paul McCartneys, and I am hoping that Beatle fans will create an environment where \\"Paul\\" can come clean and clear his conscience on the issue.  This  must be weighing heavily on his mind.  He's probably worried that if he tells the truth about his real identity, people will call him a fraud.      I don't view him as a fraud.  This is the same guy (presumably) who sang vocals on Hey Jude.  Hey Jude is one of the greatest recordings ever.  Let's give this guy the credit he deserves.    No real Beatle fan should view this guy as a fraud.  We should embrace him with open arms.  He did a brilliant job of keeping Paul alive long enough to record such classic albums as Sgt. Pepper's, the white album, and Abbey Road.  And keep in mind, the Beatles probably approached this guy and begged him to take on the role of Paul.  Who could resist three begging Beatles?

B001GCUNVW|5.0|I'm not a sports fan, certainly not a fan of pro wrestling.  However I caught a glimpse of Mickey Rourke on some late night talk show and I was so impressed that I ran to see this movie.  Wow!  Now I'm a fan...well, not of pro wrestling, but certainly of Mickey.    The story is basically a simple come-back story but it goes beyond Rocky and Cinderella Man with its attention to the human element. It could have been really bad but the director avoided a lot of potential pit falls.  The characters were \\"types\\" -- the broken down athlete, the stripper with a heart of gold, the bitter, alienated daughter--- but they are portrayed and acted with such care that they transcend all cliches.  The other wrestlers, who, again, are almost cartoons in appearance, seem like real people.  duh...they are!      The main draw here, though, is the performance of Rourke.  Much has already been said about the parallels between his life and that of the Ram, so I won't elaborate further.  But whatever contributed to his performance---be it his own life or sheer talent (drugs?) this is deeply moving.  It stuck with me long after the film was over.  What struck me the most weren't the fantastic stunts in the ring, although they were impressive, but the simple close ups of Rourke's face---whoa!  The depth of feeling is palpable.    I join the many others who are routing for MR to take home the Oscar.  Even if he misses it, this performance should be enough to keep him in the limelight and working for a long time.      Marissa Tomei is also wonderful as the stripper.  Most reviews her call her \\"over the hill\\" but I'd like to comment that if this is what an \\"over-the-hill\\" body looks like, I'd like to welcome that hill!  She is as impressive in her arena (pole dancing) as The Ram is in his.  They mirror each other--she wants to be more than a stripper--wants to be seen as a mom, someone with dignity, and is saving to get her child out of the neighborhood.  She encourages and inspires the Ram and they come to connect in a way that is as pure and real as their pro-lives are tacky.  I route for her to take an Oscar home, too for her courageous, vulnerable performance.    My only complaint is the sudden ending.  I know that happy endings aren't in style these days...(but look at Slumdog Millionaire!) but, for my money it was too abrupt.  I'm not saying it had to be all rosey but something needed to happen to resolve the tremendous energy that built up in the final match.  When I saw it in the theater, everyone just sat in their seats, numb, as if waiting for something else to happen,  Eastwood  handled that problem beautifully in Million Dollar Baby with the final, silent scene of his character alone in the diner after the death of Hillary Swank. Maybe if they had put in a happy ending, it would have made the nominations for Best Picture. It worked for Rocky and Cinderella Man. (I found it a much better film than Slumdog.)      A final note:  this is definitely not for kids.  I had to close my eyes during one of the gorier matches.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I love Enya's music. I find her music very soothing and comforting to listen to after a long day at the office, or on a snowy winter night. In the last few years, Enya's albums have been a bit uneven for me. They were either a hit or miss with me. This is not the case with AND WINTER CAME. After putting out a couple of holiday themed singles/EPs, I think it was time for a full length holiday album. AND WINTER CAME did not disappoint me. one bit. Although Christmas has come and gone, I still enjoy listening to AND WINTER CAME. I love the title track. The delicate melodies is a great opener for the album. I find her version of \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" very emotionally stirring. Enya's vocals sends chills down my spine. \\"Dreams are More Precious\\" is another beautiful ballad reminiscent of Enya's earlier material. Granted the music lacks the Celtic flavor that I have come to love about Enya's music however I can overlook that minor misstep. After a recent dump of some fresh snow where I live, AND WINTER CAME comforts me on this wintery morning with its lush melodies and ethereal vocals by Enya.

The instructions are clear, and the photographs are true to what the motif ends up looking like. I loved reading the introductory chapters, and seeing all the ideas put out there for using the motifs. There were new techniques in here that made a big difference in all of me crocheting...no more too large holes in the centers of my squares, circles and flowers. I am an experienced crocheter, and I would recommend this book to anyone, from beginner to expert.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|For all the tens of people yearning for Ryan Adams to reform Whiskeytown, this is probably the closest you'll ever get. His most country-tinged album since the breakup of that band, Ryan returns to his musical roots on this double album (which really could have been just one long disc, a la Gold).    Ryan pulls a Neil Young and credits the album to \\"Ryan Adams and the Cardinals,\\" a band formed for the purposes of recording it. Despite its obvious country tilt, this album will have something for all Ryan's differing fans, the country - \\"Magnolia Mountain,\\" \\"Let It Ride,\\" the rockers - \\"Cold Roses,\\" \\"Beautiful Sorta,\\" and the ballads - \\"Now That You're Gone,\\" \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive.\\" The latter song is one of his loveliest and would not be out of place on Heartbreaker or Love Is Hell, I wouldn't doubt if it was recorded during the sessions for LIH.    Ryan explores his relationship with God and nature in detail on this album. He starts by talking about \\"the rocks of the mountain my saviour made\\" in the opener, \\"Magnolia Mountain.\\" The album is peppered with these sort of references. \\"Close my eyes, see the glorious sunset/Through the windows of a store and I want it/Anyway, if I ever felt haunted/You were there for me...\\" \\"Hear all them bells ringing out in the street/Oh, hammer strikes the metal and it makes me believe/'Cause if I don't believe in love/Then I don't believe in you/And I do\\"    Church bells? There are numerous references to God, angels, and souls, for example, in \\"Let It Ride\\" - \\"Let it ride/Let it take away all of this darkness/Let it ride/Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels until it brings me home...\\" He's not being preachy to any extent, but I get the sense that this album is Ryan's declaration of his faith. It's not the only theme, but it is a theme.    This is not Ryan's best work, but that is Heartbreaker, and few have reached the greatness of that album. It is, however, stronger than its most obvious comparison for length and variety of songs, Gold. With two more albums released in 2005, it was a fine year for Ryan Adams fans.

B000002KKC|5.0|The problem with Tusk is that your immediate impulse is to compare it to its predecessor, Rumours. In a way, it's like comparing Revolver or Sgt. Pepper's to The White Album. While the single albums may represent the greatest coming together of the group as a band, the double albums represent the individuals in that band at their peak.    While Tusk belongs to the whole band, it is Lindsay Buckingham's baby.  His songs on this album are often referred to as experimental, but they're only really so in that they're not \\"Go Your Own Way.\\" In a sense, his portion of Tusk could be considered the first \\"indie\\" album. They're not particularly radio-friendly, even if the title cut was the first single off the album. However, they're the type of thing many of today's indie bands only WISH they could write. \\"Not That Funny\\" sounds like it would fit in nicely on Modest Mouse's next album.    While Lindsay's compositions take up nearly half the album, Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie also make large contributions. Nicks's \\"Sara\\" may be the best song of her career, and Buckingham's production  on that song in particular is some of the best ever put on record, forget \\"Mutt\\" Lange's still-to-come efforts with Def Leppard. McVie kicks off the album with its least representational, and perhaps prettiest song, \\"Over & Over,\\" a slice of music that wraps you up and tells you that everything is going to be all right, no matter how bleak things may seem.    I give this album five stars, the same as Rumours. Do I like them in the same way? No. Rumours is what you listen to when you're hanging out with your friends, drinking beers and playing pool. Tusk is what you listen to while you're alone in your room, or when you just need something to soothe you. It's like a slice of German chocolate cake or a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream - delicious and slightly self-indulgent.
0312944926|3.0|My first encounter with Dan Brown came with the infamous \\"Da Vinci Code\\" which is apparently one of the biggest selling books in history. I read it and I loved it; I didn't see the criticisms that I had heard about Dan's writing and in fact defended it at every opportunity. I was blinded. Blinded by the hype and the sheer ferocity of the media spotlight, I adored this book before even reading it. Now, two years later and I decided to give one of Dan Browns other books a go thinking it would be equally as brilliant. The difference between then and now being, I have now regained my sight and see the criticisms for what they are; the truth.<br /><br />I don't usually like being patronised. In reality if anyone in person were to deliberately or unintentionally patronise me I would disapprove and tell them so. Unfortunately I can't tell Dan Brown personally, but I can touch upon it in my review. When we read a book we expect the writer to be subtle in their approach and allow the reader to pick up on the important bits as they go along.<br /><br />Most books I have read do this perfectly; they gradually release information about a characters history, appearance and personality. That in my world is good writing and treats the reader equally to themselves in regards to intelligence and character recognition. Dan Brown doesn't do this, he doesn't see his readers as able to pick up subtleties, therefore decides to dedicate almost entire chapters to each characters description. The worst thing about it is in regards to personality, this does not stay consistent to each character which becomes quite frustrating.<br /><br />He also thinks that the overuse of similes and random use of what some would consider \\"long\\" or \\"complicated\\" words are a way of heightening his novel to a higher level of academic fiction. The introductions of these words are used in my view quite magniloquently. He presents these words in a way of \\"look at me and my vocabulary\\" which I see as just absurd.<br /><br />The funniest thing about this book is the front and back cover. Why? Well on the copy I have it has on the front a praising comment from fellow author Nelson Demille which states \\"Pure genius... Dan Brown has to be one of the best, smartest and most accomplished writers in the country.\\" This is the only quote we see endorsing this book and we're not even sure it's in reference to this particular novel. On the back, however, are very funnily comments praising \\"Da Vinci Code.\\" Forgive me if I'm confused here but isn't this book called \\"Digital Fortress?\\" No positive media reviews for this book it seems, and the trend is continued.<br /><br />The story itself is OK, nothing overly brilliant and I must say it did keep me entertained to a degree. I just wouldn't recommend it, and that's a shame as I was hoping for more.about this book is the front and back cover. Why?

B00000DR5D|5.0|It is hard to believe Ricochet was made in 1975 and even harder to believe it is a live album.  The incarnation of Tangerine Dream on this disc consisted of a truly creative trio, that being: Edgar Froese, Chris Franke, and Peter Baumann -- together they produced a great, tight, melodic, flowing, and wonderfully meditational album.  This disc is represenational of the Tangerine Dream era of long compositions -- during this time they were rich in creativeness and improvisational skills, often rendering breath-taking conceptional works. Also, though the CD sleeve of Ricochet says some of the sound may have been compromised transfering the album from the original analog over to digital, there is no noticable sound degradation at all.
0385510454|1.0|Normally I love to read John Grisham's books and usually find that I can't put them down.  With The Broker, I found that I \\"couldn't pick it up.\\"  I ultimately finished it but the first 90% was slow, repetitive and without much story or action.  There was a brief flurry towards the end when it got interesting then the actual ending was abrupt and bland.  There are many better books to read despite the Grisham name.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|I was having a discussion with a much younger person, a college freshman, who was talking enthusiastically about how much she accomplishes on the internet: banking, investing, shopping, updating her information on Facebook. I suggested that she read George Orwell's 1984, Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale and watch the movie The Net. Also to check out what happened during the 2003 North East Blackout when debit cards wouldn't work, computers stopped, cell towers were overloaded so it was hard to make a call and if you needed a card to enter a building, you're out of luck.  This BBC drama takes the whole scenario even further to demonstrate the good and the bad of using surveillance technology to protect us as long as we are considered \\"the good citizens.\\" You don't have to be particularly paraniod to see how many of the things written about in 1984 and The Handmaid's Tale have become matters of course.    This series has excellent acting, plenty of suspense and makes you want to watch it all in one viewing.  It's entertaining as well as thought-provoking.
B000002KGT|5.0|As Classic album Rock was beginning to wane, Fleetwood Mac renewed itself with a different line up retooled many of the songs from The[[ASIN:B000972AKM Buckingham Nicks + Bonus]] album and honed the sound out to a fine point in their \\"White Album\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000002KD5 Fleetwood Mac]].<br /><br />In 1977 The perfection of the polished pop rock sound is in full evidence here in \\"Rumours\\" From Christine McVee's beautiful Ballads like Songbird, Stevie Nick's sexy ramblings in songs like Gold-dust Woman to the driving guitar of Buckingham the exquisite bass of John McVee, and the insane percussion of Mick Fleetwood, and oh, the harmonies! Great, great song-writing and a group that was nice to look at. They were perfect for the video revolution, if only the could have managed to get along. As it was, they made a few great albums, but none so remarkable and fine as \\"Rumours\\"

David Ogilvy changes all that.  His writing reflects the mad genius that he is, it oozes with passion all the way though his love for his craft.<br /><br />Even if you don't care about advertising, this book pays for itself.<br /><br />But if you are already interested about the subject, this will even heighten your desire.<br /><br />The book also shares his secret, mainly his love for research (acquired from the marvelous George Gallup).  The book even gives advice on how to attract customers if you're new to the advertising field.<br /><br />My two favorite chapters are: Competing with Proctor and Gamble and How to make TV commercials that sell.<br /><br />Reading the whole book will make you feel  knowledgeable than you really are.  That's how good of a salesman D. Ogilvy is.  It's not to take away anything from the book.  But just how powerful his style of writing is.<br /><br />No wonder he is attributed as the number one reason for men and women getting into advertising.
B00007KLJJ|5.0|This movie is a great clasic of Heath Ledger's. I had forgotten how good it was and I'm really glad to have found it from amazon.com. I looked at all the regular stores but was unable to find it any where so I decided to give Amazon a look and luckily I was able to find it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Heath Ledger fan. You won't be disappointed.
