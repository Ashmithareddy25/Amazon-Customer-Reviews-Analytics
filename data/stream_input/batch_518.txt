B00006JDVV|5.0|I admit this movie wasn't designed to win any Oscars, it was meant to enjoy. Reign of Fire is a horrific vision of the future where mankind struggles to survive as dragons rage across the planet, destroying all they come across. Only a few humans have managed to live, by going underground and living a hand to mouth existence. I won't give away much more because I don't want to blow the movie with any spoilers.<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey transformed himself in this movie, looking different than ever before, playing against his normal type, and it works to perfection. Christian Bale is also strong in this movie. As the leader of the British survivors, he shines in his quiet heroism. The special effects aren't anything earthshaking, but they're good. My only question with the special effects was why do the dragons have holes in their wings?<br /><br />The story line leaves a few plot gaps, but like I said, it wasn't meant to be art, it was meant to be what it is: an action charged, explosive packed, fun filled, blood and fire packed movie, that's great for the action movies buff in all of us.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
006016848X|4.0|This book takes a great look at relationships without bashing men or women. On the contrary, it puts a positive spin on both the sexes. The book shows us how and why men and women think and act differently and helps us to understand our partner better. My husband read the book first and encouraged me to read it. Although I have not yet finished it, I see us both making positive changes in how we work with each other.
B00005JNTX|5.0|As a film buff and Robert Rodriguez apprentice, the moment I saw the trailer for this film, I knew that I had to see it. My hopes were foiled again and again by the fact that no other 13 year old, (at least one that I know), had seen the film. Five months I waited. Five months I fought for my cause. Finally, after bickering to an extreme, I convinced my mom to at least SEE the movie. Half way in, my hopes were dashed; she walked saying NO WAY. But perserverance was on my side, and I convinced her to sit through the rest. After te most agonizing 45 minutes of my life, she said the words I needed to hear. <br />      I saw this morning and I am here to say...WOW. Now do not take this review the wrong way, I do not suggest this movie for MOST 13 year olds. It was full of gratuitous and, at some points, downright disturbing, violence. If your resume of films you have been allowed to see and have been unfased by include: The Passion of the Christ, Kill Bill Vol. 1, The Patriot and Saving Private Ryan, and your citizenship grades in school are consistently perfect, then PROBABLY, you should be able to see this film. If not, good luck. After all, luck was on my side. <br />       And now: a general review of the film. This film is my personal new favorite film. Not because of the gratuitous violence, but because of its overwhelmingly cool nature. In my opinion, this film is one of the few modern films that is able to show that there is no good without bad, no happy without sad, no justice without SIN.  <br />       Sin City is a world in which the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are far worse. Its unrealistic nature and black and white cinematography are the two things that keep the violence in check, and allow some of it to be comical. Some seens are so Robert Rodriguez, and by that I mean fantastical gunplay that brings a smile to your face. Its comic book dialogue makes it ring true to the storyline. <br />      Recommendations: Once upon a Time in Mexico, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, Spiderman 2, and Batman Begins. <br /> <br />     All in all, I found Sin City to be a brilliant and well-crafted film. <br /> <br /> <br />     Enjoy.
B000002W9P|5.0|Now people throw around the term \\"classic\\" way to much when discussing metal, but there is no way you can deny this release doesn't deserve such a supposedly prestigious title. This album is literally the epitome of what every power metal release would strive for in the coming years following its release. In the late 80's metal was changing, and Helloween manages to blend a newer Power Metal style with classic 80's metal, creating a masterpiece that even they themselves wouldn't be able to match again. <br /> <br />When I first bought this CD I literally listened to it 4 times in the first day. That may be because it's not all that long, (37 minutes and change) but I literally couldn't get enough of it. There are not many albums like that around, especially in the sometimes \\"cookie cutter\\" Power Metal scene. (there are definitely exceptions) The introductory piece sets the mood for the rest of the album, lending a majesty and mystique to this metallic monster. (Water on the knee? Alliteration!)  <br /> <br />Everything from the songwriting, to the drums, to the composition of the songs, to the sound sampes they use, to Kai Hansens awesome vocals. All of these things are perfect, and I couldn't have asked for more. The sounds samples are really unique and add to the pieces they are used in, such as in \\"A Little Time\\", where they slow the piece down considerable and use a ticking clock followed by a ringing alarm clock to lead into their catchy chorus. It's difficult to explain, but you'll really appreciate the effect it has once you hear it. I love Kai's vocals on this album as well, and his signature voice has been imitated throughout the 90's by many different PM bands. (With Angra having the least success in my opinion)  <br /> <br />If you are the least bit interested in power metal or are just interested in some great metal from the late 80's, I suggest this be the first album you buy. It gives you a little glimpse at some of the great things that were coming out before death and black metal took the metal scene by storm and changed the way we all look at music forever. I love my black and death metal as well, but every once in a while you need an album like this to allow you to truly appreciate all the different aspects and dimensions of this great genre of music (metal) that we listen to.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|<br />Interestingly enough, my dad didn't want to watch this film because he thought it would be too similar to \\"Kung Pow\\", which, being the intellectual stalwart that he is, he found quite stupid.  I must admit that from the previews, I thought more or less the same thing(except that I liked \\"Kung Pow\\"!).  How wrong I was! <br /> <br />It's very hard to categorize \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\".  While in many ways it plays like the classical kung fu \\"chop sockey\\" films of the early 70s (\\"Return of the Dragon\\", \\"Chinese Connection\\", \\"Drunken Master\\", etc.), it's far more than that.  Imagine a blend of Jackie Chan's \\"Drunken Master\\", mixed with \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", \\"Kill Bill\\", with a Road Runner cartoon thrown in for good measure.  It's pure entertainment.  The martial arts sequences are fast-paced and excellent, probably the best I've seen in a film since \\"Hero\\".  There are some great characters(i.e., the Landlady; and the musician assassins have one of the most compelling attacks I've seen in a movie in ages! You'll see what I mean...), and although it's quite violent in places, it also has its light moments, and humor.   <br /> <br />My only criticism would be that the guy who's supposed to be the protagonist doesn't really get that much screen time, and he doesn't do anything remotely honorable or heroic until the very end.  I think writer Stephen Chow could have done a little more with his transformation from gutter slime to super-powered master of the Buddha's Palm.  But hey, it's a movie... ;) Watch it!

1400032717|5.0|\\"The Curious Incdient of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" tells the story of a 15-year old autistic boy named Christopher.  Mark Haddon reflects on the confusions of adolescence and family betrayal alongside the everyday order of things from the autistic mind of the protagonist.  The author has done a remarkable job in getting the readers into the detail-oriented, order-seeking, extremely logical and mathematical mind of Christopher.   <br /> <br />After having read some of the unfavorable reviews of this book, I can see that some readers found the detailed descriptions and elaborations on matters that would not interest non-autistic  minds frustrating and over-whelming.  However, it should be noted that this is actually what the author wants to achieve in this book.  It is a sign of the author's success in creating such a real, strong character.  Therefore, this feature of the book should be praised not criticized. <br /> <br />I believe \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" not only sheds light onto autism and how an autistic mind works, but it also illumates readers on the social dynamics around individuals who share the same grounds with children with special needs.  The book helps the parents of such children in understanding their children's needs and the view from which they interpret the world. Furthermore, it positively reinforces compassion and empathy towards people with special needs.  <br /> <br />Overall, Christopher's story is a touching story.  It is an enjoyable read, with illumating effects on the lives of Autistic children.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Marc Forster's \\"Finding Neverland\\" is the best tale of artistic inspiration since \\"Amadeus.\\"  In that amazing film about Mozart, some of the most enjoyable scenes focused on how Mozart could find inspiration for a musical composition in the dribble composed by a rival, or even in the shrieking of his mother-in-law.  \\"Amadeus\\" left you bewildered at the scope of Mozart's genius. <br /> <br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" shows the inspiration of a talented author that comes from a different source -- love and lost innocence.  The author, J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp, once again magnificent), is trapped both in a loveless marriage and by the social mores of 1903 England.  His latest play is a flop, and his curmudgeonly backer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, redeeming himself for the disastrous \\"Hook\\"), is dropping ominous hints about Barrie's future. <br /> <br />And then, lo and behold, Barrie stumbles across the Widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her four little boys.  Instantly tapping into the active imaginations of these kids, Barrie is soon playing pirates, or cowboys and Indians, or any number of games involving imagination with the tykes.  Out of these games, and also thanks to the harsh discipline vainly imposed by the Sylvia's mother Emma (Julie Christie), the classic tale of \\"Peter Pan\\" is born. <br /> <br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" skirts cheap manipulation but always stays on the side of effective restraint.  Watch for several tear-jerker scenes, especially the perfect choice Barrie makes to ensure on \\"Peter Pan's\\" opening night that the older theater audience \\"gets\\" the play.  But the cast never goes over the top, and this saves the movie. <br /> <br />And while each of the kids in the movie provides performances ranging from good to great, special mention has to be made for Freddie Highmore as Peter.  This little guy is freakishly good, and says more with a glance than many adult actors can do with a rambling speech.   <br /> <br />A heck of a family film that never descends into mawkishness, \\"Finding Neverland,\\" like \\"Peter Pan,\\" has several delights that are worth (and include) a few tears along the way.  Check it out.
B00013RC8O|4.0|The plot is simple..... Kowalski tries to drive a killer super-charged Dodge hemi from point A to point B in X amount of time with the aid of handfulls of little white pills. Meanwhile there's a subplot of personal demons that haunt him, a blind DJ named Supersoul who has somehow \\"connected\\" with Kowalski and gives him some help avoiding the cops. The rest is car chase after car chase beautifully shot from every angle possible. The real star here is the white Challenger that eats up everything in its path including a very fast Jag, two gay guys, a and endless amount of coppers. All the chase are top-notch with very little speeding up of the film to add the effect of speed, and the soundtrack is way above average. This film will really take you back to the 60s-early 70s rural America and there's some nice footage of local color in nearly every scene.  I won't spoil the ending which is a surprise for first time viewers and still makes me a bit depressed to this day. many car chase movie have come along since, some very good (The French Connection, Gumball Rally, Bullit), but Vanishing Point is still the measuring stick for true muscle car action.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|OK. We're talking icon here. If you read novels, mystery thrillers, loyal protaganists, Robert B. Parker is the master. Are there better mystery-thrillers? Yeah. The Long Goodbye still is the tops, Big Sleep not far behind, currently lots of good ones, Mystic, Diehl's (unfortunately not) critically acclaimed Eureka, Landay's recent first timer in Mission Flats.<br /><br />But, Parker does so many things \\"first.\\" Really, first buddy anti-heros, Spenser and Hawk. Lots of cross racial conversations. Gay friends (you weren't the first, Kellerman), tremendous intellect, tremendous loyalty, and a tremendous code to live by.<br /><br />But Spenser is getting on in years and so Parker introduces Jesse Stone. This is the poorest of the Stone novels so I hope Selleck does more. I liked the book for the analysis of Stone's love of his ex; here in the movie it's kind of superficial and Stone's weakness (thank you Bob) is it's always the relationship. He can't let go of his ex-wife. That's why he drinks. And he was a great Triple A ball player. And that unfortunately gets a thin explanation.<br /><br />All in all, kudos to the cast. It's well filmed and the cinematography enhances the double entendre of the name of the town, \\"Paradise.\\" The serial killers were creepy in the book and likewise here. The High School rape issue was a balancing point to show Jesse's humanity, the 'pure' side he likes to hide. Selleck as always does a great job.<br /><br />I liked it. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00005R24K|4.0|Evil Dead was made for like $2 back in the day, just kidding, but it was a really low budget flick, but you wouldn't know it compared to other 'B' movies of its genre. It was an important film because it was made by the venerable Sam Raimi. Yeah, I know he's sold out nowdays making stupid big budget hollywood schlock, but this was made when Raimi was HUNGRY. Raimi pulls out of his bags of tricks (drawn from Kubrick, Hitchcock, and Leone)some clever scenes that sets a mood of sheer terror for a group of college kids on vacation in a secluded mountain cabin. As we've come to expect, Raimi plays this genre as true as possible just he does with whatever genre he tackles, he is indeed a man true to his craft. Supernatural evil abounds (which is THE most terrifying form of evil ) for the group as they mistakenly uncover the acient transcribings of The Book of the Dead which unleashes the evil (the Devil type of evil) on them. Photography is incredible considering the budget, and years later Raimi actually improves his effects with a bigger budget in Evil Dead II, but that's another film review. Raimi uses clever steady-cam shots to create incredible fast-paced moving horror footage that has set a new standard in the genre that no one has really been able to capture but himself. His use of the moving camera smacks of Kubrick's World War I trench scenes in Paths of Glory with a camera flawlessly moving ahead of a victim running for their life from an unseen, but incredibly scary evil force. I could go on an on about the groundbreaking moments of Evil Dead, but I digress. Enjoy this movie with someone in the dark on a cold, foggy night around midnight with the lights off.  A very effective simplistic thriller .
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay, you did it again. Parachutes, Rush of blood and this... keep up the good work! <br /> <br />Although I did not fully enjoy this album, it is in my car but since this is a small island, I never heard it completely, I am already hooked.
B00004U2A1|4.0|Sam Raimi tries to improve the first Evil Dead movie with more budget on Evil Dead II and has considerable success. The story line is the same with added dialoug and plenty more action sequences and more characters, The film is also longer, bordering on too long. Improvements are a notch above everything that was good about the first one. The makeup, the acting, the writing, the plotline, the climax are all improved, albeit just a bit. Raimi makes plenty good use of his incredible steady-cam sequences and adds ample new scary scenes. Overall this is an improved version of the Evil Dead movie with a bit of humor added to break the sheer terror. This is what actually hurts the film after several viewings. raimi keeps you on edge with fear and exciting, pulse pounding horror sequences and absolute terror, then breaks your mood with humor that hits you from left field, or something....builds up terror again only to tease you with a humorous scene amid the horror. It works effectivly until multiple viewings. The climax sets up the underrated \\"Army of Darkness\\" sequel which you may or may not like. many see this as the finer of the two Evil Dead movies, I prefer the original which, I believe today has more chutzpah because it was the first. you won't go wrong renting or owning either. If you like them, you'll own both. Good viewing to all.
0743243307|5.0|In light of the July 7 London bombings I read this book because I wanted to have another perspective into the lives of Muslims in Great Britain. Monica Ali makes a provocative and rewarding leap in her first novel about Nazneen a young Bangladeshi woman who comes to England to marry Chanu, an older man of questionable intelligence. Throughout the book Nazneen comes to terms with her racial, gender and religious identities as a Muslim woman in comtemporary London. One can see the gap between the younger, second generation Bangladeshis, who want to shake up the racist, elitist system and while the older immigrant generation don't want to rock the boat. Feminism also plays a major role in the novel and all the female characters try to reconcile Islam and Eastern traditions with Western realities. The time span of the book revolves around before and after the 9/11 tragedies and Ali does a tasteful job of how each character reacts. This is a great book about a group of people who are still misunderstood in the post September 11/July 7 era.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|John Carpenter's The Fog got slammed at the box office when it was released near the same date as, if I'm not mistaken, the release of Friday the 13th. However similar the movies are, they are ultimately very different. The Fog is more of a thriller than the gore-laden Friday.. film and seems to have had a bit more budget to back it up. Carpenter makes good use of a reliable stable of B-actors (Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, and the venerable Tom Atkins) to deliver a top-notch thriller, and his visual use of the fog is most adequate as a vehicle for adding suspense. The setting (a non-descript northern coast lighthouse radio station) is the perfect setting for this thriller with the cold ocean, the small town atmosphere, THE FOG, and or course, THE LEGEND. Pacing is a bit slow as in most Carpenter movies, but as usual, Carpenter is meticulous in setting mood and the payoff is worth it. There are several genuine spine tingling scenes and a good overall creepiness in the entire film, even the \\"safe\\" daylight shots. Of course, there's plenty to shoot holes through as in any horror/thriller movie this side of Hitchcock, but ultimately the fim wraps up in a good clean manner, and leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling that this was not a thrown together idea put to acetate. Still effective 25 years later.
B000244FDW|3.0|In my opinion, there are only two adaptations of P&P worth watching: this one and the 1995 miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The other ones suffer from shortness. The essence of P&P is not the love story; it is the portraying of a society and its manners and virtues, and you cannot do the book justice in a two hours movie. Thus, I will consider only these two versions in my review. <br /> <br />The 1980 version is, in a way, truer to the book. It changes only some minor details and does not add anything that is not in the book - the 1995 version adds three scenes at least, with the intention of better explaining the character of Darcy to a modern audience.  <br />In fact, it has the air more of a theater play than of a movie, in the style of all BBC series of the time. Darcy is just as handsome and stiff as in the book, Lizzy just as witty. Many dialogues are exactly as in the book, and some narrative passages are included by way of characters meditating.  <br /> <br />But most of the other charaters just don't match. Mr. Bingley is very, very dull and in no way does justice to the book character, which was funny and engaging. Mr. Bennett was another big disappointment, he always seems so unhappy and serious, when in fact he is a man who assumes and accepts his own decisions and mistakes and tries to make the best of them. Wickham shows his true colors in his face and manner right from the beginning, he looks just the scoundrel he is, is is hard to imagine how a sensible girl like Lizzy did not see right through him. He, and especially Lydia, are not expanded well enough, thus their elopement comes out of thin air.  <br /> <br />The only exception were the Gardiners, who look just as in the book. <br /> <br />Lady Catherine will come as a shock to those of you used to the 1995 version, because she is a very different person. Where the 1995 one was perpetually bored and in slow motion, and old, the 1980 one is younger, agile and sparkling. Both interpretations are equally valid, I guess, I cannot decide which one I like best. <br /> <br />As to Darcy and Lizzy: I know Jane Austen never said that Lizzy was beautiful, just that she had very \\"fine eyes\\", but I always felt that she was the kind of person who more than made up for that by her wits and spirit. Lizzy was passionate, and in this movie she is not. (In the discussion with Lady Catherine, she doesn't lose her temper even once.) She acts very well rehearsed lines, but does not get into the character. Or perhaps she just isn't Lizzy as I have pictured it. She and Darcy have no chemistry at all. Chemistry might be a modern concept for the XIXth century, but still, you would like your hero and heroine to look like they belong together, and these two do not. That is even more true for Jane and Bingley, which look like they belong in different movies. <br /> <br />My opinion may be biased because when I first watched this mini series, I had already watched the 1995 version at least 5 times, and to my mind, the characters, dialogues, places and events were well fixed. To me, it was like walking into a familiar house and finding all things just slightly out of place. I felt the impulse to go and put everything back like it was. I guess to any viewer, her favourite of the two will always remain the one she watched first.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun is one of those rare books that really pulls you in and doesn't let go.  Almost every film we see today depicting barbarian-like westerner meets enlightened Japanese sammurai culture is based on this book.  Think about the movie the Last Sammurai, take that story back in time about 300 years, substitute the warmongering western cavalry officer with a salty european sea captain, improve the depth of the story and character development immensly, add about a dozen or so good plot twists, then put in book form, and you will have an idea of what this book is like.

Dejando de lado algunas escenas, como por ejemplo la clasica en la que Demi Moore hace alfareria, es una cinta para ver si no hay otra cosa en cable, pero si aparece algo un poco mejor, no dudo en hacer zapping, y por supuesto que no la alquilariia y menos la compraria.

I will not spoil it for you (discover it for your self ya lazy bum)... but here are some few samples. <br /> <br />+WARNING: MAY BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND (OR ANNOYING)+ <br /> <br />Lateralus - the song <br />black <br />then <br />white are <br />all i see <br />in my infancy <br />then red and yellow came to be <br /> <br />counting each line forms this sequence of number <br />1 1 2 5 8...  <br />this is actually a famous mathematical sequence (fibornacci sequence) where the any given number in the sequence is the sum of two previous number. <br />This number has refrence to nature. (eg. increase of rabit population in an area) <br />The drumming in this song also exhibit this sequence so it cannot be coincidence right? <br /> <br />The number phi (1.6..) which is the fundemental number present in golden ratio (study davinci or read \\"the davinci code), is derived from this sequence of numbers. <br />This number is found in many organic matters. <br />eg 1.ratio the sizes of segments of a finger decreases as it moves away from the palm <br />   2.the ratio of width of one layer of natural spiral (found in snails etc) to the outer layer. <br /> <br /> <br />This number phi ties in with the song. Lateralus the song is understood as refrence to nature, growth, progression and fibbornaci sequence does have its connections. <br />Come on guys... spiral width ratio.... \\"spiral out...keep going\\"  This isnt no coincidence here... or is it? Its true that we are unsure if these deep findings are accidental or not. But thats one of the beauty of this band. <br /> <br />

Get \\"Battlestar Galactica: Season One [SOUNDTRACK]\\" disk, not the other,  \\"Battlestar Galactica [SOUNDTRACK]\\" by Richard Gibbs <br />The Season One disk is enigmatic and fascinating. <br />I didn't really like this new tv series at first...\\"Space Drama...oh boy...,\\" I thought...  I only watched it because it sandwiched the SG-1 shows. <br />I'll get to the point.  The music keeps getting better and better with every episode, so much so that I have become spellbound by this show.  It's the music that does this to you.  It couldn't possibly be more perfect.  Bear Mccreary is a genius.  I have often thought to myself that I could probably be a successful soundtrack composer, but after listening to this Soundtrack and the new standard it sets, I wouldn't want to embarrass myself now... <br />Bear McCreary uses a huge spectrum of sounds: from simple and complex drum beats, Celtic sounds, Middle-Eastern flutes, to creating compositions that would even impress Bach: 24. Passacaglia,  27. Shape of Things to Come.  His timing for soft silence is also perfect and used appropriately: 19. Baltar Panics, 14. Baltar Speaks With Adama, each creates suspense without overwhelming your senses with cheap shock.  Congratulations to Bear for creating an amazing, suspenseful, progressive composition which smoothly transitions complex storylines and subplots with perfection. <br />I am very eager to see how the music on this show progresses...

I think he's a comedic genius, with a sardonic, self-deprecating sense of humor that will put tears in your eyes.  Sedaris's books even are better listened to than read, as you'll get the full effect of the author's intent.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Like The Civil War by Burns, this brilliant 1970s series about WWII created a new style of documentary that has been endlessly copied but never equaled.    It blends unsurpassed dramatic narration (Olivier) with interviews of political and military figures, historians (Ambrose, Keegan), soldiers and civilians (Hitler's secretary), and rare archival footage.  It covers virtually all aspects of the war - the rise of Hitler, blitzkrieg, the battle of Britain, the war at Sea, North Africa, Stalingrad, Leningrad, Burma, the holocaust, the home fronts (Britain, America, France, Germany and Japan), the Bomb, MacArthur's island hopping, D-day, etc.      It effectively brings home the stunning breadth and destruction of the greatest conflict in history, costing the lives of over 50 million souls.
0452282152|5.0|Too often I have lamented that my gender cannot write, but Tracy Chevalier is the pearl in a haystack. It is an art to write a fascinating tale about a still scene on canvas. When in highschool in Germany, we also had to write a whole story found in a single painting. Carl Spitzweg made everyone of his scenes tell a story. Perhaps all painters tell a story in their picture. Tracy Ch. slips into the picture painted by Vermeer around 1660 and becomes the girl, whom she deems to be his maid. By looking at her profile, I disagree that she was a maid who married the butcher, her features are too fine; but it is the freedom of the writer to create a fiction about the girl. With all her housekeeping chores and detailed family life in Delft, Netherlands, the narration takes off well and never becomes boring; and I read every word. It is the literary art of Tracy Chevalier to stay focused on her simple subject and create a spell-binding book based on Vermeers old oil.

The two are undoubtedly similar. But that's why I purchased this CD - to prove myself wrong. I always knew that Cash was one of the most gifted story tellers of all time. Finding that connection is where the challenge comes into play. And although I liked a couple of tunes on his greatest hits album, it didn't do much for me. When I came across this album, I knew that this would make or break my taste for Cash's music. And as you can tell from my 5 star rating, I was completely blown away. The idea is simply unparalleled in the history of music. Cash visits a notoriously tough California penitentiary; a place where he had also been an inmate, to play for a crowd of 2000 convicted felons. The magic lies within his song choices. They all carried themes of prison, murder, crime, regret, loss, death, god, and hopelessness. Cash connects with the audience on a surreal level that is nothing short of magical. As he should, since he's lived through all of the anguish presented in the songs. This in turn makes his playing, story telling, and overall songs feel much warmer and personal.<br /><br />The three unreleased tracks that were added (\\"Busted\\", \\"Joe Bean\\", \\"The Legend of John Henry's Hammer\\") are fantastic additions that complete the full concert nicely. The album immediately grew on me with the album opener, \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\". The album is full of standouts, including \\"I Still Miss Someone\\", \\"Cocaine Blues\\", \\"25 Minutes to Go\\", \\"Long Black Veil\\", the comic relief of \\"Dirty Old Egg Sucking Dog\\", and \\"Jackson\\" among others.<br /><br />I find it somewhat disturbing that I dismissed Cash's talent for so long. I would whole-heartedly recommend this album to a non-fan of Johnny Cash. This album will always remain as a complete revelation in my eyes. Not only did it get me to love Johnny Cash, but it got my respect the genre of Country music more than I ever have before.ut it got my respect the genre of Country music more than I ever have before.

B000268QB2|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about getting this album. I had heard numerous comparisons to Coldplay, so I figured it meant that they were a lesser version, but I ended up buying it after I heard the big hit single, Somewhere Only We Know. That's still my favorite song on the album, but the rest of the album is far from disappointing. <br /> <br />I think the comparisons between Keane and Coldplay are a bit off. Yes, the two groups are somewhat similar in that they use pianos and hail from Britain, but that's about where the similarities end. The most obvious difference is that Keane is a 3 piece. There is no guitar, and the bass is dubbed in. I also feel that Keane has more genuine talent than Coldplay. Tom Chaplin is one of the best vocalists in recent memory. His voice is somewhat similar to his peers, but unlike them he sounds comfortable with the range. The piano playing by Tim Rice-Oxley is sometimes simple, but there are plenty of interesting and catchy songs here, and it sounds as if there is a lot of potential waiting to come out. The drumming isn't anything special, but it gets the job done. <br /> <br />The lyrics of Keane are nothing profound, but they more than get the job done. Chaplin has that rare quality of being able to get you to feel his words, whether you can relate personal experiences or not. I constantly hear lyrics and think, \\"I know exactly what he means.\\" In a world of bland, vague lyrics, this is a great quality to have. There isn't a lot of variety(most of the songs are about relationships), but the lyrics never sound stale. <br /> <br />The album opens with Somewhere Only We Know, which was a very good choice for a single. It's probably the most straight forward song on the album with mostly piano, and you'll probably be singing along not too long after you hear it. The lyrics are very simple and straight forward. 5/5 <br /> <br />The album's second track is This is the Last Time, which shows another side of the band. This song is about even between electronics and piano, and is probably just as catchy as the previous tracks. 5/5 <br /> <br />Bend and Break is the third track, and it's another one that is mostly piano. The chorus is magnificent and one of the album's highlights. One of my favorites on the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />The fourth track, We Might As Well Be Strangers, is quite different from the others. It's slower, and delivers the sort of melancholie that everyone needs once in a while. Another favorite. 5/5 <br /> <br />The fifth track is Everybody's Changing, which is another popular single. It's largely electronic, and sounds like the sort of thing that would have been a huge hit during the '80s. Very catchy. 5/5 <br /> <br />Your Eyes Open is the the six track on the album. It's another mixture of electronics and piano, but heavier on the electronics. Not one of my favorites, but it's still a good track. 5/5 <br /> <br />Hopes and Fears's seventh track is She Has No Time. It's another change from the usual. It's very slow, and it sounds a bit spacey and ambient on the verse, but the chorus is another one that soars. This probably has the single best vocal performance on the album during the chorus. 5/5 <br /> <br />Following that is Can't Stop Now, which is mostly piano. This song is good, but there's no significant change here, and earlier tracks did this better. My least favorite track on the album. 4/5 <br /> <br />Sunshine is the ninth track, and it is another slow song. This is another song that would've been at home in the eighties, and it's completely electronic. Not especially catchy, but it has a great minimalist intro, and is certainly interesting. 5/5 <br /> <br />Untitled1 is the tenth track on the album. It opens up with some very interesting drum work, and then some more spacy electronics come in. This song sounds very much like some of Radiohead's more melodic songs in recent years, but is still original. 5/5 <br /> <br />The album closes with Bedshaped. It starts out sounding very electronic, but once it gets past the intro some nice piano comes in on the verese. The chorus sounds very epic and somewhat similar to the Verve's Bittersweet Symphony. A great way to end the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />I don't really have any gripes with this album. If the first half of the album was too simplistic, the second half makes up for it with experimentation. I would say that Chaplin should play an instrument, but his vocals are great, and the dubbed in bass wasn't really necessary anyway. <br /> <br />It'll be interesting to see where this band goes after this album, but whether it's straightforward pop, futuristic electronic music, or a combination, I'll be interested in hearing it. While they aren't a great band yet, if they can keep it going they'll get there before too long.
0812550706|3.0|I hold true to the fact that non-geniouses can never write about one. But this book certainly came close.     I was impressed by many parts of this book, like the believeablity of the school, but i was also a little let down by some elements, such as the way children acted and the lack of descrpistion about one or two things.    I kept an open mind about the entire science fiction thing. I'm not a big fan of so much sci-fi in one dose. But the finer points of this book completely escaped me.    and it's okay for kids, if your escpeaclially worried about that, remember it's not real, and only an escpeically emotional child is going to really be affected by it. Oh, that's  abit harsh.      The voices in your head aren't real, but they have really great ideas.   -Happy Bunny Qoute
0385335997|5.0|Diana Gabaldon has regaled her readers with the passionate story of Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser in this (thus far) memorable series.  In Outlander, former WWII combat nurse and married woman Claire Randall is transported to Eighteenth Century Scotland where she meets highlander warrior Jamie Fraser and embarks upon a beautiful love affair that transcends time and boundaries.  In Dragonfly in Amber, twenty years had passed from her unique time-travel experience and she is now with Jamie's daughter, Brianna.  After her twentieth century husband dies, she goes back in time and tries to save Jamie from being killed in the battle of Culloden, which she fails to do -- or so she thinks.  In this third offering, Claire returns to the eighteenth century to recapture her romance with Jamie after discovering that he had survived the battle of Culloden.  While this happens, the reader gets a glimpse into what their lives had been like during the twenty years they were apart.  There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Voyager, like the previous two novels, is richly historical and beautifully narrated with precise details and romantic prose.  There are a number of new colorful characters in this one that I enjoyed very much.  I also got to read more insightful tales of Scottish and other European history.  The historical references fascinated me, especially the ones centered on the Scottish Highlands.  I also found the storylines centered on voodoo to be quite compelling and intriguing.  And of course I enjoyed reading about what are now one of my all-time favorite fictional couples in literature.  This love story that transcends time is truly captivating.  These two characters speak to me in a whole unique way.  I like the scenes that some readers deem disturbing and dark, like the ones centered on corporal punishment.  This is one of the areas in which the author is keeping true to the times, for corporal punishment was quite common in those times.  Also, there are complaints that the book is sometimes boring because of its large length.  This novel did not feel long to me at all.  After reading almost nine-hundred pages (trade paperback) I felt as though the book hadn't been long enough.  I hated to see it end.  Voyager is my favorite novel of this series thus far.  I cannot wait to give Drums of Autumn a whirl.  Outlander fans must simply read this third offering.  And for others who are new to the series, I recommend that you read these books in order.  Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber precede this one.  Enjoy!e are complaints that the book is sometimes boring because of its large length.  This novel did not feel long to me at all.

B000777J2S|5.0|The first time one listens to Antony's prodigious voice it takes a long while to assign it a place in the espectrum we have grown used to judge music by. Past that mere moment of contemplation there is nothing more than awe and bliss to describe what \\"I am bird now\\" provokes. If there is more than one \\"big name\\" listed on the credit sheet, it is his staggering whisper that carries on an album so intense and hard to digest that it becomes a classic from the moment one opens the shrinkwarp. Loneliness never sounded so poignant as in opener \\"Hope there's someone\\", while the craving for acceptance  finds its way throuhg the nostalgic 'For today I'm a boy\\", just like the plea for hope and even a future materializes as the spoken track \\"Free at last\\". If I were to pick the highlights of the album, the obvious choices would be 'Fistful of love\\" with its impressive horn section and an introduction by Lou Reed that makes anyone turn pale, and the incredible duet with Boy George (\\"You are my sister\\"), which will certainly send shivers down your spine. <br />Much have been said and writen about raw talent, but when one gets to experience it first hand is just mindblowing. Forget the overly produced record and embrace purity with a touch of glitter. <br />

You get three hours of classic Eagles music with some newer stuff by Glenn Frey and Don Henley. I also like the \\"feel\\" of this concert DVD - you can tell your getting a solid professional production from start to finish. Finally, you can't beat the price - thirty great songs performed live for 20+ bucks..
B000003BDJ|5.0|I was looking for this when I picked up Forty Licks, looking back I think I should've gotten this instead but oh well. As opposed to Forty Licks, which had a bit of filler, every song here is classic. Personal favorites include Jumping Jack Flash, Sympathy for the Devil, Play with Fire, Paint It Black, Ruby Tuesday, Let's Spend the Night Together, Street Fighting Men, Gimme Shelter, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Wild Horses, Brown Sugar and virtually anything else. Every song here scores in the good-to-great range, the worst (Not like it's saying much) being As Tears Go By, Heart of Stone and Time Is on My Side.<br />Every compilation has missing songs. In this case, Let It Bleed, Sway, No Expectations, the Last Time, Jigsaw Puzzle and Little Red Rooster have been cruly omitted. If you want the best Stones package there is, get this. But if you want an overview, Forty Licks. It just depends on who you are.

Those of you diggin the disc should check out Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  My entire listening experience has been wrecked by this marketing ploy.

1563890410|5.0|This is what comics are supposed to be: thoughtful, well-drawn, and entertaining. The Sandman series stands above most other comics, and this collection stands above most other Sandman work.<br /><br />Referring to an earlier story, the Sandman realizes that he has made a mistake, and caused immense pain to someone who never deserved it. He sets out to correct his error, not that anything will take back the pain already inflicted. That's when all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />I mean literally. Not with Bam! Pow! fight scenes, but with delicate and varied art, with invocations of many mythologies, and with Gaiman's ability to put another twist into any plot. The final surprise, this time, is at least one more miscarriage of justice, maybe several, but perhaps in the name of a higher justice. Resolution is as ironic as it is inevitable, and not quite satisfactory in any way. Well, solutions to complex problems never are.<br /><br />This volume collect several of the original comics, each drawn by different art teams. That's especially effective in this collection, and adds to the dreamlike shifting quality of the story. P. Craig Russell's art in one episode is especially enjoyable. McKean's cover art and other odd bits contribute their own elusiveness to the total.<br /><br />The series of Sandman collections read well in order, and almost as well out of order. If you're new to the Sandman, this might be a great place to start. It stands well by itself, and shows just how good this series can be.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002C25|3.0|When Be Here Now was first released, it was greeted with generally favorable reviews in the British press - it actually scored a point higher than its predecessor, (What's the Story) Morning Glory, in the New Musical Express. Over the next few months, the general consensus worsened steadily, and the album went from being hailed as a worthy successor to being considered a general disappointment before finally being relegated to punch-line status, where it has remained ever since. Since 1998, Be Here Now has served as shorthand for music journalists when discussing worst-case scenarios for follow-up albums. If one were to base his or her opinion on this album solely from references to it in the British press over the last eight years, without having ever actually listened to it, they would be justified in considering it not only the low point of Oasis's career, but of the last twenty years of rock. Which is ridiculous. Be Here Now is half great and half...    First, the good. The album's opener, \\"D'You Know What I Mean,\\" is one of the finest examples of modern psychedelic rock, and was a gutsy choice for a first single. Two of the songs that served as singles, \\"Don't Go Away\\" and \\"Stand By Me,\\" are quite simply perfect and can stand up alongside any other Oasis classic. \\"All Around the World\\"'s only fault is being too much of a good thing - Noel was really pushing it with the nine minute running length, but he wanted to write the definitive Oasis epic and in that sense he succeeded. The last great track is \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know,\\" which, for some odd reason, no one ever talks about. It's never mentioned by Oasis fans and to the best of my knowledge has never been performed in concert.    And then the rest. With the exception of \\"I Hope, I Think, I Know,\\" the good songs on Be Here Now have the pristine production values of (What's the Story), and their clean sounds complement their pop and ballad qualities. The rest of Be Here Now suffers from what must be the worstproduction of any superstar rock album to be released in the last fifteen years. At the time of its recording, Noel was still caught in the whirlwind of going from poor and anonymous the most famous multi-millionaire in Britain, was inhaling cocaine and oxygen in equal amounts, and was regularly being feted as the greatest songwriting genius since Lennon. As you might imagine, all this went to his head. The resultant egomania is plainly manifested in the average amount of guitar tracks per song. Whereas the previous albums had contained judiciously deployed guitar double-tracking, Be Here Now sounds like it was recorded on an infinity-track. If the sound of Definitely Maybe was that of the best live rock band on the planet, the sound of Be Here Now is that of a thousand aspiring rock gods playing every instrument in every section of Guitar Center in the ultimate battle for ROCK SUPREMACY! This is the first Oasis album to have unlistenable moments. (But not the last!) However, were the rockers on this album stripped down, they might actually be kind of good. Not great, and still way too long, but kind of good.     Since its release, every subsequent Oasis album has been hailed as a \\"return to form,\\" as if Be Here Now were an anomalous detour into acoustic bluegrass and every album following was right back to traditional rock. The double irony here is that Be Here Now was the LAST real Oasis album, and every subsequent album has been an ever FURTHER abandonment of the original Oasis ethic. I mean this in the best possible way, but all of the best Oasis songs are basically the same - simple chord progressions, Noel's nimble lead, and an anthemic chorus. You'll find more of those on Be Here Now and its b-sides than you will on the last three albums combined.    Don't be dissuaded by its rep. Be Here Now is only half-great, but that's ten times better than what you've been lead to believe.

B000AA4LAK|5.0|Hot Fuss was already an exceptional album, and the addition of these three previously unreleased tracks adds to it's appeal. <br /> <br />The hits \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" and \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" alone make the album worth buying if you don't already own the 2004 edition of \\"Hot Fuss.\\" The original 12 songs are catchy and fun, especially the sexy-sounding \\"On Top\\" and poppish \\"Change Your Mind,\\" as well as the fascinating songs of murderous jealousy, \\"Jenny\\" and \\"Midnight Show.\\" <br /> <br />Those of you who already own \\"Hot Fuss\\" and enjoy it will be glad to have the three additional songs. <br /> <br />\\"Glamorous Indie Rock 'n' Roll\\" is a sarcastic jab at people who say The Killers have sold out due to the popularity of their music. Despite the heavy sarcasm, it is sung in a way that sounds almost like over-the-top sincerity. It is not simply a jab at snobbish indie rock fans - it is a wonderful song in itself. <br /> <br />\\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" has an interesting sound and even more interesting lyrics, although it doesn't quite catch one's attention as well as the two other newly added songs. <br /> <br />\\"Under The Gun\\" is a short but sweet song. It tells the story of a fatal car crash, an angel \\"with a criminal mind,\\" and the man she left behind. This has got to be the catchiest song ever written in which the chorus is a repetition of the line, \\"Kill me now!\\" <br /> <br />To make a long story short, YES, the three added songs are worth buying this limited edition CD! <br /> <br />

B00008YJH5|5.0|Pixies' album Surfer Rosa is definitely one of the best albums ever released.  It's probably, along with Doolittle, the Pixies' defining moment and greatest triumph.   This is where the alternative rock invented by R.E.M. and Husker Du was mixed with Frank Black's noise and dynamics to give birth to the beast that the mainstream coined as alternative in the 1990's (Nirvana mercilessly ripped off both Husker Du and the Pixies...listen to those two great bands and then listen to any Nirvana song...see what I mean?).  Surfer Rosa opens with the savage Bone Machine, which has some of the best sounding drums I've ever heard on record...the magic of Steve Albini's production.  Song after song are just awesome....River Euphrates, Where is My Mind?, Broken Face, Gigantic, Break My Body....it just goes on and on.  You owe it to yourself to check this album out.  And then the rest of the Pixies' catalog.  One of the most underrated and overlooked bands of the 1980's, and also one of the most important.

0967851408|5.0|A friend first sent me this book about two years ago.  I was delighted to see as I read that wisdom as expressed by C.F. Haanel is actually ancient wisdom of multi-cultures.  It is facinating to note that much of what he expresses are from aboriginal as well as oriental cultures.  His depth of knowledge is remarkable.  The exercises scientifically back up what many people have thought to be mysterious or magic.  His way of teaching is easy to follow.  The exercises very astute.  Anyone who is interested in awakening the power of the mind, reaching their own path to enlightenment and deeper success would be well advised to read the entire series.  Nothing works however unless you do so be prepared to apply the laws of the universe.
0380715430|1.0|This book is certainly amusing. It's very enjoyable for a novice to read.     But, as many others have pointed out, every page is just error after factual error. Bryson simply does not understand how languages work, and whatever his sources are are frequently wrong. My favorite mistake is when he claims that in Finnish, there is only one swear word, ravintolassa, meaning \\"in the restaurant\\" (page 214). Now, ravintolassa DOES mean \\"in the restaurant,\\" but that's ALL it means. Finnish has plenty of native swear words (saatana, perkele, vittu, jumalauta, and more), and I still cannot imagine how Bryson came to the conclusion that, not only did it have only one, but that it was the word for \\"in the restaurant.\\" It's truly mind-boggling.    Among my other favorite errors are when he says that \\"Estimates of the number of languages in the world usually fix on a figure of about 2,700\\" (page 37; all estimates I've ever seen generally give between 5,000 and 6,000). Or when he completely misunderstands the concept of case affixes when discussing Finnish (page 35; he seems to think that the various words created are utterly unanalyzable to the speakers. By analogy, then, English speakers would need to learn the plural word \\"cats\\" separately from the singular \\"cat,\\" rather than simply extending their knowledge of the plural suffix -s to the word \\"cat.\\" Bryson fails to make the rather important distinction between \\"word\\" and \\"root\\").     He also buys the extremely controversial arguments of people like Merritt Ruhlen and presents them as complete fact (\\"Recent studies of cognates...have found possible links between some of those must unlikely language parteners: for instance, between Basque and Na-Dene...and between Finnish and Eskimo-Aleut. No one has come up with a remotely plausible explanation of how a language spoken only in a remote corner of the Pyrenees could have come to influence Indian languages of the New World, but the links between many cognates are too numerous toexplain in terms of simple coincidence\\" -- page 24). There hardly exists a serious linguist in the world who would agree with that statement.     And of course there is the famous \\"Eskimo\\" Words for Snow Myth, which results in large part from a total misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages (page 14).    Unfortunately, many of the errors Bryson makes are much harder to catch, in that they involve concepts (such as his apparent conviction that English is somehow unique among languages in its expressiveness and form...he also ironically says on page 17 that \\"most books on English imply in one way or another that our language is superior to all others\\"), rather than factual claims, since incorrect facts are easier to refute.    Throughout the book, Bryson repeatedly makes these types of inexcusable factual and conceptual errors, and as a result paints an inaccurate and deceptive picture of languages and linguistics in general. For this reason, I take issue with the reviewers who say that what matters is that the book is entertaining negates its errors. On the contrary, the entire point of the book is to tell the story of the English language, and Bryson, as a good writer who knows how to inject good humor into his work, makes it funny. But a the true purpose remains to educate people, and it fails miserably in this respect, and as a result, it fails as a whole. Adding humor cannot make a bad book into a good one.
B00005JKG7|4.0|As a kid of 12 or 13, I remember watching the fog and having the be-jeezus scared out of me. The creepy atmosphere, the soundtrack, and those leprous ghosts hiding in the shadows was just enough to cause a sleepless night or two. So as a Horror fan, I had to buy myself a copy.<br /><br />This was John Carpenter's second film, following right on the heels of \\"Halloween.\\" And it was a tough movie for him to make. Not only was the pressure on to follow that movie up, but Carpenter wanted to make something completely different - an old fashioned ghost story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, upon viewing the finished product, he hated it; it just didn't work. So at the last minute, they reshot a few scenes and added some additional gore and close ups. And \\"The Fog\\" the I know and love was born.<br /><br />On this DVD you get the widescreen on one side and the standard full television screen version on the other. You also get two documentaries regarding the film, one done in 1980, and the other done just for this DVD. Both are well done and detail the problems the crew faced bringing this story to the screen. I have yet to look for the easter egg, but I'll give it a try.<br /><br />This film is also great for the involvement of special effects guru Rob Bottin. While \\"The Fog\\" came early in his career, it showed what he was capable of. His other films include \\"The Howling,\\"The Thing,\\" \\"Robocop,\\" and \\"Se7en\\" to name a few on his impressive resume. Now I admit, Blake didn't have much of a speaking role, and for the most part he stayed in the shadows, but he was Bottin's creation, and that spooky image has stuck in my mind for all those years!<br /><br />It's not a very long movie, but if you're in the mood for a good old fashioned ghost story with more than a few scares, give \\"The Fog\\" a try.
1400095913|3.0|A great character, a wonderful premise.  Unfortunately, the resolution was simply not believable.  All battered children do not turn into psychopathic monsters, and Dexter's seemingly mystical ability to \\"see\\" what was going on the killer's mind was much too pat. Maybe the next one will be better, but I'm going to wait for the paperback.
6305313687|5.0|The characters are three-dimensional, something rather rare in film and seemingly unheard of in films with themes of racial tensions.  It is not a short movie, but the plot moves very well, you will never be bored.  Edward Norton is riveting and believable in the lead role.  A movie that does not offer simple, easy answers.
B000002I99|5.0|this is alice coopers number cd. what it dose is bring you in to alice coopers world of shockrock type music. its scary and funny but mostly scary. so if you are over 10 years old i recomend it. if you are 8 years to 10 you should skip a couple tracks because of some explict lyrics or creepy lyricks. if you are under 8 stick to your kitty music about elfs trust me you will be scared anf=d you will ask questions about stuff that your parents dont want you to ask untill your older. plesent dreams
B0009A40ES|4.0|A parody of the 80's movie that got a lot of press over the vulgar manner it was presented, especially towards women that should completely be negelected. <br /> <br />Enjoy the movie for what it is, a very creative and eyebrow raising look at our fascination with serial killers and the vibe of the 80's presented in a very original manner.  Similar to the feel and vibe of Natural Born Killers for the 90's.  Acting and direction was great and flowed very well, especially in the un-cut version. <br /> <br />Enter this movie with the right frame of mind and you will enjoy it and get the message originally intended in the very controversial book.
B00000896R|4.0|When I first bought this (being suprised to find his solo stuff in the US) I didn't appreciate it.  Over the past few years it has grown on me - I really love Business and On My Way Up.  The Guv'nor is and Cyborg are good rocking songs, but the second one mostly strikes me as strange.  I love the \\"strange\\" Queen songs, but the songs from Queen II have a certain feel (drug-induced, possibly) that isn't repeated in Cyborg.  I don't care for China Belle or All the Way From Memphis at all, though I think it is more personal preference than quality of song. <br /> <br />I have no complaints of Brian's vocal ability on this album (as people have criticized him on other albums) and there are at least 2 great songs on it.  If you have run out of Queen to buy, I would definately recommend this.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|A great psychological thriller but not all that original, you realize early on that he is psychosymatic but still a great story line regardless.<br /><br />Christian Bales physical change for the role is almost worth the price of the movie itself.  I was not a Christian Bale fan prior (even knowing he would be in Batman) but this role showed what a great actor he can be.<br /><br />A very pleasant surprise for fans of movies like Momento, Barton Fink, Secret Window, and the Gimli Hospital.  Higly recommended by a tough critic.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|that was am empty threat, but never the less youo should see this movie, it is, to qoute my best friend, \\"FREAKIN SWEAT!!\\" Im 15, and the animated CGI blah blah blah genre usually doesnt appeal to me but this movie is by far the best one of its kind ive ever seen, i loved it. With McGreggor and Robin Williams in it i coulndt turn away so i went and saw it, i loved it so much that i saw it 3 more times!! and i still wanted to see it again. It mocks brittany Spears, Big Buissness, and well everything else, what more could you want? Its the best ive ever seen...
B00005IC2H|1.0|After hearing this band often grouped together with Godspeed You Black Emperor! I decided to give this CD a spin and was rather disappointed.  None of these songs don't seem to go faster than 40 bpm and make me lose interest rather easily.  What Sigur Ros forgot to do that Godspeed does is make the music go somewhere after a while, maybe increasing tempos or changing timbres.  This band kinda goes for a cheap shot to please the critics by making it slow but beautifully intense, giving the listener the kind of romantic feeling of ecstacy that music critics often exagerate about with albums.  For another example of this, check out My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\", which I would rather listen to than this. This CD does make me feel like I'm drifing through the glacial wasteland of the band's native Iceland, but the feeling leaves me cold and bored. If this band actually rocked out, they could pump out some really sweet tunes, but this is the one CD out of my 200 or so that I am completely displeased with.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The Marshall Mathers LP may be Eminem's best album. In this album, Eminem does more of the same, persay, but better. This album, with a darker, more depressing mood, shows no signs of weakness. Though strong, I find 'Kim' to have little to no ryming value on this album. Eminem basically starts out saying that he doesn't care what you think.  <br /> <br />My Picks on this album would be: <br />Marshall Mathers <br />Stan <br />Criminal <br />Bitch Please II <br />I'm Back <br /> <br />In the song 'Marshall Mathers', Eminem explains the brutal truth that he doesn't want to have to through being famous. <br />'Stan' depics a desressed fan who tries to write to Eminem, but to no avail. In the end, Stan, the writer, commits homicide and suicide while making a tape. The tape never gets out, because it goes over the bridge with Stan and his girlfriend. Eminem finally gets back, but realises he saw Stan's case on the new. This is one of his best songs, it depics his talent. <br />'Criminal' is a twisted and funny song with true talent that shows as Eminem explains his grudge and life. (Kenneth M. Jackson \\"Kenn J.\\"'s review) <br />In 'Bitch Please II', Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and Eminem all rap about how strong they are and how their careers cause them to suffer. Pretty good lyrical value, including Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg preforming the short, but nice chorus. <br />In 'I'm Back' Eminem annouces his return, in a violent way. He descirbes how he claims to have gotten the name 'Slim Shady.' Regardless, he tells more about his life and drugs, true slim material.  <br />The rest of the album is also really well done. I'd recomend picking it up if you haven't already.  <br /> <br />5/5 Stars, #1 Eminem Album - AJ
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|In the heart of many worldwide, of the great genius that Ray was.<br /><br />When he faded into sickness and then finally passed it meant the passing of a legend, an end of an era.<br /><br />Because for over 40 years Ray Charles had been at the forefront of RnB music. He showed off many styles and is remembered for his classic originality and spirit.<br /><br />The album will make you cry, laugh and groove, really every emotion and that is what Ray does well.<br /><br />\\"Here We Go Again\\" features the amazing Norah Jones, another genius. The effortless vocals, the superb melody harnesses the listener and entrances with superiority.<br /><br />The song is amazing as it decieves the listener at times, however it is a great song.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" is a nice breezy song that is so lovely to listen to the way they utilise each others voice to create an amazing harmony. James Taylor is the guest on this track.<br /><br />A singer who I have always really been fond of, without being much of a fan is Diana Krall. Krall guests on the next track.<br /><br />\\"You Don't Know Me\\" is a very exquisite track and very calming.<br /><br />With nurturing melodies and Diana's voice it is an immediate favourite.<br /><br />\\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" is another classic that has re-surfaced for this recording and the original singer, Elton John joins Ray for one monster duet. How much bigger could a duet get. The vocals are raw and the instruments are superb.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" features the saucy Natalie Cole and is one steamy song. What a ripper!

0898159156|5.0|This was the first book I purchased on CPs, as it came highly recommended.  It is a definate necessity for anyone just starting to grow CPs.  The book is entertaining to read (it won't put you to sleep) and the information is well organized.  I read the entire book in less than a week and still refer to it often. <br /> <br />This book breaks down into chapters the different species of CPs and then goes on to give physical descriptions, temperature requirements, and the like for every plant it covers.  It has a great section on growing CPs in general wherin soil types and ingredients are discussed as well as other important topics like water, diseases & pests, etc. <br /> <br />If you are a beginner in the world of CPs or even if you don't plan on growing them but would just like to learn about them, this book is my number one choice for you.
B0000640VN|4.0|Although this movie is sadly predictable, and the stars fail to shine, this movie still manages to be enjoyable.  I really don't understand how or why, but it does.  The time traveling part of the storyline is about the same caliber as that which is found in the Martin Lawrence film \\"Black Knight.\\" <br /> <br />I wasn't overly impressed with Meg Ryan's role.  I feel her performance was more developed and appeared less scripted in films such as \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" or \\"You've got Mail.\\"  Hugh Jackman did give a fairly decent performance, and definitely carried the film.  However, I believe both stars fell victims to being confined to an underdeveloped script. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a decent romantic comedy.  I would recommend renting this movie, but definitely not buying it.  You will want to watch this movie once or twice, but that will probably be about it.   <br />
B000084T18|1.0|Well done, 0.50 Cent and MTV, and all other coons, you've just put a C into rap.
B000068CNX|5.0|It's amazing how many people will take time to write such a hateful review of a TV show.  I can understand doing it once for a single show, maybe twice, but some (Diogenes) review many of the Friends products just to insult those that do enjoy the show.  I find that those who tend not to like the show are the ones that eat alone at lunch, constantly talking about not conforming yet conform to be a typical outsider basically another form of conforming.  It is ok we all get it.  We know why you truly hate friends...its jealousy.  While you may brag that you love your life of being an intellect, not watching \\"mindless dribble\\" you forget to allow yourself to be entertained.  Now if friends is not your cup of tea (or coffee) then fine, don't watch, buy, or acknowledge the show.  Write a bad review of the show...who cares...good for you.  I'm sure you and your internet \\"girlfriend\\" can get big laughs out of it.  I know you're trying to change how people view the show, by creating a world of \\"free thinkers\\". You sure changed my mind. I never knew how mindless friends was and I could not be happier that I have you to think for me.   <br /> <br />As for season 2, great season...funny moments as all have. <br />
6305949980|4.0|One of the Halloween, Christmas classics. Maybe a little scary for very young kids, but our whole family enjoys it every time we view it. The kids have memorized all the songs. <br /> <br />The documentary on how night mare was made is fascinating to watch. you really appreciate the movie more, knowing the amount of work required to create this great flik! Loved it!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I write this review with the perscpective of a teenager who is fairly knowledgable about The Beatles, but is a relatively new fan. Some who read this review may know nothing about The Beatles at all, while others are thouroughly analyzing each and every edit EMI has made when remastering the tracks for this album. Personally, I'm not terribly concerned with such things, and I assume much of the general public isn't either. However, I can't speak for The Beatles fans who are interested in extreme technicalities, not there is anything wrong with that.  <br /> <br />Basically, this album drew me in to The Beatles at a young age. This CD is what inspired me to purchase more of The Beatles music as I soon fell in love with them after listening to this disc. I beleive this was a large portion of EMI's goal when releasing the album, to draw in more young fans. Now that I've come more aqquainted with The Beatles' music, there are certain songs I wish would have come with this package. However, you've got to understand that choosing songs for a Beatles Hits album is roughly like... a jelly bean enthusiast trying to only choose 27 jelly beans out of a very large jar. He loves them all, and there are so many different colours and flavours it's almost impossible for him to choose. If you tried to choose the songs based on one person's opinion or even a large group of people's opinion, the arguing would be endless over what qualifies as one of the great Beatles songs worthy of being on the hits album. So, probably the fairest way is to say \\" What songs actually went number one?\\" After all, there are over twenty of them. While you could still argue that some of the best Beatles songs weren't even released as singles, this album represents a pretty fair way to present the best of The Beatles to new generations, and old fans, in one single convenient package. That being said, the song selection presented one the album is enjoyable. It's not exactly an accurate anthology of The Beatles entire career (interestingly, there aren't any songs from Sgt. Pepper!) all the songs here are good songs, while I enjoy some a lot better than others. (I was never a big fan of The Ballad Of John And Yoko...) On the technical side, which I don't know an immense amount about, I find the remastered stereo versions of these songs to make practically ancient songs like Love Me Do come alive like never before. While I could have easily seen this collection coming with a nice thick CD booklet archiving The Beatles rise to fame, you are given a rather small but practical one that tells what album each single is from (and precisely when it went number one, and in which country) and an assortment of some of The Beatles' old photos.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this CD is best for introducing The Beatles to a younger generation, and also for old Beatles fans on a limited budget and not enough money to immediatley purchase ALL of The Beatles' complete albums. Or you give this disc to your son or daughter as a gift and they will most likely be a Beatles fan for life. <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|This one does follow the comics with no comprimises. If you like Miller's work buy this one.  I can only hope that the \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" is made into a movie. I'd love to see a \\"directed by Frank Miller\\" on that one!
0920668372|5.0|After I had my son 7 years ago, a neighbor gave me this book. To this day I cannot read it without crying. I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I have just recently given this book to my niece after she had her first baby. It was a boy. This is a wonderful book.
B000957O82|3.0|Why, you say?  Because the movie serves as a list of actual information to men about what to do, or not to do if they want to have a good chance with women, or increase their percentage of success at least.  As always, Will Smith is charming to no end and only helps men who really like women.  This film has gotten some great reviews from friends of mine who think it's a very good film and while I understand why they feel that way (it's one of the best that have come out in awhile and it doesn't feel tired, or like a retread) but I still find the conventions of this genre annoying.  As much as I enjoyed the relationship between Alex Hitchens and whatever her name was, I couldn't help but know that the writers had to throw a contrived obstacle in the way when it isn't really necessary.  For instance, Will Smith's character, Hitch, helps men who trip over themselves get their foot in the door with women and that's all, he's not a relationship counselor, he's a date doctor and I think the movie unfairly tags al
B00068NVI4|5.0|I Just finished watching this DVD, and all I can say is outstanding!  <br /> <br />I've heard many complaints about the audio, and I have to wonder what kind of system these people are using! The DTS track played through my Sony home theater system sounded like I was actually at the show! Excellent! <br /> <br />I was really happy to hear \\"Show Me\\"! I've only heard this song once before when I saw Yes in Auburn Hills, Michigan on 5/8/2004, and since this song isn't on any albums, I would have bought this DVD just for this song! <br /> <br />I really hope Yes decides to release more DVD's. I'd really like to see footage from the \\"Union\\", \\"Talk\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\" tours! <br /> <br />Songs From Tsongas: Worth every penny in my opinion! <br /> <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|Just like most kids at an early age, the music I heard that shaped my musical tastes was mostly provided by my parent's record collection.  All I have to say is, thank God my dad was an enormous Beatles fan.  I can remember watching the animated Yellow Submarine movie, wearing Beatles t-shirts, and even going to see Paul McCartney live at RFK Stadium in D.C. - all this by the time I was five years old.  Of course I didn't \\"get\\" everything about this album at the time, but albums like Revolver have been on my playlist for basically my entire life - and that's saying something.  A perennial favorite on critics' best-of lists and essential albums guides, Revolver was a major landmark in the Beatles career. <br /> <br />Of course, it helps that 14 out of 14 tracks were complete and utter gems.  My least favorite track is \\"Doctor Robert\\", which is still a nicely-riffed, well written ode to John Lennon's personal medicine man - everything else here is no less than transcendent.  If you had to choose one album to show what the Beatles were capable of, this is it.  It almost encompasses as many styles of music as the White Album in 1/2 the number of songs - keeping it crisp, concise, and a great listen start to finish. <br /> <br />Revolver's strengths are numerous - first and foremost, the songwriting is impeccable.  George Harrison makes some ace contributions here, especially the scathing classic rock staple \\"Taxman,\\" and Lennon and McCartney each play to their own strengths.  As a generalization, Lennon's songs are much harder-rocking here, and Paul's are a bit more restrained.  Now, that doesn't make Paul's contributions any less interesting or trippy, in fact \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is one of the finest examples of outside-the-box pop songcraft of all time.  The lyrics (to which Ringo is said to have contributed a line or two) are brilliant and evocative, and George Martin's string arrangements are spot-on.  Speaking of George Martin, his production reached a zenith here withthe thunderous drums and tape loops of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and the neo-soul brass on \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\"  Not a track sounds dated, it's all timeless music that could have come from any era. <br /> <br />This album, and the Beatles in general, have influenced so many artists and had such a lasting impact on popular culture as a whole.  A number of awesome indie rock bands almost owe their entire existence to mid and late-period Beatles albums - think Cotton Mather, Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, and more - in fact, I'm sure there's THOUSANDS more.  Even if you are not personally a fan of the Beatles or any of the bands I just mentioned, you owe it to yourself to give Revolver at least a dozen spins before formulating an opinion.  Chances are you'll love it. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br />\\"Taxman\\" - Criticing British public officials by name and featuring a searing Paul McCartney guitar solo, this makes a strong case for George Harrison's songwriting.  Great main riff too. <br />\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" - One of the all-time best examples of lyrical mood matching the somber tone of the instrumentation.  Not a rock song by any means, but a great spotlight piece on a rock album. <br />\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" - Revolver opens with 3 unique songs by 3 different songwriters, and all are gems.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a drowsy Lennon tune features another great guitar solo, this one played backwards courtesy of George. <br />\\"She Said She Said\\" - Psychedelic, eerie, and amazing melody to boot.  The title is based on the drugged-out ramblings of Peter Fonda that John was subjected to at a party. <br />\\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" - Ringo plays one of the heaviest drum beats known to man over random screeching tape loops while John melodically reads passages from the Tibetan Book of the Dead.  Heavy metal?  Power pop? A precursor to indie rock?  Pure experimentalist existential noise?  All of the above, and more.
B000002TQV|5.0|When Pablo Honey was released & Creep was an unexpected top 20 UK hit, many people thought that Radiohead would dissapear as quickly as Creep was a hit, but boy how wrong they were!!!! because with The Bends Radiohead not only made one of the great albums of the 1990's but one of the great albums of all time, yes, I really mean it, it's that damn good!!!! <br /> <br />Whilst Pablo Honey was a typical Indie/Grunge album of its time 1995's The Bends had everything, from rock Planet Telex, The Bends, to Indie High & Dry, Fake Plastic Tree's, to grunge My Iron Lung. The Bends is a journey & by the time Street Spirit (Fade Out) has finished, you might not have realised at first, but you've just listened to something f**k@ing special!!! <br /> <br />This album would lead to the commercial breakthrough OK Computer, which was even more alternative, and nearly as brilliant. But for sheer quality & brilliance Radiohead have yet, and probably never will top The Bends. I don't only recommend this album to you, I suggest you buy it all all costs & any cost, it's that damn good!!!!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This film is fantastic.  It's full of mystery and kept my interest right up until the credits.  It's about a man named Oh Dae-su, who lives with his wife and  daughter.  He is kidnapped and later wakes up to find himself in a private makeshift prison. Dae-su wonders what made someone hate him so much enough to imprison him without any reason.  While imprisoned, Dae-su hears on the TV news that his wife was murdered.  Dae-su swears to take revenge on the person who destroyed his happy life.  Fifteen years later, he is released with a wallet filled with money and a mobile phone. An unknown man calls Dae-su and asks him to figure out why he was imprisoned.  The story then unfolds into an incredible and shocking tale of revenge.  This movie is an absolute must-see.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer would be Radiohead's major comercial breakthrough & although not as good as its predecessor the classy & essential The Bends, it still was a brilliant album, and saw the band venture even more into experimenting. Think of the music like combining the trip hop of Massive Attack combined with classic rock & Indie, and there you have OK Computer!!!! <br /> <br />The album opens with the classy Airbag, before the big hit single Paranoid Android gets into motion. Exit Music (for a film) is a beautiful slow tune, one of the best on the album, whilst Let Down is similar but more up beat. Karma Police continues the quality of songs, one of my personal Radiohead songs, it starts up beat before going slow but then going up beat again, great song. Fitter Happier can be best described like a tea break, this is the time when you get your coffee's teas, cokes, but it goes great with the sintilizing Electioneering, a boom bast rock song, perhaps the heaviest thing Radiohead have ever done. Climbing up the Walls is kinda dark, like Joy Division stuff, but add Thom Yorke's blazy lyrics & you have something very different. No Surprises & Lucky are perhaps the most well known songs on the album, whilst The Tourist ends the album on a somber yet masterful note!!! <br /> <br />Still reading???  <br /> <br />Well I suggest you go out to your nearest music store (if you have the money, if not save up!!!) & buy this along with The Bends, I mean what's the worst that can happen??? I mean you actually can stun your friends next time you see them because you really do listen to top quality music, so get off your bike then!!!!
B000001E7T|4.0|I still think this is one of the best albums PJ Harvey has even made to date. The sound, the tone, everything on it is great. <br /> <br />1. TO BRING YOU MY LOVE. - Not my favorite. In fact I frequently skip over this song. The lyrics are quite haunting, maybe a bit too haunting. <br /> <br />2. MEET ZE MONSTA - Probably my 2nd favorite song on the album. I love it. Her voice, the guitars, everything about this song will just get you pumped up. I don't know why, but usually when I'm mad at a significant other, I catch myself putting this song on instantly. <br /> <br />3. WORKING FOR THE MAN - \\"I'm just working for the man..\\" Another good song on the album. Dark, Dreary, and PJ's voice is haunting in this song also. <br /> <br />4. C'MON BILLY - This song has a country guitar sound to it.  PJ's voice is very powerful in this song. She pours out her heart in this song, and does it well. <br /> <br />5. TECLO - A 'different' start to this song, it takes you a while to get use to this song, but when you do, you can't help but repeat \\"let me ride on his grace for a while\\". <br /> <br />6. LONG SNAKE MOAN - Another song that I usually skip over. I don't know, it seems to alot of others favorite. It falls in the category with \\"To Bring you my love\\".  <br /> <br />7. DOWN BY THE WATER - Another one of my personal favorites. She sings about protecting her daughter from the earthly sins. My favorite part of the song is the insert from the Captain Beefheart song. <br /> <br />8. I THINK I'M A MOTHER - A long guitar start to this song, as well as some other instruments. It's hard to understand what PJ is saying in some parts of the song. Her voice is extremely deep in this song.  <br /> <br />9. SEND HIS LOVE TO ME - My favorite of the entire album. I love the lyrics, how she longs for the man that she loves. \\"I'm begging Jesus, please...send his love to me\\". If you are just becoming a PJ Harvey song, I'd recommend you listen to this song first. <br /> <br />10. THE DANCER -Probably my 3rd favorite. I love the laid back sound of this song. I could imagine just listening to this song, and swaying back and forth on a dancefloor.
B000006045|5.0|Although they had shown glimpses of dark in their previous 1994 release Protection Mezzanine was Massive Attack's official movement into darkness. This time the female vocalists were Elisabeth Fraser & Sara Jay. Mezzanine would also go on and become the groups first UK number 1 album, and would establish them as the undisbuted kings of Trip Hop (like Blue Lines & Mezzanine hadn't already prooved that, but such is the way with the critics) <br /> <br />The album goes straight into dark with the fab. though Angel, it would also be the first song that Massive Attack would use an electric guitar in their song, and remains one of their most popular songs. Risingson goes into familar rap territory but instead has a dark feel to it (much like most of the album actually) whilst Teardrop is a haunting melody performed by Fraser. Interior Creeps is another well known song on the album, whilst Exchange is a haunting yet beautiful instrumental (latter reprised at the end of the album). Dissolved Girl is quite a well known song, and the intro has been used for a lot of advertisement commercials. Man next Door has Dempsey on vocals for this dark soul tune, whilst Black Milk see's Fraser on vocals for this quite soft yet at times disturbing melody. The rap song Mezzanine continues in the dark, whilst Group Four see's Fraser on vocals again but this time including a rap section by Del Naja. The album ends with a reprise of the Exchange instrumental!!! <br /> <br />Mezzanine is as dark as Massive Attack got. Soon after the albums release one of its main members Andrew Vowles (aka Mushroom) would leave the group over artistic differences, Massive Attack would never be the same again, and for the worse. But Mezzanine see's Massive Attack leaving the 90's on a high knowing that they were not only one of the most influencial but one of the best!!!!!
B00000JCB2|5.0|Yes, Its really a new experience to HEAVY ROCK! This band really rocks with every track. They have a very mature music which is created only for those who can grasp it! limp bizkit's fan's must be a very unique persons. Somoone who thinks ODD, who lives ODD & not living for others. Yes, for those are this band & this album is for. Am sure, our of 50 persons, only 1 will like & praise this album. For them , this is so precious stuff. Listening to this album gives an energy to push your live & lifestyle. This album is totally an OUT OF THE BOX Xperience! <br /> <br />This album is the BEST out of all other albums. Nookie & Breakstuff are well known songs from this compilation. But, there are many other great songs like \\"No Sex\\" , \\"Re-arrangged\\" & many more with true lyrics. <br /> <br />Give it a try! You'll find my word true....
B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attack released Blue Lines in 1991, it would be the first of three albums released in the decade and all were classics. Blue Lines in the best of them though because it is revolutionary and would influence others (ie. Moby, Chemical Brothers, The Streets). This was actually the beginning of Trip Hop, something latter on that would be readapted by American black artists and be called Hip Hop. The rap songs are performed by Horace Andy, Tricky, Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall & Tony Brian. Whilst the soul songs were performed by Shara Nelson. Not forgetting Mikey General's background vocals!!!    Blue Lines begins with the sutile Safe From Harm, before going into rap mode in One Love & Blue Lines. Be Thankful for what you've got is sutile soul, whilst Five Man army is another soulful rap tune. Unfinished Sympathy is probably one of the most well known Massive Attack tunes as it was the only single released from the album. Daydreaming is another clever rap tune, whilst Lately is another classic soul tune. The album ends with Hymn of the Black Wheel another soul tune but not sung by Shara Nelson, instead sung brilliantly by Horace Andy!!!    Blue Lines was the beginning of what would be one of the most influencial groups of the 1990's. Actually for just this release they renamed themselves Massive because the album was released at the same time as the Gulf War and the record company thought it would be too risky to be called Massive Attack at that time. Although popular in the UK they would claim proper world wide commercial aclaim with their 1994 release Protection, and would continue their popularity with the 1998 smash it release Mezzanine. But Blue Lines still remains a bench mark not only for Massive Attack but all Trip Hop, Hip Hop, and electronic Pop acts. Great stuff indeed!!!!!
0385510454|1.0|After searching for a story for about 170 pages, it finally became apparent to me that there was none. I did, however, learn several words in Italian. <br />As a longtime fan of Grisham, I am becoming less and less impressed with his work.
B000000W6X|5.0|Protection was released in 1994. With Tricky already having success with his own newly made group Portishead, & with their massive hit album Dummy just around the corner, there was alot of pressure on Massive Attack. So on the album they used Everything but the girl's Tracy Thorn on lead vocals to replace Blue Line's female vocalist Shara Nelson, although she would return for the 1998 smash hit album Mezzanine. <br /> <br />The album begins with the lushous Protection, the groups sound has definitely changed, as it's more of a heavy beat than the first album & Tracy's vocals really work here. Karma Koma is next, this would be a very popular radio hit, and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song. Three is quite a dark track, again Tracy on vocals here, whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental Weather Storm continues into the darkness. Spying Glass is a more of a hip tune, performed by Del Naja, whilst Better Things is a smooth sould tune, skillfully performed by Tracy. Euro Child is suprisingly the first rap song since Karma Koma (I say suprisingly as Blue Lines contained alot of rap tunes in it) Tracy's on vocals again for Sly, which returns kinda into the darkness, whilst if Sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album Heat Miser is definitely in the darkness. The album strangely ends with a live rendition of The Doors classic Light my Fire, but done in Massive style, it has to be heard to be believed!!!! <br /> <br />Protection is definitely different from its predecessor Blue Lines & whilst I'd definitely recommend it, I think I would advice people who are new to the group to buy Blue Lines first as Protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first. The band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release Mezzanine!!!!
B00064WSNW|5.0|\\"Court of the Crimson King,\\" \\"Lark's Tongue in Aspic\\" and \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" may define the \\"classic\\" King Crimson, but \\"Discipline\\" has to be high tide for Fripp's creativity, inspiration, musicianship and genius.   <br /> <br />This disc only qualifies as prog-rock because, even after all of this time, there isn't a genre it comfortably fits in.  Fripp had just completed groundbreaking collaborations with Eno and Bowie, as well as work with Peter Gabriel.  Out of that experience he created a very personal distillation of the most exciting elements of African poly-rhythms, new wave esthetics, minimalism and Berlin electronica filtered through his own neo-classical approach, and the result of that was two absolute masterpieces (his solo album \\"Exposure\\" and the reinvented King Crimson's \\"Discipline\\").   <br /> <br />\\"The Sheltering Sky\\" is a timeless gem.  Part soundscape, part ambient piece, part improvisational instrumental, this piece creates a sound world I could stay inside for another 20 minutes without tiring of. <br /> <br />\\"Discipline\\" combines Steve Reich style minimalism (in fact, this track reminds me of the best aspects of Reich's \\"Drumming\\" but is far more pleasurable listening) with rigid classical structure weaving in and out of a bed of African poly-rhythms. <br /> <br />\\"Indiscipline\\" is more amusing when you know that the bizarrely cryptic lyrics are in fact a letter Belew's wife wrote to him describing a sculpture she completed while he was away recording. <br /> <br />As great as this CD is, it has some weak spots.  Belew's guitar on \\"Elephant Talk\\" sounds more novelty than clever with 30 years of perspective.  Up against the rest of the tracks, \\"Frame by Frame\\" feels more like filler now.  And the song's lyrics don't quite match the brilliant musicianship on \\"Matte Kudasai.\\" <br /> <br />If you want one album to represent King Crimson in your collection, choose one of the three \\"classic\\" albums.  But if you want King Crimson at their most inventive, get this one. <br />
B00004XONN|3.0|On the aftermath of their 1998 smash OK Computer, Radiohead were on top of the world, they were the biggest band on the planet, magazines from Rolling Stones, and Q were billing them up as the next big thing. So right into 2000 Radiohead released Kid A, with everyone expecting OK Computer II, Radiohead like only they can did something completely different!!!! <br /> <br />They must have obviously been listening to Massive Attack's 1998 smash Mezzanine as Kid A's dark merkiness is for all to see, and althought there are brilliant moments (Everything in its right place, The national anthem, How to dissapear completly, & Motion picture soundtrack) the rest does become a bit disjointed, especially in the middle of the album. But does this make Radiohead a bad band, no way!!!! <br /> <br />If anything Kid A is a gutsy album, and whatever people might say was definitely the right choice, had they done what everyone wanted OK Computer II, then there was no way it would be as good, and they'd more likely be bashed for lack of invention. In Kid A there is no way one can bash them for direction, if anything they should be praised for this, as if anything it kept me interested, and even though not my favourite Radiohead album you kinda knew they still had alot left in the tank!!! <br /> <br />So if you are a massive Radiohead fan & don't own this, I think it's definitely worth a buy. But if you are new to Radiohead I suggest you start of with earlier albums such as the brilliant The Bends or the very classy OK Computer, this is Kid A is just too heavy to grasp for someone who has never heard this kind of music before

B0000A1HQP|5.0|If you liked Francis Verber's \\"The Closest\\" (featuring what can only be described as France's All-Star Acting Team), then you must seek out his serio-comic masterpiece \\"The Dinner Game.\\"  Verber adapted his self-penned play for the screen and had the good sense to cast the play's long-running star, Jacques Villeret, as his 'idiot' foil, François Pignon (interestingly carrying the same name as Verber's protagonist in \\"The Closet\\" but played there by Daniel Auteuil).  Villeret - who passed away of a cerebral hemorrhage in January 2005 - was renowned in his homeland for this classic portrayal.  No description here can do it justice.<br /><br />Verber has a top-notch stable of actors that he uses in both films, most notably France's \\"leading leading man\\" Thierry Lhermitte (as Pierre Brochant) and the beautiful and classy Alexandra Vandernoot as his on-screen wife.  As befits a screenplay adapted faithfully from a play, the action - well over 80% of it - takes place in one room (the living area of the Brochants' well-appointed apartment).<br /><br />The title of the film (and play) is a bit of a head-fake.  Due to unforeseen events, Brochant and Pignon never make it to the idiot dinner.  Or, maybe they do.  You be the judge.<br /><br />Of special note here are the outstanding English sub-titles.  The movie is filled with intricate and hilarious wordplay, the gist of which is that Pignon misunderstands the nuances of things and hilarity ensues.  It's quite a feat to get that type of humor to translate across a language barrier, but the filmmakers and their distributors (helped immeasurably by Villeret's classic deadpan takes) have succeeded in spades.
1401206905|4.0|One of the best Batman books writen by Frank Miller. It is a both a retelling of the Batman origin and a 'prequile' to DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. This book is often unjustly underated.<br /><br />With BATMAN DARK KNIGHT RETUNS Miller first gave us his veiw of Batman. I liked that book. As with anything with Miller it is dark, but it works here. the only thing I did not like was the fight between Superman and Batman. those two are suposed to be bestfriends not enemies. yet Miller makes Superman a pawn of the system. however dispite that DARK KNIGHT was a good read. (The Joker makes a chilling apperance in this book.) BATMAN DARK KNIGHT STRICKS BACK is not a favorite of mine. art is much more sloppy and the story line just does not interest me.<br /><br />Any way BATMAN YEAR ONE is very interesting. it takes the Batman orgin story, updates it, and retells it for the modern day.<br /><br />over the past years Batman's orgin had become watered down. at first he is a orphen whose parents where both shot by a mugger. then it is his father who is shot while his mother dies of a 'weak heart' from seeing her husband die. then still it is a crime boss who has the shooter pose as a mugger to kill mr. Wayne in revenge for Wayne putting him in jail. over time these things made the story less of a mere chance a deadly twist of fate. Miller restors the orignal version with both parents being killed by a mugger. he adds that all three were coming back from a movie. miller names the movie as MARK OF ZORRO. which is a tribute to Bob Kane, creater of Batman. it is the silent MARK OF ZORRO with Douglas Fairbanks that first influenced Kane in the creation of Batman. (just as the silent movie THE MAN WHO LAUGHES played a part of the creation of the Joker.) this i felt was a nice touch on Miller's part.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is a man driven by revenge and a need for justice. he has spent 12 years abroad training to be the best fighter he can be. he only lackes the means to fight crime. (as you will notice the movie BATMAN BEGINS is hevily influenced by this book.)after a faled attempt to face the enemey on their own ground Bruce silently askes for aid from his father. he knows that he needs the 'fear of God' to frighten criminals. then crashing threw the window comes a large bat which had frightened Bruce as a child. thus Bruce becomes a bat. (in DARK KNIGHT RETURNS the large bat seems to almost take posetion of Burce.) Bruce starts fighting crime as Batman. facing small time crooks at first. yet he almost blows it on his first time. (here Miller shows that Bruce is just a man like any one. capable of faults and failings like any man.) later Bruce takes on the corupt system which is run by the mob. yet he soon sees he can not do it alone. he needs a friend.<br /><br />Most interesting of all is that this book made James Gordon a much more interesting charture. Any nay sayers against this book should remeamber that. before this Gordon was just a foil a means of introducing the crime, and was usly set into the background. Grodon is merely there as a point of exposition. explianing the plot etc.<br /><br />Remember Gordon was there from the begining, when Batman first appeared in DETECTIVE COMICS. he was simply the police comishiner who fought crime and who later sought the aid of the Dark Knight Detective. During the 70's and 80's the charture was fleshed out a bit. yet it is here that Gordon becomes a much more intresting chature. after this book other writers follow in Miller's footsteps in showing just how good a charture Gordon can be. in this book Miller shows Gordon as a flesh and blood human being. with as much faults as virtues.<br /><br />In fact much of the book focuses on Gordon rather then Batman, not that batman is not given enough scean time. Gordon is a man with morals and good jugment. yet in a city like Gotham such cops are very unwelcome. the police office is rife with graft and seedy officers. Miller compares the swat team to Nazis. oneof the officers, Flass, decides to teach Gordon a 'lesson' and beats him up. yet Gordon pics himself up and is not so easily beaten. he takes out Flass and leaves him naked on the side of the road in handcuffs. Gordon reflects \\"Thanks Flass, you've shown me what it takes to be a cop in Gotham.' gordon is also a man who must deal with raising a child in a crime filled city, and a job which often takes him away from his wife. most of all Gordon is even tempted by a fellow femal cop, and breifly has an effair with her. here Miller shows Gordon at his most human. gordon reconciles with his wife in favor of raising his son. yet he must lern that when raising a child he must face the burden of protecting him from harm.<br /><br />Again this is the best thing about the book that Miller can show Gordon as an average man with all the good and bad a normal man has.<br /><br />other chartures that appear are Alfred, who here raised Bruce as a seragat father. Miller makes Alfred a rather sardonic charture which I found to be amusing. Harvey Dent (who would later become Two Face) appears. here he is a strugling assitant distract atterny attempting to fight a corupt system. Catwoman apeares here as a hooker who takes to stealing in a cat suit. (the spin off CATWOMAN HER SISTERS KEEPER deals with Catwoman's story. it is one of the better spin off stories from BATMAN YEAR ONE.)<br /><br />over all i found BATMAN YEAR ONE to be a good read. some typical Miller stuff but it is the human chartures that are the most interesting.<br /><br />Miller is currently doing a new BATMAN series. yet here i found his Batman to be more driven like some army general in a war. which in some ways i am not sure i like, but can understand. allthough i find it a bit to Nazish making the charture that way. at any rate as i stated this is the best of Miller's Batman.<br /><br />this book serves a good retelling of the Batman orgin for the modern day.<br /><br />also look out for such books which follow almost along the same lines such as ROBIN YEAR ONE, BATGIRL YEAR ONE, and NIGHTWING YEAR ONE. each which show the early years of the title chartures. each are good reads.<br /><br />fans of the BATMAN BEGINS movie should pic up BATMAN YEAR ONE as well as BATMAN THE LONG HALLOWEEN. (it is LONG HALLOWEEN that deals much mure with the Roman, a chariture which Miller only dealt with rather breifly.)eam to Nazis. one of the officers, Flass, decides to teach Gordon a 'lesson' and beats him up. yet Gordon pics himself up and is not so easily beaten. he takes out Flass and leaves him naked on the side of the road in handcuffs.

B000001E18|5.0|This album was first released in the fall of 1993 and this period echoed in the fine middle years of this second decade band from Ireland. And from this album many fine songs became hits with fans and dance clubs all around the world. Many songs have been used in TV, ads, movies and marketing promotions and are familiar and catchy tunes. The songs of 'Numb' and 'Lemon' will most definitely be familiar to the loyal and deeply entrenched U2 friends and fans. 'Numb' was U2's first experimentation in rock mixing with low techno ambient beats. Another song that was made famous is the romantic and sensual song 'Stay' which is another personal favourite of mine. Bono's voice in this song conveys and carries so much emotion that one cannot be helped but me swepted along on the wave of deep-rooted emotions.<br /><br />The latter part of the album is less sparky and more of a contemplative quiet jaunt of a softer U2 sound. Overall, this album is a success and U2 again shows why they have been popular for so long. This CD is a must for any true U2 fan out there.
1402555989|4.0|This is a very good \\"listen\\" with some important caveats. It is told in the voice of a teenager afflicted with compulsive disorders and consequently there are some long (and to me,rather dull)passages exploring his interests. It also wraps up a little too neatly. But it is enjoyable and a good story.
0689865384|5.0|\\"Uglies\\" is an enjoyable read from beginning to end. At no point of reading this book was I ever bored. The author's style was refreshing and unique, a nice breather from authors with good ideas but a poor way of putting those ideas in an interesting and clever way on paper. I found that Westerfeld's \\"Uglies\\" was a book that had both of these important qualities.<br /><br />This book is fun and light, it's meaning obvious yet not so obvious you wan to put the book down due to boredom. Reading it requires little to no re-reading (you know what it mean, having to read a paragraph over and over again to understand it in full).<br /><br />This book could easily be compared to \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowrey (parden me if I spelled her name wrong). Both books have their main characters growing up in utopian societies and realizing that these societies are not all they are cracked up to read. Quite honestly, I'm very much looking forward to reading its sequel, \\"Pretties\\".
0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden's retelling of the Mogadishu tragedy provides an excellent history of capturing the who, what, when, where, and why this terrible event took place.  For anyone interested in what seemed like an unrelated event in the course of American history should read this book.  Bowden gives a brief introduction into the events that in some small and seemingly unrelated way led to the 9/11 tragedy and how Bin Laden was intimately involved in supplying and backing Aidid from his \\"ranch\\" in Sudan.   <br /> <br />It also captures how then President Clinton and his cabinet were seemingly caught unaware of this tragic event under his watch. However it is clear they were intimately involved in the details of this operation.   <br /> <br />Most tragic is the story of the men who lost their lives fighting to help restore order to the nation of Somalia and enforce UN resolutions to aid the suffering Somalia people. This scar of abandoning our mission only a day after 18 men died and 73 were injured (not to mention numerous Somali's) would embolden our enemies for the next decade and was yet another indictment of the failure this administration to act upon events that could have prevented forthcoming tragedies.  The paperback edition and its' epilogue also captures the tragedy of the UN and the rest of the world in forgetting about the immense suffering in Somalia. <br /> <br />For those interested in understanding world events I highly recommend this very objective rendering of the events that took place in Oct of 1993.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|\\"Defying Gravity\\" is stuck in my head and I can't get it out...nor do I think I want to. Seriously, the Chicago cast blows the doors off of the Broadway soundtrack.

I would play it more often but I would think that is silly. <br /> <br />Amazing stuff.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Every single song is a piece of art. I have ripped every single song on this album to my iTunes playlist. This album is an artistic expression that is rarely equaled by other singers. I don't even like most of these old standards, but Ms. Olstead has given me reason to pause and think about each note that crosses her lips. Her singing is like a slow drip to my brain that makes it all smooth and happy. <br /> <br />There is not one single thing that I would change about this album, except to add more tunes. Renee, it's time to give us more!!! I want more of your music, an urge that I have felt with only one other singer, Jane Olivor, over the course of my life. I cannot wait for the release of her next collection.

Overall, it's worth it, but I'm still looking for the definitive collection of Madonna Louise Ciccone's music.
0393324818|5.0|This is a combination of a detailed insider's perspective (Billy Beane) on the great American game and an explanation of how one of the winningest franchises manages to put a winner on the field with little money.  This book explains how the A's evaluated players and broke the mold, hiring newly minted Ivy League grads to line the front offices.  These grads used evalution techniques first noticed by Bill James, to draft, sign and trade for players that fit the system and were undervalued by the \\"market\\". Anyone who keeps baseball or business as a hobby would enjoy this book.
B0000691U1|5.0|You know, there are some albums that you pretty much think have to be good, and you have these enormously high expectations for them.  And more often than not, they don't quite live up to them. <br /> <br />\\"Money Jungle\\" is one of the exceptions to that rule.  A dream meeting-- bandleader Duke Ellington sits at the piano, generously supported by his compositional heir in bassist Charles Mingus and sublime bop drummer Max Roach.  With this backing, Ellington is inspired in a far more assertive light than he is usually found as Mingus and Roach push him along.  Mingus is downright aggressive and perhaps even angry throughout the proceedings-- check his playing \\"Money Jungle\\", where he occasioanlly switches from his swing to an aggressive repetitive figure, as if daring his collaborators to drift outside of the swing (they don't), or his fierceness on \\"Wig Wise\\" in sharp contrast to Ellington's light and bouncey touch.  Somehow, Roach, often considered the most lyrical of drummers, finds a way to negotiate through this and keep the tension between Ellington and Mingus to a boil. <br /> <br />The entire record is pretty much a highlight-- from the fluttering bass of \\"Fleurette Africaine\\" (echoed by Ellington and Roach) to Ellington's beautiful revisitation of \\"Solitude\\" (in my favorite reading of the piece) to the straight blues of \\"REM Blues\\", there's not a bad cut on here, although I suspect anybody deeply rooted in the swing tradition will find the playing a bit out of character, and certainly Ellington is inspired into a different light by his younger protegees. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, as far as jazz records go, this one is pretty much indispensible.  Highly recommended.
0226264211|5.0|Whether one agrees with his views or not they must acknowledge that Friedman presents new and solid ideas (and examples) to support his argument.  Friedman clearly defines the central idea of the book and lays out his point in an interesting and knowledgeable way, unfortunatley (or fortunatley) this book leaves you wanting more because of the interest it stimulates.  I purchased the 40th Anniversary Edition and I must say that there would be no need for a 40th Anniversary Edition if this book were not a classic.
B000003N7Y|3.0|1963's \\"Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus\\" is an anomoly in Charles Mingus' catalog-- the last time he'd enter the studio for nearly eight years, it serves of sorts as a bookend to the period of 1956-1964, wherein Mingus recorded masterpiece after masterpiece-- \\"Pithecanthropus Erectus\\" for Atlantic, \\"Tijuana Moods for RCA, \\"Mingus Ah Um\\" for Columbia, \\"Pre-Bird\\" for Mercury,  \\"Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus\\" for Candid and \\"THe Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\\" were all recorded in this time, as were at least a dozen other great albums.  For this one, Mingus chose to revisit his old material, rerecording several pieces from older records along with one new song (\\"Celia\\"). <br /> <br />For these performances, Mingus used eleven pieces-- two of the songs were recorded during the 'Black Saint' sessions and feature alto saxaphonists Charles Mariano, while the remainder of the record was recorded in late 1963 with an extension of Mingus' working band, including Eric Dolphy and Booker Ervin (although curiously, drummer Dannie Richmond is absent from these sessions). <br /> <br />The material is all performed quite well, but nothing seems to reach quite the level of the originals.  Admittedly, \\"Celia\\" is a lovely piece, \\"I X Love\\" (a rewrite of part of \\"Open Letter to Duke\\") features unnervingly brilliant playing from Mariano, and \\"Better Get Hit In Yo' Soul\\" is always a blast, but it feels like a bookend, not like an album, particularly after a monster like \\"Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\\".
B0002858YS|5.0|I've can't count as high as the number times I've played this album.  My favorite indie-pop album.  Franz Ferdinand, also good, but just can't match up to The Killers' unique, big-sounding, catchy (but not too catchy) songs on this album
1573223026|5.0|One of my favorite authors reminds me (and us, I hope) how hard it is to live, but with the same wit and acerbic humor I've come to love about Hornby.  Nothing funnier than foiling suicide attempts without the immediate redemption and resolution of finding reasons to live.  In fact, as these main characters continue living, they are constantly reminded of why they wanted to die in the first place.  And just like in real life, it takes a long time to find your way up from the depths of life's misery, as well as up from life's shallow annoyances.

I recenty seen them in concert at the Tweeter Center in NJ and as soon as I heard the first few notes of Beyond the Realms of Death, well, let's just say I got chills all over, and lost my voice the day after. It was one of the best metal shows I've seen, and I've been to many...If they are in your area definately check'm out, close your eyes and just listen, you'd never know that so many years have passed.... <br />Keep Rockin'   \m/
0679736646|3.0|This book was random and disconnected with a painfully plodding plot, ridiculously 2 dimensional characters, and horrible writing.  It was so dang boring that it became a chore to read... I couldn't finish it and put it aside with a feeling of relief.  This book is truly a three star stinker.  I would have given it just two stars if not for a couple of interesting scenes.  As it is I am being very generous.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|Finally someone reissued this on a decent sounding, well packaged CD. This beats the pants off of the previous CD version. The bonus tracks are fascinating. What on Earth was John Cale thinking when he mixed I Wanna Be Your Dog with the guitar sounding like a bumble bee, the drums way off in another room somewhere and a giant set of sleighbells dominating everything? The record would never have ignited the punk revolution if it had been issued with his mixes. The liner notes and photos are informative. Look at those amplifiers! And that Mosrite bass.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I, along with my 13 and 15 year old boys, enjoyed this action movie that moved quick.  The characters covered a lot of ground and the plot educated while providing intrigue and excitement.  The sound might scare away some with all the shooting and explosions.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I've been a Bowie fan for years and years, and his renaissance during the past decade has been a true blessing.  He's in great voice, the songs are full of hooks and variety, the band is top-notch, and his reunion with Tony Visconti pushes him to even greater heights. <br /> <br />Unfortunate that this gets no radio attention, since it is better than just about anything else being recorded today.
0894803123|4.0|I was put off by the overly  groovy graphics in this book, but figured it was part of the whole Ben & Jerry's mystique. I was right.<br /><br />This book is simple and explains how to use your new machine. The booklets that come with them are not nearly enough. Further, it has short discussions on how the recipes were developed and what doesn't work. (Like ripe bananas.)<br /><br />It gives you the confidence to try new things, and to get great results. (Blueberry ice cream? Yum!)
B000085RTZ|1.0|Kamelot I don't think is a real consistant band.  Yes they have a few good songs. But only a few. The lyrics are boring and have no good stories or twist to them and the music is nothing special.  Nothing new here on this CD.  There isn't a good song that you would listen to over and over again.  There is just something missing.  If I were you I wouldn't spend your money on this Cd. Save it for a better album other than this. You are not missing much, trust me.  If I could I would rate this CD a zero.
0812550706|1.0|This book was on my daughter's middle school reading list.  I have strongly objected with the school due to the profanity, depictions of women/girls as inferior, graphic sexual description, use of racial slurs, and acceptance of \\"murder by the oppressed.\\"  We should absolutely hold up the ideal to our kids and let them see good literature that is good reading, and enjoyable without all the profanity and objectionable themes.  Ender's Game is not appropriate for this age, in my opinion.  Ender's Game is not good literature. <br />
B00005O3VC|3.0|It was okay, but it didn't seem to have alot of features that I had thought it might have had.
B0000639FE|1.0|Oh, this was one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen!  Tom Cruise usually does a decent job in any EveryMan role he's played (even though he seems to be off his meds these days no matter what the Scientologists do for him), but this was just plain bad.  \\"You had me at hello\\" and \\"Show me the money\\" became the most cloying expressions since \\"Where's the beef?\\".  It has a mushy love story, a chubby cheeked kid, and makes you just want to run to the nearest barf bag because it's a stealth chick flick.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film shocked me while watching it. It had so many twists and turns I was surprised I didn't get confused at one point or another. This is a really good thriller that was ever made in a long time. Guy Pearce is really good as Leonard a man who has memory loss who leaves himself clues to help him find his wife's killer. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss are great in their supporting roles. The ending is very shocking as well. From Christopher Nolan who directed Insomia and the new Batman movie. Highly Recommended.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is special. I found myself, even though I read very little, anxious to pick this book up again until i finished it. The   Summary of the book says this is about the bugger wars. I don't believe that as much as i believe that this is about ender and his inner demons. It's the relationship between Orson's characters that makes his novels unique and powerful. The story, once it gets started, never lets up and tells a good lesson in most every chapter, adding to the grand message at the end. It's really remarkable and i reccommend this book to anyone out there looking to get into either a new series, or looking for a good 1 time read. this is truely the pinacle of top notch literature.
0060736267|5.0|It's been two or three years since I've read this book, but what's prompting me to write a review on it, is that I've just read Joy in the Morning by Betty Smith and I could remember all to well, how much I loved her first book, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  <br /> <br />I remember first hearing about the book and thinking, \\"Well, this probably wont be interesting to me since it's not like the books I read,\\" but I was wrong...after reading the first twenty pages, I was hooked!! The same with Joy in the Morning, though I'll have to admit I like Joy in the Morning better. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read outside of their usual genres.  <br /> <br />I also recommend her book, Joy in the Morning!!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|A beautiful take on a Broadway classic.  I've never seen the Broadway show, but can't imagine it being any better than this.  The scenery, costumes, grandeur...all exquisite.  The 105-piece orchestra takes the music to a new level of beauty(\\"The Music of the Night\\" is particularly gorgeous at the end), combined with the beautiful vocals; a stunning experience.   <br /> <br />Emmy Rossum, gives a spectacular performance as Christine.  Her singing is absolutely beautiful, and she effortlessly conveys the innocence and sweetness of Christine.  Priceless is the expression on her face whenever she's around the Phantom, a combination of desire and intrigue that only he can bring out in her.     <br /> <br />Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, quite literally steals the show.  His voice is powerful, highly emotional, and a little unpredictable, which suits our hero perfectly.  In this movie, he's the hero, hands down.  Charismatic, sexy and incredibly suave, Butler leaves us desperately wanting see Christine give in to her obvious attraction to the Phantom (preferably with juicy details for us), even AFTER he murders a couple of cast members and nearly destroys the entire opera house (you'll forget about that stuff almost as quickly as it happens), even AFTER his mask comes off (it's not pretty, but he's so intoxicating, we don't care).  And his performance at the end of the movie will break your heart.   <br /> <br />The chemistry between the Phantom and Christine is sizzling.  Their scenes together, from the time the Phantom first takes her hand as her leads her to his underground dwelling, to their scorching duet in \\"The Point of No Return,\\" are the hottest, sexiest moments I have seen in a movie this year. <br /> <br />Raoul, played by Patrick Wilson, serves his part well.  He's cute, in a 17th-century sort of way, and his voice is phenomenal, flawless, perfect.  He's dull, but that's the whole point.  This ain't his movie, and we don't want him and Christine together anyway.  Still, we never doubt his love for her, as bland as that love may be.  Christine, too, is a little expressionless while she's around Raoul, but that's to be expected as well.  He doesn't bring out the passion in her like the Phantom does.       <br />     <br />My only complaint(besides craving the opposite ending): I wanted to see more!  I would have loved to see another scene with Christine and the Phantom, to see their characters filled out a little more.  There are a lot of ways to interpret this movie, and some missing information that you can fill in for yourself.   Beautiful, tragic, and haunting...you will cry at the end...and watch it over and over.
B0009RJUVE|5.0|This was my first book of Jodi Picoult and I absolutley loved it. I found it quite intriguing and had difficulty putting it down as I wanted to continue reading even though I was desperately in need of sleep. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone as I thought it was a great read.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|The first cd to have the original priest lineup in awhile is awesome. It is pure metal. It is great to hear Rob Halford with Judas Priest again because his voice still sounds great after all these years. The songs are really great with the exception of Lochness, which is a bit too long imo. Favorites include Judas Rising, Deal With The Devil, Revolution, Worth Fighting For, Wheels Of Fire, Angel (Beautiful Ballad), and Hellrider. Highly Recommended. LONG LIVE PRIEST!!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Great, the quality of the delivery and the producto was as espected
B000099T3P|4.0|Without a doubt this is one of those fluke hits in the 80's. I mean you have hair ball monsters that can eat just about anything, rolling around, and man-handling a farm. Its stupid beyond anything yes, but it also maintained a horror element. Something that diffenly would get lost on the rest of the movies in the series. Few people will tell you the sequel was better than the first, but personally i liked the 2nd one better. This though is still dang good, but nothing like the epic fight that would be in the next movie. So get the dvd and enjoy a movie that was made when movies were good. They could tell a story, entertain....without the overblown and sometimes embarassing effects of CGI now.
B000002J2F|5.0|I am happy to say that on the album Duke(1980) the band starts writing more songs together again like Behind the Lines, Dutchess, Turn it on Again, Duke's Travels, and Duke's End. It's only five songs but it's a start. The album starts out with BEHIND THE LINES, a great start for the album. Next, DUTCHESS is one of the prog-rockers of the album. GUIDE VOCAL is a very short and slow song and MAN OF OUR TIMES is one of Mike's wierdest songs that strays from his typical slower love songs. MISUNDERSTANDING is Phil Collins' first solo composition for the band and the dramatic HEATHAZE is a good Tony Banks songs. TURN IT ON AGAIN is an example of the band's pop-style future. ALONE TONIGHT is a pretty good song but not a rock song. CUL-DE-SAC sounds a bit like a showtune and PLEASE DON'T ASK is Phil's typical love song. DUKE'S TRAVELS and DUKE'S END is the grand finale of the album that combines some of the previous songs on the album. This album is great but would've been greater in my opinion if the b-sides EVIDENCE OF AUTUMN and OPEN DOOR were on here.
B0002858YS|5.0|I can only hope the next album comes soon. I'm dying to hear the Killers--their sound is similar to all the other bands you've heard, such as Ferdinand, but wait! Do these songs actually sound like something I'd want to listen to? Instead of the crap the Ferdinand puts out? Yes! Why, the Killers have forumlated such amazing tunes that I can only hope Ferdinand and the others catch some of the genious, too. Long LIVE the Killers! ;)
B0001611DI|5.0|George A. Romero's followup to his cult classic Night of the Living Dead is a classic in its own right. Superior to its predecessor Dawn deals with some global issues. Two issues that are brought to the front are racism and Darwinism (Survival of the Fittest), as a group of four humans fight off zombies and humans alike. The makeup by Tom Savini is great and the zombies look real. Savini also appears as one of the bikers who the four humans must fight to keep the mall intact. Romero's direction is sort of cartoonish in this film but it fits. A not really all scares film but still a really good movie with some touching and funny moments as well. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The best live concert dvd that I ever seen, the sound and the video are great and the band enjoys to play during almost more than two hours and half all their greatest hits including the solo hits of their members, something strange in this kind of performing, Joe Walsh is outstanding, the supporting musician are brilliant, this is truly essencial, is my first five star rate. Such a faithful perfomance.    I  would like some others legendary band do the same.     TORRY
1573226521|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read (and I've read quite a few). It could be I relate to the characters fairly well but I'm quite sure that is not all to it. Once you finish reading you wish you lived at the beach, at least for a while. It's fast paced, set in a paradise that almost sprays your face with saltwater and the clearest sand every time you turn a page. The book conveys such emotion that it can make you reread many times just to see if such and such would do something different. The movie is obviously not the greatest; I'd say the book does the same regarding the atmosphere and setting but strongly surpasses the movie character and plotwise. I truly recommend it. Its quite a shame that Garland (and most others) won't ever write a book like this one again.
0195067142|5.0|In this book you will follow the Marines in their battles on both Peleliu and Okinawa.  This book is not intended to give a full grasp of the entire Pacific campaign.  It is also not about the strategies involved for the taking of the islands.<br /><br />It is a book told from the perspective of the Marines and Soldiers that had to endure impossible conditions and hellish experiences.  This book is not for the faint-hearted.  It is graphic and gruesome, so the reader should be prepared for that.<br /><br />I first read this book while doing training maneuvers in my infantry company.  It made me laugh at the futility of what we were doing.  Nothing we trained for would have prepared us for the conditions these men endured.<br /><br />I also think that this is a good book for people wanting to understand the rationale used for the grave decision to employ atomic weaponry and end this war hastily.  This is not advocation per se of this form of warfare.  It is just a way to get into the minds of the people responsible for preventing more U.S. fatalities.
B00006AW2M|5.0|The Rolling Stones made this album in response to The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper album. This album sounds like an acid trip, very experimental 60's music. But it has some great songs on it. Mick's voice sounds haunting on this album it gives me chills while listening to it. The album cover is really disturbing when looking at it, it looks even darker than Sgt. Peppers's cover. The Stones show that they could keep in gear when another band experiments. Favorites include Sing This All Together, Citadel, 2000 Man, She's a Rainbow, and Gomper. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0006L16N8|1.0|NO MORE.  THAT'S ENOUGH. DOWN WITH COLDPLAY!!!! IT'S TIME FOR A NEW PARADIGM.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|Great movie. Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madelene Stowe were excellent. <br /> <br />It's one you will watch over and over.
0345410025|3.0|If anyone has ever done a memory improvement course then the material presented here will be nothing new.  This book is neither good nor bad it is average.  If you purchased Mega Memory from Kevin Trudeau in the 90's then you will be upset because the same material they covered for hundreds of dollars is available here for a fraction. <br /> <br />It is told in a strange format of two people asking and answering each others questions to lay out the material they want to present.  The questions are annoying and unrealistic but necessary for this type of narrative. <br /> <br />I was looking for something new in this book. The techniques do work.  Their success is only limited by how much you dedicate yourself to them.  I started using the same techniques in college and did notice an improvement in my memory. <br /> <br />The stuff works just don't expect miracles or drastic changes. <br />
B0000024ZI|5.0|Mott the Hoople is one of those bands which had its glory, but disappeared. This is their best album. Produced by rock legend David Bowie, this introduces the second coming of Mott who had an album which didn't go so well. Bowie wrote the song All The Young Dudes which Mott made into their own song. Ian Hunter is a great singer and also has Mick Ralphs on guitar who would later join Bad Company. Also great is the cover of the Velvet Underground's Sweet Jane and its the best cover of the song IMO. Also added is an early version of the Bad Company hit Ready for Love. Favorites include Sweet Jane, Momma's Little Jewel, All The Young Dudes, One Of The Boys, Ready For Love/After Lights, and Sea Diver. Highly Highly Recommended.
B000002UAU|5.0|This belongs in everyone's top five recordings of all time.  <br />Music as we know it would not exist without Sgt. Peppers. <br />The recording techniques, the clarity, the variety of this recording inspired many who probably have nothing else in common and many of whom wouldn't even call themselves Beatles fans. <br />It brought many other types of music into what was starting to become a predictable format.  It changed everything!
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I was told by some of my friends that this movie was hilarious. So i watched it. I sat there for almost the whole movie, waiting for something to happen. It does have its funny parts. but the whole movie is just slow, and nothing really happens. i don't know how anyone can say this movie is all that great. i gave it two stars, because it did have some good parts in it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B000024D4R|5.0|Every Floyd album up to The Wall is nigh on perfection but this one is perfect. Finally, a concept that isn't about Syd Barret at all! So rare in Pink Floyd, and so nice. Plus, the george orwell themes are much appreciated. <br />I agree with the person who said the music is mostly waht makes this album. The lyrics are perfect really, but coming from Roger they seem a bit \\"fake.\\" Sheep is my favorite of the album, because of hte lyrics. <br />Pink Floyd never rocked this hard before or after. I mean they TRIED to, but they didn't do it as succesfully as here. Dogs deserves every second of it's 17 minute playing time. Pigs is weaker, but not much. THe vocal melody seems a bit awkward. Dave saves Roger's sorta crappy songs by arranging them to you know, have melodies and great harmonies. Love that Gilmour!
0930289528|4.0|This comic came out 20 years to early it turns out. <br /> <br />Now, more than ever, in the U.S. we live in a culture of fear, fear of terror, fear of our government, fear that someone, somewhere is getting something more than us.  I wish this comic had more of a concrete tone to it rather than wandering around a bit.  But hey, that is a small complaint for a great book 20 years before its time. <br /> <br />V is a seriously cool, edgy book that looks at one man's choice to make a difference.  Radical.  Un-PC.  <br /> <br />I am obviously biased as a staunch libertarian.  This book is excellent and deserves a reading by anyone concerned about how large the State has become. <br /> <br />Plus, education and information wrapped up in a kick butt comic.  How can you lose?
0790729407|4.0|Michael Collins could have afforded the move to America.  His brother sent him the money to buy a ticket.<br /><br />I would have ranked this movie five stars, but I despise Julia Roberts.  Also, I will agree with \\"Black and Tan\\" that it was not entirely factual.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Frank Miller's popular underground graphic novel is one of the most intense, dark, and dastardly comic books I've ever seen.  Along with David Lapham's Sray Bullets series, I can't think of a better example of dark underground comic book that is entirely necessary, and as dark and twisted as it should be. <br /> <br />With that, I have to express my disgust with this so-called adaptation.  I say \\"so-called\\" because this film isn't really adapted as simply transfered, uncreatively, from one artistic medium to another.  Nothing is changed from the comic book, except there are less boobs.  Whereas the comic book is creative and artistic, the movie is one long cartoon that plays the same thing over and over again. Its predictable, the dialogue is corny (because as good as it may sound in your head reading off the page, hearing from actors attempting to make it sound serious is cliche, boring, and, again, corny).  The violence is cartoonish, at best, and with the exception of Mickey Rourke, I couldn't stand a single actor in this film, no matter how sexy she might be, or how believable as a tough guy he might be.  The plots are not to be questioned, but instead how they are arranged.  I think this movie could have been more watchable if the scenes between plots were intercut, instead of just showing one right after another.  Instead of waiting to see what happens next, I was just waiting for the ending.  When I first read the comic about 9 years ago, I thought they'd make a great series of film noir tales.  Instead of trying to do something creative, or re-visit the long overlooked genre of film noir, Rodriguez instead took the easy way out and decided to instead plaster Miller's material on to a film reel.  I don't care how many people die, or how cool it looks, this film is totally unnecessary.  If I wanted to watch a 2 hour comic book, I'd just go ahead and read the comic book.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Well, I was a little sceptical to buy this album to being with.  Admittedly, I've wanted it for a year, but the \\"Explicit Lyrics\\" sticker was a little intimidating.  Apparently I've cheated myself out of a year of great music.      1. American Idiot- very classic Green Day.  Lots of guitar, very fast, and a really good way to get into the album.  I admit that doing a conceptual album was a great idea, especially considering that they only wrote this one because their original album got stolen (so I've heard).  This song really lets you know what the rest of the CD will be about.      2. Jesus of Suburbia- could definately be called a \\"rock opera,\\" seeing as how it's got five parts and is over nine minutes long.  The transitions between the songs are great, and the individual songs are all different enough so that you know when a new idea is being offered up.  Great melodies and instrumentation, as well.      3. Holiday- I love this song.  The beginning is one of those where you recognize it the instant that it's played, the lyrics are great, and you don't get tired of it.  Also a very catchy bass line during the bridge.      4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams- I'll admit it, this was the song that first got me interested in the album.  While it certainly is a lot tamer than some of Green Day's older stuff, it has a great guitar solo and fits in well with the mood of the album.      5. Are We The Waiting?- Definately single-worthy material, although it is a bit short.  Showcases Billie Joe Armstrong's vocals quite a bit more than the fast songs, and it is very tame.  Beautiful melody, and the choir-like chorus is amazing.      6. St. Jimmy- Yes, it's fast.  Yes, it's got a lot of guitars.  Hey, they had to have a couple of these on the album!  The sound changes dramatically about halfway through, but that just adds to the song.      7. Give Me Novacain- Another slower song that shows off the vocals a bit more.  I love the guitar slides after the first verse, and the guitar solo.  A very cool song.      8. She's a Rebel- More vintage Green Day.  Good melody, especially in the chorus, and nice harmonies at the end.      9. Extraordinary Girl- Quote: \\"Oh no!  It's the Beatles!\\" The beginning harmonies might be able to pass for that, but once you get into the chorus, it gets a lot rock-ier, especially in the beginning of it.  Interesting guitar melodies, and the sitar adds a lot, too.      10. Letterbomb- Admittedly one of my favorite songs on the album.  I love how it changes from one person's POV to another about 2/3's of the way through, as you'll see if you look at the liner.  Great melody, interesting arrangement of verse/chorus, definately not standard.      11. Wake Me Up When September Ends- Another great song.  I love how the bass and drums come in a little later, and the melody is awesome.  Great guitar solo, as well.      12. Homecoming- Another nine minute long song, and, while not as good as \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" the end song is quite epic in it's sound, and at least we're giving some of the rest of the band a chance to sing.  As a saxophone player, I love the addition of that to \\"Rock and Roll Girlfriend.\\"      13. Whatsername- Another slower song, with a lot of palm-muted guitar.  It has a bit of a different sound, but it's great none-the-less, and a cool way to end an awesome CD.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Ah, The Beatles. The best band ever. They're still talked about and experienced over 40 years later. Kids today are still sitting in sandboxes, asking each other who their favorite Beatle is. Yes, this is a great CD, but it leaves alot to be desired. I got this myself in late 2000 when my father gave it to me, and I was 11 then (16 years old now). After I popped this CD in, I became a huge Beatles fan. Afterwards, I had to have all of their albums, and over time, I've recieved all of their albums. This CD has most of their number 1 hits, it's missing a few (of course, other reviewers mentioned this). This compilation doesn't shed any light on The White Album (\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is an FM radio staple, and yet it's not on here?!), or even Sgt. Pepper at all, and only has three songs from Magical Mystery Tour, which is sad, especially when you hear these albums for yourself. Anyway, buy this and experience The Beatles for yourself, or better yet, buy this CD for your children to help shy them away from the CRAP! that is on MTV and the radio nowadays (Trust me older fans, music of yesteryear is not only refreshing, but bands back then had talent. I'd rather have The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin rather than Good Charlotte, Linkin Park, and Limp Bizkit anyday!). I recommend you or your child start out with this, then you or your child should progress to Revolver and The White Album, and move on from there.
B00005JNTX|3.0|This was one of the best comic-to-screen adaptions I have ever seen. Miller and Rodriguez brought together a stellar cast and seamlessly tied together three different stories of the same city that perfectly captures the mood and noir of the comic. The other reviews here can sing it's praises far better than I can, so I'll just get down to the point.<br /><br />Rodriguez has stated in interviews that the first release of the movie will be bare-bones and will contain little special features and no additional footage (It'll just be what you saw in theaters). I'm the kind of person who would be upset to pay to buy this movie only to have a better version come out a few months later (which seems likely to happen). So if you're like me, I would hold off on this for awhile until the Special Edition comes out with extended footage and the full special features load. But this is a movie that is DEFINITELY worth having a place in every collection, so if stuff like additional movie footage and special features doesn't bother you, then by all means buy it. But don't say I didn't warn you.
B0002858YS|4.0|First of all, I really like their sound.  They have some interesting songs and the synth/pop/rock is a unique way to bring out an album in the days where rap and pop tarts rule.  Their songs are creative, catchy, and very appealing to people of all ages.  For anybody who wants a more detailed review, I'll also review the songs so you know more about what they sound like.   <br /> <br />1. Jenny was a Friend of Mine- a great way to start off an album!  Very catchy, great vocals, and a very cool synth solo at the end.   <br /> <br />2. Mr. Brightside- well, it's hard not to sing along to this one.  Despite the fact that the song is essentially the same thing twice, the interludes are different, and, for an American, lead singer Brandon Flowers sounds extremely British, which I find kind of cool.   <br /> <br />3. Smile Like You Mean It- Another good song.  The synth line is repeated often, but it doesn't take away from the song, and the ending is great.   <br /> <br />4. Somebody Told Me- Let's face it.  Find me somebody who can't sing along to the chorus of this one.  Their first real single, it was the reason I noticed them, and it's still one of the best on the album.   <br /> <br />5. All These Things That I've Done- This song is definately taken at a slower pace to begin with, but the guitar interlude is great, as is the rest of the song.  The choir on the later parts adds a lot, and I like how the rest of the instruments fade out, leaving only the drums to end.   <br /> <br />6. Andy, You're A Star- Well, my father had been listening for about a grand total of four seconds before he started tapping along to the beginning, so it's very easy to pick up.  The idea for the song is kind of odd, almost stalker-esque, but, again, the choir helps to pick up the ending.   <br /> <br />7. On Top- I quote, \\"Oh no!  Euro synth-pop!\\" Which is exactly what the beginning sounds like.  The song is alright, and I like how the sound changes often during the bridge.   <br /> <br />8. Change Your Mind- I actually like this song.  It may not be as good as some of the other ones on the album, but still very singable, and the melody is good.   <br /> <br />9. Believe Me, Natalie- Definately one of the weaker songs.  Very repetitious and stiff, and the melody really doesn't change throughout.   <br /> <br />10. Midnight Show- A good pick-me-up after some slower stuff.  Great vocals, again, and another good melody.  I like how the synth fades out at the end.   <br /> <br />11. Everything Will Be Alright- I've only really listened to this song once.  Very long, very slow, and, for some reason, Brandon sounds like he's underwater the entire time.  ???    <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great debut effort for a band that's only been together a couple of years, and I look forward to new material.   <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|I am a big Harry Potter fan. I saw this movie before I read the book, and I greatly enjoyed it.  After reading the book, I saw that there were more differences between the movie and the book than in Harry Potter 1 and 2, but I thought the changes made for a more exciting movie, and the film stays true to the heart of the book.  A fantastic movie in my opinion.
0553106635|5.0|I have read nearly ever fantasy saga or series on the market, from Jordan to Anthony to Goodkind, and more.  And never once in my prolific reading career have I been so curious as to search, find, and read chapter summaries at work!  Each of the three books in this series is captivating and enthralling.  Martin has set the benchmark beyond the reach of almost the entire field of current fantasy writers today. I highly recommend the series.   <br /> <br />The best thing about Martin is the way he twists your arm painfully behind your back and, somehow, makes you enjoy it.  Because there is no way you are happy with his decisions, but they move the story forward and still manage to enchant you with every chapter.  Hooray for fantasy, it has finally produced a mature, adult series of novels that leaves the childishness of fairies in the dust....
B00003CXMG|5.0|Great story with an awesome cast of characters.  Frances McDormand plays the great mom character trying to keep her kids safe and sound while one runs off to be a stewardess to get away from her, the other winds up on the road with a band writing an article for Rolling Stone magazine.  The magazine editors have never met him and don't realize he's only a teenager.  The band winds up denying the story he's written at first but then tells Rolling Stone that it was all true.  But the real story is in the journey of the band, the boy, his mother, his sister and of the \\"band aids\\".
0064407667|4.0|I'm not too big on children's books because of their constant immaturity, but these books are wise beyond their selected age group. While these books were meant more for a younger crowd, I discovered this when I was 14 years old and I thought it was excellent, though at some points I could see where it got its label as a childrens' book, because there are points where it begins to explain things too much. But one of the books main attractions is its unsettling pessimistic attitude, which is obvious throughout this book and the following volumes in the series. But it's just that which makes these books so interesting, because as you read through and form a connection to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, you start to feel an overwhelming sense of pity for their situation. Not only did their parents die in a fire, they soon learn that an evil actor named Count Olaf is desperate to get their vast fortune and will stop at nothing to obtain it. To make matters worse, Mr. Poe, the one in charge of their fortune and ultimately their fate, doesn't seem to realize what's going on and this obvliviousness is what causes most of the orphans' problems. But through it all, the three siblings connect with each other and realize that as long as they have each other, they can make it through anything. But under the main storyline is a hidden secret about the Baudelaire family and the fact that one of their parents may, in fact, still be alive. But don't take my word for it. This book may seem like nothing special by just reading a summary, but once you've finished the first book, you'll most likely want to continue on through the rest of this Series of Unfortunate Events.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|This is one of the few Debney scores not written for a kid's movie. It is a deep, violent soundtrack. It is very passionately written, well constructed and mathematical. <br /> <br />The only complaint is the lack of highlight songs. Many of these songs are merely underscoring, \\"although they are very good.\\" The major highlights are Mary Goes To Jesus, and Ressurection, although all are good, those two will have you stunned. <br /> <br />Awesome soundtrack to an awesome movie.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|If you liked the DVD version of Celtic Women, you should enjoy this CD.  It has all the songs from the DVD version except the song, \\"I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls.\\"
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Watch this DVD and all of you're wildest dreams will come true. It has alot of sweet scenes, and amazing acting, it's pretty sweet. It's awesome, it's, it's incredible!    So watch this DVD, I promise you, you won't be dissapointed.    So uh, how does the Delio sound to you?
B00005AAFS|5.0|I would have to say that this is definently one of my favorite CDs. the top three songs in my mind are hard to pick but ill try <br />1.Adios- i love the riff in the middle, it was amazing <br />2. Mein Herz Brent- i love the transition from orchaestral with a boom to the metal <br />3.Nebel - i love this song to, its just so creepy, yet majestic in a way <br /> <br />Basically if u love german metal, and some orchaestra this cd is for u.....i love this cd, and all of Rammsteins work, go out there, and be evil
B000A6T1KE|5.0|I thought this was great, although I was a bit saddened by one of the main character's death. It was surprising to say the least.  <br /> <br />I found this film incredibly fun, action packed, and exciting.
0812966066|5.0|When I began the book, I thought it would be slow going because it was written about 100 years ago. I was SO wrong! I finished the book in a period of less than 24 hours!!! This is an absolutely fabulous book! Doyle's use of language is masterful, and you are swept away to the moor with its swamps, jagged cliffs, and massive hills. I can honestly say I was quite spooked as I was reading some of it at night!<br /><br />Since this is the first novel I have ever read by Doyle, I didn't know what to expect. But the twists in the plot and the constant itching to know what was going to happen next had me hooked!<br /><br />I watched the 1959 movie after reading this, and I have to say it was a disgrace. I don't know if I would be happy seeing any of the versions, only because I don't know if any of them could even compare to the rich world and language used by Doyle to transport you to Devonshire!! But of course, the book is always better than the movie. :)
B00004SWBS|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS CD THE SAME DAY I BOUGHT CATTLE DECAPITATIONS TO SERVE MAN CD. THIS CD IS AMAZING ITS A COMPLETE MASTERPEICE FROM BEGINNING TO END. EACH SONG IS TRULEY A MASTERPEICE ENCLUDING MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD \\"CHRISTIAN WOMAN\\". PICK THIS UP NOW!!!!!!

B000001Y2U|5.0|I just started listening to Manson.  Before i started listening to him, I didn't care for him at all.  So my bro got me to listen to him and damnit, i cant put the stuff down!  Manson is a group of talented individuals and Marilyn himself is a Wonderful lyricist.  He isnt like most of the artists nowadays who talk about smokin people in the hood or crying about their girlfriends dumping them.  In all of his albums you will find him talking about problems in our society and how messed up life is.   <br />But anyways, Go and get this ALBUM!  It is Awesome and is produced by a Genious, Trent Reznor!

B0000A118M|5.0|I bought this album two days ago, and I'm still trying to take it all in. At first I was aprehensive about there only being four songs, but not any more. I'm beating around the bush here, so I'll cut to the chase. This is quite possibly the best piece of music I have ever heard. This is better than (in my humble opinion)Kind of Blue, the Brandenburgh Concertos, Avalanche by Matthew Good, or Mellon Collie and the infinite sadness. I only seriously started listening to jazz less than a year ago, but right away I latched on to Monk and Davis (because I play piano and trumpet), not to mention Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. I first heard Jhon Coltrne on the Essential Miles Davis on \\"So What\\" and was blwon away. I picked up Kind of Blue and in my opinion, Coltrane dominates the entire album. Naturaly I went and got \\"A Love Supreme\\", it being widely regarded as his masterpeice. Each of the four tracks is stunning and unique. The diverse introduction of \\"Aknowledgement\\", the urbane, slightley bluesey feel of \\"Resolution\\", the breathtaking energy of \\"Pursuance\\", and the almost orchestral climaxe of \\"Psalm\\". All in all, this is a slice of pure joy. <br /> <br />A note to the person who gave one star saying this was old music for old people and complained about the lack of guitars: I'm fifteen years old, and I enjoy \\"screaming guitars\\" (if it's actulay well done) If you were expecting guitars, what were you thinking: this is jazz, not heavy metal.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish does it again with another CD, \\"Once\\". I have bought all of Nightwish CDs and I regret nothing. If you're into metal, yet beautiful metal at that, I suggest trying Nightwish. It will change your life.
B000002N2P|5.0|Insomniac is considered a disappointment following the phenomenal success of Dookie, thanks to the singles When I Come Around, Longview, and Basket Case. However, I feel this is Green Day's best album! This was recorded at the most frantic, crazy and intense time in the band's history. And it shows! <br />Mike Dirnt was suffering panic and anxiety attacks on a regular basis becuse he thought there was something wrong with his heart, Billie Joe was trying to grasp being a frontman in a popular rock band, Tre Cool was, well, Tre Cool, the whole band was suffering an addiction to the drug speed and actually had to have a touring drug therapist come on tour with them in 95 - 96 to help them kick the habit.  <br />This whole album is their darkest, snottiest, hardest and fastest. <br />Songs like Panic Song, Geek Stink Breath and the only real popular song on the album, Brain Stew/Jaded, are good examples of a band that is suddenly extreamly famous and isn't sure how to handle it. Songs like Stuart And The Avenue, Stuck With Me and Armitage Shanks, tell the oft-told story of punks with broken hearts and the songs Brat and Walking Contradiction are just straight up bratty punk rock.  <br />Although Green Day has universally been considered pop-punk and for good reason, Insomniac, if released by any other band, wouldn't for second be lumped in to that category. This album finds the band making music more atune to the likes of snot punk legends, Screeching Weasel, The Queers and Descendents. (All of which Green Day has cited as influences on their music) <br />It may have been a critical letdown, but Insomniac represents the very best of snotty punk rock fury!
B00005JCAA|5.0|Fabulously shot and directed movie. If you are a Brad Pitt fan you will enjoy this movie a lot. His acting skills are better than I expected. Of course Anthony Hopkins is fabulous as always in his role as wealthy business man William Parish. And guys the British-born actress Claire Forlani is very sexy in her role as Doctor Susan Parish. The gist of the movie is that William Parish is dying but death's agent personified as Joe Black (Brad Pitt) wants to have a \\"tour\\" and chooses Mr. Parish as his \\"guide\\" because of the exemplary life he has lead, because of his \\"verb\\". But nobody planned on Joe falling for Susan.<br /><br />A part of the movie I enjoyed was Joe Black's exchange with a Jamaican woman in the hospital. It was very funny. Also Brad's Jamaican accent was right on. Like I said before he really surprised me. Maybe he really is not just a pretty face. Who knew?
0446677450|2.0|Although there were some good things in the book (enouh to fill a page or two...) the overall attitude departed by the author was one of contempt for the middle class.  What a jerk!  He continually blasts the middle class for the way they live.  What he fails to realize is that they live the way they do because they really aren't trying to be rich, just comfortable.  It was extremely hard to get past his attitude and absorb the information he gives.  But to summarize the bulk of the worthwhile info he does give: <br /> <br />1) An asses is soemthing that yields revenue.  Your home costs money and is not truly an asset. <br /> <br />2) Earn the money to buy a desire, don't just go out and borrow money to buy it.  If you don't have cash then don't buy it. <br /> <br />3) Don't waste your money buying this book.  Just get it from the library or bank.
6305364648|5.0|This movie is an absolute BLAST!!!  Usually I don't care much for action movies, but this one definitely took the taco!  The special effects are definitely special, considering this movie was made in 1994.  And actually, the whole nuclear arms smuggling/Arab terrorism is a terrible foreshadowing, if you think about it; some of the action toward the end of the movie actually mirrors the events of 9/11. <br /> <br />Anyhow, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold are simply hilarious.  Jamie Lee Curtis (as the first Arnold's wife) won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy for her role in this one, and she does not disappoint.  She doesn't disappoint in the sex department, either; from what I understand she required NO body doubles.  And veteran actor Charlton Heston has an agreeable cameo. <br /> <br />This is surely a crowd-pleasing movie across the board; it has something for everyone.  Highly imaginative and well-executed; many notches above the tripe they hand us in the mid-2000s.
0778321606|4.0|This book was recommended by someone from a knitting group I am a member of. As I am an avid knitter, and love to read romances, I could not stop myself from ordering it.  <br /> <br />The book reminded me of my favorite childhood romantic books, a slow paced book, that, when you close it makes you feel all fuzzy and warm inside.  <br /> <br />The characters were well fleshed out, albeit slightly two dimensional in some cases. I really look forward to reading the sequel to this book.  <br /> <br />The only thing that bothered me, was the religion seeping through in the pages. It wasn't a reason to stop reading for me, though, and I am glad I finished the book. I really look forward to meeting these characters again in the sequel.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This was the movie where I first noticed what a great actor Johnny Depp was.  The whole story had such a great message.  Between the brother and the slow girl and boy, it just showed how much compassion and understanding can mean in peoples lives.  It is a movie that stayed in my heart forever and I will always watch over and over.  There is just not enough movies like  this.
B00001U0DP|5.0|My sister in law recommended this film to my wife and I and we went to the theater to see it. She did not mention that is was subtitled and I was initially so put off that I almost left the theater. So glad that I did not.  <br /> <br />\\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It is deeply emotional on all levels and brings home the terrible truth that was the Holocaust. But much more than that, the movie is a deep reflection of all that is best in humanity, and our ability to find joy and love even in the darkest of situations. It touches deeply the spiritual nature of laughter and the amazing, omipotent, world changing power of Love.  <br /> <br />I recommend seeing this film in its original Italian. As another reviewer said, reading the subtitles becomes simple as you are caught up in films depiction of WWII Italy.  <br /> <br />\\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is a film that will profoundly change you.
0515123447|4.0|Jack Reacher has spent the six months after being \\"downsized\\" out of the army avoiding work and shunning \\"official\\" society.  He buys his clothes to wear for a few days, buys more and discards the old ones.  It's a new definition of traveling light.<br /><br />Near Atlanta, he remembers a story about the death of Blind Blake, the guitar player, which Reacher's brother had written about.  In a sudden impulse, Reacher persuades the bus driver to drop him off near Margrave, Georgia, the site of Blake's death.<br /><br />Coincidences quickly multiply as Reacher becomes the \\"usual suspect\\" for a brutal murder that occurs just before he arrives in the area.  Wheels move within wheels as his fellow prisoner tells him that there's a dangerous conspiracy going on . . . and that it most be broken by Sunday.<br /><br />Reacher uses his skills as a former MP to keep himself and others safe, and finds himself tasked to the limits of his abilities.<br /><br />The book has some of the best hand-to-hand action you can imagine in a thriller.  The plot has some marvelous concepts floating around in it.  Above all, the book is fun to read.  Reacher will appeal to readers who like lonely rebels and vigilantes who right wrongs.<br /><br />The novel has some rough patches in the story.  Some of the coincidences are a bit far-fetched.  If you are good at suspending disbelief, you will probably rate this book higher than I did.  Some of the imagery is a trifle on the gruesome side, so the book isn't for those with squeamish tastes.  The ending doesn't quite work, but it didn't harm my enjoyment of the story too much.<br /><br />Pay attention to the Blind Blake story line.  It's one of the stronger elements in the book.<br /><br />Make a difference!
B00006LI4S|5.0|If you've seen Pink Floyd in concert (or their concert videos), this is quite different.  I am a huge David Gilmour fan, and I think this is a fantastic DVD.  Some of the performances with special guests are lackluster, but it's fun to hear Gilmour's song selection when he isn't fronting Pink Floyd.  Of course there are PF songs (including some early material), but there's other songs that have no association with him at all that he just liked, apparently. <br /> <br />The guitar playing is more intimate than his work with Pink Floyd.  There's less signal processing and effects at work, and there's definately a roughness to the sound that you don't hear on any PF album. <br /> <br />All told, a great DVD of a true guitar master.

0141301155|5.0|this book is the greatest kids book ever !!! its all so a good book for adults.this book is about a kid named charlie bucket who finds a golden ticket and gets to go to wonka's amazing chocolate factory. he sent out 5 golden tickests and who ever finds them they get to come in.the five people that found the tickets are.... augustus glup,violet beaurogurd,mike teevee,veruca salt and ofcource charlie bucket.inside the factory they find lots of supprises like everlasting gobstoppers,square candies that look round, fizzy lifting drinks, and alot more.at the end wonka gives his factory to charlie. then they go pick up all of charlies grandparents and his mom and dad .and they all live in the factory.   if you liked the book you should go watch the movies  the old verson and the new verson.    the old one was with gene wilder and was a gret movie but back then they couldnt get all the things from the book  so they made new made up stuff in some parts.this film is so amazing all the actors did a great job ( especilly gene wilder as willy wonka) but its mostly the same from the book. this is for adults and kids out of ten i would give the old verson 10/10    on the other hand the new verson starrs johnny depp its exactly like the book and has all the new effects they couldnt have back then so its kind of different then the old one.but its mostly the same. all the actors did a great job ( especilly johnny depp as willy wonka) this is kind of  mostly for kids because the humor is pretty good for a kid to watch. and this wouldnt be as great for adults. for adults i recomend the old verson. and the ommpa loopas are much different from the old verson.out of ten i would give this 9.5/10    overall charlie and the chocolate factory is an amazing book and every body must read it its great for kids. alot of credit goes to roald dahl because he came up with this brilliant idea.  overall i would give the book 10/10!!!!!  cheack out the movies and the book.  (read the book first beforeyou watch the film for the ultimate experince) or just watch the film you decide!!!!!!!!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|'Requiem' is my first experience with the Kronos Quartet, and what an experience.  I'm locked in, an avid fan of anyone who can produce music this dark and dreary, while still providing enough energy licks to pull the knife away from my wrist occasionally.<br /><br />Goth may be dark at times, and The Cure owns the field for exasperating despair and loneliness in their music, but 'Requiem' takes Dark to a new level.  This is an original score, no lyrics to tease you into the direction the artist wants you to go, simply music that reaches out its shadowy hand and pulls you into the pit with it.<br /><br />'Requiem' has managed to paint the languid contentment of heroin highs alongside the razor-shivering anguish of withdrawals, the racy ecstasy of diet-pill mania and the nightmarish paranoia of medication-induced delusions.  This score has painted the spiral of addiction into notes of realism rarely found in a musical score, using a unique form of what I like to call \\"Classical Electronica\\".<br /><br />You will actually feel the hopelessness and despair, will pace as far as your headphones allow, wondering if this world is worth living in.  I can't say enough good things about this powerful Score, other than you had better be a fan of dark music before picking up a copy.  Otherwise, you might find a knife pressed to your wrist.  Enjoy!
B0006GAOCW|3.0|I thought the movie was great and very enjoyable. I love good old fashion, cutesy love stories.  I have watched it about 4 times in the last week and it is just an adorable movie.  I have taped it and plan to share it with others.  I particularly liked the ballroom dancing scenes.  The romance is innocent and engaging.  With all the blood, guts, guns and over-the-top violence that we're seeing in today's movies, it's good to have this heart-warming movie as a reminder that life can still be beautiful.  Please tell me if there is a soundtrack available--the music was great as well.  Thanks
6305841861|5.0|This movie is a classic, as are part 1 and Army of Darkness. It's ridiculous and over the top, but in a good way. The cheesey effects and absurdity of this film are what make it great. It's similar to the first one, but it's way more over the top this time around. This is the film where Ash starts to become a bada$$, when he attaches a chainsaw to his arm. This film was meant to be over the top and people who rate it poorly because of that don't know what they're talking about.   Just look at the reviews written by HorrorMan on here. This guy has written pages and pages of reviews about horror films and can never make a point. He bases his reviews on whether or not the film is really a horror film. If he doesn't like a horror movie he says that it's not horror and rates it badly. And he even admits some movies are good but not as horror films, so he rates them poorly. One example is his review of Interview with the Vampire. He gave this movie one star because he says it wasn't scary and because vampires were depicted as being sympathetic and having emotions. He says vampires have no emotions, that they're just savage killers. First of all he's way off. Vampires are extremely passionate and emotional people. They ARE human. He has no idea what he's talking about. And second of all, it's not meant to be scary, so don't use that as a reason. HorrorMan rated Evil Dead 2 as one star because it's cheesey and has funny moments. This guy should have all his reviews deleted. They're illogical, poorly written, and he always adds to his reviews something like \\"Some people call this a horror movie. I call it rubbish.\\" Try to say something original for a change. A horror movie CAN BE BAD. And just because a movie isn't necessarily a horror movie but has horror elements DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL YOUR PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT A HORROR MOVIE SHOULD HAVE. All you do is say stuff like \\"this movie isn't scary\\" etc. Your gripe is that Evil Dead 2 is placed in the horror section at stores. SO WHAT??? So you are saying if this was in the comedy section then you wouldn't rate it with one star? You are illogical. You have these preconceived notions that you think all horror movies should have, and then judge the movies based on that. All your reviews are flawed. You actually think Interview with the Vampire was meant to be a pure horror fillm? It's a drama. Stop writing reviews about movies that aren't horror films necessarily and judging them based on typical horror movie elements. That's like if I were to write a review about Schindler's List and say \\"This is a good movie but it doesn't work well as a comedy.\\" None of your reviews offer anything worth reading. I can't believe I actually read many of yours. They are all the same. You almost never say anything specific about the movie. You just spew your hatred of a movie and then claim it's not a horror movie because you think it's bad or because you don't think it works well as a horror movie (which makes no sense).     Hopefully your next review will contain something worthy, rather than your usual nonsense, pretending to sound intelligent when you are saying nothing at all about the film. You said \\"The movie \\"Evil Dead II\\" contains too much lame comedy and extremely ridiculous creatures plus outrageous gore scenes to be effective as a \\"pure\\" horror movie.\\" SO WHAT? Okay so it is not pure horror. WHAT IS YOUR POINT? Just because it's not pure horror doesn't mean it's not a good film. Complaining about Evil Dead 2 being too outrageous is like complaining about a comic book movie not being realistic.   I don't care what genre anyone places this movie in; it's great. \\"In my opinion, this is a poor movie as far as the horror movie genre is concerned.\\" Your illogical reviews are so full of crap. It's a horror movie with comedic elements. Get over it. If you don't like the fact it has elements that aren't \\"pure horror\\" (whatever that means) then don't rate it. Obviously you hate movies that aren't imaginative and add something new. You just want your standard one-dimensional film that's just like so many others. If you don't think this movie is a horror film, and you only rate horror movies, then don't rate it. We don't need people like you lowering the score just because you think it's bad for the genre. All your reviews are about one thing: whether the movie is good as a horror film or not. You are incapable of looking past the restrictions of a genre and actually rate the film with your own ideas. You only use the genre as a basis for review. Now back to the movie...  One reason I love this movie is because it widens the genre. It actually makes bad effets look good! I'm pretty sure the director intended it to be over the top and campy and have corny dialogue and effects. All these elements enhance the film. I am not sure if this film was the first horror movie which was intended to be comical and ridiculous, but it's so effective in that regard that I think it can be labelled as the first successful one (correct me if I'm wrong). Bruce Campbell is excellent in this movie. There's a point where he goes from being scared and unsure to taking control of the situation and this is when the humor jumps up a notch. This type of film just doesn't seem to be made anymore. The 70s and 80s were the classic era for horror films. The Evil Dead series is a gem. You don't have to watch part 1 to understand this film. It's so outrageous and over the top. All the crazy looking demons, possessed trees, and enourmous amounts of blood coming out of nowhere...priceless! This movie will surely entertain you.
B0009P42S2|4.0|Overlong and uneven but with production this staggering it's useless to carp.  Imaginative, insightful story-line is given emotional depth thanks to film's charming protagonist (well voiced by Anna Paquin) and Steve Jabonsky's rousing score.  A must for animation enthusiasts and a welcome return from veteran anime/manga artist Otomo who is at the peak of his powers.  This special Director's Cut edition is 14 minutes shorter than its original theatrical release.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City has all of it: a good story, excellent cast (a cast of who's who) and the best part is the cinematography. Not since Dick Tracy 15 years ago has a comic book looked so good on the big screen. The colors of the comics comes alive in Rodrigues's movie.
B000093BDX|4.0|This is the album that wonderfully and lovingly gives us the best of the Beach Boys.This is great, a sequentially ordered regurgitation of each of their releases, most of them, of course, monster hits. It is all here, folks, from the original number \\"Surfing Safari'\\" to \\"Surfer Girl\\", from \\"Catch A Wave\\" (which Jan and Dean later stole the melody and chord progressions for \\"Sidewalk Surfing\\", a major hit for them) to \\"The Warmth Of The Sun\\". yet the Beach Boys really weren't about surfing or even the relaxed southern California lifestyle.<br /><br />What they were really all about was feel-good music, a kind of instant nostalgia for a Hollywood-type confection. While I have always loved listening to Beach Boy music, I have never taken any of their music seriously, at least not in the way one would consider the Beatles or any of a number of singer-songwriters. Instead, Brian Wilson's music is formulaic, but brilliantly so, a superb if sugary confection of great tunes, easy, sing-along lyrics, and a pronounced beat. It was rock and roll, produced for commercial success, and it was wildly successful.<br /><br />From \\"Surfing USA\\" to \\"In My Room\\", from \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" to \\"I Get Around\\", From \\"Wendy\\" to \\"Don't Worry Baby\\", this is great music, fun to listen to, and something you find yourself humming all day after hearing it on the radio. My favorites here are \\"California Girls\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\". This is an album you will want to keep around for background music, for it is a wonderful sound and reminds us all of a more wonderful time in our long lost youth. Enjoy!
B00005QEO1|5.0|In 1985 Aerosmith released Done With Mirrors which was suppost to be their comback album, while it didnt get the attention they hoped for it was still one hell of an album. In 1987 Aerosmith released Permenant Vacation the largely successful album that was their comback album, while a very good album it was not like anything the band had ever done before, it was very pop and featured some outside writers on the songs. In 1989 Aerosmith released this, Pump which at the time was Aerosmiths biggest selling album. This wasnt as pop as the album before it but it still gave birth to many hit singles, 'Love In An Elevator,' 'Janies Got A Gun,' 'The Other Side' and 'What It Takes' all became Aerosmith classics.<br /><br />The album opens up with the sexualy charged 'Young Lust' which features fast tempo beats and even faster guitar riffs. After 'Young Lust' we go right into 'F.I.N.E.' which is another sexual number, featuring some down right naughty lyrics that only the great Steven Tyler could create. Now the next song is why people must own the album, when you buy a greatest hits package or a best of, of Aerosmith you dont get the intro's on these songs on Pump. 'Goin' Down' is a classic monolougue that is featured in the video for 'Love In An Elevator'. This song is one of Aerosmith's all time best and  becoming one of their all time biggest hits, and to this day a concert staple, I'd know I've seen them five times. The three minute guitar solo during this song proves once and for all why Joe Perry is the all time greatest guitarist to ever play! 'Monkey On My Back' was a minor hit for Aerosmith that everyone claims to love but can never remember the words to the song when they play it live. This is a classic song that shows some excelent vocals by Tyler and killer slide guitar work by Perry. 'Water Song' is the cool little intro into 'Janies Got A Gun' which is Steven Tyler and bass player Tom Hamiltons song about sexual abuse in America, this became a massive hit but isnt performed live that much for obvious reasons. Killer Guitar Solo, one of Perry's all time best. 'Dulcimer Stomp' is the intro to 'The Other Side' which is a Motown cover by the band that they truly make all their own, I am one of Aerosmith's biggest fans and I thought this was their own song untill I heard my mom listening to the original one day. Killer guitar solo! 'My Girl' is the most commercial song on the album, it's kinda rock a billy and motowna at the same time, but the band pulls it off wonderfully. The next song took me while to like, 'Dont' Get Mad, Get Even' is a great song, in fact it is one of the better tracks on the album and I dont know why it took me so long to like it. The next song features some of the very best guitar playing you will ever hear, 'Hoodoo/Voodoo Madicine Man' is a great song, of all the songs Aerosmith didnt release as singles this is the all time best, easily would have been a hit. The guitar riff is so amazing I get chills every time I hear it! The album comes to a close with, what a surprize another hit single, 'What It Takes' is a beautiful-sappy ballad that features some of Steven Tyler's all time best vocals, as well as some nice bass and rythym guitar by Hamilton And Whitford. The slow restrained drumming of Joey Kramer gives this song a nice touch as well, this was definatley the best song to close the album with.<br /><br />This at the time of it's release was Aerosmith biggest seller and it's easy to see why, it was the bands best album in over a decade, and it was way better then the next album, Get A Grip. Do your self a favor if you are classic rock fan or just and Aerosmith fan and pick up this killer record!isnt performed live that much for obvious reasons.

B000002KHF|5.0|... that i'd have to keep in my entire collection, i've little doubt that it would be this folk/jazz inspired gem.    creativity in artists peak at a particular point in time of their artistic evolution. for van morrison it apparently sustained well beyond his prior relfective masterpiece astral weeks. moondance is that rare album where for the artist everything comes together - it is the midas touch where everything that the artist touches/does turns to gold.    this album is about all the positive things in life - discovery, happiness, fond memories, pleasant experiences, love, hope, substance/spirit etc. maybe that period of morrison's life was happy enough for him to plumb it and channel it into this album (the harsh realities of life would surface in later albums).    the nostalgic \\"and it stoned me\\" kicks of the album. the romantic \\"moondance\\", the delicate love ditty \\"crazy love\\", the rollicking \\"caravan\\", the masterpiece amongst masterpieces - \\"into the mystic\\", the hopeful \\"come running\\", the soulful \\"brand new day\\" - and so the album flows belting out one gem after another. the mood osciallates between the playful/hopeful/energetic and the reflective/meditative, inspired by images of village/country life(?). inspired sax solos, probing flute play, subtle acoustic/electric jazz guitar, a warm intelligent bass and energetic drumming, play the able foil to morrison's inspired singing.    when i bought my b&w nautilus speakers, it was the pleasure/experience of hearing the foghorn (trombone?) blowing in \\"into the mystic\\" which convinced me to shell out the money for those highend speakers. if you've not heard this album, i envy you - for this is divine pleasure in waiting!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Known and unknown #1 songs of this great band! Plus an interesting statistics on which song was where and for how long #1. You will see how different music/song tastes Americans and British had! There are songs that British loved and Americans hardly knew and vice versa. It's an interesting set of songs while driving or cooking.
B00007KMP1|1.0|The pits. Sold it after two listens. The impeccably recorded sound of someone attempting suicide in a tub of warm slush. Not even impressive as bummer albums go. This is so far off from why anyone began listening to him...I mean, he was fun, right? We didn't expect him to actually say anything, did we? Oh? You did? This is the result. I'm truly amazed at how many people got off on this. I dunno, maybe you bought into it being a breakup record. At least he was honest titling it \\"Sea Change\\". Indeed.     Oh, the Amazon editor is out of his gourd even comparing this to \\"Mutations\\", which is an excellent record. Go ahead, keep hitting that \\"unhelpful\\" button. That won't take away from the fact that you gleefully paid money to hear someone mope aboout their misery in a startlingly uninteresting way.

0684843749|5.0|i think all those guys preaching overtraining and danger to cause injury to follow arnold's advice,are nothin but girls. Of course there are possibilties of injury, but hey! try to be safe!! i.e. make behind the neck pressing and pulldown moves real controlled and slow. To be great at sports you have to make sacrifice...thats what i think...great book...great exercises and overall good history of the sport!!
B00082IJ08|1.0|The one and only good thing about this band is the design of the anime alter-egos of the band members. Of course, the band didn't create that impressive art that's used to market themselves in their music videos and CD packaging, so I suppose there really isn't anything good that this band has to offer. At least GWAR made their own costumes. The fact that any musical group has to hide behind cartoon alter-egos of themselves makes you wonder why they have do it. But when you hear Gorallaz' music, it's obvious: Their music is boring and mediocre.     Gorillaz just want to be Fishbone. It's a shame that Fishbone, being one of the most talented, ever-evolving, and creative band of black musicians ever to grace the music world, never got this kind of attention. Too bad none of you know about them, because if you did, you'd be listening to them instead of Gorallaz. Have a taste for Funk/Punk/Heavy Metal? Then get Give a Monkey a Brain. Have a taste for Ska/Power Pop? Get Fishbone's s/t album and Truth & Soul. I guarantee you won't come back to Demon Days.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|There has been a recent fad of cross-platform pop-culture stars emerging onto the music scene, and as of late there haven't really  been any respectable results. From Disney soaked offerings (such as Hilary Duff and Lindsey Lohan) to the adult action movie clique(Keanu Reaves and Russell Crowe), we have been bombarded with   a perverbial mountain of 'I-can-sing-and-dance' stage starved b-listers, desperate to expand their personal empires by adding musician to their life-experience checklists.<BR>When I was first exposed to 30S2M I was completely unaware of who they were or what they were about. I was simply lucky enough to hear a track ('Echelon' form their debut album) during the closing credits of the Hilary Swank, Armegeddon-rip-off film called 'The Core'. Thanks to movie credits and the Internet I was able to find out the name of the band and find out just who in the hell they were.I find it strange and a little ironic that front man Jared Leto would first gain public noteriety in 1994 because of a television role, playing Jordan Catalano on ABC's short lived dramatic series 'My So-Called Life'...a role in which his character was most well known for being a member in a band.<BR>I, like millions of other teens in the mid-90's, was a hardcore MSCL fan. It makes me feel thankful that my first intense interest in 30S2M came about the way it did, simply because it was unbiased and based on the music, rather than simply based on Letos fame.<BR>This brings me to the album at hand, 'A Beautiful Lie'.<BR>30S2M' debut album was written entirely by Jared Leto, as were all the recorded instrumentals (percussion was performed by the initial 2nd half of the band, his brother Shannon Leto). At the time of its initial release, there was a growing buzz within the media concerning the album. Sadly the brunt of this hype was related to Jareds acting career which left (in many case) the album and its music underestimated or completely overlooked altogether. <BR>It was in fact 30S2M' live gigs which produced the majority of their loyal fanbase (as well as two more band members). As a show of appreciation they have even composed a 30S2M yearbook, including pictures and personal thoughts chronicaling their last US/Canadian tour (available to order on their website). Fans, myself included have patiently been awaiting the bands second offering.<BR>Recorded at the beginning of 2005, 'A Beautiful Lie' takes the band in somewhat of a more uniform and united direction. The debut was a collection of amazing songs with familiar themes, but contained not enough packaged flow and in some cases seemed to have been written with a hit-or-miss methodology. First time outting have seemed similar in the cases of bands such as Coldplay.<BR>With their second album, Jared Leto seems to have lost the beginners jitters. All tracks are amazingly written, Leto having matured vocally and lyrically to his benefit. I had the opportunity to hear 10 of the cd's 12 tracks. Unlike the first (where I often found myself skipping certain tracks) every single song on this disc is addictive at the least. <BR>Highlights from the album include the first radio single, 'Attack', a small slice of what their live show energy must be. The albums title track, 'A Beautiful Lie' currently stands as my favourite song off the disc. Sounding trademark 30S2M yet unlike anything previous Leto now confidently takes the band into random moments of introspection, with several of the cd's tracks exploring darker , more emotional tones thick with eerie melodic experimentation (also heard in 'From Yesterday' and 'Was It A Dream?'). Its an amazing rock record and I strongly recommend you pick it up on its August 30th  release date
0590353403|5.0|Yes, I think it is amazing that this one author and her story re-energized the love of books in children, but I know many more adults that read these books then children.  It has brought a new fantasy to us.  I was never a fan of Lord of the Rings, but I am beginning to see the way people can get so involved in a fictitional world. <br /> <br />Great for the entire family.  Can't wait till my wife and I have a child and I get to introduce Harry Potter into their life.
B000005J08|5.0|I am forever in debt to my good friend Mike Stack for not only getting me into John Zorn's music but for giving me his old copy of NAKED CITY several months ago.  I will re-use something Mike told me that someone else had told him.  \\"If you don't like Naked City, listen for ten more seconds.\\"  This holds much truth, because this music does indeed change every ten seconds.  When Zorn put this group together, his goal was to take a standard five-piece band and push it to the most extreme limits...and then some.  Zorn does not dissapoint! <br /> <br />The band consists of Zorn (alto sax), Bill Frisell (guitar), Wayne Horvitz (keys), Fred Frith (bass), and Joey Baron (drums).  There are also a few 'hardcore' tracks thrown into the middle of the album which also feature Yamatsuka Eye on vocals, if you want to call them vocals!  This was actually a pretty major release as far as avant-garde music goes, especially since it was on a major record label like Elektra.  Unfortunately, at least here in America, the major audience was and still is too immature to appreciate original music like this. <br /> <br />Some highlights on this album are 'Batman' which is a re-arrangement of the Batman themesong.  Zorn was unable to get the rights to the song, so he re-wrote as it should have sounded!  The music is mainly a sax-guitar duo that prepares the listener for the roller-coaster ride that is Naked City.  There are some songs from movies here, most notably 'The James Bond Theme,' 'Latin Quarter,' 'Sicilian Clan,' and 'A Shot in the Dark.'  'Latin Quarter' has one of my favorite Zorn moments where he slices into the middle of the song with his signature 'screeching sax' to start off a solo.   <br /> <br />The hardcore songs are 'different' - most of them are no longer than ten seconds in length and remind me of the thrash/harcore masterpiece 'Speak English or Die' by S.O.D. from the mid-80's.  The music is obnoxiously violent, especially with the addition of Eye on vocals and the extra sax element that as far as I know, is lacking in any other type of hardcore music I've heard.  My favorite track here is 'Hammerhead' which has some violent death metal-style vocals...there's nothing more to say about it, because the track is all of ten seconds.  'Obeah Man' also has some tranquil classical keyboard elements thrown into the middle of heavy metal hysteria. <br /> <br />Zorn also does a fantastic avant-garde/cocaine jazz version of the Ornette Coleman classic, 'Lonely Woman.'  I could do a track-by-track analysis, but it would take up fifty pages, because there is so much change in this music.  I have played Naked City to fans of all music, and at the minimum, most individuals should be able to at least appreciate some of the tracks from movies.  This is a decent place to start for Zorn's music, but it is less challenging than most of his recent material, and therefore, I find it to be an unfair representation of the performer he is today.  I would instead recommend picking up some of his Birthday CDs from his Tzadik label.
0739309013|5.0|I just finished the audio version of The Last Juror today, and it was a great time the entire way.  I don't listen to many audio books, preferring to read at a faster rate than recorded readers--but this book was different.  The story is definately good, but Michael Beck just added something different, I could really believe that he was Willie Traynor, plus he did a good job with the voices of other characters.<br /><br />The story isn't a \\"typical\\" Grisham legal thriller, but it did have elements.  Basically we see life in Clanton, Mississippi from the perspective of Traynor during the years that he is editor of the county paper: 1970-79.  There is a big murder trial at the start of the book that provides an overarcing plot, but the book is about so much more.  We see Traynor interact with the town, turning from J. William Traynor from Syracuse to Willie Traynor of Clanton.  He crosses the tracks to Lowtown to interact with the city's blacks, including the woman who becomes his best friend, the superb cook Callie Ruffin.  As the novel unfolds we get a small town perspective, filtered through Willie's eyes of murder, trials, journalism, the Vietnam War, Desegregation, the changing of small-town life, and the importance of religion in the South.  Furthermore, you don't just get a narrator's perspective on these events--you see what the community thinks, especially when Traynor pens controversial editorials and articles.<br /><br />You aren't just getting a novel when you pick up The Last Juror, you're getting a portrait of a small Mississippi town during the seventies.  You're going to meet many friends and perhaps some old acquaintances if you've read A Time to Kill, set in the late eighties in the same town.  Don't expect one of Grisham's legal thrillers, but if you want an excellent story with a realistic plot then you can't miss this.  I wasn't ever bored, really enjoying the rich descriptive language and everything else.  If you can I suggest trying the unabridged audio with Michael Beck.ridged audio with Michael Beck.

1573225517|5.0|'High Fidelity' the movie is one of my alltime favorites and now so is the book. <br /> <br />The book is different from the movie in that the main character (Rob)lives in London and thus uses some english phrases not often heard in America such as 'bullocks', 'sraightaway', 'on about', etc. In this way the book was more funny to me. <br /> <br />There are also some hilarious scenes that are not in the movie. The book is so much fun to read and I certainly related to Rob and his pessimistic, selfish, cynical views on his world and the people in it. I had to put it down a few times so that I could finish laughing without losing my place. I read the whole thing in two nights... it really is a page-turner. And even though I knew the outcome I still found myself totally wrapped up in the story. <br /> <br />I love this book and the movie. I highly recommend both.

0743424425|5.0|The Shining is an amazing book.  It it about a family that is going through economic, marital, and moral difficulties.  When Jack Torrance, the father of Danny and husband of Wendy, gets a job as a keeper of an old hotel in the secluded mountains of Colorado, they think their problems will be solved with this escape.  Danny, the five year old son, has had a strange knack for predicting things and understanding things over his head.  When they arrive at the hotel, things go bad as they find the hotel to be haunted to the extent that it begins to take hold of each of the characters. <br /> <br />This novel is truly frightening and exciting.  I do have to recommend that whoever reads this book does not do it in a hotel by themselves (a mistake I made and regretted).  This book will keep you intrigued, and I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a suspenseful book!

0767812387|4.0|There's some great dancing in this romantic comedy/drama. Skilled acting, a fairly decent script, enough tension between the characters to keep the film moving along nicely, and plenty of character acters for spice kept me interested. The music was a delight, particularly in the Cuban bar scenes. Wow! This film highlights what dancing is all about: Fun! This is a \\"chick flick\\" that guys will like, too. And some of the couples featured in the dance competition ranked among the best in the world before they retired. Enjoy!
B00005B36H|5.0|You have to applaud a band that can come up with 4 different albums that are great and don't show a slump in them.Many bands change their sound and come off terrible and others keep the same style and become stale.This band has changed in the last 12 years but have given us classic each and every time, how many bands can you say that can do that, not many I bet.This cd is less agressive than Aenima or Undertow but has a darker feel to it.Just put this album on and just lose yourself to a dark, complex world.Every song here is a gem from the Grudge,Schism,Parabola,Tick and Leaches and Lateralus.I can say with certain knowledge you will love this group, especially Maynard James Keenan who has a voice that is uniquely beutiful to spine chilling.I would alsp recommend their other three albums.
B00005JKL8|3.0|If a flick has at least one killer scene, is it worth it?<br /><br />If the answer is affirmative, then saddle up the F-18 and let's whip and drive those nasty Serbian wranglers, pardner: \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" delivers the goods in spades, with a side order of NATO-inspired multilateral lunacy and diplomatic dastardliness.<br /><br />Lots of military hardware---Hueys, F-18 fighter jets, Harriers, Migs, old main Soviet battle tanks, APCs, tac-nukes, shrikes, even sharpened sticks---on display, front and center, Soldier? Check!<br /><br />Aforementioned military hardware blowing sh*it up? Check!<br /><br />Gimlet-eyed growling Gene Hackman (playing Gene Hackman playing crusty U.S. Admiral Leslie \\"Don't you dare call me Leslie\\" Reigart) glowering over consoles and translucent aircraft carrier command center battle maps full of useless blinky lights? Roger that, Captain!<br /><br />Grim-faced Serbian assassins in track suits with scope-kitted hunting rifles? Renegade Serbian filthy McNasties turning a blind eye to their henchmen doing a little extracurricular ethnic cleansing? Check and double-check!<br /><br />And then there are the killer scenes: \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" has more than just one, particularly the brutal dogfight at the outset which duplicitously sets the flick up as if it's going to go down the \\"blow sh*t up good\\" hillbilly rock-and-roll good times, when in fact director John Moore is realling faking y'all out---he's really interested in an icy cold little game of Cat & Mouse.<br /><br />Mouse, in this case, is hotshot U.S. flyboy Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson, who is the Zen Master of the quirky downbeat thing and a strange---but workable---choice as an action hero), who would kill or die for a little action. On Christmas Day 1995 he gets it, flying a solo mission over Bosnia that gets his nifty F-18 cowpied into a field, courtesy of a little vintage Soviet AK-AK and a little righteous indignation.<br /><br />Next thing you know, Lt. Burnett is running for his life across the dead-of-winter Bosnian hellscape, hunting for a way out even as a track-suited Serb assassin hunts for him. Good times!<br /><br />Now: \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" was supposedly based on the reluctant adventures of USAF flier Scott O'Grady, who got shot down in Bosnia. Having gotten back Stateside, O'Grady later observed that he was \\"one scared little Bunny\\", making me wonder whether Air Force issue (along with the service pistol and compass) included a nice set of pink panties and a backup pair of Depends. Yuk. O'Grady also sued 20th Century Fox for slandering his good name: in his court brief, the dude complained he hadn't cussed and never disobeyed orders. Dork.<br /><br />Anyway, let's bring it back to the flick: \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is crisp to behold, and follows Wilson on his little trek through a Balkan hellhole: Wilson does what he has to do like a champ. Hackman does his Hackman thing, biting back on that need to b*tchslap a twerpy NATO counterpart and growling every few minutes about \\"getting his boys back\\". It's all great cornball hokum: the Duke would approve.<br /><br />And at its spit-shined core is a truly killer scene, one that sets it apart from and above the usual whack-a-mole-with-a-tacnuke fare of this sort: Wilson's flyboy has to literally crawl across a drainage ditch of corpses to escape his hunters.<br /><br />It's a deft, brutal scene, beautifully illustrated and gorgeously paced. You'll see. It's done with a minimum of exposition, and zero fanfare, but it gets the brutality and horror of the Balkans across, this horrific little Valley of Death where genocide has been raised to the level of national sport.

I gave it a chance I tried to like it, but it is horrible I had to skip through the songs because they suck so bad. the only good songs were disci inferno & jus a lil bit, and the other radio hits that are already played out on the radio. If u really want it burn it don't waste your money. Lloyd banks and Game have way better albums. I recommend them instead.
B000AA4LAK|3.0|Come on. If you're going to rerelease this amazing album, give us MORE than just 3 bonus tracks. We should have gotten ALL the import single B-sides, including really hard to find tracks like Show You How, Get Trashed, and Who Let You Go. and with so much space on one disc, they should have thrown in some of the remixes of the 2 big hits to make this a really worthy \\"limited edition\\" for the fans. Fans looking for the Mylo mix of \\"Somebody Told Me\\", long out of print on import CD single, should check out the compilation \\"Twisted\\". It's on there in it's full length, along with a ton of other retro sounding alternative bands.
B000020617|5.0|In the realm of current or recent rock, post-Nirvana, it would be hard for this reviewer to grab the banner of a band, any band, hold it aloft, and proclaim \\"THIS is worthy.\\"  I mean, really, who comes to mind?  R.E.M and U2 play out the string with competent, occasionally interesting albums.  Springsteen now shills for a major political party.  Any more, it's not so much a matter of Who's Next? as it is Who's Left?, or perhaps Who Hasn't Dissolved After Three Releases?  It's a grim landscape for those of us who grew up in The Era Of Rock Music...with Rap ascendant and Eminem the modern day equivalent of the Beatles or Stones.  Almost intolerable... <br /> <br />...but for The Foo. <br /> <br />There Is Nothing Left to Lose, the band's third LP, displays about everything one could -- and does -- want in a rock 'n roll album.  A mix of harder and softer, of faster and slower, of varied sounds and textures.  Oh, and riffs.  LOTS of riffs.  Riffs and melodic bits that don't take more than two or three listenings to engrave themselves in the ear and the brain.  And then lastly, a set of songs so strong that at various times each are called personal favorites, the lyrics learned by heart and played over and over again just for the thrill of being able to do it. <br /> <br />Nothing Left is bookended by songs that cover all of the above.  \\"Stacked Actors\\", possibly a homage to Kari Wuhrer, Winona Ryder, or even Miss Courtney herself, begins with a memorable riff, falls into some ersatz lounge jazz, and then goes back hard to the master riff.  \\"M I A,\\" inviting the ghost of Sugar-y drone rock in for some scotch, caps the album with decisive finality, as Grohl intones \\"red, red, laced around your head, cold and rescued.\\"  Is it another girly?  Is it Kurt on the floor?  Is it David himself?  In the end, it doesn't matter, because drummer Taylor Hawkins and bassist Nate Mendel get locked into such a fierce groove that the words settle for runnerup. <br /> <br />In between youwill find the very best of Foo, on top of their games, confidently trying and succeeding at about everything.  \\"Generator\\" pays homage to the envelope follower voice guitar distorter and is the album's most fun track, with \\"Live In Skin\\" maybe its scariest and closest to out of control, as DG wails \\"I'm amounted\\" like a man in the throes of self-loathing.  \\"Aurora\\" is all quiet introspection, save for another killer riff in the chorus courtesy Nate, while \\"Gimme Stitches\\" swaggers with the bravado of vintage Mick/Keith.  Almost lost in all the greatness is the band's sort-of radio hit \\"Learn To Fly\\", a must-have for any classic rock collection. <br /> <br />The musicianship is superb.  Grohl is right (and has a right to be, let's face it) when he calls Taylor Hawkins the best drummer he's ever heard.  Dave himself maintains guitar duties that are short on flash, long on substance, perfectly complimenting the inventiveness of Mendel's bass work.  And Grohl's singing continues to be a revelation, practically making one gasp in awe as to how high the Kurt-Krist-Dave aircraft could have flown with more vocal contributions from the latter.  Beyond Pluto, is maybe where... <br /> <br />In short and in sum, this album is more than just solid, more than just better than the first two Foo releases...even more than just their best album, period.  It is within shouting distance of the very best rock and roll albums ever made.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd heard for three years how great a show \\"Firefly\\" was, but I'd never seen an episode until this week, when I borrowed the DVD set from some friends of mine. It was... phenomenal. And like too many shows on Fox, cancelled far too soon.<br /><br />The show follows the crew of the Serenity, a group of \\"transporters\\" with no scruples about taking a less-than-level cargo if the pay is right and with a bone to pick with the Alliance, the official government. There's a brother and sister on board, both fugitives (she from a top-secret government academy that performed mysterious experiments on her, he for rescuing her), a \\"Shepherd\\" (preacher) with some mysterious ties of his own, an official \\"Companion\\" (do the euphemism yourself), a spunky mechanic, a tough-as-nails second-in-command married to the wisecracking pilot, a dirty-fingernailed grunt and, of course, a captain with a past to live down. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, real personalities and real histories. They're what make the show work.<br /><br />Here, I think, is what hurt it - it couldn't be classified. A lot of people who saw it didn't know what they were really watching - not a far-flung space opera, but a western in the sky. These characters aren't noble Starfleet Officers, they're gunslingers with a definite sense of right and wrong and no qualms about striking out against the \\"wrong\\" as they see it. They carry firearms, wear dirty, dusty clothes and even ride horses when they're planetside. There's more than one episode where you could watch the first five minutes and think it's a show set in the Nevada territories in the 1880s until they finish up whatever job they're on and go back to their spaceship. In short, it was a great show, but one that people couldn't pigeonhole, and while the die-hard fans love that sort of thing, the public at large, sadly, doesn't.<br /><br />The DVD set includes a few nice extras, including a half-hour-long \\"Making of\\" documentary, a few other featurettes, a gag reel and an audition tape. A decent package, considering what they had to work with... but not enough. I'll be there opening weekend for \\"Serenity,\\" and I can't help but hope that somehow this show makes it back on the air.urettes, a gag reel and an audition tape.

B00005JNTX|4.0|The name tells the truth of this movie! This is a real (Ba)Sin City. Lot of violence, blood, almost naked women, immorality, suffer, revenge and sex(not so much what I waited for).  The law of Hammurab rules people on the Sin City. Eye to eye, teeth to teeth. You can't be never sure who is your fried and who is your fried. It's better to watch your back!<br /><br />The Main reason why liked this movie wasn't violence, good stories, music and naked woman. They also suited this movie very well but without great actors and actress, I had ever enjoyed this film so much.<br /><br />Especially, Mickey Rourke(Marv), Bruce Willis(Hartigan) and Elijah Wood (Kevin)<br /><br />Rourke made a great comeback first class. He was very famous in the 80s(for exemple 9½ weeks) but lost his status in the 90s(there were many bad movies). Without his character Marv this movie has get me only 3 stars. Marv is very rude, angry, powerful die-hard, ungly and interesting person. Rourke really plays his role with unbelieveable emotion and  skill.<br /><br />In my mind, Willis has always been a good action actor.  In this movie he has even better survivor than Die Hard films. So many gun shots, hits and even gallows pole won't stop him. Willis has come better actor and can express his feelings better than before.<br /><br />Everyone remembers Elijah Wood on the Lord of the Ring movies.<br /><br />He can't escape it but luckily they were amazing films.<br /><br />Sin City shows that Wood can also play a wicked man role well.<br /><br />Kevin is the most sickest character on this movie(cannibal, soul eater, the collector od dead people's faces). Unfortunately, his role small but remarkable. He don't speak at all but facial expressions, fast movements, sharp nails, dark personality and his animal fried makes his role unique.<br /><br />I liked also woman characters. Devon Aoki(Miho) was taken on Kill Bill movies because she was so deathly and cold minded than anu woman character on these movies.  Jessica Alba ( Nancy Callahan) danced beautifully and looked captivating.<br /><br />Finally, this movie was worth of watching and I am going to see it again same day.Jessica Alba ( Nancy Callahan) danced beautifully and looked captivating.  <br /> <br />Finally, this movie was worth of watching and I am going to see it again same day.
B000002G7E|5.0|White Light/White Heat is one of the great, ugly nihilistic trash heaps functioning as a rock and roll record, rivaling the Stooges' albums in maliciousness and, in the terrifying second half, surpassing them in cacophony. The air conditioning in my car has gone out recently, and so I've been forced to drive around with the windows lowered. I've been blasting this album at full volume out of my open windows for the past two weeks and passer-bys generally tend to look a bit put-upon.<br /><br />The Velvet Underground had already infused an unprecedented social realism in their lyrics and experimented with drones and abrasive textures on their first album, but on White Light/White Heat they pushed these innovations to the extreme. The lyrics evolved from the gritty to the outrageous, and the band created a self-consciously alienating (but occasionally hypnotic and beautiful) racket.<br /><br />The album is comprised of a meager six tracks, the last of which, the infamous \\"Sister Ray,\\" is a monstrous 17 minute long jam, taking up most of Side B, and seemingly designed to weed out the faint of heart. However, its shortness on actual songs merely gives the album a more concentrated impact.<br /><br />The Velvet Underground usually painted a relatively ambivalent picture of drug-use, at least compared to some of their west-coast contemporaries such as the Grateful Dead. In \\"Heroin\\" and \\"I'm Waiting For the Man,\\" both from their first album, the narrator pays at least somewhat of a price for his highs. The exception to this rule is the album-leading title track, a virtual commercial jingle for amphetamines so unqualified and enthusiastic it's almost as shocking as the much more abrasive material that follows. A simple rock and roll ditty, it features a call and response chorus with Lou Reed enthusing about his drug of choice echoed by the band shouting the title of the song.<br /><br />Next comes \\"The Gift,\\" a Reed-penned short story read by John Cale over a gritty, slithery instrumental. It's a mostly successful experiment, despite its length.<br /><br />\\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is, upon first listening, one of the scariest tracks on the album, but further listens reveal it as a darkly beautiful song, even when it begins describing what sounds like a surgical operation gone wrong. Slinking along on a weird John Cale bass line, it has a sultry and menacing power.<br /><br />\\"Here She Comes Now\\" is the lone 'pop' song on the album. Despite its balladic qualities, it's still a little unsettling due to its spectral guitars and vaguely unnerving lyrics. (\\"If she ever comes now, now\\" Physically? Sexually? \\"It looks so good/she's made out of wood\\"? I'm a bit afraid to go there.)<br /><br />None of the preceding tracks can quite prepare the listener for \\"I Heard Her Call My Name.\\" A driving rock song with lyrics hinting at necrophilia, it's set apart by Lou Reed's psychotic guitar-mangling. It sounds like the aural equivalent of a barbed-wire factory exploding, creating some sort of precedent for the Jesus and Mary Chain.<br /><br />The most famous track on the album is probably the crushing final jam, \\"Sister Ray\\". The song is built around a brutal, simple, and memorable riff and features repeated lyrics about murder, transvestitism and drugs. (\\"I'm just searching for my mainline/I couldn't hit it sideways.\\") The first six minutes feature the band at their most violently riveting and effective. Cale foreswears the bass for the organ. The tone of the instrument is so loud and abrasive that at times it almost buries the rest of the band, and his seemingly classically influenced and thunderous soloing is one of the most exciting parts of the track. The band slowly descends into chaos and regroups into a hypnotic drone, Reed and Morrison's guitars slashing wildly, Cale's keyboard meandering around the scale and sometimes punctuating the song with atonal bursts of organ noise. Reportedly the sound engineer only made it through part of the recording before excusing himself.<br /><br />The length of this track is somewhat effective in the context as an album closer, but it is also one of the few things keeping the album from being perfect; if you're not completely on the band's wavelength at this point, it can seem to go on awhile.<br /><br />John Cale would leave due to comepeting egos shortly after this album, taking with him much of the band's experimental edge. The band didn't really suffer for it, they were too good for that. However, they (or almost anyone else) would never record an album this cathartic, visceral or bloody-minded again.part of the recording before excusing himself. <br /> <br />The length of this track is somewhat effective in the context as an album closer, but it is also one of the few things keeping the album from being perfect; if you're not completely on the band's wavelength at this point, it can seem to go on awhile. <br /> <br />John Cale would leave due to comepeting egos shortly after this album, taking with him much of the band's experimental edge.

I love the remixes of \\"Did It Again\\" and \\"Breathe\\" more than the single versions, as well as the remixes of \\"Butterfly\\"-- I guess I'm looking forward to a new remix collection from Kylie. She should also consider adding some B-sides to the next hits package; \\"BPM\\" and \\"Made of Glass\\" are good times (I find myself blasting \\"BPM\\" more than the A side these days).<br /><br />also- can anyone tell me why Kylie didn't release \\"Sweet Music\\" from the album BODY LANGUAGE? that is easily my favorite song of hers, and it has rocked several parties i've been to...
0790734850|5.0|This is an action thriller for the thinking individual. Its one of the best scripts in recent memory. The performances from the love triangle Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger and Guy Pearce is magnetic. The shootout at the end is among the finest ever. Did I mention that Kevin Spacey is also in the film? I don't know why he's on the cover, his part is more of a supporting role. And oh, Kim Basinger is hot!

B00000K19E|5.0|This is what I consider the greatest sci-fi movie of my generation. Visually, it is spectacular to see on the big screen. I remember the first time I saw it, I had to come back to the boxoffice and pay for another ticket, immediately after I exited. I don't remember ever doing that ever and again. I was that stunned by the visuals and the storyline. Before all the imitations arrived, this movie had it all, mind-blowing special effects and an absorbing premise about the future that is both scary and quite probable. I'm not so taken by the sequels though, but that's understandable, this is quite a tough act to follow.

0790729725|5.0|This is one of the best cast ever assembled in hollywood. This is the type of cast that any director dreams of. But I have to point out that Joe Pesci stands above the rest, what he doesn't have in height he more than compensate in performance and screen presence. And then there's Ray Liotta, the first movie where I took notice of him, and Robert De Niro, who had another great film that year (Awakenings). Together with the rest of the cast, and under the meticulous direction of Martin Scorsese, this team is explosive. This is, in my opinion, the best film about organized crime.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt (1992.) Alice in Chains' second album.<br /><br />I've decided to make this review a really short one. Here's the track ratings.<br /><br />1. Them Bones - Classic song, Layne is at his best on this one. 9.5/10<br /><br />2. Dam That River - Probably my favorite song on here, it just makes you wanna headbang to the whole song. 10/10<br /><br />3. Rain When I Die - An epic masterpiece, this is probably the best lyrical track. Great guitar solos. 10/10<br /><br />4. Sickman - Crazy little experimental tune, where it starts fast, turns slow, then goes fast again. Strange, but great. 9/10<br /><br />5. Rooster - The album's centerpiece, Rooster stands as one of Alice in Chains' most popular songs. You should know what this song is about. 10/10<br /><br />6. Junkhead - Another really good song, this one's about how you can become a hypocrite when on drugs. Layne found out the hard way >_> 9/10<br /><br />7. Dirt - One of many melodic rockers on the album, this is another drug-inspired song. Very good. 9/10<br /><br />8. Godsmack - Another one of my favorites, this is one of the most hard rocking songs. Layne's vocals in the verses are very distinct and creepy! 10/10<br /><br />9. Intro (Dream Sequence) - Just an intro to Hate to Feel. N/A<br /><br />10. Hate to Feel - Probably my least favorite here, but it's stil awesome. That's how great this album is with the music! 9/10<br /><br />11. Angry Chair - Another one of the singles, this is probably the moodiest song. More awesome guitar work from Jerry Cantrell! 9/10<br /><br />12. Down in a Hole - AIC's best ballad ever, this was another big hit off the album. Another beautifually written song. 10/10<br /><br />13. Would? - Probably the 2nd most popular song, this was lifted off the Singles movie soundtrack. You all know this one. 10/10<br /><br />Anyways, HIGHLY RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF GRUNGE, HARD ROCK AND METAL!

B0000027RL|1.0|I don't understand why people like this album which is the musical equivalent of watching the OC. First of all Eddie Vedders voice sounds like the son of a bullfrog on crack and toni braxton and ruins any song that has a decent guitar riff. People love to overate this band because they didn't make videos or release singles, but Metallica did that before them and actually made good music. I like grunge but am not one of those people who hates commercial music. I listened to Guns N' Roses Motley Crue and Van Halen in the 80's and early 90's and I still like their older albums. I don't judge an album by its commercial accessability but on how good the music is. And Nirvana and Soundgarden are both better than this s**t. The only good songs on this album are Once and Even Flow so just download those off the internet and forget this album.
B00064VR0W|5.0|As a long time Rod fan, I was extremely impressed with this DVD. I had seen the Great American Songbook Concert last year & wasn't expecting what I saw...but I LOVED IT!! And this DVD takes me back there. The audio & video are superb. Even after his throat surgery, Rod sounds great to me, still the \\"whiskey & crushed glass\\" voice I remember from way back. I'd also purchased the \\"Stay with me Ronnie\\" DVD, which isn't even in the same class as this DVD. Whether you are a fan of \\"old Rockin' Rod\\" or love the old classic tunes, this one's a keeper.
B00000I2PG|5.0|The New Romantic movement gave us many memorable artists, but perhaps none left as stylish and indelible a mark as Sheffield's ABC.  The band first hit the U.K. charts with \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" on their own Neutron label.  Interest in the single lands them a deal with a major label and Trevor Horn (Yes, Art of Noise) agrees to produce their first full length recording.  The end result \\"Lexicon of Love\\" is one of the quintessential New Romantic recordings.  A lush paean to love it summons echoes of Roxy Music, but at the same was very original and unique.  Fronted by vocalist extraordinaire Martin Fry the crack four man group was ably augmented by Horn's studio wizardry.  Equal parts intelligence, flamboyance and swagger Fry commands the show and his lyrics reflect a mixture of ecstasy and agony, treachery and regret, irony and sorrow.  Hearing the original demo of \\"Tears...\\" you can hear the genesis of what would evolve under the benevolent tutelage of Trevor Horn.  Who made who is obvious.<br /><br />The curtain lifts on with the dramatic opener \\"Show Me\\" with Fry soaring to a wonderful falsetto at points amid a lush orchestrated backdrop, the perfect set up for \\"Poison Arrow,\\" perhaps one of their best tracks.  The video of \\"Poison Arrow\\" is perhaps most indelibly etched in people's memories for the band in white ties and Martin cavorting in the infamous gold lam&eacute; suit with an 80s beauty.  On the pulsating track the wonderful Tessa Niles plays vocal foil to Martin who posits \\"I thought you loved me, but it seems you don't care\\" to which Tessa counters \\"I care enough to know I can never love you\\" to a crescendo of drums.  The song is absolute ecstasy and my all-time favorite.  \\"Many Happy Returns\\" starts off with a spoken into and then rapidly picks up tempo and actually points the direction ABC would go with the following release \\"Beauty Stab.\\"  Fry's lyrics and the raw emotionalism of the song is quite striking and it gives yet another chance to show off his astonishing falsetto.  \\"Many Happy Returns\\" glides into the rambunctious \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\" which kicks off with Martin's highest falsetto.  The track crackles with life recalling Haircut 100 (a contemporary New Romantic band) with its lively horns and prominent bass line.  While it bears a passing resemblance to the demo version it's clear that Trevor Horn is the mastermind pumping life and energy into the recording.  Heavy strings and glockenspiel (or is it fairlight?) open \\"Valentines Day\\" with Martin pushing his vocals to their very limits building to a crescendo where Martin implies \\"I'd be a Millionaire; I'd be a Fred Astaire.\\"  There's nowhere to go but the first single that broke ABC in the USA, \\"Look of Love (Part One)\\" which summons up images of the dapper band from their music video.  Vocally this is a showcase for Martin's full range, from low spoken asides and growls up to his falsetto.  Musically its ABCs absolute zenith with full orchestration and once its over its hard to imagine where you could go from such ecstasy, but there's more cards up Martin's sleeve.  \\"Date Stamp\\" is pure Trevor at the intro pointing at things to come for Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Propaganda, and others.  Martin and Tessa heat things up in what is practically a duet against a thumping bass line.  What follows is perhaps one of my favorite track \\"All of My Heart\\" a profoundly felt song on love, loss, and regret reflected in Martin's vulnerable and heartfelt vocals.  For me the recording could and should have ended here as there's no way you could top the sentiments and raw emotionality in \\"All of My Heart.\\"  Recalling not so much \\"Manifesto\\" or \\"Flesh and Blood\\" era Roxy Music as it does \\"Avalon\\" it would be the obvious direction for ABC to continue.  Instead things resume with \\"4 Ever 2 Gether\\" a slight tune with a rather creepy intro and eerie backing track that hints somewhat at where they would go with \\"Beauty Stab.\\"  The rather fitting coda to it all is the closing blast of \\"Look of Love (Part Four).\\"  The original recording had \\"Look of Love (Part Two)\\" which is not included here, but \\"Theme From Mantrap,\\" a track from their spy movie/accompanying full length video (on VHS and Laserdisc).

ABC were on the cutting edge with sumptuous videos and sterling production.

B0000691TJ|5.0|After a string of disappointing albums (End of the Century, Pleasant Dreams and Subterranean Jungle)THE RAMONES decided it was time to come back with a vengeance. The rising hardcore movement and the relative success of thrash giants like METALLICA and ANTHRAX made the scene more bearable for RAMONES unique and revolutionary brand of punk rock. The production is top notch; full, with loud guitars and even louder drums and the song themselves, while mostly up tempo, remained with that classic knack for melody. With this album, THE RAMONES wanted to show us that they were very much aware of all the trends and bands they have helped spawned, most noticeably the hardcore bands, many of them who were beginning to dismiss them as aging punks. Proof are tracks like \\"Danger Zone\\", \\"Too Tough To Die\\", the insane \\"Wart Hog\\" and the decidedly hardcore punk rant of \\"Endless Vacation\\". More melodious numbers were also unbeatable masterpieces, like \\"Chasing The Night\\", \\"Howling At The Moon\\" and \\"Daytime Dilema\\". Any of these more melodic songs could've been a HUGE hit and why this never happened will remain one of hard rocks saddest mysteries.  <br />This was my first RAMONES album and it has a special place in my heart. From this album on, I heard their entire catalog and became a loyal fan. They made me get into punk and consequently, hardcore punk. A truly memorable collection of songs by the TRUE fathers of punk. Be not mistaken! If you consider yourself a punk rocker, you'd be commiting a crime by not owning \\"TOO TOUGH TO DIE\\".
0060934913|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, and had never heard of the author.  If you are offended by four-letter words do not read this book.  If you are offended by frank talk about sexual matters do not read this book.  If you are offended by open discussion of drug use do not read this book.  If you think Emeril Lagasse is the ultimate in chefs do not read this book. <br /> <br />Who should read this book? <br /> <br />This is not a book about how to cook, how to get a job as a chef, how to get the most when ordering in a restuarant, or even what it's really like to work in a professional kitchen, although the book touches on each of this topics.  This is really a book about what it's like to be Anthony Bourdain, who happens to have used cooking to pull himself from an abyss of drug use and hand-to-mouth living to become the executive chef at Les Halles in New York. <br /> <br />Bourdain talks frankly and doesn't give a rat's patoot (not how he would have put it) about who he might offend by doing so.  His web site even gives a recipe but warns against the possibility of hot liquid coming out of a blender because it hurts like a &lt;12-letter word>.  He openly disdains celebrity chefs who work only in a three-walled kitchen in front of the cameras, with their own line of prepared seasonings, preferring to admire those who bust their ass serving hundreds of meals a night, night after night.  He doesn't name names but you know he's thinking of Lagasse. <br /> <br />This book does weed out wannabe chefs.  I have had a few cooking classes at a French-operated cooking school and have daydreamed of cooking as a second career.  This book pretty much cured me of that notion (which is true of many hobbyists in any field who discover that going pro takes all the fun out of it).  The good ones work hard; in Bourdain's case it seems like he is either in the kitchen or thinking about it over 60 hours a week, every week. <br /> <br />Bourdain redeems himself in thefinal chapters when he contrasts his own experiences and leadership style against that of an admired colleague, showing us that despite the history depicted in the foregoing pages you don't have to have a kitchen full of shouting trash-talking, tatooed, sex-starved, fraternal macho men to turn out great food. <br /> <br />The book closes with a vivid description of Bourdain's trip to Tokyo, especially one particular meal.  He is certainly an adventurous eater.  His web site has a video taken during a trip abroad where he eats--stop here if you have a delicate stomach, or are a member of PETA--the heart of a cobra, freshly cut from the serpent and still beating. <br /> <br />A friend of mine owns a restaurant, and I was talking to the chef a couple of weeks ago and mentioned this book.  She has read it three times and says it's fairly much dead on.  She has worked with a few big names in the DC area and the management styles of many well-known chefs would get them called in on the carpet by HR if they behaved that way at a Fortune 500 company. <br /> <br />Do not draw the generalization that every restuarant is like the ones where Bourdain has worked--but I'll bet some are worse.

The only one song that I felt deeply moved was \\"Master of Puppets\\", in which that maestro Kamen (who is also an arranger) added some musical tastes, a mixture of favorite classical composers: Tchaikovsky, Wagner and Stravinsky.  Also \\"The Call of Ktulu\\", \\"No Leaf Clover\\" and \\"Battery\\".  But Metallica would have added few more songs as an encore....should have played \\"Creeping Death\\", \\"Sanitarium\\", \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Fade To Black\\".

I agree with a lot of what has been said about Rachel Weisz and her great performance but not even her grand and game effort could have saved it from its own bad script and its really bad leading man.  <br /> <br />My one star review goes to Rachel Weisz and the slick DVD extras but the movie gets an F from me .  <br />

0140276335|4.0|The beginning of Zadie Smith's debut novel White Teeth is marked by an extraordinary voice: confident, affectionate, satiric, witty. Archibald Jones attempts to kill himself in a car outside a Muslim butchery while pigeons fleeing from the murderous butcher leave streaks of purple excrement across his windshield. Archie's life is spared by the irate butcher because \\". . .dying's no easy trick. And suicide can't be put on a list of Things to Do in between cleaning the grill pan and leveling the sofa leg with a brick.\\" This irreverent, comic beginning launches the novel into Archie's life and into that of his best friend Samad Iqbal. Archie, given a new chance at life, marries the much younger Clara, the daughter of a Jamaican Jehovah Witness mother and a passive, emotionally absent father, while Samad, who is always striving to be a good Muslim, enters into an arranged marriage with Alsana, a woman who was not even born while he fought alongside Archie during World War II. Their children - Irie Jones and the twins Millat and Magrid Iqbal - struggle to find their niche in their overwhelming white British surroundings. If Smith had left her novel at that, at exploring the cultural rifts that divide the families and their cultures, this book would have succeeded admirably; however, the author departs from this course to explore a world that contains a snobbishly intellectual English family, genetic engineering, radical Islam, and the end of the world as predicted by the Jehovah Witnesses. While these separate plots often serve as metaphors for the struggle to assimilate, they simply don't do enough to engage the reader. The result is a tedious, wholly unfunny second half. Characterizations that were done so well in the beginning become lost in the noise of the rest, making it difficult to care about what happens to Smith's inventions. Plot turns begin to feel forced, and reactions, unnatural. Most disappointingly, the witty voice of the narrator fades into the background, and is never as strong as it is in the first hundred pages.<br /><br />The novel owes much to the literary tradition of Victorians such as Dickens and Thackeray, who wrote sweeping novels with comic and/or biting wit. Smith's range is impressive for a first-time novelist, but her skills and literary instincts are not yet honed enough to carry off the sprawl of such a complex concept. Despite this, her descriptions and characterizations are first-rate, even if they get lost among the rest, and her turns of prose can be astonishing.<br /><br />This is one of those rare instances when I find it difficult to rate a book using the five star system. White Teeth is an ambitious, unconventional novel that ultimately tries to be too much. Readers who want to keep up on literary trends and celebrities will want to read this, since there is much to admire in Smith's work.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I'll leave the movie reviews to the other posters... what I want to comment on is the picture and audio quality of this perfect DVD transfer. <br /> <br />One of the advantages of digital cinema (i.e. using HDTV video instead of film) is that when you transfer it to DVD, it looks phenomenal... and this is no exception. However, with the Sin City transfer, they specifically optimized it for wide screen TVs... so instead of \\"zooming in\\" on a letter boxed video, the content is on the disc as full-resolution 16:9 video... and it looks amazing-- nearly indistinguishable from 720p content from a distance. Finally, a DVD that really shines on high-quality HDTV sets. <br /> <br />The sound is equally impressive. <br /> <br />This is literally the best DVD transfer I've ever seen-- it so perfectly matches what was shown in the theatres that it really does this excellent film justice... which is great, because the film truly is visually stunning.

I'll stop there... but I really don't want to...

0553579908|5.0|\\"A Clash of Kings\\" is the second book in George R.R. Martin's remarkable \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. The novel picks up seamlessly where \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" left off. The story deepens and becomes more complex as, (at least), four claimants battle for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and unimaginable darkness and disaster threaten from the North. This riveting, multi-layered epic saga reads, in part, like superb historical fiction, (the novel is based more on history than on legend or myth), and in part like dark fantasy, with a huge cast of vivid, well developed human characters - and a few of the supernatural kind also. As with the first book, there is an Appendix at the back of the novel with the names of all the royal houses, their kings, queens, knights, histories, and mottos.<br /><br />The ten year-long summer of peace has come to an end, and the darkness of a harsh, frigid winter is about to descend on the now splintered Seven Kingdoms. An ominous blood red comet, thought by some to be an omen of evil, by others a portent of good, blazes across the sky. In just a short period, war has ravaged the land. King Robert Baratheon, and Lord Eddard Stark, enforcers of thirteen years of peace, have been murdered - victims of political treachery in the game of thrones. Robb Stark of Winterfell has been proclaimed King in the North and battles, along with his liegemen and their armies, against the Lannisters, while dead King Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly Baratheon, fight each other for crown and throne in the South. The House of Lannister attempts to hold on to their power through young heir apparent, Jeoffry Lannister Baratheon, the child of incest, who rules like a tyrant from King's Landing. His evil, manipulative mother Cersei and his uncle, Tyrion, the dwarf, dominate the sadistic young king and rule through him. Tyrion, called the Imp, tries to check his nephew's arrogance and cruelty and his sister's power plays. At one point he comments that he is all that stands between the family and the population, who despise him, and chaos. Deadly political intrigue is the name of the game at court.<br /><br />King Balon Greyjoy, of the Iron Islands, has marshaled his forces in his own play for power. Meanwhile, major armies are massing against King's Landing from all points on the map, and from various sources, all with their own interests at stake. There is an extraordinary battle scene which occurs during the last 200 hundred pages that is detailed, intense and mind-boggling in scope and creativity. I don't like military/war/battle descriptions, yet I was absolutely riveted to the page. This is really superb writing!<br /><br />Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons and royal heir from the previous dynasty, plans, from a continent away, to travel with her unlikely brood across deserts and wastelands to take back the crown that is rightfully hers.<br /><br />Sansa Stark, Robb's sister, is held captive at King's Landing waiting for an opportunity to escape. Arya, the second Stark sister, is making her way north, toward home, disguised as an orphan boy. She is traveling with a band of miscreants destined for the Night's Watch in the far north. Back at Winterfell, the two youngest Starks, find themselves confronting a friend turned mortal enemy. And Jon Snow, the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark who is serving in the Night's Watch, discovers an invasion of a more heinous nature. Evil, destructive forces, far more deadly than thousands of mounted armed knights and soldiers, are mobilizing to wreck havoc on the land and civilization. Powers as old as the earth itself are preparing to move. Jon is a member of the contingent led by Lord Commander Mormont, (father to the disgraced Ser Jorah), who travel in the menacing frozen wilderness, north of the tower, in search of the lost Benjen Stark, and the King Beyond the Wall.  But the dire danger in the North is ignored or forgotten as feudal lords vie for supremacy and wage waramongst themselves.<br /><br />New characters are introduced in \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" among them Lady Melisandre, a priestess of a god known as the Lord of Light. She has ensorcelled Stannis Baratheon and the powers she wields are terrifying.<br /><br />Martin's prose is fluid and extremely well written. Compelling plots, subplots and counterplots are interwoven throughout as the characters go about their lethal quest for power and wealth. The descriptions are so vivid and three dimensional that this alternate world, one that in many ways resembles Europe during the Middle Ages, is really brought to life on the printed page. The author does not shy away from the brutal realities of civil war. There are appalling abuses of physical and governing power, frightening scenes of battle and strife, where the innocent civilian population is abused and horribly victimized. However, the narrative also includes spellbinding adventure, romance, war, battles, knights and their ladies, quests, infidelity, love, honor, incest and treachery, etc..

B00005MP58|5.0|This deserves 10 stars....or more...a constellation.  This is in my top five favorite movies of all time. I watch it every couple of months because I physically miss the characters, I know that's kind of mental isn't it? The first time I saw it, I was riveted to the screen, no one could talk around me, I think I snapped when someone started eating chips. Pride and Prejudice, or as we call it around our house \\"my movie\\" as in \\"I am going to watch my movie tonight, either watch it with me or go out with your friends\\", is full of comedy, romance, mystery and a touch of action here and there. Although the writers of the screenplay took liberties with Austen's work, it still holds true to the original story I grew up with. Colin Firth is perfectly cast as Darcy, the right amount of snobbery and smolder, Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth can be identified with by all women and she pulls the emotions of that character out of her soul like a pro. The rest of the cast, her sisters, Darcy's friends, everyone has their part in the well oiled machine and without them working as well as they did together, this might have been a different movie. There is a book called \\"The making of Pride and Prejudice\\" by Susie Conklin, its well worth the read on how this movie came to be, how they cast it, the locations, costumes, how they all spent time off, there is a funny story about how the men had to wear hair nets in between takes and how embarrassed they all were about it. ANYWAY You must buy this movie, Although I have yet to buy it on DVD yet because I am waiting for a better transfer, I have seen it and the colors are off, so is the sound. The VHS version will do until they make it better. Sidenote..my husband who is 24 loves this movie, and will admit it even to his closest friends.
B00006LLNV|5.0|\\"Frida,\\" Julie Taymor's superb biopic which portrays the turbulent life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo's, is highlighted by Elliot Goldenthal's extraordinary soundtrack and score. Goldenthal, a student of both Aaron Copland and John Corigliani, and director Taymor's husband, states in the CD's linear notes that when scoring the music he took the approach of \\"melodic intimacy\\" - scoring with melodies or tunes as opposed to motific fragments. The film is highly successful in bringing to life not only Ms. Kahlo's story, but the vivid colors and richly textured culture of Mexico.  In the same mode, Mr. Goldenthal emphasizes Mexico's musical tradition with his score - filled with the rich, evocative sound of song and music indigenous to the region. The composer has explored and displayed the area's folk music, and incorporated it with his own minimalist style and some outstanding songwriting. He has stated, \\"... that it was a difficult task to capture the 'spirit of Mexican music' since it varies so much around different regions.\\" However, his choice to stay true to the simplicity of the country's rhythms and themes is on target. The result is one of the most compelling soundtracks I have heard in many years. I knew from the minute I heard it, in the theater, that I was going to buy the CD. I did so almost immediately and listen to it frequently.<br /><br />Central to Goldenthal's score is a core musical ensemble which consists of several acoustic instruments native to Mexico and Central America, including the standard classical guitar, small Mexican guitar (la vihuela), Mexican bass guitar (guitarron), Mexican harp, marimba, accordion, glass armonica and assorted percussion. The tracks: \\"El Conejo,\\" \\"La Bruja,\\" (performed by Salma Heyek who plays Frida), \\"El Gusto\\" and \\"Carabina 30/30\\" are absolutely fabulous and provide excellent examples of authentic traditional Mexican folk music. Goldenthal adds a small orchestral accompaniment of primary strings to the mix.<br /><br />The importance of song south of the border is pointed out in the linear notes also. In Mexico, song is everywhere - I lived there, I know. One is serenaded for birthdays, anniversaries, engagements, weddings, etc.. There are several outstanding vocal performances here. One brilliant cut, \\"Paloma Negra,\\" prerecorded by Chavela Vargas, (a tremendously popular Costa Rican/Mexican vocalist of the 1960's who sang \\"rancheras\\"), comes to mind. \\"Paloma Negra\\" was recorded about 40 years ago and the artist, now in her 80's, sings a second track, \\"La Llorona,\\" live on screen - so the listener can contrast the diva's voice now and way back then. Vocalist Lila Downs plays a huge role in the success of this CD and the overall soundtrack. The sensual tango \\"Alcoba Azul\\" was written for her by Goldenthal, as were my favorites \\"Benediction and Dream,\\" and \\"Burn it Blue\\" performed by Downs and much lauded Brazilian musician Caetano Veloso. I discovered the marvels of Ms. Downs voice and style  while watching/listening to Frida for the first time, and have been a major fan ever since. Goldenthal integrates both song and score harmoniously. English and Spanish lyrics are featured in the album booklet.<br /><br />The recording quality of the songs is excellent. There are 24 tracks and the play time is 52 minutes. I wish it were longer! Enhanced CD features include musical film excerpts, as well as a video conversation between Goldenthal and star Salma Hayek and text interviews with the composer and director Taymor.<br /><br />This CD is a real winner!<br />JANAtance of song south of the border is pointed out in the linear notes also.

Another annoying attempt to try and capitalize on U2's already massive popularity because of their 80s and 90s.  <br /> <br />'Vertigo' is a childish strategy to not make this one an entirely useless album. \\"Vertigo Rocks!\\", \\"U2's back to Rock, yeah !\\"... that's all, a stupid 3 minutes long iPod commercial with pointless lyrics and repetitive melody, and they sold 800,000 in the US in just one week. Any other band releasing this unforgivable excuse for a radio hit would be crucifed at the spot. Neverthless, since they named this MTV pap as \\"U2\\" it must be \\"the album of the year\\", \\"the best band in the world's today music\\", etc. <br /> <br />They don't even have to try to be versatile, creative nor inspiring anymore, they just sell records because of their name alone.

On the way, they have some interesting dates (that clever screenplay including Lane answering an ad from her own father and Dr. Zhivago-adoring Cusack going out with a cinema-hating bubblehead).<br /><br />Ah, the dogs.  Lane ends up with her brother's adorable Newfie Dog, a loving gentle giant named \\"Mother Theresa.\\"  Both ladies have some fear issues to deal with.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the supporting cast.  Christopher Plummer is pure genius as Lane's widower Irish father with more dates than her.  And Stockard Channing is one of those dates, a preternaturally wise trailer-trash-type who is almost dead of too much Santa Fe style.<br /><br />Yes, a nice romantic little film and better than most in a somewhat tired-out genre.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I WILL SAY I ENJOYED IT. MATT DAMON ACTS BEAUTIFULLY IN THIS MOVIE. STORY IS NOT THAT ORIGINAL. DONT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE THAT ABSOLUTELY HAITED THIS MOVIE. BUT I RESPECT YOUR REVIEW. UM....WHAT IS THERE ELSE TO SAY. MARTIAL ARTS WAS ALL RIGHT IN SOME WAYS. IN A FEW WAYS IT WAS GOOD. <br />WEELLL THAT IS MY REVIEW. PEACE. <br />
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|I give most of the songs on this album 3-4  stars but as a whole I'm going to say 5 stars.  It's not earthshattering or life-changing but it's just so damn nice to listen to, start to finish, suprisingly so.
B0009W5JS2|3.0|I DONT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO GIVE. NOT A GOOD QUALLITY FILM. BUT I TOTALLY DUG THA ACTION AND ATTITUDE IN THIS FILM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE.I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODYS RATING. BUT......LIKE I PRETTY MUCH ENJOYED IT A LITTLE. PLOT IS HORABLE. <br />THIS IS THE MIAMI REVIEWER.PEACE
B00000JPYD|4.0|I've loved this album ever since I bought a used LP of it years ago and would like to share some of my thoughts with you. <br /> <br />If you enjoy late-period Hendrix, you'll probably enjoy this CD. Robin Trower was already an established blues-based guitarist in the late 1960s, but freely admits that he was so bowled over by Jimi Hendrix that he totally revamped his own style to incorporate as many as Jimi's innovations as he could master. In other words, this isn't a ripoff, but the sincerest form of flattery. <br /> <br />If you pay attention while listening to this CD, you'll appreciate that Trower (unlike many who claim to be influenced by Jimi) was more interested in simulating Jimi's textures rather than his licks. \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" and \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" (the CD's biggest hits and my favorite tracks)effectively capture the sort of dreamy, midtempo funk Jimi was doing towards the end of his life. Of course, if you compare Jimi's improvs in \\"Machine Gun\\" or \\"Hear My Train A Comin to Trower's \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" it should be very clear to you that Trower didn't approach Jimi's genius as a player. But that didn't stop Trower from writing some excellent songs in the Hendrix vein. It shouldn't stop you from enjoying his playing. And, if you're a budding guitarist, it should be easier for you to learn Trower's signature licks than Jimi's. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are nice to have, but you probably won't return to them. I do think, however, that you'll find some favorites among the basic tracks of this CD.
0143034901|5.0|I loved this book and will tell anyone I see reading a book to pick this one up for their next adventure!  This one is right up there with The Kite Runner as a favorite!  I enjoyed every page of the Shadow of the Wind and felt totally wrapped up in it each time I sat down with it!  It quickly became a close friend!
B00005UW9T|5.0|This is an amazing animated feature.  The animation was so incredible, great story, interesting villian, some great songs-- awesome action scenes.  I was blown away by the movie.  BUT, I must say that the villian is pretty scary, so I'd highly recommend pre-viewing this film before showing your children because you will be the best judge if they can handle it or not, but believe me, you watching it alone will be worth the price because chances are, with or without your kids, you'll love it.   <br /> <br />Things that stick out... I love the characters, the way they look, and the reluctant love story that blossoms-- great chemistry for animated characters!  The animation is unforgettable.  The three major action sequences were great, especially the train wreck-- wow.   <br /> <br />I don't know when my kids will be old enough to view this (maybe around 8?), but after warning them that the spooky guy is only part of a cartoon, I hope they like this movie.  Oh, and my favorite song is the one the scary guy does-- very fun. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
0553278223|1.0|. . . when he wrote this, I would have thought, nice job Ray.  But he was 30. Writers at this age should not be this naive.  <br /> <br />Admittedly, there are some interesting ideas in this book but it's too much for Bradbury to handle.  He wants to address censorship, the American West and the treatment of the natives, racism, Nuclear War, and general ignorance.  Unfortunately to do this in a short work, he has to populate Mars with idiots who all think in black and white and kill flies with sledge hammers.  There's one dolt I particularly love who decides to start a hot dog stand.  Then one day a martian tries to calmly talk to him and this guy shoots him.  Now, by now he's got to be fully aware of their mind powers and how they could easily kill him. So instead of realizing he's already beaten, he shoots.  Why? Because Bradbury's characters are two-dimensional idiots.  <br /> <br />There's also the part where all of Bradbury's dialogue and depiction of behavior seem to come not so much from observing and experiencing human interaction first hand but by observing pulp fiction in print or at B-Movies. It's like reading the script to a 1930s gangster movie.   <br /> <br />As a keen observer of human behavior, Ray gives us a scene where a party of astronauts land and decide to get drunk and make a lot of noise after the first three parties (maybe 2, I don't care enough to look it up) went missing and are presumed dead.  What?  Aren't these scientists and military people?  Shouldn't they be a little more careful and perhaps not sing songs and get their drink on?   <br /> <br />There's also Bradbury's utter lack of Scientific understanding and imagination.  You know what he predicts?  The answering machine.  Wow, what an amazing future we have to look towards.  I'm not saying he should have accurately predicted the future, but my god, shouldn't he have guessed that we'd advance a bit further than he allows us in his world? People are riding on Steam Boats and mailingletters to Earth!!! (Which costs $5, in case you're wondering.)   <br /> <br />Hey guess what.  According to Ray you can see Earth pretty well from Mars.  No telescope required.   <br /> <br />Oh, did I mention the dialogue is truly awful?  I am now going to open any page and write the first thing I see.  Here we go. \\"Sir it must be, it has to be that rocket travel to Mars began in the years before the first World War!\\" pg 36.  You know, around 1910-1912. There's more, but I just can't read any more of it. <br /> <br />Well there is one more. This one actually rewards the star and not given because I can't go lower.  Here it is: \\". . . she tosses salads neatly, never once pausing for breath\\" page 162.  Look it up.  It's there.   <br /> <br />Oh, finally, for some reason, Bradbury thinks that people would actually leave a peacful place to go fight in a nuclear war.  Sure pal.  You really got your finger on the pulse of the human psyche.  <br /> <br />If you want to read a good book from this era from a guy who can actually write, read Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\".  Good story and readable dialogue.
6305078564|5.0|Don't even consider shelling out one hundred something dollars for this movie, its wonderful yes, but for the price of one you can buy this movie with Emma, Ivanhoe, The scarlet Pimpernel, The new Adventures of Horatio Hornblower, Jane Eyre, Lorna Doone, and Victoria and Albert off the A&E website, Amazon even sells this pack for less then this individual movie. Just search for the A&E Literary Classics - The Romance Collection Megaset. That is if you love the A&E series, and don't mind these DVD's tagging along.
B000002UUX|4.0|\\"Rust in peace\\" is a good album but not even close to \\"So far so good..so what!\\" or \\"Peace Sells but who's buying?\\". Not even close.  The two above mentioned albums are completely out of this world. Rust in peace compared to them sounds like a marching ballad.  Yes, the production is better the sound is much better and  the album is overall more entertaining than the previous two but the music is not.  I'm not trying to diminish the value of 'RIP' , I'm just saying that it's not as good as the wall of guitars and drums, and the technical complexity of the songs make it appear to be.  It was 8 years ago and my brother (who introduced me to Megadeth when I was a kid) said that he sold 'RIP' to a friend of his for more or less 5 bucks. I told him that he was crazy and I still believe he made a wrong choice but the fact is that he was disappointed with it and now I fully understand it. Even 'Countdown to extinction' is better than 'RIP'. <br />  Okay now you want to click the button that this review wasn't helpful to you, but before you do that listen to 'Into the lungs of hell', 'Set the world Afire', 'Mary Jane', 'The Conjuring', 'Black Friday', 'Wake up Dead'........... <br />
0385335482|5.0|Of the seven books I've read so far this summer, this is the BEST of the BUNCH!  Becky Bloomwood is the most hysterical character I have encountered in a VERY long time.  If you like to shop, I mean REALLY like to shop, then you cannot miss this book.  It is definitely more of a \\"woman's read\\" in that respect.  Her shopping obsession finds her in the most outrageous (yet realistic) situations.  Let me just say...Aunt Ermitrude???  Luke Brandon is lucky to have found her also.  Their scene in Harrods shopping for luggage was just too much.  I read this book over the course of 24 hours and then hit the library to get the follow-ups.  If you liked The Devil Wears Prada, or any other humorous books, you'll ADORE this one.  Have Fun!
B00005V331|5.0|Four score and many moons ago the metal scene rocked to groups like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and...Motorhead.  Remember Motorhead?  That three man band that took metal in a new direction.  Then came along \\"Venom.\\"  For those whom knew the name you knew bands like Metallica used to open up for them when they were playing in small clubs.  Venom along with a handful of other small bands and created a small cult following of new bands that wanted to be like them so they \\"copied\\" them.  We all knew who the godfathers of this new genre was and everytime they played all hell broke loose.  This album is a definate keeper for those who appreciate metal.  Youngsters...know your history before you start babbling.  The nucleus of alot of crap thats out there now was directly influenced by Venom. Trix is for kids and Venom isnt...poser.
B00004VVNB|3.0|The premise of this \\"thinking man's\\" tale is intriguing enough, with appropriate and fitting set designs and costuming, a semi-fleshed-out dystopian society (a dystopia being a utopia with hidden insidious elements), and an interesting trio of main characters.  Their motivations are established and followed through nicely, and the nature of their world aided in those motivations.<br /><br />BUT... it wasn't until York and Auggeter enter the ice cave... the exact moment when they put on clothing to warm themselves - is the very moment the movie changes gears.  Motivations become skewed.  Plot points are made slapdash, forgettable, and at times annoying (the Peter Ustinov character in particular).  The conclusions take on a woefully predictable air and the extraordinary setting lowers itself to the mundane and cliched (the ages-old phrase \\"does not compute\\" is used as its climactic signative).  Only the leads' performances and Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score survive the whole ordeal as shining beacons.<br /><br />4 stars for the first half of \\"Logan's Run\\", 1 for the second half = 2.5 stars.
B000006045|5.0|One of the top five records. Ever.  When your stereo joins itself with this album, it will have a hellava time parting with it.  Look no further if you get off on darker groove (sexy downbeats, dirty EastEnd bed talk, kitty cat whispers, supernal melodies).  Definite spliff music.... leaves you wasted and wanting more.    <br /> <br />PS - For virginal listeners, I highly suggest the experience be accompanied by Cabernet, someone you're at least moderately attracted to and plenty of paper towels.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I like this album very much. Although it is emo and I don't really listen to that crap. Musically I like them because they do their thing and don't change. They are not MTV sell outs because their last cd was the same style as this one. But i'm sooooo tired of emo pop punks that listen to MCR because it's a fad or whatever. Ilisten to them because I enjoy the music and the words. Not becuse they wear make up. I challenge you to pick up this CD and not focus on their image. Overall this is a solid effort by MCR.
B00023B1LM|3.0|Just about every Alfred Hitchcock film involved an innocent and everyday man caught up in some plot where he doesn't know what is going on or how to save himself from it.  The Bourne Identity modernises this method.  There's more action, and instead of an everyman in the lead role, we instead have a deadly assassin who doesn't know what he is because he has amnesia as a result of being shot and left for dead.  We follow Jason Bourne as he tries to figure out who and what he is while simultaneously trying to stay alive. <br /> <br />There are a lot of things to like about this film.  The mystery is interesting - we know more about Jason than he does himself, because we see his (former) employers at work, but that only helps keep the plot moving.  I especially like how the action scenes leap out of nowhere - the film turns from exposition or mystery solving to violent, brutish action in seconds.  Finally, the acting and characterisation by the main characters is great - Matt Damon is good as always.  He has a Harrison Ford-like quality of being able to appear frightened and highly competent simultaneously.  He is joined by Franka Potente (little known in America except from \\"Run Lola Run\\") who does a very good job in the thankless role of the innocent girl caught up for the ride. <br /> <br />The film straddles the line between mystery-thriller and action film.  The two parts blend seamlessly.  Unfortunately, there are a number of little things that pull the film's overall enjoyability down.  Most annoying is the plot surrounding the assassination attempts on an ex-dictator.  Firstly, the dictator is portrayed as a scenery-mashing, bug-eyed monster in a performance that is jarringly out of place in a film of subtlety.  Secondly, there is confusion surrounding the second assassination attempt.  We see in the newspaper the next day that it was successful, but we know (because we saw it) that it wasn't.  What's the dictator's game?  Is he faking his death to escape further attempts?  Is there a cut scene later on where we would have seen him assassinated?  The story leaves this dangling, and it's annoying.  Secondly, when Bourne bribes an official, he uses American money.  Since the action takes place in Paris, why doesn't he use Euros?  Because some people in an American audience wouldn't recognise them?  In a movie that prides itself on being smart, this is a glaring error.  Thirdly, there seems to be no rationale for the CIA to be trying to assassinate Bourne (as opposed to capturing him to find out what happened). <br /> <br />While you're watching the film, most would not notice these problems, but upon thinking about it afterwards, you feel like the film was only good and not great.  Another example - if the car chase had taken place in New York instead of Paris, and had Bourne's car been a Lincoln Towncar instead of a Mini, the car chase would not be very interesting.  But it's only on hindsight that these questions arise.  All-in-all, it's a fun and interesting movie, of high quality, as evidenced in the performances of Damon and Potente. <br /> <br />The DVD has a few extras like deleted scenes and a director's commentary.  The sound and video are good (as expected).
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I really can't belive there are people who did't like B.B. <br />It's GREAT, amazing! <br />You know... the costume, I understand, the first one was better... ( of corse it was... dificult to him to move... but the mask was great!) <br /> <br />The others movies... WHAT THE HELL was that? how can someone enjoy that ? the uniform.... GAY! <br /> <br />Come on guys... This Batman is gorgeous! <br /> <br />*Needs more shadown after all...
0385510454|3.0|I'm at a point now where I am starting to believe that John Grisham's time in the spotlight is coming to an end. This latest novel is one to join the ranks of his other mediocre and disappointing works.  The story begins interestingly enough, but fails to continue in that vein.  The main character has no real depth and his love interest, the typical aloof love interest of most John Grishman novels, seems to have entered the picture solely to make sure that there IS a love interest.  The main character's time in Italy is only sporadically interesting.  I certianly could have done without the long dialogues about learning Italian and about what the man in the restaurant is wearing.  To be blunt, there was entirely too much filler.
B0006399FS|5.0|I wrote a review before this about How to dismantle an atomic bomb and I gave it 5 stars. Now I can't expect everyone to see my point of view, but I was stunned that more REAL U2 fans hadn't stepped up to say something about this insane 3 star rating. I checked how many people had given this album a 3 star rating, and I was shocked to find only 120 3 star reviews. How many 5 star reviews were there, you may ask? 400. This is U2's best album. Now I will tell you why. Being a long time U2 fan I was very pleased when I first listened to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Every single song was great, from Vertigo to Yahweh, Sometimes you can't make it on your own to City of Blinding Lights. To the other reviewers who said that this album was disappointing, and that other people agreed with you cannot be more wrong, as this album had the critics raving. The New York times said that HTDAAB was U2's finest work up to date. What other band can stake such a claim after 25 years? U2 has never been in better condition. If you listen to any songs from the album, such as 'City of Blinding Lights' or 'Sometimes you can't make it on your own' and if you are not stunned by the end I suggest you go listen to Green Day or some other band whose songs consist of a guy screaming at the microphone. And their Vertigo tour put all other bands to shame. And to all you 'longtime U2 Fans' which have been disappointed by this album, I just wanted to tell you that anyone who does not like this album is not only not a U2 fan at all, but possesses no musical taste at all.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I remember this series when it was first broadcast in the US.  It was funny then and funny now.  I don't know why they did not produce more of this series or revise it.  It is fast paced and you have to listen carefully or you will miss half the jokes, you also have to be somewhat literate to enjoy Basil's retorts.  Buy this and share it with only your intellegent friends.
0380002930|3.0|Overall I did find this story to be very unique with its substitution of rabbits, instead of people, for characters. I can easily see why people would call it the \\"Odyssey\\" of rabbits. However, I found it to be a bit drawn out and while I very much appreciate a descriptive author, I felt Adams at times was closer to writing something akin to \\"Walden\\" than anything else.<br /><br />It's a bit too adult for children, though it is certainly not above them. I just felt the story could have been a little more succinct. Overall, I give the story 3 1/2 stars as it did have some wonderfully suspenseful moments. Though I found flaws in this novel (which, judging by previous reviews, is not a popular opinion) I do give it an A for originality.
B00000255F|5.0|I find bruce to be a talented musician and am quite fond of quite a bit of his work.  However when he delves into politics he shows his limitations.  \\"democrats are for the working people\\", really, are you sure about that Bruce ?  Touring for John Kerry,  who is a buffoon, shame on you Bruce, shame on you...  Remember where you are and those who are against us.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|I remember Scheherazade being played on our stero when I was a child, which is why I bought it. This arrangement is powerful. I love it.
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi, is beyond a doubt, a great example of why people write books and why people read them. It's an easy read but a very meaningful one. The story is rich and thick with adventure, facts, and fantasy. It questions the core of life and meaning and blends facts with illusion, or does it? I would recommend you have a nice evening to yourself and read this book; I think it might change your life, or, at the least, it will give you something to think about for a long, long time.
B0000E2FLC|2.0|I have been an AC/DC fan for as long as I can remember.  The thing I love about those guys is they are who they are.  They rock their way.  I liked this DVD, but the mix wasn't what I had hoped it would be.  You can hear the lead guitar and the snare drum above almost everything else.  A little more balance would really improve the overall sound quality.  I like the setting, just would have liked to hear all the music.
0553212478|4.0|if your like me then you hate spending a lot of money to read books.  this version of frankenstein is an excellent way to get a good classic for under a dollar.  which is great for college guys like me, the book itself is an excellent read, a little tedious at times but definitly worth it.  it is also fairly short, another plus, so check it out!!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|WHen I first heard Speed of Sound I was very thrilled, as I thought this would be the standard of songs for X & Y. I was very excited about the record, after hearing their past albums, and listening to songs such as 'yellow' and 'Don't panic'. My friend then made me hear Fix you, a song not as good as Speed of sound but still quite a nice peice of music to hear. So when I excitedly purchased the album and listened to it for the first time, I was shocked to be bored out of my mind after a few minutes and wishing I had not spent 10 pounds of my hard earned money on it. The absolute dullness of square one set the standard for all the other songs in the album, so be the time I reached Kingdom Come I was ready to go back to the store and return it, or throw it out the window. I felt tricked by coldplay as they raised my expectations with the first two singles, and along with the hype for the album, somehow made it sell. They will have a problem trying to make any of the other songs into successful singles. Personally, I am very, very disappointed, and I think anyone who thought this album was coldplays best work is living in a world of complete denial, and does not want to admit that coldplay will just have to try harder next time.
B00012BD0S|5.0|Arguably their best album to date, together with 'The Oyssey'. The title song is a true epic with over 20 minutes of total bliss and musical genius. <br /> <br />No fillers on this album, every song is a classic in its own right. Killer cuts along the amazing title track; 'Eyes of Medusa', 'Out of the Ashes', 'Of Sins and Shadows' -Great stuff! <br /> <br /> <br />
1400076943|2.0|I bought this book because (if I recall correctly) it was long-listed for last years ManBooker Prize and also, (this I recall) because it had good reviews here on Amazon. Anyway, I was real disappointed. I quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later.  I found the contrasting aspects of the Father's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality.  Character of aunt, cousin, priest, mom etc etc also grew gratingly \\"perfect.\\"  This  may be excessive, but after a while I felt like I was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel.  The comparisons with God of Small Things are seriously unflattering to Roy's great book.  Comparisons with (the overrated) Memoirs of a Geisha or (also not finished) One Thousand Chestnut Trees would have been more appropriate.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is dope. Rodriguez is the king. Thank you man for this movie.
B0006399FS|5.0|I agree with the reviewer Danny Langford, when he says that HTAAB is U2's bestwork. I think all the songs are magnificent and that anyone that does not have this album should purchase it immediatly, and anyone who has the album but doesn't like it should consider seeing a doctor.
B00001OH7P|5.0|I was first exposed to David Bowie from his greatest hits album, \\"Best Of Bowie\\". Although I enjoyed several tracks on the record, it left me puzzled to who the man behind the glam was. When first listening to \\"The Rise & Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\", the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. Bowie is yet another artist destine for albums, and not greatest hits compilations. Which is the reason that discovering this masterpiece is more worthwhile than just listening to his hits. It's a loosely based concept album the centers around an alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust. The music is very mnemonic, and ominous. It's loud, and very thick in arrangement which includes string sections, keyboards, and stellar guitar work. The record sounds incredibly unique, mostly due to the fantastic theatrical feel to the album. This album epitomized glam upon it's perfect execution.<br /><br />Just about every song here is a classic. Although \\"Starman\\" was the only charted single (peaking at 65), others have received airplay upon it's notable cult classic status, which includes two infectious rockers, \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Suffragette City\\", which run back to back towards the end of the album. Although, I'd have to say my favorite is \\"Lady Stardust\\".<br /><br />This record is simply a stunning change of pace for me, which is why I love it. It just spews with originality. The concept, the lyrics, and the intense sound makes for quite the rewarding listen. If you are a first time purchaser of Bowie's, screw \\"The Best of Bowie\\" and check this out. You'll thank me and everyone who tells you the same later.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|Before this movie, Batman had never really been accurately portrayed on the silver screen. But, now he has...  This IS the definitive Batman film.  Not only is it a great superhero/action film - it is a wonderful film in general.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a reboot for the Batman movie franchise; it is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thankfully, in my opinion).  It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.<br /><br />We \\"begin\\" with a young Bruce Wayne and get a feel for the wonderful, loving childhood he had until his parents were tragically murdered in front of his own eyes by a bum on the streets of Gotham.  We then follow a grown up Bruce all around the world as he learns what it is like to live without a home or money and as he seeks the means to fighting injustice some time after the death of his parents.  We learn why it is that he chooses to become a man dressed like a giant bat and how he acquires the weapons and technology needed to fight the criminals of Gotham and to restore peace to his beloved city.  Even the functionality of every part of the suit from the cape to the ears on the cowl is explained.  That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.<br /><br />Also, we really get to know Bruce Wayne in Begins.  He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl. Bruce Wayne/Batman is clearly the central character in this movie, which the previous live-action films failed to accomplish.<br /><br />The cast in the film is superb.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity.  They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.  Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.  He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be.  Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.  Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.  Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.  And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.  Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.  You are really drawn into this movie for its entirety.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.  Nolan also directed flawlessly.  The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.  Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's.  You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a \\"superhero\\" movie.  It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.  It may be a little bit on the scary side for younger kids - but there is hardly any objectional content in this movie otherwise (which I greatly appreciate).<br /><br />This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.  Check this one out.  It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites thatI have ever seen.
B00005QDW5|5.0|It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that Pink Floyd is one of the greatest rock bands ever. Creating some of the finest albums ever made (including the greatest album ever, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\"), they have carved a pretty impressive niche in rock history. They are also one of the few bands who, in order to have all their best songs, buy all of their albums. However, there are actually some people in the world who only want one Floyd album in their collection.<br /><br />In 2001, those casual fans' prayers were answered with the two cd, 26 track collection \\"Echoes: The Very Best Of Pink Floyd\\". Featuring tracks compiled and sequenced by the band members, this cd does indeed top previous Floyd collections such as \\"A Collection Of Great Dance Songs\\". But how does it add up overall? Here are the positives and the negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-As I said, no compilation will ever truly capture all of Pink Floyd's best. But if you only want one Floyd cd iny our collection (though I can't imagine why one would), than you've come to the right place. \\"Echoes\\" contains all the Floyd classics casual fans will recognize, including \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\", \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1 - 7)\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Us And Them\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\".<br /><br />-All the tracks ound superb with the digital remastering job.<br /><br />-Though it is not in chronological order, the collection flows well.<br /><br />-They included \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\", just about the only listenable thing on \\"The Final Cut\\".<br /><br />-You get some Syd Barret numbers. This is great, since I have been interested in hearing the song \\"Arnold Layne\\", a song about a kleptomaniac transvestite.<br /><br />-The booklet is beautiful<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-\\"Money\\" sounds unnatural without seguing into \\"Us And Them\\".<br /><br />-The band's magnum opuses, \\"Echoes\\" and \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", are both edited. Both were over 20 minutes, but they are cut down to 16 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively.<br /><br />-There are many omissions, but one tops them all: where is \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\"?! That song really should've been here.<br /><br />-While you're on the subject of omissions, where's \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Welcome To The Machine\\", \\"Have A Cigar\\", \\"Pigs On The Wing\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\"... the list goes on.<br /><br />-As well as this collection is sequenced, it should have been done chronologically.<br /><br />So, how does this collection hold up? Surprisingly well. If you're a casual fan, this collection will be perfect. And even if you have all their albums, the sound alone makes \\"Echoes\\" worth owning. An album that belongs in any record collection.they are cut down to 16 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively. <br />-There are many omissions, but one tops them all: where is \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\"?!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Before this movie, Batman had never really been accurately portrayed on the silver screen. But, now he has...  This IS the definitive Batman film.  Not only is it a great superhero/action film - it is a wonderful film in general.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a reboot for the Batman movie franchise; it is in no way linked to the previous 4 movies in any way (and thankfully, in my opinion).  It is an origin story of one of America's most popular characters and it delves into the character of the Dark Knight in ways that have not been seen on the silver screen before.<br /><br />We \\"begin\\" with a young Bruce Wayne and get a feel for the wonderful, loving childhood he had until his parents were tragically murdered in front of his own eyes by a bum on the streets of Gotham.  We then follow a grown up Bruce all around the world as he learns what it is like to live without a home or money and as he seeks the means to fighting injustice some time after the death of his parents.  We learn why it is that he chooses to become a man dressed like a giant bat and how he acquires the weapons and technology needed to fight the criminals of Gotham and to restore peace to his beloved city.  Even the functionality of every part of the suit from the cape to the ears on the cowl is explained.  That's just a glimpse of the attention to detail that this movie takes into allowing us to know this character.<br /><br />Also, we really get to know Bruce Wayne in Begins.  He really has such a great character arc and we really feel for the character long before he ever dons the cape and cowl. Bruce Wayne/Batman is clearly the central character in this movie, which the previous live-action films failed to accomplish.<br /><br />The cast in the film is superb.  Christian Bale does an incredible job as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  As many know, these are really two different parts because Bruce Wayne is really the fake, public persona wheras Batman is when Bruce Wayne shows his true identity.  They finally touch on this, and it is done beautifully.  Also, Gary Oldman is wonderful as Lt. Jim Gordon - and thankfully this character is done in such an awesome fashion.  He is Batman's only friend and a great cop on a terribly corrupt police force in this movie, the way the character was meant to be.  Michael Caine really shines as Alfred and the character is portrayed wonderfully.  Liam Neeson is spectacular (as always) as Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's mentor.  Cillian Murphy is wonderfully twisted and creepy as the Scarecrow without being over the top whatsoever.  And Morgan Freeman's performance is great (as always) in the few memorable scenes he is in.  Katie Holmes also really gives a great performance as Bruce's lifetime friend and Gotham Assistant DA.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes - it is fantastic.  You are really drawn into this movie for its entirety.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer wrote a great script with an incredibly touching and suspensful plot.  Nolan also directed flawlessly.  The action scenes are really incredible as well, and all of the action is necessary to the plot and extremely well edited.<br /><br />One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the realism that is consistent throughout the movie.  Gone are the ridiculous neon lights of Schumacher's movies and the extreme Gothic tone of Burton's.  You really feel that Batman could exist in this Gotham City - even so much that this movie doesn't feel like a \\"superhero\\" movie.  It really goes above and beyond the genre to create a very realistic movie that all audiences can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate at the same time.  It may be a little bit on the scary side for younger kids - but there is hardly any objectional content in this movie otherwise (which I greatly appreciate).<br /><br />This movie is a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and a MUST OWN for anyone who likes having great movies to watch any time.  Check this one out.  It is an extremely fine film, and one of my favorites thatI have ever seen.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie was awesome!!! But is the Deluxe Edition going to be available for Full-Screen????????????????????
B00005JN0T|5.0|This movie is hot. The Graphics were hot and will smith played a beutifull role. i suggest you buy this movie and trust me you will enjoy it as much as i did if you like some action mixed with a little comedy and will smith.
B00006JIA4|4.0|In 1971 one four talented musicians (Freddie Mercury, Brian May, John Deacon, and Roger Taylor) came together and formed one of the greatest rock bands of all time . . . Queen.  Not only was Queen one of the best bands of the 70s they were also one of the most controversial and notorious bands of that time.  With songs such as, Fat Bottomed Girls, Bicycle Race, and Don't Stop Me (along with Freddie's borderline approach in the sexual realm), Queen became one of those bands that moms didn't want their kids to have, and probably for good reason.  However, if a kid was lucky enough to get his hands on a Queen album (and many, many, many were) he was almost assured of playing that record until it could play no more.  So anyway, back to my review of the Platinum Collection.  As one can probably guess by now, I absolutely love Queen, however that does not mean that I absolutely love this collection.  The first cd of this collection is absolutely amazing; there's not a weak selection on the whole thing.  Starting out with Bohemian Rhapsody, a true masterpiece, it concludes with one of the bands most famous hits, We Are The Champions.  Sandwiched in-between these two songs are all of Queens' biggest and best hits (Another One Bites the Dust, Killer Queen, Fat Bottomed Girls, Bicycle Race, My Best Friend, We Will Rock You . . . they're all here).  The collection than moves into the second cd, Greatest Hits Volume II, which is a very, very strong compilation of most of Queen's lesser chart hits (such as, One Vision, which charted at #61),   big chart hits from the bands later years (such as Radio Ga Ga, which charted at #16 in 1984 and The Show Must Go On, which charted at #16 in the U.K. in 1991), and several fan favorites (such as Innuendo, Breakthru, and I Want it All).  While not as good as the first cd in this set, Greatest Hits Volume II will makes its way into your car's cd player quite often.  I wish my review could be over now, having covered two excellent cds, but no there is one more \\"bonus\\" cd that this collection offers.  The bonus cd, unlike Greatest Hits Volumes I and II, will not get frequent play time in your car stereo system, or any other stereo system for that matter.  When I first listened to this cd I thought to myself why even bother and I haven't listened to it since.  The third cd in the set (Greatest Hits Volume III) is basically a waste of time and money.  Most of the songs on it, are artists (i.e. Elton John, George Michael, and more) trying to cover classic Queen hits.  Seriously, only Freddie Mercury (Queen's lead singer) can sing Queen songs the way they are meant to be sung, and once he passed away Queen really should have just stopped altogether (It's like the Doors without Jim Morrison).  Anyway, this cd is a pointless addition to the collection.  If I were you, which I am not, I would go out and buy Queen's Greatest Hits Volumes I and II, two disc compilation, forget Greatest Hits Volume III, its not worth the extra $5-10.  In conclusion, Queen was a great band, and Greatest Hits Volumes I and II captures most of their best work - they are perfect cds for a person just starting to listen to Queen or an avid fan who is looking to bolster his collection.  Believe me, once you buy Greatest Hits Volume I, you better put it on your computer hard-drive right away, because you are going to play that thing until it can't play anymore.   <br /> <br />P.S.  The Platinum Connection contains an excellent mini-booklet, that gives a brief story behind the songs (including chart positions) and provides excellent photos of Queen covers and of the band itself.    <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is an excellant CD.  The variety of songs is wonderful and the quality of the voices were very good.  I would like to see more performed by this particular group of women.
1932100385|5.0|I have been on \\"health food\\" for 30 years, and have been vegan for the last 6 years.  I have studied naturopathy and read many books on natural diets.  This book is, by far, the best, because actual studies are the basis of the whole food, plant-based diet recommended by Dr. Campbell.  All of his recommendations are based on his 40-year career of nutrition studies, most financed by the National Institute of Health.  There is no speculation here.
B00000K3CM|2.0|ok, home alone sucks. Why do they keep on making this crap?! the only movie that is actually good is Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House. But i dont watch it because everyone thinks it <br />HA4's stupid too. So dont buy this. Its so stupid with all of the stupid storylines, script, action, and crime. 20th Century Fox, please stop making Home Alone movies and make more PG13/R movies every second while you're at it!-- Actually, it's all a lie. This movie does not really suck.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was introduced to Firefly via a friend.  He said he saw it on DVD, loved it to pieces, and thought I would enjoy it.  Neither one of us watch TV much and both of us own a Tivo... how ironic.  Given my friend's positive review, I decided to give it a viewing myself by renting the DVDs. <br /> <br />I'm a sci-fi fan, but I haven't been able to get into the  countless Stargate and Bablyon 5 clones... Firefly was different.  A western set in the future.  A group of people who are struggling to make it in the \\"verse\\", much like many of us do in 2005.  Each one having a unique perspective on what it is that they are trying to accomplish with their lives and within any given day.  Every character on the show is likeable and layered with degrees of complexity that you don't see in TV anymore. <br /> <br />I really came to appreciate the Captain and his dedication to his crew.  Unlike many shows in space, there isn't a structured hierarchy with the characters.  Sure, the Captain is well, the captain of the ship, but people disagree and act like individuals.   <br /> <br />I watched each episode on the DVD wishing the show would never end.  Alas, I got to the last DVD and then the final episode and I was sad... so I watched all the special features and came to Amazon.com to buy the box set.  That is a testament to how great this show is.  I will spend money on it.  Do you hear that Fox!?!? <br /> <br />I was one of the many people who didn't see Firefly when it was on television.  Perhaps the genius executives at Fox didn't know how to market the show.  I love this show and I will go see the movie... which will be the first time in a long time that I go to a movie theater...
B00079FUI6|5.0|The characters are a blast and each you get to know so well.  Eventually, you'll look at your girlfriends and think, \\"oh, that was such a Bree thing to say\\"... they are so much fun to watch and route for each week.  There's a lot of humor and the underlying plot that carries through always keep you in suspense wondering what the real mystery and the real truths are.  Not like a soap, but more like a suspenseful, comedy, drama that you'll be glad you own.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I'd seen this band's name listed in the club show directory a few times in the past, but beyond that, I knew nothing about them.  When I heard \\"Bat Country\\" on the radio a week ago, I knew I had to buy this CD.   <br /> <br />For starters, the fact that this band actually has a lead guitarist who knows how to play the guitar sets them head and shoulders above most other so-called \\"nu-metal\\" bands.  With finger-tapping, hammer-ons, harmonics; and all that other good stuff, Avenged Sevenfold have more in common with bands like Shadows Fall, Slayer, and Children of Bodom, and classic German metallers Helloween, then with modern crap-metal bands like Papa Roach and Slipknot. <br /> <br />\\"The Beast and the Harlot\\" is a great opening track that really sets the pace for the rest of the album.  It shreds, and again, the lead guitar is outstanding(the lead guitarist is named \\"Synyster Gates\\").  There are some nice acoustic flourishes on this CD, and the previously mentioned \\"Bat Country\\" is a real standout(an ode to drug addiction, and an obvious reference to \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\").  There's also \\"Betrayed\\"; a rather powerful tribute to late Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrel.   <br /> <br />Why did this album only get 4 stars? For one, despite the above average musicianship, there's not really a ton of variety in terms of the pacing and intensity of the tracks.  This band doesn't do acoustic or subtle very well, so when those tracks appear, they don't provide a truly compelling contrast.  That's something that can change as they continue to develop as a band.  Also, the singer, while strong in his lower range, sounds a bit too nasally in his higher range; almost like a wannabe Mike Patton on Faith No More's \\"The Real Thing\\".  Again, he's good in his lower range; just for future reference, watch the nasally thing!  <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a good CD, and I recommend it.  Much better than most of the so-called \\"nu-metal\\" trash out there now.  This band has a tonof potential, and has given me hope that there are young musicians in America who still know how to play the guitar.
B00003CX9E|1.0|This film chosen as AFIs best film ever????  What were they thinking??  Ignoring the cynical and sarcastic reviews here parodying the negative reviews, I think the opinions for a reviewer are that particular reviewers opinion ALONE.  I respect those who have great appreciation for \\"ART FILMS\\" which Citizen Kane certainly is.  I would never put down another reviewer just to cruelly make fun of them (insulting their intelligence, making them seem like they are morons just because they happen to find the film boring).  This film is not everyone's cup of tea.  If it is yours, then wonderful!!  If it is not, great.  I'm in the category of people who appreciate great literary work (My favorite films are 1935's \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" by the great Charles Dickens and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" by John Steinbeck made in 1940.  I have no use for modern movies of today.  I prefer the Black and White Classics.  But I am mystified by the AFI's selection of Citizen Kane as the best film ever.  An excellent movie will appeal universally.....like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", whose inspiring message and timeless values we are in need of today.  Citizen Kane is not universally appealing.  I will not apologize for the fact that it is indeed a real \\"sleeper\\" and I mean that literally......it puts me to sleep within the first 10 minutes of viewing.
0552149519|2.0|I only started this book because of the hype, so I guess I did learn something. I found it almost impossible to put down as I continued to search out errors. Not as good as any of his other books.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you are a fan of the series, then you probably loved all the extra-special episodes, including the musical episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\". All the catchy song-and-dance routines with clever lyrics and beautiful vocals are right here on one CD for you to enjoy. Amber Benson, Anthony Steward Head, and Emma Caufield have surprisingly beautiful singing voices and really shine on this album. The ensemble numbers and solos are also plenty of fun. The songs are so catchy that I find myself listening this CD over and over; even the silly tracks like \\"The Mustard\\" and \\"The Parking Ticket\\". If you're a big enough fan of the series, then you'll probably appreciate the additional music included on this album.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I parody the title of their great Country/Blues musical as the gloss seems to have tarnished on the most recent undertakings of these entertaining masters of popular cinema. All their work is worth watching. But it's the 'Big Lubowski' that we regularly revisit for a full-bellied laugh. I mean, Jeff Bridge's Dude, well, 'it's just good to know he's out there,' as the film's cowboy narrator quips laconically at the bar. The characters are brilliantly conceived cliches: the middle-aged detritus of the 60s. 'Metallica' roadie(Bridges) and Vietnam vet(Goodman) contend with big money racketeers of the 90s. There's the stony performance artist(Moore) who wants a baby donor without the encumbrance of a husband, a porn star nympho married to the geriatric cripple Lubowski, whose suspect alliance is the cause of a kidnapping scam. It's all comic-strip speed and synchronised to the cannonading commotion of the bowling alley. Oh the cameos! The snake-hipped Jesus bowler strutting at the head of the lane(Turturro), and the whippet-faced loser, Donny(Busconi). The Dude's flashbacks induced by weed, kelhua, knockout beltings or acid flashbacks, are brilliant. The story is preposterous, but we, like the Dude, just roll with the punches. Goodman's dementia is one of his finest screen acts. His final folly, first piling the memory of Donny onto the corpse of his Vietnam experience, then allowing the Pacific updraft to dowse the Dude in their deceased mate's ashes, is a hoot. Goodman stands pathetically knock-kneed, trying to make up to the Dude with a cuddle that he knows is appropriate but is too repressed to enjoin. Damn it. Let's go bowling!

B0009I7NNA|5.0|If you've read any of my other reviews, you know that I commend CDs that provide a lot of listening time that doesn't get old. This CD does just that. Every track is something you will love, and every track is something that you won't get bored with. These guys can ROCK and their unique blend of very hard rock with singing instead of yelling and screaming sounds like heaven. This CD is worth every penny, if you haven't purchased it yet... there's something wrong with you. <br /> <br />I give this album 5 stars because it is top-knotch.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|This album has absolutely no lyrical content to it. Most of their songs have very good lyrics but this cd lacks any at all. <br /> <br />Also missing is one of the things I like most about SOAD. Besides the hardcore metal they also make some amazing slower songs. eg. Spiders, Atwa, Roulette. Mesmerize does not have a song close to any of those on this album.  <br /> <br />Hopefully Hypnotize is actually worth the money.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Before you purchase, know that this is a very unique-sounding album. Despite that fact, it is amazing. BYOB had everyone addicted but if you haven't purchased this album yet I'm sure that song isn't the reason why. So overplayed. Question, Cigaro, This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on this Song, Sad Statue... just a few names of songs that will blow you away.  <br /> <br />5 stars. Well Deserved.
068987474X|1.0|The \\"review\\" by Karen Hudson probably is better advise than anything he wrote in the book.  He states the blatantly obvious and he has clearly hung out with a less than stellar croud of men.  If it isn't terribly obvious that's because that particular advise is wrong 50% of the time.  The best thing he said was don't chase, which if you are chasing a guy, he's running for a reason so forget him.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Boy, did I start salivating when I heard about this Extended Edition coming out! I know it would be hoping against hope to cross my fingers, toes and everything else for a version that will also include the deleted scenes (between Linda Hunt and Francesca Annis, Everett McGill with Judd Omen, who ended up on the cutting room floor entirely,) as well as commentary from the actors who are still around. But better that than hoping for any involvement from the Maestro himself, (who must still be nursing a lot of deep wounds from the bashing he got from Universal during the making of it.)<br /><br />Well, just the fact that it includes BOTH versions is worth purchasing this collection at (almost) any price. A near-pristine transfer would be such a gift to fans of this movie all over the world, as well as die-hard Lynch fans in general. I don't know WHEN this comes out, but count me in!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm a big fan of punk rawk. I love old school punk albums like The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, The Buzzcocks, The Clash, etc. I have albums from the punk revivalists like The Offspring, NoFX, Rancid, MxPx, etc. I also like a few of the new school punk pop artists like blink-182, Bowling for Soup, Relient K, etc. What I'm finding really annoying at the moment are the so called punk pop acts like Simple Plan that is just a bunch of whining about their poor sad lives when they're making crap loads of money.<br /><br />What I think is funny, is that this new Green Day album is not considered to be punk by the punk rock community. Why do I think this is funny? At one point punk was about rebellion, going against the grain, but staying true to your own believes and ideals, sticking it to the man so to speak. Nowadays punks come in precut molds, tailor made to be what every wants them to be. The sound is straight from the manufacturer, instead of blowing away the mold.<br /><br />With Green Day's new album American Idiot, they've done what punk hasn't really done in years. With their style, they're against against the grain, while perfecting the idea of punk pop revivalism. They go against the grain by resurrecting an art form perfected by The Who with Tommy called the rock opera, and further perfect it into one of the greatest albums of our generation. And with that album they stick it to the man. Isn't that what punk is all about.<br /><br />While those elements are all great to have, the music still has to be there if it's to be a great album, and it's more than present. This represents why Green Day is the greatest and biggest of the punk revivalist bands. They meld together all of their influences to create the greatest album of their career, in my opinion one that even surpasses Dookie in greatness. Not only is it the greatest album for them, it is also the greatest album of this generation. Standout tracks for me are Jesus of Suburbia and Holiday.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves punk, or just loves great music, but doesn't care if their punk comes from the box.highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves punk, or just loves great music, but doesn't care if their punk comes from the box.
B0000648WZ|4.0|This flick has all the makings of a guilty pleasure: absolutely reprehensible acting, miserable dielogue, good special effects, heaps of violence and gore, stupid hot chics. I'm not saying that Denise Richards is an idiot (because I don't know her), just that she seems like an idiot. Remeber when she played a nuclear physicist in that James Bond movie I can't remember? That was fun. Now Casper Van Dien is an intersting fellow. I tend to follow the Casper Van Dien rule, which goes something like this: If Casper Van Dien is in it, don't watch it. In this movie, he's particularly bad, but you can hardly tell because everyone in this movie is awful. <br /> <br />It's saving grace is that it was written by Robert Heinlein. All the parts that are interesting, like the concept of citizenship, and the structure of society were created by the original author. Also, from the first time I saw this movie I always thoght it had this 50's era feel to it. Mostly in the deportment of the people. Well, that's because the book came out back in '59. <br /> <br />I almost walked out of this movie when I saw it in the theater, and for a long time I couldn't stand it. I guess I expected something different, something less ridiculous. The next time I saw it I either took it, or myself, less serious. It still sucked, but somehow it was also a lot more fun, kinda like Denise. It may be stupid, but it looks good. If that's been enough to keep our species going, well, it probably works for a movie to. Were this movie a millimeter less violent and bloody, I'd probably still hate it, but it is what it is, and I love it.

Go, Go, Go, (Down the Line)  <br />13. Mean Woman Blues  <br />14. (All I Can Do is) Dream You  <br />15. Cladette <br />16. It's Over <br />17. Oh, Pretty Woman <br /> <br />Those are all the songs that Roy Orbison perfoms in the concert, the background you have k.d. lang, Bruce Springteen, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, and a band behind him, that includes Elvis Presley's own guitarest James Burton, Elvis' drummer Ron (or then Ronny) Tut. That would be the big through away, Glen D. Harddin on Piano, and yes that is Jerry Scheff playing the bass. ELvis Costello plays the guitar, along with the harimanca on 2 songs, and the organ on tracks 12-14, he is back on guitar on song #14. And yes that he him playing the harmoinca along with Roy Orbison, even through it might soundv terrbible on Candy Man. How much more can you say about this recording, Roy Orbison influnded not only his fans, but others singers as well, and a few of them pays tribute to him in the show, the girls are seen side by side, along with the guys, the guys are on 3 sets of mircophone, and aren't heard of a lot in this show, but they give it their all on Pretty Woman, J.D. Souther even joins the chours in the middle of Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes on Blue Bayou, most of the singers even share thierstories of working with him on the show, and more during the end credits, on the program, that extends this to 64 minutes, the concert runs 61 minutes and 40 seconds, along with serevel long guitar breaks during some of the songs as Ooby Dooby, and Go, Go,Go, (Down the Line). Otherwide, this is a very enjoyable concert, and you may not even know just how popular he was with other singers until you either see or hear or about this show.
0142800821|3.0|THIS WAS MADE UP FROM AN ENGLISH RADIO SERIES THAT HAD SOME INTERESTING HISTORY AND MUCH ANALYSES OF GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION. <br />LIKE MOVIE TRAILERS THE FUNNIEST LINE IS THE TITLE. <br />IT WAS INTERESTING AND FAINTLY AMUSING BUT MY TASTE IS LESS SUBTLE AND SUBDUED.
B0009W5JS2|3.0|Everyone is way way way too hard on this movie. Sure there should've been no movie without Vin Diesel. But brace yourselves, I think this is a better movie than the last one. In that you had Vin sledding on snow from bad guys while annoying loud heavy metal played. That at least looked real though, most the action in here looks supper fake. Still they're still enjoyable and this isn't a bad movie to watch with some drunk buddies lol. Which might be why I enjoyed it haha.<br /><br />  Soon after getting news that Xander (Vin Diesel) is dead they go out to find a new XXX. Then Samual L. Jackson of course says I know just the guy and he's has to be meaner, tougher and blah blah more than the last. Not sure if Ice Cube is all those things over Vin Diesel. Xzibit  who's in better shape than Cube looks better for the part. Instead he plays a sidekick to him basically.<br /><br />  When Cube is strugging to fight William Dafoe, I was hoping Cube would die and Xzibit would just come in and win with one punch haha. But with all joking aside, Cube doesn't do that bad filling Diesel's shoes. Saying that he's the better XXX is a joke though. Scott Speedman (Dark Blue) also gives one of his better performances. He plays an agent who's after Cube but of course believes him after awhile and teams up with him. I'm not giving anything away, most the trailers make it clear that's what happens anyway.<br /><br />  William Dafoe surprisingly does nothing for the movie though. He's noir bad or good in his role, he's...just there basically. He was much better as the Green Goblin in Spiderman though. He had great villain written all over him in that. This is probably his weakest time as a villian ever. Usually he proves to be dependable when you want a good villian. Plus Samual L. Jackson I think is more entertaining in the one. He sharpened up the role for himself this time around. When he tells Cube \\"you should've killed the bitch, I told you, you should've killed the bitch!\\" . I couldn't help laughing. In the first he pretty much was just a guy in a suit and was as flat as him playing a Jedi. Here at least he brings out some of his Pulp Fiction character. When the film ends it ends with him  saying, lets go meet the new XXX. And I say \\"I wonder if it's Napoleon Dynamite\\".  Then they can claim he's meaner and tougher than the last two.'t help laughing. In the first he pretty much was just a guy in a suit and was as flat as him playing a Jedi.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|Based on the original play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols delivers an interesting adaptation which only flaw seems to be that play like feeling in some parts of the movie.  `Closer' tells the story of four people whose lives get connected to one another's in the most dysfunctional ways.<br /><br />I had never seen a movie about relationships that portrayed so realistically all the ups and downs. The movie opens with Dan and Alice meeting and falling in love in a quite traditional and romantic way, with the beautiful `Blower's daughter' in the background. Going from there we get to see a story of betrayal and a well earned lack of trust in the relationships of these four characters. I won't give away the plot like many other reviewers already did, but these characters are lovable even when they have no respect for anything, even when they break the hearts of the ones that love them.<br /><br />The approach to relationships in this story is crude and erotic, there are situations in which the dialogues will just blow you away, and these moments are mostly because of the well chosen cast and a very good direction. Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and even Julia Roberts deliver some  moments that are sometimes hard to digest and/or believe, the discussions and the openness of the things they say one another are great contributions to the story.<br /><br />Like said before, the only apparent flaw this movie has is the use of the timeframes, one moment you are watching a regular sequence and in the next cut a year has passed already, with no explanation at all, you will have to guess based on the situations and the subtle changes perceived (forget about titles saying `One year later', there's nothing of that here) This situation can make it difficult to some people to watch and understand completely the film. Other than that, the direction, photography and performance of the cast are breathtaking.<br /><br />The movie has no extras at all (I do not consider previews for other films as extras, hope you agree) besides Damien Rice's music video for `The Blower's daughter', which will be enough for fans of the film. The sound comes in a decent Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and is presented in tis original widescreen format.reviews for other films as extras, hope you agree) besides Damien Rice's music video for `The Blower's daughter', which will be enough for fans of the film.

B0002NRRAG|4.0|Whoever was at the mixing board when this set was being recorded or responsible for the mastering process afterward must've literally blown their eardrums out. I've NEVER heard a CD this badly compressed before in all my years as a music-buying customer (and if any of you have a quality high-end system, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about here). You know, largely acoustic-based albums are not supposed to be jacked up to the max like so many of these mainstream pop/rock/hip-hop releases. It's ridiculous, plus it all but nearly ruined an AWESOME comeback performance from Peyroux (who did well to take time off after dropping her critically-acclaimed debut 'Dreamland' 8 years prior; she's in very fine form here).<br /><br />HOPEFULLY, somebody will spread word to Peyroux's record label and get this rather annoying mixing/mastering problem corrected once and for all. For once, I just want to hear the music the way it was meant to be heard: with the loud parts loud and the quiet parts Q-U-I-E-T!!!!!!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|You can't sing.  Your voice is more annoying than Gilbert Gottfried and Fran Drescher's laugh combined.  You are not fooling anyone with your \\"punk\\" image (except maybe 11 year old girls).  You make Munky (from Korn) look like Tony Macalpine or Steve Vai with your ability for playing the guitar.  You are as about hardcore as Lindsay Lohan.  I could go on but I don't feel like it.  If you want to listen to good female singers, listen to Sarah Mclachlan, Tori Amos.  If you want to listen to good punk, listen to Bad Religion, Strung Out.  Anything but Avril Lavigne.  And while I'm at it, anything but Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and Hillary Duff.
B00005JNSK|3.0|It's been a long long LONG time since I've read the book, so naturally, my comparisons here are between the first movie and this newer version.    I think I would give the original movie a B+ and this one a B. Like they say, if something ain't broke, don't fix it. Here's what's broken in the new version:    1.) No subplot involving Mr. Slugworth trying to get an everlasting gobstopper out of the kids. This provided an epiphany at the end of the original that is sadly missed here. That subplot was great because it showed us that Charlie was indeed a good person, by the fact that he gave the gobstopper to Mr. Wonka even after being told he \\"gets nothing!\\".  This subplot wasn't in the book, so it's easy to forgive Burton for deviating here.    2.) No fizzy lifting drink tangent for Charlie and his grandfather, which furthered the subplot above (again, this wasn't in the book either).    3.) Introduction to Charlie, his family and his search for a golden ticket does seem to go on forever....Next thing we know, Augustus is getting sucked into the chocolate spaceship tube. The whole factory tour seems a bit rushed.    4.) First oompa loompa song rocks, and you start to think that this is the point where the movie will start to crackle. However, subsequent oompa loompa songs aren't as good as the first and maybe two out of the four are catchy and/or funny. The casting of Deep Roy (whoever he is) as the oompa loompas, however, is definitely a positive.    5.) Varuca's demise: Here it involved squirrels and \\"bad nuts\\" as opposed to golden geese and varuca being a \\"bad egg\\". 1971 idea was much funnier (not to mention the original song, \\"I want today, I want tomorrow\\"), but the book apparently had squirrels--I am guessing the 1971 movie couldn't pull this off as far as the F/X department goes).    6.) Johnny Depp looks WAY too young to be an aging chocolate factory owner seeking an \\"heir\\" to his chocolate throne.  He also reminds us WAY too much of a certain King of Pop.    7.) Ending is a major let down (spoiler alert!), the way Charlie is unceremoniouly the winner just because he is the last of the four standing. Then the movie goes off on a tangent where Charlie and Willie to visit Willie's dad to reconcile old issues. That whole ending won't interest kids, and frankly as an adult, I didn't care either.    8.) Other differences that don't matter much: Violet is escorted by her mother in this film (her father was in the first movie), Mike Teavee is escorted by his father here (his frantic mother was in the first movie).    All that being said, it is still a fun trip, with probably more laughs than the original.  Worth the ticket, and would probably be fun to see at the IMAX theaters it has been showing in.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|In 2004, Stephen Chow directed, co-produced, co-wrote and starred in the imaginative kung fu film named \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\".  The fictional story is set in China probably before the Japanese invasion in the city of Shanghai.  A ruthless black-suited gang, known as the Axe Gang, controls the police and spreads terror where ever it is in control.  It also thrives financially on casinos. However, the Axe Gang (and other less influential gangs) tend to ignore the poorest areas, including a little-known set of dilapidated apartments and shops known as Pig Sty Town.  Its landlord (Wah Yuen) and extremely loud landlady (Qiu Yuen) often fight with each other and make frequent calls and demands upon their poor renters.  One day, two men claiming to be part of the Axe Gang pass through Pig Sty Town.  The two men, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) try to bully themselves with the poor Pig Sty Town residents, but are quickly thwarted by the noisy landlady.  In at attempt to call for help, Sing shoots a firework beyond the walls of Pig Sty Town and it happens to land upon the head of a real Axe Gang boss, who is traveling with a dozen or more black-suited gang members and immediately demand to know who attacked them.  Amazingly, three of Pig Sty Town's poor residents attack the gang with heroic kung fu fighting.  Angered, The Axe Gang leader, Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), hires two kung fu masters to attack Pig Sty Town.  He also makes Sing an offer: if he can prove himself by killing someone, he can join the Axe Gang; but Sing and his sidekick can't quite be as evil as they would like, especially when they encounter a mute young woman (Si Lu Ren?) and her ice cream stand.  Using an unusual stringed instrument filled with weapons, the two kung fu masters (Kang Xi Jia and Hak On Fung) attack the three poor Pig Sty Town residents that have superb martial arts skills, while the landlady screams at them from above to keep quiet.  The two kung fu masters are very good until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.  The Axe Gang then decides to recruit a very powerful kung fu master known only as The Beast (Hsiao Liang), who is located in a mental health asylum.  The Beast brings out the truth about who the landlord and landlady are, but Sing may discover things about himself as well.<br /><br />With interesting kung fu choreography enhanced with computer-generated special effects and humor, \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" is entertaining, but some people may find some parts of it a bit too violent.  If you enjoy kung fu films, then you will probably enjoy this entertaining kung fu fantasy by Stephen Chow.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other interesting characters include Rabbit-Tooth Jane (Kai Shi Chen), Donut (Zhi Hua Dong), Coolie (Yu Xing), the Axe Gang Advisor (Kai Man Tin), the Tailor (Chi Ling Chiu), the Axe Gang Vice General (Suet Lam) and the Crocodile Gang Boss (Xiaogang Feng).until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.

B000268QB2|5.0|Keane (pronounced Keen) is an impressive band that truly baffles me with its remarkable sincerity.  \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is simplistic music--one singer, one bass guitar, a pianist, and a drummer. That's it. Yet  every time I listen it bewilders me how lavish and solid the music is.  Every musician is altogether in harmony and balance.  Furthermore they equip Tom and the songs the absolute best way possible.  Tom's voice is unbelievable; his range is mindblowing, his intonation and phrasing are perfect and his heart is exposed.  I can't find anything wrong with this album which astonishes me.  I've listened to \\"Hopes and Fears\\" obsessively off and on for weeks at a time always fully expecting to get sick of it--but I never do! Each and every song can solidly stand alone and yet holistically, the cd is painstakingly and exhaustively gorgeous. I Love listening to Keane and I Love singing along; I Love it during the day, I Love it at night.  It's the Real Deal.  I give \\"Hopes and Fears\\" one of my highest recommendations.  I think it should be in every music lover's library. Thank you, Keane. o8E<br /><br />Soar!
B00005JNTX|5.0|i love Sin City. its now one of my favorite movies, its true what people are saying it is the next Pulp Fiction. the story like Pulp fiction has three storys that very briefly interlock. the first story is about Marv, a thug who awakes to find the hooker Goldie whom he slept with is dead. taking justice into his own hands he finds out her killer is a canibalistic maniac named Kevin. the second is about Dwight who after defending a bartender from a crooked man named Jackie boy follows him to Old Town, a red light distrivt area. after a grave misunderstanding he kills Jackie boy and finds out he's a cop and now the truce of Old Town is gone. now Dwight must get rid of the body and its evidence. the final story is about Hartigen who in the begining of the story saves a girl name Nancy Callihan from a raving raper named Junior. finding iut its the senators son he is sent to jail and charged for all of his sons crimes. Nancy thanks him and writes under an alias but after eight years the letters stop and he fears she was found. confessing to everything he tracks down and finds she is now a stripper at a club and realizes...he was set up. now he must protect Nancy from the same lunatic who tried to kill her. i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This movie returned Batman to his dark roots, and don't get me wrong, I like Batman with Michael Keaton, despite its many flaws, but that doesn't even come close to touching Batman Begins. The only thing that does is the animated series from the 90s. (Mark Hamill will forever be The Joker in my mind, and let's face it Jack was just being Jack, not the Clown Prince of Crime) Great film, score, acting, action, plot, etc. I can't say enough good things about it. The ending just sets up the sequels so beautifully. It makes reference to Batman: Year One. Batman Begins is the Batman film I've been waiting for. <br /> <br />As for the other guys comments on Bale's Batman sucking. I don't get how you get sucking, especially since sucking would imply something horrible and nothing could be worse than either Kilmer or Clooney's Batman. Batman Begins was about Batman/Bruce Wayne. Batman was about the Joker more so than Batman. And Bale made Batman frightening (i.e. the scene where he takes out Falcone's thugs, and the scene where he interogates Flass) Anyway, it's not just an amazing comic book movie, it's an amazing movie, and the first live action Batman movie to get it right.

B000A0GP0Y|1.0|In most instances the characters on this movie just recite the same lines as in the 1974 original except when Crewe unnecessarily explains his actions to his team mates. Their biggest achievements appear to be a basketball game to convince the black inmates to join them against the guards, vulgarizing the hilarious warden secretary from the original film and adding plenty of distateful jokes. Adam Sandler is his usual annoying and uncharming self and if you believe him as a pro-QB you probably beleived Burt Reynolds as \\"Boss Hogg\\". <br />What a waste of celuloid ! <br />
0553382179|5.0|I used to be a \\"Martha Stewart\\" type, prior to a horrible car accident leaving me with a head injury that forced me to re-learn how to read, write, walk, talk, etc. While dealing with Chronic Pain (a.k.a. Fibromyalgia)for all these years, I never re-learned how to organize myself, my home, my life, my office and all the space around me. Then I got married to a male version of a \\"S.H.E.\\", which made things even worse.    Fifteen years after the accident (long from my \\"Martha-days\\"), and many phone conversations about my husband complaining about all the clutter, a very dear friend of mine endlessly encouraged/begged me to visit [...] for over a year.  After a year of being hit over the head (sometimes that's what it takes), I finally got the point!  I was overwhelmed instantly by all of the information on her site, all of the reminder emails that I received in one day (and the 164 emails during long weekends that I spent visiting family).  It was a bit too much for me to handle, at first.  My dear friend decided to \\"FLY-wash\\" me instead.  She forwarded messages that she thought were applicable to my life and my unorganizational issues (to put it nicely).  They helped a bit, and spiked my interest.    I had been wondering how my dear friend managed 2 small children, full-time work, cooking meals, and keeping her house in an orderly state.  Now I know!!!!    \\"Sink Reflections\\" was the answer, for me.  It is condensed down without having to read hours of emails.  I read it.  Re-read it, and started to put the plan into action.  I am a \\"FLYbaby\\" ( = newbie), but my husband and step-son have noticed a difference after only one week!  I actually get dressed now, instead of spending all of my days in pjs.  The dishes are done.  The beds are made. And I am slowly getting the house in order so that I can invite drop-by visitors into my home without embarressment.    Anyone who has chronic fatigue, chronic pain, chronic messiness, or chronic anything, I STRONGLY URGE YOU to purchase \\"Sink Reflections: Overwhelmed? Disorganized? Living in Chaos?\\".  Once you have started the FLYLady system, then phase in the internet version with email reminders and testimonials.  If I can implement this system with my physical limitations, you certainly should be able to as well!    As side note:  I also purchased the book \\"Sidetracked Home Executives(TM) : From Pigpen to Paradise\\".  This also helped me create a new order to my life.  In addition, FLYLady's theories and practices are based on these authors' methodology.
B0009AM5JK|5.0|I loved this CD with a passion! It's different rom their first CD but was still amazing. I loved Feel Good INC. It just made me wanna dance forever. El Manana, Dirty Harry and Fire Coming Out f The Monkey's Head were among my other faves even though the other songs on the album were mind-blowing as well. I recommend this CD to everyone ever.
B000063DFN|5.0|You have to put this album into its proper perspective..<br /><br />I had the pleasure of being in high school when Maiden first came onto the scene.. I remember getting Killers right after it was released, as well as being the first kid on the block to buy the Maiden Japan EP.  Their live shows were unbelievable..<br /><br />We waited with baited breath every time their next album was going to be released.. The Number of the Beast was OK, and Piece of Mind Rocked (Who can forget Die With Your Boots On?).<br /><br />Then came Powerslave..  Again let's put this into perspective.. What was the state of Metal in 1984?<br /><br />Black Sabbath?  Let's see, Dio had left, to be replaced by Ian Gillian, and in 1983 they had just released 'Born Again' with the classic songs.... Oh that's right, 'Born Again' sucked.. Fortunately 'Born Again' was SOOOOOOOO bad, Gillian left and re-united with Deep Purple on 'Perfect Strangers' (what an awesome tour THAT was)<br /><br />Of course Dio did go on to release The Last in Line and Holy Diver, before he to went into the tank.<br /><br />Rainbow? They had broken up..See Deep Purple reunited..<br /><br />Scorpions?  BY 1984 they had sold out completely, so much so that when you compared them to their early stuff they were barely recognizable.<br /><br />Judas Priest?  See 'Scorpions'<br /><br />Def Leppard?  The only difference between them and the Scorps was that it only took Def Leppard 2 albums to sell out..<br /><br />Krokus? The Blitz.. Need I say more?<br /><br />So what did us head bangers have? Metallica was up and coming (actually They had Arrived) Ozzy was.. Well Ozzy was Ozzy.. Megadeth was still jamming, and there were a few others, but what was on the horizon?  Ratt, Dokken, Whitesnake ..AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br /><br />Then came Powerslave... I will never forget the first time we listen to it.. 'Losfer Words' was awesome and 'Back in the Village' absolutely blew us away, But none of us were prepared for the 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. We must have listen to that one song about 10 times that day...<br /><br />I have only 'worn out' a handful of Albums (Sabbath's Paraniod, Masters of Reality and Vol 4 to name a few) but Powerslave is one of them. It is arguably Maiden's Best Album (if not it's definately in the top 3), and when reviewing it you have to consider what the alternative was in 1984.. Ratt?<br /><br />So for anyone looking to buy some Maiden. look no further, or if you feel obligated to, look at \\"iron Maiden\\", \\"Killers\\" or \\"Piece of Mind\\", but whatever you do, skip Number of teh Beast until you have this one...<br /><br />Other 'must have' albums in my collection...

Nazareth's Hair of the Dog, and Razamanaz, Riot's (NOT QUIET RIOT) Fire Down Under,(probably the GREATEST HARD ROCK album ever released) anything by Stabbing Westward (some of the greatest lyrics ever incorporated in to songs), and finally anything by Tool and A perfect Circle (thank goodness someone is still making great music).worn out' a handful of Albums (Sabbath's Paraniod, Masters of Reality and Vol 4 to name a few) but Powerslave is one of them.

0895260131|1.0|It is interesting to see people think they know everything about a religion by reading a book written by a so-called 'expert' on Islam. I suggest to those who enjoyed this book, to take a college-level course on critical thinking. You may then be able to see things objectively, because it seems most of you are taking what the author says, and running with it as if it's the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  <br /> <br />If I wanted to build a home, I would NOT hire my physician who only knows what a home looks like, to build it. Similarly, if I wanted to learn about the Christian tradition, it would be foolish to ask a Buddhist monk to teach me. Get the drift?  <br /> <br />Being a Muslim, I can see that there are many things which are being distorted about the religion. If you are really sincere in wanting to learn about Islam, Google up a local Mosque and ask someone who REALLY knows the religion, and not someone who only pretends to... <br /> <br />May God guide you all to the Truth...
0553382179|5.0|I've been babystepping myself for a few years now and there are a few things to keep in mind:  <br /> <br />Its more about attitude changes than a book full of tips that you may or may not put into practice and may or may not stick with (been there before myself).  Its about reprogramming your thinking towards housework and setting up systems and routines that you tailor for your own home and your own life.  Its about putting those tips you get from other books into practice.  Its about getting rid of the junk you don't need in your life to make room for actually ENJOYING your life. <br /> <br />Yes, Marla Cilley is Christian and she's not shy about it but its far from \\"Cleaning your house with God\\" as some of the reviewers have made it sound.

B00000G3AZ|3.0|If you like Northam and Paltrow, this is a movie you should watch. It is entertaining, although I find that Paltrow is not British enough for my taste and Northam, although a good actor does not do full justice to the character of mr Knightly (or maybe it was the script). There is too much obvious comedy whereas I always think that the comedy in Austen does not come from 'funny' acting, but is derived from the characters and their dialogues. <br /> <br />I'll stick to the other Emma with Kate Beckinsale. This version is much more true to the spirit of Austen in my opinion and Mark Strong is perfectly cast as a very serious mr Knightly and Emma has just enough arrogance about her person to make it believable. Even the smaller roles in this version are very very good. <br /> <br />

B00007K02F|2.0|Let me first say that I think Zeffirelli is a great director and he has done some wonderful things for opera (I love his otello with Domingo). Also I understand that every director and script writer has his/her own interpretation of a book. But it does not justify the cutting to pieces of the main story, juggling with the characters in the book, leaving out three quarters of the story and changing plotlines so much that if this movie had not been called Jane Eyre, I would hardly have recognized it. <br /> <br />Now for the actors, I think there were some serious miscasts here. Gainsbourgh is a very romantic Jane, nothing of the passion a Jane Eyre should have, nothing intelligent. <br /> <br />William Hurt I really loved in the Big Chill, but this was the worst miscast. He does not seem at ease with the role and was just too sad and too romantic, nothing exacting or fastidious. I always imagined Rochester as a little bit sad but also angry at fate and life in general. <br /> <br />The two stars are for the filmic qualities and the music. The movie itself is very much confusing as it tends to 'hop' from one scene to the other. It is too fragmented to be enjoyable. <br /> <br />Just stick to the Dalton/Clarke BBC mini series which is now available on DVD and at a very good price too.

B000024D4R|4.0|This isn't really a review for the album, but it is something a little different...         During the tour for Animals in 1977, the \\"In the Flesh\\" tour, Pink Floyd played this album in its entirety.  After a short break they played the entire Wish You Were Here album and the song Money was the encore for the entire tour.  On one occasion they also added Us and Them to the encore. On one date, because the band was please that the audience actually listened to the music through out the show, they played Money, Us and Them, and Careful With that Axe Eugene (they hadn't played this song in years and it would be the last time they would ever play it live). A bootleg of this show is available on eBay.         During the final show of the tour in Montreal - the infamous show where Roger spat at a guy in the audience which became one of the factors leading to concept for The Wall -  Roger refused to come out for the encore so second quitarist Snowy White switched to bass for Money.         Although they played the entire Animals album, they changed the song order (due to time constraints, they could not have put this sequence on the original vinyl - the 8-track, for those who remember that format, is another story).     As there isn't an official live release of the tour; you can get an idea of what went on by sequencing the tracks as follows:    IN THE FLESH tour    1. Sheep  2. Pigs On The Wing (Part 1)  3. Dogs  4. Pigs On The Wing (Part 2)  5. Pigs (Three Different Ones)    break (go get yourself a drink or use the litter box)    6. Wish You Were Here (entire album as is)    encore    7. Money     8. Us and Then (if you were really good)      PLAY LOUD!!      P.S. I give this album 4 stars becouse Dogs is not one of my favorite songs.  At 17 minutes I have to be in the mood for it before I can really enjoy it. Usually, I only play side 2 (think vinyl): Pigs (Three Different Ones), Sheep, Pigs on the Wing (Part Two).     My favorite Pink Floyd album is.....................................................................................................................OBSCURED BY CLOUDS

B000002KIE|5.0|Well have read a couple of reviews and just threw them....this album was the defining moment for all the music that is being heard this present day. <br />In 1977 we were all on a hangover from \\"Dinosaur\\" rock still....and who should emerge with one of the most potent albums in years...yes the SEX PISTOLS ! <br />They for me being someone who was growing up on \\"middle of the road pop music\\" from America and even the UK (i am in Australia) was like the ultimate smack about the head....it made me think that hey music is alive and confronting the older generation of my time.....and it was ! <br />So for this reviewer it isnt just all music but a society smacking LISTEN TO US. <br />The music on the album is absolutely fantastic and (christ am sounding like a hippie).....but it is damn ass kicking make a statement feel empowered ultra fantasmagorical !!! <br />

B0000025HG|5.0|In October of 1979, Barbra Streisand had released her twenty-fifth album entitled WET. The album is appropriately titled and describes water in different ways, like tears on \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\", & \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\", the ultimate diva duet with Donna Summer, rain on \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\", \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\", \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\", and \\"After The Rain\\", waterfalls on \\"Niagra\\", water on \\"Splish Splash\\", or just being wet on \\"Wet\\".     WET  A beautiful song that sounds like the music was carefully thought out. This one should not be ignored.     COME RAIN OR COME SHINE  Great.     SPLISH SPLASH  I hate the original song. I can't even remember who had originally sang this song. Barbra's version here is the version I actually like. She made the song worth listening to.    ON RAINY AFTERNOONS  Very nice.     AFTER THE RAIN  Very nice.     NO MORE TEARS (ENOUGH IS ENOUGH) (Duet with Donna Summer)  There have been many great DIVA duets, like the remake of LADY MARMALADE and that was performed by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, & Pink. But no DIVA duet will be as great as this one. It's the ultimate DIVA duet. This was the original version and it runs to 8 minutes and 19 seconds. In late 1979, Donna Summer released her first greatest hits. That compilation contains this song. However, the version on Donna's hits is different. For starters, it has the original music in it, but there is a disco mix beat added to it. Instead of running to 8 minutes and 19 seconds, like the original, it runs to 11 minutes and 43 seconds. Still the #1 Ultimate DIVA duet. This song was almost left off of the album because it was only titled \\"Enough Is Enough\\", but with the name change of \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\", where tears are a form of water, the song was saved and included on the album.    NIAGARA  Beautiful song. This song is very touching and very pleasing and relaxing, especially in that saxophone solo. Beautiful song all the way.    I AIN'T GONNA CRY TONIGHT  Great.    KISS ME IN THE RAIN  Very nice. A beautiful song that I love listening to.        This album was just absolutely amazing and is my all-time favorite Barbra Streisand album. This album is very brilliant and the concept is just amazing. I don't think this concept had ever been done before Barbra Streisand had even thought of it. Please, believe me when I say that this album is just amazing, so please, buy it.

B000002549|5.0|In February of 1976, Barbra Streisand released her twenty-first album entitled, CLASSICAL BARBRA. I was expecting this album to be really bad, like a one-star rating, but I could not believe how relaxing this album was.

Her voice is just so unique and so powerful that we cannot help ourselves when we feel those chills run up and down our bodies. CLASSICAL BARBRA is a definitely amazing album and it should be owned by every Barbra fan.
B00005JNTX|5.0|\\"I Don't Know About You But I'am Having a Ball!\\" - Marv<br /><br />Sin City is one of the best movies to come out in a while. It's visually stunning and fun to watch. The characters are larger then life and fun to follow throughout the movie. This movie is Rodriquez's Pulp Fiction. Using Frank Miller's character's and story, he creates a movie you can watch over and over again. Mickey Rourke is perfect and is without a doubt the best character in the film. This movie has it all. Great action, Comedy, Story, Acting, and eye candy. Buy this movie and visit Sin City!
B0000025JT|5.0|In September of 1980, Barbra Streisand released her twenty-sixth album entitled, GUILTY. This album is very good in its own way, despite one song that I cannot stand. But this album is very enjoyable. Please read on and find out. <br /> <br />GUILTY (Duet with Barry Gibb) <br />  The album's title track. Apparently, this is the first album that Barbra Streisand has ever done with the title track being a duet with another recording star. This is the only song I really hate from this album. I hate it with a passion. <br /> <br />WOMAN IN LOVE <br />  This is one of the best songs on the album. Great song. <br /> <br />RUN WILD <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />PROMISES <br />  Great. <br /> <br />THE LOVE INSIDE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WHAT KIND OF FOOL (Duet with Barry Gibb) <br />  This is the second duet on this album with Barry Gibb. This song is a lot better than the title track. Plus, it is just a great song in general. Just to refresh everyone's memory here, Barry Gibb is a member of the band, The Bee Gees. <br /> <br />LIFE STORY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />NEVER GIVE UP <br />  That is so damn right. Don't ever give up. Great song. <br /> <br />MAKE IT LIKE A MEMORY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />    This is an album that everybody should already own. If not, then make sure you buy GUILTY, because if you don't, I'll make sure you are \\"Guilty\\" of that crime.

B000002HMH|2.0|...It was about the old Metallica meeting the new greedy b**ta**s. The younger James said to the older one \\"how could you let me turn into you?\\" and continued to toss a match onto his gel-ridden hair and watch him explode. The mullet Lars Ulrich beat up the greedy one, and then pissed on him. Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted teamed up with Kirk Hammetts younger self and threw the older Hammett off of a cliff. Megadeth Mustaine and Metallica Mustaine just stood there and laughed, while Slayer and Anthrax cried at the fact that a once musically beautiful and talented band had turned into a bunch of money-hungry f**ks! <br />(this dream was TOO true) <br /> <br />Well, I guess that 'Aint My B**ch' and 'King Nothing' are decent songs, but the rest is crap and proves how lazy Metallica became.

B000002C1W|4.0|Much to the suprise, and delight, of Pink Floyd fans \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" was released in 1987 sans Roger Waters. Now that time has passed, and so has the novelty, it seems Pink Floyd fans are more than eager to criticize this disc. Some even have the audacity to call it a fraud, or as Roger Waters summed it up \\"a pretty fair forgery\\". I disagree. <br /> <br />I'll be the first to admit that the record does sound more like a David Gilmour & studio musicians album than it does Pink Floyd. Nonetheless, tell me what sounds better--David Gilmour & studio musicians or Roger Waters & studio musicians (i.e. \\"The Final Cut\\"). I rest my case.  <br /> <br />The record is pretty solid. The only complaint I really have is that David Gilmour should have waited to get Rick Wright fully back in the band before he started this record. Although fans are often quick to complain about a lack of Roger Waters, it seems few fans really appreciate Rick Wright. He alone truly adds the atmosphere and mood to Pink Floyd's music. Compare this record to \\"Division Bell\\" and you can see the difference. The latter has more of the Pink Floyd sound because you can here the interplay between Gilmour, Mason & Wright and less of the programmed sequenced synthasizers that dominate this disc. <br /> <br />All that being said, it is, despite any of its shortcomings, a great record. It contains of course the radio hits \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\", but like any Pink Floyd record, there are more than just the radio songs. In my opinion \\"Yet Another Movie\\" and \\"Sorrow\\" and just as strong, if not stronger, songs. Even better is we are once again treated to Pink Floyd instrumentals. \\"Signs of Life\\" and \\"Terminal Frost\\" stand as probably the most evocative and emotional songs on the record. The only song that I can honestly say I don't care for is \\"The Dogs of War\\" and even that is not horrible, it is just not my cup of tea.  <br /> <br />All that being said give it a try. David Gilmouris still in top form and the songs and lyrics are good. Many complain that the lyrics are not as good as Roger Waters, but after hearing him bicker and gripe through \\"A Final Cut\\", I was glad to give Gilmour a try and you should too. After all, this record should be judged on the merit for what it is and to that end I can say that it ranks up there as a strong effort.

B0009I2LBO|5.0|This is a superlative film of suspense. It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment, the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.<br /><br />Professional photographer L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.<br /><br />This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him. Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing propels the film to an exciting climax.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!rific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him.

1573223026|4.0|The innovative starting point for this novel is 4 people inadvertently meet on a rooftop on New year's Eve.  Each is intent on committing suicide by jumping.  Needless to say they don't.  However, the experience causes them to form an unlikely bond and they become a \\"gang\\", meeting intermittently over the next ninety days (one learns that a researcher has theorized that the urge for suicide slacks after ninety days).    The major conflict of the book is set up immediately - these are four very distinctly different people - a middle-aged woman, a former TV star, an American rocker and a foul-mouthed teenager.  The only thing they have in common is their failed attempt at suicide.      Hornby fills the book with very good dialogue.  The story is related character by character, so that there are often overlapping perspectives on the same event.  The changing perspectives keeps the book interesting.    The characters all have depth and are believeable.  Although they at first blush appear to stereotypic, as the reader gets to know them and their most intimate thoughts, they become unique. None are particularly likeable, although the middle aged woman is sympathetic.    At about the middle of the book, it slowed as the characters got a bit bogged in excessive introspection.  It must be difficult to keep a lot of motion and action when using four depressed people to tell the story.  However, Hornby then picked the pace.      Hornby also maintains a melancholy humor throughout.  Without that humor the depressed nature of the characters' lives and moods would have been too difficult to slog through, especially since the reader never gets a \\"rooting\\" interest for any of the characters.    This is an interesting look at the characters' lives and their perspectives on their own lives as well as the others'.  Also, an interesting investigation of suicide and suicidal people.  Not a happy go lucky read, but interesting and well-written.

Only one complain here, and it's one that has already been made a hundred times. Although Gerard Butler is a very good actor, he cannot sing very well. BUt oh well I did not let that bother, cause I enjoyed the movie on so many different aspects. The scene at the top of the opera house is very well done. Emmy Rossum is a great singer, she is just as good if not better than most Christine's i've seen in the play. Patrick Wilson cans also sing ve well and he did a fine job. But the real mastermind behind this movie was mr Schumacher, who translated the play in to this beautiful movie.
B000001F5F|5.0|'Under A Blood Red Sky'is a 8 track EP tribute to the fans. U2 packaged together their favourite concert performances and shared it with their fans. What a great album (even though the album could have had more songs or at least some enhanced multimedia). Truly the best songs were played on this album in fine Live format, with the background crowd heard cheering, clapping and singing along with many of the songs clearly and concisely. It was a good recording (not like some recordings where you can't hear the crowd participation at all). The standout songs played Live in this album were 'Gloria' an all-time immortal fan favourite, 'I Will Follow' a touching song especially played Live, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' always will be a rebel song. My favourite was the live performance of 'New Years Day'.<br /><br />This CD is for any fan of U2, past or present.
B00000DFSK|4.0|It's a great compilation for the first part of U2's career. <br /> <br />What would have made it perfect would have the live version of \\"Bad\\" from \\"Wide Awake in America\\" instead of the studio version and the inclusion of \\"October\\" and \\"40\\" (live from \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\").  The only other flaw is the edited version of \\"New Years Day\\". <br /> <br />When are record companies going to finally realize that music fans HATE when they edit songs???  It's a CD, for Christ sakes!  There's always room!
B000001DTM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this monumental album from U2. This album was produced and constructed whilst the band were touring Germany...a nice blend of german ideas meshing with good ol' Irish ingenuity mixed with the classic lovable sound of U2. The old sound of U2 in the album was left behind. The sound of the 1980's ceased as Bono and crew decided to take the band into new territory with a more concentrated rock sound and feel. This album was initially released in 1991 and features the hit songs of 'One', 'Even Better Than The Real Thing', 'Mysterious Ways' and 'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses'. These songs mentioned are beautiful and widely known and loved by U2 fans and fans of rock music regardless. The introduction of varied synths mixed with thrumming bass brought a new deeper edge style to the already complex sound of U2. Bono and The Edge again have brought together a solid framework and all fans should be pleased by the content and result.

The band showcases there heavy side on the opener \\"blackest eyes\\". Elsewhere the vocal haromies shimmer with clarity especially in tracks like \\"sound of muzak\\" and \\"prodigal\\". The band doesnt abandon the ambient beauty of the past in \\"3\\" swelling against spaced out drum grooves, slow burn guitar wahs, against gorgeous swelling strings. The band also groovbes in dark Tool-eque structures ala \\"Strip the Soul\\". Also to contrubtive atmospheric effect the keyboards work tranquil beauty in \\"gravity eyelids\\" and \\"heart attack in a layby\\". The album closer is simply goregous. acompanied by mellow and sad piano chords while singer Steve Wilson sings with deep emotion of parting, building gradually along the beautiful arranged strings, as he repeatedly confesses \\"collapse the light into earth\\". The band is not likely to wow metal fans for its lack of metallic edge (mainly to the note of Steve Wilson involement with the prog-doom metal outfit Opeth),but the shere beauty in some of the songs,and the great atmospheric spell some of the songs cast surely makes one wonder why this went under the radar since it strikes the near perfect balance of harmony,heaviness,ecentricty,hooks,atomsphere,techinque,and at time beauty. easily a landmark in modern prog
B000001FTQ|4.0|This mini-album EP version contains live in concert reprises of 'Bad' and 'A Sort Of Homecoming'. However just as in previous reviews, I would like to warn that this is not the LIVE versions performed at LiveAid in 1985. But this 8 minute rendition of 'Bad' is great in it's own right. Song 3 'Three Sunrises' and song 4 'Love Comes Tumbling' are actual B-Sides of U2 finally released as fillers for this EP. 'Three Sunrises' was an experimental song that made the Irish group sound like wanna be 'Beatles'. 'Love Comes Tumbling', well this is a U2 sounding song through and through with a catchy tune and a enjoyable song to listen to.<br /><br />This EP would only suit the fanatical fans of U2 and collectors of anything U2.
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's follow up to his masterpiece, born to run is indeed one of his best albums. Masterpieces include \\"Badlands\\" \\"Adam raised a cane\\" \\"Darkness on the edge of town\\" and \\"Candy's room\\" are terrific. His best album? Probebly not but definitly a classic.
0790729407|5.0|After watching this ,I ws sorry to have missed it when it was out on the big screen. The movie never lagged as it took you  through the republican Movement in Ireland fromm 1916 10 1922. The acting is superb. If you don't enjoy it for it's message, you will enjoy a greataction flick!
1400095913|5.0|Sweet and simple - buy this book.<br /><br />We are introduced to Dexter Morgan in this debut book - he was given permission by his foster father to do what he does best - kill - but only to the people who deserve the task.<br /><br />This novel is a hoot - who are the bad guys and who are the heroes? DDD is darkly funny, darkly disturbing, but a great quick read.<br /><br />Keep 'em coming JL!
B00068IOWM|5.0|This is a beautiful collector's item, extremely high quality - as I'm used to expect from U2.  I love the cd, listen to it often.  It has some of the finest songs U2 has ever released - they just seem to get better and better. The dvd is great and the book is very interesting and unusual.
1573223026|3.0|I love the fact that there are loads of great reviews on here for this book and many of those same reviews cannot even remember the correct names of the characters.  Honestly, how can you pen a 5 star review and get a detail like that wrong? 5 star to me = something memorable, something worth your time. Now that my vent fest is over - here's my review: <br /> <br />I really liked the plot. I found it to be refreshingly original.  It centers around 4 people from very different backgrounds all of whom are intent on killing themselves.  Somehow they all end up atop the Toppers House on the same evening and all of them want to jump.  It's a bungling scene in which none of them actually jump.  Instead, they form a little group of friends despite having nothing in common other than the desire to end their own lives.  Hornby seems to have an accurate handle on depression as a subject matter and he is quite capable of writing in the masculine and feminine voice. Most of the book was shocking funny for such a dire topic. So, what didn't I like about this book? I did not like the fact that background information on the characters was at times altogether missing or came late.  Case in point: Maureen.  I have no clue as to how her son came to be in his vegetative state.  I \\"get\\" why she'd want to end her life - I'd just prefer a little more background.  My rating of the book is based primarily on the ending.  I hated it.  No loose eneds were tied up.  The story just sort of stopped. It was like having a blackout occur in the middle of watching the season finale of your favorite sitcom.  Up until the ending I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  I don't see how anyone could say it's better than High Fidelity. I certainly did not think so but I suppose that's a matter of preference.  I could see age being a definite factor in that opinion though.  I read this as part of a book club and would not recommend it as a book club read if you plan on having a \\"serious\\" discussion: namely the resolution of conflict, etc...
B00062ZE3U|4.0|I simply love this cd. I have recently discovered WITHIN TEMPTATION. I bought \\" THE SILENT FORCE \\" due to the rave reviews given on this and many other sites. The first listen didnt grab me right away, with the exception of the song \\" STAND MY GROUND\\". That song had that radio single quality to it, not that theres anything wrong with that.   <br />             After that first listen, it completely grabbed me. This is a talented band. The song, \\"ANGELS\\" , is my favorite. If you ever put someone you were in love with up on a pedestal only to later discover that they are not worthy of such a place in your heart then you will completely understand the lyrics to this song.    <br />                 If you have never heard WITHIN TEMPTATION, then heres what to expect. First, their music has a heavy symphonic feel to it. Its metal , classical, and opera all perfectly mixed together to make an awesome combination. The singer is one of my favorite vocalists in the music world, period. Ther will be the inevitable comparisons to EVANESCENCE but in truth, I feel that EVANESCENCE just dont live up. In fact, I consider EVANESCENCE to be a rip off of them. WITHIN TEMPTATION has been making this style of music many years ahead of them.   <br />              I highly recommend this cd to anyone. ANd check out some other similiar bands such as; NIGHTWISH, THE GATHERING, and LACUNA COIL. The Metal Historian recommends. <br /> <br />
B00009ATKS|5.0|Obviously I love this CD. Mogwai is one of my favorite bands (they and Do Make Say Think alternate for the top spot). Listen to the clips to get a taste.  <br /> <br />Don't start with this, I'd say. Go with 'Young Team' for that. Mogwai has shown an excellent, steady, progression since 1997. <br /> <br />I wanted to add, though, that the title is in no way ironic.
B00025ETIW|5.0|MCR is the best band ever........hands down . they rock my world with their lovley lyrics and hot moves. their songs are so punk meets emo meets heavy metal and i slit my writsts with a red permanent marker every time i listen. eneryone should listen to them cauze they are soooooooooo duah cool!!!!! i would give this band 700000000000000000000000 stars but amazon wont let me (jerks) lol ...... :)....... jk <br /> <br />see ya'll later skater <br /> <br /> <br />listen to MCR!!!!!
B0000584V3|5.0|I know some would say the subject of my review is a bold statement, but I say it with 100% sincerity.  This album introduced me to the compositional genius that is Opeth, and, even after hearing their other albums, I believe it is their best.  The diverse perfection of the first track \\"The Leper Affinity\\" will make your jaw drop.  It features an unorthodox spectrum ranging from death metal to piano composition, yet it never sounds as if it is going in too many directions.  Seriously, each song is like a metal opus in its own right.  There is literally something for every metal fan on this album.  If you appreciate superb composition as opposed to mass produced metalcore crap, you need to check this CD and this band out.
0375713751|2.0|Being a working mom, I don't have much time to read so I got the audio version of \\"I don't know how she does it.\\" And I don't - I really don't - know how anyone got all the way through this book. Sure, Pearson makes some solid points about the delicate balance between work and home life and the jumble it can all be, but her character comes across as crass and uncaring about the people she should care about most: her family. I finally gave up on the audio version when I couldn't listen to another moment of Kate's complaints. She's all complaints, no solutions and she seems to be the only one who matters. Her selfishness was appalling. Thank god I only rented this from the library!
B000007MVL|5.0|As a sophomore this is amazing and as an album it is wonderful!<br /><br />The music on this album is very quaint and tightly structured.<br /><br />\\"Lionheart\\" is probably the most 'english' album of all time.<br /><br />With bold refrences to mostly everything remotely english this album is possibly an ode to her home country.<br /><br />With subjects ranging from murder,affairs and death this album is certainly not lacking in subject matter.<br /><br />Although the main thing that attracts about this album is it's beauty and majesty.<br /><br />Kate's voice as usual is phenomenal, an individual rarity you may say.<br /><br />Highlights on this album include the wonderful \\"Coffee Homeground\\", the groovy \\"Hammer Horror\\" and the lusty \\"Don't Push Your Foot On The Heartbrake\\".<br /><br />Spectacular imagery is also a treat here and you really feel what she is trying to get across. Overall, \\"Lionheart\\" is one of the most spectacular and superb albums ever and will appeal to a wide range of musical tastes.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|a new friend recommended this, and i loved it because it sounded beautiful and romantic and sweet and all the other amazing things that sarah can do with her voice.  then i listened to it.  and now i need it. <br /> <br />the whole album to me is a prayer.  please, listen again, think of whatever to you is God, and listen to each and every lyric.  think of your relationship with your God, move yourself through the music, take a different approach to what and who she may be singing about.   <br /> <br />what does it mean to you now? <br /> <br />this album is precious to me.  as a prayer tool.  a meditation tool.  a way of focusing on everything i need to be aware of, of what and how i need to change. <br /> <br />yes, it's just music....but it got me. <br /> <br />if you're already a christian, take it to study group and play it.  listen to it with people who care and share it.  if you're not already there - please, take a listen and sneak a preview into how it feels.  it's beautiful. <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|First, I want to say that it's stupid that rock lovers and rap haters are rating rap albums.  <br />I have been through the most in hip-hop, but I still think this album is some of the worst I've heard... People should know better than buying this album. Go buy yourself 36 chambers by the Wu-Tang and Moment of truth by Gang Starr. It's two legendary rap albums. When you've listened to them, you've got a start. QUIT BYING THIS CRAP!
B000002J09|5.0|I don't know what to say, hundreds have said to buy this, I don't know how I'm going to convince you if you already haven't & if you don't like this well that's up to you but I suggest you either give it another listen or check you brought the right CD or that the CD is the right one, or the shop you got it from distributed the right CD!!! <br /> <br />Every track is basically a gem. There's alot of diversity for eight tracks too, funk (Black Dog) rock (Rock & Roll, Misty Mountain Hop, Four Sticks) folk (Going to California) blues (When the Levee Breaks) oh and Stairway to Heaven in its full 8 minute edition, not the silly radio edit. In short Zep IV is Zeps I, II, & III all put together (if you already have Zep's I, II, & III, buy this, if not then I suggest you buy them as they are just as essential) <br /> <br />To conclude... <br /> <br />To conclude???  <br /> <br />Are u still reading this, buy this damn album...unless you already have!!!!
B00080Z53O|5.0|Javier Bardem gives another brilliant performance. <br />Based on a true story. <br />  For 26 years, Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has been bed-ridden.  He can not move his body, but his head.  With his mouth, he can hold a writing instrument.  He has been telling his family he would like to die.  He can not enjoy his life outside.  He had snapped his neck when the undertow pulled back after he jumped into the sea. He is currently going through a legal petition to have the right to die when he chooses.  Rosa sees Ramon's interview on television and decides to visit this man for the first time.  She likes him, but Ramon of course feels intruded upon and becomes sarcastic.  She leaves.  While on her radio show, she apoligizes to him and encourages him to make a request.   <br />  Ramon has mentioned he still visits the sea, but pretends he flies there. <br />  Will he find a reason to live or die with dignity. <br />  DVD includes deleted scenes in \\"Special Features\\", but none with Bardem. <br />  Also included is a documentary of the making of \\"The Sea Inside\\" with video of the real Ramon Sampedro.  Also see how Javier bardem had to prepare his body to play someone paralyzed.
B000002J0B|5.0|When the band were recording Houses of the Holy they were lapping up the records of their previous commercial success of their fouth album. And although it would have been easy to do another Zep IV, Zeppelin, being Zeppelin, decided to shock their fans again (like they did in III) and make an album mainly of funk tunes, but in a way only Led Zeppelin could, naturally!!!! <br /> <br />The Song Remains the same, which starts the album, has one hell of a mean riff, and anyone who says Zep can't rock should listen to this & then shut up. The Rain Song softens things up, whilst Over the hills & far away is a great gem, a beautifully crafted song, one of my personal Zep favourites. The Crunge & Dancing Days is when the funk starts, well it's more Zep funk, whilst D'yer Mak'er is a reggae tune, yes you heard me right, reggae. No Quarter, which follows, is one of the strongest on the album, whilst The Ocean is classic funk rock!!!! <br /> <br />Overall Houses of the Holy is one of Zeppelin's most enjoyable listens, there are some iffy stuff along the way, The Rain Song, though alot of people I know like this I have always thought of it as Stairway to Heaven two but not as good, whilst The Crunge, well, can someone direct this song to that confronded bridge!!! But the rest is so good that you hardly realise these very minor hicups. Perhaps the weakest of the six classics (Zeps I, II, II, IV, & Physical Graffiti + this) but still it's a damn great listen!!!!
6304602979|5.0|This is an amazing movie. But be patient, you may think people getting married after 3 days or so of knowing each other is stupid, but hang on. Then the action kicks in, the couple find $500,000 worth of coke belonging to the mob. Buth they want to sell it and start their lives again somewhere nice. Superb acting from not only the stars (Slater and Arquette) but the supports and extras (Pitt, Kilmer, Walken, Oldman, Sizemore) too. Great original story and very gripping, nice chunk of action and an ending that'll blow you away and leave you wanting more and more and more. One to buy for sure and to watch over and over. Enjoy!
B00008OWZC|5.0|I'm a very big Led Zep fan, I've got all their albums, I think they're all great (especially the first six) but the only downer was their live stuff. The Song Remains the Same CD & film were ok but hardly thunderous & at times some of the perfomances seemed lazy or tiring. Well thank God they released this & the even more spectacular DVD!!!! <br /> <br />How the west was won is one of the best live rock CD's I've ever heard, if not of all time. There are no lazy or tired performances, and even Dazed & Confused, Moby Dick & Whole Lotta Love, all which clock in at nearly 30 minutes aren't as tiring as they seemed on The Song Remains the Same. The big highlight for me was the accoustic set as this showed that Zep were more than just a heavy band. How the West was won is basically 3 discs of live brilliance!!! <br /> <br />Overall if you're a Zep fan you need this album as it is the best live Zep document out there & whilst you're at it you'd just as well buy the DVD that was released at the same time as this album. How the West was won has finally restored my faith in the fact that not only were Led Zeppelin were one of the greatest live acts but they were perhaps the greatest band that ever lived!!!!
0767802551|4.0|This movie was better than i expexted it to be. Really delving into the mob and mafia families, showing the lives of fear and the danger of living as a wiseguy. For example vouching for someone who dosn't deliver gets you killed. So imagine the danger that an undercover FBI agent is in. There you have Donnie Brasco. A great movie, really tense, and showing a side of wiseguys not usually shown in the movies in the Pacino character 'Lefty' who is poor and basically a donkey worker.  With great acting from Al and Depp, the only thing that lets this movie down from 5 stars is the scatty story which is based on actual events. A bit here and there though i thought. All in all a great movie. Enjoy!
B00008PX8P|5.0|If there ever was a 30 dollars that was money well spent well this is it. From the Royal Albert Hall on disc 1, to Madison Square Garden, Earls Court & Knebworth on disc 2. The extras are great too. Disc 1 has a performance of Zeppelin in 1969 on Danish radio, with a promotion video for their first US single release Communication Breakdown, also a great live performance of Dazed & Confused, not forgetting their first and only TV performance anywhere!!! <br /> <br />Disc 2 extras include a US interview with the band the day that the album Led Zeppelin II knocked The Beatles Abbey Road at the top of the album charts and therefore became the bands first US number 1 album. It also includes an Australian interview of the band days before the release of the greatest rock album ever Led Zeppelin IV, and an interview with Robert Plant on the UK's Old Grey Whistle Test, where they talk about the bands upcoming release Physical Graffiti, and a possibility of a UK tour. And if that ain't enough there's special promos of Over the hills & far Away & Riverside Blues (a previously unreleased track, although it's also available on BBC Sessions). <br /> <br />Overall this DVD is amazing value for money & is a must have for all Led Zeppelin fans, & also it is a good way to get other people into Zeppelin as some of the live performances are extraordinary. It could be the best five & a half hours of your life with Percy, Pgey, Bonzo & Jonesy that you ever spend, so buy this now, trust me you won't be dissapointed!!!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Five Stars isn't enough to rate this CD, personally I think it deserves much more than that. Every song on this CD is different from the other and they are ALL very good, which is a rare find. It takes a little while for most people to get into Coldplay CD's. The first time I listened to it, I thought \\"not so great\\" but now it's all I listen to. The lyrics are quite different compared to there other compilations. You can definately tell they have grown. I would recommend this to anyone that has a good ear for music. Bottom line: These lyrics just stick in your mind long after the song is finished.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin III is perhaps Zeps most controversal album, not because it has explicit lyrics or Robert Plant (or God forbid Bonzo) decided to go nude to promote the album, no, because from the heavy nature of the first two, Zeppelin decided in response to the critics who claimed that Zeppelin were just a heavy band, who were just a fad, Zeppelin in response decided to do an album of mainly accoustic tunes!!!    There are no obvious in sights at first though because Led III opens with Immigrant Song, one of Zeps many in a line of classic rock tracks, but that's were the heaviness ends, the next song Friends is purely accoustic, although fun, whilst Celebration Day is a more controlled heaviness. The album peaks with Since I've been loving you, the best track on the album & one of Zeppelin's finest. Out on the Tiles is another controlled rock song, whilst Tangerine is a beautiful sweet accoustic tune, followed by the nice accoustic That's the Way, Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp ends up being the most enjoyable track, whilst Hats of (To Roy Harper) is the weirdest (just listen for yourself).    Led Zeppelin III added another dimention to Zeps repetoir, and silenced any critics who claimed them just to be a heavy fad, but as irony would go they would end up being criticised for loosing heaviness & some said because of this Zeppelin couldn't rock & only sold records because it's Led Zeppelin. Well on their next release Zeppelin would decide to not credit themselves on their album nor their record company, and give it the least promotion possible, result...well that's another story, as for Led Zeppelin III it is Zep toned down but still with the quality, is this album underated??? you bet!!!!
B000002504|1.0|As mentioned elsewhere, this album is certainly <br />an acquired taste.  What comes off most strongly <br />is complexity for its own sake and not having any <br />real organic basis.  This was the only cd of theirs <br />I didn't hang onto.
B00080ZG10|4.0|That's Scosese. The movie is long, but the time past quickly.The best years of Howard Hughes' life are covered. It is easy to see, as he futzes with his first movie, \\"Hell's Angels\\", in the late 20's, that the man is crazy. He is also driven, a great pilot & charismatic genius careening towards insanity. <br />  It's the role of a lifetime & Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't waste it. Hughes was an aviation pioneer first & foremost & usually ahead of the competition, innovation-wise. His money was from oil & he dabbled in movies & movie stars. <br />  His notoriety catches up with him at the time when he is battling his obsessive-compulsive neurosis & most vulnerable. He is called to testify in front of a Senate committee to answer charges of war profiteering. It is a plot by the  corrupt Senator Owen Brewster to destroy Hughes & his airline TWA. The Senator (played beautifully by Alan Alda) is in the pocket of Pan Am, who seeks to monopolize all international flights. DiCaprio, as Hughes gives a tour de force performance destroying the Senator, in the best moments of the movie.  <br />   Movies like this are increasingly rare. There is star power, a great character driven script, a brillant director & lets not forget plenty of financing all coming together.
038572179X|2.0|Even though I am an avid, constant reader, I found this book a little difficult to get through.It was not because of the writing style - Ian McEwan's style and elegance are undeniable - but rather because of the slow unraveling of the plot. It is true that a lot of books require attention and patience from their readers, but this one, despite its brilliant style, fell short from being captivating and was definitely NOT a page turner for me. For me, a book is best if I forget I am reading. The writing focuses too much on its author and I was consistently aware of the style, which commands attention and could be condescending at times. I wished for a more readable book, without the occasional unnecessary, pretentious words, phrases and paragraphs. <br />The characters were very realistic and well thought out, but I still did not care much for any of them. They lacked compassion and humanity and left me cold and unmoved. <br />If you enjoy long, (LONG!)beautifully constructed descriptions of landscape, fountains, places and events, you will like this book. If, however, you are seeking a plot with movement and intensity, this book is not for you.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  The combination of some of the best vocalists in the industry with \\"the genius\\" worked to a tee.  We love it! <br />
0440419514|5.0|...disguised as a trilogy for children. The ideas here are challenging and profound. Read other reviews for praise of the characters and plots.
B00002E23E|3.0|To begin with The Song Remains the Same is a must have for any die hard Zeppelin fan as it was their only official live release (well up to 2003) on DVD, and you get to see the band alot & though a bit one sided you do see a side of Zeppelin you probably won't see again & also you see the engulfing figure of Peter Grant which is worth a laugh anyway!!!! <br /> <br />Also the live performances stand up more than they ever did on the album version. For example because of the visuals Dazed & Confused, Moby Dick & Whole Lotta Love are not as tiring as listening on the album. And also there are some added songs Black Dog (though for some reason it's been cut in length) & Heartbreaker, although for some reason Celebration Day (which is on the album) isn't included on the film version!!! <br /> <br />Overall The Song Remains the Same is not an essential Zeppelin DVD now that the 5 1/2 hour DVD is out, but it is worth buying to see what Zeppelin & their management were like back then (the film though released in 1977 is based on the bands Houses of the Holy tour of 1973) & it is also possible to see how the press & public thought of Zeppelin at the height of their popularity!!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|I almost had a heart attack when I saw this album only received four-and-a-half stars by customers.  This album is so good, a thousand stars would not do it justice. <br />On Revolver, the greatest band of all time reaches its apex, which by default makes it the best album ever made.  Though Sgt. Pepper gets all the press, it is its predecessor that features The Beatles crafting soaring pieces of pop music, the likes of which have never been matched. <br />By 1966, it was clear that the band had no real competition; any doubt in that notion was smashed with the release of Rubber Soul the previous year.  As a result, the two greatest songwriters in rock history, Lennon and McCartney, can only continue to compete with each other.  The result is an album so texturally refined, so brilliantly efficient, and so dazzlingly diverse that the sheer sight of the creepy album cover gives me chills. <br />From the man-or-machine countdown leading into \\"Taxman\\" to the spooky honky tonk piano ending \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", Revolver paints a sonic landscape unmatched in rock history.  By now, The Beatles were experimenting with tape loops and sound effects at the same rate that they were experimenting with drugs.  However, instead of overshadowing the brilliance of the songwriters' vision, they somehow make it more clear.  From classical to heavy metal; from a children's songs to a song about the joys of lying in bed; from the most gorgeous love song to the most freaked-out acid song, Revolver has it.  And it's all perfect.  <br />Though adventurous, Revolver is a very accessible album, and accessibility has always been a gift for Paul McCartney.  This album is a creative high for McCartney, the same high that Lennon achieved on Rubber Soul.  After listening to Revolver, even the most die-hard \\"Lennon-is-better-than-Paul\\" people have to look over their shoulders.  \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, and is listed as a favorite of bothJohn and Paul's.  Lyrically, McCartney is matching and even topping Lennon with two of his other masterpieces dealing with lonliness, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"For No One\\".  Add to that the Motown swagger of \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" and the happy-go-lucky \\"Good Day Sunshine\\", and you have a level of mastery that Paul has never been able to match.  This is not, I believe, a discounting of McCartney's later, post-Beatle work, but rather a man who has written songs that cannot be topped, period.  McCartney also contributed the best part of John's \\"Dr. Robert\\", with it's \\"Well, well, well you're feeling fine\\" climax.  And of course, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" hums happily along. <br />Lennon, as usual, is a powerhouse who seems incapable of writing a bad song.  Even his \\"piece of garbage\\" as he described \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" still soars.  As a guitar player for the last 20 years, I still have trouble mastering the guitar lick for that song.  \\"She Said She Said\\" is heavy metal that still manages to be graceful and superbly melodic.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" may be Lennon's best song on the album, and it's a masterpiece of melody weaved together with a lazy, easy beat and Lennon's laconic lyrical delivery.  All these perfectly extol the simple joys of dozing.  Though \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" probably won't be your favorite song if you're a Wings fan, it earns its praise for the relentless one-note charge that it mounts, as Paul and Ringo thump the bass and drums in syncronicity, Lennon reads his freak-out lyrics, and The Birds shriek you to your core.  (Unfortunately, one of the best songs from the Revolver period, \\"Rain\\", was the Lennon B-side to Paul's \\"Paperback Writer\\".  It's the better of the two songs, and is an overlooked Lennon classic.)    <br />Though George Harrison's \\"I Want to Tell You\\" and \\"Love You To\\" are interesting tracks, they don't measure up to the Lennon/McCartney songs.  \\"Taxman\\", on the other hand, points the path that George would take later on, crafting a song so assured (and angry) that it's clear he's been studying John and Paul's songwriting, and he proves he's a capable - if uneven - student. <br />By the end of Revolver, you feel exhausted.  The album covers so much ground and covers it so brilliantly that it seems unlikely that another album can compete.  Nearly every emotion has been shaken and stirred, and you need a drink.  The album gets under your skin as no other does.  Then, you listen to it again.
B000957O82|4.0|Since generally Will Smith is charming, versatile, and generally deserving of his celebrity status, this movie is never intolerable and is enjoyable enough the first time around.<br /><br />The problem arises when you try to watch it again.<br /><br />The main problem is the script, it seems to me, wasn't too well-thought out.  Here the Hitch character was supposed to be so super-smooth with women that bumbling men paid him thousands to give them advice, yet at the same time he was so dorky that, for example, he kicked his girlfriend in the face.<br /><br />The whole thing didn't add up.  It seemed like the filmmakers had two scripts:  one with Will Smith as a loveable dork moving around in the dating scene, and another with Will Smith as a ultra-slick master of the same scene.<br /><br />It seemed like they just combined the two scripts into one movie, hoping no one would notice.  But I did.<br /><br />Some precious quotes, though.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I bought this used, relying on a previous penchant for Vai than any review or recommendation. Man! What a find. This is a great album, from start to finish. And, to boot, it contains the most listenable Via vocals to date. Great production, great playing, great songs. Period. I own every Vai ablum available, and this is as good as any. But what's more is that he manages to take the same guy, the same guitar, the same counter-comercial ideas to new levels. That's quite an achievement. I wish I could meet this man. What a true genius! He's surpassed pettiness and good and evil and such nonsense. It would appear that Mr. Vai is enlightened. He's the Buddha of guitar. To kneel at his feet and receive a lotus flower would be a pilgrimage worth making. Or at least a guitar pick. It takes a special dedication to be able to attain a spiritual connection with a clunky instrument like the guitar. It takes a man who starves himself of personal gratification in order to maintain a connection with the fringe of highest vibrations, the only vibrations we apes can hope to touch, and we're quite lucky to hear his results. Vai is a pioneer, a player who reaches into the darkness and comes back, maybe like Marco Polo or Lewis and Clark, and then translates reliably his interpretation of these ineffable realms. I applaud him and his efforts and am truly grateful to be alive while he's alive. This album restores my faith that there are places, and people willing to be taken to these places, where corporate principles do not yet reign supreme... beautiful places where people are not \\"dying for your loan\\"... or is it love?
B00005JNBQ|1.0|once again MTV \\"films\\" coughs up a complete moronic film that couldnt have been made any worse if the last half hour was just garbled tv snow. i bought this movie the first day it came out. i as alot of other people heard that it was \\"hilariously funny.\\" god once again it shows to me what bile MTV will spit out and people will buy into as funny. ive seen episodes of saved by the bell that were funnier than this, its actually a shame that i bought this movie at full price the day it came out. i was one of those morons that bought into the MTV advertising barrage. i watched this movie and laughed like the first ten minutes (that is a liberal account) and then started to look at my clock to see how much longer this movie was. and after it was finally over i felt as though i had watched a six hour mini series.  <br /> <br />please if this is even a question of buying this or not, do not buy it, at least wait til it is aired on regular tv. you wont miss anything at all.
0380789035|4.0|Im becoming a big fan of Mr. Gaiman,  American Gods is a rollercoaster adventure ride.  I could not put it down.  It is lots of fun, great summer reading book.  I highly recommend it.
B000002JSP|3.0|By the time In through the out Door was released in early 1979, it had been three years since the bands last studio effort Presence (perhaps the bands weakest effort, apart from 1982's b-side album Coda) and with Robert Plant mourning the death of his son, Jimmy Page a heavy heroin addict, & Bonzo on the brink, the album was left mainly for Zep's quiet man bass player John Paul Jones to complete, hence why the album has alot of keyboard solo's, and less Pagey solo's than past Zeppelin efforts, this in a sense is Jonesy's album!!! <br /> <br />Not to say that In through the out door is a bad album. It includes perhaps two of the bands best tracks, In the Evening (perhaps Jimmy Page's last great guitar riff) & All my Love (Robert Plant's moving tribute to his son). If anything no could accuse In through the out door of lacking direction, it has calipso (Fool in the rain) dance (Seaside Saurez, Carouselmbra) & of course rock (In the Evening, I'm gonna Crawl)!!! <br /> <br />Also although both Fool in the rain & Carouselmbra are great songs, they hardly deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as past Zeppelin efforts. Overall In through the out door turns out to be a dissapointing release compared to their past albums, but it certainly isn't their worst & though I'd never recommend it as a starting point I would definitely say if you're a big Zeppelin fan & don't have this you should buy it as it does have some great moments!!!!
0064430170|3.0|The book goodnight moon was my husbands favorite childhood memory of his mother reading to him nightly.  He had memorized all the words and when he was given this book as a kind memory to cherish, the very last page was missing.  He was so disappointed and I was very upset that his surprise was incomplete.
078401213X|5.0|I gotta say that I've had 5 false starts with this film. Each time i tried to watch it, i'd get a headache and turn it off. The film seemed to me pretty intense and i just couldn't deal with it.  <br />Then lately i got around to watching it again and I made a commitment to sit through the whole movie to see if it's really good. It is. No actually it's freaking great! It's a classic in my book. <br />The end of the film makes it all worthwhile...believe me.
B000002H97|5.0|This is my favorite Metallica album.The music is excellent and the sound quality a lot better than any of their previous albums.Every track on this album rocks,from beginning to end.Of course may not be as fast as their 80's albums,but still excellent.They never sold out for me.I also recommend And Justice for All,Load,Ride the Lightning,Master of Puppets and Kill em'All.
B00001ODHL|5.0|i remember the first time i saw this movie (i had never seen the first two) i was immediately a part of the army!  <br />if you have never seen it, this of it as this way, take one part three stooges, one part cheesy exorcist, one part indiana jones, one part any superhero comicbook, this movie will probably never win any type of \\"big budget award, or have major media attention. i think the joy of this movie is that it is seriously a mindless joyride through the mind of a bunch of kids that got together for the love of making movies. they never expected on making an oscar from this, if you know bruce campbell, or sam raimi or rob tapert or any of the other michigan mafia you will know it was all for the fun of it. as you hear from the commentary of this it would almost seem as though this was like a reunion for this bunch of yahoos. bruce campbell is a B Movie genius, he is everymans everyman, he makes you feel like in these movies that YOU can be the superhero of normal everyday life when it isnt so normal. sam raimi is a director's master, when he was making his movies as a kid he was innovating new ideas that no one else had done before. i have never once thought of myself as a connesuer of good film making, or even a good critic, but as an average joe i can tell you if you want to just watch a movie for the joy of watching it then this movie is your huckleberry.......... this movie will always have its perm. place in my shelf! and will always be the top of my list........  <br />besides that how many movies can you say you have quoted using pickup lines such as \\"gimme some sugar baby\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />HAIL TO THE KING BABY!
0894803123|5.0|I purchased this title along with the Kitchen Aid Ice Cream Bowl <br />attachement for my Kitchen Aid Mixer, hoping to get more use out of the mixer.  I read all the concerns about the raw eggs that Ben & Jerry's book recommands, and took to heart that other online reviews suggested to use Egg Beaters instead. Because my husband has just recently (since I've receivced the ice cream maker this very summer) been diagnonised as a diabetic, I have also used Splenda instead of sugar. No difference.  And where Ben & Jerry suggest \\"shaving\\" chocalate, I found I get more out of the bar, if I chop it. <br />Also the biggest thing is....The longer the cream base is refridgated, the easier it sets in the ice cream maker!  And for the cookie dough ice cream, you can use 10 to 12 oz of pre-made dough from a tub (or roll). I used a melon scooper (small end) to form the balls of dough, and then also added a small bag of semi sweet chocolate bits for added taste.  Enjoy!
B000002JSJ|3.0|Whilst their weakest effort (apart from the 1982 b-side release Coda) Presence still has some gems. The ten minute plus epic track Achilles Last Stand & the back to blues song Nobody's Fault but mine. It's also important to remember all the problems the band had making this album, they'd booked the studio (owned by The Rolling Stones) but inbetween recording Robert Plant had a near death car crash & had to record the rest of the album in a wheel chair, and therefore the album was hastily completed!!! <br /> <br />Not to say Presence hasn't got it moments, as mentioned Achilles last stand & Nobody's fault but mine are decent tracks, and For your life is a great rock track, whilst Royal Orleans & Candy Store Rock are great fun, but the album lacks something that previous Zep efforts had...diversity, and invention. Presence doesn't really offer anything new & although the first fine are great the last two songs leave much to be desired & are probably the weakest of the bands carea. This is because Hots on from no where never seems to work, whilst Tea for one seems more like an attempt to do another Since I've been loving you, for the first time in their carea Zeppelin seemed out of ideas!!! <br /> <br />Not to say Presence is a bad album, but it is perhaps the first time that Zeppelin didn't give anything new to their fans. Still if you own the first six Zeppelin albums I'd still suggest you buy this as it has some of Zeppelin's best songs (Achilles last stand & Nobody's fault but mine) but if you're a first time listener then I suggest you start from Zeppelin I and move up the albums before purchasing this!!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I love these episodes, although, I do prefer the later episodes but these seasons are definitley funny and are great for establishing the characters personality traits. For example, George will lie more and explode with rage more and Jerry will become even more of a germaphobe and become even more selfish, etc. as the seasons progress. These episodes are really the classic ones, they have most credit based on that but although the humour is more subtle, I still put these episodes above any other sitcom at the time and many, many that are on now.
B0006L16N8|5.0|What I mean by that is...since Coldplays first two albums were so good, one might come to the conclusion that their third album would fail to live up the the expectations. This album has completely proved otherwise. The lyrics are very inspired and touching, and musically it reminds me of Depeche Mode to some extent. About as close to perfection as it can get these days. <br /> <br />Thats what i love about Coldplay, they're one of the only truly wonderful newer bands of today. Most other bands sell out horribly, Coldplay may be popular but no matter what I dont forsee them selling out, they are true artists.
B000001FTD|5.0|This East Coast headbangers were just amazing.Their Biggest Era was with Joe Belladona.In my opinion,the best Thrash Metal singer ever.Metallica was better,but Anthrax had the best singer.This remains their best album.I also recommend Spreading the Disease,Persistence of Time and Vol.8
B00005JNTX|5.0|Ok, first off, the 5 stars are for the movie. The DVD on the other hand, gets a 0 in my book. I loved this movie. Every second of this movie bled style. From its cool charicters, neat presentaion, super acting, even to corny nior-film like voice overs ad a lot of depth to the people and you know what they are thinking when stuff is happening to them. Its an awsome way of story telling. This is strictly a Guy-movie, the very,very,very bloody action will make some people sick (ex. they show a guy getting a hatchet to the head...yeesh). So, yeah great movie and if all you care about is the movie, get this DVD, but... <br /> <br />This DVD has almost 0 special features to speak of. No commentary, no actor bios, no good featurettes (except for a lame 8 min. short.). This DVD is seriously lacking speicial features. It doesn't even have a Specila features menu, the short is on the main menu. LAME. This movie could have had some cool documentaries on the source material. Too bad. <br /> <br />Movie- 5/5 <br />DVD- 0/5
B0000AQS0F|4.0|When it was first aired I was only able to catch a couple of the episodes.  And  then when they rereleased it for the Sci Fi channel It wasa t a time I was not going to be able to watch.  This way I have it when I want to watch in my time frame.  The commentaries are very good and the gag reels are fun to check out too.  Also it is nice to be able to catch the whole series and understand the dynamics behind what is going on especially with the movie comiing out in september 2005.....
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti, released in 1975, would turn out to amazingly be Zeppelin's sixth straight classic album, with Zeppelin's I, II, II, IV & Houses of the Holy being the others. The best way to describe the album is that it has everything you would associate with Zeppelin, hard rock (The Rover, The Wanton Song, Sick Again), blues (In my time of dying, Black country woman, Boogie with Stu) funk (Custard Pie, Trampled Underfoot) there were even new sounds, the eastern influence (Kashmir, In the light) & dare I say it rock Pop (Houses of the Holy), Physical Graffiti was Zeppelin's tour de force!!! <br /> <br />So in an album, that has basically every form of rock, covered on two sides, there were the usually softer Zeppelin moments too (Ten years Gone, Down by the seaside, Night Flight). In a sense Physical Graffiti perhaps more than any other Zep album (apart from perhaps IV) show cases all of Zeppelin's talents & although not as heavy as Zeppelin's I & II and some may argue that Zep IV makes it point in half the time!!! <br /> <br />But you cannot deny Physical Graffiti's quality, or the fact that Zeppelin were one damn special band, after listening to this I wouldn't be suprised if some people started thinking Zeppelin were the next coming or something. If you want to start on a Zeppelin album, you can't really go wrong on Physical Graffiti. It's weird that the bands sixth & final classic album turns out to be one of their best!!!!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I also saw Celtic Woman on a PBS pledge drive. I was working on the computer and had the tv on behind me and heard the most beautiful voices I've heard in a long time. I stopped what I was doing, flipped around, and was glued to the tv until the show was over. Then I immediately went to Amazon.com and ordered the cd and DVD. Both are fantastic. Unlike others, I have no problems with the audio in Dolby Digital on the DVD version. I had to see these performers live, so I ordered tickets for their show in Peoria, Illinois a few weeks ago. They put on a great concert and sounded incredible. The visuals during the concert were also amazing and had sort of a three dimensional look. I'll be attending another one of their concerts before their US tour ends. I can't get enough of Celtic Woman!
B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho is truely one of the most stylish, sophisticated and sexy films I have ever seen. Rigth from the start to the end, it is one hell of an entertainer. Not only are Dvd Extras very interesting but are very entertaining too. Christain Bale has given his finest performance and I must say, he truely deserved many awards for his role. Please buy this Dvd right now and I am sure, you will be very proud that you did. American Psycho is a stylish fare with alot more to see that guts splashing all over. American Psycho RULES !!!
B00000I07P|5.0|Great album.This was the album that catapulted BJ into fame in the 80's and without a doubt,is their masterpiece.A must have if you like BJ.I also recommend Bon Jovi,New Jersey,These Days and Bounce.
B000005DQR|5.0|1996's Entroducing by DJ Shadow introduced the concept of turntabling as a true artform. This album is constructed ENTIRELY from samples, most drawn from some truly obscure sources, shaped into its own unique and brilliant entity.<br /><br />It kicks off with Best Foot Forward, basically a scratch-heavy intro before going into the brilliant Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt, a moody slow-burning groove that paints images of steady rain out the window of a darkened downtown corner. Truly mesmerizing. The rest of the album offers up nonstop brilliance. Ambient? Jazz? R&B/soul? Hip-hop? Rock? It's all in there, constantly filtered through Shadow's boundless ingenuity and woven into sonic collages that are ample evidence of the fact that truly great composition transcends the boundaries of genre.<br /><br />From a charging funk track (The Numbers Song) to an dark soundscape with lots of twists and turns (Stem/Long Stem), Endtroducing is always engaging. Melancholy, hopeful, intelligent, and witty, occassionally all at the same time. Timeless.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II follows on from the heaviness of their previous LP, but oddly it is far more accessable than the first & if anything is their most commercial release (well as commercial as Zeppelin can get) as many of the tracks don't go over the 5 minute mark. So with 9 tracks to listen to in a 39 minute period is Led Zeppelin II Zeps radio friendly album??? Well if you think it is...you don't know Zep!!!! <br /> <br />The album begins with the US smash single (actually the bands biggest hit single) Whole Lotta Love, a song that borrows lyrics from Willie Nelson, but who cares, it's not like Zep are the first ones to do this & def. not the last. What is & what should never be is the next, it's kinda like those heading banging songs you hear today, but miles better. The Lemon Song is...well weird, just listen for yourself. Whilst Thank You is beautiful, & is Robert Plants tribute to his then wife, & was a sign of things to come on III. Heartbreaker is class, whilst Living loving Maid is pure fun. Ramble on is an accoustic number, but even here Zep sound heavy, whilst Moby Dick has one of the greatest drum solos you'll ever hear & Bring it on home (a cover of a Willie Dixon song) ends the album on a bluesy boogie!!! <br /> <br />To conclude Led Zeppelin II is the easiest & most accessable Zeppelin album. So if you're going to start on a Zeppelin album this is it as it has everything from rock, accoustic, and blues & there are no long solos to contend with (like latter releases) so if you're one of those who just like radio rock & ain't ready for the real thing but want preperation, go and buy Led Zeppelin II, like err...NOW!!!! <br />
0553582461|2.0|Robin Hobb has an unquestionable position at the pinnacle of speculative fiction, having written not the one but the two best fantasy trilogies of the last generation.  And even in the first two books of the Tawny Man trilogy she kept up a quite high standard.  But something happened on the way to the conclusion.  For sure \\"Fool's Fate\\" reads like a Robin Hobb novel.  The dialogue is intelligent, the characters astonishingly real, the world-building careful and solid, and the writing good at a technical level.  At a deeper level, however, Hobb has completely lost sight of what makes a good story.<br /><br />The best I can say for \\"Fool's Fate\\" is that it's a nine-hundred page book which may have a decent three-hundred page book lurking somewhere inside.  We left on in \\"Golden Fool\\" with our heroes anticipating their upcoming quest to slay the dragon Icefyre.  In \\"Fool's Fate\\" they spend one hundred pages at Buckkeep packing and preparing, one hundred pages sailing to the Out Islands, one hundred pages dithering around on an island, and another hundred dithering on a different island.  Four hundred pages gone before the plot is really in motion.<br /><br />We often fear that successful authors simply include anything that comes into their head, and their editors aren't brave enough to hack off unwarranted text.  Sadly that's exactly the case here.  One obvious example: Fitz taking care of Thick.  This consumes well over a hundred pages, with Fitz feeding Thick, dressing Thick, watching Thick be seasick, dragging Thick onto ships, arguing with Thick, fighting with Thick, etc...  This hits the crux of the problem with \\"Fool's Fate\\".  Hobb wants to say things that are true regardless of whether they're interesting.  So yes, of course retarded people were often abused and mistreated in past eras and yes a good person should treated the mentally challenged with respect.  But watching Fitz nursemaid Thick is like reading a novel about paint drying.  Needless to say Thick ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.  But his role is trivially small.  Hobb could have written Thick out of the book entirely, and should have.  Like Jar Jar Binks, he single-handedly turns a decent artwork into a lousy one just by existing.<br /><br />Thick, though, is merely a victim of a larger disease: the dreaded bloat.  Conversations go on ten pages, fifteen pages, or more.  We see events that have no place in the story, visit places we don't need to see, hear the same thoughts repeated over and over.  We get a list of every character's emotions and facial expressions at every paragraph.<br /><br />Even after all this, \\"Fool's Fate\\" might have been redeemed by a good climactic showdown.  But that flops too.  The largest problem with the entire Tawny Man Trilogy is that the villains are so lame.  Laudwine was a paper tiger.  The new villainess in \\"Fool's Fate\\" is a horrendous cliche straight out of a Terry Goodkind novel: evil, laughs maniacally, sex-crazed, tortures people for no particular reason.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"Fool's Fate\\" collapses due to lack of planning and self-control.  Without a goal worth caring about, without progression towards a well-defined conclusion, there's just no reason to keep reading.  Several times I was on the verge of giving up; were this written by any other author, I most likely would have.  We can only hope that Hobb will get back on track with her next project.ck ends up doing something important at the end and thus justifying his presence on the quest.

B00006879E|4.0|This is another CD that I've been wanting for a while, and I finally received it as a gift for Easter.  Needless to say, I've had people tell me that it's better than what they first expected, and I agree that the sound of the album is unique in the way that they fuse so many different styles of music.   <br /> <br />1. Harder To Breathe- A weird way to start the album, seeing as how the sound of this song is somewhat different than the rest.  They come off sounding almost like a half hip-hop outfit, but the song is very catchy.   <br /> <br />2. This Love- Certainly one of their bigger singles, this song takes the mood more into a rock/pop kind of vibe, the melody is neat, although it tends to get a bit overplayed.   <br /> <br />3. Shiver- The guitar at the beginning definately has a bit of an ethnic flavour, and Adam Levine comes off sounding a bit like a boy band singer in this one, but it's a great song anyways.   <br /> <br />4. She Will Be Loved- Certainly more ballad-poppy than a lot of the other songs, I think that the ending on the CD version is great, and a lot better than the radio versions they play around here.  Also the vocals are a lot rawer on the CD.   <br /> <br />5. Tangled- I love the melody, with the minor notes.  It gives it such a haunting sound.  The lyrics are also quite inventive in places.   <br /> <br />6. The Sun- I like this song a lot.  It's very R&B-ish, and very free and loose with the melody.  The chorus is also great.  The guitar bits at the end are quite original, too.   <br /> <br />7. Must Get Out- This could be a single, too.  Very singable, nice melody, and I like the repeated drum part during the chorus near the end.   <br /> <br />8. Sunday Morning- Another R&B-like song, and Adam comes off almost sounding like a young Stevie Wonder during the pre-chorus, which is kind of neat.  Shows off his vocal range nicely.   <br /> <br />9. Secret- This song starts with a minute-long interlude that sounds like something out of Disney's \\"Mulan.\\"  But, unfortunately, that's the best part.  I don't care much for this song, the melody is repetitious and it doesn't have a lot of instrumentation.   <br /> <br />10. Through With You- Another song that infuses minor melodies, and I love the guitar lines throughout.  The ending is also really cool.   <br /> <br />11. Not Coming Home- This track was recoded live, so you can tell that Adam can actually sing quite well, the guitar line is really funky, and it has this neat little echo, as well.  The song is pretty good, too.   <br /> <br />12. Sweetest Goodbye- This is one of the weaker tracks on the album, as it comes out sounding like a boy band again.  I like the chrous though, and at least it has a real guitar solo.   <br /> <br />All in all, it's a good album, and I'm looking forward to their next work!
B00005QEO1|5.0|My favorite Aerosmith album.A must have for every Aerosmith fan.I also recommend Permanent Vacation,Get A Grip,Honkin On Bobo,Aerosmith Greatest Hits(Red album with White logo),Don't Want To Miss A Thing [CD single] and Done with Mirrors.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Before you click on the \\"not helpful\\" button below my review try and understand I gevae this band the benefit of the doubt the whole way. <br />I heard of The White Stripes a while back, people had told me they were amazing and soon to be one of the greatest bands ever, Rolling Stone Magazine even went so far as to place Jack White not to far away from Jimmy Page (a phenomenal guitarist) in their list of the 100 greatest guitarists, I figured that if they recieve this much praise they must be excellent so I went to my friend's house and had him burn me a copy and I took it home, put it in my CD player and prepared for the amazing. <br />I was very disapointed. <br />At first I thought \\"maybe my headphones are messing up or something, maybe it's my CD player?\\" so I changed out both and it still sounded awful, my friend burned me another copy and it still sounded horrific. <br />I've been playing guitar for 18 years and what Jack White does to a guitar is in no way deserving of earning him a place on the top 100 guitarists list, let alone next to Jimmy Page. <br />The drumming is awful, I must say that White's sister is equally untalented and dull as dirt, I've heard better drums come out of a techno drum loop, at least there's some variety on the fourth strike. <br />Overall the music is listless, uninspired, and pretentious dreck that is easily surpassed and has yet to surpass anything except the amazing fact that they have actually been signed to a record deal. <br />They are VERY FAR from being the best band of the 90's, there were alot of great and influential bands in the 90's (Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Pearl Jam, etc.) but the white stripes should NEVER be placed in the same ranking as the brilliant bands I just mentioned. <br />In conclusion this album is like abstract painting, a product of the talentless, sold to and praised by the utterly bewildered.
B000002JSR|2.0|When Led Zeppelin split in 1980 thanks to the untimely death of drummer John Bonham (aka Bonzo) around a year later Jimmy Page went back into the studio and grafted out all the so called remaining Led Zep songs that had been recorded. Some were from as early as 1969, and might have been for Led Zeppelin II (We're gonna groove, Poor) there were also some for Led Zep III (Walters Walk, which is included as an instrumental performance in the bands excellent How the west was Won live album) and the others sessions just after 1979, up to just before the band split (Ozone Baby, Darlene, & Wearing & Tearing). <br /> <br />Although there are some excellent tunes (We're gonna Groove, Darlene & Wearing & Tearing) there are still some questions left unanswered. First why aren't there more songs, why is Hey, hey what can I do (a non-lp b-side to the single Immigrant Song) not on this album. Also there are others that should have been included too such as Baby come on Home. Also although the live version of I can't quit you baby is great couldn't this have been saved for a live release!!! <br /> <br />Overall Coda, released eventually in 1982, is a big dissapointment, considering the bands back catelogue. Though I wouldn't recommend it to first time listeners, I would say if you're a Led Zep fan who has Led Zep albums I-In through the out door then definitely buy this, as it's essential for completists. But if you just want the best of Zep, this certainly isn't it!!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Solid songwriting from the band on their sophomore effort.  Reminds of early U2 with strong rythyms and powerful lyrics like that of the Unforgettable Fire and October.  Band maintains the solid vibe from the first album -
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree started off as Steven Wilson's \\"great lost progressive rock band\\" joke and turned into something entirely more, as Wilson has evolved the band and the music.  One thing I've always said about really great bands, I don't like everything they do.  This is because for me, great bands take chances, and taking chances means sometimes something isn't going to work for a fan.  And in fact, I had all but lost interest in Porcupine Tree before \\"Deadwing\\" came out.  But for some reason, I decided to give the album a chance. <br /> <br />Certainly, that was one of the better ideas I've had recently.    \\"Deadwing\\" is fantastic-- not quite the masterpiece I thought \\"Signify\\" was, but it's awfully good.  The album is a concept of sorts-- Wilson and a partner wrote a screenplay to a movie, loosely a ghost story about self-discovery, and wrote the album about the movie.  This lends a sense of unity to the album that I think has been missing on the past couple Porcupine Tree releases.  It takes the heaviness of \\"In Absentia\\", fuses it with the pop sensibilities of \\"Stupid Dream\\" and the brilliant arrangements and style of \\"Signify\\".  What perhaps is most telling is that several of the songs are really quite long (three stretch around 10 minutes+), but none of them FEEL long-- they're organic and natural and they flow well. <br /> <br />One thing to note about the album though is that it is strong as an album statement and lacks a lot of highlights on a moment-by-moment basis-- certainly guest guitarist Adrian Belew's fierce soloing on the title track and \\"Halo\\" is notable, and \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is pretty clever, well arranged, and features the best synth blast I've heard on record, but really the album itself makes the statement.  The exception to this is \\"Lazarus\\".  Perhaps Wilson's finest moment as a songwriter, it's delicate ballad with a circular piano line, a superb soft vocal, and a sublime slide guitar line.  Really, it stands amongst the best songs I've heard in quite a long time.  And the truth really is that \\"Lazarus\\" alone is worth the price of the album, the fact the rest of it is awfully good is a bonus.  Essential listening for fans and otherwise, check this one out.

006441034X|4.0|I hadn't read any of Diana Wynne Jones' books before I'd watched Miyazaki's take on Howl's Moving Castle.  It seemed that the movie had left out certain plot points leaving it a bit on the confusing side.  So, I picked up the book, curious. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed reading this book.  It is certainly a good book for young adults or readers who enjoy fantasy books such as Brian Jacques' Redwall.  There are many wonderfully created events and experiences that are sure to delight. <br /> <br />More advanced readers will find that it lacks a continuous driving dramatic plot.  There isn't quite the rising action and climax as all excellent fiction has.  It does have a climax, but we don't see it coming till nearly the very end, when it just seems to happen. <br /> <br />The changes in the movie contain a rising action for the plot.  It does increase the danger and excitement in the viewer, whereas the book does not. <br /> <br />Oddly, the book and movie together create something that compliments both and further explains and fleshes out the story and characters.   <br /> <br />Regardless, I'd wholly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy and a good story.
B00000JGHM|3.0|This L.A. crime saga stars Rick Moranis as Neil McCauley, a professional stick em up type who plans one last caper before following the setting sun...presumably with love interest Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer meets Moranis while they are both picketing a West LA Taco Bell for a Save the Chiwawas protest.<br /><br />Eugene Levy plays hard-boiled copper Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, who is obsessed with capturing Moranis and the rest of his gang before they turn downtown LA into a battlefield. The last caper that Moranis hatches involves taking the gang and injecting them with some type of \\"metabolic mass shrinkage serum\\" that he gets from Rob Schneider. Schnieder plays a zany and off-balance research chemist who moonlights as a male escort.<br /><br />After the gang is given the serum and reduced to Barbie and Ken size, they launch into a bank heist that goes pretty wrong. One big problem is that they soon discover that no one in the group can drag the four duffle bags full of money thay have to take away from the stick up. Additional high jinks come about when they arrive back at the full-size getaway car.<br /><br />The downtown, up and down the street shoot-out after the bank heist is particularly noteworthy although you can't tell who the coppers are shooting at. Eventually the cops get bored and clear the area, stepping on two of Moranis's crew in the process....<br /><br />In the final scenes, Levy pursues Moranis into and across a Putt-Putt minature golf course and Moranis is mortally wounded and falls under the windmill on hole number six and collapses.<br /><br />All in all a pretty good crime drama with shrinking bad guys and pretty good timing.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Yea this movie was great, 2 friggin awesome love stories and a great revenge story could ya ask for more? Oh did I mention it's violent, gritty, and down right nasty? If you liked the comics, you'll love the movie, if you like action, you'll like the movie, if you just like seeing people get what they deserve and the not-so-good-guy-but-not-so-bad-guy kick some serious butt, you will like this movie...

B00028HBKM|1.0|almost everyone here would have to agree... fundalmentalist christians, and other neurotic fanatics are PRO-BUSH... and hence PRO-WAR. i see them everywhere, waving their American flags, parading like its the 4th of July everyday, telling me how \\"evil\\" abortion and stem cell research really is, and being just down right snotty and obtrusive. They really should grow up, and PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH.<br /><br />As hard as i may try i cannot see the connection between Jesus Christ and George Bush... I see him making an A@@ out of himself on TV all the time... \\"gods on our side\\" \\"godspeed\\" \\"god bless\\"... its so pathetic.<br /><br />What's worse is the fact that these NEUROTIC christians are backing him up all the way!!! Jesus and WAR!!!??? i just cant see the connection. Are they just trying to be HUMOROUS??? am i missing out on all their sick, twisted humor??? am i missing the fun???!!!<br /><br />Their BELOVED MASOCHIST aka Jesus Christ spoke of TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK... and LOVING ONE's ENEMY... and FORGIVENESS... where's the love in bombing the enemy (foreign countries with \\"supposed\\" connections to \\"terrorist organisations\\")???<br /><br />wheres the love, forgiveness, mercy, pity, compassion in eternally damning those who commit suicide or perform mercy killings??? wheres the forgiveness in locking med clinics??? where's the compassion or mercy in killing doctors who perform abortion???<br /><br />you fundalmentalist, flag bearing, patriotic christians are a hilarity. youre all oblivious to your blatant ANTI-CHRIST natures.
B000000OQY|5.0|\\"Lies\\" ultimately crushed Guns n' Roses popularity with the critics, and do to controversy divided fans down the middle. Nevertheless, this is a very strong, genuine and at times sophisticated album, while also keeping a very hard-edged style of rock on Side One. It is clear from this sophomore release that the Guns wouldn't care what critics think, and go about music in their own manner.<br /><br />Side One opens with a fierce, hard rocking \\"Reckless Life\\" which generally carries a powerful energy through its lyrics and speedy guitar riffs. \\"Nice Boys\\" continues this high paced energy on the album with Rose delivering lightening fast lyrics effectively. \\"Mama Kin\\" is classic live Guns, a proficient cover-song with a very strong guitar riff. \\"Move To The City\\" is a typical GNR live standard, and boasts another model riff and raspy vocal from Axl. Although perhaps \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" displays more rock angst and righteousness, there is no denying that this is GNR rock at its best.<br /><br />Side Two comes across as a very strong-minded, firm approach at passionate music. Although it's criticized for being pretentious, it does feature some beautiful and genuine tunes. \\"Patience\\" is an obvious attempt at widespread popularity, however it is certainly a wonderful song. \\"You're Crazy\\" is without question a superior version in it's slower paced style on this album. Axl also gives a lower pitched and ultimately better vocal. \\"Used To Love Her\\" is a folk rockabilly type song, with the Guns making it as clear as possible that this song is not to be taken seriously. Of course, critics still weren't amused. \\"One In A Million\\" may be the highlight of the album, and the controversial lyrics shattered any chance it had to be considered a great song. The previous reviewer made a clear statement to claim that this song is not an angry call to \\"faggots\\", \\"immigrants\\" and \\"n-ggers\\", but rather an study into the life of a racist. The guitar strumming is astonishing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album from the GNR crew, however the reason I will knock off half a star is because of the length, a mere 34 minutes, and the fact that \\"Lies\\" in my opinion does slightly pale in comparison to \\"Appetite\\" and the Illusions. Still, recommended for GNR fans, and I highly suggest you to try and buy it cheap!> <br />Overall, this is a great album from the GNR crew, however the reason I will knock off half a star is because of the length, a mere 34 minutes, and the fact that \\"Lies\\" in my opinion does slightly pale in comparison to \\"Appetite\\" and the Illusions.

0385338082|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I've recommended this book to many of my girl friends, and they have all loved with as much enthusiasm.  It is a funny, romantic, omg-i-cannot-believe-she-just-did-that kind of book.  One of the greatest way to spend your free time reading this book, and, unlike the plethora of those books that are great but so difficult to get into at first, Can You Keep A Secret pulls you right in at the start.  Emma works as a marketer in a huge company, but actually doesn't know what she's doing...which is refreshing.  You know right off that she's honest and it's so easy to love her.  Anyway--she just failed her first important business meeting and is now faced with her flight back, which turns out even more scary than her failed meeting.  Emma's already terrified of flying, and to make it worse, the plane hits some bad turbulence.  Thinking that she's going to die, she panics and pours out her life story along with all its humiliating bits to the innocent man sitting next to her.  However, they end up making it just fine, and Emma pushes the whole thing out of her mind.  But come Monday, her company gets an unexpected visit from the CEO...which to Emma's horror, turns out to be the exact same guy who was sitting next to her on the plane--the guy that now knows all the intimate, embarrassing details of her life. <br /> <br />And the fun starts there! <br /> <br />Seriously, this is a great read.  Although its shallow and the plot is not that extravagant, Kinsella's story telling ability is marvelous.  Emma has a strong, well-defined voice.  Nothing feels contrived.  She's very frank and candid, admits to giving into luxuries, doesn't like her coworkers, is not perfect (but hell, who is?) and that is what makes her so endearing.  I read a lot of \\"serious\\" books for pleasure too, not just chic-lit, and I still loved this.  Out of all the British chic-lit I've read, this so far has proven to be the best. <br /> <br />(This was the first novel I read by Sophie Kinsella.  I tried reading her shopaholic series afterwards, but I don't think they're nearly as good.  Shopaholic wasn't as funny and...it just didn't do it for me.  Can You Keep A Secret is much better.)
B000025H0Q|5.0|This is a must have album for those who appreciate melodic, folk rock. This album sounds fresh today, even after ~ 25 years. Drake was so far ahead of his time. Incredible.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Forget all of the other Batman movies because this is the definitive one.This has great acting-something the others never had-and a great story and a better director.Tim Burton was good,but didn't get into the backstory of Bruce Wayne and besides,the villans were more colorful and sometimes over the top than should have been.It's a little long towards the end,but still very good.Great action as well...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
0790729652|4.0|I think this one is the second best of all the Batman films. Michael Keaton is the best Batman of all. The only thing I hated was the it was too predictable. Jack Nicholson is a very good Joker. The only person I dislike in this film is Vicki Vale. She needs to learn how to mind her own business. The funniest character is Knox. That is what I think of this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is simply one of the best TV shows I have ever seen. I don't want to sound cliched in my appraisal of the show, its just that there are rarely sci-fi shows that simulaneously finds its voice, gels its characters, and advances an overarcing storyling in just 13 or 14 episodes the way the Joss Whedon's FIREFLY did.  <br /> <br />It took me a while to get over the futuristic/western feel of the series, but once you get used to the setting and the speaking style of the characters (a mishmash of Old Western platitudes and Chinese  slang) Firefly will ensnare you in a way that is not easy to resist, and you won't want to forget or keep the show to yourself.  <br /> <br />This DVD set is gorgeous, and makes it easy to share with non-fans. The success of this DVD set has kept Firefly in production in terms of the upcoming movie SERENITY. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE SUPPORT THE MOVIE!!!  <br /> <br />Do not buy bootlegs! Do not wait til it comes out on DVD, go support it in movie theatres. That is the only way to make sure the series continues in one form or another.  <br /> <br />Browncoats unite!
B000002UB3|4.0|Don't skip tracks...this is meant to be listened to from beginning to end. Something, Come Together, and Here Comes The Sun are great tracks, but you have to hear them here to understand the greatness of this incredible \\"Farewell.\\"

B000002H97|5.0|I dont know whether to give it a 4 or 5 I mean it does have songs like Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Wherever I may Roam, Of Wolf And Man, and Nothing else matters. I mean The Unforgiven is my favorite metallica song of all time. But it also has terrible songs like Dont Tread On Me, My Friend Of Misery and Through The Never But this album has more of an upside then a downside and was what got me into metallica so im gonna have to recommend it to anyone who like metallica and I think the guys in metallica are jerks after that whole napster thing but their old music lives on. Death to St. Anger. If your going to buy a metallica album I recommend over this Master Of Puppets, Ride The Lighning and Kill em all apeals to some while others think its terrible.<br /><br />  ROCK ON and stay true to Metal
B00005JMEW|2.0|Jeez, K.Petri has just shown the World that the stereotype of the dumb uneducated Yank is absolutely correct. No wonder the World is in such a sorry state. Hey Petri, where do you think that guys name comes from? It sure as hell isn't Spanish! Yet as a typical uneducated Yank in your ignorance you can't tell the difference between a Spanish name and an Irish name, and so you slate the entire Spanish people, of whom you know nothing since it is obvious you've never stepped foot outside the US in your pathetic, sheltered, insular life. Probably never even left Texas. You're assessment of the current political climate as it pertains to Iraq/Madrid etc is nothing short of embarrassing and proves that your media and school system really have been dumbing you idiots down for decades now. I agree that Kill Bill was pretty crap. By the way, I'm British and I think Americans that think like you are stupid mindless idiots. Thank God you're not all like that as Cindy Sheehans protest in your own back yard clearly shows.
B000001EEN|2.0|Wow  <br />I was really shocked at the quality of this CD to say the least <br />I'm a moderate Clapton Fan and I've seen him live 4 times but this CD I'm afraid to say is no good
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Much is often mentioned of this film's depiction of drugs and the people addicted to them. To focus one's criticism solely on the negative depiction of drugs in this film is a shallow interpretation of what is ultimately a movie about addiction in all of its forms, even the seemingly 'harmless' addictions of common people. From a TV set, a box of chocolates, the exploration of intimacy between lovers, or the need to be accepted among peers, There's much lurking beneath the surface of this film that is unsettling with regards to human desires, and the lengths to which people go to achieve them.  <br /> <br />What I found most fascinating about this film, was Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of a lonely widow, who after receiving a phone call from a telemarketer promising her an appearance on a television show, becomes slowly obsessed with trying to fit her overweight body into a red dress. What starts as a diet, slowly devolves into a pill popping nightmare, which decays even further into hallucinations and neurosis to the extent that her refrigerator emerges as a monstrous entity slowly preying on her fragile sanity. <br /> <br />Where some found this movie to be disturbing, I found it to be spellbinding. The photography was amazing and the overall film has a meticulously 'crafted' look to it. Darren Aronofsky's inspired use of split screen, clever editing cuts and motion speeds elevate the film visually to the point that your eyes are actually drawn to what at times, can be some fairly repulsive images.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack punched me in the chest the first time I heard it. The central cellos grinding their melody over various ambient sounds, beats and orchestral rhythms was truly unique. Since this film's release, i have heard its soundtrack used on trailers for other movies (most notably, 'LOTR: The Return of the King' TV spots). <br /> <br />I would never say that this film is for everyone. It seems like a movie people tend to either love or hate. I'd be amazedto find anyone 'riding the fence' in their opinion of this movie. I'm obviously one who loves this movie. I was completely amazed by the look, sound and feel of this film. Ellen Burstyn gave the performance of her life in this film, which is really just one bullet point on a movie which i found to be brilliant in numerous ways, from start to finish.
B00006IU73|5.0|This was my first Porcupine Tree cd and I was blown away. I've bought 5 other PT cd's since. I really love this band and (in my opinion) this cd is really their best work. <br />DeadWing and Warszawa are also really great.
0060723513|3.0|To understand the genre of this book's concept, think Carlos Castaneda and his mysti-speak Yaqui yarns. Since I am part Native American (Cherokee), married to a Samoan over 40 years, having lived and traveled among relatively \\"uncivilized\\" peoples for many years, I understand how an idealistic non-Aborigine could have thought that to spin this story would be a good idea. But native peoples themselves tend to understand their world quite differently from how overconfident outsiders think they do. Thus much of even Margaret Mead's professional anthropological study, Coming of Age in Samoa (most of which was not fiction as is Morgan's novel), caused both ire and mirth among Samoans, who recognized that various of Mead's case studies were spun, and others were based on Samoans' playing straight-faced jokes on her that she didn't catch onto before publication. <br /> <br />I sympathize and resonate with Morgan's intent of giving voice to Aborigine views and sentiments that we need in our increasingly technologically polluted world, but she got so much wrong that Aboriginal elders became incensed enough to make a transoceanic journey in order to protest a proposed film to be made from the book, and extracted an apology from Morgan regarding her untruthful and/or simply ignorant claims. <br /> <br />The book is interesting and readable despite Morgan's weaknesses as a writer, and one of my sons, a bonified lizard lover who has lived barefoot in that part of the world, loves it. If you read it, think of it as allegorical and colorful, like a brightly painted hippy bus of the 60s, and be open to its \\"spiritual\\" thought content, but don't mistakenly think of it as being an account of actual experiences. Again, think Carlos Castaneda with his wacky Yaqui sorcerer guide.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|This movie without doubt is the worst movie ever put on DVD. The story line is all over the place. The actors were really not suited to their roles. Some of them need acting lessons. Jane Austen must be rolling over in her grave over this production.

Anyway, that's all I have to say.

0156027321|4.0|This is what true story telling should really be about! What an accomplished plot, full of humourous twists and unusual turns. It has aspects of Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, RK Narayan's A Tiger for Malgudi and (if I may say so) Moacyr Scliar's Max and the Cats. It attracts the reader through its voyeurism and fantasy. Truly international... <br /> <br />No spoilers here, this book is a must read.

0679735909|4.0|Forget the 2002 Gwenneth Paltrow flick, this is a much better story. In the 1980's, an American researcher uncovers a previously unguessed-at link between a major Victorian poet and one of that era's first feminist writers. Unraveling a century-old thread that leads from manor houses to libraries to mouldering Victorian crypts and literal graverobbing, a secret love affair is uncovered that opens a doorway into a hidden past, and reveals a chapter in the lives of two 19th-century icons that no one suspected was there.<br /><br />Pay close attention to those last few pages set in the past: they are poignant.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi was the first true page-turner I have read in months.  Pi's informative and amusing essays on animal behavior, his search for meaningful connections between the Hindu, Muslim, and Christian faiths, and the unusual survival story all drew me in more than I expected.  Part of the appeal is the disarming tone the author adopts: Pi has a unique and likeable voice that makes you root for him more than the average Jack London survivalist.  I also really enjoyed the brief foray into science fiction, though I am sure that section turned some readers off. <br /> <br />I would only warn readers that the book does not explore religion and philosophy as deeply as the back-matter may lead you to believe: at least, that was so in my case.   <br /> <br />However, I enjoyed an unusual piece of survival fiction, with excellent twists and a thought-provoking (if somewhat overdone now) ending.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|They got it! Other than BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES no other Batman movie or TV show has ever \\"got\\" Batman. I'm a big Batman fanatic, been reading and collecting Batman comics for over 25 years, have a room full of Batman related merchandise (nothing from the movies though) and I had given up hope of there ever being a good non-animated Batman film. I hated BATMAN & ROBIN but who didn't? I also absolutely HATE Tim Burton's Batman films. Burton did what HIS version of Batman would be not THE Batman that has been around 60 plus years.<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS is Batman, Bale captured the rage that hides behind Bruce Wayne's harmless facade. The filmakers understand that Batman IS the man, Bruce Wayne is the mask. This is a man on the edge, a grown man still traumatized by his parents murder, he s full of rage at the world that allowed it to happen but he is NOT insane as some seem to think. The fact that he still believes that the world in general and Gotham City in particular is what helps him hold onto his sanity.<br /><br />The movie is dark, visually and thematically as it should be. It is also grounded in reality, all the tools and villians are plausible in a real world (the car is one low point, it would have been a cool vehicle in another movie, maybe a Bond film but it didn't feel like a BATMOBILE). I cannot reccomend this enough Batman as he should be portrayed. If you like it check out the only other good Batman films the animated: MASK OF THE PHANTASM and SUB-ZERO.
B000AA4LAK|3.0|This re-release could have been so much better, it could have included lots more bsides on than it has,the why dont you find out for youself cover, who let you go, the many remixes of mr brightside and somebody told me, show you how and the super rare waiting for love, which could have been a massive double disc release. <br /> <br />That would have made it truly special, but this is a re-release of the japanese released album, which isnt even as good as the japanese release, as that was released with the 3 bonus tracks and with a seperate dvd with 3 video's of the singles! <br /> <br />Superb album though, anyone who doesnt own it already ...well just go buy it and see what your missing.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've read quite a few reviews on this DVD, and for the most part people are getting it right.  Therefore I'm not going to comment on how amazing Page's guitar playing is since every review seems to comment on that.   <br /> <br />What caught my attention was how unappreciated Bonahm's drumming is.  Bonahm is one of, if not THE greatest rock drummer of all time.  Page and Plant have said many a time that Zeppelin would not have been as good without him.  <br /> <br />One reviewer even stated:  \\"Still, I think it was his intelligence and tastefulness that made him great, not his strokes which are for the most part easily duplicated.\\" <br />Easily duplicated?  Ask any serious drummer and they'll tell you just how hard his rythyms and fills are to maintain.  He also uses his left foot on the high hat better than any drummer i've ever heard or seen.  A perfect example of his drumming genius can be seen on the song \\"Moby Dick.\\"  His drum solo lasts for about 30 minutes, which is downright ridiculous.   <br /> <br />I don't want to rant and rant about Bonahm's drumming, but I just want to make it clear that Bonahm was a vital part to Zep's success.  His rythyms are unique and impressive and deserve more credit then that of a mediocre drummer.
0767812387|4.0|This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!!  It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!!

0380789035|5.0|The gods are born by the human decision to worship them, live as long as they are remembered, and die if they are forgotten: The idea is at least as old as Richard Garnett's \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" short story. So what happens to gods when they become casual memories, no longer worshipped but lingering at the edge of consciousness?<br /><br />Gaiman would suggest that Odin is the oldest American god who has not passed entirely from our memory, having arrived with the first Viking visitors (unless Gaiman is doing a bit more with prehistory and that mammoth skull than I caught in one reading; I *think* that god is dead). He's also going to let us know {warning: very slight spoiler} that the American Odin is not the same as the Scandanavian one, though they were once the same (new conceptions of the gods become, in effect, new and separate gods).<br /><br />So we know the old gods, Odin and all the rest of those folks from a variety of traditions. And we meet a few of the new gods, like the TV set and the 'net and 'Media' and maybe Elvis (a fun touch: do we meet Elvis or not? Gaiman does mention his name).<br /><br />The plot? Oh, these gods are going to have a war, and our protagonist is going to find himself in the middle of it. That, and a subplot or two, serves to hold our interest as Gaiman invites us to join in his cynical reflection on American values: What are our gods? Do we have any who are worth our thoughts, let alone our worship?<br /><br />On the surface it's a good story, an intriguing fantasy piece with a cynical message. It also has a bit of depth -- the protagonist is named 'Shadow' with good reason, and more shadows than him lurk in the background of this book.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Roger Ebert's original review of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" predicted that once the circumstances of the nightmarish shoot were forgotten, and once the debate over Marlon Brando's million dollar salary died down, all that would be left was one of the most powerful, vivid movies ever made.  That was before Francis Ford Coppola and Walter Murch finally remade the movie more than two decades later. <br /> <br />\\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\\" has been released, giving viewers more insight into just what happened in the Philippines.  And Jim Carrey made a reported 20 million dollars to make \\"The Cable Guy\\", for which we will never see a Redux.  So, with controversy out of the way, is Ebert right? <br /> <br />I believe the extra 49 minutes of footage are carefully and organically sewn into \\"Apocalypse Now -- Redux\\".  If anything, they make the movie more coherent.  They turn Coppola's disjointed nightmare into a fever dream that makes sense.  While some moments in \\"Redux\\" have drawn criticism, I found that each had some merit in fleshing out the theatrical release. <br /> <br />\\"Redux\\" adds one final episode before Captain Willard reaches Kurtz's compound: the visit to a French plantation that appears out of the fog.  I read somewhere that Coppola considered the French characters to be ghosts.  This makes perfect sense.  There are nearly identical shots of the boat before and after this scene; one could imagine that it never really happened, apart from in Willard's fevered imagination, or Lance's acid-tinged haze. <br /> <br />Dialogue in that scene compares the Vietnam War to \\"the biggest nothing in history\\", a point that hearkens back nicely to \\"Heart of Darkness\\".  The plantation owner's chart of the number of attacks he defended against -- from Vietnam North and South, and from the Americans -- grounds the scene deeply in the illogic of war.  Did John \\"Red Dawn\\" Milius really write that sequence? <br /> <br />As for the extended Playmates sequence... say what you will about the disconcerting tryst between Frederic Forrest and the bird-loving Miss December (Miss May!), but you can point a finger at Sam Bottoms and say this is exactly the scene where Lance loses touch with reality; his fixation with camouflage paint begins here, and he hardly utters a word for the rest of the film.  This adds texture to his mute surrender to Kurtz's children. <br /> <br />By the time Marlon Brando appears, the movie has already made its point countless times over: in the number of soldiers who don't know who's in charge; in Albert Hall's eyes, after the expressively rigid boat chief is surprised to find that he's dead; in Robert Duvall's comic lament to his stolen surfboard (\\"You know how hard it is to find a board you like\\"); in the realization that the U.S. Army has \\"liberated\\" villages from merely a phantom menace that never really appears in the film.  If the film had concluded without Willard ever finding Kurtz, this movie would still have made its mark as one of the great movies about war and its effect on human nature.
B0007M22TI|1.0|After watching this DVD several times, I am disgusted at how pre-recorded this concert really was.  These women don't even sing on this DVD, they lip synch more than any other artist that I've seen. Even Britney Spears attempts at least ONE live song, as horrible as it may sound. <br /> <br />These women take the marketable Celtic concept and deliver a DVD that rips off customers.  Yes, the music is beautiful and ethereal; no dispute there.  But if you're going to put on a concert, sing the songs live to your audience.  I hope these women can really sing in the first place and were just suffering from acid reflux. <br /> <br />I give this DVD one star because of the money I paid for being ripped off with lip-synched vocals and pre-recorded performances.  These \\"Celtic\\" women should be ashamed of themselves.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I saw something similar to this on Saturday Night Live a few months ago with Ashley Simpson.
B00005V0X5|4.0|megadeth's first album, killing is my business and business is good is a perfect example of pure thrash goodness. it starts off with the eery piano tune, played by dave himself, on last rites/loved to deth. its one of the lower songs on my list but the following song, the title track, is makes up for everything. a great song, one of my favorite megadeth tunes along with the following one. the skull beneath the skin is accually about the bands... mascot, vic,(shown on the cover of the album) rattlehead is a good mosh-pit song which is where the title of this crappy review came from. the next three tracks, chosen ones, looking down the cross and mechanix(the original version of metallica's four horseman) are all fairly good songs, ldtc being my favorite out of the three. but now we come to these boots. what the hell? ive heard the original version, well megadeth's original version, and i cant believe hazlewood, the writer of the original song, made dave change it. all the beeps completly ruin it. i cant believe it was that big of a deal to him. it closes the album on a lower note but if youve heard the original, its no big deal. the demos are from 1984 and are of very poor quality. i dont have the original version of this cd, before it was remastered, but if the demos are examples of what it sounded like before being remastered, im almost glad i never got it. but anyway, the demos dont add much to the album. the ruined version of boots and the fact that this album is a little short, are the only donwsides. so if your a megadeth fan you obviosly need to get this, dont start with it but get it. if you call yourself a fan of thrash and dont have this, im ashamed of you.  <br /> <br />PS, what the hell is the PA sticker all about? the only reason i could think of that it would be there is because of the cover, which by the way, is unbelievably awesome.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have long followed rock music and feel that Green Day has produced a strong contender for the greatest rock album of all time.  In my mind, it is the greatest.  Concept albums are ambitious undertakings, held together by simple stories and mostly with little meaning or message to glean from.  Green Day has come up with a concept album, a punk rock opera, that has powerful political and cultural relevance, beautiful yet profound lyrics, terrific style with breakout songs ranging from powerful ballads like \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" to hard rock classics like \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Holiday\\" and two nine-minute mini-masterpieces composed of five different parts each. <br /> <br />What Green Day has done so brilliantly is to tackle the ever-present state of apathy and the erosion of our essential freedoms by conservatism and the \\"redneck agenda\\".  They relay these messages through the eyes of a young disaffected youth, the Jesus of Suburbia, who experiences a sudden awakening and challenges the spoon-fed morals and values tossed at him by politicians and the media.  He struggles with rage and love, encountering strong personalities along the way in the suicidial and nihilistic St. Jimmy (who could be his alter ego or even a figment of his imagination) and the righteous independent girl Whatshername.  The album doesn't settle for a predictable and expected happy ending but leaves it open-ended and reflective, just as life often is. <br /> <br />The brilliantly conceived lyrics are both poetic and illusory, allowing for much speculation and interpretation.  Nothing is completely obvious or pedantic.  And yet beneath it all lie powerful messages about apathy, homophobia, censorship, the media, materialism, religion and war.   <br /> <br />Billie Joe Armstrong's great sense of catchy hooks combined with the phenomenally powerful and propulsive drumming of Tre Cool and the perfectly matched basslines, like a deep and low heartbeat, fromthe equally talented Mike Dirnt work so well on the potent rock anthems and ballads.  There's not a better trio in rock today. <br /> <br />Green Day doesn't limit their style to one form of music but instead explores punk, rock and musicals.  Their influences include the Rolling Stones, Motown, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Clash and the Sex Pistols as well as the musicals The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Grease and Jesus Christ Superstar.   <br /> <br />Any lover of rock music must appreciate Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming.  Each song is basically composed of five different tunes, each one unique and blending into the next.  It is amazing to pull off a song like this once.  But they did it twice in the same album. <br /> <br />All the musical transitions work well in bridging the songs and keeping the story going.  And there are innovative uses of the glockenspiel, church bells and bongos. <br /> <br />Even the artwork has a power and beauty, a symbolic fist grabbing a heart in the shape of a hand grenade, representing the struggle between rage and love. <br /> <br />This great great album has a cross-generational appeal that spans from young children to those in their fifties.  It has won over so many fans who never sampled Green Day before.  Bravo bravo bravo to Green Day.  I do not envy them having to follow up on this masterpiece.
0792164903|5.0|Boy, do I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. This movie really is like no other! Only Johnny and Tim can make a movie that frightens, but is also funny!  <br /> <br />This movie is so creepy and dark and eerie, it might as well be in black and white...but that's Burton's trademark. Ichabod Crane (Depp) is sent to the gloomy ghost-like town of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate murders. But not just murders, decapitations! This is the tale of the Headless Horseman, played by Christopher Walkin, who is perfectly terrifying. He is hideous...his teeth are filed sharp and his eyes are transparent!! (Do not let little children see this movie.) As Ichabod gathers various clues to solve the mystery of this monstrous killer, he meets and falls for the mysterious and witchy Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) who is strangely connected to all the murders...and slowly the legend of the Headless Horseman begins to unravel. <br /> <br />The best thing about this movie is Depp's acting as Ichabod. Ichabod's character is so comical! He investigates murders, but yet he behaves like a little girl, squeamish and terrified of everything...even spiders! I can't help but laugh hysterically when he is in bed with the covers pulled up around his face and he says, \\"I saw him...It was a horseman...HEADLESS!\\" And he keeps repeating that until he passes out from sheer fright. This movie is another example that proves Johnny's acting is unparalleled.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't call this a horror movie, but it is scary, it is gory (there are a lot of bloody decapitations...just so you know), it is creepy, it is dark, and above all, it is a masterpiece.
B00009V7T2|5.0|It's all been said before - fantastic album, just phenomenal.  I haven't been able to listen to anything but this album since I got it a month ago.  Just listen.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|This movie rocked. Although Uma was stunt doubled, I still liked the theme of an american blond-haired chick taking on the samurai persona. This was defintely the better of the two movies, mostly because this lead to a lot of action at the end... (you could tell it was building to that). Unlike Vol.2 where &quot;story&quot; had to be the most important thing... Puh. Story? Since when is that a concern?? :-P
0571202284|5.0|Okay so I read lots of reviews before I buy anything seldom do I come back and review them but I felt compelled to do it for this book. I'm an animation student and I have to say that I can't believe I took so long to buy this book. If you only ever buy one animation (if you're an animator and you only buy one book on the subject there's something horribly wrong) BUY THIS BOOK. This book speaks in a language visual people can understand. My favourite thing about the book is that near the end Richard abandons typed text and everything becomes handwritten notes clustered around drawings. It's really a beautiful book it makes you want to run over to your lightbox or whatever your preffered media is (mine is clay, but this book makes you appreciate drawn animators alot) and animate. I read it whenever I'm feeling uninspired it reminds me why I'm studying this beautiful artform. Buy now. Or at least add it to your wishlist so even if you have no money of your own (like me) someone might buy it for you (like me - thanks dad). Oh as some other reviews say this is a character animation book but if you're doing anykind of animation you should give it character traits emotions etc unless you're doing flying logos and spaceships (flying logos can benifit from some character too I'm sure, if you're being paid to animate you should have at least read this book in the library preferably you should own it). Anyway must get back to work now. Procrastination, like motion capture, is the devil.
B0000640S1|5.0|The first being Rocky, this film is really good. For an action film, it really has depth in its characters. Stallone is a very underrated actor and this is one his best roles. He plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, who has not really adjusted to society after the war and snaps after being arrested for no reason at all. Brian Dennehy is great as the town sheriff who has a real mean streek to him. Richard Crenna is great as the colonel who trained Rambo who must help him before its too late. The screenplay cowritten by Stallone has some great moments including the radio conversation between Rambo and Trautman (Crenna). Also has a really documentary on making of the film. Too bad the sequel, like the Rocky ones, weren't as good. Highly Recommended.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This album is probably the most refreshing album I've heard in a very long time. The tracks are as follows. Even a true Pearl Jam fan wouldn't give this album just 1 star. <br /> <br />Turn Up The Sun - a great melodic song that makes you wanna sing along. Classic Oasis <br /> <br />Mucky Fingers - A great song to stomp your foot too. <br /> <br />Lyla - The first single off the album, one of oasis' best songs. <br /> <br />Love Like a Bomb - Perhaps one of Liam's best tunes. <br /> <br />The Importance of Being Idle - The 2nd single off this album, very reminiscent of the 60's. <br /> <br />The Meaning of Soul - Very upbeat, faster song.  <br /> <br />Guess God Thinks I'm Abel - A slower more emotional song. Very creative guitar riffs and melodic transitions. <br /> <br />Part of the Queue - One of my personal favourites. I like it because this song is in 5/4 time. Not many artists do that anymore. <br /> <br />Keep The Dream Alive - A straight forward rock n roll song. very catchy melodies. <br /> <br />A Bell Will Ring - Another straight forward rock n roll song. Reminds me of Heathen Chemistry. <br /> <br />Let There Be Love - Possibly the \\"Let it be\\" of our time. An instant classic. <br /> <br />I recommend to anyone to pick up this album. Don't believe the \\"truth\\" of whatever a close minded pearl jam fan thinks.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|This dvd is cool, I love the subtiles there way funner than the voice overs. The movie is one of the best movies ever made, its one of those movies that you can see over and over again with out being bored. The only thing I thoght the dvd was short of was the deleted senes. On the dvds back it say deleted senes but there are only 2! But disspite the 2 deleted senes it was a 5 star dvd!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn is one of the greatest artist of our time and this is one of the best soul albums ever!  <br />Basically every single song is top-notch and enjoyable. The lyrics are on point. The production is brilliant. The rapping and vocals are great, the arrangements and composition is wonderful. Buy this wonderful classic today.
B000001GQB|5.0|Karl Bohm's famous recording of Mozart's late symphonies is one of my favorite Mozart recordings.  These were recorded with the Berlin Philharmonic in the early 1960s, when Bohm (1894-1981)had the maturity of years as an opera and orchestra conductor, and applied them in the then new age of stereo to Mozart's symphonies, previously recorded by Bruno Walter, Thomas Beecham, and George Szell.   Bohm believed in the use of a large orchestra to play Mozart, to the benefit of the music.  There is delicacy and grace when needed, yet great power in dramatic moments which does not distract from Mozart's message. The Berlin Philharmonic strings are especially beautiful, and the recorded sound is very good: rich and full in all registers. What a contrast to the many chamber orchestra recordings of Mozart's Symphonies today, which sound puny and undernourished by comparison. <br /> <br />Karl Bohm later recorded Symphonies 35, 38, 39, 40, and 41 with the VIENNA PHILHARMONIC in the late 1970s nearer the end of his life.  These were not as successful as the Berlin set, yet there were some beautiful moments.  The Berlin Philharmonic recordings have better sound and are better played. <br /> <br />If you are interested in Mozart's Complete symphonies (of which this 2 disc ORIGINALS set in a part), DG also has Bohm's Berlin set (10 CDs) available via Amazon.com.  It is a larger investment, but well worth it.  I give these recordings the highest recommendation.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce is a great entertainer and performer, and too her credit also a songwriter and producer, how great she is at the latter can be discussed. The lyrics really lack depth and substance, but other than that the album holds a pretty high quality musically. Some of the songs can take awhile to grow on you, and aren't really as hit-worthy as her singles. Still good noneless.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|from one of the most talented and potential artists around. It delivers some killer old-school rnb and soul music. Stand-out tracks are the single \\"You don't know my name, If I ain't got you, Karma, her rendition of If I was your woman/walk on by, the great When you really love someone, Wake up, the catchy Samsonite man, the innovative \\"Heartburn\\". <br />I think she's somewhat lacking in the lyric department, but other than that a solid album. <br />
B0009Y33H4|4.0|QUITE BRUTAL AND RAW CD, NOT FOR VAN DER GRAAF STARTERS.<br /><br />WONDERFUL NEVER THE LESS, IT HAS BEAUTIFUL PASSION IN ITS AGRESSIVENESS AND HONEST APPROACH.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE NEW TO VAN DER GRAAF, BEGIN WITH LIZARD PLAY,THEIR MOST ACCESIBLE, AND GO ON WITH STILL LIFE, GODBLUFF, HE TO HE AND FINALLY THEIR MASTERPIECE PAWNHEARTS.<br /><br />GREAT REMASTERING
B00005A1PR|4.0|from a talented young lady. This is one of the best soul albums of the last few years. Her voice is really smoothing and she's a good lyricist. It's a great feel-good record, she seems like such a positive and sweet girl. Everytime I'm feeling down this is one of the best albums to put on to make me will better. \\"Video\\", \\"Strenght, courage and Wisdom\\", and the others always put a smile on my face. Another really well-made song is \\"Ready for love\\". The cd has it highs and lows,but overall it's a made-well album.  <br />

1881273628|5.0|This book was initially recommended to my husband and me by a family member and then later in a religious class before getting married.  The author recommended logical techniques to improve communication and affection between you and your partner.  The book engaged my husband enough for him to take the material seriously and follow through with trying the techniques.  We both agree that couples could save money down the road by reading this book before seeking counseling.  We have now given this book as gifts to other friends engaged to be married.
B000062YAZ|5.0|THIS IS PERFECT THRASH ALBUM THAT YOU WILL BE HOOKED ON LISTEINING TO. SONGS LIKE \\"ANGEL OF DEATH\\" \\"PEICE BY PEICE\\" \\"ALTER OF SACRIFICE\\" AND THE METAL CLASSIC \\"RAINNIG BLOOD\\" DELIVERS INMENSE BRUTALLITY TO METAL HEADS EVERYWHERE.BUY THIS.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I agree with some comments that Robin Williams went a little over the top in this otherwise well-meaning and sweet film. The message of the film is much stronger than the messenger though, and I found it to be a very humane and inspiring vehicle for Williams' talents.  <br />A very fine supporting cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Patch's prig of a roommate, Monica Potter as his skeptical (at first) love interest and especially, the fellow who plays Truman (the tall, lanky fellow with the glasses) provided comic relief (to Robin Williams! Quite a feat!).  <br />The children in the film were all real patients, and they added a sense of realism and urgency to the film's deep and abiding message of compassion. <br />This collector's edition has many bonus features. The one I loved the most was Shadyac's commentary. You can see that he was on a mission with this film, and you also learn a lot about his influences. He is as funny as Robin Williams, and maybe even as crazy!
B0006HXXBA|5.0|KREATOR IS ONE OF THE GREATEST METAL BANDS EVER. I WAS HOOKED WHEN LISTEINED TO THIS ALBUM. THE GUITAR IS GREAT. THE VOCALS DONE BY MILLE PETROZZA IS FANTASTIC. AND WHATS REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THAT MICHAEL AMMOT(FROM ARCH ENEMY AND CARCASS) APPEARS ON THE SECOND SOLO OF \\"MURDER FANTASIES\\". THE SONG THAT YOU MUST HERE IS \\"VOICES OF THE DEAD\\" WHICH IS F##KING AWSOME. PICK THIS UP NOW!!!!!!!!!
B000068TPN|5.0|Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace go together very well. Their collaberation for Braveheart was phenominal.  <br /> <br />The film is brutal and violent, however it is toned down compared to Saving Private Ryan.  <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is a good war film, containing everything a good movie should, with a good message, and a patriotic feel. <br /> <br />We Were Soldiers is the best Vietnam movie, even better than Platoon, and that is saying a lot.
B000002H6C|5.0|I REMEMBER HEARING ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS IN THE SEVENTH GRADE AND THATS THE SONG THAT GOT ME INTO METALLICA. THIS ALBUM IS EXTREAMLY HEAVY AND BONECRUSHING.

0060751967|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read it practically nonstop. I won't discuss plot lines as they have been listed before.  Let me tell you what I liked about How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire.  Ms. Sparks has created a whole vampire world--sort of along the lines of Harry Potter and the whole wizarding world.  There is a whole hierarchy and sort of a parallel universe existing right alongside the human one--of course, the humans have had their memories wiped clean, so we don't know about all the vampire stuff.  But, once you read this book, you will know and you will love it.  Shanna is a wonderful heroine, not too spunky and never TSTL.  She has problems in her life and she is going to handle them.  She comes under the protection of what has to be one of the best heroes ever written.  Roman Draganesti is to die for(Ha! Ha!).  He has all kinds of torment and pain and it is great. Watching these two get together had me laughing out loud.  But, there is a depth to Spark's writing.  Roman's background and his abhorence of what he has done were riveting.  I loved reading how he, with Shanna's help, realizes that he is not beyond redemption.  It took this book to a whole new level.  I have read many, many vampire books.  Unfortunately, they ultimately proved unsatisfying.  Not this one.  I can't wait for the next one.  With the cast of characters in this book, (Angus, Laszlo, Gregori, Jean-Luc, Connor, and Ian, to mention a few) Ms. Sparks can keep writing for years.  I am waiting for more on my all-time favorites--kilt wearing, Scottish vampires.  Can there be anything better??
B0009S2T0M|5.0|For those of you worrying that this is an edited version due to the difference in running time, STOP WORRYING. <br /> <br />This is indeed the original, uncut version of the film.  The difference in total running time comes from the conversion from PAL to the U.S. NTSC format.  The Oldboy DVD here is a PAL version because PAL runs at 25 frames/second while NTSC is at 29.  Hence you lose 4 frames/second leaving you with the total time difference. <br /> <br />Also if that is not enough for you, I know people who have viewed this DVD and said nothing was cut so rest assure you are getting the complete film. <br /> <br />Now for the DVD: The movie is easily 5 stars.  The DVD I would give 4 stars.  In Korea, they have two editions, a regular 2 disc one and a mega 4 disc set.  You can imagine the features we are missing out on.  I have the Korean 2 disc set (not Region 1), and I'm getting this so I can play it on my region 1 DVD player.  There could be more features and Tartan has been known to issue two different sets (one regular, the other deluxe).  Regardless, if you're not a stickler about features get this version.  It is uncut, has a few good features, and is in 5.1 DTS sound.  The film is easily one of the best I've seen in the last five years.  Get it.

B0000047CX|5.0|This is the beginning of bossa nova in jazz. Historically an important monument, this is a must-have for your collection. The music is ideal background music, with the laidback Brazilian rhythms, the relaxed singing of Astrud Gilberto and the sweet playing of Stan Getz.

B000AARKOO|5.0|I truly enjoyed watching this movie and was inspired to read more about the history of the crusades.  <br />For history fans, no, the movie is not a 100% accurate but I would say about 80%. Keep in mind that this is not a documentary, it is a hollywood movie and therefore should be judged based on the entertainment level and not the accuracy of its historical story.  <br />If you are inspired to learn more about the crusades and read about the characters in the movie, I recommend the book \\"Warriors of God\\" from James Reston Jr.  <br />Enjoy and have fun!!! <br />
B000002KBH|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album they did...Working man is really good though ...and though I am a Dead newby with only 23 shows under my belt...I feel qualified to review the Dead and I feel my review may be the only one you will need since I mainly got into the dead because of Greg Ginn. I'll never forget Anaheim with Dylan and all the Long Beach Arena shows and whatnot...oh how I got drunk and danced to those shows...Lots of happy guys n gals hugging and though I had no gal , I had my Dead...this album has it all; Box of Rain, Friend of the Devil, etc...ITS A CLASSIC , I'm sick of Truckin...but everytime I hear it, I listen nonetheless..Attics of my life ..a beautful song and ofcourse there is the awesome Sugar Magnolia,...I am one of the rare people who thinks Dead studio albums are all really good...and I don't mean \\"in the Dark'....The shows at the Forum were awesome...I got close enough to almost grab the drums sticks and rock with Mickey Hart ...but I just didn't quite have the courage...nor the talent ; BUY THIS ALBUM...AND TELL A FRIEND...AND CHECK OUT THEIR STUFF ON PBS RIGHT NOW TOO...SHOWS FROM WINTERLAND IN THE 70'S...ITS EXCELLENT. --CLARK HAGINS.
B0000942HV|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Mike Olfield's epic albums (TB1, Hergest Ridge, and Ommadawn pt.1), less fond of Incantations (80 minutes of recording containing about 30 minutes of music) and care nothing for his subsequent works. It seems that whenever he \\"revisits\\" old recordings, he feels the need to change and rework. First there was the <terrible> remix of Hergest Ridge for the CD release, which he has vehemently stood by as <the> version. (I keep an mp3 version of the analog version - even with the supresssed dynamic range of the analog medium, it's a far superior mix.) Then came TB2, which was flat and uninspired. Now there's TB3. I've read about this 'note-for-note' re-make, a 'bar-for-bar' polish and modernization of the old classic.     Objectively, it's not 'note-for-note', there being noticeable differences in mix, instruments, and, well, NOTES. More clever string bends and key trills than the original.     Subjectively, there's almost a sense of mockery of the original material. The bends and trills I mentioned before have an air of superiority, like someone trying to 'out-virtuoso' the original artist. I have read that TB2 was almost a playful put-down, a gentle ribbing of TB1's seriousness. TB3 certainly sounds like it.

B000007SPT|1.0|If you're looking to recapture the beauty and brilliance of DCD, you've come to the wrong place.  This is quite possibly one of the worst purchases I've made in my life, and I feel lied to by each of the reviews posted on this site. <br /> <br />I expected some Ren. style DCD coupled with some dark haunts at least at the level of Evanessence, but instead I got Queen (with all the good parts missing) meets a skinny sixteen year old who got a second-hand synthesizer for his birthday.  This sixteen year old probably decorates his room with cheap gargoyles and plastic skulls, believing his \\"dark arts\\" give him power over the universe, even though the jocks won't stop giving him wedgies... <br /> <br />The \\"music\\" is amateur, unmasterful, and lacks any sort of melodic coherence or consistency.  In truth, it sounds a lot more like something the serial killer from silence of the lambs would listen to when he's prettying himself up like a woman. <br /> <br />I am sorry that Lisa G. and DCD are associated with this group.  I'd be embarrassed to listen to it even in the privacy of my own home. <br /> <br />This is a putrid scar on the body of western music, whose only redeeming quality is that it festers in an obscure place.  God help you if you buy any of their cd's, for you shall get no pity from me.  You have been warned.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Since 70s more than 30 years have passed but looking this dvd it seems that these songs have just some months... songs like those on the tracklist will never die. and also the 2 new tracks have inside the immense and incredible creativity that this band started to give to the world 3 decades ago. just amazing! and you see 4 legendary players playing and singing their wonderful compositions with the eyes closed, paying attention to every single detail or change inside every song. music, voices, choir, guest musicians... all is perfect in a perfect concert. maybe 'hell freezes over' is a little bit 'better' but what you will answer if you'll have to choose between a black and a red Ferrari?
B0009S4IHY|3.0|When this movie started, it was dreadful. Lots of stupid stuff, and  not good enough acting. Also not very funny humor. However, there was one good thing about the first half-the battle scenes. They were great, but it only heightened my liking a small amount. Then there was the second half. More fighting, less dumb humor, and a lot more coolness, especially in the final fight. It was awesome. And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other. I do think they'll be a grand couple. Though it was a good second half, there was just to much loser stuff and stupidity at the start for it to be one of my top movies. But, it  was OK overall, and I thought I'd hate it. Good thing I gave it a  chance to finish. This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion).
0684833395|5.0|After picking this book up and setting it down many times in the bookstore, I was finally prompted to read it for school this summer. What I got was a fantastic journey through the mind of seemingly the only sane person in a bunch of crazed narcicists. From the moment I picked up the book I was conpletely enthralled, and every word had me hanging. I have never felt the frustration of a character in a novel more than Heller's Yossarian. Every time he runs into Catch-22, I feel the tension rise. And Catch-22 applies to more than just the paradox itself. Every little thing in this novel contradicts itself and shines new light on our own world. Milo telling Yossarian that he should not risk his civil rights by exercising them made me wonder about our world today. Heller's novel has relevance in most situations and it is a must read for anyone and everyone, and it has been the most frustrating; but greatest book I have ever read. It is most certainly worth the time.
0792838068|4.0|A full and detailed synopsis of this film can be found in any one of several reviews on this page, so I won't repeat it here.  However, I feel compelled to point out one thing about this film that seems to have been overlooked by other reviewers.    One reviewer writes that this is an excellent example of unconditional love.  Uh, 'scuse me?  Can you say \\"enabler\\"?  Elizabeth Shue's character, a high-priced call girl, meets a drunk who's so wasted that he can't perform, spends the night in his arms listening to his drunken ponderings, physically suffers for this at the hands of her pimp, meets the drunk again and agrees to his demand that \\"You can never tell me to stop drinking\\" as a condition for a more serious relationship, and it's unconditional love?  For heaven's sakes, if you LOVE someone you want them WELL, not overtly suicidal.  Her spectacularly warped maternal instincts in this regard are not at all touching, just sad.  She even buys him a flask as a gift!    But I guess that's part of the film's unique universe.  These characters are completely lost, cowardly, and sad.  He wants her to quit hooking, too, but since she can't tell him to quit drinking he certainly can't approach her with his misgivings either.  Give the film credit for showing each of them grappling with this, but in the end they wimpishly stick to their agreement to allow themselves to wallow in their pathetic circumstances.  Real love has enough muscle to fight over such things; this pale excuse for love is, perhaps, all these lost souls can muster up.    Needless to say, this is not a film for those who must have a happy ending.  While Cage's performance in and of itself was indeed Oscar worthy, the movie overall leaves a bad taste in your mouth like a healthy puke after a three-day bender.  It's fascinating to watch and scream at the characters to grow up and do something about their doomed lot in life, but only once.  They won't listen to common sense in any repeated viewings either, soI won't bother.
0743487478|2.0|First, the good:  Kudos to Mr. Kohn for taking the time to back up nearly all of his assertions with references to scientific studies.  He is correct in his criticism of the vast majority of parenting books that fail to do so.    Now, the bad:  Even assuming that Mr. Kohn presents an unbiased sampling of the literature (something I question from somebody who obviously has an axe to grind) and that his characterization of the studies he quotes is correct, I believe that he still arrives at incorrect conclusions.    Most of the relevant studies he cites represent one of two types.  Either they say, \\"The average performance (by some measure) of kids raised with such-and-such a technique was lower than the performance of kids raised with this other technique.\\"  Or they say, \\"In a controlled setting, a larger percentage of kids who encountered this technique exhibited the desired behavior.\\"    The first kind of study has an obvious potential fallacy involving causality.  Do kids display problem behavior because they were punished a lot, or were they punished a lot because of their behavior?  Mr. Kohn addresses this question, but unconvincingly.  This is one of the few cases where he makes assertions with little empirical evidence to back them up.    But let's assume for the moment that his assertions regarding causality are correct.  All that has been demonstrated is that one technique is usually superior to another - not that it is always superior.  Perhaps 70% of kids will respond better to Mr. Kohn's suggested parenting style, but we are given no reason to believe that the other 30% might not respond better to a traditional rewards-and-punishment style.  And how should I determine which group my child falls in?    Yet Mr. Kohn has the audacity to claim that rewards and punishments should never be used.  He even claims that an eclectic approach - using different methods as the situation demands - will be harmful.  Again, Kohn fails to produce convincing evidence to back this assertion.  The universality he claims for his position reveals the extremity of his bias.    This is not to say that he doesn't give good food for thought, or good suggestions.  It is certainly worth reading the book, if only to rethink your take on the proper role of discipline.  But take it with a grain of salt - especially the more extreme claims.    As for me, I think that for the most part I do follow his parenting style.  But I am firmly opposed to protecting children from the (non-severe) consequences of their actions - a philosophy that Mr. Kohn lumps together with punishment, and brushes aside in a short paragraph with little supporting evidence.  I also refuse to restrain myself from praising my child when I am genuinely proud of her accomplishments.  I believe (without any supporting evidence) that to do so would create the very kind of emotional distance that Mr. Kohn deplores.

Didn't pick up steam until January. And now, they release a crappy limited edition. What a farce.
0393035158|2.0|This book is a very mixed bag, first the good points<br /><br />Harris's description of religious moderates is excellent.<br /><br />\\"Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance - and it has no bona fides, in religious terms, to put it on par with fundamentalism.\\" (21)<br /><br />\\"By their light, religious moderation appears to be nothing more than an unwillingness to fully submit to God's law.\\" (21)<br /><br />\\"Religious moderates betray faith and reason equally.\\" (21)<br /><br />\\"All we can say, as religious moderates, is that we don't like the personal and social costs that a full embrace of scripture imposes on us.\\" (20)<br /><br />Hand the man a cigar he got it right.<br /><br />Harris points upon Islam and his linking of Islam with terror and terrorists is also correct. Throughout history one can see the blood of Islam just as one can see that the writings of Koran call for these horrific acts on the infidels. (Any non-believer of Islam)<br /><br />However, Mr. Harris seems to have gotten more wrong than he has correct. He has transposed by logical error (guilt by association) that since Islam is a violent religion ALL religions must be violent. This of course goes against history and common sense.<br /><br />I posit a simple question when was the last time you saw a Hare Krishna blow themselves up?<br /><br />When was the last time you saw Billy Graham telling his audience to start a holy jihad?<br /><br />Oh and we all remember that scoundrel Gandhi and his band of marauding raiders, just set to rape and pillage our towns.<br /><br />And what about the Jews, hated by everybody including Mr. Harris who blames them and the Roman Catholic Church for the holocaust (100-107)!<br /><br />Reason and logic is not a strong point of the Sammy's polemic.<br /><br />What seems to escape the author is; just what is the common denominator behind some of the most murderous regimes in this world?

B000000IRB|2.0|Thank goodness this was a gift from a friend although after listening to the disc, I'm beginning to wonder if I know the reason why he gave it to me so freely!<br /><br />DSOTM is a unique sonic experience and should be something you listen to uninterrupted with the best system that you have and preferably with your eyes closed and reclining in a somewhat horizontal plane.  As a guitarist myself, I'm a big fan of David Gilmour and some of his best solos are on this album as well.<br /><br />Too bad the sound quality is so poor.  I've already missed the boat on the first issue of the Japanese mini-lp sleeve remastered version so I guess I'll have to hope for either a re-issue or if the powers that be would stop being stubborn about it and let Alan Parsons (the original sound engineer on the album) to be in charge of a new project to remaster and bring this album back to the majesty that it must have sounded like in the studio or die trying! : )<br /><br />As for me, I'll just wait, wish and hope for either scenario to eventuate while trying to sell this dud gold cd version that I'm stuck with for now.
0156421178|4.0|After reading several of Orwells other books, I had come to expect a certain degree of sarcasm in his works. Homage to Catolonia does not disappoint. Orwell succeeds in giving us a brief histroy of the Spanish Civil War. He also makes it readable.<br /><br />In Homage, Orwell explains to us how life was like serving for the anti Franco forces in Spain. He also tells us the motivations and the reasons for the fighting. It's important to note how his skills as a journalist aide us in learning about the history of the War.<br /><br />Overall, HtC will please many because of its satirical view of the War and its historical significance.

Boys, get this for your hopelessly romantic lady who dreams of Paris and pastries. I adore it!

B000002GQL|4.0|...as the Moodies never really attained the heights of the \\"Classic Seven\\" again. There's been some fine material since (like 1983's THE PRESENT), but not with the same creative vigour. Indeed, I always feel that the vigour is beginning to ebb round about here - and as I understand it the Moodies had been writing, recording and touring at a frenetic pace when they laid down this fine set of songs.  Some reviewers seem to wax joyful over the Hayward/Lodge offerings here, but I feel the best work on this album comes from Mike Pinder, who gets my vote as the most underrated Moody. His offerings here, \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" and \\"When You're A Free Man\\" have been dismissed as ponderous, but I feel one can indulge in a bit of neologism here, and call them \\"Pinderous\\" - they are dark and slow but intensely conflicted and evocative. And \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" in particular is very innovative. In the early 90s, a muso mate of mine asked my why I liked the Moodies (this album was released not long after I was born): I played him \\"Lost\\" and he was grudgingly impressed at a rhythm and sound that prefigured the Manchester beat of the 90s and a keyboard/vocal wash that hinted at other acts like Slowdive...of course the MOR ballad \\"New Horizons\\" followed it up and he rolled his eyes and snorted...just as well he didn't stay for Ray Thomas' \\"For My Lady\\".  Actually \\"New Horizons\\" is brilliant - gorgeous melody, delicate synth work and a soaring guitar solo - but there is I feel, ther beginnings of a failure of imagination here, as the Moodies sound becomes an idiom  - an end, rather than a means. \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" and \\"I'm Just A Singer\\" sustain that suspicion: grandiose excursions into mannerism. They still SOUND good, but they lack the freshness of the earlier cuts. So, oddly, for me, it is Pinder's work that enables this album to stand alongside the other \\"Classic Seven\\". The two tracks here are as ever driven by Pinder's restless spirit (my favourite track on the 1978 comeback OCTAVE is Pinder's \\"One Step Into The Light\\" - in part because he seems to have resolved some his perennial quandaries). \\"When You're A Free Man\\" features haunting flute and an understated, but impassioned guitar solo from Justin Hayward. The song ends with a a hauntED cadence, repeating forlornly atop a tortured piece of feedback, as if the plea contained in the song is falling upon deaf ears. Like many Pinder pieces, there is a symphonic and spiritual imagination of considerable scale at work here. Honourable mention goes to \\"You and Me\\" driven by a superb guitar hook (is it just me or does the intro sound like something The Shadows might have come up with?) and \\"For My Lady\\" a sea shanty-type song with a genteel air and sweet lilt. In summary, I don't regard this as being anywhere near the best of the Moodies' 'classic seven', but its presence in that hallowed sequence ought to speak for itself.
B000002VQQ|5.0|I used to see her perform Piss Factory in Central Park,her early days at the Bottom Line,even Avery Fisher Hall all supporting one of the better albums ever made.This one.<br /><br />Not only is it poetry but rock and roll of the highest order produced by John Cale...a total knockout difficult to describe and not comparable to any album made.. Remastered now with her blazing version of a Who cover..too much.I also remember her singing My Generation...when it mattered.
B000006TRV|5.0|What else can I say that hasen't already been said.  But its back on the top 100 again thanks to this remaster.  Profoundly changed my musical tastes in 8th grade when it came out.  Sad to see that the musical industry will not promote bands like Shadow Gallery who have followed in their footsteps.  You have all these people in their 30's and 40's with disposable income, a demograph less likly to copy music, and a grammy winning concept album in green day, yet the best music of this decade is coming out of europe never to see the light of day on American Radio.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I love to watch movies that are a little off the \\"normal\\" track. I don't know why, but when I saw this movie I thought of \\"The Hours\\" and \\"Lost in Translation\\". This movie is just so different, creative and just fun to watch. Like some people said, it is very funny but also very sad sometimes, that's what makes it so perfect. Everything is put together so well. I like to think of movies as more than just entertainment. I want them to be like works of art, something well thought of, not just thrown together. I want a movie to make me think or open my mind a little to something new. and this movie does all of those things for me. every perfomance was perfect, Elijah and Mark were so funny, and Jim with Kate couldn't be more wonderfull. I thought \\"Big Fish\\" would be my all time favorite movie but Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is right beside it now. I really enjoyed this movie.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Most people don't know that there are two versions of this record in the marketplace. Most copies sold are of the first variety - an outstanding record that normal people will thoroughly enjoy. This is why you see so many 4 and 5 star reviews here. There is a far smaller number of the second version, sold only to sanctimonious blowhards who spend their time criticizing anyone and everyone's latest effort, certain that nothing's as good as it used to be. Are you a sanctimonious blowhard? If so, don't buy the album - you won't like it, much as you don't like anything anyway. If not, get yourself a copy. It's great stuff.

B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey has been around for a minute.   I always liked Mariah Carey for her ballads.   On her 1st CD, \\"Vision Of Love\\", I Don't Wanna Cry\\", \\"Loves Takes Time\\" and the timeless \\"Vanishing\\" were in heavy rotation constantly when Mariah first came to the scene.   Other than those 4 tracks, \\"Can't Let Go\\" and her remake of Brenda K. Starr's \\"I Still Believe\\" are favorites of mine as well.   People who look closely at Mariah Carey's career will realize that her ultimate album of being independent and free was \\"Butterfly\\".   \\"Butterfly\\" was the 1st CD that Mariah released without Tommy Mottola riding her coattials.   Now I will admit that Tommy Mottola had alot to do with Mariah's success, but the way that he handled their situation and marriage wasn't good at all.   So the true \\"Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is actually \\"Butterfly\\".    \\"Butterfly\\" showcased Mariah at her best in my opinion.   She was able to make better midtempo songs and she was also able to do the ballads that made her a household name such as \\"Butterfly\\", \\"My All\\" and \\"Whenever You Call\\" which she was able to do another version of with Brian McKnight on \\"#1s\\". Since \\"Butterfly\\", Mariah had a difficult time putting a nice CD together.   The best thing about \\"Rainbow\\" wasn't even on the CD which was the \\"Thank God I Found You (Remix) with Joe & Nas.   \\"Glitter\\" was....., I won't even waste space on commenting on \\"Glitter\\".  Then with \\"Charmbracelet\\", Mariah was getting there, especially with \\"Through The Rain\\", but it just didn't quite do it for me. <br /> <br />With the \\"Emancipation Of Mimi\\", Mariah Carey is officially back.  First of all, Mariah Carey starts off with the 2005 ladies' national anthem with \\"It's Like That\\".   Mariah is at her best when she just lets loose and tells people how she really is and what's on her mind.   With help from Mr. \\"Gotta Getcha\\" himself, Jermaine Dupri, Mariah officially crafted her comeback in one song and every time that a group of ladies hear this song, they sing word for word and are expressing their independence at the same time.  She also has a Scott Storch remix of \\"It's Like That\\" with Fat Joe that is off the hook as well.   For disbelievers who thought that \\"It's Like That\\" was just luck, Mariah hit hard again with \\"We Belong Together\\".   Although the song is very \\"Usher ish\\" since Jermaine Dupri produced the song. Mariah is talking about a situation where females from DC to Pakistan can relate to.  In most cases if someone isn't ready to deal with a real relationship they will try to cover up their true feelings by not telling their mate the truth.   Then finally, they come around evetually and in alot of cases it is already too late.   On \\"Shake It Off\\" Mariah feels exactly the opposite as she is ready to shake off the mate in her life because all of his misbehavior and lies.   These three songs alone will justify Mariah being back in the game.   Mariah Carey and the infamous James Poyser work magic on the stunning \\"Mine Again\\".   This will be another way that Mariah proves that ballads are her strength.   On \\"Say Somethin'\\", The Neptunes put an 80s dance track to use as Mariah and Snoop Dogg take care of the rest.   Although this is a new track you won't be able to tell as the Neptunes will have you wanting to roller skate like you did back in the day to this track.    \\"Get Your Number\\" works for me as Jermaine Dupri tries his hand at an old school sample as well but many people will get tired of Jermaine Dupri's irritating voclas after a few listens.   Twista lends an assist to \\"One & Only\\" just like he did on Trey Songz \\"Gotta Make It\\" an actually ends up making \\"One & Only\\" better than what Mariah's vocals would have done on the song by herself.  Big Jim Wright, who usually works with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis flies solo on 3 Mariah tracks:  \\"Circles\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\" and the gospel themed \\"Fly Like A Bird\\".   It's hard to pick a favorite out of these 3 tracks as if you are a Mariah Carey fan, then you will enjoy all 3.   \\"Joy Ride\\" finally has Mariah expressing some happiness as she has on past slow jams.    After everything that Mariah has been through there is nothing wrong with expressing some happiness. <br /> <br />Overall, as I have previously stated, this is Mariah Carey's best CD since \\"Butterfly\\".  She shows alot of versatility between the ballads, midtempo and uptempo tracks with Jermaine Dupri, The Neptunes, James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright, Kanye West and others supplying the tracks.   Mariah Carey is back ladies and gentlemen.   If you are a fan of Mariah's best work such as her debut CD and \\"Butterfly\\", then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />James' Top 5 <br /> <br />1) Say Somethin' w/Snoop Dogg <br />2) Mine Again <br />3) We Belong Together <br />4) It's Like That <br />5) Circles
B0007P3582|5.0|Don't listen to these people hating on 50 cent.  He was underground for years and now that he sees some success, everybody and their mother wants to hate on his artistry.  He is a great artist that writes catchy choruses.  Although he has definitely dumbed down his lyrics for his radio hits, one must remember that he used to ghost write for many artists in the past and has an arsenal of underground hits under his belt.  Aside from his radio hits, there are a bunch of great tracks on this album; for instance, Baltimore Love Song and God Gave Me Style.  Both of those songs are worthy of some praise atleast, even from the harshest critics.  So please people, let the man live.  Don't just give him 1 star just because you hate his success..
B0007Y08I8|5.0|I thought that this movie was really funny and inappropiate.one thing though is that when the puppets were on the camera they showed the strings.It was really funny and i reccomend that you see it
B00005AQE8|5.0|A very thought-provoking release, although much more toned-down than the dark and venomous Makaveli album, All Eyez on Me was the first double-CD in hip-hop history.  His first release after being set-up and shot 5 times and (wrongfully) being convicted of sexual misconduct (not rape!), Shakur addresses many aspects of his life and society in this album.  Although some of the songs on the disc 2 are lacking substance and had initially forced me to skip them when I first purchased the album in 1996, I must admit that this entire album has grown on me.  Compared to some of the garbage that is released today, All Eyez on Me is not rigidly formulaic, something I can appreciate, and possesses a great deal of content that touches on some of the more ignored or shunned aspects of American urban society.  In my opinion, this album is definitely a must for any true hip-hop fan.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Very good, clean entertainment.  It was not only entertaining but had good moral values and ideas for successful living.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this program until a friend told me the movie was being made.   I purchased the season on DVD and watched it knowing nothing of the show except for from the movie trailer. <br /> <br />Both my wife and I really enjoyed the first (only?) season.  I only recognized one of the actors, the one from Knights Tale.  They all performed good, some exceptionally.   <br /> <br />The show rarely trys to explain the technology, which is great.  They don't have light speed or any of the other crazy technologies that Star Trek and the like have.  They do take months to go from one place to the next which they don't show and convientently ignor in character development.  But that is to be expected.  Ship weapons consist of hand held firearms. <br /> <br />The show has a strange sense of humor.  Along the lines of Brisco County Jr., though this show pulls it off much better.  It is a western in space, such as the original Star Trek was.  Fresh and unique.  The show does cover adult subjects, it is not for kids. <br /> <br />It does leave you wanting more at the end.  Hopefully the movie will do well and a second season will come of this.  <br /> <br />I had never even heard of Firefly, though I was an avid watcher of all the Star Treks, Star Wars, Space AAB, BSG, and many others.   I have to think the lack of promotion is what killed this show, not the show itself.   <br /> <br />Strongly recommend.
B00064MW6K|5.0|When i saw this movie i thought it was great it had lots of action and it was nice to see a villian from the batman series to have her own movie!!!!!! Halle Berry was awesome and she really pulled off the part very well!!!!! I have read some of these other reviews and they gave it terrible reviews,but i really enjoyed this movie!!!!!
B000000OAA|5.0|this is the album with such classics as \\"stone cold crazy\\" and \\"killer queen\\" but those are far from the only great songs here, actually every song is great.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I loved this movie. When I saw it in the theatre, I loved it. So, naturaly when it came out on dvd, I had to have it. Lots of gore, great story, loads of action, the characters. I could go on and on. It's just fantastic.
B000000OA6|5.0|one of queen's best. innuendo sounds like it would have fit into the late 70's era, solid album, a must for any queen fan.
B000068FWC|5.0|after their early prog rock experimentation (supertramp, crisis what ...), caught up in the spirit of the early 80s, supertramp settled down to make a pop album and came out winners with this one. guitars, sax, piano, flutes, rumbling bass, energetic drumming and flawless whistling supplement the dual vocal attack of davis and hodgson.    the logical song and breakfast in america are the catchiest in the album and after the first hearing you're likely to be humming both of them! but after years of listening it is 'the long way home' which stands the test of time and emerges as the best track. closely followed by the brilliant and bitter 'just another nervous wreck'. one for davis and one for hogdson.    the other tracks are pretty good too - gone hollywood, goodbye stranger, oh darling, lord is it mine, casual conversations are all outstanding tracks which over a period of time will grow on you.    years back in when i lived in london, i was listening to a radio rock station, when a request came from a boy in west indies who yearned to be in the usa - the request was for 'the long way home'! at that time i was united with him in such a quest.    memorable album. if you like this one check out the other great album - crime of the century.
B000000OAH|5.0|jazz has a fun mix of music. the bottom line is you could find any style of queen on this album, it may not be as brilliant as \\"news of the world\\" but, it's still a great listen.
B000000W5N|5.0|and a showcase for mick taylor's silky smooth fretwork.    sticky fingers might be \\"drug drenched\\" but still it is easily the most confident, consistent, professionally done, work of art put out by the stones at the peak of their creative abilities. the much hyped exile which atbest shines only in parts pales in comparison to the sheer quality of sticky fingers.    with this album the stones returned to their roots in r&b and this went quite well with the new guitarist mick taylor brought in from john mayall's blues breakers (the stones apparently decided on him after hearing his exceptional solo on mayall's the bear). mick jagger is in fantastic vocal form throughout and charlie watts has never drummed better!    the album kicks off with the furious 'brown sugar', followed by the classy 'sway' which showcases one of the greatest guitar solos in rock music by mick taylor played over nicky hopkins jazzy keyboards. then comes in the sad and beautiful 'wild horses' with some memorable acoustic strumming by keith richards and delicate fretwork by mick taylor. 'can't you hear me knocking' with its trade mark richards riff, in its coda again showcases another of taylor's brilliant solos which is as lyrical as it gets (judging by the tone played probably on a very heavy gibson les paul). laughlike (!!!) slide guitar accompanies jagger on 'you gotta move' which is followed by a raucous 'bitch' (richards playing chuck berry inspired lead?), a moody 'i got the blues' (with billy preston showing his mettle on the keys) and a menacing 'sister morphine' where slide wizard ry cooder plays some amazing lines over richards riffs. the melodic 'dead flowers' was apparently inspired by the late gram parsons and the album ends with the magnificent   orchestral 'moonlight mile' brought to perfection by the combined artistry of jagger/taylor.    as a whole this album is easily amongst the most consistent and qualitative in the history of rock music.    exceptional stuff this from the worlds greatest ...
0064430227|4.0|My children loved this book even though I was doubtful after seeing that the pictures are only in black and purple (the crayon drawings) but I was happily surprised when they asked me to read it repeatedly.  I think it's a great bedtime story.  Highly recommended for ages 3 - 6.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I love this movie and all the ones that have followed.  But in this one, the characters on the screen were just as I had pictured them when I was reading the book.  And when one sees the next 2 films,(or beter yet read the next 5 books) the characters become like friends that you have grown up with.  This series is not just for young people.  They can been enjoyed by all ages.
B000001FOS|5.0|This is far and away the best Yngwie Malmsteen album after his original RISING FORCE lp.  Yngwie goes through lead vocalists like I go through pairs of shoes, but I always felt that Joe Lynn Turner was the best singer to complement Malmsteen on a studio recording.   <br /> <br />This was a great album because Yngwie got a chance to fully develop his sound by melding it with an 80's hair band (ala Poison or Cinderella), but at the same time he freely expressed himself by way of mind-boggling solos, sweep-picked arpeggios and some of the fastest playing I have ever heard.  Examples of this can be found in the three 'hits' from this album, 'Deja Vu,' 'Hold On,' and 'Heaven Tonight.'  The last of the three starts with a fantastic vocal harmony and is probably the 'catchiest' Malmsteen song ever.   <br /> <br />On the other side of the coin, I felt Malmsteen missed the boat on albums like TRILOGY and MARCHING OUT, where we had great hits like 'Queen in Love' and 'Liar,' whereas the remaining songs were never really that great.  On ODYSSEY, however, I find myself enjoying other less known tracks like 'Crystal Ball,' 'Rising Force,' and 'Now is the Time.'  All of Yngwie's solos on studio recordings are improvised and you will never hear the same solo twice.  I always liked his live solos much better, but if I had to pick one studio release where I truly enjoyed his soloing over the live performance, it would be ODYSSEY.  Notable solos occur on 'Deja Vu' and the instrumental 'Krakatu'.   <br /> <br />Listeners not familiar with Malmsteen will inevitably be turned off by the corniness of songs like 'Crystal Ball,' and will dismiss it as unoriginal 80's hair band 'glam rock,' but those of us who can appreciate this style of guitar playing know how important and revolutionary Malmsteen's style was, and continues to be today.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|It was great, loved the DVD. IT arrived the next day
B00082IJ08|5.0|Uhh, dont read Angelo's review. I mean, look at his previous reviews. He has three 1s, and a 2. Here comes the funny part, he gave a 4 to Night Court..ROFL!  <br /> <br />Anyways, I love this cd. I didn't get the first one, but I did hear them back then. I heard that they had came out with a new album, so I went out and bought it. This album is great. I could listen to this cd for a whole day, and it wouldn't get boring.  <br /> <br />Go out and buy it.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I am only going to be reviewing the first 2 CD's in this set, and there are quite a few songs so let's get right into it. <br /> <br />DISC 1: <br />1. Bohemian Rhapsody - To say this song is great would be doing it an injustice. This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest song of all time. It is a true classic and you will listen to it plenty of times. Awesome guitar solo and amazing transition from opera-style singing into hard rock. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Another One Bites the Dust - Another classic song. For some reason it puts me in a competitive mood. I like the guitar and the bass in this song. Very original. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Killer Queen - One of Queen's best songs. Another one of the greatest songs of all time. Great solo and really great vocals. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Fat-bottomed Girls - Not one of Queen's better songs. Starts off slow and never really catches the interest. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Bicycle Race - Who would think a song about riding bikes would be so great? I love the \\"bike bell\\" solo in the middle. Great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. You're My Best Friend - Another one of Queen's more vocally excellent songs. The way the song starts out is great and it gets better. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Don't Stop Me Now - I love this song just because it sounds like the theme song to a 70's TV show. The pace shifts from slow and bluesy into a fast pace showtunes-esque beat. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Save Me - A good song, but there isn't really anything special about it. 7/10 <br /> <br />9. Crazy Little Thing Called Love - This Elvis-sounding song is brilliant. Makes you think of Happy Days just because of the 50's type sound. Awesome song. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Somebody to Love - Next to Bohemian Rhapsody, this is Queen's most vocally talented song. Love the way Freddie Mercury's voice sounds in this song. The one part of the song that stands out to me is the little interlude in which Freddie really shows off the amount of levels he can hit. Nails the extremely high-pitched sound then flows down into a deeper tone. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Now I'm Here - Good song. The beginning is the best part, and the rest is so-so. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Good Old-fashioned Loverboy - One of my personal favorites. Great vocals. Only problem with it is that it's a tad on the homosexual side, but it's almost funny because of that. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Play the Game - Great song. Freddie uses more high pitched voice in this song and it is enjoyable to listen to. 9/10 <br /> <br />14. Flash - The theme song to a show I've never seen. Good song. After they say FLASH, they all sing \\"AAAAaaaaaa\\" and it actually sounds a lot like Styx. This song is good, especially the some of the audio clips from the show. 9/10 <br /> <br />15. Seven Seas of Rhye - Good song that might get quite a few listens from, but the verses aren't too great. 8/10 <br /> <br />16. We Will Rock You - It seems like the CD is starting to travel downhill, and then this song appears out of nowhere. It was smart to start the CD with a few classics and end it like this. If you are a sports fan, this will put you in the mood to watch a hockey game or a basketball game, etc. 10/10 <br /> <br />17. We Are the Champions - Perfect way to end this CD. Probably Queen's 2nd greatest song. Another one of the many vocally special songs. The chorus is extremely vocally strong and the verses are amazing. Great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Disc 1 = 158/170 = 93%. Definitely a must-have. Makes this entire set worth purchasing. <br /> <br />DISC 2: <br /> <br />1. Kind of Magic - Good song. The beginning is the strong point and then it never really tops it. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Under Pressure feat. David Bowie - One of Queen's best songs. The best song on this CD. Absolutely nothing wrong with this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Radio Ga-Ga - This song has a very 80's mood to it, and it's extremely enjoyable. It's a different style of Queen, yet it is still great. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. I Wantit All - Great song. Many people will enjoy this song. It isn't one of my personal favorites however. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. I Want to Break Free - Amazing song. Long introduction, long song, and it really all is great. I love the vocals in this song and the beginning really helps kick it off. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Innuendo - A song that doesn't sound like Queen, but this time it's for the worse. I didn't care for it. 6/10 <br /> <br />7. It's a Hard Life - Reminds me a bit of Play the Game, but not quite as good because it lacks the vocal strength that Queen usually has. 7/10 <br /> <br />8. Breakthru - Another very 80's style song. I like this song. Very fast paced and fun to listen to. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Who Wants to Live Forever - Very different style to this song. Sounds like an opera-style sound, more-so than Bohemian Rhapsody. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Headlong - It seems like Queen was going for more of a metal type sound with this and they didn't pull it off too well. Still a so-so song, however. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. Miracle - One of the best songs on the CD. Vocally strong, instrumentally impressive, and overall enjoyable. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. I'm Going Slightly Mad - The chorus does not sound like Queen one bit, yet it still manages to be one of the better songs on the CD. Great song to listen to. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Invisible Man - Another one of the 80's sounding songs that sounds like synthesizer was used quite a bit. Pulled it off fairly well. 8/10 <br /> <br />14. Hammer to Fall - This song fits into Queen's hard rock category. One of their better categories. Great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />15. Friends Will Be Friends - \\"Inspirational\\" song. Great beat but I thought it was a little cheesy. 8/10 <br /> <br />16. The Show Must Go On - Another amazing song. One of the best on the CD. Great vocals and strong instrumentals. 10/10 <br /> <br />17. One Vision - Seems like a typical hard 70's/80's song at first, but then moves into a good Queen song. Enjoyable. Not the best pick to end the Queen Greatest Hits album, but still a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Disc 2 = 148/170 = 87%. Disc 1 and Disc 2 combine for a total score of 306/340, which is a 90%. Although not as many amazing songs as Disc 1, Disc 2 definitely confirms your reason to buy this set. Disc 3 has some nice remixes, especially Queen feat. Elton John - The Show Must Go On. This is a great set and is a must-have for any Queen fan or anybody who's ever liked at least one song by Queen.
B00005JNTX|4.0|This is one of those rare films where it's best qualities aren't its worst. That only happens in cinema everytime the opposite fails to take place. Having said that, I think every viewer should know something about anything before sitting down to invest time into sitting down (with this movie, naturally).    The story starts out with several related elements, and the scenery only enhances itself. Throughout, the erudite viewer will no doubt pick up some elements of the plot that weren't immediately evident before the movie began. But this is a small price to pay for something that's worth more than the paid price!    By the way: don't look for any cameos by my friend, Jerry, because he doesn't even live in Sin City.

B00011D1OA|5.0|The debate will rage eternally whether or not Julie Andrews should have been Eliza Doolittle.  Certainly Audrey Hepburn's performance has been the subject of quite a large backlash, not only from Andrews fans and Broadway purists, but also from a sizeable number of moviegoers who flout the trend by hating Hepburn and not having any other outlet for this resentment.  What!  You didn't know that there are those among us who actually dislike Audrey Hepburn!  Well, it may be hard to believe but it's true.  When I was growing up I met a sizable pack of aging habitues who dismissed her for simply being uppity and newfangled, not a patch on the \\"real\\" Hepburn (Kate), and spoken of in the tones you often hear Britney Spears referred to today, as utterly talentless.<br /><br />Certainly it must have taken Audrey a certain amount of, well, balls, to use the Hepburn name when there was already a well-establish star with that name.  It sort of boggles the imagination.  Did Kate Hepburn ever reject her?  What secrets did George Cukor, who directed them both, take to his grave?  I remember hearing one story that he took the assignment of directing MY FAIR LADY (\\"with Hepburn\\") having signed on the bottom line and only then did he realize he'd been saddled with Audrey.<br /><br />That can't really be true but it shows something of the difficulties Audrey must have faced when trying to put together her own rendition of Eliza Doolittle.  To my mind, she's exquisite and she doesn't overact the guttersnipe.  Very much.  Indeed I can't imagine Julie Andrews playing the part-in the movie.  Andrews is terrific on the legendary OCA, but the movie needed Audrey and that's where I stand on this momentous topic.  Hooray for the DVD which gives us her own singing for two of the numbers on alternate tracks.  She's not so bad at singing!  Marni Nixon's fine, but Audrey is the real thing.  However don't go by me, I thought Natalie Wood was acceptable singing TONIGHT on the West Side Story DVD!D!
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|this might sound insane, but collectors will understand. Just about everything else you already have, but the 7\\" remixes of When love Cries and Love's About to Change my Heart BOTH include added vocal parts that were not on the original album recordings, and this is the only place you can get these 2 versions on CD!!! That makes this an absolute MUST HAVE.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I am a new fan of Eric Clapton and have only bought one other CD by him, \\"Slow Hand\\".  I knew I was hooked on his music. I listened to some of the songs on the CD \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" on the Amazon site and knew I had to have it. I was not disappointed. This is a must have for Eric Clapton fans.  I will be buying more of his CDs.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This was a great dvd, very insightful. It actually helped me understand the album better and appreciate it more.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Luv MB & IT. Watching the MB feature on E.T. last night just solidified my thoughts about this gorgeous and gifted singer.  <br /> <br />Tomorrow he's doing an outdoor concert for Katie and Matt on the Today Show and I can't wait! If he plays any of the hits from IT I'll just melt. <br /> <br />As so many previous reviewers have said this is an amazing cd and a must have. Key words: MUST HAVE!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Can't say anything that the other 1500 people haven't.  Just want to add my 5 star rating to the pot.  One of the only things in this world that I recommend people just go and buy without ever seeing it, cause you'll want to buy it anyway so you may as well get it done now.
B00004RHZU|5.0|This is the first album I've heard in a long time that I've liked EVERY SINGLE SONG.  The critics think they know what is good and what isn't.  It may not be their PERSONAL taste, but instead of going by their own taste, why don't they ask the people who really matter?? The people who buy the CD. <br /> <br />
B000063JDE|5.0|A shocker of a movie in which the innocent facade of an average American town is torn back to reveal a violent and frightening hidden world. (The opening scene with the bugs under the lawn depicts it perfectly.) One day college-aged Jeffrey Beaumont (played by Kyle MacLachlan) finds a human ear in a vacant field. He takes it to the police; the detective assigned to the case (George Dickerson) is Laura Dern's character's father. She overhears him talking about the case and passes on the information to MacLachlan, her boyfriend. He begins to investigate on his own and enters a world of perversion, kidnapping, drugs, and death. Dennis Hopper plays a character about as evil and frightening as you could imagine. Dern's high-school-girl innocence only adds to the awfulness of what's going on here. Emotions are expressed so powerfully, and they are so brutal and scary, that it becomes painful to watch at times. Although not necessarily an original idea, rarely has looking beneath the calm surface to discover a raging storm been done so engagingly and disturbingly. A David Lynch knockout. Worth a watch.
B00081U6EG|5.0|I tried to be at Wembley for the show but I didn't make it. I waited for this DVD and I am NOT dissapointed! It was worth the wait! If you have any interest in pop/rock music then there is something in this for you. Some of the greats of the last 50years are featured. The sound is excellent although the audiences sound level could have been increased to give it more of a live feel. I would highly recommend this DVD
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|A fairly conventional Hollywood coming-of-age road picture, with an interesting motif: country blues. A Juliard student (Ralph Macchio) is in love with the blues, especially the Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, and he's determined that Johnson recorded 30 songs, not 29 as reported. In order to find out what the 30th song might be, he seeks the help of Willie Brown (played by Joe Seneca), a character mentioned in one of Johnson's records. Macchio busts Seneca out of a nursing home in NYC, and together they head for the Delta. He meets a girls who introduces him to love, and then she dumps him (gotta suffer to play the blues). The ending is a bit over the top: Macchio meets the devil (a rocker!) and they duel it out; no surprise about who wins. The music is the real plus here, especially Johnson's recording of \\"Crossroads\\" as the opening credits role. In truth, Johnson did only record 29 titles; whether Macchio comes to this realization I can't remember.
B00004X10B|5.0|I needed a camera bag that is light weight but able to hold all that I need when using a film 35mm  camera and a digital SLR. This bag if perfect. It will hold 2 35mm cameras(SLR digital) with lenses attached and additional lenses, flash,filters and gadgets. It has a special place designed for extra memory cards and a system to show which ones have been used.It has another special place for film.  <br />The best part is that it is very easy to get in and out of this bag when you  are out taking pictures.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Most everything was wonderful! Jeremey Northam's dreamy handsome and witty portrayal of Mr. Knightley, Alan Cumming's bumbling disgustingly gross portrayal of the vicar, Juliet Stevenson as his wife was hilarious, and Toni Collete was simply so funny as the sweet, yet awkward and consistently love sick Harriet Smith. I bought this movie and have seen it several times.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes but they are minor (Ewan McGregor \\"Frank Churchill\\" hair (iky), Gwyneth Paltrow's occasional stiffness (she was too perfect and didnt seem to relax into her part all the time, although I still thought she did a good job), and some other minor things.<br /><br />All in all, a worthy representation of my favorite Austen novel. :-)
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Released in 1998, this CD is a heck of a collection of \\"Hits\\" indeed.  That said, it's true that this disc is missing LOTS of Phil's hits--not just smaller hits/ radio favorites, but big hits like \\"I Missed Again\\", \\"Do You Remember?\\", and \\"Don't Lose My Number\\".  Phil's got so many superb hits that they easily could have made this an extraordinary two disc set, and that's not even including his Genesis hits.  Still, what we do get here is a heck of a SINGLE disc.  (Clever album cover, too.)    Excluding Phil's 1990 \\"Serious Hits...Live!\\" album, this \\"...Hits\\" disc brings together half a dozen songs that weren't on any prior Phil Collins album, and this time all the songs are in their original studio versions. There's the ultra-catchy duet with Philip Bailey \\"Easy Lover\\" which appeared on Bailey's 1984 album \\"Chinese Wall\\".  There's the regal, soaring power ballad \\"Against All Odds\\", a smash hit from the soundtrack to the movie of the same name (it's actually based on a song Collins had 'left over' from the \\"Face Value\\" era but hadn't used).  There are his two contributions to the soundtrack for the movie \\"Buster\\" which Phil starred in--the intoxicatingly infectious feel-good tune \\"Two Hearts\\", co-written by Lamont Dozier; and his brilliantly reinterpreted version of the Mindbenders' mid-'60s hit \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\" (no offense to Eric Stewart).    As has become the custom, Phil added one new song, but it's not a Collins composition--it's a cover of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\".  Babyface produced it and did the drum programming on it, and it ends up having a frighteningly \\"contemporary\\" sound to it a la the Backstreet Boys or N Sync, but thankfully, this production style has proven to very much be a \\"one shot deal\\" for Phil, and basically all of his subsequent music has found him staying true to himself.  (Thank goodness Phil hasn't done a full album with Babyface producing.)    Another downside is the Phil Collins-Marilyn Martin duet version of the Stephen Bishop composition \\"Separate Lives\\".  I've always found this track to be utterly uncharacteristic of Collins, and it just doesn't suit him.  Bishop's own solo acoustic version of it recorded in the '90s was a revealation to me, but the hit version here is frustratingly sappy and I've never been a fan of it.    There are a couple other iffy inclusions too.  The cliche-ridden \\"Something Happened On the Way To Heaven\\" is one of Phil's worst hits and really doesn't belong here; it should have been left off in favor of one of his numerous superior hits that DIDN'T make the cut.  Also, his cover of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" is a blast, and I actually prefer it to the famous hit version, as I feel Phil's version kinda 'cleans up' the arrangement, but it arguably should have been left off to make room for one or two more Collins-penned songs.  I also want to point out, as other have, that the songs are NOT sequenced in chronological order.    Despite all the gripes, the positives of this disc steamroll the negatives.  Very minor trimmings aside, the songs are all full-length and the sound quality on the disc is superb.  And of course, there's simply no arguing with most of the inclusions--\\"Another Day In Paradise\\"; \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\"; \\"Both Sides of the Story\\"; \\"One More Night\\"; \\"Dance Into the Light\\"; \\"In the Air Tonight\\"; \\"Take Me Home\\"--all great songs, and all collected on one disc, along with the aforementioned gems.    Phil's ability to excite and/ or move you with his music is truly incredible.  In my book, Phil is a true 'album artist'--you really need all of his proper albums from 1981's \\"Face Value\\" through 1993's \\"Both Sides\\"--each of them are masterpieces in and of themselves, and I can't fathom any serious 'pop' music listener feeling otherwise.  And really, to put it a certain way, \\"Face Value\\", \\"Hello, I Must Be Going!\\", \\"No Jacket Required\\", and \\"...But Seriously\\" are practically \\"greatest hits\\" albums unto themselves, with many of the 'lesser known' songshaving received significant radio play or having been big fan/concert favorites.  So, \\"...Hits\\" is certainly high on great songs, but by all means, get the individual albums if you haven't already.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Aficionados of Singing in the Rain have never quite gotten  over the fact that their favourite film only received two (failed) Oscar nominations in 1952, whereas the previous year An American in Paris walked away with five Oscars, in the face of much more formidable competition (by 1952 the House of Un-American Activities had managed to blacklist many of Hollywood's most talented screenwriters). Ever since, this cabal has been fighting this perceived \\"injustice\\", mainly by trumpeting the shortcomings of An American in Paris. Since Singing in the Rain is one of those \\"insider\\" flicks (a Hollywood film about Hollywood), many of it's most fervent supporters are people with real Hollywood connections who can identify strongly with the storyline. And of course if you shout hard long enough, people will eventually listen, so that now all this hocus pocus about \\"The Greatest Musical of All Time\\" has become a bit of revealed wisdom and fact.<BR>Don't get me wrong. Singing in the Rain is a great musical with an engaging plot and still provides wallops of entertainment. But as an artistic achievement, it never  quite reaches the dizzy heights of an American in Paris. The songs composed by Nacio Brown and Arthur Freed are real swell, but not in the same league as the Gershwins. I suppose Debbie Reynolds is about as American as apple pie, but she is no Leslie Caron when it comes to dancing skill and all around sex appeal. The directing team of Kelly and Donen do an admirable job, but neither can match the artistic sensibility of Vincente Minnelli (by far the greatest director of musicals of all time).<BR>Compared to Minnelli, the composition of Kelly/Donen's camera shots have a \\"boxy\\" quality to them.<BR>Singing in the Rain is above all a testimonial to Arthur Freed, who also produced this film along with most of the finest film musicals of that era. As the years pass by, he has become almost a god-like figure in Hollywood lore, especially in light of all the trash masqueradingas cinema that is churned out these days. That a musical such as Chicago can actually walk away with a Best Picture award is testimony to the depths we have sunk to since the Freed era.<BR>The 2 box DVD set is an absolute delight and will give every fan of this great film reason to smile. After viewing, I deeply regretted not being born 25 years earlier.
B00005JMEW|1.0|What can I say, is this what society has come for? All I see is great reviews about a movie that has a large number of scenes of females being butchered and killed in such cold blood. This is morally disturbing as movies tend to present what the social standards may accept. Is it cool for women to butcher and get butchered this way? Movies are not just movies; they are the images they create. And these images are important because have a certain inner effect on society. Even though women are being portrayed as evil in the movie, it is still not morally acceptable to picture them being butchered and sliced. This is unthinkably annoying and highly unethical. As far as I see from the theme of that movie if a women works of an evil organization, then it is ok to butcher her arm, or her head and hear her scream in pain as she suffers and blood pours out! Can you see how ugly the picture is? And the hero is a cold blooded killer. This is how the hero is portrayed.  <br /> <br />   My view of women is they are the beautiful image of humanity which is to be cherished, loved, and cared for and they bring joy, progress, and happiness to life. Not the view of brutal slaughtering and dumped as how they are portrayed in the film. It is very disturbing the amount of such violence in movies these days which is highly portrayed in this film. <br /> <br />    I know this genre of movie is supposed to show this kind of action and that it is men and women being butchered, not just women. Although not great, we got used to men's violence movies that many of us don't actually get affected by it. However this is a new much more horrible trend which many people dislike and will not get used to. This slautering of young women in cold blood is really terrible and the movie shows with blood spurting from their neck, and arms and stomach ... <br /> <br />    My personal opinion is that it is just a very disturbing image to show to a society that has high moral values.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I LOVE Avril Lavigne! I am her number one fan! This album is awesome and I listen to it nearly everyday. <br /> <br />Track 1: Take Me Away- Great way to start it off. Not my FAVORITE song, but I like them all. This song is a good one! 8/10 <br />Track 2: Together- I really like this song. It's about how Avril doesn't feel comforfortable and in love with her boyfriend anymore. Definitely one of the best songs on the album! 9 1/2/10 <br />Track 3: Don't Tell Me- An AWESOME song! Avril's trying to say that no boyfriend will ever be able to tell her what to do. She wears the pants in the relationship and if you don't like it- she doesn't need you. Shows girl power! 10/10 <br />Track 4: He Wasn't- A great song with an awesome beat! Avril's crush turns out not how she thought. \\"He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no\\" is part of the chorus. Really good song! 10/10 <br />Track 5: How Does It Feel- Slower song that Avril expresses the pressure and difference in being a celebrity. The first line of the chorus goes \\"How does it feel to be different from me?\\" Avril definitely shows the downside of being a celebrity sometimes. I really do like this song, but I prefer her more rock songs. 8/10 <br />Track 6: My Happy Ending- In this song Avril is upset about a breakup. She really thought this guy was the one, and then it doesn't work out. Awesome beat and catchy tune. Most popular song on album in my opinion. 10/10 <br />Track 7: Nobody's Home- My favorite song on the whole album! It's about a girl who's family isn't really there for her like they should be. The girl is basically living on the run, trying to live by whay she has. The chorus goes \\"She wants to go home, but nobody's home, that's where she lies, broken inside. With no place to go, no place to go, to dry her eyes, broken inside. Pretty deep! 100/10! <br />Track 8: Forgotten- This is a good song about the importance of meaning something to somebody. She says in the song that she \\"won't be forgotten ever again.\\"<br />Track 9: Who Knows- Kind of flirty, saying \\"who knows what could happen, do your thing and just keep on laughin.\\" I really like this song! 9/10 <br />Track 10: Fall To Pieces- I LOVE this song! It'll keep you singing it for days! \\"I don't want to fall to pieces.. I just wanna sit and stare at you..\\" It's definitely a song about the little pleasures of being in love. 10/10 <br />Track 11: Freak Out- This is an awesome song telling you to \\"freak out let it go\\" and advising you to be yourself no matter what. 10/10 <br />Track 12: Slipped Away- Most emotional song on the album and ever written by Avril Lavigne. It is about Avril's grandpa passing away and Avril did not get the chance to really say goodbye. Expresses how much she loved and misses him. 10/10 <br /> <br />My overall rating on Under My Skin by Avril Lavigne: <br />This is a truly amazing album. Avril Lavigne is very talented and I definitely recommend this album to everyone! This is a definite buzz-worthy album to share with anyone you know! I give this an overall 10/10! <br /> <br />-Renee

B00000J6AG|5.0|I admit, I often get opinionated over some music after hearing about the artists themselves, but in Moby's case: More power to 'im! This music is beautiful, thoughtful, and totally different. Moby's Play rewrites the laws of techno, showing that you don't have to have the usual boring backbeat to make great techno. I love this album. That simple. Even if you don't like techno, this is good stuff, as music. Highly Recommended. <br />
B000021Y77|4.0|While watching Run Lola Run, I was thinking, this movie is either going to be terrible or outstanding, and nowhere in between. As it turns out, this is an outstanding film!  It all came together for me in the end, where the real driving point of the film came through: The choices that we make, as small, meaningless and even subconscious as they may seem, can have a profound impact on the outcome of a situation and someone's life. <br /> <br />Run Lola Run is divided into three versions of the same scenario, in which Lola must come up with 100,000 deutsche marks in order to save her boyfriend Manni from being killed.  Oh, I forgot one thing, she has to get the money in twenty minutes!  Each scenario has a different outcome because of slightly different changes in behavior and choices made.  There are many subtle effects that these changes have from version to version as well, so pay attention!   <br /> <br />And in the end, we see that as impossible as it may seem, sometimes we hit that 1 in a million shot.   <br /> <br />I gave Run Lola Run 4 stars because I thought that the techno soundtrack got old after about a half hour.  I think that the style of music definitely contributed to the fast paced nature of the film, but I thought more could have been done in terms of changing the music up here and there to give a more climactic effect at certain points.  Thats really my only complaint.   <br /> <br />I'm glad that foreign filmmakers don't waste their time making movies like spider-man and dude wheres my car, and actually provide the world with intellectually and visually stimulating entertainment.
0385338082|5.0|So you are sitting on an airplane that is experiencing heavy turbulence, what do you do?  You turn to the person sitting next to you and spill your most intimate secrets because you think your are going to die so who cares.  That is exactly what happens to Emma Corrigan who is on a rocky airplane ride after a disastrous business meeting.  Can things get any worse?  Yes they can.  The passenger next to Emma is Jack Harper the owner of Panther Corporation, Emma's employer.<br /><br />This book was entertaining to read because Jack was able to use all of Emma's most embarassing secrets and tell them at the most inappropriate time to make for some hilarious moments throughout the book.  If you have ever shared a secret with someone to then live to regret ever telling that person then this book is for you.<br /><br />Can't wait to read her next book, The Undomestic Diva.
0099474425|5.0|Set in the late 1770's, of all Georgette Heyer's books, The Convenient Marriage is la cr&egrave;me de l&aacute; cr&egrave;me of great reads, right up there with Cotillion, Venetia, Arabella, These Old Shades, Frederica, and The Grand Sophy. Like many of her heroes (such as Mr. Beaumaris in Arabella), Marcus, Earl of Rule is, in the words of Jane Austen, &#34;the epitome of manly excellence&#34; with one obvious flaw: he is a &#34;rake,&#34; though a fairly moral one. He is, after all, thirty five years old and a product, to some degree, of the morality of his class and times. Seventeen-year-old heroine Horatia Winwood (named after her godfather, real-life Horace Walpole, 1717-1797), or Horry for short, is one of Heyer's most delightful creations.<br /><br />Horry captivates the Earl, and the reader, by cataloguing her flaws as she proposes a switch: that he marry her instead of her sister who is in love with a young officer named Heron.  Despite the age discrepancy, they marry.  It is to be a marriage of convenience, as Horry naively points out; she engages not to interfere with Rule and expects, as a matter of course, the same of him. Gradually, as she learns a bit more about life and the social world she has barely entered, Horry finds this arrangement not at all what she wants.  And Rule, suave but unexpectedly uncertain where his young wife's heart is concerned, discovers the same.<br /><br />It's a mad romp through pages of expert and witty dialogue, cleverly wrought misadventures, and scenes both hilarious and tender, complete with superbly written side-characters who work either to destroy the marriage by bringing ruin on the bride (in one case as a method of revenge upon the groom) or to save both the marriage and the bride in rather bungling ways. Despite the various efforts of well-wishers and ill, Rule and Horry find themselves in a marriage that is exactly what each truly wanted: a marriage of mutual fidelity, love, and esteem.e well-educated, classy look it deserves!

B000001FFJ|5.0|Tom Waits was the true heir to the beat generation. His poetry (and beleive me, the songs are very poetic) is witty, surreal, and at times touching, making Kerouac, Burroughs, and Ginsberg proud. While he never hit the mainstream, most people are at least familiar with his name or some songs of his that were covered (most notably the horrific Rod Stewart rendition of \\"Downtown Train\\"), and he has a cult following possibly more-so than any other singer-songwriter out there. Even though he has produced many great albums, his masterpeice is \\"Rain Dogs\\". I know its a cliched choice, but sometimes the hype is right. The album isn't as much of an innovation in Waits' style as \\"Swordfishtrombone\\" was, but its a better and more consistent work than the previous album. There are two main reasons why Wait's compositions work so well. One is the instrumentation is unique, as Waits employs a wide range of objects and obscure instuments to be used for making music. The second reason is the lyrics. Waits can be surreal (\\"Singapore\\"), humorous (\\"Anywhere I Lay My Head\\"), aggresive (\\"Big Black Mariah\\"), and even romantic (\\"Downtown Train\\"). He may be acquired taste, but those who get him love him.

0385338082|5.0|This was the first book I have read from this author and it will not be the last. If you're looking for a book to really challenge your mind...this book is not for you. But, if you're looking for a light read with loads of humor you can just breeze through, then this book is definitley it. It's funny, romantic, and so many women can relate to the secrets the main character Emma has, it makes you really feel for her and want to laugh and cry right along with her. I stayed up until 5:30 AM reading this book because I could't put it down. This will be a favorite of mine for years to come.

0385512104|5.0|Based on my experience as the parent of a 19-year old autistic person, I believe this book offers tremendous insight into the working of the autistic mind.  Sensitively and wonderfully written, Haddon translates autistic experience in ways that can be understood by those of us who perceive the world in the \\"normal\\" way.  While all autistic persons are vastly different, and the autistic narrator of the novel is an extremely high-functioning person, Haddon brings the unique point of view of an autistic person to life in ways that are suddenly comprehensible and humanizing.  In short, I believe this is an outstanding work that I would highly recommend to anyone dealing with or interested in autism.

B00028HBKM|5.0|1 Corinthians 1:18 - For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.    This movie vividly depicts how Jesus took our sins upon Himself.  He bore the punishment that we all deserve.  He did this because He loves every one of us.  Jesus (who is God) lived a life completely without sin, and served as the perfect sacrifice in order to cancel our debt of sin.  God created us with free will.  While we are all held responsible for our choices, God, in His Perfect love and fairness, held Himself accountable for our ability to act against His will.  In John 15:13, Jesus says: \\"Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.\\"  In Romans 5:8, the apostle Paul explains: \\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\\"  What Mel Gibson was trying to capture in this movie is a chilling representation of what our God was willing to endure to make the relationship with humanity right again.  All that He asks for in return is faith and repentance.  We do not deserve such uncommon grace from the One whom we show contempt toward each time we sin.  Salvation is a free gift to all who are willing to accept Christ, and His sacrifice on the cross.  We cannot earn this gift.  This is why it is called GRACE.  A God who was willing to suffer humiliation and an excruciating death, in order to make eternal life with Him possible for everyone, is simply AMAZING!  If you choose to reject this God, who loves you so much, it is your God-given choice to do just that.  God loves you enough to let you make your own decisions.  I, on the other hand, only love you enough to write this review.    God bless!
B00005QENZ|4.0|I discovered Aerosmith in '93 when my moms bought me GET YOUR WINGS. I went on an aerosmith binge for a couple of months thinking that this was another long lost band before I realized that they were alive and well and living on MTV. It's been a long time since then and I now have pretty much the whole A-smith catalogue. I can't believe how much crap this album gets from the other reveiwers. AMAZACRAZYCRYIN, AMAZACRAZYCRYIN, bla bla bla. Didn't any of you guys ever actually listen to the album? Don't tell me it ain't as good as PUMP. This album would kick the crap out of PUMP in any bar fight. Granted there are a few weak tracks in the middle, but the rest is meaty. Solid stuff. This album is the half way between heavy and girly. It's where metal heads hook up  with bubble gum girls. But I'm a rocker INTRO>EAT THE RICH>GET A GRIP>FEVER> LIVIN ON THE EDGE, is enough to satisfy that urge. I don't mind if you slow it down a little. After that sonic boom at the beggining the album hardly slows at all. A couple tracks to ease out alittle then SHUT UP AND DANCE (play this song for your baby's mama). As far as AMAZACRAYCRYIN' goes... I had no problem seeing Alicia silverstone and Liv Tyler shakin' it all over MTV for like three years. What is there now? I liked CRYIN' it was decent for a chick song, and AMAZING is a great album closer. Deep winded, get to know Steve Tyler he's a hell of a cat. Stop cryin' about this album if your one of those people, if you never heard this thing its the best stuff since ROCKS (1976) don't listen to those jerks.

0792840461|4.0|I recently saw, for the second time, Norman Jewison's clever 1968 caper, \\"The Thomas Crown Affair,\\" and although I prefer the recent (1999) remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, this older version gives the new one a run for its money. The 60's flick is even superior in some ways. When I originally saw the movie, 30+ years ago, I was amazed at the cinematography, (the innovative Haskell Wexler behind the camera). The use of multiple screens, sometimes six or seven separate images at a time, during the robbery is extremely effective. The entire \\"look\\" of the film was new, experimental, hip, fresh. And it still looks good after all these years!<br /><br />Steve McQueen is outstanding as Thomas Crown, an edgy, jaded businessman, more anti-corporate than not. Crown wants to stick it to the system that he keeps beating. Arrogant and competitive, he is bored with winning the old fashioned way - legally. He wants to dabble in bank robbery for a change - more exciting than gliding and car racing any day. I don't think he plans on giving up his day job, however. He masterminds a meticulously planned heist on a Boston bank with great elan. The man is looking for thrills. He certainly doesn't need the cash. Four total strangers are hired, all experts in their particular line of burglary and embezzlement. None of them know Crown. Two million six hundred thousand dollars is the take - which had much more purchasing power in 1968 than the same amount nowadays! Crown flies to Switzerland after committing the perfect crime. He opens a secret bank account, making arrangements to pay-off the five men anonymously.<br /><br />Boston detective Eddy Malone, (Paul Burke), teams up with ruthless, but extremely attractive, independent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson, (Faye Dunaway - who is a relatively new face here. She had yet to appear in \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\"). Ms. Anderson gets her kicks putting away folks who scam the system. And she's closing in on Crown, who has met his match. Of course there's sexual tension - but not as intense as the 1999 version. McQueen's Crown has a darker side than Brosnan's. And while Pierce is debonair, as ever, Steve looks somewhat awkward in three piece suits. Dunaway is a bit cooler, more serene, than the torrid Ms. Russo, but effective nevertheless. No nude scenes in this one, but lots of clothed chemistry. HOWEVER, the movie has the distinction of featuring the \\"longest kiss in cinema history, with McQueen and Dunaway liplocked in one scene for 55 uninterrupted seconds.\\" Just a fact I picked up while writing the review.<br /><br />There's a terrific chess game in the film between Vicki and Thomas - I won't tell who wins, nor will I tell what happens afterward. The ending will come as a surprise to those of you who have yet to see this version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\" The film makes for excellent entertainment. Nothing deep - just a good caper with an interesting look at the US culture of the late 60's....and McQueen and Dunaway, of course!<br /><br />\\"Windmills of your Mind,\\" the movie's an Oscar winning song, scored by Michael Legrand, remains one of my favorites.<br />JANAthere's sexual tension - but not as intense as the 1999 version.

B0008F113W|5.0|To commemorate their 25th Anniversary, Roadrunner Records will be re-issuing a series of landmark releases with plenty of extra and previously unheard material. To honor one of the most unique and ground-breaking metal albums of the 90's, Roadrunner pulled out all the stops and spared no expense. \\"Demanufacture,\\" Fear Factory's epic masterpiece from 1995, as presented here, in a deluxe two disc set, with a grand total of 33 tracks, is everything and anything a hardcore Fear Factory fan could ever want.<br /><br />Aside from the classic \\"Demanufacture\\" album being remasted with all it's b-sides and scattered remixes intact, within this package, you also get \\"Remanufacture,\\" the previously released and appropriately titled remix album. So, if you're not up on your Fear Factory discography, this is a good way to kill two birds with one stone. If you already own the originals (and even the \\"Demanufacture\\" digipak), there are still a few treats to make this worth your purchase. And let's not forget how crisp the newly remastered \\"Demanufacture\\" sounds in 2005! The original had a rather crushing, spacious sound, but somehow they managed to take things up a notch with a few minor alterations.<br /><br />As for the actual album itself, \\"Demanufacture\\" is arguably Fear Factory at their best. While fans tend to bump heads as to which album is their best, I don't think anyone can deny that this is the one album that perfectly captures ALL of Fear Factory's dynamics. The signature rhythm section of Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers, the buzz-saw riffs of Dino Cazares and the brutal growl and beautiful melody of frontman Burton C. Bell -- it's all perfected to a science here. The electronic influence the band aquired after the \\"Fear Is The Mindkiller\\" EP (which contained remixes from the unusually thrashy \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\") becomes a huge element of the band's sound here, and really helps set them apart from their peers -- at the time at least, as many bands have popped up over the years, whose influence can obviously be traced back to Fear Factory. Also, as noted in the liner notes, it helps to push along the theatrical element of the band, their interest in sci-fi that got them dubbed as \\"Terminator Rock,\\" with \\"H-K (Hunter-Killer)\\" being the prime example. Fear Factory truly carved out a name for themselves with this album. They really did something that no one had done before, and if someone were looking for a place to start on Fear Factory, I would point them in this direction.<br /><br />I recommend this re-release to any Fear Factory fan. There is just so much material to absorb, and you get it all at a rather fair price. Although the remixes that are tacked onto the end of \\"Remanufacture\\" (and also appeared on the \\"Hatefiles\\" release) are rather redundant, most of the remixes, which were experiments in themselves, are pulled off rather well, and add new elements to songs that already had so much potency to begin with. And I really can't say enough good things about \\"Demanufacture.\\" As far as I am concerned, it's an essential metal record. It is by far one of the most interesting and original things to come out of the 90's, and really broke down a lot of walls. If you don't own it already, what better time than now?have popped up over the years, whose influence can obviously be traced back to Fear Factory.

B00005M989|5.0|This cd is great!   It includes 17 of Prince's best hits. I like his classic hits such as..Purple Rain, 1999, Little red corvette and I will Die for you.  A good cd to have by this incredible performer.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave's debut album is really dificult to review, and that's because its \\"parent bands\\" were so good in different aspects. If Audioslave's goal was to deliver a \\"new sound\\", then they failed, and that's because in this debut the RATM riffing is way too much evident, the music is pretty much plain and simple; furthermore, Tom Morello quited doing all of those pirotechnical sounds, leaving the combination of effects just for some solos in an attempt to gain distance from RATM I guess.     However, Audioslave manages to put out really strong and catchy songs, some of them could even be sung in the shower if you want: Cochise, Like A Stone, Show me how to live, What You Are.     Bottomline: Audioslave's debut is good enough and recommendable for those fans that like the melancholic and sort of introspective lyrics by Mr. Cornell, this time accompained with a solid band, with a plain, yet solid sound. Not that recommendable for people who has high expectations in Audioslave as the perfect combination of the best of both's RATM and Soundgarden.
B00000DI06|5.0|I love this album.  After singing 'Requiem' several years ago, it brought it all back to me.  Amazing soloists, superb sound, the next best thing to hearing it live (or performing it myself).  A must have for any John Rutter fan, or choral singer.  <br />
B00005AAFS|4.0|Rammstein ist die Beste Rockband im Deutschland und sollte auch im Amerika sein. Horen Sie diese CD fur ein lange Zeit. Es gibt vielen wunderbar lyrics und Melodies fur alle Menschen!<br /><br />Ich bin aus!!! LOS!!!<br /><br />...ohhh and a sidenote...if this is your first time buying a Rammstein CD prepare to be blown away
B0009SOFFY|5.0|I have been listening to FUN HOUSE since it was new, and 30-odd years later, there's still nothing like it. Every time I hear \\"t.v. eye\\", it just kills me! All devotees of rock's wild side need to get this ASAP, as it's the best release yet of this beyond-classic record. The second disc of outtakes is very kool and well worth the extra money. Also pick up Rhino's reissue of THE STOOGES, which is equally essential. Iggy Pop and the Stooges are long overdue for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and these new reissues prove it in spades: BUY!
B0002OERI0|5.0|You know, as i read the reviews of some of the people who didn't like the alblum, there are striking similarities: no grasp of the concept of grammer, punctuation, or any of the basic skills needed in writing a sentence. Whereas most of the people giving it good reveiws are articulate and can define what they do and don't like about it.  <br /> <br />Now, on to the alblum...it's one of their best. The diversity of the songs and the range of emotion that this alblum goes through-greenday may be just a 3 chord punk band, but they're a damned good one. And as to those people who say that greenday isn't really \\"punk\\"...as i remember it, being \\"punk\\" was doing what you wanted whether other people liked it or not-and isn't that what greenday is doing with this alblum? Of course this can't be like dookie-that was over ten years ago, and we have to hope that they have matured since then and aren't still writing songs about how bored they are. (longview) This alblum may not be all power chords and screaming, but it's a great alblum nonetheless....and is worthy of all the praise it can get.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Very entertaining and the Eagles are still the best!!!!
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it. Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life. His father Thomas Wayne, played by actor Linus Roache (The Forgotten) and his wife were killed by a thug. Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter). Years later the thug that killed his parents is found not guilty and is shot coming out of the court room. So, Bruce Wayne turns to the life of crime and ends up in a prison camp where later he meets a man named Henri Ducard, played nicely by Liam Neeson (Kingdom Of Heaven), who tells Bruce Wayne that he can become a \\"legend\\". So, Bruce Wayne goes to the temple of Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Wantanabe (The Last Samurai), and begins his training but Ra's Al Ghul has devious things in plan which Wayne doesnt want to be apart of, so Wayne fights his way out of there saving Ducard's life. So, Wayne returns from being gone 7 years and his father's company being run by another man, who is played by Rutger Hauer (Sin City). Plus, Gotham City is corrupt all over by the hands of Falcone, played with a overhammed Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour). Wayne's childhood sweetheart Rachel, played by Katie Holmes (The Gift) is on the verge of getting rid of Falcone and his scum. Enter Dr. Jonathan Crane, played with balls by Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), who puts on a orangish sack over his face spraying his victims with a powder substance that the victim can see what they fear....his villain name is called The Scarecrow. Soon, Wayne becomes Batman...a very buff Batman with help from his father's friend Lucious Fox, a very groovy Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Wayne also has the help from cop Cheif Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace). Soon, Wayne finds outthat the baddies are trying to poison the water supply and an old friend is behind it all. Fast, fierce and exciting....much, much better then 1997's Batman and Robin which was a big disappointment with the Batman suit having nipples and Clooney's unconvincing performance. Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly. Also starring Mark Boone Juinor (Se7en) as Gordon's corrupt partner.  <br />
B000002JS6|5.0|Grab your balls one time and get blown away. I don't even want to reveiw this album because I've read some others and I can't put it much better than them. If you think you've never heard AC/DC you have. At least YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG or the title track. Read some other reveiws, they are really excellent reveiws, except for the people who gave it like two stars. Get some perspective. If you don't know much about AC DC please read my reveiw for DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP by clicking on READ MY OTHER REVEIWS.
B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie was a big disappointment for me. It kind of just dragged on. I didn't get bored with the movie, but I was excited watching it either. It had a touch of Quentin to the movie, but not near as good as Quentin does it. Its almost like a weird bad version of Pulp Fiction. Except Pulp blows this movie out of the water. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Elijah Woods. His part was super groovy. But thats it. I would suggest renting this movie before you buy it. All the people I've talked to did not like the movie, but there are a lot of reviews on this site that do like the movie. I guess its just a acquired taste. I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert. Never been a big fan of his except Desperado. And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it. If you don't like a lot of senseless nudity, you won't like this flick. That alone will keep me from ever watching this movie again..
B000059MEK|5.0|I didnt really consider myself a fan of Daft Punk, let alone techno music at all, until i was at a party and everyone who was in the \\"cool crowd\\" who danced just amazing, said \\"time to bring out the classic\\" and they brought out Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. I know this album is more than that one song, but that song is a huge part of the Discovery foundation. One More Time is the greatest song cuz it shows me that you can never have too much fun when you are just with your friends out on the town having a great time. Aerodynamic was weird at first, but then i heard the guitar solo that lasted for more then a minute. it just amazed me from then on. i remember rewinding that pert in particular in that song. Digital love, is the perfect song in the position it is on Discovery. one more time is about celebration, aerodynamic is about the actual nightlife, and digital love comes on and just calms you down until you get towards the end when you hear the amazing advancments in beats, rhythms, electronics put into music. The rest of the CD is the same. Nightvision is like a cool and calm moment to just remember where you are, to sober up if you will. and another great song is number 10, Voyager, just has an amazing tune to it. This album is truely one to go into the history books. It is the album with every song that you will hear once, then HAVE to play them all over One More Time.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|It is an awesome move that my kids enjoy watching over and over.
0780622553|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. Looking for sci-fi flicks I have yet to watch on NetFlix, I read stunning reviews regarding Dark City. I eagerly dropped it into the queue, and in two days it landed on my doorstep. Unfortunately, after 30 minutes, I punted the movie, and sent it back.<br /><br />Good actors, but horrible material to work with. The villains were hokey, and Kiefer Sutherland was horrible as the mad scientist. He kept breathing like a goofball between every word, as if his breathing technique would make up for a lack of creating a convincing character.<br /><br />Yes, the world was dark, and gritty, and all that. The story was plausible, but the screen play was cheesy. In the end, I was left saying: what a waste! What a waste of acting talent. The world moved on, and so did I. If you have friends who say this is better than the Matrix, should should call your local phone company ASAP and have their number blocked.<br /><br />Check it out. You might like it. Me? I took a bathroom break after 30 minutes and decided to take a nap rather than finishing this stunningly cheese-puff yawner.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 15<br /><br />7 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />2 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />1 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />3 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />2 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?
B000286RKW|4.0|When I saw this film, I didn't know what to expect. I guess the title is a bit of a joke, because these are violent and horrible men- nothing \\"good\\" about these \\"fellas\\". For those who don't know, it is a Mafia movie.  <br /> <br />A lot of scenes really made me a little sick. But since it is a true story, it must be seen. Like the nudity in \\"Schindler's List\\". You just have to grin and bear it in the name of authenticity. <br /> <br />What I did like were the peformances. I am a big DeNiro fan (especially \\"The Fan\\" and \\"Awakenings\\") and he doesn't disappoint here at all. He is volatile and dangerous. The real scene stealer though is Joe Pesci from \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Vinny's Cousin\\". He is unbelievable. I don't know if he got an Oscar at the Academy Awards for this, but he should have.  <br /> <br />I learned a lot about life in the Mafia from this film. More than from the \\"Godfather\\" even.  <br /> <br />Just be warned- it IS violent, so put the kids to sleep before you pop this one into the machine!
B00013F38K|4.0|The first season was a joy to watch! After watching three or four episodes at one sitting, I desided to savor the remaining episodes, one each evening. It was my Buddhist lesson just before bed. I was serene, by the end of the hour long episode; the stress of the day had run out of me.  <br /> <br />The transfer itself was well done. Many, but not all, had the look of a high grade digital master with the dirt removed. The episodes that had the dirt removed looked amazingly clear, as if I was watching for the first time all over again - which made the episodes that didn't have a dirt pass done look pretty bad by comparison.  <br /> <br />The extra content was enlightening, so much so, that I was very disappointed to not have more. I learned a great deal about the making of the project, and just how special it was at that time, or any time in TV history.  <br /> <br />None of the technical issues mattered once the theme started. It sucked me in to the lessons and calmed. I remember looking forward to each new lesson/episode as a child, and they have not lost their message or joy with the passing of time. I'm grateful I can now watch them as often as I like.
0060763280|5.0|I have attended T. Harv Eker's 3-day seminar, which you can attend for free if you buy the book (read directions in back to register).  As a lifetime struggling screenwriter with a gift for poverty, I can honestly say that it changed my life (attended June 2005).  The bottom line lesson...MY OWN beliefs and attitudes toward money/wealth are what prevented me from moving forward financially.  The book and seminar are about GETTING OUT OF YOUR OWN WAY (it ain't  a how-to book).  Go, go, go!
B0002OERI0|5.0|i absolutely love green day.  the best songs on the album are probably the following <br />1)WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS: this song not only has great notes, and good singing, it also has lyrics that mean something. <br />2)AMERICAN IDIOT: totally describes George Bush ( who can't read).  jk:). fast paced and fun to sing, american idiot is definatly one of the best songs... evur... i mean ever. <br />3) HOLIDAY: upbeat and a great music vid.  really fun.  it make you want to sing along. <br />4) BOLUV. OF BROKEN DREAMS: PART TWO OF HOLIDAY <br />slow, it's practically the only slow song on the album, and unique, it makes you want to sing along.
B000AM4PBS|1.0|Even though I share feelings with you guys considering \\"Friends\\" the best show of all time, why the f*ck is Warner releasing a special commemorative box with all 10 seasons at such a low price as $20 a season while all of us fans (wich probably have already bought all nine seasons!) have been paying so much more money for these dvd's!! And what have we got for free?? Absolutely nothing!! <br /> <br />I don't mean to be a freak but I believe I'm right about this and you may feel the same too. I wish I hadn't bought all of the previous seasons and spent so much more money than this package costs and I would've got this cool box.
6304708491|5.0|if you remember the 60s and the james bond era,then this movie needs no introduction to you..its simply sensational and holds up well as far as the era it was made in goes. <br /> <br />for newer viewers,it may seem confusing. <br />the beatles were at thier peak when they did this movie. <br />they were the biggest thing in music no matter what anyone says. <br />and they knew it. <br />that comes accross to some viewers as they \\"just did whatever they wanted\\" <br />and they certaintly did! <br />the james bond connection will come once the newer/younger fan sees goldfinger or thunderball... <br />the beatles themselves called this movie as it was..and excuse to enjoy anyplace or any plot they wanted. <br />a must own no matter who you are..as long as you like the beatles. <br />be open and enjoy!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I just can't get enough of these girls. I dont' know what these other eviewers are talking about,  I reckon all these songs are totally live, and I saw them in Kansas a few weeks ago and they sang their hearts out. The overall quailty of the music is amazing, I reckon maybe they had to rerecord a few songs after if there was a better take or whatever. Anyway these girls have captured my heart and I thank God these production people put so much work into making it such a memorable concert. I can't wait to go see them again!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|His outdoor concert performance on this mornings Today Show with Katie Couric and Matt Lauer was magnificent. To be able to sound so good live at the Plaza just proves that It is Michael Buble's Time. <br />How sweet it was! It's Time --- YES!!!!!!!!!!!
0743454537|5.0|If you are a Jodi Piccoult reader, then you know that there is usually a shocking twist in her stories.  Well, this book is no exception.  This was an excellent story told by the different characters in the book and from their point of view.  Excellent writing on a very controversial subject!  The story was heartbreaking and emotional.  It makes you feel for all the characters and many times throughout the book, I wasn't sure whose side I was on.  You can completely understand each and every one of them and feel their pain.  The entire book was a real page turner - especially the courtroom scene - and the ending was so unexpected and powerful that the tears were streaming down my face.  This was by far my favorite Jodi Piccoult book!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Fantastic show smart funny dramatic intense I love it keep it up.

6304119046|5.0|I have so many wonderful images stored up from this film: the boy Kane framed in the window playing \\"Civil War\\" in the snow while his parents, in the foreground, fight their own \\"civil war\\" over him . . . the way Kane's eye registers shock (such perfectly calculated lighting here) when his wife reads the address of his mistress . . . his image reflected infinitely in opposing mirrors, so difficult to explain the effect of that one but it's so right in context . . . poignant images and funny images, too, like when the camera pans up after the aria to reveal the stagehand holding his nose . . . that kills me . . . and how about the parallel scenes wherein Kane is accused of being both a communist and a fascist.  But there are so so many . . . <br />
B00005YXZH|4.0|... but I'm not entirely convinced.  However, the production is excellent, lyrics are thoughtful, and it certainly ranks in the top half of Wilco releases to date.
0975991477|4.0|The understandings in this book helped me with some guidelines for moving forward from a time of ill health I have been in to moving forward again.  I have been ill for some time and read and have seen many miracles including mine.  To move forward after preparing for passing I did not know the steps to take for life again being reborn is great but to move into a new life is much harder.  The great books I have read and been inspired by left some questions and I feel the information in this book is helping me with that.
B000002MUW|5.0|Abou 10 years ago, I was into everything Madonna. I had a huge crush on her, and I bought everything Madonna. I had her films, her photos (I slept with them under my pillow) and her albums. And for a while, my favorite album was 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\". After a while of course, I got over my Madonna obsession, though I still loved her music. A short time ago, I rediscovered this album and gave it a listen. Wow! I forgot how good it was.<br /><br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" is Madonna's best and most mature effort. This is her artistic waterloo. Her songs on here represent a thoughtful, grown up Madonna and she actually often apologizes for her actions in the past (\\"Truth Or Dare\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"Sex\\"). Songs like \\"Take A Bow\\" (her biggest hit single ever), \\"Secret\\" and \\"Rain\\" are among the finest singles Madonna ever recorded, but it's the album tracks that grab your attention. \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\", \\"Survival\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Inside Of Me\\" and \\"Love Tried To Welcome Me\\" are just as good as, say, \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"Vogue\\". Of course, there are a few less then stellar tracks (\\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories, the two worst singles ever released, though the video \\"HN\\" was great), but otherwise, this is probably Madonna's finest effort. The booklet is nice, Madonna looks beautiful in the photos. Definitely a recommended album.
B000089RVX|5.0|Personally I think if you don't like this album it's because you totally missed the whole point to the album and the meaning behind the lyrics. In actuality I think the lyrics are about how Amy and or the other writers feel betrayed by the Christian Church because of the fact that it claims to stand for the good and right and just but in actuality behind the laymen's backs it tears the world to pieces for its own gain. Just look at the Crusades for cryin out loud. They purposely sent people over to the Middle East in a war to gain wealth for themselves. I think Everybody's Fool shows it the best lyrically. I think part of the reason that they're getting so popular is that they're so different than the lame ass bands on MTV. The bands on MTV don't even play or write their own music. Evanescence does play and write their own music they even produce and arrange it. If you're not into them then my guess is you're a boyband loving 12 year old little girl.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Along with Woodstock, the 1985 Live Aid concert was the most important concert in rock and roll history. It was indeed the Woodstock of the 1980s'. 20 years later, Live Aid has finally arrived on dvd. How does it hold up? Read on.<br /><br />Well, ladies and gentlemen, Live Aid looks and sounds great. The remastering job is superb. It is also remarkably priced. I expected to be about $ 120, but it's about $ 30. I guess Geldof and company knew that by giving it a low price, more people would pay for it and the people in Africa who this concert is benefiting will receive more profits. Good thinking their, Bob.<br /><br />And the performances themselves? Well, there's no doubt that a lot of the performers (Style Council, Thompson Twins, Status Quo, Thompson Twins, Howard Jones, Paul Young, Simple Minds) are all but forgotten about. But then they're are those performers who to this day own the music world: The Beach Boys, David Bowie, The Who, Elton John, Madonna, U2,- Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Black Sabbath, Madonna, Phil Collins, Duran Duran (who would've expected them to survive the 1980s'), Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, and of course, Queen. Queen's performance is considered legendary.<br /><br />The songs \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\" and \\"We Are The World\\" may be cheesy now, but thye are still great to me. It's interesting note that a lot of the performers who sang these songs didn't even perform at the shows, but that doesn't matter, since their contributions were appreciated.<br /><br />As for the deleted performances, most of them could live without, but I'm irked that two of Black Sabbath's songs and all of Led Zeppelin's set are both missing. Other than that, this is an absolute must have for any music fan.
B000646MNE|5.0|The package came early, it was nicely packed and I am completely satisfied with my product! Keep up the good service! I would buy from this seller again.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|You either love this film or hate it. I love this film. If you wish  to see a nightmare depicted on celluloid.....this is it. The images from this flick will kinda bounce around in your head for a while to come afterwards.<br /><br />This film also started the tradition of movie houses screening cult flicks at midnight, it actually premiered with a midnight screening! This film also what convinced Mel Brooks that Mr. Lynch was the right person for the job of directing the film version of _The Elephant Man_
B00006JSS8|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  It is a selection of the best songs I ever heard from Stevie Wonder.  The delivery was also very good.  I recommend this album.
B0001XALTG|5.0|The definitive edition of an amazing film.  An incredible view inside the twisted destructive lives of junkies.
044651652X|5.0|I saw the movie a few years ago, and was touched by the bittersweet love effectively portrayed by Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood on the screen, but the book was something else.. I guess we usually feel the book is better than the movie because we envision our own images when we read, and the movie dose'nt fit the images we have conjured up. I'm not ashamed to admit that my eyes filled up at least three or four times as I read the book, and I was touched, which I always feel is rewarding. Mr. Waller has a gift for expressing the purest, sweetest most unselfish of loves, and I sincerly thank him for writing such a beautiful story
B00005JNJT|4.0|Okay, yeah, it was only an okay film.  Maybe I was expecting too much after all the hype and I had my expectations too high.  It was definitely the grittiest of the Batman films and Christian Bale does an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne/Batman. <br /> <br />Liam Neeson is superb as Ducard and the character of the Scarecrow is great.  The hallucinations that people see while under the effects of Scarecrow are some of the best, intense special effects in the film.  Katie Holmes?...no! no! no!  Find someone much more suited to be an assistant D.A.!  She added zero value to the film. <br /> <br />The fight scenes at times were hard to follow.  Almost too much action and they always seemed to be a minute too long. <br /> <br />Overall though a good film that I would recommend seeing in the theater.

With one noteable exception (Northern Exposure) I have never seen a show with better writing, better acting, better story lines. This was a theatre-quality tv show and I'm so glad they made a movie out of it, ultimately. It is so well done that it makes me just sick that they quit making it and that reality tv is on instead. Every actor is perfect for their role, every story has integrity and hangs with the rest of the episodes perfectly. It is superb.
0060012358|5.0|As I have not yet read this particular book I am faithfully giving it 5 stars. The entire series of adventures are so entertaining that I recommend any one to read this book.  You would also enjoy \\"A Hatfull of Sky\\"
0141301155|5.0|I purchased this book to use with a student that I tutor in reading as part of a unit on chocolate.  She has loved reading it with me and is upset when we have to put it down.  I grew up with this book and have loved it ever since.  It truly has something for everyone and teaches some wonderful lessons (good and bad!).  This is a must read for anybody..not just children! <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard of Fire Fly I though, \\"Wow... how stupid.\\"  However, a good friend kept telling me how great it was (and he usually is right) so I bought it.  After the first episode all I could say was, \\"WOW!!!\\"  I love this series.  The characters are very realistic and the plot is well written.  This group of no name actors obviously loved what they were doing while they were shooting because there is passion.  Full of smart-alecky comments, fall out of your chair laughs, wild plot twists and fierce shoot outs... I say again, \\"WOW!!!\\"  I just hope this series gets picked back up for another season now that the Sci-Fi channel has picked it up. <br />
B000003T9B|5.0|I have been listening to Over Kill for ten years and I never get tired of listening to them even though I never get tired of listening to any of my bands.<br /><br />This album is pure original it just rules and it's also my favorite Over Kill album.Every song rules on the album,of course nothing beats the song Over Kill.<br /><br />Sonic Reducer is a cover song, much better by Over Kill.Bobby Blitz' voice is amazing,every Over Kill fan will agree.Bobby Gustafson does an awesome job on the guitar,D.D. Verni,awesome on the bass,'Rat' Skates awesome on the drums.Buy Over Kill's first five albums.<br /><br />Over Kill has some thrash in them,but mostly they are speed metal\\".
B000001FI7|5.0|[P] revolutionized the genre of trip-hop. <br />While they get their inspiration from various similar bands like Tricky, they totally blew them away with their innovation in the music. <br />When [P] left the scene people could only attempt to one-up them and most of the time they crashed horribly or was accused of biting [P]. <br />[P] truly caused a revolution and dare I say a new genre. <br /> <br />-Mikey
B000002W9P|5.0|This is a cd that everyone should have if you listen to metal,none of this other crap music.Michael Kiske is one of the best singers in metal,he has such an awesome voice.Kicking Michael Kiske out of the band was Helloween's biggest mistake because Helloween is nothing with out Michael Kiske.The album has an intro before the powerful song I'm Alive.Future World has crapy lyrics but the song still rules.The song Halloween is the best song on the album and ever by them and most people would agree,the song is 13:18.Buy this album and Pt.2 there only two good albums.
0441172717|5.0|I think this is the best book of Sci-Fi that I have ever read. It mixed ecology, politics, mental powers, and a lot of intrigues. It's full of \\"plans within plans\\". Probably the best choice I could have done.
6302732778|5.0|Walking home from class one day I pass by my local video rental store.  As luck would have it, it was the first day they were selling off their VHS library.  Curious, I step inside and browse around until I spot a title I've heard before but never really bothered checking out: Blade Runner the Director's Cut.  The combination of a futuristic film noir (two of my favorite genres) and one inspiration to Cowboy Bebop (one of my favorite series)? I decide to part with the 8 dollars.    Before watching the film I feel the need to find out a little more about my version.  Upon checking the reviews I run into a little debate over the better or best version.  As I understand (and to boil things down), the original version was the \\"Hollywood (forced/ feel good)\\" cut verses Mr. Scott's \\"own vision\\".  In addition, the DVD Director's cut is a 1st generation release (i.e. distracting/poor transfer quality).  So how was the VHS Director's Cut? Amazing.    From start to finish the film transports us into the gritty streets of a semi-advanced LA, planted in the classic 80's style.  The characters, driven through dimly lit environments and circumstances play very well together- from the decadent nightclubs to a monolithic corporation to apartment housing that mid 20th century forgot.  The music also fuses nicely, between jazz of a contemporary detective mystery and an 80's electronic orchestra, creating the synthesized trumpet that pulls me deeper into the night's chase.  And the performances? (You can read the product description for story) Well, without giving anything away, acting is never excessive, while subdued much of the time- as it needs to be.  It was those moments during the journeys, in between the confrontations that allowed time for the main characters to develop.  When sides did meet, the action was also very believable (like the settings).  In summary, the deliveries only built up until a great finish with an inspiring message to boot.       While that sale went on Ialso picked up a few other 80's VHS classics:    *Arcadia of my Youth- English Subtitled   Classic from the creator of Interstella 5555(which also has a certain dream-like quality).  'Arcadia' also has a strong positive message it wants to convey.      *Highlander- Original Cut(Heard director's cut is over explanitory.)  Another 80's fantastic adventure.    *Legend of Drunken Master II- English Subtitled (The complete version)  Early 90's but close enough.  For those who want more action and less plot. Jackie Chan in his prime...I'll check out 'Police Story' afterwards.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I think it's one of the Best movie of all time
B0000399WC|4.0|This review is for the 1999 Warner Brothers DVD.     The movie Papillon opens in France in the early 20th century.  The main character is a safecracking Frenchman named Henri 'Papillon' Charriere who was convicted of killing a pimp - a crime Papillon insists he was wrongfully accused of.  He is sentenced for life in prison in French Guiana.  During his voyage from France to South America, Papillon befriends another prisoner named Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman) who smuggled a small fortune of money with him.  Upon arriving in French Guiana, they find the conditions and the climate of prison camp extremely arduous and learn that many inmates die within the first year of imprisonment.  Together, Papillon and Dega combine their skills and resources for an escape from this prison colony.    The film is visually moving with many scenes showing the convicts in extremely hostile conditions.  The remote locations used were impressive - especially in this widescreen color format.  Steve McQueen gives the best performance of this career playing a prisoner who is subjected to near-death treatment is several parts of the film.  While his verbal communication is decent in this film, it's his physical presence that is absolutely remarkable.  Dustin Hoffman's performance is good, but nothing extra special. But overall, it's an extremely good adventure movie that should be about 130 minutes long instead of 2-1/2 hours.  All in all, it's an intriguing film, but I wasn't blown away by it.      As for the DVD, although the widescreen color and clarity are impressive, the film transfer did pickup some tiny blemishes throughout the movie.  For a 1973 film, it would have been nice to see a fully restored presentation of this picture.  The stereo audio quality is excellent.  There are only a few short bonus features.      Movie: B+    DVD Quality: B+
0446310786|5.0|One of the true classics in American litterature. A vivid slice of the harsh realities of life in the South during the 1930s. The book is filled with realisticaly interesting characters and scenarios expertly drawn by Harper Lee. A must read. The only dissapointing element is that it is the only novel I know of written by Harper Lee.
B0002IQNAG|3.0|First of all, I LOVE this film. I first saw it in the theaters not to long after it first came out. I wore out 3 vhs tapes of the movie. So for me to downgrade this movie at all is hard for me to do. <br />That being said...this movie is a pathetic way to get the fans to fork over their money for a whole lot of extras that aren't worth the price. <br />Why do we NEED three versions of the film? I bought the Divimax version which is almost 1/4 the price and I don't feel ripped off. I rented the 4 disc set and was disappointed. A lot of the extras were ridiculous and boring wastes of time. Does anyone REALLY want to walk around Monroeville mall with a group of fans who give you flashbacks to the Elvis groupies trotting through Graceland? And the home movies are scratchy and hard to understand. <br />You want to spend $40 on movies? Then spend the $12 for the Divimax version of Dawn and what the heck with the extra money...throw in the remake of Dawn. And you might have a little left over for soda and popcorn.
B00003CXCT|1.0|It's alaways the same, we,ve been waiting years for this to come out and when it does you think to yourself, shall i buy it.. <br />I have decided not to, not because i'm not a fan of Star Wars, it's because i'm fed up with, all the film companies releasing colections only to replace them with another special edition anniversary etc etc edition. <br />I know that Mr Lucas is going to put all 6 films in one super collection and when he does you can be sure thats the one I will buy, so people stand up to these people who keep bringing out different and better versions lets just keep it sensible. <br /> <br />P.S Bet the collection is in time for Christmas LOL !!!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I was looking for Wuthering Heights to share with my teenager son as he had to read the book for English Literature and I thought seeing it would make it more understandable. I picked this one over the wonderful classic with Sir Lawrence Olivier because the story line follows the book more closely. No movie follows a book perfectly but I appreciated that you could follow chapter by chapter. And yes, my son enjoyed it too.
6304698690|5.0|This to me is by far my favorite rendition of the classic. The acting, music and the scenery is so beautiful. This is definately a reccomendation to anyone who loves the story of The Secret Garden or loves anything that leaves a warm and fuzzy feeling after watching the movie.     I saw the 1987 Hallmark version and it didn't have the same feel as this one does. The acting was mediocre and it felt 'cold and unfeeling'. Don't get me wrong, the Hallmark version *is* a good movie. But compared to this one, it's completelly luke warm. I guess it's all in the matter of taste.     But as for this one, it's worth 5 stars a million times over.
B00005JNJT|1.0|Yes,this is who this 'movie' is geared for,those that have been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. It also helps if you 1.) are in the 13-25 yr. old demographic,and 2.) have no sense of movie history. <br /> <br />   Folks,if you haven't seen this 'Bat movie',and are planning to,then before you do,watch the following movies: <br /> <br />           Batman '89 <br />           Batman Returns <br />           Batman Forever <br />           the Shadow (with Alec Baldwin) <br />           Spider-Man <br />       any James Bond movie <br /> <br />    Nolan,and Goyer totally steal/rip-off concepts from all of the above mentioned movies,and they do not even try to be subtle about it. <br /> <br />     Batman '89: black rubber suit,villian is responsible for the death of Bruce's parents hence motivation for being Batman is resolved,and over the top Batmobile. <br />     Batman Begins: rip off of Batman '89. <br />     Batman Returns: black rubber suit,'glider-cape',and stun gun is used to defeat one of the villians. <br />     Batman Begins: rip off of Batman Returns. <br />     Batman Forever: Two different rubber suits,and Bruce makes peace/accepts being Batman as a choice,no longer 'captive' to the 'ghosts' of his parents' death. <br />     Batman Begins: rip off of Batman Forever (pay attention to Kilmer's second suit,compare that to Bale's suit...hmmmmmm... <br />Also,does Bale wear some type of second suit [perhaps slight modification]? Pay attention to last scene of Begins. <br />     the Shadow: Begins rips off the beginning of the Shadow for the idea of Bruce's training. <br />     Spider-Man: Begins rips off Spider-Man's resolution for its' love story. <br />     James Bond: Begins rips off the Bond/Q relationship in order for Bruce to come upon his 'Bat stash'. <br /> <br />     Folks,you have read/heard about how awful the action scenes are edited,yes? It gets worse! The non-action scenes are truly edited for the ADD/ADHD crowd. (I suspect that Nolan was a huge fan ofMTV while growing up.) <br /> <br />     Bale,you had a chance to be a great Bat,but thanks to the awful script,and editing you never had a chance. You are,sadly,in the same boat that Clooney found himself in. <br /> <br />     In time,this movie will be revisited,and acknowledged for the pointless waste that it is. <br /> <br />     Alan Horn,you greenlighted this piece of dreck. You should be ashamed. <br /> <br />     Folks,one more thing. What do all the previous Bat movies have in common? Big 'over the top' endings. What does Begins have? A big 'over the top' ending,and that is the last thing you should have for when Batman is just beginning!
6304698623|5.0|This movie is wonderful! It's even better than (gulp) Shirley Temple's rendition. That's saying alot because I grew up with this movie. And Shirley Temple is such a landmark in film history that you can't go wrong with her.  <br />I didn't see this version until it was out on video/DVD. I loved it!! I was sad to hear that it didn't do too well in the box-office. To me it's sad because less and less people are appreciating these classics. Parents, please teach your children while they're still young to appreciate these classics. My parents did exactly that and I can't thank them enough.  <br /> <br />Watch this version and then Shirley Temple's, you can't go wrong with either one of them. :)
B000002KDO|4.0|Very good era of the black sabbath's with Ozzy Osbourne.<br /><br />I listened the lyricks especially they are fit Today and the songs remains the same.
0553381687|5.0|I advise anyone who is thinking about it to buy these books. Martin writes with intrigue and suspense, and the characters are in all fairness the most unique I have ever had the pleasure to read. Pick it up!
B00008MZ0N|1.0|You know something I notice with movies directed by Rob Cohen that have Vin Diesel in them? NONE of them have real plots in them; they are all more of crowd pleasers. This is no exception. If you like visuals, you will love this movie. But if you are looking for some actual good action movies, I suggest you look elsewhere (lots of recommended titles that I'd rather not list). Really, I found it hard to just keep on watching this because there's nothing that made me think \\"Wow!\\" when I was amazed, except that so many people actually wanted to see this. Although I don't necessarily recommend it either, XXX also is quite lame and is more about seeing the explosion than an actual coherent story. I don't think I'd want to shell out money for this. <br /> <br />On the good side, \\"Sin City\\" just came out a couple days ago.
B000000XB9|5.0|Most people have, at one time or the other, heard these CCR songs played either in movies or on the radio.  This band had so many great songs and this is the album to get as an entry point into some great R&R.  What's interesting to note is how well these songs have held up during all these years.  They just haven't gotten old and tired.  This album deserves a listen and is well worth adding to any music collection.
B000006NPY|5.0|Yes, you read right. Following \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\", the Smashing Pumpkins had a lot of ups and downs. Following Jimmy Chamberlin's addiction which got him temporarily kicked out of the Pumpkins, they didn't know how they continue, but in the end did just that. It is true that Chamberlin does not appear on here and that he is an amazing drummer, but what's done here is what to accept. And it's really, really good. Did you like the two songs from \\"Batman & Robin\\" and \\"Eye\\" from \\"Lost Highway\\"? Well, then you will probably really like this album. It's not really as quiet as others would have you think. <br /> <br />And I think today that some of the people who originally loathed this album laugh now at their sentiments, because if you're not used to what's here, you're just going to have to wait to let it sink in. And it's 100% worth it. People who like music done by people who like doing music like the Smashing Pumpkins. And I think Billy's voice sounds great here. <br /> <br />It starts very nicely with the acoustic fingerpick \\"To Sheila\\", which also has this nice percussive atmosphere in the verses. The melody is just really, really good. The track is a little bit less than five minutes yet the point is well done. The bridge is just perfect (no pun intended). Then things go into an actual rocking track, \\"Ava Adore\\". Nice instrumentation, and the only song with an actual guitar solo here. More guitar was actually done live, but on here it just sounds really cool. The gothic influence is not only shown in the music video but on this album, partially with this particular song. It's still more of a heavy trip-hop track. It's a wonder it wasn't bigger than it was. Then you get things in the pop territory a la \\"1979\\" with \\"Perfect\\". However, this one's about ups and downs where the other one was just carefree and this one's also probably a lot more new wave. It is also a nice balance of electronica and rock, as is the next song, \\"Daphne Descends\\", which is notable for its bridge. <br /> <br />That's not even close to the end of the excitement on \\"Adore\\". You get a nice acoustic tribute to Billy's deceased grandma on \\"Once Upon a Time\\", which is more acoustic than many probably expected. Then comes in \\"Tear\\", which has orchestration via keyboards, done really well. The melody is great even though the programming is a bit hard to handle in the first couple listens, which is pretty much the meat and bones of the verses. But it gets better with time. I think it may be one of the greatest Pumpkins songs made, and that's saying a lot. <br /> <br />\\"Crestfallen\\" is a Depeche Mode type piano pop song, then it follows to the electronica of that band and New Order's style in \\"Appels + Oranjes\\". I think I read that the misspelling was so people wouldn't think it was a Pink Floyd cover. But it's the only song here that fully embraces the electronica, so if you're expecting that, just listen to this. I liked it so much it inspired the screen name I have on AOL. \\"Pug\\" is a really unique track, and I don't know anything else to say about that one. <br /> <br />Then comes a couple of stream-of-consciousness tracks of great Billy Corgan poetry; the former is a lesser track while the latter is a nice piano track which was unchanged from its demo. About the only problem on the album is that \\"Shame\\" is a bit long, but it's still a pretty good song. The guitar part is pretty repetitive though. You do get to hear some bass playing from D'arcy, though. <br /> <br />Then you get into a trilogy of pure greatness. \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\" has some distortion but in more of a nighttime/goth type of way. It is great for if you like goth. Also, a quite unique track on the album. It gets a bit interesting in its atmospheres and also when it just goes on the simple playing in the bridge. Following that is \\"For Martha\\" which is over eight minutes, a great tribute to Billy's mom. It's very peaceful in its piano and the chorus is just plain magical. This one is the length it is for a reason. Then it's the full-on piano ballad, \\"Blank Page\\". The piano could've maybe been written a little bit better, but it is still a pretty good song. I really like Billy's melody in this track. It may be hard to believe for some, but Billy's voice and the piano together sound really good. <br /> <br />It isn't just for \\"hardcore fans\\". While some may argue that I'm one, I didn't exactly say that \\"Machina\\" was pristine in quality. It's also for goths and people who would prefer the Pumpkins doing more \\"quiet\\" tracks. But it's really not that quiet, save for a few moments in the album. But it is unmistakably a Pumpkins record. Billy still has a lot of ambition and fuel in him on here. It also was a matured point from some of what was on the previous records. Play this album in the autumn and you'll feel like it's the soundtrack to that particular time.
B000059HB7|5.0|Howard Hawks' answer to \\"High Noon\\" with John Wayne playing the Sheriff.  He's caught up between a rock and a hard spot.  Arresting the brother, Claude Akins, of a rich rancher, John Russell, for murder and then trying to hold on to him against all odds.  Helping is a ragtag bunch of misfits. A washed up drunk, Dean Martin, an old codger, Walter Brennan, gun for hire, Ricky Nelson and Wayne's love interest, Angie Dickinson.  Together they make their stand.<br /><br />High Noon had the sheriff running about looking for help, shooting the badguy and then throwing his badge in the dust and leaving the 'not worth saving' town.  Here we have John Wayne standing his ground with 'What he's got'...(Personally I don't think Hawks and Wayne liked the idea of an out-of-control sheriff).  With the Deguello, Santa Anna's song at the Alamo, playing from the bar down the street, the tension builds toward their final shootout.  There are moments in everyone's life when you can't pull up stakes and run.  You have to make a stand for justice or you can never really feel clean again.<br /><br /> This is a great movie for examining the need for friendship, loyalty and the self respect that comes from standing for a principle.  Dean, Ricky and Walter even get to sing.  Interspersed with comedy and emotion, this is a movie that can be savored again and again.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I'm sorry to say the last part but that is what I honestly feel. Maybe the audience of this album isn't necessarily for someone like me. I like songs that can be \\"more quiet\\" as well (look at my review for \\"Adore\\" by the Smashing Pumpkins). It just seems to me like what is done here is just kind of, well, average. That's not to say that there aren't moments I like listening to on \\"Morning View\\", there are. I mean, I think it's pretty good, but it doesn't leave much playback value or aftertaste. <br /> <br />Songs that I particularly enjoy the whole way through include the excellent single \\"Warning\\" which should pretty much be heard by EVERYONE. I like the progression of the chords on the outro in particular. The message is good and turns out to be unpretentious. I enjoy other tracks, but not nearly to that extent. It seems that the really good tracks don't come until late in the album. For instance, it ends well with \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" which is unique for bands that they are compared to. I like the somewhat stream-of-consciousness lyrics as well. There are a lot of times here though that I respect the ideas a lot more than I actually enjoy the record. <br /> <br />This reminds me of listening to \\"Good News...\\" by Modest Mouse in that both records, while praised among new fans, don't really do a whole lot for me. I don't think that this is bad at all, but it seems like a lot of other bands do similar ideas and pull it off in a more convincing way. And yes, to me, 3 stars is actually a favorable opinion.
0671027387|4.0|After reading \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I went looking for more. Dan Brown has a writing style that keeps you in suspense and has you always wanting to read just a few more pages. \\"Deception Point\\" was almost as good, but when I was through I couldn't help but feel as though his writing is a little formulaic. All in all, still a great read.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My last girlfriend played the Original London Cast soundtrack incessantly in our living room. I saw the play twice. Once with Crawford and once with Guillaume. I thought it was okay for a broadway musical and even though I knew a lot of the words by heart, I always thought her obsession for THE PHANTOM was a bit extreme. But, nothing would prepare me for the emotional impact of seeing this musical brought to the screen. It knocked me out BIG TIME. This film is emotional dynamite. Especially the roof scene and the ending.<br /><br />I think the reason so many fans of THE PHANTOM say they like the movie better is that film is a very visual and personal medium. The space and remoteness of a stage is completely done away with when a musical is brought to the widescreen. We get to share in the actors emotional reactions to the singing that they project. I was raised on MGM musicals and have always preferred them to stage musicals. Even though some of the excitement of the LIVE event is lost while viewing a film. This is not the case with the film version of THE PHANTOM. It's BREATHTAKING to say the least. I was also able to understand almost every word in the film version, while I only understood about 2 thirds of the vocal articulation of the stage play. And unlike the play, I was completely MOVED the first, second, and third viewing of the film. And now I'm just as obsessed with PHANTOM as my girlfriend was. OH, GOD!! I'M GAY!!<br /><br />This has now become my second favorite film musical following WEST SIDE STORY, while knocking SINGING IN THE RAIN into a distance third place. THIS FILM IS THAT GOOD!! It's so lavish and beautiful to look at, I'm completely at a loss as to why it didn't win Best Picture, let alone to not even be nominated for it. PLEASE!! This was hands down the BEST FILM OF 2004. If Mr. Peabody sent us back to the 40'S, 50's, or 60's in his Wayback Machine when musicals were beloved, this film would have captured at least some of the 10 Oscars that went to WEST SIDE STORY in 1960. It's just as moving as that film. And unlike those old Marny Nixon dubbed vocal days, almost all of the cast do their own singing. Amazing!! MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a great film, but this is an INSTANT CLASSIC!! In ten years time, most people will have forgotten that film, but I'm sure I'll be viewing THIS every Sunday night, (which is now WEST SIDE STORY night in my house,) for years to come. Man, Hollywood sure has changed.<br /><br />In one of the Documentary Features on the 2 Disc DVD, Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that this was the way he always envisioned his PHANTOM. I agree!! He must be stoked!! I'M TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY!!<br /><br />BRAVO, MR. WEBBER and MR. SCHUMACHER!! BRAVO, CAST AND CREW!! BRAVO!!<br /><br />SIGNED, A CONVERTED PHANTOM FAN.<br /><br />OH, GOD!!

B000050FEN|5.0|Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Lust, Envy, Pride, and Wrath. The topic of the Seven Deadly sins has been around for centuries, but with David Fincher's 1995 thriller, it is made into a topic that stays branded in the human mind even after the credits roll.  <br /> <br />This psychological thriller is about a detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his newly acquired partner Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), who have to hunt down a serial killer who is killing people according to the seven deadly sins. At first, the killer, nicknamed John Doe, seems to be just a madman, but as the killings start to become more and more violent, the detectives and the viewers discover that this killer is smart, clever, sinister, and patient. John Doe has marked his reputation as one of the most evil villans in cinematic history. From the movie's beginning, to its shocking twisted ending, David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker(writing credits) make a fantastic pair in exposing the world to the imperfection of human emotion and psyche. 5 stars. <br /> <br />
B0007M22TI|4.0|I hate having to give this excellent DVD 4 starts, but I just want to hear more of that fiddle player then it gets 5 for sure. <br /> <br />While I ilike all the girls voices, it's when they perform together that the magic really happens, and when the fiddle player starts to play those fast reels I just wanted to dance around the room. And I'm 53 so that's quite something. My wife thinks I have gone mad. My Irish roots was long lost but now I feel like going back to Ireland again and reliving it. <br /> <br />Also trying to find if the fiddle player has a solo album but doesn't seem to be one on Amazon.
B00005JNSK|4.0|When word that Tim Burton would be developing \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" the skepticism between critics and viewers set in. \\"Would it be as good as the original?\\" Considering its \\"the year of the remakes\\" it was at first just labeled another remake. However, it is not a remake. \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" just happen to have been based on the same story. The story of a poverty-stricken boy who finds a golden ticket inside a chocolate bar and wins a trip to Wonka's fantastic and weird chocolate factory is a story that is full of laughs, and also some touching moments.  <br /> <br />Instead of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka,(his was more of a calm but mad kind of Wonka), the risk-taking actor Johnny Depp portrays the eccentric Willy Wonka. Most were afraid that he would not be able to live up to the legendary Wilder, but if anything, Wilder should be kissing Depp's boots. Depp's portayl  represents Wonka with splendid acting ability, and an uncanny resembelance to Michael Jackson. The rest of the cast do their parts beautifully. <br /> <br />However, the movie in some minds still stands in the shadow of the first one. Half-expecting the Oompa Loompas to break out into the famous tune, you end up expecting too much and getting a little less. For those who haven't seen the first one, you won't be in for disappointment. That is the only downside of the film. Otherwise, Tim Burton does a fantastic job giving credit to the book and making a fun family movie (or for Depp fans). <br /> <br />That is why I give this movie 4 stars. If it weren't for the first one, it would of been 5. But it is still not a remake. It is an adaptation. That is forgotten.  <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|4.0|Whether you want to admit it or not, the fact still remains that Britney Spears is truly a pop music icon; with over sixty-million albums sold worldwide and numerous #1 singles around the globe in only six short years, it's no wonder why Jive decided it was time for her to release a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. <br /> <br />This release was probably smart of her management, too, seeing as her star power is waning and by next year (though as much as I hate to admit it) she'll probably be considered a full-fledged \\"has-been.\\" Despite this, there is no denying Spears' impact on pop culture; she is easily the most famous artist of her generation (and again, whether you want to admit this fact or not) is truly a music legend. <br /> <br />Oh, and to all the nay-sayers out there, believe-it-or-not, Britney has taken much more creative control over her music since the release of 2003's \\"In the Zone.\\" She actually writes and produces many of her own songs nowadays, so that excuse for a reason of how much she \\"sucks\\" is dried up.

B0009A40ES|2.0|This movie is horrendous in comparison to the book.  If you've read the book and really enjoy it, stay away from the flick.  Several key events are omitted, the acting is poor, and the movie does not draw the audience in like the book does.  The movie is corny and not believable. <br /> <br />Pretending I have not read the book, I would still give the movie 2-3 stars, for the lack of good acting or pacing.
B000002UA9|5.0|Picture this:     One afternoon after school, you take a walk to you local record shop. You walk over to the counter, and ask the salesman - \\"Do you have that new record by the Beatles?\\"     And the salesman smiles, and says: \\"Sure do, son; got a new shipment today. They've been selling like hot cakes\\".    And you give him 75p (or whatever a record cost back then) and he hands you the record. And you go home, and close the door to your room, and place the record on your gramophone, and place the needle on the record.    And you hear a click and some hisses, and then a young man with a heavy Liverpoolian accent yells out \\"One, two, three, four!\\", and an electric guitar starts playing. And your life is changed forever.    It may be, as Jack Black's character in High Fidelity would say, painfully obvious and trite to say it, but 'I Saw Her Standing There' is still one of the best opening tracks on a rock album, ever. Even now, with all the distance the music business had come, it's hard to resist the sheer contagiousness of the song's rhythm and of Paul's youthful energy. Even though the song shows heavy influences of the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and especially Little Richard - who were, of course, among the Beatles' idols - the observant listener could have heard even then, in 1963, that this was something new, something that would change the course of musical history. The true British rock n' roll was born with Please Please Me.    Although I was born a full two decades after this album was released, so I can only guess at the thrill of hearing the Beatles for the first time, back then, that is without all the myth and glamour that have been attached to them in the years since; and although I know, like everybody knows, that the Beatles created their best music after 1965, right about the time they quite touring; and despite the dated sound quality and all the other flaws that it has - flaws that are inherent in a recording made by a band where the oldest member is twenty three, at basically zero budget, in less than twenty hours, with a classical music producer working as engineer and a record shop owner working as a manager; despite all that, Please Please Me is an album that never fails to astound and amaze me. Though the sound is certainly dated, it stands the test of time like few albums from the 70s and 80s do, and appeals in so many different levels.    Lennon and McCartney were at this point not entirely confident in their abilities as songwriters - they rely heavily on cover versions to their own favorite songs - but the few originals that they did write for the album - other than the opening track and the title track there are also 'Love Me Do', 'P.S. I Love You', 'Ask Me Why', 'Misery', 'There's a Place' and 'Do You Want to Know a Secret', performed by twenty year old George Harrison - are all classics, and some of the cover versions are also worthy of praise - especially John's unforgettable delivery of 'Twist and Shout', which became one of their most popular songs and left the original version far behind.    It's difficult to let go of everything you know about the last forty years and listen to an album in the context of its own time, but if, for the thirty-something minutes of Please Please Me you can close your eyes, lay back, and pretend that it's 1963, you're in your room, with the door closed and that record spinning away... You'll enjoy it so much more. It may be true that the Beatles created their best music after 1965, but don't pass the old albums by, especially not Please Please Me, which has a unique and undisputed place in the history books... and with good cause.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Sin City is indeed a five-star film-but knowing that this DVD doesn't have all the goodies that the special edition will have, this one's good for a rent. The movie is very faithful to the comics in terms of character design, atmosphere, and even dialogue, which is quite a nice first! The music didn't really seem fitting at first (you wouldn't expect to hear raspy saxophones at the beginning of an ultra-violent movie based on an ultra-violent comic), but eventually, it really blends in with the dark, gory atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />But boy, if you take anyone under 15 to see it (I'm 16), you will live to regret it. It is SO violent, SO intense, that those with weak stomachs will not even be able to bear the soundtrack's hard jazz saxophone grunts and techno beats or the unrelenting violence that lasts throughout a vast majority of the two-hour film.<br /><br />One of the big plusses in the film is that even with such insane amounts of violence, it has a PLOT, not to mention the fact that it has a star-studded cast, filled with men that make girls cream and chicks that make boys (like me) salivate. And by that, I don't just mean Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The men that make girls drool include Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood (aka Frodo Baggins), Josh Hartnett. Clive Owen, and, for those older ones out there, Mickey Rourke and Michael Clarke Duncan. As for the chicks that make us guys drool, you got Carla Gugino, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls), Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba. All of them, among many others. Also, fans of Japanese animation from ADV Films should know Jason Douglas, who does a good job on screen as a hitman.<br /><br />Also notable is that the film really does well illustrating the atmosphere of the comic. For the most part, the film is in black and white, but certain color effects are used (in some instances) for eyes, blood, and (in one case) skin.<br /><br />But once more, take note: do NOT show this film to a child or watch it when a child is awake in the house it is being viewed in, and do NOT watch it if you are the squeamish type, it is the most intense, unrelentingly violent film I have EVER viewed. However, with that said, I can safely say this: it's a five star film, but a four star DVD. Wait for the special edition, and rent this for now.a child or watch it when a child is awake in the house it is being viewed in, and do NOT watch it if you are the squeamish type, it is the most intense, unrelentingly violent film I have EVER viewed.

B000063COX|5.0|This one helped to open up the doors for what was to come.. And for a few years what was to come was awesome.  I was torn between 4 and 5 stars, only because Killers and Powerslave are a little better, but how can you not give this 5 stars.<br /><br />This is Maiden at their unrefined raw best.  Again, you have to put this album into its proper perspective.  In 1980-1981 there wasn't ANYTHING like this around.  Yeah you had some Metal, but this was different.<br /><br />Priest was releasing Point of Entry (Screaming for Vengeance was coming), the Scorps had just released Animal Magnetism (one of their best ever.. Blackout wasn't out yet).  Def Leppard was releasing On through the Night and High and Dry (before totally selling out).. Sabbath was teaming up with Dio for 2 decent albums...<br /><br />Then came Maiden... Maiden took the new look British Metal and added a Black Sabbath bass (just listen to Sanctuary) to it and bam.. There it was, metal at its best shoved right down your throat.  You almost didn't know what to make of it, but you loved it.<br /><br />Yeah Paul Di'anno wasn't as accomplished as Bruce Dickinson, and yeah Maiden would mature as song writers, but that was a couple years down the road.. In 1980-81 what we had was \\"Iron MAiden' and we loved it.  From the moment you looked at the Album cover while listening to the first chords of Prowler, until the last song faded out, this was METAL, and it was great.<br /><br />Yeah you wondered what they were thinking when they wrote Charlotte the Harlot, and in later years you would wonder why Dickinson continued to butcher 'Running Free' by adding that idiotic audience participation part, but when you listened to Prowler, Sanctuary, Transylvania and Strange World you just had to love it.<br /><br />Maiden opened the doors for the brief onslaught that followed, unfortunately too many of the bands (Leppard, Scorps, Priest) decided that there was some money to be made in power ballads, opening up the door for the hair bands..<br /><br />Is this the best Maiden Album, probably not, it falls right behind Killers and Powerslave, but before you go and 'follow the herd' and buy the overated 'Number of The Beast', do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD.  You will then know where it all began.um, probably not, it falls right behind Killers and Powerslave, but before you go and 'follow the herd' and buy the overated 'Number of The Beast', do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD.

B000077VR3|1.0|I can't even begin to fathom what the members of the Academy were thinking.  This is probably the second worst film ever produced (the first being that waste of celluloid \\"Showgirls\\").  I enjoyed the performances, particularaly Kidman's, but that does NOT a good film make.  Disjointed, poorly written, extremely poorly edited.  I can't say enough bad about this film.
B00000J2SQ|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Richie Blackmore's Rainbow, and one of my favorite road trip CD's is \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\" but this will probably always be my favorite Rainbow Album. After a somewhat poor showing on \\"Difficult to Cure\\" this album put Rainbow right back where it belonged.<br /><br />All you have to do is go to the 'listen to samples' section and listen to a few seconds of each song.  It is amazing how great these songs are.  Yeah Miss-mistreated is weak, but Eyes of Fire is better then the sample indicates. And yes as one reviewer pointed out, some of songs are similiar to earlier Rainbow/Deep Purple material, but so what, this albums kicks @$$. Is it as 'Classic' as the stuff with DIO.. No.. but it is an awesome hard rock album.<br /><br />Starting off with Death Alley Driver, it just never lets up.  'Power' is absolutely amazing, as is Rock Fever.  Turner's vocals, while ill-suited for earlier Rainbow Material, are perfect for this album.  And Blackmore Illustrates that while he can be technically sound, he can also just plug in and jam.<br /><br />Back in 'the good ol' days', before CD's, DVD's MP's and walkman's, we had cassettes.  For $2.00 you could get a TDK-90 which had 45 minutes on each side.  The albums were shorter then, so you could fit an album on each side.  Our #1 party tape was 'Straight Between the Eyes' on side A, and Riot's Fire Down Under (probably the greatest hard rock album ever released) on side B. This tape went with us to every concert we went to. It didn't matter who was in concert, this is what we tailgated to. (You should have seen the looks we got at the Tiffany concert)<br /><br />Unfortunately (for Die Hard Rainbow fans anyway) Rainbow was to release only one more album, the totally inept 'Bent Out of Shape' before breaking up when Deep Purple reunited (who can forget the Perfect Strangers tour?).<br /><br />So if you're looking for a 'Clasic' Rainbow album, get one of the ones with DIO on vocals, but if you just want to crank something, BUY STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES.. You won't regret it.BETWEEN THE EYES.. You won't regret it.
6305181772|2.0|The only great thing about Mission Impossible (1996) directed by Brian De Palma and staring Tom Cruise and John Voight is the updating of the theme song. The new theme song was great. It's true the film had a lot of plot holes, but that's only one thing that bothered me when I saw it on the big screen. The plot was completely loused up. The beginning was the worst. Never have I seen a movie where the entire original team of anything is killed off two minutes into the movie. The entire IMF team is killed two minutes into the movie leaving pretty boy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as the only survivor. Ethan Hunt is the disguise expert of the force. This is the second thing that bothers me. Wasn't Paris played by Leonard Nimoy aka Spok always the one with the clever disguises on the team? I hate when movie makers take hold of an already good idea and twist and mold it into nothing, like creating new characters. They did it with Charlie's Angels (2000). What happened to Jill, Sabrina and Kelly? Sure one of the original characters makes a cameo in the sequel. Remember the motto: If it aint broke, don't fix it. This is completely ignored every time a studio makes a big budget production based on a classic TV series in my opinion (The Mod Squad). Now the nitty gritty of why I was disappointed with this film. What the film makers did to Jim Phelps (John Voight) is villainess and a crime! Jim Phelps is the leader right?! I have no idea what David Koepp, Steven Zaillian, and Robert Towne were thinking when they wrote this. This movie is all about Cruise, Cruise, and Cruise who co-produced. A better title would be Tom Cruise and the Mission. I love Brain De Palma's work especially The Untouchables and Phantom of the Paradise. However, he really jumped the gun. The supporting cast played their parts well and I give De Palma credit for trying.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Why must everyone overanalyze this movie?? For starters, does everything have to make sense to be funny?? Heck no. I laughed the second Napoleon came on the screen and kept laughing til the end. The hilarious things in this movie are more about stupid humor, which is fine by me. The problem with many of today's movies is that they think they need to have sex jokes and cuss words to be funny. This movie shows that you can be funny just being stupid. I am 20 years old and I am immature. I laughed at this movie until I cried. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.  <br /> <br />Aside from the side splitting laughter, this movie also has it's tender moments. You will probably cry when you see Trisha leave Napoleon at the dance...I did. And when Deb and Napoleon dance together, it just looks right.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but go see the movie. If you're a fan of crazy, stupid, humor........BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!

0061020710|4.0|THE COLOR OF MAGIC was an interesting book, but I didn't feel that it kept up the same level of consistent high quality as the latest offerings from the series that I've read recently (e.g. GOING POSTAL and NIGHTWATCH).  That being said, I found the first part of the book to be top-notch - maybe even better than the later books... I especially liked the barroom altercation scenes, and some of the names of the bars from Ankh-Morpork, like THE STAB IN THE BACK.<br /><br />The middle part of the book was decent enough, involving lots of magic and fantasy - but this continues without much change in the latter part of the book, which doesn't contain a lot of stuff that \\"makes you laugh\\", which I've come to expect from Pratchett's later works.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a good book, and a decent kick-off to the series.<br /><br />A friend at work, to whom I lent his first Pratchett Discworld book, has become a Discworld fanatic, and is ripping his way thru the series, tossing me the books he finishes along the way... so,  I've got quite a queue of Discworld paperbacks stacked up, and I'm looking forward to moving on to EQUAL RITES next.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Fristly, I gave this album 4 stars, despite really enjoying it.  5 star ratings are given to a select few, generally speaking. <br /> <br />Now onto the album.  I have read many reviews on here about how the vocals \\"suck\\" and are nothing like the previous albums.  Guess what?  These people are semi-correct.  The vocals are very different from the last 2 albums, but not on purpose.  I won't say they suck, because I like them enough to give this album 4 stars.  It's not like A7x decided to just change up their vocal style for the hell of it. <br /> <br />Shadows lost his range from surgery, so what is a guy supposed to do?  With that said, I am not going to give him any slack just because he had surgery.  Are the vocals nasaly/whiny at times?  Yes, but not as often as some make it out to be.  If anything, the vocals are more scratchy/scruffy than nasaly.  It makes me wonder what they will put out next once he is able to control his voice even better?  Hmmmm...... <br /> <br />The nasaly vocals are more noticeable on Burn it Down in the chorus, but overall he is not that nasaly nor whiny.  There is no screaming/growling as in previous albums, but don't let that deter you from checking this album out.  As other reviewers said, it grows on you after a few listens.  But if you absolutely need some screaming, then don't buy this album. <br /> <br />I am VERY picky about vocals and easily got past Shadows' vocals in this album.  In fact, I was somewhat intrigued by the vocals.  He still does a good enough job to make this a great listen.   <br /> <br />But what REALLY steals the show are the guitar arrangements and the fast paced drums.  Overlaying the guitars throughout the album really appealed to me and the percussions were extremely solid.  We aren't talking Mastodon-type drumming here, but fast, pounding beats that keep your feet tapping that dummy pedal in your car and keep your head nodding like a yes-man in W's cabinet. <br /> <br />Beyond this, A7x introduces somedifferent sounds into some songs, such as some Spanish-style guitar arrangements.  You could imagine what that would sound like on electric guitar because you can detect that A7x gusto in the arrangement, which is interesting. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really good rock album.  The musical arrangements are great and the vocals are not that bad and at times very good.  In fact, it is refreshing to hear something that is not non-stop screaming.  It's cool to like screaming and growling (I'd be a hypocrite if I dissed this vocal style), but a little melody can be a good thing.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I highly recommend Cry-Baby to those who enjoy musicals and/or the work of Johnny Depp.  I also recommend this movie to people who typically do not like musicals because they find musicals to be too \\"campy\\".  This movie actually mocks the campiness of musicals in a light-hearted and humorous way.  The music itself is rockabilly, a mix of early rock and country.  The story takes place in Baltimore in the 1950's.  Johnny Depp plays Wade \\"Cry-Baby\\" walker, a Drape (Baltimore's version of a Greaser) and lead singer/ guitarist of a rockabilly band.  Cry-Baby and a Square named Allison, played by Amy Locane, fall in love.  The problem is that Allison already has a boyfriend.  Like Allison, her boyfriend is a Square and becomes very jealous of Cry-Baby.  Of course, the inevitable happens: the two classes of people, the Drapes and Squares, wind up fighting.  Do Cry-Baby and Allison wind up together?  You'll have to watch the movie to find out!  You should also check out the bonus features, which include the following: \\"It Came From Baltimore\\" (commentary from the director John Waters and the cast), optional commentary during the movie by John Waters, and deleted scenes.  Caution to those who care about ratings: the \\"F\\" word is mentioned three times in non-sexual ways.  There is also a lot of sexual humor, such as a scene in which couples are shown so closely that you can see all the moves they make with their tongues.  In other words, this movie barely squeeked by with a PG-13 rating.  Young teens might have a lot of questions about behavior and slang terms...  The bonus features are definitely \\"R\\" rated.  But anyway, I loved this movie and keep hearing that it will become a Broadway musical.  I can't wait!  Now, if only we could get Mr. Depp to go on Broadway for a season or two...  Hmmm...
B00007KQKM|4.0|Good product.  Has met up to my expectation from Amazon.  Thank you.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Former Nirvana member Dave Grohl, lead singer of the Foo Fighters, attacks the vocals on disc #1 of IN YOUR HONOR with his usual visceral intensity, backed by blistering guitar work and attack-mode rhythm tracks. These guys know their way around a musical hook or two, and they aren't afraid to give it all they've got, even when the lyrics themselves would have very little to say if you took away all the overly-dramatic poetic death metaphors. Terrific performances with few surprises...so far, so good.<br /><br />But the real gems on this album are on disc #2, a quieter and sweeter Yang to disc #1's Yin. Listen for flamenco guitar and delicate piano on \\"Virginia Moon,\\" a duet with Norah Jones in which Grohl gets to croon romantic Hallmark-worthy poetry to a Bossa Nova beat. Another track, \\"Miracle,\\" features Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, and \\"Cold Day in the Sum\\" gives drummer Taylor Hawkins a shot at lead vocals. It feels like everyone involved is stretching -- taking musical chances that mostly end up working out well.<br /><br />There's a feeling of immediacy and honesty in these quieter tracks that somehow trumps the big loud stuff on Disc #1, maybe only because it comes as such a surprise, but maybe because this is where the heart of the album lies. Whatever the reason, it works like a charm.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I must admit. When I first put this cd in my player I had, as I'm sure many of you did, some very high expectations. And when the first riff roared out of my speakers, I was pumped. Ready for what lay beneath. A whole new a7x experience just waiting to be heard. Then came the first chorus of 'Beast and the Harlot'. I was taken back. So I immediately skipped to the next track. Likewise, the sound was not entirely what I had planned it to be. This practice continued and I soon found myself very disappointed. Another great band has lost it. So I set the cd to the side. After listening to waking the fallen one night i decided to give city of evil another shot. It couldn't be that bad, right? And the thing is, it wasn't. It isn't. As a matter of fact, its pretty damn good. I don't know where i missed it at first. I think if you go into this thinking it's waking the fallen 2, you'll think its crap. Admittedly, shadows' vocals, which are mostly great throughout, can come off a bit nasally and whiny at times and there seems to be just a slight need for the screams of albums past on some tracks, but this shouldn't deter anyone from picking up this cd. Stand out tracks inlude #2, 3, 5, 7, 8.  All others are very agreeable, but not as memorable. Give it a shot. It WILL grow on you.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Hey everyone who believed the so-called \\"science\\" used for this movie, better think again.  I copied this article to show that most scientists and actual data do not support the crackpot \\"greenhouse effect\\".  You may not believe me but read for yourself.    Is the debate now over for skeptics of global warming hysteria? Readers of USA Today may certainly have that impression.     \\"Satellite and weather-balloon research released today removes a last bastion of scientific doubt about global warming, researchers say,\\" reported USA Today on Aug.12. 2005.  Certainly the USA Today report was partially correct - the researchers did, in fact, \\"say\\" [read \\"claim\\"] that \\"the last bastion of scientific doubt\\" had been removed. But claims and reality often don't match up.    Three papers published in the journal Science last week purport to debunk an important argument advanced by skeptics of the notion of catastrophic, manmade global warming. The skeptics' argument is that while temperatures measured on the Earth's surface seem to indicate that global temperatures have increased at a rate of about 0.20 degrees Centigrade per decade (deg. C/decade) since the 1970s, temperatures measured in the atmosphere by satellite and weather balloons have shown only a relatively insignificant amount of warming for the same time period (about 0.09 deg. C/decade).    The implication of the skeptics' argument is that whatever warming seems to be happening on the Earth's surface, similar warming isn't happening in the atmosphere. This might mean that any observed surface warming is more likely due to the urban heat island effect -- where the heat-retaining properties of concrete and asphalt in urban areas artificially increase local temperatures -- rather than increasing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.    One of the new Science studies reported that the satellites had drifted in orbit, causing errors in temperature measurement. Corrections to the satellite data, according to the researchers, would increase the atmospheric warming estimate to 0.19 deg. C/decade -- more in line with the 0.20 deg. C/decade warming of the Earth's surface. Another study reported that heating from tropical sunlight had skewed the balloon temperature measurements.    Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the studies' authors, told USA Today that, \\"Once corrected, the satellite and balloon temperatures align with other surface and upper atmosphere measures, as well as climate change models.\\"  So is it really game-set-match in favor of the global warming alarmists? Not so fast, say the skeptics.    When University of Alabama-Huntsville researcher Roy Spencer, a prominent climatologist, factored the newly reported corrections into his calculations, his estimate of atmospheric warming was only 0.12 deg. C/decade -- higher than the prior estimate of 0.09 deg. C/decade, but well below the Science study estimate of 0.19 deg C/decade and the surface temperature estimate of 0.20 deg. C/decade.    As to the claimed errors in the weather balloon measurements, Spencer says that no other effort to adjust the balloon data has produced warming estimates as high as those reported in the new study and that it will take time for the research community to form opinions about whether the new adjustments advocated are justified.  Climate expert Dr. Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy Project says the temperature adjustments are \\"not a big deal.\\"    \\"Greenhouse theory says (and the models calculate) that the atmospheric trend should be 30 percent greater than the surface trend -- and it isn't,\\" says Singer. \\"Furthermore, the models predict that polar [temperature] trends should greatly exceed the tropical values -- and they clearly don't ... In fact, the Antarctic has been cooling,\\" adds Singer.  Singer also had some related thoughts concerning the gloom-and-doom forecasts concerning future temperatures.    Last January, a study in the journal Nature estimated that a doubling of atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would increase global temperatures anywhere from 1.9 degrees Centigrade to 11.5 degrees Centigrade by mid-century. But Singer says the researchers \\"varied only six out of many more parameters necessary to model clouds... Their result confirms... that clouds are still too difficult to model and that climate models underlying the Kyoto Protocol have never been validated.\\"    So it's far from \\"case-closed\\" on global warming skepticism. Moreover, aside from the controversy over the satellite and weather balloon data, many key climate questions remain unanswered including: whether humans are causing significant warming; whether warming is undesirable; and whether anything be done to avert any undesirable warming.  Because of its prohibitive costs, alarm over global warming has been rejected numerous times by President Bush and the U.S. Senate. European nations are already discovering that their economies can't live with the Kyoto Protocol that was just implemented in February.    Despite alarmist media reports, global warming-mania is melting. It's no wonder the alarmists are in such a hurry to close the book on the science.  [...]  Hope this helped.
B000002HRE|2.0|So, here it is...Reload, the last part of the Load albums, and if you thought Load was bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Load was a bad album, I gave it 2 stars ONLY because of King Nothing and Ain't my B**ch, those were GOOD songs, but the rest of Load was either boring, or just plain crappy. Reload is a lot like Load. For one, the band is still too ignorant to go back to the eighties and even Black Album days like so many fans wanted and still have hope for. Secondly all the songs (except 2 and 4) never go over the 4 minute mark, and tracks 2 and 4 are shortened on the radio. Thirdly there are only 2 good songs here, just like Load. The 2 good songs are Fuel and Devils Dance. So if theres two good songs on both Load and Reload, then why is Reload worse you ask? Because the other songs on Reload just sound like paradies of each other, at least Load had some musical diversity! I hate that annoying old lady in the backround of 'The Memory Remains', which would have been the third good song if they kept her out. The Unforgiven II is not a ballad, and is much worse than the original (which wasn't that great, either). If you still want to get this after reading all that, then I guess be my guest, but ONLY get it to make a collection of Metallica CD's. If you get this because of the music then unless you have never heard anything besides todays mainstream crap (which makes this look like Jesus) than you WILL be disappointed. <br />Right, rating the 'Tallica albums: <br />1. ...And Justice For All 10/10 <br />2. Kill 'em All 9.75/10 <br />3. Ride the Lightning 9/10 <br />4. Master of Puppets 8/10 <br />5. Black Album 7/10 <br />6. Load 4/10 <br />7. Reload 2.5/10 <br />8. St. Anger Unratable
B000002A3T|4.0|There have been reviews written about this album that seem to focus on the Gilmour / Waters controversy, and whether or not the absense of Roger Waters from this album makes it a true \\"Pink Floyd\\" album. It's a natural question to ask, I suppose, as both of these artists have distinct personalities, and seem to come from opposite ends of the spectrum. And the absense of Roger Waters from this collection is evident. It would be nice if he was here, but he isn't.  <br /> <br />Having said that, what about the MUSIC? \\"Division Bell\\" contains typical Pink Floyd trademarks, including flowing instrumentals, interesting lyrics, great musicianship, and the classic sound effects, all arranged in Pink Floyd fashion. <br /> <br />It's a good collection. An easy listen, it plays along the lines of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", with melodies such as \\"Poles Apart\\", and \\"Take It Back\\", and even has some resemblance to Floyd's \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", as the entire album creates a somewhat spacey (for lack of a better word) environment. \\"Division Bell\\" is a long way from the hopelessness portrayed in Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", or \\"Final Cut\\". Lyrically, it's a typical Floyd downer, but the music is definitely more upbeat, and simple. The album finishes with a well done, spiteful number called \\"Lost For Words\\", and fades into the final tune, entitled \\"High Hopes\\", which has a certain lyrical resemblance to \\"Time\\", from \\"Dark Side\\". This fades into a sweet three-minute Gilmour solo, which rivals any solo he's ever done.  <br /> <br />The sound is very clean (which one would expect from a Floyd album), and the package contains a lyric booklet, which includes some interesting photos, and artwork. <br /> <br />As a true Floyd fan for thirty-odd years, I honesty believe that \\"Division Bell\\" is second only to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". There are at least five tunes on this album that would qualify for my \\"Pink Floyd's Greatest Hits\\" collection. Make no mistake about it: \\"Division Bell\\" is a genuine Pink Floyd album. <br /> <br />O.K. Now we can all go back to the Waters / Gilmour controversy...
B000089RVX|5.0|Just one general note before the track breakdown. Listen to the lyrics on this album, folks. This isn't like any other band's lyrics, where the motto is \\"I loved her, she dumped me, I was depressed, yatta yatta yatta.\\" No. The lyrics on Fallen are simply astounding, chilling, profound, haunting, intense, heartrending. Nine of the eleven songs on this album have made me cry. Go figure. <br /> <br />Going under - Amy Lee's favorite 'Fallen' song, Going Under is one of the three \\"Gothic Tracks\\" of the album, should you consider Evanescence a Gothic-inspired band. Its dark, angsty, richly worded, very original, and overall, an enchanting opening to the album. 16/20  <br /> <br />Bring Me to Life - The most famous Evanescence song. A breathtaking and portent-filled piano melody begins the song and is then mutated into what has won numerous awards, including Best Rock Song and Best Hard Rock song. Amy Lee's vocals are absolutely incredible and the lyrics will render you speechless. 20/20 <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool - A dazzling guitar riff sets the tone for Everybody's Fool. Full of despair and determination, it is a perfect balance between the forces of good and evil. Perhaps the most powerful lyrics in the album are found in this song. Coupled with a sensational melody and administered by Amy Lee's passionate vocals, Everybody's Fool is more than a song. It's a tour de force. 17/20   <br /> <br />My Immortal - Pure pain and anguish spilled into a musical melody, Grammy Nomination 'My Immortal' is Evanescence's most popular song after 'Bring Me to Life'. Exquisite vocals, agonizing lyrics, soothing piano, and a stunningly beautiful melody will yield tears on the toughest of hearts. 20/20 <br /> <br />Haunted - The second of the three aforementioned \\"Gothic  tracks\\". VERY dark and EXTREMELY disturbing. The choir addition at the end will only serve to haunt you further. Creepy and bone-chilling to the core, if the music in Haunted won't leave a strong impression on you,the lyrics will. Guaranteeed. 16/20 <br /> <br />Tourniquet - A magnificent guitar opening is steered into forceful, painful vocals and a torture-filled melody. Uniquely dark. The strings at the end of Tourniquet serve to lead up to its larger counterpart, Imaginary. 16/20 <br /> <br />Imaginary - Considered by Evanescence themselves to be one of their best songs of their five-year professional career, Imaginary is the epitome of classical music richly embellished with hard, dark rock, embroidered with a thread of pop and laced with just a dash of metal. Add Amy Lee's spine-tingling voice to the mix and you've got yourself a celestial musical masterpiece. A true magnum opus. 20/20 <br /> <br />Taking Over Me - As with Bring Me to Life and My Immortal, Taking over Me opens with a heavenly piano solo which opens the gate to a striking guitar sequence. Amy Lee's dazzling, powerful vocals and lyrical talent are oh-so-exposed in this heartrending creation. There is an angelic vocal solo with soft piano accompaniment near the end. Overall, simply beautiful. 20/20 <br /> <br />Hello - Written for the death of Amy Lee's sister. Gentle piano notes lead to ardent, passionate passages with a low cello solo near the end. Of course, Lee's voice only serves to enrich. Truly heartbreaking. 17/20 <br /> <br />My Last Breath - Interestingly enough, this song opens up with an almost pop-like sonancy. Commencing with synthesizer, it is then transformed into a classical Evanescence production. Very powerful lyrics and compelling melody. My last breath is what many consider to be the \\"love song\\" of Fallen. 14/20 <br /> <br />Whisper - This legendary song (Whisper and Imaginary are Evanescence's oldest masterpieces) speaks for itself. Orientally-themed, grippingly lyricized, and the third of the three aforementioned \\"Gothic  tracks\\", Whisper is a mightily enchanting piece. The Latin at the end finishes off the album on a dark, angsty note. 16/20 <br /> <br />All in all, musically, lyrically, and vocally this album is absolutely flawless. Buy it!
0811806405|5.0|If you are interested in building a guitar or just understanding the process, then this is the book for you. It is the benchmark upon which all other reference books of this kind are judged, and for good reason. The information in this book is over 20 years old but lutherie has not changed much in the last 200 years, so quite simply, it is still up to date for anyone who does not run a factory with a CNC Router.  <br /> <br />The only noteworthy change in construction for the modern builder has been addressed by the author, Mr Cumpiano has a website that provides a detailed description to allow for the bolt on neck fastening system he now uses. This is different to the dowel pin system that is described in the book, however this change is more a supplement to assist those wishing to use a simplified method rather than an acknowledgement of any fault with the original method. <br /> <br />Money well spent, pity I can not give it a 10 star rating, this book deserves it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Part pulp fiction, part film noir, part graphic novel, wholly original.  This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.  Though assisted by Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino I was trying to spot the efforts from these contributors, particularly Tarantino, but was hard pressed.  If this was a case where the stunning visuals surpassed the story then this film would be easy to dismiss but that's not the case here.  The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.  The acting here is also not overwhelmed by the visuals.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.  The women here  offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.  The real find here is newcomer Devon Aoki as the lethal Meho.  This film may not be to everybody's taste but it cannot be faulted for lack of originality.

0780622553|1.0|I'm giving this movie a 1 to counteract all the undeserved 5's. If no counteraction was needed, I would probably give it 2 or 3 stars.     Some people would have you believe that this is better than the Matrix and that the ending somehow raises important philosophical questions. Don't believe them. Here's what the movie is about: A bunch of aliens from another world are dying and they abduct a bunch of humans from earth. They put those humans on a spaceship that looks like a city and they perform experiments on them in order to find out what makes them human. One human guy resists the aliens, overpowers them, and takes control of the spaceship. Oh yeah, he also gains god-like powers and can make the spaceship create stuff. Stuff like oceans, beaches and yes, even a sun. The end.     There are no questions being raised here about the nature of reality. The reality is clearly shown in the movie: a city spaceship floating in space amongst the stars. There are only practical questions raised like how far from earth they are, how long have they been abducted for, how does the technology on the spaceship work, how do they get back to earth, etc.     If you're not into fantasy/horror, then you'll most likely be bored and underwhelmed. This is definitely not a scifi movie.

B000001FI7|5.0|Dummy is a musical landmark in the world of urban music. It brought an unprecedented flavor to the scene, creating a genre of it's own. Its poignant vocals seem to emerge from its dark and mirky textures, like light bursting out of darkness. The sometimes gritty beats could have come out of the most obscure of NY hiphop of those times, yet it resulted as an easy listening experience, soothing, with a hint of melancholy. Its influence on the music world was undeniable and soon enough, pale imitations appeared, some more successful than others, but Portishead outlasted them all as it still gathers new fans through the years in spite of the band's incomprehensible absence and mutism.
B00004YA66|4.0|As in all science fiction books or movies, once you accept the basic premise (time travel), everything else falls into place superbly. Crisply directed, believable special effects and really a fine FAMILY story (a rarity in these days of \\"M...F..k\\" crude language and a total absense of discernible plot line).
B000003TSP|5.0|Not as friendly to the ears as the first album, this second attempt begs the listener to let oneself be slowly digested by this new, more mature, slightly different sound. Beth Gibbon's voice shows extended range and changing textures, sometimes lulling the listener to believe more than one vocalist collaborated to the effort. Gibbons' songwriting improving with experience, the first album's black and white composition and contrasts gave way to subtle shades of grey, resulting in a deeper, more refined blend of the vocals, lyrics and arrangements. The trio definitely seemed to connect on a higher level in the creation process that gave birth to one of the genre's most memorable albums, which consolidated its reputation and propelled the band to a rather strange underground iconic status after gaining a cult following.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|A great special edition DVD with lots of extras.  The music videos are especially good.
B00000DFSK|5.0|This 15 track compilation consists of some of the better U2 songs and the most well known and a sure bet is this album is definitely the 'Best Of' compilation. Different people will have different tastes however many U2 fans or fans of solid rock'n'roll should enjoy this album that is a sojourn into memory lane. Songs like 'Pride', 'With Or Without You' and 'New Year's Day' start the album and show why U2 became a much sought after band by 1984. This is a journey into the early music of this Irish band from Dublin. With a crisp song in 'Where The Streets Have No Name' midway into the album shows the beautiful softness Bono can sing too. U2 have been at the forefront of many social and political topics and can easily create a song based on these issues and for the most part the songs are creative and immensely positive making the listener reflect. To round off this fabulous album, U2 included the romantic songs of 'Desire' and 'When Love Comes To Town' which are 2 great songs on their own.<br /><br />This album is part one to the 'Best Of' collection. Bono and crew have excelled once again.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This isn't an opinion based review. I do like this album, but that's not what this review is about. The point of this review is to say to everyone who is wondering why lots of people are giving this album bad reviews that the only reason people are giving bad reviews is because they forgot how long it took them to love the old NIN albums. Most NIN fans will agree that they did not LOVE the downward spiral, further down the spiral, broken, fixed or phm, even the fragile on the very first listen. No one can eat six weeks of food in one sitting, and it is hard to fall in love with complex music upon first listen.  <br /> <br />The truth about this album, [with teeth] is that it is Trent Reznor doing what he's always done, make music for the sake of making music, not for money. If you liked his old stuff, give this stuff a chance. <br /> <br />...and just to help everyone else out, if you do get this album and don't love it after the VERY FIRST LISTEN, please don't get on the internet and review it immediately with your rose-coloured reviews referencing his older material. <br /> <br />There should be a rule stating that albums should have been listened to at least 10 times before reviewing, because most negative reviews of this album are knee-jerk reactions from people with no memory. <br /> <br />SWEIGHT!!! <br /> <br />
B000687M48|5.0|I often wondered after the popularity of 'Fallen' faded away and the leaving of Ben Moody (a co-founder of Evanescence) what would happen to Amy Lee and Evanescence in total. 'Anywhere But Home' is a double CD/DVD combo featuring Live in Concert performances from The Zenith in Paris from the 2004 European tour. The audio CD covers the complete concert and includes only one non-live song in the B-side 'Missing'.<br /><br />The DVD contains the complete in concert feature and also a 1 hour behind the scenes footage and documentaries and interviews of the band and Amy Lee herself. Through navigation on this DVD copy the fan will find 6 music videos of the famous songs like 'Going Under', 'Whisper' and 'My Immortal'.<br /><br />This album release shows Evanescence is not a spent force but Amy Lee and her trio of rockers will carry the torch on. I totally enjoyed the CD and DVD and all I can say, Amy's voice is wonderful.
B000AA4LAK|4.0|I have to admit I didn't really give The Killers a chance when they first came out. Went I originally heard Somebody Told Me, I just clumped the band with the other pretentious bands that emanated from New York whom all seem to start the band with \\"The.\\" Then when Mr. Brightside came out, again, I really wasn't feeling it, although I did give the song a chance due to the video featuring Eric Roberts and a Kate Bosworth look-a-like. Eventually the song grew on me, and so did the absurdity of the chorus of Somebody Told Me. And I absolutely love All These Things I've Done when I first heard it. Eventually I had the urge to buy their album Hot Fuss.  <br /> <br />The album, if you haven't been able to tell by the singles already, is an 80's synth-pop influenced album, accompanied by mostly absurd lyrics and catchy wordplay like my personal favorite, \\"I got soul, but I'm not a soldier.\\" The album starts off with the seriously Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, a song about a lost love, \\"We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain. She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go.\\" This then transitions into the big hit, the upbeat sounding Mr. Brightside. Smile Like You Mean It sounds like something that should be in a Cure tribute album. But the lyrics are more clever than Robert Smith could devise such as, \\"Save some face, you know you've only got one.\\" <br /> <br />The wordplay don't get more absurd than the chorus to the Somebody Told Me, \\"Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year.\\" It fun to sing along to, but once to realize what you saying it seems creepy. Who want a girlfriend that looked like some chick's boyfriend? But anyways. For how weird the chorus to All These Things I've Done is, the song of itself is a poignant song about redemption, \\"Over and in, last call for sin. While everyone's lost, the battle is won with all these things that I've done.\\" <br /> <br />The band goes for over the top bombast with Andy You're a Star which deals with the popularity of high school as, \\"Andy, you're a star in nobody's eyes but mine.\\" The also slow things down for the original album closer Everything Will Be All Right. There was sort of a feud the band had with The Bravery that I never got until I heard Change Your Mind. Brandon Flowers, lead singer of The Killers, has a point for calling the other band copy cats because The Bravery totally ripped off their sound from this song. <br /> <br />As for the new songs the best is Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll which sounds nothing like anything else on the album. The band borrow the crunching guitars from a Coldplay song, but Flowers approaches the singing like that of a British punk band from the late 80's. The Ballad of Michael Valentine follows the life of a professional gambler around the country but the name has been changed to protect the innocent. Under the Gun goes faster than most of their songs and sort of features the bands mantra in the chorus \\"Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, again and again.\\" This song makes a better finish than the original one and is probably a killer when performed live. (Yes the bad pun was intended.)
B00006LIRI|4.0|This compilation album covers the 1990-1999 decade of U2 and includes some great songs. Whilst not at good as the first decade 'Best Of', U2 is still a powerhouse in the folk rock'n'roll scene even now. The album opens up with 3 superhits of U2; 'Even Better Than The Real Thing', 'Mysterious Ways' and 'Beautiful Day'. The album moves into the newer sound style of U2 with a more upbeat rock sound and the continuation of Bono's typical emotional singing. The songs of 'One' and 'Stay' are also included in this 'Best Of' and are great songs for a party atmosphere. The latter part of the album revels in classic songs being remixed/re-edited including 'Numb' and 'Dicotheque'. These new mixes previously unrealeased are good but the originals remain top-stuff. The new mix of 'Staring At The Sun' is also worth a listen.<br /><br />This CD is for any fan of U2 and wants good music in their music library.

It will not entertain you, it will not make you feel smarter, it will not make people think you are smarter...after they read it too. The lead character is the type of person everyone can hate.

0553382179|5.0|I found this book extremely helpful and the concept very easy to follow.  It was the first self-help book I have read cover to cover in many years.  My sink has been shining for 60 days now and other new habits have followed.
B000819PKC|2.0|Ever since bass player Stuart Zender left the band, it has been gradually going downhill. \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" still breathed some influence from his great lines and songwriting, but all releases after that are actually flat and boring compared to the soulful acid jazz extravaganza of the first two albums. Especially the tracks with a house beat really make me cringe. Why does Jay Kay want to appeal to the club going masses so much? The only thing I can think of is: money.     Jay Kay of course is fully entitled to go for the big buck before his time in the limelight is up. I just don't want to be witness to his musical decline anymore, so this will likely be the last Jamiroquai-album I will ever have purchased.     The only reason why I give this album 2 stars instead of one is the track \\"Seven Days in Sunny June\\", which still breathes some of the class of Jamiroquai's glory days (although it still would have sounded better with Zender on bass).
B00005JNJT|4.0|After being disillusioned by just about every comic book \\"blockbuster\\" of recent times (yes i was a minority to the two Spiderman movies, i didn't care for them, same goes with Daredevil, Hellboy and the first X-Men...they frankly sucked.) Batman Begins comes as a nice surprise.  <br /> <br />The film draws a lot of visual inspiration from the actual comics and looks all the more impressive for it. The storytelling is done at a decent pace, giving each stage just enough time to have an impact before moving on. On the acting front Liam Nesson is excellent as always, Michael Cane as Alfred is brilliant as well serving as the comic relief. Katie Holmes is a bit disappointing but her role is largely forgettable. Christian Bale does an excellent job of re-imagining Bruce Wayne. Watch out for Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow....genius in the making.... Just goes to show, with this and Sin City looks like Hollywood is turning a to a \\"real\\" look for comic book films.  <br />

B0007GAERG|5.0|Okay, for all you Mariah fans that have been waiting for a hot, full-force comeback, this is it!  I have been a Mariah fan for well over a decade now, and I've been waiting for her to re-emerge as the phenominal artist she was back in the 90's.  With power-house vocals on ballads like \\"Hero,\\" \\"Vision of Love,\\" and \\"My All\\" as well as catchy urban dance numbers like \\"Fantasy,\\" \\"Honey,\\" and \\"Heartbreaker,\\" Mariah dominated the charts throughout the 1990's.  She has set record after record, both for female vocalists and just plain vocalists. <br /> <br />However, it has been evident that Mariah has struggled to find her place with her fans, critics, and commercial success since the late 90's.  'Butterfly,' lyrically poingiant and emotionally personal, still remains in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, her best album to date.  'Rainbow,' a rollercoaster of variety was also a solid effort, lyrically showcasing Mariah's depth as an artist.  The album is pure ear candy.  However, where most of her other albums have produced 3-4 good hits, both of these albums only produced 2 real hits, mostly due to lack of good campaigning for the songs and poor releasing.   <br /> <br />Mariah went on to attempt acting in a severely underrated, but nowhere near good, movie and accompanying soundtrack.  Mariah put her heart and soul into the lousy script of the \\"Glitter\\" movie. Her powerhouse vocals were no match for the lack of emotional depth and feeling and the poor production of the \\"Glitter\\" album.  The critics tore the movie apart, and the tragedy of September 11, 2001-- the day the album was released--played a crucial role in the sale of the CD. The record spun out one hit, the un-interesting single \\"Loverboy,\\" which made it to #2 on the charts only after Virgin records sliced the price of the single down to about 40-something cents.  Mariah suffered a pretty serious emotional breakdown after the tragedy that was \\"Glitter\\" (hell, I would have too!) and it was becoming clear that this could very well be the end of the superstar. <br /> <br />However, Mariah did some serious soul-searching in one final attempt to replace herself in the spotlight.  The lyrically excellent \\"Charmbracelet\\" put out a few mild hits, especially \\"Through the Rain\\" (remnicient of her former ballads) in hopes that they would re-connect Mariah with her fans.  Indeed, \\"Charmbracelet\\" DID give Mariah some of her success back, but the response was iffy.  The CD was far better than \\"Glitter,\\" especially lyrically, but was musically lacking in what makes a singer a star.  <br /> <br />After some time off, some more serious soul-searching, and an excellent musical production team, Mariah has put forth a CD that very well could be the album of the decade!  The widespread reception of the first single \\"It's Like That\\" and the immediate and intense success of both the album itself and its second and third singles have all shown us that Mariah is back.  With her old fans, with her new fans, with the critics, with the radio, with everyone! <br /> <br />'The Emancipation of Mimi' is by far her best effort in years.  It is a hot, R&B and club-laced disc that you can spin in your CD player on your way to work or school, on the way to the beach, on the way to the club on the weekends, pretty much any time!  The first and third singles, \\"It's Like That,\\" and \\"Shake it Off\\" show us that Mariah is back with a new, bass-thumping groove.  Both of these songs fit in well with any club playlist.  Others that you'll have to add to your club CD mix are \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop Dogg and \\"Get Your Number\\" with JD.  The immensely successful second single \\"We Belong Together\\" is a typical R&B ballad enhanced by Mariah's vocals and excellent musical execution.  Another hip hop ballad, \\"One and Only\\" spins a mile-a-minute rap verse with a guest appearance by Twista.  All these songs are excellent: comercially, lyrically, AND musically.   <br /> <br />But for the true and long-time Mariahfans, the tracks where Mariah truly shines are on the jazzy, night-club-like ballads such as \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Circles,\\" the exceptional \\"I Wish You Knew,\\" and the gospel closer \\"Fly Like A Bird.\\"  These are the tracks that truly show us that Mariah is an artist who has withstood the test of time and is here to stay for good.   <br /> <br />The Songs... <br /> <br />1.  \\"It's Like That\\" 9/10:  A thumping, R&B party song with guest appearances by JD and Fatman Scoop.  An excellent club song that kicks the CD off and shows us where Mariah is headed. <br /> <br />2.  \\"We Belong Together\\" 10/10:  Beautiful, bittersweet R&B ballad featuring a powerhouse conclusion by Mariah, a catchy beat, and smart lyrics <br /> <br />3.  \\"Shake It Off\\"  10/10:  Musically remnicient of Usher's \\"Confessions Part II,\\" except with a bigger beat, this is another pure R&B thumper that would fit on any club or hip hop playlist <br /> <br />4.  \\"Mine Again\\"  10/10:  Probably the best vocals Mariah pulls off on the CD.  An excellent, jazzy, powerhouse ballad complete with horns and a jazz organ.  Kelly Clarkson, we're glad you didn't attempt this one on 'American Idol'!! <br /> <br />5.  \\"Say Somethin'\\"  8/10:  Good dance song with a mild and melodic breakdown verse with guest rapper Snoop Dogg.  Nothing really powerhouse here, just good beat and conservative vocals.  Fits well between #'s 4 and 6 <br /> <br />6.  \\"Stay The Night\\"  9/10:  Another powerhouse R&B song by Mariah.  Compare it musically to Ashanti's \\"Rain on Me\\" and you'll find some similarities.  Only the instrumentation here is more authentic <br /> <br />7. \\"Get Your Number\\"  9/10:  Hot club track complete with strong vocals by JD on the chorus and a smart and catchy breakdown bridge by Mariah on both verses.  Turn the volume up on this one and blare it all the way to the club! <br /> <br />8.  \\"One and Only\\"  10/10:  Excellent mid-tempo hip hop ballad about a painful relationship.  Mariah conservatively shows her mad side on this track, throwing obvious but censored profanities on both verses and raw emotion in the song's vocals.  This song is a real treat to hear Twista's whirlwind breakdown during the bridge.  <br /> <br />9.  \\"Circles\\"  10/10:  Wonderful jazzy ballad about the follow-up to a painful breakup.  A little more up-tempo than \\"Mine Again,\\" this track again showcases the vocals that have made Mariah into the success that she is today. <br /> <br />10.  \\"Your Girl\\"  8/10:  Brief, straightforward pop number that possibly reflects Mariah's earlier days of \\"Honey,\\" \\"Fantasy,\\" and \\"Heartbreaker.\\"  Complete with come-and-get-me vocals and lyrics, this should be a short treat for fans <br /> <br />11.  \\"I Wish You Knew\\"  11/10:  I rate this song above the normal rating, because it is superior to all the rest on the track.  Mariah's vocals, lyrics, musical production, and everything else is just out the roof on this song.  This is by far the best song on the CD.  Made complete with a cool, fake live audience in the background, this jazzy ballad is ear-candy, heart-candy, everything-candy.  I can't stop hitting the repeat button on this!  True Mariah fans should enjoy the spoken word by Mariah in the bridge and the hot high note she hits towards the end.  This song is worth the price of the CD alone!  Exceptional songwriting and musical execution!  Way to go Mariah!! <br /> <br />12.  \\"To The Floor\\"  5/10:  Definitely the album's biggest disappointment.  When I saw Mariah was doing a song with Nelly, my heart raced a million miles a minute.  I thought, \\"Mariah and Nelly paired together are gonna make a really hot track! This is gonna be one of the album highlights.\\"  I was wrong.  What you really get from this is trite and boring lyrics, a bland melody, with a pretty good beat.  This is a collaboration that could have been excellent with a better song.  Still, it's a good one to dance to... <br /> <br />13.  \\"Joy Ride\\"  10/10:  Probably my second favorite on the album, this is a sweet pop/R&B ballad complete with excellent vocals by Mariah that range from really low to really high, and build from girlishly soft at the beginning to a powerhouse climax towards the end, and the best song conclusion on the disc. <br /> <br />14.  \\"Fly Like a Bird\\"  9/10:  A jazzy gospel closer that deserves a place on the Sunday morning bulletin.  It is a little drawn out towards the end, a radio edit type of thing would make this better, but is a huge conclusion vocally and musically by Mariah.  I have a hard time comparing it to the rest of the CD, because it's one of a kind on here, and the overtly religious lyrics seem a little out of place alongside the racier lyrics that appear on a few of the album's tracks.  Nonetheless, it's another one of Mariah's gems that makes the album shine so much. <br /> <br />15.  \\"Secret Love\\"  10/10:  Although it doesn't appear on on the 'Mimi' CD, I got this one free for buying the CD from Wal-Mart.  I liked it so much that I had to review it.  An excellent, thumping dance number that should have been included as a bonus or hidden track on the US version of 'Mimi.'

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This imaginative film is a slapdash collection of sight gags, jokes, serious kung fu, poor taste, and a love story.  Chow doesn't seem to be able to make up his mind what kind of movie he wants to make.  Instead, he gives us some of everything. <br /> <br />Thank goodness! This is not like any other movie you've ever seen.  One moment there will be a complex kung fu ballet, and the next moment two characters are chasing each other down the road like the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.  It's confusing at times, but it's all fun. <br /> <br />You'll probably enjoy this flick more the second time you see it, because you'll have figured out who the heroes and villains are, and why they are doing what they are doing.  Chow proves there is a place for cheesy in action/humor/cartoon cinema.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I give high recommendation for you readers to see this exceptional production of BBC, based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell. I have a number of BBC productions here, but this one is remarkable and quite different.<br /><br />  To begin, this four-episode film has a darker shade than the rest of them; for good reasons, too, since the story is set in the industrial town of Milton in northern England, sometime during the mid 1800's, if I'm not mistaken. As one of the characters puts it: \\"a God-forsaken place where people breathe smoke and eat money!\\" Pollution, death and class distinction between workers and their masters are much evidently played out here. Even the message about unions and strikes are unashamedly laid out on the table. BBC's renditions of \\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" were never this dark, brooding and straightforward.<br /><br />  Another merit this film has is its fiery intensity and passion. Just the scene where Margaret rejects Mr. Thornton is proof enough. People may say that this scene is just another \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in another packaging, but still Director Brian Percival did a very good job of distinguishing this one from the former, even topping it out, as many testimonials in Amazon.UK and here will point out.<br /><br />  Many reviewers will say that this and that character steals the screen, but in my point of view, they are all scene stealers. The performances are top-rate, especially by the two mothers, who seem to symbolize opposite ends of disposition to me. I love both of them. Just watch as the soft-spoken Mrs. Hale (Lesley Manville) scold her husband for dragging them into \\"this God-forsaken place!\\" Watch, too, for the scene where tough Mrs. Thornton (Sinead Cusack,) in a surprising turn, counsels her son to pursue Miss Hale. As for the two younger leads, they are marked for their likability and attractiveness. Miss Denby-Ashe is simply beautiful as Margaret Hale, our sweet-natured but surprisingly head-strong female protagonist. Her belief in other people's good is what won me over. As for the uncommonly handsome Mr. Armitage, well, I read a review at Amazon.UK where the reviewer commented that she ovulated everytime the guy popped into the screen. Now although it is impossible for me to ovulate, I can at least give weight to her praises. I don't ever recall seeing such a strong male screen presence before. This may be the reason why the \\"rejection scene\\" was pulled off perfectly.<br /><br />  Hey, isn't that the adorable Pegotty (Pauline Quirke) from \\"David Copperfield\\" in another role as household servant?<br /><br />  I do admit that this production has at least one misfire: the ending was a bit maple-syrupy. After all the fiery intensity the movie went through, the ending seems a bit out of place. Mr. Thornton became quiet and subdued and happy all of a sudden, after much scowling and smouldering throughtout. I wondered whether Margaret doubted his intentions since she had come into a considerable fortune. But ladies, I don't believe any of you will care about what I just said here. All you will care about is Richard Armitage, and Richard Armitage alone, plus his kiss!! And guys, isn't Daniela Denby-Ashe simply adorable? So who cares about that tiny misfire, right? And anyway, Margaret could not have had thoughts of doubt regarding Mr. Thornton's character, since it was she who believed in him first and foremost.<br /><br />  All in all, the production values are exemplary, the performances top-notch. The electricity and romance are to die for. E. Gaskell's message is truthful enough, I just wished that the world we live in nowadays could solve its problems by simply understanding the other side, and dialogue. This film teaches something about giving way to others.<br /><br />  Finally, special mention to the magnificent score by Martin Phipps. Here, I wish to gain the attention of BBC: kudos for including \\"Deleted Scenes\\" into the Special Features. But it would havebeen more interesting if you didn't dispose of \\"The Making Of...\\" and \\"The Music Of...\\" that were normally mainstays of your DVDs. These are things I have come to love in a BBC DVD. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who share my views on this matter.<br /><br />  A note to would-be viewers: one particular death scene (there are four in all!!) might disturb younger viewers.didn't dispose of \\"The Making Of...\\" and \\"The Music Of...\\" that were normally mainstays of your DVDs.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|Playwright Patrick Marber, who adapted his stage play for the large screen, has obviously been very influenced by playwrights the likes of Harold Pinter (think the relationships in \\"Betrayal\\") and David Mamet (think the staccato scene structure of \\"A Life in the Theatre\\"). Granted, if you're going to be influenced by other writers, then why not two of the best playwrights of our time. Perhaps it is this reason why \\"Closer\\" has a somewhat less-than-original feeling about it. Then pepper it with a touch of Tom Stoppard's \\"The Real Thing\\" and you start experiencing d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu.<br /><br />That having been said, is there really anything truly new under the sun?  OK, occasionally - that's what makes a great writer great - but that is extremely rare. So Marber is not setting new benchmarks, but by coupling up with the brilliant Mike Nichols, Marber was able to bring something rather new to the large screen...something that is usually reserved for the relative few who venture out to the theatres of this world - and I don't mean the ones playing the latest Andrew Lloyd Weber musical.<br /><br />So far, I have met no one who \\"sort of\\" likes this film. Everyone I have spoken to about it either loves it, or hates it. This is quite evident in the reviews that one reads here on Amazon. I, however, am truly in the middle.<br /><br />Getting past my Pinter-Mamet-Stoppard d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu, I was faced with a piece that is much more at home on a theatre stage than it is on a movie screen. The two media normally have very different structures, feelings and pacing. Rarely does it work to adapt a theatre piece for the large screen. The success here was only marginal. The biggest problem with \\"Closer\\" is it's pacing. Given what the story is trying to achieve, however, there isn't much one could do to improve that, I'm afraid. Put this same piece on a stage, however, and you wouldn't think it slow at all - it's all about the media.<br /><br />Whereas the 4 different relationships, between the 4 characters of this piece constantly ring true, and I can't imagine that anyone will not at times feel like Marber was spying through your keyhole, the truths here are not earth-shaking. You might be engaged for the 104 minutes of the film, feeling at times like you are 14 years old and your mother is waving the dirty magazine she found under your mattress in your face, but this engagement dissolves after the beautiful title song plays out at the end of the film. You don't spend days mulling over this piece like you do after watching, for example, Stoppard's \\"Arcadia\\".<br /><br />So let me sum up my feelings about Patrick Marber: a good solid writer for the stage, who deserves to have his pieces produced, but might not leave that big a mark as a legacy unless he can find a more unique style and finds truths to tell that are more earth-shaking than \\"we're all dirty, rotten liars deep down inside\\".<br /><br />There is a major upside to \\"Closer\\" and that lies in the magnificent cast. Roberts, Law, Owen and Portman give their best performances to date in this film. Natalie Portman steals a show, however, that is damn near impossible to steal. You won't be able to take your eyes off of her. She absolutely lights up the screen. If there is no other reason to see this film, then is it for her brilliant performance. Clive Owen's work is also amazing. As good as Julia Roberts and Jude Law are in their roles, one does understand the Golden Globe Awards and the Oscar nominations for both Portman and Owen.<br /><br />Bottom line: go into it with an open mind, not expecting your normal movie fare, and you might just appreciate it.he 4 characters of this piece constantly ring true, and I can't imagine that anyone will not at times feel like Marber was spying through your keyhole, the truths here are not earth-shaking.

0060989157|5.0|Everybody's first words in their reviews are: \\"I am not a fan of Motley Crue but...\\" Yeah, before I read the book, I thought the same thing, but after reading it I realized that I would not be ashamed to listen to Motley Crue... not that I do yet, but my respect for a group that I once thought epitomized everything bad about hair metal has sky-rocketted. <br /> <br />If you are prepared to invest your time in reading a biography of Motley Crue, you probably know something about their anarchic lifestyle already: they drank, did drugs, banged hookers, banged waitresses, killed a few folks, annoyed Japanese people, banged stewardesses, did more drugs, banged movie stars, banged strippers, got divorces, grew up in crappy neighborhoods, banged groupies, went to rehab, purchased expensive automobiles, banged ugly chicks, shot people, banged hot chicks, and played straight to the point rock-n-roll about all of the aformentioned things. <br /> <br />But, the book wasn't just about the rock-n-roll life, it was also about the lives of 4 really messed up guys (5 if you want to count Corabi, but he wasn't really that messed up) who were all too human. Mick Mars had to go through more alimony rubbish than any man could take. Vince Neil lost his 4 year old daughter to a particularly nasty form of cancer. Tommy Lee got punched in the face by his wife. Nikki Sixx had forks levitate in front of him... actually that isn't that normal... Somehow these four, mostly uneducated guys managed to convey the feelings behind the debauchery... probably with the help of an extreme editor (who sadly enough did not remove Tommy Lee's persistent use of the word 'bro'). <br /> <br />Reading about the Crue makes you feel like you didn't really live. At one party they would probably take more drugs than most people could claim to take in a lifetime... in one night they could get laid more than most people do by the time they are forty. These people lived really extrodinary lives, even though they were a bunch of guys who dressed in stiletto heels and leather pants. Sure, a lot of their music sucked, though there is probably a lot of good to be found in it as well, but they were not known so much for that as they were known for the Crue way of life. <br /> <br />Read it, it will only take you a few days.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Believe is definately Cher's most popular album. Released back in 1998, the title track made her famous all over again. The single went straight to #1 in the US and the UK, as it did in another 19 countries! After this, she released the album of the same name which also scored success on the charts. Peaking at #4 in the US, and #7 in the UK, Believe became Cher's best selling-album, to this day shifting passed the 10 million mark, and it's gone 4x Platinum in the US. Heart Of Stone was Cher's most successful album before this, and went 3x Platinum in the US.  <br /> <br />BELIEVE  <br />This was Cher's third and final US #1 single, after Dark Lady (her second US #1) and Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves (her first US #1). It scored phemonimal success on the Charts, as mentioned above. When the single hit #1 in the UK, it stayed at the top spot for 7 weeks! Believe is definately one of Cher's best efforts, and definately a song that should be remembered. It still sounds as good as it was back then, even if it is 7 year old.  <br /> <br />THE POWER <br />This is definately one of my favourites from this album, and always has been. When she sang this on her Do You Believe '99 tour, she sounded amazing! Both versions are equally fantastic. <br /> <br />RUNAWAY <br />This is an absolutely great song with brilliant lyrics. I also like this song because, like the title track, you can dance to it! This is a solid track clocking at almost 5 minutes! <br /> <br />ALL OR NOTHING <br />This is considered to be one of the best Cher songs of all-time, and definately a fan favourite. I like it, though it's not my favourite song from the album, like some claim it to be. #12 hit in the UK. <br /> <br />STRONG ENOUGH <br />This is a brilliant disco song, which reminds me of her 1979 hit Take Me Home. The music is so catchy and the lyrics aren't too bad either! One of the best on the album. The single hit #5 in the UK but a shockingly low #57 in the US. <br /> <br />DOVE LA MORE <br />Thisis an awesome latin effort, though I do prefer the Emilio Estefan Junior Remix! #21 in the UK. <br /> <br />TAKING BACK MY HEART <br />This show off Cher's R'n'B talents, and it's a song that really shows off her vocal talents, too. It's brill! <br /> <br />TAXI TAXI <br />This song is absolutely awesome. It's one of my favourite tracks from the album, and Cher never sounded better! <br /> <br />LOVE IS THE GROOVE <br />This is an absolutely great dance ballad. It's my fave from the album, and definately should have been a single! The lyrics are also quite fantastic and strong. <br /> <br />WE ALL SLEEP ALONE <br />This is my favourite Cher single of all-time, so would I be overjoyed when I listened to this? It's not the original version. It's a new dance remix and it's OK. I prefer the original. <br /> <br />Overall, Believe is definately recommended to any Cher fans out there. Every single track is above average, in its own unique, special way, and the title track proves to be a classic hit, because it's one of the best selling singles ever! Buy it!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This DVD is Excellent, because the sound is perfect and see Metallica with the San Francisco Symphony is something outside this world.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS  ==================    I loved this DVD!!!....    This is Metallica folks. A very angry, disturbed, and highly emotional threesome. This DVD goes way beyond your normal \\"Band Documentary\\". This takes you inside alomst everything that is Metallica. Their personal lives, inner struggles with one another, and in the end all of their energy.....    It was great to see Lars finally sit down with Dave Mustaine, and share their true feeling towards eachother, and the effects it's had on both of them over the years. I love Mustaine, he's one cool dude, and he's never afraid to show his true feelings. That segment was very emotional....    The Newsted conspiracy, and how he's moved on and doing his own thing without the boys. I can see why Jason left after seeing how the main three members of Metallica act towards eachother. I had no idea how much Lars and James hate eachother until I watched this. I'm not really shocked, but it's amazing how much those two inflated egos feed off eachother, and in effect bring things down....    Kirk was the coolest of them all. He seemed like the middle man throughout the entire film. The leveler so to speak. He always had something nice to say whenever things would get tough between Lars and James, and it almost seems like he's the glue that kept it all together....    This is a great film, and although it has a \\"soap\\" feel to it, it's highly entertaining throughout. I was very pleased with this purchace, and although I really didn't care for St. Anger, the tour that followed was incredible....    BUY IT!!!!

6304779356|5.0|What would happen if the members of the rock band Bon Jovi all became vampires and they decided to recruit Jim Morrison into the group? That's kind of what the plot of this '87 movie is like.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Boys\\" was a film way ahead of its time, mixing various genres (Horror - Comedy - Romance) in a unique blend that made it not only an instant classic, but established a formula for success that has been much copied since. Who would have thought of using a California hippie beach community with a year around carnival zone to serve as the hangout for a group of young vampires looking for a good time. Add to that a couple of wannabe vampire slayers known as the Frog brothers, two oddball adolescents who run a comic book store, and a handsome newcomer in town who happens to be the mirror image of the late Jim Morrison and you have the makings of a cult phenomenon.<br /><br />Superbly filmed, intelligent script with lots of quotable lines, great soundtrack and a wonderful cast of characters featuring; Keifer Sutherland, Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Jami Gertz make for first rate entertainment all the way. However, if you're planning on watching it during dinner DON'T ORDER CHINESE!

0930289528|5.0|Just as George Orwell wanted to entitled his most famous novel, which was published in 1948, 1948 and not 1984, so this amazing graphic novel is more about the emerging political scene in the 1980s of Thatcher and Reagan than about the future, a scene in which individuals were more and more refusing to fight against and mold their government.  Dashing the hopes of the one libertarian reviewer below, the novel very definitely is not an endorsement of libertarianism (which is more an American phenomenon than an English one--e.g., very, very few people in Great Britain have heard of let alone read Ayn Rand).  No, it is about how government can go wrong when we are not the leaders, but the pawns of leaders.  Anyone doubting this needs to reread the preface that Alan Moore wrote for the complete edition:  this is not an endorsement of the free market libertarianism of Margaret Thatcher; it is, in fact, precisely the opposite.  The important British linguistic philosopher and logician Michael Dummett wrote oddly out-of-place prefaces for his philosophical works during the same period, as a devout Catholic with progressive politics lamenting the onset of fascist attitudes wrought by Thatcherism evidenced by new racial laws, expliciting lamenting that his nation had officially become a racist nation.  Moore began his story by imagining Labor winning in 1982, collapsing later due to the pressures brought about by nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, a fascist state emerging from the ruins.<br /><br />V is one of the great figures in recent literature, whether regular literature or concentrating solely on graphic novels.  He is fundamentally a mystery.  We never learn his secrets, perhaps because, as Evey imagines, knowing his secret would somehow trivialize it.  He is a hero, but he is clearly not in the train of the overwhelming majority of comic heroes.  For one thing, he is an anarchist.  If Superman was always at heart a super patriot, V is the precise opposite.  He is an anarchist in the old fashioned sense of William Godwin, not a good Briton.  The images found within this novel of a fascist, totalitarian state truly are the finest since 1984, and one of the book's great appeals is the comprehensiveness of the vision.  V is presented as a political hero, a modern day Guy Fawkes, complete with period costume, but unlike Fawkes vastly more successful in his attempt to bring down Parliament.  Visually, he is a brilliant creation, and David Lloyd's drawing of him are one of the glories of the book.<br /><br />If one reads several of Moore's books, one is struck by the peculiar nature of his genius.  Though he has chosen to work with illustrators, his vision truly is that of the novelist.  The structure and architecture of his creations have the same balance of the finest novelist, and one is constantly amazed at how he has been able to produce a narrative that can be perfectly captured by illustrations.  But in the end, the illustrations do not carry the narrative; instead, Moore's narrative provides the structure for the illustrations.  I don't like to throw around the word \\"genius,\\" but there are times that I think it aptly applied to Moore.  Yes, David Lloyd does a spectacular job with his illustrations, but book after book written by Moore with different illustrations one detects something glorious, and it is hard to imagine that he isn't utlimately esponsible.<br /><br />As Moore points out in his preface, this was his first effort at a long narrative comic, and there is some roughness at points compared with some of his other efforts such as WATCHMEN or FROM HELL.  Nonetheless, one can't help but be impressed by the overall grasp of the story.  This may be his first sustained work, but it is hardly the work of a novice.<br /><br />Many will be aware that this is at the time that I write this review being made into a major feature film starring Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith of THE MATRIX films and the star of the greattransvestite film PRISCILLA OF THE DESERT) as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.  As a rule, very few graphic novels have survived the conversion to film.  GHOST WORLD and SIN CITY are two exceptions that prove the rule.  Previous Alan Moore conversions--in particular THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAODINARY GENTLEMAN, though not even FROM HELL can be accounted a success--have been ghastly.  Rookie director James McTeigue worked as first assistant on both the final STAR WARS film and the last two MATRIX efforts, the latter interesting because V FOR VENDETTA is cited as an influence on the original MATRIX.  I have two hesitations about this appearing in film form.  First, most films based on graphic novels are simply awful, and the thought of the producers destoying another great story is painful.  Second, masks work well on the printed page, but not so well in movies.  I have enjoyed the Spiderman movies, but the masks get in the way of any human expression, not just with Spiderman but with the Green Goblin in the first film.  I'm fearful that V will not be as successful onscreen because of facial immobility.  Hopefully the filmmakers will be aware of this problem and will compensate accordingly.<br /><br />This is one of the few graphic novels that I would strongly recommend to anyone wanting to explore the genre for the first time.  It is a wonderfully told story with several compelling characters and story lines.  And it contains one of the most charismatic heroes in all of the comics.of the great transvestite film PRISCILLA OF THE DESERT) as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.  As a rule, very few graphic novels have survived the conversion to film.  GHOST WORLD and SIN CITY are two exceptions that prove the rule.  Previous Alan Moore conversions--in particular THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAODINARY GENTLEMAN, though not even FROM HELL can be accounted a success--have been ghastly.  Rookie director James McTeigue worked as first assistant on both the final STAR WARS film and the last two MATRIX efforts, the latter interesting because V FOR VENDETTA is cited as an influence on the original MATRIX.  I have two hesitations about this appearing in film form.  First, most films based on graphic novels are simply awful, and the thought of the producers destoying another great story is painful.  Second, masks work well on the printed page, but not so well in movies.  I have enjoyed the Spiderman movies, but the masks get in the way of any human expression, not just with Spiderman but with the Green Goblin in the first film.  I'm fearful that V will not be as successful onscreen because of facial immobility.  Hopefully the filmmakers will be aware of this problem and will compensate accordingly.   <br /> <br />This is one of the few graphic novels that I would strongly recommend to anyone wanting to explore the genre for the first time.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I loved the whole album, her voice is fantastic, the songs are soulful and rockish. I would buy her next cd in a sec. by the way she is in herbie hancock's new cd \\"possibilities\\".
068987474X|1.0|I bought this book expecting to be drawn in with witty writing and relevent stories.  I just could not get into it past the first 2 pages, and the book has been collecting dust ever since.  Pretty cover design though, and good title. Still, money wasted as far as I'm concerned.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Like others have said this album will have to grow on you. What it still retains is the wonderful and vulnerable lyrics. What If is a great song that really does speak to alot of people's insecurity when they get married. Kingdom Come is an excellent closer and has even more meaning knowing it was meant for Johnny Cash. Yes this album is a little more dense and as things go it holds it own with past cds. For those debating the simple way to look at it is you like Coldplay sound and want more so then buy the CD. You don't like Coldplay sound, or are getting tired of it then I would choose not to get this cd. Its the same old in the long run so you either like it or not.
B000002MP2|5.0|If you were between the ages of 13 and 18 when this CD came out you owned it.  Simple as that, this CD and \\"Nevermind\\".  \\"Dookie\\" gave the teenage ears a much needed break from other records out at the time including Ace Of Base's \\"The Sign\\" which was made up of a dozen or so songs with the same backbeat but different lyrics.  This CD signalled a true return to punk rock as a popular genre which continues to this day.  I guarantee you that if you have a used record store by you this CD will be there.  It used to be entertaining back in the 90's to see friends try to sell this CD back because they generally already had enough copies to fill an entire rack.  I bet all those people wished they had never sold it now.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent.  Brad Pitt was outstanding and the supporting cast superb.  Where it broke with the Illiad, the story line only rose above the ancient script and perhaps let you see what actually happened as in the case of the death of Achilles. Brian Cox was outstanding as a truly villainous Agamemnon and Sean Bean did service to the role of Odysseus.  Overall a great flick.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a Greatest Hits package. Hardcore fans will wish it had some rarities included, or that songs were included that they didn't like but these packages are marketed to consumers who don't own all the original full length CDs. As such, it is a good set.     [...]
0312319517|5.0|Lemme confess: I'm the kind of highbrow snob who spends most of my time with certifiable literature and thinks he's better than the rest of you.  Consequently, I have precious little time in my schedule for superficial thrillers and spy-genre outings.<br /><br />Just my luck, though.  I have a friend who's into precisely this kind of stuff and is always pushing some inane book or another on me.<br /><br />Sadly, I am unable to categorically reject everything he hands me, since he once gave me a copy of Forsyth's \\"Avenger.\\"<br /><br />I was pretty blown away:  it's a really gripping novel, and wading through it is akin to taking a course in international politics in the late 90's!  The plot is supremely credible, the characters well drawn, the atmosphere taut:  everything here is well worth your time.<br /><br />The ending, I felt, was utterly preposterous, but so what?  It's certainly one book I was not sorry to have spent time with.

0930289528|5.0|I found this, on my second read, more timely than the first.  A Nazi dictatorship in England where the goverment denies citizens liberties and claims national emergency as their excuse.  A land where the press is controlled by a group intent only on preserving the status quo.  How could it be more timely.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|As a majority of the other reviews state, this is a wonderful movie. Incredibly funny and innovative. Stephen Chow is a genius, be sure to catch other films he has both directed and starred in, such as Shaolin Soccer. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, if you watch this movie with English audio, you will NOT experience the movie everyone else loves so much. Watch it in Chinese with English subtitles first!  <br /> <br />It's one thing to adjust the script so that the voice-over synchs up to the actor's mouth. It's another to COMPLETELY REWRITE the script. The people responsible for this dub should be blacklisted from the entertainment business. Not only is the voice-acting filled with horrible acting and lame accents that don't fit the characters, but they changed most of the dialogue and added things they thought would be \\"funny.\\" The movie's original Chinese script, which is translated nicely in the English subtitles, is what you were intended to see. The English audio is like an amateur writer's attempt at making his own \\"Kung Pow,\\" by \\"spicing it up\\" with jokes they think are funny. <br /> <br />The changes made to the script in the English audio version are inappropriate. Not to mention that these changes will confuse the viewer (for example, the line \\"Where's the car?\\" was changed to \\"Where's the limo?\\"... there were no limousines in the 1930-40's). Had the English voice actors simply read from the subtitles, it would be a tolerable way to watch the movie. But, the dubbers \\"improvised,\\" thinking their brand of cheesy accents and lame embellishments would appeal more to an American audience. And that is an insult to the audience's intelligence. <br /> <br />The original Chinese audio is superb, and the actors are wonderful. It doesn't matter if you speak Chinese, you'll get it, and you'll see the characters the way they were meant to be seen. The subtitles are simple and easy to follow. Do yourself a favor and pretend that this DVD didn't come with an English audio option.
B00006JDVV|1.0|One of the most colossally idiotic monster movies I've ever seen!  The people responsible for it ought to be flogged!<br /><br />I suppose the idea of a bunch of dragons having taken over post-Apocalyptic London was serviceable enough, but the thing that really sunk the movie was the script's insistence on throwing technology into the mix.<br /><br />Uh, helicopters in a post-Apocalyptic age?  I hate to be the one to point this out, but helicopters (and tanks, for that matter) require an infrastructre of modernity and civilization to keep them going:  replacement screws, gaskets, dials, cylinders . . . not to mention the specially refined petroleum!<br /><br />Where are they getting all this stuff?  Western civilization's been kaput for over 15 years!  Ebay?<br /><br />And you're telling me they jump out of helicopters to ensnare the dragons with nets?  And that the dragons feed exclusively on \\"ash\\"?  Brother!<br /><br />I wanted to hide from the movie, not the dragons!  (Too bad their fire-breath didn't torch the script before it could be filmed.)<br /><br />Also:  The idea of the one \\"bull\\" dragon who has simply been impregnating all these females?  Sheesh!  The poor creature would be too exhausted to take wing!<br /><br />And the script's attempts to create interest by stirring up pseudo-conflict between the humans was unconvincing and silly.<br /><br />Matthew McCaunaghy sure does look cool with a bald head, though!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Many doubted that Coldplay could match the success of Grammy-winning 'Clocks', but with X&Y they have raised the stakes. Just about every song is single material, an accomplishment that has spawned criticism that the band has \\"sold out\\" with \\"music for the masses.\\" I'm still wondering how making music that so many people of all ages and nationalities enjoy listening to is a bad thing.
0071410945|5.0|A Technique for Producing Ideas  by James Young is a concise quick read. I found it to be memorable. <br />Some reads can be overwhelming with too much imformation , this was not the case with A Technique for Producing Ideas. <br />It's one of those books that you want to re-read, and being under 50 pages make it painless to do. <br />But don't take my word for it read it yourself.
B000000H7I|4.0|What can one say, that hasn't already been said, about the most imitated band within the death metal genre? Suffocation have influenced legions of bands who have came after them; and after 15 years, they have been able to maintain their status as the most brutal band in existence (a direct quote from legendary producer Scott Burns), literally leaving all others in their dust. Furthermore, they remain at the pinnacle of death metal music and continue to be the band that all others seem to aspire to, but can never quite surpass.  <br /> <br />With that said, \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" remains THE defining album of Suffocation's illustrious career, not only for the band, but for death metal as well. Below is my analysis of what makes this album a \\"must own\\" for any true fan of death metal. <br /> <br />1) Sheer brutality. As hard as any death metal fan may look, a more brutal album simply will not be found (though \\"Demigod\\" from Behemoth is slightly more intense and manages to be a little faster). \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is relentless, raw, inaccessible, and brutal death metal to its very core. At the risk of resurrecting and tired and overused clich, I must say that if one were to look for the meaning of death metal in the dictionary, \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" would be the album referenced in such a definition. It contains all of the elements which characterize death metal: (a) growling and indecipherable vocals which will amaze the listener that a human being could maintain such a prolonged assault on the vocal cords - Frank Mullin is truly a gifted death metal vocalist, (b) sheer speed which never lets up, and (c) down-tuned guitars played with a precision technicality that could split hairs (solos included). <br /> <br />2) \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" manages to highlight the talents of the band members to the nth degree. All of the individuals who make up Suffocation are truly accomplished musicians, and should serve as a reference for any death metal fan seekingto defend the genre against attacks aimed at stereotyping extreme metal musicians as lacking talent and capitalizing on nothing more than simple power chords. Suffocation is truly a band of accomplished musicians...period! As a matter of fact, it was Suffocation who defined an entirely new subgenre of extreme metal now known as \\"brutal technical death metal,\\" and it was \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" which served as the album that launched this brand of music to all who would dare to listen. Of course, fans know that this music caught on in the death metal underground, and placed Suffocation in their rightful thrones as the kings of an entire genre. Nowadays, it seems that, not only is Suffocation the most emulated band within extreme music, but they seem to be the most referenced as well, as evidenced by countless reviews of other death metal bands/albums comparing them to Suffocation. <br /> <br />3) Perhaps the best compliment I can pay to the band in this review is the fact that \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is an enjoyable album to listen to (if you love extreme music). I often find myself listening to the album in its entirety when I decide to place it in my CD player. One thing I want to elucidate; however, is that \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is an extremely brutal album. Anyone who is new to death metal and looking to purchase an album to orient him/her to the genre may want to look elsewhere initially, as \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is not an easy album to listen to if one is not familiar with the stylings of death metal. However, to any true death metal fan, \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" is the quintessential album to own, and should be on the shelf of anyone who calls him/herself a fan of extreme music. <br /> <br />As is typical of my reviews, I must point out that no album is perfect. And \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" does have a flaw - minimal variation and uniqueness between songs. Many of the songs on the album, though very good, sound similar to one another. This is unfortunate, because such a flaw is egregious, especially for a band as immensely talented as Suffocation, and therefore serves as the basis of my deducting  star and not giving the album a perfect rating. In addition, the similarity among the songs serve as the primary reason I listen to the album in its entirety without giving preference to a single song. Though collectively, \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" plays as an outstanding album, unfortunately there is no single song (or songs) that stand out. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that all of the songs sound exactly alike, as enough variation does exist for a fan accustomed to death metal to differentiate between songs. Despite this, each song fails to have it's \\"signature stamp\\" which will make it immediately recognizable upon initial listening. However, I feel that it is worth noting that with the later release of \\"Pierced from Within\\" Suffocation proved they can write insanely brutal songs and retain the uniqueness, distinctiveness, and variation among each song that makes an album truly great.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, despite the obvious flaw I most definitely would call \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" a \\"must own\\" album. As I mentioned before, it is the album (and Suffocation is the band) that launched the brutal death metal movement that has become so emulated within the last decade. Suffocation are truly the kings of death metal, and are likely to be for some time to come. <br />
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Unfortunately, the same thing that makes it so highly watchable the first time around (variety of spectacle) prevents it from entering the realm of truly great films.<br /><br />There's a lot here to admire:<br /><br />*  You get a really convincing portrayal of what life must have been like on one of those tall wooden ships:  the battle scenes, the becalmed sea, even the social status of the child lieutenants!  The movie also does a fantastic job of conveying how much of a true craft it must have been to sail such ships.<br /><br />*  The (chamber-music based) soundtrack is superlative and entirely fitting.<br /><br />*  I always wondered what it would look like to sail through the Straits of Magellan.  Well, here you go!  (How interesting that the filmmakers never actually went to sea at any point during the production!)<br /><br />*  The subplot with the ship's surgeon trying to inspect the fauna of the Galapagos Islands is strangely compelling.  It was the only thing I came to care about during the latter half of the movie!<br /><br />*  As if all this isn't enough for you, the \\"weevil\\" joke alone is worth the price of admission!<br /><br />But, as I say, the movie stops short of being truly great, since, when you get right down to it, it doesn't seem to have anything to say about human experience.<br /><br />Fans of Patrick O'Brian's have informed me that the movie is more or less an amalgam of several different O'Brian stories weaved together for the film.  Well, it shows.<br /><br />Because, although the film has many intriguing and well-done elements, in the end, it's not really about anything.  Duty, perhaps?  Too bad the filmmakers didn't have a more coherent conception of what they were trying to say.<br /><br />But certainly worth watching once!
B0006399FS|4.0|It's interesting the way that reviews ebb and flow here on this site.  There seems to be a lot of parrots aboard the good ship Amazon these days.  I would ask anyone considering the reviews here to actually read them, compare, contrast, and come to your own conclusions concerning their credibility.<br /><br />While some of the reviews slamming this CD seem to be relatively thoughtful and coherent, many--and perhaps most--of them seem to be crude and inchoherent.  This gives those reviewers and their reviews a severe lack of credibility, in my opinion.  On the other hand, many of the best written and most intelligent reviews here seem to grade this CD somewhere between good and utterly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />I believe this CD is neither as perfect as some seem to believe it is, nor nearly as horrible as others are saying.  It is what I would call a \\"flawed masterpiece.\\"  Some of the tracks, especially \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" (an emotional tour de force), \\"Original of the Species\\" (beautiful, shimmery, heartfelt), \\"All Because of You\\" (sounds like U2 circa 1980), \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" (upbeat love song to NYC), and \\"Yahweh\\" (anthemic rocker) rank right up with the very best songs of U2's career.<br /><br />The ubiquitous \\"Vertigo\\" is certainly a great grabber, and we can't hold its overexposure against it. (We can, perhaps, blame U2 for that, with the continual iPod ads, but really, that's got nothing to do with the song or the album as an artistic statement.) I will say that \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" grates on my nerves, and is the only major flop on the CD.<br /><br />Everybody has a right to their opinion, whether they want to throw out 1 star or 5.  But, at the risk of sounding a little too schoolmarmish here, I wish more folks would put some thought into their reviews and their ratings before they hit the save button.<br /><br />As for me, I love the CD and continue to listen to it regularly, even after all these months.  In some ways, I love it even more now than I did when it came out.  If you haven't heard the whole thing (beyond just \\"Vertigo\\"), give it a chance and you won't be sorry.ome ways, I love it even more now than I did when it came out.

0385510454|3.0|This novel takes off like a rocket, but soon falls to earth.<br /><br />Let me encapsulate the story: Once upon time there was a Washington DC power broker named Joel Backman, who became involved in a highly shady internation technology deal that landed him in Federal prison, an outcast from his profession, contacts and friends. Six years later, the CIA convinces a lame duck President in his final hours in office, to pardon Backman in a complicated plot to flush out enemies of the US who were involved years earlier in the incomplete transaction for which Backman was incarcerated. Backman goes in one single night from inmate to semi-free man, and is transported to Italy, where the CIA makes him think he is being taught to blend into a new, secret life. The truth of course, as we know but Backman does not, is that the CIA wants him as a decoy to draw foreign agents to destroy him.<br /><br />The friend who recommended this novel to me has a track record for recommending some fine works. (You know who you are, Hugh.) The first forty pages of The Broker were so exciting and addictively inviting I didn't doubt he'd sent yet another fine read my way.<br /><br />But then....something bad happened. John Grisham forgot all about the plot I described above and mired himself, his primary character, and most of all his readers, in a sometimes charming but eventually tedious assortment of scenes set in Italian eateries.  I kept waiting for something significant to arise from these endless meals but nothing ever did. The plot does revive a little in the last fifty pages, but with nothing like the force it had at the start. Before I was done with The Broker I felt like someone had switched books on me and exchanged my thrilling political novel with a tour guide of the best cafes of northern Italy. Which is a shame, cause Grisham started off with the kind of edge-of-your-seat story that doesn't come along very often.

1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's \\"A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a brilliant novel of mystery. The great mystery addressed, however, is only loosely connected to a certain dog-related happening. It is the mystery of how the mind of an autistic child works and how the world around him reacts. The plot of the novel is virtually irrelevant. The beauty of \\"A Curious Incident\\" lies in the behind the scenes look, so to speak, of the autistic mind. <br />   The boy's innocence contrasts with the danger he poses himself and others, building an almost painful tension that characterizes the novel. Haddon has an incredible understanding of the logic and thoght processes of his narrator, making for a fascinating read. <br />  The adult dialogs, however, feel forced and scripted, and the plot occasionally branches out into the rediculous.  <br />   Nonetheless, \\"A Curious Incident\\" deserves most of its praise and manages to be a great read to kill time on a flight without sacrificing any literary creativity.
006097625X|3.0|I know this is tantamount to HERESY in the world of comic book lovers, but McCloud's a bit... well... NUTS.  His books are very interesting, sometimes though-provoking reads, but he's not writing for academes.  A good, strong, critical look tells me that this man is writing for those who already agree but aren't well enough trained in argumentation to make their point.  It's about 30% fluff, which is fine, but McCloud is an extremist, and as such, know what to expect.  He is a big voice, and he's good at what he does, but to create a piece that truely could have an impact on any serious academic, he needs to be more critical and impartial.  His bias is overwhelmingly powerful.  Don't get me wrong--I agree with the man whole heartedly!  But preachin to the choir just gets you a bored choir.  Well, maybe not for those less concerned about convincing someone outside the industry.
B000008LH5|4.0|I bought this CD hoping to recapture the experience of a live Alvin Lee/Ten Years After concert.  I have seen them twice, both times in large venues, and they put on a show that must be seen and heard to be believed.  Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons and company simply exuded so much energy.  Those guys in concert were on a musical level that few others seem to attain; some rock performers half their age (or less) would do well to learn from the true masters of their craft.  Professional musicianship, fantastic guitar riffs, LOUD and rocking all the way!  However, my copy of this CD seems to be lacking in sound quality (even when I crank up the volume).  To be sure, all the right songs are there, and the band is playing true to form (i.e. excellent), but the sound is just \\"thin.\\"  Maybe I just got stuck with a poor copy.  Alvin Lee and TYA deserve 5 stars, but in all honesty I must rate this CD down a notch.
0375714669|5.0|I've read Maus, the graphic novel describing the holocaust as experienced by the author's parents, now living in Queens, NY.  Reading the two volumes of Persepolis reminded me somewhat of Maus.<br /><br />There are very touching moments, expressed in minimalistic graphics, and few or no words, that convey so much, about intimate relationships and family life.<br /><br />In Maus, the single frame of the father taking his son's coat out of the metalwire coat hanger and putting it instead on a wood hanger, and saying that he doesn't put his son's coat on a wire hanger, but deservedly on a wood hanger, was so meaningfull, and beautifully expressed.<br /><br />In Persepolis, the happy couple that just got news of their successfull admittance to the state university and loking for a place to hug and embrace each other, well, because they are not married, such affection cannot be done in public, thus, without speaking, they jump into a car and drive off, looking for seclusion, and while driving, a hand is on the gear switch handle, and the other person's hand is on top of that hand.  No words.  Yet, beautifully conveying the message.<br /><br />And moments of utter sadness and death, so difficult to say, yet they are said, with no dialogue, yet, so effective.  The scene of the party, stormed in by the revolutionary guards enforcing the morality code, are chasing a black & white silouette on the rooftops, under a white crescent moon.  The silouette is shown to jump from one roof to another.  Then it is shown to fall between two buildings.  Death of a friend.  All said with no words, just a few minimalistic black & white frames of silouettes, building rooftops, a crescent moon.<br /><br />The author has experienced great contrasts.  And the medium she chooses, black and white graphics, is a perfect choice.  There are several scenes in which the opposites are placed one next to the other:  \\"the way I am\\" next to \\"the way he sees me\\".  Or \\"the way I wanna be\\", \\"the way the morality code wants me to be\\".  At a moment while reading, and thinking about the choice of B&W graphics, I thought it would be brilliant if the author then used the reverse image, as in a photographic negative, to display the sense of absurdity.<br /><br />I hope the author continues on the genre, possibly visiting the iranian community in the Los Angeles area, or raising kids in France, teaching them Farsi, then visiting Iran regularly with the kids, and documenting how her kids interact with the kids raised in Iran.  Those five-year-old kids raised in Tehran will spot that something is wrong with the five-year-old kids raised in Paris:  \\"you speak like an eskimo\\", possibly noting that the Paris-based kids are speaking Farsi that is not at the eloquent and fluidity of the Tehran-based children.<br /><br />Looking forward for future installments.way the morality code wants me to be\\".

6305657947|2.0|This is more a sex movie than any kind of robbery cum cat and mouse game.  To call it a cat and mouse game is absurd, it started out that way and lasted for about 15 minutes, then the clothes came off.  The only good thing I've got to say about it IS the sex, both characters are very natural and childlike about exposing themselves.  This I like.  The first robbery made no  sense except the hero ended up with the Monet.  Then 2 endless hours of romance and tiffs.  (I preferred the detective.)  The plot had a couple surprises.  No more than that.  The water that washed the paint off the Monet would also have damaged it.  The first theft (the hero's part in it) was about as exciting as this flick got except the mix-up with the bowlers and the suitcases at the end, which lasted about 5 minutes or less.  The picture tried hard to be classy and sophisticated, but these sudden decisive or definitive gestures and movements (slapping the keys into the cop's hand, tossing mysterious envelopes into people's laps with a flick or a flourish, etc) all reminded me of the te-da-DUM! on a drum after a joke on the old Carol Burnett Show.  And as for the keys, supposing the hero was deaf and insensate and couldn't hear or feel his keys being taken out of and dropped back into his pocket, how did he drive our heroine to the restaurant without them?  Finally, the last robbery was just impossible, and when and how did he return the Monet.  This movie was a mess.  A lot of boring pseudo-sophistication and sex between 2 fairing interesting if implausible art thefts.  God what a drag!
0393316041|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud, as well as stop and think about some of the problems he mentions. Definitely a must-read for anyone who has more than a passing interest in math and physics!
B0009MAO46|5.0|The real icing on the cake here folks is that Pixar/Disney are including a DTS-ES soundtrack on this new edition of \\"Toy Story\\" - essentially it's the first US release of a Pixar DVD with DTS sound!!!  Not only will this DVD look good, but it will sound fantastic.
B000089RVX|4.0|I have to admit, when I bought this CD over two years ago rock was certainly not my preferred genre of choice.  However, that soon changed as I listened to this CD.  The style is so different from any other bands that were out at the time.  It's dark, mysterious, and Amy Lee has a killer voice.   <br /> <br />1. Going Under- I feel that this song is a great one to begin an album with.  The first verse lets you get into the music without being hit by pounding guitars from the very beginning.   <br /> <br />2. Bring Me To Life- After hearing a radio version that had all of Paul McCoy's parts edited out, I've really come to appreciate the album version.  It works so much better, and, being their first big hit, it leaves no illusions as to what the band is about.   <br /> <br />3. Everybody's Fool- I like how it starts out soft and acoustic before the rest of the instruments come in.  The storyline is different than most of the other songs, and I also like how the bridge is toned down, too.   <br /> <br />4. My Immortal- I do believe that the radio version is better, with the guitars doing the instrumental instead of the violins, but it showcases Amy Lee's talent, and is a very beautiful song.   <br /> <br />5. Haunted- Very interesting piece.  I love the sound, it's extremely minor and spooky, and the guitar solo is great.   <br /> <br />6. Touniquet- While the lyrics are something unheard of in music today, I admire the band for writing a song like this, and I love how the violins take over at the end and make it sound so mournful.   <br /> <br />7. Imaginary- Good song, fairly \\"averags\\" in sound, (meaning, simply, that there isn't much that stands out), except for the guitar part in the middle.   <br /> <br />8. Taking Over Me- Another good mix of quiet and loud, and it certainly is a bit happier sounding than a lot of the other songs.   <br /> <br />9. Hello- Will make you depressed on a rainy day, I guarantee it.  I love the fact that it has a cello solo, but it can get a bit draggy if you're not in the mood.  Great vocals, though.   <br /> <br />10. My Last Breath- I really like this song, especially the five-note guitar riff before the chorus.  Another interesting mix of highs and lows.   <br /> <br />11. Whisper- A good song to end an album with, although the chanting at the end is a little odd.  I like how the strings compete in the finale, and the guitar solo is good, as well.
B00005QG9J|5.0|So this is Nu-Metal huh?  I ignored this band and the others that fall into that genre.  I gotta get out more often. I figured they were just another bunch of talentless punks who knew little or nothing about making real music; real art.<br /><br />I heard Meglomaniac on my daughter's radio station when I got my car back (for a day) and thought that was awfully good and then forgot about 'em.  Someone loaned me this CD and one night, when very bored (I work in Tempe AZ during the week but live in Tucson AZ), I gave this a spin.  What a great record this outfit has put together here.  Aqueous Transmission is downright beautiful with the flowing but dreamy progression and vocals accentuated with Japanese flutes and... is that a koto I hear in there?  A creative surprise.  This is truly excellent.<br /><br />There are plenty of rowdy, heavy moments on this release but it is well thought out music that reminds me a lot of some of King Crimson's music though not as rhythmically complex as that outfit.  Still,it's above the cut.  There are also some more laid back, introspective moments.  I'm playing this one a lot.<br /><br />Is this a CD for you?  I don't know, my tastes are very eclectic (see my other reviews) ranging from John Lee Hooker to Elliott Smith; The Shins to King Crimson; Miles Davis to Eric Dolphy; Neko Case to Stravinsky; Bob Dylan to Wilco.  My standard is pretty much this, if it comes from the heart,it is worth at least a listen and, if it's very good, I pull out my hard-earned wad of cash.  I pulled out my hard-earned wad of cash for this one.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I can't really add anything to what's been already said!!! <br /> <br />I personally think it's their second best effort (Exile on Main Street being the first) & has some of their best tunes, Gimme Shelter, Country Honk, Let it Bleed, Monkey Man, You can't always get what you want. It was also their second of four consecutive classic albums, the other previously being Beggars Banquet, whilst Sticky Fingers & Exile on Main Street were what followed!!! <br /> <br />So if you like rock, add this to your damn collection now!!!!
0156012197|5.0|This is a wonderful book for children of all ages, including adults!  It has a wonderful message but doesn't read like a \\"message\\" book.  I first read it in school in French, and have always remembered both the French and the story!!  I highly reccomend it.
1559408758|5.0|It is pretty weird to have three great comedians taking they mickey out of something they clearly love doing - making music . <br />It's the type of music made by Spinal Tap that they're having a go at , or is it rock and roll , or is it the inflated egos of people who don't realise that they can't act a certain way forever ? <br /> <br />But , I'm forgetting the point here . <br />This will always be one of my favorite films and the Criterion DVD has a commentary with the main actors as themselves , whereas the MGM DVD features them in character . <br />The Criterion DVD also has another commentary track with Rob Reiner on it , plus some of the technical crew . <br /> <br />This has become a rare DVD , but the MGM DVD will do nicely while you're saving up for the Criterion version . <br /> <br />If you are a rock musician ( I know some people feel those two words don't go together ) , you will love it. <br />It is a great creative endeavour and says as much about the dynamics of relationships as it does about being in a band , which is a special feeling .   <br />Buy , laugh and enjoy .
B0006399FS|1.0|Yeah, we got real tired of their disgusting selling out too. We all did. But what should be more troubling for U2 fans is not the quartet's commercialism (something that these guys have flirted with the new millenium) but the inflation of their faith - religious and otherwise - into pop music's own insipid answer to the self-help industry.  <br /> <br />In a sense, the members of U2 have always flirted dangerously with didacticism, but their beliefs tended either to manifest themselves in the context of particular world events (\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\",\\"Pride\\") or create platforms from which to ask larger, more troubling questions (\\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\").  <br /> <br />But with their eleventh full-length, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, and its predecessor, 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind, these self-assured Irish troubadours are voicing their prophecy with world-encompassing tastelessness - and sounding more like MTV and iPod representatives than true musicians.  <br /> <br />U2's empirical self-satisfaction, their steadfast belief in the power of love and reason in the face of the world's horrors, has undercut the propellant power of their music. The Edge's instantly recognizable chiming guitar transformed the The Joshua Tree's spiritual yearning into a sound that defined a decade, and his constantly shifting, brooding psychedelia formed a fitting backdrop to Bono's ironic turns on the world-weary Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop. The strongest in U2's catalogue, these records were about asking questions or - wondering whether it was even worth asking them in the first place - and their music solidified this abstract desire with soaring melody and restless rhythm.  <br /> <br />Now, on \\"Miracle Drug\\", a song with musical roots planted firmly in that familiar sound, a self-assured Bono proclaims, \\"Of science and the human heart/ There is no limit\\". With Atomic Bomb's confidence, U2's music, despite its anthemic pedigree, has lost preciselyall that claim to universality it continually makes lyrically.  <br /> <br />Moreover the overused predictable Edge's guitar work or the completely uninspired Larry Mullen's \\"keep the rythm\\" drumming, it's simply much easier to record than new boundaries of music, all that, of course with Bono's struggling broken and fake \\"poingnant\\" voice. It's all a trademark name, all marketing, and no new music at all. <br /> <br />With longtime collaborators Brain Eno, Steve Lillywhite and Flood trading off duties behind the boards, the production sounds immediatly unexciting and outdated. U2 can't manage to recall the glories that made them one of the most important bands of the last quarter-century anymore, no matter how they pretend to be \\"the biggest band in the world\\" by trying to look like Zoo TV.  <br /> <br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is just the only one good song. The Edge pulls out a blissfully languid slide guitar line as Bono paints a festive picture of an evening lost to nostalgia and the temptations of a city where \\"the more you see the less you know\\".  <br /> <br />But the majority of Atomic Bomb isn't about taking ANY risks; it is, like its title, an instruction manual for the 21st century. Its blandness is all the more frustrating because so much of what made U2 so singular - their brash sincerity and endlessly churning instrumentation - has returned in full bloom. But rather than capitalize in the album's ripe musical moments, Bono and the boys seem content to dish out platitudes rather than songs <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|Then u either haven't heard it or the CD shop u brought it from gave u the wrong CD.  <br /> <br />This is an amazing CD, I mean it 200%.  <br /> <br />The opening song (not available on any greatest hits by the way) Rocks Off can't get it out of my head, the next few tunes at first pass by but still they are great, then comes the hit single Tumbling Dice, classic, and my personal favourite on the album Sweet Virginia.  <br /> <br />There are other great moments too Happy is a typical Stones rocker, whilst Stop Breaking Down, Shine a Light, the final track Soul Survivor are excellent.  <br /> <br />It is The Stones best, and a great starting point for anyone new to their albums.  <br /> <br />If u loved this u can also try:  <br />Beggars Banquet  <br />Let it Bleed  <br />Sticky Fingers  <br />and  <br />Some Girls <br />
0440238609|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this trilogy, although at times I found myself feeling mildly disturbed by the anti-religious sentiment that strongly resonates through the stories.<br /><br />Pullman masterfully entwines reality with fantasy, melding two worlds that are so very similar and yet so completely different, taking the stories of the two main child characters and interweaving them into one monumental adventure/quest.<br /><br />The first book The Golden Compass (known as Northern Lights in Australia) introduces us to Lyra, and the world of people and daemons (creatures that are inextricably joined to their human counterparts). The second, The Subtle Knife, introduces Will, who comes from a world where the daemons of Lyra's world are not physically manifested. The third book, The Amber Spyglass, brings everything that was set up in the first two books to a spectacular and dramatic conclusion, dealing with the potential destruction of both worlds.<br /><br />The books are very much a worthwhile read, and Pullman writes in a cohesive and engaging style, with plenty of fascinating characters, and weird and wonderful places. If you can ignore the overtones, it is a very worthwhile read.
B00005JNTX|3.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a live-action graphic novel that adapts 3 of Frank Miller's books for the big screen: \\"The Hard Goodbye\\",\\"That Yellow Bastard\\", and \\"The Big Fat Kill\\". Actors were shot against a green screen, and all of their environment is computer generated imagery. The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it. The film is high-contrast black and white with splashes of color. The visual style might be described as a caricature of classic film noir's low-key lighting. The story takes place mostly at night, often on shiny, rain-soaked streets. There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2-dimensional pages of a book. In fact, the entire film is a caricature of classic film noir, although Frank Miller and co-director/editor Robert Rodriguez are lesser visual stylists and bigger romantics than the artists of classic film noir.<br /><br />We are presented with three stories whose single common element is a bar called \\"Kadie's\\". Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) has tracked an 11-year old kidnap victim to a city warehouse, where she is in the clutches of a perverse murderer (Nick Stahl) with powerful political connections. Hartigan can outwit and outgun the murderer, but defeating the corruption behind him will prove more resilient. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a psychotic, intensely violent ex-con. When his girlfriend Goldie (Jaime King) is murdered, his search for her killer leads him to the dungeon of cannibal-murderer Kevin (Elijah Wood) and up the chain of corruption. Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a barmaid at Kadie's, is trying to get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie (Benicio Del Toro) in favor of the better-mannered Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight follows Jackie into \\"Old Town\\", a red light district ruled by the prostitutes who live and work there, with the intention of ridding  the world of Jackie's menace. But the ladies, led by Gail (Rosario Dawson), have Jackie in their sights as well.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is the second feature film to place actors in an entirely computer-generated environment, and it suffers from many of the same limitations as 2004's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\": one-dimensional characters and visual tedium. Like \\"Sky Captain\\", \\"Sin City\\" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes. After that it's dull, dull, dull. I was intrigued by the idea of CGI films for a while, but, having seen 2 of them at this point, I have to say that they cannot create anything close to the visual interest of photography. \\"Sin City\\" is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one. The characters are one-dimensional and thoroughly unengaging. They all have the same personality, and they all do the same thing. The droning of incessant voice-over narration is so grating that I found myself tuning it out. The project might have fared better as 3 short films, which would break up the visual and narrative monotony.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life \\"Sin City\\" does that -more literally than for its own good. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma. But they are the only actors who do. These characters and storylines are not nearly sophisticated enough for a feature film, and neither is the CGI. \\"Sin City\\" is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes. I was profoundly bored. Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game. You might have better luck if you consider it a live-action graphic novel instead of an actual film. Robert Rodriguez said, \\"I didn't want to make Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City'. I wanted to make Frank Miller's 'Sin City'.\\" And so he did. The trouble is that Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" is not cinematic. Note that the film is ultra-violent and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The DVD (Dimension 2005): The single bonus feature is a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" (8 1/2 minutes), which features interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, \\"guest director\\" Quentin Tarantino, and some members of the cast. They talk about the vision behind the film, but there is no discussion of technical details. Odd that we don't get more bonus features on a Robert Rodriguez film, but there it is. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish. Captioning available in English.

B00006JJ51|5.0|\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is one of the most influential and important rap albums of all time, allowing a whole new wave of gangsta rappers to speak their views on gangsta life in Compton. The crew features Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E, Yella and Dr. Dre, ultimately the most significant, and blatant crew to ever set foot in the rap industry. Although their lyrics seem a little overblown at times, and rather comical, there is an obvious deliberate statement this group was intending to put across.<br /><br />\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" features some very authoritative, direct rhymes towards police, sex, crude violence, and life in the hood, but due to the funky beats, comes across as fairly inoffensive material. The first three tracks all boast awesome, groovy beats and explore a plethora of controversies. \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" maybe carries the best rhymes, with intense and ever-so-smooth lyrical deliveries. Each rapper has a fairly distinctive voice and delivers the rhymes perfectly. The self titled track has beats changing smoothly and very effectively as the crew shouts about CPT. This album is very consistent, however offers a great deal of variety in lyrics. Highlights for me include the slower paced \\"I Ain't Tha 1\\", the self titled track, \\"F-ck The Police\\", \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\", \\"Parental Discretion Iz Advised\\", \\"If It Ain't Ruff\\", and \\"Quiet On Tha Set\\".<br /><br />Overall, this album has it all. The funky hardcore beats, explicit, ridiculous and amazing lyrics, and a fantastic crew of rappers. An absolute essential for fans of old-school rap, and also highly recommended to fans of rap in general. It is disappointing to see what Gangsta Rap has become, but thankfully NWA's music still exists.
B00006AW2J|5.0|The one thing you can never accuse The Rolling Stones of not having was balls & Sympathy for the Devil is one of the most ballsy songs of all time, and that's just the beginning of the brilliant Beggars Banquet album, released in 1968 was the first of four consecutive Stones classics, it was the beginning of a truely golden period for the band!!!    The next song is the mellow No Expectations, followed by the bluesy Dear Doctor (a style that influenced alot of The Stones music). Parachute Woman is another classy blues rock track whilst Jigsaw Puzzle is a rebel song, about...Grandma's. Street Fighting Man is perhaps the second most famous song on the album aside from Sympathy for the Devil, whilst Prodigal Song is a short 3 minute mellow track. Stray Cat Blues is classic Stones blues whilst Factory Girl is a mellow gem timed at only 2 minutes 9 seconds. The album ends with the middle class anthem Salt of the Earth & There you have it, another 5 star Stones album!!!!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|One of my all time favorites amde better with added footage
6304711905|5.0|This is the movie that is at the top of my list for several years.<br /><br />I love this film and had to buy the DVD because I wore out the tape I had of it! This is Val Kilmer's best role he has played.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie you are doing yourself an injustice.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|...I asked my fiance to marry me with this CD playing softly in the background.  Everytime we listen to a song on it now, it takes us right back to that Easter night.  It's a great disc, and I personally like the acoustic disc even better.  Perfect for long car rides, romantic nights, or any time at all. Worth every penny.
B000000W5P|5.0|Well actually it would turn out to be their last great album, and at the time their first for six years (the last being the 1972 masterpiece Exile on Main Street). But in that time music had changed dramatically rock was out of fashion & punk and disco were all over the radio. Whilst most rock bands decided to go against this & eventually faded away The Stones decided to embrace this new wave of music!!! <br /> <br />Indeed there are great examples of both genres here, but both are given that extra Stones treatment, to put it simple The Stones embrace the new without loosing the old, Some Girls is just as rockibily as their previous & indeed one could claim that it might be their most heaviest album with tunes such as When the whip comes down, Lies, Get out of my life. The album also contains songs with the typical Stone's riff hooks, the discoesque top ten hit Miss You, the other hit Beast of Bearden & the brilliant Shattered. There are also softer moments such as Just my imagination, & Before they make me run, whilst the title track Some Girls adds humour to the album!!!! <br /> <br />Overall Some Girls is another classic Stones album, and perhaps one of their most diverse (well other than Sticky Fingers & Exile on Main Street) some may also find it their most enjoyable album & all power to them. So at the end of the day there's nothing like spending 40 or so minutes on a Rolling Stones boogie, is there!!!!
B00004YA66|5.0|Some movies you can't wait for to get over, this movie leaves you wanting more when it's over. It's a fantastic ride between a father and son in a constantly changing plot. I have watched this movie a half dozen times and each time I am wanting to watch it again.
0792839730|5.0|Operation Market Garden was Montey's grand assault into Arnhem, Holland (The Netherlands).  It was a grand Ground and Airborne campaign that was only trumped by its massive failure.  After watching this movie and studying a little bit about the overall operation you will come to understand how ineffective airborne troops are as a main offensive weapon. <br /> <br />This was a great war movie plain and simple.  It stuck as close to the actual history as best as possible.  It had an ensemble cast that really brought this movie to life.  I originally watched this movie prior to going on the second of two staff rides (Military field trips).  I was a lowly Specialist amongst knowledgable officers.  Our guide/military expert was impressed with my knowledge of what happened here.  He actually asked the Brigade Commander why his driver (me) knew more about this operation than any of his staff officers.  An excellent companion to this is the book Arnhem 1944: Operation 'Market Garden' (Campaign, No 24) by Stephen Badsey
B000000W5N|5.0|Yeah, we all know The Rolling Stones are a great, and with over 210 million albums sold world wide there's tons of people who also know this as well. This review is therefore for people who are not familar with The Rolling Stones work, or maybe new to this rock music, so I've decided to give you some life saving advice. <br /> <br />1) Because an album doesn't have catchy la la tunes, or ain't played on the radio like 50,000 times a day doesn't make it crap!!! <br /> <br />2) Maroon 5 are not a rock band!!! <br /> <br />3) There's nothing wrong with listening to music that's older than you are, there is something wrong listening to music that's meant for people who are much younger than you (aka 3 year olds)!!!! <br /> <br />4) Slipknot, Limp Biscuit, or all that other crap you hear on kiddies radio that's called rock, isn't rock neither!!! <br /> <br />5) Do yourself a favour, buy this album, once your educated enough buy some more Stones, some Led Zep, The Who, and discover music that goes beyond kiddies Pop!!!! <br /> <br />6) Sticky Fingers is a classic album, did I not mention that!!!!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|WOW! If you think the trailers were good, this film is fantastic. There were several times I jumped during the movie. This is a true modern day thrill ride, and edge of your seat experience that will leave you watching you back for weeks to come!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is a must see for everyone, especially those that have seen Saving Private Ryan.  Although I like the movie it follows a fictional storyline and sacrifices reality for hollywood in several parts. <br /> <br />This series does none of that.  It is based off of the book written by the Ambrose, the eminent historian.  Best of all it gives many interviews from the actual stories that this is based upon.  Looking at the Real person and then seeing the actors portraying them on the screen was almost scary.  You would swear that each actor is the grandson of the person they are playing. <br /> <br />Follow the story of Easy Company from basic until the end of the European campaign, you won't regret it.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|yes, its true, bale was boring in this. heck, the whole story was boring. i felt like hollywood was trying so hard to up beat this franchise while i was watching this, i just couldnt by into it. this is not about batman. its about bruce wayne. and theres hardly any batman in it. cmon. hollywood, dont you know that you can make a serious batman AND have batman in it too? guess not. heh, maybe the sequel will be cool. i mean, its gonna have joker (i hope). the villians were boring in this one too. and whats with these nolan-ites (i like to call them that) putting down keaton for? he was a great batman, and IMO is the still the best. i really had high hopes for bale but he just didnt click with me. his bruce wayne was good, but his batman really went into the deep end. keaton hardly spoke, and when he did, it was staright foward and sound badass. bale just wouldnt stop talking, and the way he made his lips move like when in the scene when he was talking about the \\"panicinducingtoxin\\", can you say \\"marble mouth\\"? the cowl was on his face too damn tight, and it annoyed me. he could hardly turn his head, even after all the hype he barely could move at all. and whats with this \\"microwave emitter\\" crap? what was it? what did it do? it took me 3 viewings to figure that out. its simply just canon. also, i just wasnt diggin the batmobile in this film, again, ANOTHER huge change i didnt like. it was TOO BIG, not sleek and cool like the 1989 batmobile that keaton drove. NOTHING beats the keaton car, for me at least. there just wasnt anything i really liked about this film except some of the performances, like michael caine and gary oldman (though he wasnt much different from past roles). the \\"origin\\" was fine, but i guess i just wanted a bat- movie that wasnt overly campy with good story and batman action, this was just TOO much bruce wayne and WAY too much katie fricken holmes. she was just horrible. pissed me off most of the time. just like these keaton haters are. dont listento them. there just goin along with the crowd. keaton is the best batman and im pretty confident you feel the same way. keatons voice was deadly and cold, while bales was just blabby and \\"oh i had to much to eat, thats why im talking funny\\" voice. bale also over-did the \\"angry\\" thing, like some stupid annoying goth kid, annoyed me. and what was corny was the way they shot those \\"swooping\\" scenes where bale would \\"swoop\\" from the top of the cave to the bottom, oh brother! and whats with this lucious fox guy pretending to be Q from james bond? ugh. and why do i care where batman gets all his stuff, duh, he works at wayne enterprises! he can get anythging he wants!! it doesnt take a genious to figure THAT out. hollywood is just trying to spoonfeed the audience WAY to much in this movie, acting like we're stupid. ugh. bale simply couldnt top michael keaton as the dark knight in my eyes, and i just didnt get the same fun, awsome feeling that i got/get when i watch the burtons films. and bales \\"im batman\\" simply couldnt match with keatons quiet, controlled \\"im batman\\" from 89. bale was doing a bad ripoff of keatons line, we i agree with the below poster, he OWNS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />in short, i give this a three for good performances by the actors, but not my favorite bat -film and not what i expected from a batman movie. at all. keaton is still my favorite and maybe in the sequel, bale will prove me otherwise.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I watched this movie at a friends request and honestly I could have done without it. The story itself was interesting, but with most Ferrell movies they throw various things in there that have NO reason to be there.<br /><br />I love comedy movies, but I had a hard time finishing this movie...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Okay, this album is worth every cent. The stripped album is as good and some tracks on that one are even BETTER. You will like Gavin DeGraw unless any type of music with drums in it gives you a migraine. He is just as good live as he is on his cd. You will fall in love with him because once you listen to his songs, you can relate. And he doesn't act like he is above us all like some other artists of this age do. When you meet him, he's just like a regular guy...very nice, so sweet, and simply amazing.  <br /> <br />This cd is all I have been listening to for over a month, no joke. I haven't listened to anything else. <br /> <br />every track is so good, and he does AMAZING covers of marvin gaye and many more! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />GAVIN IS THE BEST!

B00005JKCH|4.0|I was never a comic book fan as a kid, yet I still knew who Spiderman was (don't we all). So, I felt compelled to watch this film. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. I really enjoyed this movie. A fun action packed ride. Certainly one for all to enjoy.
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|Adam Sandler is an a@@. He is anything BUT funny.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I had been toying with the idea of watching this movie for awhile and finally relented and watched it. I like the actual 'behind-the-scene' story in how the war started, but the modern day story seemed rushed and there were a good many possibilities wasted on this movie.<br /><br />To me this movie seemed to want to showcase how 'cool' special effects can be and how Hollywood prop people can make monsters look real.<br /><br />All to often lately the move ends with the appearant sequel already ready. This is the case with this movie as well. Although, this movie does close one of the plot lines - but not much more than that.<br /><br />If you like the gothic look and are a sci-fi/action fan give this one a shot, butdon't expect an epic tale as it won't be had here.

B00008EYA5|4.0|I went into this film expecting another cop shooter, which is fine. However, I was left with a sense of greatness. I am not saying this is a top 5 film in the action enre, but it certainly is a must see for action film fans. A lot of fun and worth watching over again.
0767817664|5.0|After twenty years Fright Night remains one of the best Vampire films of the last couple of decades and still scary.  A perfect film to watch on dark nights.  What makes the movie go is the very believable characters.  Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a typical teenager.  He's a horror movie fan and maybe a bit of a nerd.  When a new neighbor moves in next door Charley becomes convinced he is a vampire.  He tells his friends Amy (Amanda Bearse) and Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) but they think he's nuts.<br /><br />Peter tries to enlist the aid of an old horror movie host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), the vampire killer, but he thinks Charley is crazy too.  Eventually they all try to humor him by going to the house to meet the new resident Jerry Dandridge played by chris Sarandon.  It's all kind of a joke to everyone until Vincent looks in his little mirror and sees that Dandridge does not cast a shadow.  With the realization that Dandridge really is a vampire Vincent wants to flee the town.  Meanwhile the vampire now comes after Charlie and his friends, kidnapping Amy and taking her to his old, gothic looking Victorian.  Charley now has to rescue Amy and figure out a way to stop the Vampire and his servant Billy Cole.<br /><br />Fright Night has a great atmosphere and is really a throwback to old classic Universal and hammer films which relied on great suspense and atmosphere over blood and gore.  The scenes as Charley and Vincent stalk the vampire in the house are truly scary as is Charley's final battle with Dandridge.  William Ragsdale and Chris Sarandon are fantastic in their roles.  While Ragsdale was actually in his early 20's at the time, his young appearance made him believable as a teen.  Bearse was even older at 26, but still pulled off her teen character.  Chris Sarandon exuded sexuality as the vampire Gary Dandrige but was equally menacing as well.<br /><br />A great film!
B000001FKY|5.0|This is a great record, it sounds very very polished, and well done. I will admit that Def Leppard is not heavy metal and some would argue that they are pop/rock, but the in the words of Phil Collen, Def Leppard is \\"rock-plus.\\" This album sounds like \\"rock plus.\\" I didnt get this album right when I got into heavy metal, but none-the-less I love it. This album has some of Leppards best songs on it, regardless if they were radio hits or not. If you are just getting into the 80s metal scene or have been a fan for a long time, this is a great album to start with or add to your collection.
0062502182|1.0|Paulo Coelho is at the same time a fatalist, a Christian, a Hegelian, a Platonist, a prophet and a divisive author. <br /> <br />fatalist: Maktub: it is written. Our lives become controlled by fate. 'the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected and we are to know everything, because it's all written there'. <br />Christian: the main character in this book is a shepherd. Shepherds were the first to recognize a king (Jesus). <br />Hegelian: 'The world is one. The principle that governs all things is called the Soul of the World in alchemy.' <br />Platonist: 'this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise.' <br />prophet: 'Everything in life is an omen ... left by God along his path'. <br />divisive: 'Allah created the armies.' <br /> <br />A few questions: <br />What's the sense of realizing one's Personal Legend and one's Master Work, if everything is already written? One has only to discover those? <br />If the world is one, are war and peace one? <br />If this world is a copy of paradise, are there also atombombs in paradise? <br />If 'every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world', what's the role of terrorists, warmongerers and murderers? <br />If 'our life stories and the history of the world are written by the same hand, wrote that same hand 'good and evil'? <br />If 'all things are the manifestation of one thing only' and if 'love is the pure Language of the World', why is our hero nearly all the time surrounded by warriors created by ...? <br />If 'every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity', is this also true for the victims of poverty, famine, wars, diseases ...? <br /> <br />This book is an amalgam of cheap and contradictory FM symbolisms. <br />The last sentence says it all: 'I'm coming, Fatima.'
B000002H6C|4.0|This is a great cd and the people who think this is music for depressed people obviously are on some kind of drugs. Sure the songs on the cd are really heavy and loud-I got this cd and when I listened to and at first I was skeptical about if this was the cd that I wanted to buy. Then as I listened to the songs I realized that it was a great cd. I think that this record would help people get through tough times with friends and/ or family. Pretty much the only bad thing about this cd is that it has guitar solos that are WAY too long. I would recommend this cd to any heavy metal fans.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a very experimental album by The Beatles. This is where they started to use drugs and came up with ideas that would soon go into their greatest work of Sgt Pepper. What I consider the best song on the album is \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". John wrote the song using the book of the dead. One of the most famous songs on the album is \\"Yellow Submarine\\" even though it is not one of my favorites. This album is a must have for any true Beatles fan.
B000002INR|5.0|This is album that got me into metal as we know it. It pushed me to buy albums by such bands as Motley Crue, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica. Sebastians vocals rock, especially in the song \\"I Remember You\\". Youth Gone Wild, Big Guns, and Piece Of Me are the best off this album. 18 and Life is a power ballad with an attitude. All other songs on the album are great as well. If you are just getting into the whole heavy metal thing this album is a great place to start.
B0001I55OC|3.0|I got Michael Crichton's book when it came out, but don't really remember enjoying it. I've forgotten most of the book details but when I caught this movie on TV a day or so ago it was immediately obvious that a major rewrite of the contents had been done. I missed 20 minutes or so of this version but what I did see I think I liked better.  <br />I tuned in just as the team was about to go back and rescue the Professor and stayed through the rest of it. It seems to me that the book plot was an ongoing time travel program, not a freak opportunity like the movie, and- in my mind a flawed depiction of time travel by comparison. Crichton wrote something like each trip back was it's own reality then violated that plot by having his professor leave a message which shouldn't have been possible if reality changes when you travel. This plot cleans that up it seems and didn't have too many faults that I could see. <br />Here apparently too many trips can be very unhealthy and a previous timetraveler (with too many of those trips) has remained behind (he was marooned without a marker(?) and decided to be one of the bad guys.  <br />Our heroes journey back with three or four unarmed marines and only one french speaker, the language guy and two marines promptly get killed by English invaders. The last(?) one- who was responsible for marooning bad guy is killed by him later. The set and costume detail looked very good to me, I didn't really have a problem with much of anything except that the whole story (the trip back, the Professors rescue and the return home)seemed to take place within only about 6 hours. <br />It barely resembles the book which seems to offend some but Timeline is a pretty good way to spend a couple of hours. I think it is worth owning.
B000000OQF|5.0|When I got this cd I was totally blown away. The bands song writing on this album is one of the best Ive ever heard!! The songs on this cd reflect the bands life in L.A.. Its awesome to hear the song Sweet Child O Mine in the midst of all the sex, drugs and rock n roll that is the rest of the album. This record is one of those that you can listen to over and over and not get sick of it. Between Axls song writing/singing, Slash and Izzys guitar, Duffs bass and Steves drums- Guns N Roses have created one the best rock n roll records ever!!!
B0002VL6ZA|4.0|As a guitarist myself, I have a soft spot for guitar-oriented bands and the Eagles for one were lucky enough to have a whole bunch of very good guitarists.  Don Felder who was responsible for practically all of the title track, Glen Frey, the second track, Joe Walsh, made all the tracks that little bit better and Randy Meisner on bass.<br /><br />The work that Felder and Walsh do on the first track, especially the solos (Felder the first and Walsh the second part, both at the end) and that familiar harmonised ending to the main solo was just inspired stuff.  Ditto the guitar work on &#34;Life in the Fast Lane.&#34;<br /><br />Overall, the sound quality of this Japanese disc is quite good although not great but good enough.  4 stars because of this and because my favourite Eagles tracks it just so happens are not here (&#34;One of These Nights&#34;, &#34;I Can't Tell You Why&#34; and a few more)but that doesn't make this a bad album.  Have to admit to suffering from having listened to too much of the first track over the years and that's probably why the rating suffered.<br /><br />Maybe you don't have the same hangups so why not get it and see for yourself?  Cheers!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is a great CD but not the best one! This is probably my <br />favorite debut album of all time! This CD along with every Dire <br />Straits album except Communique are great. This album was released in 1978. Making Movies was released 2 years later. <br />Anyway there are 2 tracks I always skip on this CD. Here's how <br />the songs are on this CD. <br /> <br />1. Down to the Waterline - I love this song! I like to repeat <br />this 3 times in a row. This is a great album opener. It is also <br />a big big hit. I think the vocals, guitars, and drums are amazing. Listen to it, and repeat it over N over again. <br /> <br />2. Water of Love - This track I feel is a little too slow for <br />me. Anyway it's a good song, beautiful. <br /> <br />3. Setting Me Up - I think this song has some great guitars, <br />and great vocals,& drums and another one you need to repeat. <br /> <br />4. Six Blade Knife - Very great song - the lyrics are great, <br />drums are great, and another one of those tracks to repeat <br />over, N' over again.  <br /> <br />5. Southbound Again - The shortest song from Dire Straits. It is <br />3:00 long. Anyway it's good. But not the very greatest. <br /> <br />6. Sultans of Swing - The most popular song from Dire Straits <br />behind my other favorite Money for Nothing. This was their first <br />biggest hit in 1978. Great song with great guitars vocals and drums, another one you need to repeat. <br /> <br />7. In the Gallery - No review available <br /> <br />8. Wild West End -  No review available <br /> <br />9. Lions - Great album closer with great drums and great vocals. <br />and guitars too. This is another song you can repeat. <br /> <br />Any new Dire Straits fan must want this record first because <br />it was thier first CD. Like this album? I reccomend you some <br />other albums from Dire Straits that you havent heard. Here's some other songs from Dire Straits that you've heavent heard yet <br /> <br />MONEY FOR NOTHING <br /> <br />HEAVY FUEL <br /> <br />SKATEAWAY <br /> <br />TUNNEL OF LOVE <br /> <br />TELEGRAPH ROAD <br /> <br />
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This has to be the ultimate Blondie best of cd that's out there.  The sound has been remastered to near perfection and all my favourite tracks are here; even \\"Island of Lost Souls!\\"  Fairly representative of what they have done throughout their career and appropriately ending with \\"Maria\\", their last big hit.  If you are looking for a great compilation of this band's work, this is it!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This is a pretty good soundtrack of such a crazy/fun musical. This cd contains most of the musical highlights from the film. There is some variety in styles that keeps me finding myself listening to it over and over. There are a couple songs from the movie that I wish were included in the disc and its obvious to say a lot of people felt the same way. You can get the second Moulin Rouge soundtrack for those.
B00005JKN9|4.0|This film chronicles the struggle between Irish immigrants and \\"native\\" Americans during mid-19th century New York. Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is killed in a bloody stuggle between the immigrants and the \\"natives\\" (led by Billy Cutting, played by Daniel Day-Lewis). Years later, Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), plots revenge for his father's murder. Cutting, unknowing, takes the young Amsterdam under his wing, practically adopting him as the son he never had. Amsterdam, who has never known a father and is starving for familial affection, battles daily with his internal demons.<br /><br />This movie is long, but it is incredibly atmospheric. One gets a true sense of what life might have been like in New york in the 1850's - dirty, crowded, a real struggle for survival, the cacophany of cultures being thrown together in close quarters for the first time, the great disparity between the rich and the poor. And, most of all, how the passage of time erases all of man's great struggles, leaving only slight scars on the cityscape.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio, looking for the first time like an actual man and not some scrawny teenager, turns in a good performance. But the real star of the movie is Daniel Day-Lewis. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought, \\"Geez, he looks like an idiot. Who did costumes for this thing?\\" But when I saw his performance, I was positively blown away. He is absolutely inspired in this film. As a viewer, I felt both attracted to him and repelled by him. His nuanced character is capable of such cruelty, but he is also a man of great principle, and he feels an almost boundless pride and love for Amsterdam. He also has great respect for Priest Vallon, Amsterdam's father. (He feels that they were cut from the same cloth, believing that only their differences in religion separated them.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a great film, and I definitely recommend it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Ive never felt compelled to author an online review. Im more of a spectator than a critic. I purchased this album when it was first released, thank god from above for Amoeba Music Store to waste endless amounts of time sifting through an infinity of music. I had no idea the band would achieve the commerical success they have today. To hear the cd is one thing and to see them perform live is another, both should be experienced. Rather then point out all the songs and the notables of the cd, i will say \\"buy the cd, and buy it now!\\". I hold the song \\"haiti\\" on a pedestal.....Cant wait for the follow up.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I was dragged to the theaters by my brother to go see this movie. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it (action is not usually my thing), but this was far worse than I could imagine. It was actually the worst movie I have ever seen. The longest two hours of my life. I have never read the comic books on which this movie is based on, so I was confused out of my mind. The movie went from one story to another, without any real connection between stories. The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering. This movie is pretty much just violence and hookers. No real story or plot. Just violence and hookers. Like I said, don't waste your money. This movie was beyond horrible.
6301694074|5.0|This is a live performance from the Bavarian State Opera of Mozart's last great singspiel, DIE ZAUBERFLOTE (THE MAGIC FLUTE) conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.  It is my first video of this opera, dating from 1990, and after 15 years of off/on viewing/listening, I am still most impressed with Sawallisch, the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra, singers Araiza, Popp, Brendel, Gruberova, Moll, etc.  The sound, even for VHS, is very good, and I've had much pleasure from this video. <br /> <br />The good news is: according to Deutsche Grammophon's website, Universal will be releasing this video on DVD in October, 2005.  I highly recommend this for the following reasons: great singing by the solo singers and chorus, sensible tempos set by conductor Sawallisch, acting which is appropriate but not \\"over the top\\", beautiful props and scenery, all combine together to make this a feast for the eyes AND the ears.  Sawallisch (born 1923) and forces serve Mozart well, and the message of ZAUBERFLOTE with great dignity and class.  Tempos are never too fast, and if there are a few minor precision problems between singers and orchestra (they are VERY FEW) they are rare. <br /> <br />I recently acquired James Levine/Metropolitan Opera (1991, the bicentenniel of Mozart's death - available on DG DVD) with singers Araiza and Moll from this cast in their respective roles.  I also like Levine, but think his overture is too fast and reckless; his chorus is too recessed in \\"O Isis und Osiris\\", and Kurt Moll (Sarastro) sounds fresher for Sawallisch.  Araiza sounds better for Sawallisch, too, and I like Tamino's clothing better in Munich than New York.  I also like the 3 Ladies better in the opening number, their costumes, method of shooting the monster with pistols chasing Tamino than the MET staging of this scene. <br /> <br />I recommend getting the Sawallisch MAGIC FLUTE DVD when it is released in October.  US release may be later this year; check Deutsche Grammophon/Universal's web site.
0316666343|5.0|I actually read this book a few years ago, but have never forgotten it - it's one of those books that can have a real impact on you!<br /><br />\\"Lovely Bones\\" is about a young teenage girl who was brutally raped & murdered while walking home one day.  It's written from her standpoint - in \\"her Heaven\\" - where she can see the lives of everyone who impacted her unfolding before her eyes.<br /><br />Although one may expect her to be angry for losing her life so young, she displays more of a sadness re: life experiences that she will never get to have - like graduations, weddings, having children, etc...<br /><br />Of course her family is falling apart as the result of the tragedy.  They, each in their own way, have a need to have this killer caught - they need closure.<br /><br />So, will the killer ever be found?  Will he pay for his crimes?  Will the victim help lead the police right to him?  I won't answer these questions because I don't want to ruin it for you.  Suffice it to say that it's an excellent book, and a real page turner.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery, than this books for you!
0330483285|3.0|After a string of mesmerizing works, Banville has produced something quotidian, conventional and unsatisfying.  The character undergoes no profound crisis; the edgy, sinister qualities in many of the previous books is on vacation, and the brilliant style turns a little fuzzy.  After the great shout of \\"Shroud,\\" this book reads like a murmur by someone thinking about something else.  It magnifies the wandering, reflective approach of Eclipse like a self-parody - hopefully this is not a sign of things to come.  I was disappointed - but it still reads better than 99.9 percent of the drek out there.  I'm a great proselytizer of Banville's, but I would not recommend this one.
B000003TA4|1.0|You Nirvana fans are so trapped in denial!  Come on, admit it.  Nirvana (and every other alternative rock band for that matter) were and are a joke!  No talent what so ever.  Nirvana didn't \\"save rock n roll\\".  All they did was make it cool to do everything really half @ssed!  People who think Kurt Cobain was a \\"brilliant songwriter\\" are just fooling themselves.  It doesn't take a brilliant songwriter to put on a flannel shirt and mumble incoherently over a bunch of distorted guitar noise!  I'm sure this stuff sounded cool to a 12 year old kid in 1992, but once you get past puberty, Nirvana just becomes a faded memory!  Nirvana had no talent and was just a passing fad, much like Hanson or the Spice Girls! <br /> <br />Come on Nirvana fans, its time to move on!  This album is VERY dated, and belongs in the Museum of Pop Culture Fads, not in your cd collection!  What a bunch of talentless hacks...
B000000XCH|5.0|i can't think of a beter piece of music to listen to in the summer-or any time for that matter.  this disc has got all forms of american music, features some great hits and generally is one of the best albums every cut.  everybody should own it.
B000002I99|5.0|\\"WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE\\"    REVIEW:     This album marks the first Alice Cooper solo album and it is quite possibly his best. Producer Bob Ezrin -  who would later go on to produce KISS' \\"Destroyer\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" -  does a brilliant job with the complicated arrangements behind this concept album (every song tells a part of the nightmare). All eleven tracks are flawless and it's an album that just gets better and better with age. The title track is the perfect opening number, then Vincent Price works his horror magic (long before he would do it for Michael Jackson) on the track \\"Devil's Food\\" which segues brilliantly into \\"Black Widow\\". Track four is the jazz rocker \\"Some Folks\\" which delves into canniblism while \\"Only Woman Bleed\\" is a beautiful sounding ballad that deals with spousal abuse! \\"Department of Youth\\" is an anthemic rocker which is essentially about rebelliance. The black humor of \\"Cold Ethyl\\" deals with necrophilia while the 'Steven trilogy' (\\"Years Ago,\\" \\"Steven,\\" and \\"The Awakening\\") is fittingly creepy and is sure to make some shivers go up and down your spine. The album is then wrapped up with the upbeat rocker \\"Escape\\".  Brilliantly ghoulish throughout.     MUSICIANS:    Dick Wagner & Steve Hunter ... Guitars   Prakash John & Tony Levin ...  Bass    Whitey Glan & Johnny Badanjek ... Drums   Jozef Chirowski ... Keyboards, Clavinet, Vocals, Fender Rhoads   Bob Ezrin ... Keyboards, Fender Rhoads   David Ezrin and the Summerhill Children's Choir ... Vocals   Vincent Price ... 'The Curator'   Michael Sherman & Gerry Lyons ... Vocals    Trish McKinnon - Mom     INTERESTING FACTS:    1. Released in February of 1975, \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" peaked at #5 on the Billboard Top 200 and would eventually be certified Platinum. The single \\"Only Women Bleed\\" peaked at U.S. #12 on the Billboard singles chart and the single \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" would peak at #45.    2. \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" was the first and only album of Alice's to be released by Atlantic Records due to legal entanglements regarding the Alice Cooper Group and their record deal with Warner Bros.    3. The album was also the basis of a very successful TV special called \\"The Nightmare\\" that featured all the music found on 'WTMN' plus \\"The Ballad of Dwight Fry\\". The special won an Emmy for best editing in 1976.    PACKAGING:    Legendary album cover with only production details inside CD booklet.    APPROX. RUNNING TIME:    41 min. and 18 sec.    FINAL ANALYSIS:    This album is witty, chilling and is truly one of the very best albums of the 1970's. Quite simply, \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is a masterpiece!!! A MUST HAVE!!! ***** out of 5.
B00005JL96|5.0|I am wondering why Disney's studios was not release 2-discs special editon for this movie in USA. However, I found the 2 discs special editon for this movie in Mexico. This item can be seen in the USA because is encode region 1 (USA & Canada) and 4 (Latin America), NTSC format, widescreen, English, Spanish and Portugese Language tracks and subtitles available in those languages. It includes an alternative ending, music videos, behind the scenes, and lot's of more features. The price varies from US$17 to US$24, depending where you get it. I really like this movie, and I am planing to get the part 2 (Stich has a glitch) because includes the DTS soundtrack but I am still wondering if Disney is going to release part 1 in a 2-discs special editon, which I believe could be better than this one or probably the same. I am telling you this because the same happen with Mulan 2, which was release on October 04 in Mexico and February 05 in the USA, Tarzan 2-discs special editon which was release on May 05 in Mexico and is going to be available until october in the USA, other movies just are realease the same date like Tarzan 2, The incredibles, Bambi, and Cinderella 2-discs (on October 05). I got most of my Disney movies in the USA because I lived up there for 4 years and many through amanzon because some features are eliminated when change the language like the DTS soundtrack which is not included in MultiRegion format (1,4). Finally, I can say that I have the 2-disc special editon for Lilo & Stich for less than 19 bucks. bye.
B00004T9UF|5.0|One reviewer refered to this album as a guilty pleasure and I whole heartedly agree...This album is the album you listen to alone in your car and refuse to let anyone you care about know you listen to it for fear they'll lose respect for you.  Kinda like how I own the Justin Timberlake CD...but for compleltly different reasons.  This album is going is a different direction than his previous...he's decided to go with a more serious route (not as serious as The Eminem Show, but more so than The SLim Shady LP)  You can tell there was a lot on his mind when penning songs like 'Stan' about a suicidal fan or 'The Way I am' where he takes a stab at the media and the press.  Even when he's cutting up, he's still cutting up about serious issues that are heavy on his mind.  Songs like 'Who Knew' where he addresses the upset parents over his debut LP, blaming them for their own childrens mistakes.  Some gems like 'Kill You' where he slaughters hookers and then makes reference's to Norman Bates,'I'm Back' where he impregnates J. Lo, 'Drug Ballad' where he watches his daughter Haley get smashed and 'Criminal' where he raves about homosexuals wanting his genatilia all resort back to Em's funny days as well as the first single 'Real Slim Shady' which was an instant hit.  'Marshal Mathers' is a great song taking jabs at everyone from N'Sync to Pink to Insane Clown Posse (HATE THEM)...Em even goes as far as to verbally assasinate a rottweiler.  This brings me to 'Kim', a song where Eminem murders his wife in a little more of a sadistic manor than he did on '97 Bonnie & Clide'...this time we actually hear Kim choking to death and he's chsing her through the woods screaming at her...it's insane...kinda disturbing, mostly because you know you shouldn't laugh but when Kim is screaming and the Em starts screaming with her you can't help but let out a chuckle...anyways, I actually prefered the drug song he put on the amended copy of this CD featuring the SOuth Park gang but then again, Ihate edited music so I bought this one instead.  All in all this CD is great, not quite as good as 'The Slim Shady LP' but very impressive and sure to please any fan of the blonde psychopath.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave have certainly mastered the art of rock!  Strong riffs, Chris COrnell continues to impress with great vocals.  I loved this album!!!
B00000J2PH|5.0|This album is as good today as it was when it came off the vinyl presses years ago.  Carole King's gift for song writing and production are truly amazing.  The proof of her genius is the number of times her work has been reproduced by other artists who recognize and equally admire her work.  A timeless work which merits listening to time and time again.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Before I get to my review for this movie, I would like to say that I haven't seen the previous version, nor have I read the book, so my review is based purely on this movie only without comparing it to anything. The trailers looked intriguing, and since I loved watching Tim Burton's movies like \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Big Fish\\", I thought I would go see `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and I wasn't disappointed one bit! <br /> <br />The story is about young Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Freddie Highmore), a poor boy with a good heart, who one day wins one of the five golden tickets to see Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory (the biggest factory which closed down a few years ago, and where no one is allowed to go in). Now starts the surreal adventures that take place once Willy Wonka shows the winners around his factory. <br /> <br />I am usually speechless after watching most of Tim Burton's films (because they are all so good), and this movie had the same effect on me. I knew Freddie Highmore was talented when I first saw him in `Finding Neverland' and he once again acted his role flawlessly as Charlie. I feel Johnny Depp performed his best in this movie, because apart from the makeup, he played the silly, eccentric Willy Wonka so well that you feel like you are seeing him in a new light. It's not a surprise that Tim Burton would do an amazing job in directing this movie.  <br /> <br />This is a fun movie that anyone would enjoy watching. It is funny, silly, and emotional at the same time. I cannot wait for the DVD to come out so that I can watch it over and over again.
0156027321|5.0|Pi Patel is a sixteen year old Indian boy who lives at the zoo because he is a zookeeper's son and he practices three religions.  Pi is the main character and the story is told from his point of view as he is repeating it to an author who wants to do a biography on him.  At the age of sixteen, Pi finds out his parents are selling the zoo and the family is moving to Canada from India.  Pi is upset, but goes along on the barge they have to take because they are delivering the animals to zoos in Canada.  The ship sinks and Pi, a hyena, a gorilla and a tiger are all stuck on one lifeboat.  The rest of the book is about the journey where only Pi and the tiger survive.   <br /> <br />I chose Life of Pi because my best friend recommended it to me.  It was her required summer reading book, so I figured it had to be a solid book since she not only enjoyed it, but also the school thought was appropriate and important.  It was a good choice.  It was very entertaining, even through the long journey on the lifeboat that seemed like it would never end.  It was a bit humorous at times and I was entertained by the evolution of the lifestyle on the raft.  The twist at the end was my favorite part of the book, it was so unexpected.
0471463396|3.0|Good content and good approach. I'm a fan of value investing. The book teaches the reproduction cost of assets and the earning power value. It also hints on how to incorporate growth.  <br /> <br />The problem is that information is all scattered around and the wording is not very reliable. The authors mix capital with ROIC with ROE. They also don't make it clear when they mean cost of capital or WACC. Also, the definitions are not there and that creates confusion.  <br /> <br />I found a few typos in tables. The values are carried from one table to another and sometimes are rounded sometimes are not. Some entries in the tables just don't mean anything because the values are never used nor referred to. That's a very bad practice for authors coming from academia. They should know better. <br /> <br />The book would improve to a 5-star rating had them fixed all typos, explained all terms, and put all calculations in tables in math formulas instead of just saying something along the lines of \\"we multiply the WACC by the ROIC and divide by the tax rate and we get a P/E of 10.5\\". (Example exagerated). Suggestion: List all the steps so we can follow. Add text to explain whats being done. Refer to rows and columns in the table so we know what values came from where. Also, clearly differentiate between tables with original facts (e.g., balance sheet from annual report) from tables that contain either speculation or derived numbers. Anything discounted or adjusted is speculation or derived.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Rather than bore you with a traditional review of this record, I'm gonna tell you my story of this album.  My brother fell in love with the album almost immediately upon its release (or leak or whatever).  He was constantly at me to listen to it.  I gave it a cursory listen a few times and rather flippantly dismissed it.  He persisted in playing it when I was around anyway.  It grew on me almost imperceptibly.  Then came the turning point came, I had to drive to Atlanta and back (roughly a 10 hour trip).  I had only two tapes in the car YHF and Bob Dylan's \\"Love and Theft\\" (for the record I am an obsessive Dylan fan).  I listened to \\"Love and Theft\\" once.  I continually played YHF on a  loop over and over again.  I came back home and immediately ordered the CD and now have the whole Wilco catolog with the exception of Mermaind Avenue Vol.2.
B000002NAK|3.0|Now, there was lots of potential for this to be a good album. Madonna has a decent voice. And after listening to Colm Wilkinson and Mandy Patinkin, it's quite pleasant to have a Che who actually can pronounce Spanish properly.    But there are problems. The instrumentation is radically changed from previous recordings, and in my opinion is just as heavy-handed as the electric guitars on the original (Julie Covington) recording. Madonna is not as good as she can be, as good as I know she can be-her lukewarm \\"Buenos Aires\\" was a horrible disappointment. And the evisceration of Che's part was a poor choice on the parts of the producers of the film. The weaknesses ruin what could have been a good album. I don't recommend this version; buy the Broadway recording instead.
0060005424|5.0|Unlike Sabriel, which stands alone as a complete novel, Lirael ends on a cliffhanger, with its completion in Abhorsen. This is not a complaint, since the same can be said of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole. More significantly, though, than the continuity of plot in the last two novels, is that the last two novels complete the cosmological implications of the first novel -- elevating this world and its story to something more than merely a cool or interesting place (more than a fantasy), and into the status of significant myth. What I mean by that, is that the story begins to take on larger dimensions than merely a story of a few interesting characters in an interesting world. It becomes a story of the contrast between order and chaos (a dimension in every founding myth), and of the tension between different kinds of order (a tyranny and a democracy are both ordered states). It also becomes (especially in Abhorsen) a profound meditation on the metaphysical dimensions of freedom: something to be seen, for example, in the contrast between the \\"Disreputable Dog\\" and the \\"cat\\" Mogget (whereas the cat is a \\"free magic\\" creature who is bound against his will by the charter; the dog is apparently a free magic creature who has taken upon herself the charter, submitting herself to its ordering principles). While there is a sense in which this is a classic story of the struggle of good against evil, these underlying tensions make it much more interesting. The story thus raises philosophical questions like: is genuine freedom to be unbound? is mastery the only form of power? is order better than chaos? More than just a great read and a well told story, this trilogy aims to provide subtle and interesting answers to such questions.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I am glad I went into this movie completely blind as to what this movie was about.  I recommend you do the same.  Remove yourself from any pre-set prejudices for the duration of the movie to maximize your enjoyment.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this well-narrated and touching movie.  The only thing that surprised me was the fact that Rachel Griffiths was not in the movie.  In certain parts of this movie, the actor who played Hedwig looked exactly like her!  (sorry Rachel!)

0553814826|5.0|I bought this book because I read Susan's \\"Obsessive Love : When It Hurts Too Much to Let Go\\".  In that other book (and others I've read), she talks about how my parents had a big impact on how I was dealing with my relationships.  I felt that if that was true, then maybe it has affected other aspects of my life and wanted to read more about it.  This book opened my eyes about just how much my parents have affected my life, both good and bad. <br />  I have been recommending this book to my entire family.  Aunts and uncles as well as my siblings and in-laws and they have found that it explains so much.  More than that, it helps you deal with it.  I feel so much more in control of my life now that I've read this book and done most of what it has suggested to heal (I'm not done yet, but I'm optimistic for once).  Beyond being in control of my own life, I am much more aware of the suffering in others afflicted by their parents and am actively helping those that will listen.  I firmly believe it should be required reading even for those that have a healthy relationship with their parents so that they can help others overcome their toxic relations.

038533348X|5.0|The reason I chose Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is because my friend Matt Burke recommended it to me.  The protagonist of the story is John and he wishes to investigate how the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was in the house of its inventor, Felix Hoenikker.  He intends to write a book on the topic.  He writes a letter to Newt, the youngest son of Felix, and with that as a starting point, he becomes even more intrigued by the issue.  He decides to travel to Illium, where Felix worked, to investigate his workplace and speak with former co-workers.  After visiting Illium he determines that the best way for him to get the most accurate information is to speak with Felix's other children.  He tracks down Felix's oldest son, Frank, on the island of San Lorenzo and coincidentally on the way there he meets Angela and Newt (Felix's other two children).  San Lorenzo is a poor island ruled by \\"Papa Monzano\\" on a variety of peculiar paradigms.  Monzano is very isck and eventually commits suicide with the aid of Felix's last great scientific invention, ice-nice, an isotope of water that can instnatly freeze things.  You will have to read the novel to be able to find out the thrilling twist with which it ends. <br /> <br />Cat's Cradle was an extremely interesting novel and I am really glad I read it.  Through the telling of this somewhat bizzare story Vonnegut is able to convey some social commentary that i found to be both interesting and true.  The title was very appropriate becuase it seemed to embody the overarching theme of the novel, whcih was that oftentimes humans see things and make things that simply aren't true.  It seemed as if the book was written with a satiric tone, yet it was not intended to be entirely funny.  It highlighted the existance of certain paradoxes that people never take the time to actually think of.  For example, we readily dichotomize between good/evil but what really constitutes each?  Does the man who created the greatest killing mechanism in history constitute being awarded a Noble Peace Prize?  Cat's Cradle invoked critical thought and lead me to explore angles that I otherwise wouldnt have, and thus it was a good choice.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis never seems to quite live up to the hype. I throughly enjoy most of their albums, but they always seem to be reaching, and not quite grasping.  Dont Believe the Truth is no exception. Oasis's worst is much better than most bands best, and just about every song on here is good, but.....if they just would push the envelope a little further, this could have been a classic. The one thing that irks me about this album is the length of the songs. They are well-written and produced, but, for example, The Meaning of Soul, a great song, but they cut it off just when its gett'n good.  I mean, they could've developed it a little more. The Importance of Being Idle, though, is almost perfect. And I also wish they'd gone a little, tiny bit heavier, not so much pop, more rock. Sure, of course they sound kinda like the Beatles, or more specifically, John Lennon, but what's wrong with that? They can write a great hook and a great harmony, and have more talent in their pinkies than just about any other band on the charts. I think maybe, just a little, well, lazy. I just wish they would have worked on it a LITTLE more. Too much drinking, boys.
B000002KKS|3.0|This album is one of their best. If it weren't for Ronnie James Dio, Black Sabbath would have faded out, \\"into the void\\". He refreshed a band that had been playing live and recording for over a decade, having not received the \\"hit status\\" and recognition they deserved.  <br /> <br />I believe it was for the best that Ozzy Osbourne left the band when he did. With RJD, the band was rejuvinated; except for Bill Ward, maybe. Bill Ward didn't support the album on tour. He does play great on this album. To date, it is one of his best efforts with the band. Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi both shine.  <br /> <br />The song, Lady Evil, is a throw back to Technical Ecstasy's, Rock and Roll Doctor! <br /> <br />I think that the lineup could use RJD, again. One more album and tour for 2008?  <br /> <br />It would be a fitting end to the Black Sabbath story.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|When I can listen to a CD and break out in a huge grin, you know they have hit the spot.  Petrucci lays down some incredible guitar work, some of his best.  He has put much more thought into his solos on this one, compared to Train of Thought in my opinion. The man can go from some of the chunkiest chords to rippingly clear solos that are clean as a whistle.  I'm wetting myself! <br /> <br />Jordan Rudess is really getting hot too.  Also some interesting little noises here and there.  It's a musicians field day!  To the Crespo guy, that is bashing every DT CD since SFAM, as well as every other piece of music he reviews, I say go watch movies instead.  You apparently don't like this killer stuff, so don't buy it.
B000005RFQ|2.0|I bought this album on cassette years ago. I have it on cd. It is okay. It has some good songs on it. The title track is my favorite. After that, Zero The Hero, Trashed and Keep It Warm (rats?). <br />  <br />If you are new to Black Sabbath, start somewhere else.  <br /> <br />We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll, maybe? Better yet, start with, Reunion; work your way from there! <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Robt Hive/Exodus could be argued to be Clutch's best album.    The band never ceases to amaze, as they reinvent their sound on every new album, taking songs to new levels, yet maintaing their signature sound throughout.  There isn't a bad song on the album.  Every one is on point.  Some heavy, some groovy, some strange, all quality.  Musically outstanding, lyrically genius as usual.  Clutch is, in my opinion, one of the best bands currently touring in the world.  If you have any of Clutch's other albums, this is simply a must-buy, no doubt about it.  Get your evolution on.
B000002KDO|4.0|All the tracks on this album are great!     Tony Iommi is one of the top ten guitarists.    If you or someone you know does not listen or has never heard Black Sabbath, get this cd.     One of the heaviest albums of the decade (the 70's). I was a baby  when it was released. I may have not been born. I was born again, in my late teens, listening to Master Of Reality.    Sweet Stuff!!
0596007124|5.0|Let me add my glowing praise to everybody else's for this book.  I've been programming for a long time and pretty much thought I knew it all... then this book changed my whole perspective! <br /> <br />As someone who has long espoused Object Oriented principles, I was shocked at how little I really understood their true vale.  Simply knowing (and using) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and the like is not what OO is really about -- it's about writing solid, flexible, maintainable, and all around _good_ code... and that's exactly what this book teaches you.  I feel like my eyes have been opened to the true beauty of OO! <br /> <br />Initially I was skeptical of the style and layout -- a far cry from the dry academic text in most programming books.  It definitely made the book interesting, but I was shocked at how thorough it was...  Every question I had was answered within a few sentences of when it popped into my head (even those rhetorical \\"I wonder...\\" questions). <br /> <br />The examples are in Java, but I've had no trouble applying the principles in my C++ and C# work as well.  Whether you are trying to keep your job from being outsourced, or you just love programming, this is a book that you shouldn't be without.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Time was when I could honestly say I had all Tull's alblums -- but that was back in the days of vinal...  BUT - If you can only have one Tull alblum -- this would be the one too chose. They cover all the early great tunes and the spirit (I don't know how else to say it...) of Tull really comes across in this live performance.    I'll be honest however. I've got this alblum on vinal. and I've got the origional CD. The orginal CD had one HUGE GLARING PROBLEM .. and that was they chopped off Ian's intro to Jack's In The Green. I'm hoping that with this \\"Remastered\\" version they've fixed that. It was a classic moment that shouldn't be lost.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is an excellent cd. The songs are soulful and meant for interpretation. Some of the lyrics are a little goofy and juvenile, but the majority of the lyrics are smooth and fluid. The best songs on the cd are Chariot, Follow Through, and Just Friends. I Don't Want to Be, is a great song, but so overplayed by the radio, I can barely stand to hear it. Overall a great album and a flash of what's coming with this spectacular artist.
0780020685|5.0|This is the best film ever.  Nothing i say could drive that home anymore, and if you haven't bought this movie yet,then just drive to the store and pick it up.  I would like to express my hatred of the individual known as Sean \\"Dragon Ninja.\\"  He should not be able to review films, because he obviously never even made it out of grade school.  So all I can say to you Mr. Dragon Ninja is: EAT SHI# AND DIE.  You call yourself a ninja, how pathetic.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Some of the negative reviews below are off the mark.  Story was engaging and characters were interesting. Stunning animation. The best.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|The collection is awesome but the package tends to scratch the DVD media. Amazon did replaced the original set but even the second one came with a scratch caused by the package. I suggest to remove and store in standard jewel cases.
B000063DFN|5.0|Oh mama! this album is it. the opener of aces high > 2 minutes are a maiden flurry of excitement! then the instrumental losf'r words is awesome and highlights steve on the bass. flash of the blade and back in the village are great little rock tunes. the 2 power songs to close out the album are vintage maiden at its best. Powerslave is a great lengthy song where in the live version, a mummy eddie comes out and walks on stage for awhile. Rhyme is a 10+ minute choon that is based off some book. It contains a middle section akin to that of seventh son of a seventh son
0895260131|5.0|This book is just straight on correct. I used to follow Islam and I know what Mr. Spencer is talking about. This isnt fantasy people..its the real deal. There is a hidden world infidels are not going to see unless they really look. I read some of these negative reviews and they made me laugh out loud! I challenge these people to pick up the Koran and become part of the Islamic community, but be careful. You can not speak on behalf of Islam until you have been part of it. Mr. Spencer is correct..its not paranoia, its the truth.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This is the type of music that I play for my patients in the clinic as they are having acupuncture treatments. It is very relaxing while also touching the soul on deep levels - very moving and gentle on the spirit.
0375751513|5.0|A great classic.  It's better the second or third time.<br /><br />Dorian Gray, a fabulously good-looking young man with a poetic glow about him, starts out innocent and pure.  His more worldly acquaintances spoil him with many observations on how wonderful it must be to be young and fabulously handsome.<br /><br />Reflecting on his own beauty in an amazingly like portrait of himself, his obsession becomes never growing old.  The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish.  Now only the portrait will show the effects of age.  And the stains on his character.<br /><br />For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty.  All the other important things in life fall away.  Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering.  Neither does he.<br /><br />There are some passages that might appear wordy.  There are many moving and inspiring passages, if one takes the time to reflect on them.<br /><br />This is a great book.  Your teenager will probably be assigned to read it in middle-school or high school; you should read it too.
0385338686|4.0|Oh my god - I am reading this book laughing hysterically out loud! The ironing scene was priceless.  I can relate to Samantha's situation.  Highly recommend for lots of laughs!!!
0060920084|5.0|I ran into this book in a bookstore in The Hague (NL) on my way to buy a  new Lonely Planet for my upcoming trip to The States. Indeed I am a great fan of the USA. Until that time I had never heard of Bryson but reading the back cover in the shop the first sentence of the book ('I come from Des Moines... somebody had to) directly caught my attention. That must be fun to read!!  <br /> <br />Reading this book during the last weeks Bryson really surprised me with his very nonconformistic way of writing. His observations are very sharp and really refreshing!! Never a dull moment for the neutral, not 'over-americanized' reader. Normally I don't laugh out loud when reading something funny in books but this one was a cracker and during the 350 pages of this book I did it over and over again. And hey there all you Americans out there who feel offeded by Bryson or find his observations offensive for the people of the Midwest and all the other (obesive)Americans Bryson discribes: don't be too proud on your country and your compatriots. When travelling in Europe you can expect the same from the Dutch, the Germans , teh French and Italians for instance. Dont we all make a laugh at our curious habits! Just see it as a wink Bryson gives to the life he lived (and obviously still lives). And remember that there is a huge difference between cynical (but humourous!!)memoirs and abusive stories! I enjoyed it a lot and love the country side of your country even more! But yes, not everything in America is something to be proud of but is'n't that the same for every country...;-))). Conclusion: a very good buy! And I will definitely buy another book (Walk in the Woods should also be fun as I read the reviews) of Bryson in the coming weeks. And come back to the US over and over again for LA or NY, 'Amalgam', your National Parks and all the places in between.  <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|Just as the cover art shows! RAW, RELENTLESS, REAL metal! Phil, Dime, Vinne and Rex held people hostage with this cd. It holds you down and pummels your eardrums! REVENGE!  WRONG!<br /><br />RIP DIME!
B000AA4LAK|2.0|Don't let my rating fool you, I like The Killers and when I bought Hot Fuss shortly after its release I liked the material. However this is a flat out bad \\"limited\\" edition. We'll have to wait and see if it is truly a product that will only be produced for a short amount of time. With the amount of extra material that The Killers have it is better to just by the extra tracks from itunes(napster, sony connect, etc.) and save yourself the money. The three tracks are good but nowhere near worth rebuying the entire cd. So If you don't already own Hot Fuss then this is a good purchase, however if you already have the cd then don't buy into the band/record label just trying to keep themselves relavent and make more money.
B000002JR8|5.0|This recording RULES! Checkout Yahoo! for the video for I'm Broken. IT IS INTENSE!
0375405380|5.0|Don Winslow is one of the best writers around that no one has ever heard of.  His books become more and more ambitious and this is the best yet.  Combining characters from Hell's Kitchen, churches and whore houses with aristocratic Mexican drug lords, this book is violent, gory, suspenseful and--most important--beautifully written.  Highly recommend.
B00000DFSK|1.0|Like many of the other reviews, I don't agree with the track listing, as well.  Four songs from 'Rattle And Hum' are too many, and the albums 'Boy' and 'October' are completely under-represented.  The new single, 'The Sweetest Thing' is thoroughly disposable; it sounds like filler.  And I despise the edited version of 'Where The Streets Have No Name'.  This is the song that got me into U2 in the first place, and I believe the guitar lead-in and the matching guitar fade-out at the end are the most magnificent guitar pieces The Edge has played in any of U2's music.  To cut both ends of the song short like the edit version does is nothing short of a tragedy.  Usually, you would recommend a greatest hits collection to a friend who was just starting to get into a group, as an introduction to their music.  I would not, however, recommend this collection.  It is not a true representation of the beauty and brilliance that is U2.
B00001MXXH|3.0|Almost any movie can be a kind of Rohrschach test, I suppose.  What does it say about me that I didn't particularly care for FERRIS BUELLER.  Or to be more precise, that I did not care much at all for Ferris Bueller, the character.  A latter Tom Sawyer, as some have indicated?  Well, perhaps.  A prankster figure in the classic mode?  Well, certainly a prankster, just how classic a one is subject to debate.   <br /> <br />And to frame that debate, why not start by defining our terms?  \\"Prankster\\" or \\"brat\\"?--that is the question. Does Ferris hold an ironically, distorting mirror up to society, and help his friends to realize some kind of personal liberation?  Or is he a selfish, little narcissist who does what he wants, no matter what the consequences.  Without going on at length about the storyline (which doubtless every reader of this review already knows), is he really that good a friend to Cameron, dragging, as he does, his genuinely ailing best friend out of his (Cameron's) sickbed.  Is it really such a good thing for Cameron to accept the entire blame for the destruction of his father's sports car?  Yes, Cam wil finally get to confront his indifferent, materialistic father, but is that \\"liberation,\\" or suicide?  And how fortunate for Ferris that after a few mild protestations, he gets to blithely skip off.  Why not a least be there for his friend when the latter has to face some very dissonant music? <br /> <br />I know, I know.  It's only a movie--an absurd comedy at that.  A live action cartoon, wherein the clever mice are all-American teenagers and the buffoonish cats are just about every adult they encounter.  On that level, it works well enough.  And teen audiences should certainly relish seeing the adult figures getting their comedownance.  It's surreal in an overtly adolescent sense of the word.  It's a world where parents are dumb, high school principals are obsessive villains (believe me, in real life, most of them are more indifferent than vindictive).   <br /> <br />But I feel almost compelled to get back to the Cameron/Ferris dynamic.  That's the plot element that really interests me.  Cameron is one of those doofus kids, who somewhat reluctantly always ends up doing what his more assertive, manipulative \\"best friend\\" wants him to do, and winds up confusing the trouble he gets into for a kind personal liberation.  There's one born every other minute.  Usually right after of the birth of a scheming brat who, in a few short years, will become the poor sap's \\"best friend.\\"
B0001LJC2K|5.0|That seems to be a common sentiment in these reviews and among many people I have talked to. I haven't really heard much Radiohead, because I'm not as musically literate as other people. But from the first time I heard this album, riding in my friend's car, I knew I wanted it. It also increased my desire to buy a bass guitar, because I wanted to learn to play \\"Time is Running Out.\\" But that's beside the point. I just don't get why people get so upset at this album for \\"sounding so much like Radiohead\\"--a point which I can neither argue for or against. They sound great. The songs blend together extremely well and I can listen to this album at any time of the day. The songs all sound, well, cool. If this is what Radiohead sounds like, then they must be good too. Why criticize Muse for \\"copying\\" a band--which I doubt was their intention; it's not like they said \\"Hey lets make songs and play just like Radiohead because we're unoriginal\\"--when they sound great anyway? I love this CD.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This is the one that really brought some well deserved popularity to this band. Whitesnake was nothing new to the rock-&-roll world but they'd gone largely unnoticed until 1987 when they released this self titled album. Every song was a masterpiece and the album shot the band into the spotlight. David Coverdale's tobacco stained vocals were at their best and his band was right on the money. The album was supported by three very flashy videos but it was the music which really counted. This album brought in loads of fans who went in search of the band's earlier albums. They weren't disappointed.<br /><br />Each of Whitesnake's albums is unique. David Coverdale has been and always will be the lead singer. It's his band. But the band lineup changes with each new record. This tends to keep the band fresh and gives the band a different sound each time they enter the studio. Along with an incredible voice, one of Coverdale's strong points is his ability to surround himself with the best musicians in the world of rock-&-roll. Consequently, each album is a new and wonderful rock experience.<br /><br />No fan of rock should be without the 1987 Whitesnake album. It's great music. And it will lead to even more great music. Buy this one if you don't already have it. You won't regret the purchase.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|Ok, Godsmack is a good band but, they have plainly released an exact replica of their other two albums!!! They are also \\"Alice in Chains\\" wanna bes and keep changing their music to sound just like them!!! Really, Godsmack is barely passes as a metal band to begin with,..... well really compare Godsmack to Pantera, Metallica, Fear Factory, Lamb of God, Megadeth, Shadows Fall, Coal Chamber, Aetryu, In Flames, KoRn, Killswitch Engage, God Forbid, Unearth, and Ozzy!!!      You may also want to check out Alice in Chains, which sounds just like these guys, but only about 1000 times better!!! True, some people see this as a rip off from \\"Alice in Chains\\", others see it as generic metal, and some people like this band!!! I'm not saying he band is bad at all and their are quite a few songs they have released that I have came to like, but releasing the almost the same album, 3 albums in a row....!!!     The only thing that saves this album would be \\"I Stand Alone\\", there are some other good songs too but, the rest is the same as \\"Awake\\" and \\"Godsmack\\" just mix and matched with some corny songs!!! What can I say it is a so and so album, I would have probably gave a 3 to, but when you how metal is progressing and involving, you see how bland and repetive this album is!!!      I will go out and say I enjoyed it some what, but it gets old fast and their is nothing to savor here!!!    I will give this a 2/5!!!
B0009VRHLK|4.0|I used to work as a security guard in an art museum. I always enjoyed the days when I was assigned the modern and contemporary art galleries, not only because of my love for the art, but because I took great pleasure in overhearing the comments and conversations of patrons passing through.  <br /> <br />What I gleaned from my time at the museum is that the average person doesn't like modern art because he doesn't know what to make of it. When one looks at a Mark Rothko or Ad Reinhart painting, it's meaning or intention is not immediately apparent. The viewer must actively search his feelings to understand what the art means to him, how it makes him feel, and only then can then he begin to understand the motivations the artist had to create the work in the first place. <br /> <br />And so it is with Vincent Gallo's latest film, \\"The Brown Bunny.\\" For those looking for a film to give them everything, you'll be most disappointed. You may even be angered. But like last year's sublime, understated and underrated \\"Elephant,\\" \\"The Brown Bunny\\" rewards those viewers who are willing to invest themselves emotionally, to see themselves through Bud's eyes, to make his pain and loneliness and sorrow their own. <br /> <br />Rather than having much in common with other fictional films, \\"The Brown Bunny\\" easily recalls the band documentaries \\"Instrument\\" (about Washington D.C. indie stalwarts Fugazi) and \\"Meeting People Is Easy\\" (about Radiohead's recording of \\"OK Computer\\" and subsequent tour). Both documentaries share the bleaker side of being a band on the road, with lengthy passages of film shot from inside tour bus and van looking at passing scenery from one nameless highway after another. <br /> <br />I will admit I was expecting another \\"Buffalo '66\\" when I walked into the theatre. And for the first twenty minutes I was unsettled and bored as I struggled to check my preconceived notions of what I thought I'd be getting with what I was actually watching. Once I let my preconceptions go, I easily settled into the film's warmly unsettling and emotionally frail fabric. Leaving the theatre, I felt that the cross-country journey, and the pain and saddness suffered along the way, had been my own.  <br /> <br />\\"The Brown Bunny\\" is the filmic equivalent of whatever album you love listening to with the headphones on, lying in the dark, wallowing in loathing and self-pity. Put yourself in that special place, and you'll find \\"The Brown Bunny\\" to be beautiful and tragic, refreshingly honest, and, above all, emotionally cathartic.
B00076ZZ84|5.0|Yes, I already had the CD. but this is worth it for the video extras alone. \\"Nobody's Home\\" is fantastic, with the young-Angelina Jolie(Foxfire) look-alike. my only complaint is that it should have been longer. <br /> If you are already an Avril fan, or if you are looking for an introduction to this wonderful, talented young woman's music, Get this disc! <br /> <br />
0679720200|1.0|This book is awful. Truly terrible and distructive. It took me years to figure out why and how to explain it and after a nightmare I had last night, I somehow thought of this book and now i know how to put it into words.  <br /> <br />Basically, if you liked this book, then I feel bad for you and the rest of society. If you didn't like it, then this is why. In order to like the book, you had to empathize with the main character and think, poor guy, not his fault. That was basically the only way to like it. Disliking it meant you were thinking, what the freak, what the freak is wrong with you. Somethings wrong and i cant explain it. <br /> <br />What this main character is, is a psychopath. Not the slang term but the medical, murderer term that we use for people like Bundy and Dahmer.  Think about it. He doesnt care about anything. He doesnt feel for anything other than a sort of detachment, and when he sort of just kills that guy for no reason, he doesnt even feel bad afterwards.  And the only time he shows any emotion is when he's about to be punished and put to death for it.  <br /> <br />Good. Thats what you do with psychopaths. You punish them and keep them from hurting little kids.  If his type of thinking is okay, \\"as long as I explain why i killed him and it was me not paying attention (apparently the sun was in his eyes as well and he couldnt find a way to word it), then I shouldnt have to die cause now i'm scared.\\"  Why dont we let everyone in teh whole world accept that as a valid excuse. We'll let every single person on earth go around shooting people for no reason <br />and say, well, as long as he wasnt paying attention.  No. We call those type of people unstable and crazy. <br /> <br />Now, if the writer had made clear somehow from the very beginning, \\"I present to you my friends,  the innerworkings, of the mind, of a madman\\" then i would say, amazing. Great. Good book. I was terrified. You win.  Instead, the writer spends the entire time trying to say, no, uh, hmm, he's, like, the average joe but he just thinks... kinda... like wierd and stuff... and so i really want to like... justify when he does something... kinda crazy and stuff.... you know? and make people... think its okay to do that kind of thing.... for no reason... cause it'll cool... just watch.   <br /> <br />Like I said, this book is terrible. And it scared people that kind of said, uh oh. There've been times when the sun was in my eyes, and yeah, that really irritated me. Sure I didn't kill anyone but... oh shoot, I'm scared now and I dont know why. And people that thought, huh, sometimes... I guess I feel detached.  I mean, I still have emotion and care about people and fall in love and feel all those other human emotions people feel but I mean... is this... something I should have looked into? cause what if I'm as crazy as this dude here.  <br /> <br />Someone that doesnt care about anything. Kills for no reason. Doesnt love or feel and thinks only of simple things and of himself. and only feels fear just as they're about to put him to death, and yet doesnt even regret that he had just ended another's life just as easily and just for the sake of it.  A psychopath.  So please dont feel bad for him. And as I said, the only way to like this book, is to do just that, because that's what the whole things about. Let's feel bad for the crazy guy cause he just didn't know any better.

0385338082|5.0|I've read all the \\"shopaholic\\" books written by Sophie Kinsella, but I have to say this one was better.  She writes in a way that it feels as though you are watching a movie or television show.  All the characters are relatable and likeable.  You want the main character to find love and succeed in life, and like every great book - that happens!  I highly recommend this book to all readers.  I would love to see this book transform to the big screen one day!
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|This movie of Star Trek series is somewhat diferent of the Next Generation Movies, this one is about ethical and moral conflicts, not that much action and adventure, the effects are not that impressive as the others (TNG) movies, but the essence is the same, and the subject of a federation officer being corrupted is interesting, i still recommend it, very pleased with amazon
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie was a blessing to me. Coincidentally, Harry Dean Stanton has become my most favorite actor over the years and Richard Farnsworth, though now deceased, is a close second.<br /><br />It was a blessing to see a story about simple brotherly love and devotion that was told without the need of one word of profanity, no sex and no violence.  I have watched the movie a number of times already and plan to watch it even more.<br /><br />There are subtle lessons literally by the dozens to be learned from the story line of this movie.  Take them all to heart.
B00078XGRO|5.0|Along with ST-Nemesis, this one is very interesting, very thrilling and full of adventure, action and very good lines, is recommended for everyone, not only those familiar with ST, the best i can say its to view it, you'll like it even if space and a very promising future for humanity its not your favorite.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This dvd is a must for everyone that loves music. this piece is timeless, like every song Eagles made. they returned after many years with this unplugged show and with an orchestra that surrounds their tracks in some songs with a special classic atmosphere. just wonderful! I love especially 'I don't know why', 'the last resort' and the best track in this concert: 'the heart of the matter', written by Don Henley. the emotions of a life condensed in 4 minutes... the sound is incredible, so clean and... perfect, and the images are very nice. I think this dvd should deserve 6 stars!

B000A2RRF4|5.0|SONY, give us the Bad and Victory Tour on DVD and when your at it, give us also Captoin EO.
B000002KDG|5.0|this is a superb album with a great song list marred only but a couple of mediocre songs towards the end.    the first five songs are acoustic and the last four are electric - in the vinyl days it would have translated as the first and second side. and i'm not sure if the first side was live as it is claimed.    all the acoustic songs have the magical melody to them - 'my my hey hey' is an ode to the power and eternity of rock'n'roll. 'thrasher' is set in the back drop of midwestern usa amidst canyons, empty roads, rivers, eagles and vultures. with 'pocahontas', young shows his emphathy for the native indians slaughtered by european settlers. 'ride my llama' is a delightful jaunt and 'sail away' is lazy and infectious.    'powderfinger' is easily one of young's best compositions where not only his vocals but also his lead guitar work displays a level of emotion rarely seen. both 'delivery sedan' and 'welfare mothers' are sub-standard filler tracks on this disc. but the closing live track 'hey hey my my' is a killer - an electric version of the first track which showcases young's electric fretplay.    great great album this!
B00004WEJZ|4.0|Connery will still always be the original James Bond.  He looked good at age 53 and still has it!  I thought Bernie Casey was a good Felix Leiter.  The locations are excellent and so it the action.  I only gave it four stars because I thought that Kim Basinger was a horrible Bond girl.  It has it's issues, but a good unofficial Bond Film.
B0000009SG|5.0|I'm not the normal Frank Zappa fan. The Apostrophe/Overnite Sensation CD (two albums on one CD!) was the first FZ albumn that I listened to. It simply blew me off my feet. Memorable tunes, blazing guitar work (the livewire lead in dirty love and the highly tasty fretwork in montana), hilarious lyrics (the bawdy dinah mo hum), backing vocals done to perfection by tina turner, elements of jazz - in my opinion, as a rock album(s), it has few peers.     But as I said I'm not the normal Zappa fan. After hearing these two albums, I've thirsted to listen their like from Zappa - but always been disappointed - a few of his other albums that I bought - We're only in it for the money, Hot Rats, Shiek Yerbouti - I've not listened to them again after the initial playing. Some have told me that these actually are the quintessential Zappa albums and not Apostrophe/Overnite Sensation which are just Zappa's experimentations with Pop - maybe - but for me these two will always remain among the best albums I've heard.     ps : i'm revisiting this review after five years! found another couple of zappa gems : roxy and elsewhere and one size fits all. if you liked overnite sensation, you're likely to love the above two as well as apostrophe.
B00005JL0I|2.0|I prefer a more serious Casino Royale.  I have read the novel and it was good.  As for this film, you have to have a serious sense of humor to understand this film.  I own it on VHS, and I only watch it when I need help in falling asleep.
0316779237|5.0|This book is a riot. I was laughing so hard, I thought I'd need an oxygen mask to catch my breath. The SantaLand Diaries was by far the funniest thing I have ever read, and well worth the price of the book. The other stories weren't as hilarious as that one, but they were all funny and I'm glad I read them. This book is a great pick-me-up anytime of the year!
1586217615|4.0|much of this book is about psychological and scientific studies i found very compelling.  The focus is on whether first impressions, educated guesses, quick intuitive thinking, etc. are accurate, and how they can be used to enhance our lives via medical/scientific research.  Examples and stories are used frequently to illustrate the value of this knowledge in human services, business, and many other areas.  The Author uses some technical jargon but i did not have difficulty following him;  however, i am in the medical field and am also very interested in medical, social, and psychological research.

B00005JNTX|3.0|First, let me say that Sin City is the type of movie I normally love to watch---a gritty crime drama that doesn't shy away from realistic language, violence and adult situations in order to create a dark, moody atmosphere.  Second, let me add that I like everyone involved with this film.  I think most of the actors are great, I like just about everything Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino have ever done, and I admire Frank Miller's writing. <br />The bad news, then?  This movie just wasn't very good. <br /> <br />The main draw of the film is that it's made to look like a comic book come to life, and in that sense it's a success; the visuals are darkly stunning, and the whole film is, overall, \\"cool\\" to watch, for want of a better word.  Unfortunately, though, this film is mainly nothing but cliches and tired old story lines about crooked cops, hookers with a heart of gold and rugged detectives that we've seen a million times.  The dialogue is laughably bad and the actors seem stiff and wooden delivering it; you almost feel like you're watching your local middle school putting on a dramatic adaptation of some 1940s black-and-white gangster movie. <br /> <br />The movie also goes way, way, way over the top with the violence.  I can watch just about anything and not be bothered, but this film was basically a two-hour barrage of heads being chopped off, men being shot (or stabbed) in the crotch, and other men being turned into swiss cheese by bullets.  When you can't go more than five minutes without showing a bloody killing, you know you've run out of ideas as a filmmaker. <br /> <br />Overall, this is the type of movie that 12-year-old boys would see and go \\"Wow!  Neat!\\", but they're the last people in the world who should watch a film like this.  My advice to everyone else is to watch it once, admire the movie's innovative style, overlook all of its flaws, then forget about it.

0385486804|3.0|Into the Wild is a book about a man who wandered into the wilderness of Alaska. I don't want to give away the ending because they already told it at the beginning of the book.

B00000I49J|3.0|In their first album \\"Psychocandy,\\" brothers Jim and William Reid, the force behind JMC, experimented with sonics -- a buzzing chainsaw like sound, which was imitated by a myriad of latter-day bands (eg. My Bloody Valentine, Ride, The Raveonettes).  The band basically cleaned up their sound with \\"Darklands,\\" which is more-or-less a straight-forward melodic rock album, which contains what is perhaps JMC's signature song: \\"Happy When It Rains.\\"  In fact, one can hear the band basically repeat the melody of this particular song a number of times on subsequent albums. <br /> <br />The second best song on Darklands is probably \\"Down On Me,\\" which is the only rocking number on the album.  I love the guitar work on this track.  The other standouts (though not really at the same level as \\"Happy When It Rains\\" and \\"Down On Me\\") are \\"Darklands\\" (the title track), \\"April Skies,\\" \\"Cherry Came Too\\" (with a humorous tribute to the Beach Boys in the middle) and \\"About You.\\"   <br /> <br />JMC often uses double entendres, usually involving a sexual theme.  Just look at two of the song titles: \\"Down On Me\\" and \\"Cherry Came Too\\" which have nothing to do with what you might think.   <br /> <br />A number of the songs on \\"Darklands\\" speak of the pleasure and pain of being with the one you love.  For instance, from \\"Happy When It Rains\\": \\"But Something about you felt like pain/ You were my sunny day rain/ You were the clouds in the sky/ You were the darkest sky/ But your lips spoke gold and honey/ That't why I'm happy when it rains.\\"  From \\"April Skies\\": \\"Hand in hand in a violent life/ Making love on the edge of a knife.\\"  From \\"Cherry Came Too\\": \\"Cherry takes me to the place above/ With barbed wire kisses and her love.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Darklands\\" clocks in as a good, not great album, that would be clearly surpassed by \\"Honey's Dead,\\" two albums down the road.

B00005JKTF|5.0|A little somber and not nearly enough wild and crazy \\"shoot `em up, bang, bang\\" scenes for many contemporary movie-goers, but superbly acted, wonderfully choreographed -- and the movie soon immersed me in a tale of love's lost and won, bravery and a desperate struggle against the occupying Nazis during the French resistance... <br /> <br />One wonders whether such heroism exists today among the common folk, but the tale is all the more compelling as the character, Charlotte, is based on the real-life valor of the special operations agents working deep behind enemy lines and far out of reach of any help.  It was a deadly game... one either lived or died and there wasn't much in between - the odds of returning from these missions were not good.  But desperate times compelled desperate acts and the picture \\"Charlotte Gray\\" tells the tale in a compelling, human way that soon drags the viewer right in there with her. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorites.  I've watched the movie several times - but only when I have enough time to watch it straight through.  This is one flick where interruptions are not appreciated. <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|since ok computer in 1997 radiohead has had a lot to deal with. anyone who watched the meeting people is easy dvd knows quite what im getting at when i say this was a hectic time for the band. its hard to beleive its coming up on 5 years since this album came out wow... but as any fan of modern music would know...this one should not be missed. radiohead fans the die hard ones, have become enamoured with thsi recording, calling it the greatest of all time. im not sre about any of that, its sonically a deviation from the ordinary and a true marvel that this group pulled off what they did. from the opening track which grew on me to the mind blowing title track which lulls you with its serene complacency in idm world this shows a whole new radiohead. national anthem is a classic piece of experimental punk that leads the listener to great heights as they excite themselves in the horns and fuzzy and yet catchy as hell bassline that thom yorke made. how to disappear has string exploits similar to climbing up the walls from OK Computer, but it excels that one it is mere grandiosity and make cutw look less like the frightening song it is and more of a child tune in comparison. treefingers is quite possibly the most alluring piece of music i've heard in a while, no those arent synthesizers, those are guitars being fed into a sampler played by ed and maniplulated by thom. you can tell because of the insane fluctuations in frequency. optimistic is a gorgeous ballad with tribal sounding drums and organic lush gutiars and thom yourkes vocals making you sway in excitement. its a gorgeous song overall very underrated suprisingly to say. in limbo is one track 90% of people i ask about kid a hate, i dont know why its genius and an amazing composition of colins bassline leading the way through drifting guitars. idioteque is a glorious example of cliched but catchy and groovy idm, using a sample of a paul lansky tune mild und leise from 1977. morning bell is a pretty little scarysong with its dark melodies and organ soundings making things go into a darker realm. the ending track is motion picture soundtrk and its a great song to listen to when youre about to lose your mind. harp melodies and thoms deadpan vocals are all in tow as you exit the experience kid a . thanks for coming, return soon.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|\\"The Machinist\\" is not an easy film to watch, as one sees Trevor Resnik (Christian Bale) descend into hell, plagued by visions we don't know the source of, until the pieces fit together in the final section of the film. There are \\"signposts\\" along the way...an intersection with a water tower, a coffee shop at the airport, a red car...and many roads that end in right/left choices. He keeps turning left (sinistro) as he goes down the rabbit hole of madness. Rather like Dostoyevsky's Roskolnikov in \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" we are watching his mental state affect his physical world, as the phantoms of his conscience become real.<br /><br />Another reason this film is not easy viewing is looking at Christian Bale, who lost 63 Lbs. for the part of Trevor. He is skeletal, and no other actor has gone to such lengths to change his physical appearance for a film. His performance is excellent, and his reptilian look adds to the mystery of the plot, which includes his claim that he has not slept in a year. Famous in her native land, Spanish actress Aitana Sanchez-Gij&oacute;n is wonderful as Marie the waitress, and Jennifer Jason Leigh is superb as Stevie, a \\"heart of gold\\" prostitute who befriends Trevor. In smaller parts there is Michael Ironside as Miller, who works in the machine shop, and John Sharian as the bizarre Ivan.<br /><br />The cinematography by Xavi Gim&eacute;nez, mostly in steely shades of blue and gray, is extremely effective. Shot in Barcelona (for financial reasons, because no US studio would put up money for the film), the story by first-time scriptwriter Scott Kosar is supposed to take place in a West Coast city. By keeping most of the action in an old machine shop and a warehouse, the film's locations have the look of any dilapidated part of town, anywhere in the world.<br /><br />Directed by Brad Anderson, this strange but sometimes oddly beautiful film is not going to appeal to everyone, but is sure to become a cult favorite. It needs more than one viewing, so that one can see it after having put the puzzle together, and appreciate it for its cinematic skill, which is almost deserving of a 5 star rating. The score by Roque Ba&ntilde;os has the necessary eerie quality, and total running time is 102 minutes. DVD extras include audio commentary by director Anderson, \\"The Machinist: Breaking the Rules,\\" 8 deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.

0070511136|1.0|Isn't it interesting how only the people who can't or don't sell give  garbage like this 5 star raving reviews? Obviously they have never sold anything. <br /> <br />I used to work for a company a few months ago that was raving about this program. Spin Selling was the best and only way to sell they said. This company is a travel company, host and travel agency and had their amateur telemarketers use Spin Selling.  <br /> <br />Whne I was there the companies sales were down 20% from 2004 and they had a 60% cancellation rate! Does that say anything about the value of Spin Selling? <br /> <br />The top sales people there were basically order takers getting laydowns. They had no clue how to conduct a professional sales presentation. From newest rep right through the supervisors up to and including the sales manager. <br /> <br />You could have attached a order pad to a dog and sent them to the homes of the people who had placed orders with these order takers and the dog could have closed them! The top sales reps here were \\"King of the 1-call laydowns.\\" It was comical watching them try to utilize something close to a professional sales presentation. <br /> <br />I know some sales people who use spin as  part of the sales process. I have tried it. By itself, Spin Selling DOES NOT WORK.  <br /> <br />This book is a waste of time and money. Better off to read something with some meat like Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy or Tom Hopkins. If you use Spin at all, use it with a real sales system, not alone. <br /> <br />This book is like chewing gum for your sales brain and will gum up your sales career.  <br /> <br />I will be  glad to go one on one against anyone who uses the Spin Selling Method in any real and equal sales encounter. What? No challengers! Well I wonder why???
B0001KZM3O|4.0|MY GOD, THAT'S ANNOYING! There's a review a few entries down, by a long-time Floyd fan, with a less-than-favorable review, some good points, but, my God, CAN'T YOU SEE IT WRITTEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU? And this goes for the people who insist on adding an \\"L\\" to Waters' name, making it \\"Walters.\\" GET A CLUE, THEN WRITE YOUR REVIEW! It's \\"Waters.\\" And \\"Gilmour.\\" This is  not difficult. Every Pink Floyd entry has people doing this, it kills the credidibity of your review. OK, enough venting.<br /><br />Now, the record. \\"The Final Cut\\" is essentially a Roger Waters  solo work, with David Gilmour and Nick Mason as members of the backing band. It seems to have the Pink Floyd name on it, as a selling point. Waters went head-long into this period of intense creative activity in 1976, and it lasted on into 1984, with no less than four VERY wordy albums, \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall,\\" \\"The Final Cut,\\" and \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchiking,\\" as well as a whole side of material for the film soundtrack \\"When The Wind Blows.\\" Just in lyric content alone, these four (and a half) LP's, have more material in them than most people put out in their whole career. And to get it into perspective, listen to Bob Geldof's babbling in the toilet on \\"The Wall (film version),\\" where he sings \\"Stop.\\" Before singing the lyrics to \\"Stop,\\" he is singing \\"The Moment Of Clarity,\\" from \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchiking,\\" so, obviously, \\"Pros And Cons...\\" was written a full two years or more before \\"The Wall\\" movie ever came out, even though it was released two years after. There is a lot of over-lapping material in these works, and if you can take Waters' style of singing, it would be a humbling experience to hear all of them together, albeit, a little heavy-handed.<br /><br />As for \\"The Final Cut\\" itself,the reviews fall into two catagories, those who really like it, and those who really dislike it; I am in the first group. The other members of Pink Floyd (Gilmour and Mason, with Wright out of the band at this point), would be in the latter.

B00005JNTX|3.0|What I hate nowadays is that DVDs are beginning to lack all the goodies. Rather, the filmmakers/motion picture studios decide to release bare-bones DVDs, then some months later, re-release the same movie, but with all the goodies. Why the hell must they continue such an absurd strategy? Hey, I love Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's movies, but this travesty must stop. <br /> <br />I loved \\"Sin City,\\" but why must fans have to wait LONGER for the DVD edition containing what we all desired in the first place?
B004SIPA4G|5.0|A collection 6 stories that interweaving the whole film set in the fictional city of Basin City aka Sin City as we start off with part 1 of \\"The Customer is Always Right\\" where a Salesman (Joss Harnett) invites a sexy customer (Marley Shelton) to his place to die. \\"That Yellow Bastard part 1\\" tells us how hard-boiled officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) swore to protect a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a child-killer/rapist named Roak Junior (Nick Stahl) but fails then next we have \\"The Hard Good-Bye\\" where a big-chinned powerhouse named Marv (Mickey Rouke) was having an affair with a sexy girl named Goldie (Jaime King) until he wakes up to find her dead. He has been set-up as he runs from the law as he interrogates some people including a priest (Frank Miller) for finds out a crazed swifted clawed maniac named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who has a taste to literally eat prostitutes and finds out the rotten cardinal (Rutger Hauer) is all behind this for justice must be served. Following after that \\"The Big Fat Kill\\" has Dwight (Clive Owen) taking care of an abusive man named Jackie-Boy (Benico Del Toro) but while he finds the sleaziest part of town run by protective prostitues lead by tough but sexy leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wage a war with some mercenaries like Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Then we have \\"That Yellow Bastard part 2\\" has Hartigan sentenced 9 years to prison then after that he is released to find the young girl Nancy (Jessica Alba) all grown up at 19, unfortunately a deformed yellow man named Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahls) kidnaps her as he must save the girl then finally we end with part 2 of \\"The Customer is Always Right\\" where i won't reveal to you the ending.<br /><br />A brilliant, cold-blooded and hard boiled adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel series from Dark Horse Comics. Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects. I like how it accurately depicts 4 graphic novels in one movie page-by-page scene-by-scene shot in glorious black-and-white with some color tints in some areas for select objects. The violence is gory and graphic but mainly white colored at times to make it look like out of the comics which is a very nifty and creative idea i should say. The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film. Co-starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect. I saw this movie 4 times in theaters as i knew they would not screw up this adaptation and satisfies action fans including fans of comics/graphic novels.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has absolutely flawless picture and sound quality like if it was like going to the theaters. Disc one has Cine-Explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well. Disc 2 has the unrated recut extended edition which is longer and violent with cool extras like \\"Kill em good\\" which is an interactive comic plus Rodgriguez extras like 16 minute film school, all green screen version, the long take, Sin City: Live in Concert and 10 minute cooking school. Additional extras are featurette on how they put the graphic novels on film, interview with Quentin Taranitno, 3 featurettes and trailers and teasers.<br /><br />A must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films.e with stunning visual effects.

0425182177|5.0|I don't view this book with an ideological mind, as other reviewer pointed.<br /><br />The important point is that you will have much fun with the descriptions of what can happen to the guys in the money world.<br /><br />What I can guarantee you is that you'll finish reading this book in 1, 2 or 3 days !<br /><br />Very amusing. Enjoy it.
0060763280|5.0|Unbelieveable, outstanding, a must for all those whom want more for themselves and their family
B00003CXA6|5.0|I thought this presentation was very well done. We seldom are <br />able to see and feel the passion and sacrifice of the southern <br />states during the Civil War. I feel \\"Gettyburg\\" has brought home <br />the emotion that helped fuel this conflict and strongly <br />recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in the forces <br />that shaped our country.
B00005JNTX|2.0|I am a big fan of Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book series, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, pretty much all of the actors in the film, and the film itself.  I loved this movie, it was like a dream come true for me, being such a huge fan of the comic and the author to see him come together with my favorite director, Robert Rodriguez.  The film turned out great, was totally faithful to the point that it LOOKS like the comic book.  Its just a great movie, i'll leave it at that. <br /> <br />That much said, the DVD is weak.  There is one special feature, and there is nothing special about it.  Its like a 10 minute (if that) junket that pretty much only serves to advertise the movie.  Weak sauce.  There are three incredibly cool and creative people involved with making this movie, plus this movie is shot and put together in such a cool way, its a disservice NOT to have special features about the making of this movie.  Besides that they could also have features about the comic book, etc... <br /> <br />Even if they didnt do that much... aside from \\"The Faculty\\" what Robert Rodriguez DVD has not come with \\"Ten Minute Film School\\" and a commentary track?!?!? None that I can think of....  So i was pretty let down. <br /> <br />Anway, you have to get the DVD if you want to watch the cool movie at home, but i would hope that there is a better version on its way.
B00005B6C9|3.0|\\"TIWICI\\" was the last Bee Gees' album which shows the brother Gibbs' weaknesses since their superior \\"Still Waters\\" in 1997.This album sounds so much like \\"Barry Gibb and the band\\", \\"Robin Gibb and the band\\"  and \\"Maurice Gibb and the band\\", not the Bee Gees in the whole since the brothers chose to record separately. And this is the only album since \\"Mr. Natural\\" 1974 that lacks Barry's trademark falsetto.  <br /> 1/ This Is Where I Came In: One of my most favorite Gibb's song ever. Maurice's rhythm guitar is excellent. Quite a strange song for a usual Bee Gees' ear but yet perfect (5/5). <br /> 2/ She Keeps On Coming: Another of my favorite from this album. Back to the 60's rock root with some modern touch. Robin sounds so much unlike himself. At first, I thought it was Maurice on vocal. Love the arrangement and the erotic lyrics. (4.5/5) <br /> 3/ Sacred Truth: Written for the Backstreet Boys and that's why it don't sound as good as a true Bee Gees song even though Barry Gibb's vocal is brilliant. The verses are quite good, however the  chorus is too \\"boy-band-ish\\" to be a good Bee Gees song. (3.5/5) <br />4/ Wedding Day: Too catchy to be regarded as a hit, but I'll have it on my wedding since I'm a big fan of the Bee Gees. (3/5) <br />5/ Man in the Middle: Nice job, Mo. Love the lyrics. My girlfriend loves it even though she's not a Bee Gees fan. (4/5) <br />6/ Deja Vu: Quite a catchy song even though I'm not quite sure what the lyrics about. Seems to be another boy band-ish song. The Bee Gees sure can do better than this.(3/5) <br />7/ Technicolor Dreams: My favorite. A fun song even out of style. I think Barry loves the 40's music. But not sure why he whispered  \\" Kiss my ass\\" before the song. (5/5) <br />8/ Walking on Air: Another Mo's effort, sound so much like \\"Omega Man\\", nothing special except for the Beach Boys blending harmony.(3.5/5) <br />9/ Loose Talk Cost Live: Many people like this song, I don't even though it's a good ballad. Barry's  voice soundsa bit creepy here.(3/5) <br />10/ Embrace:I really dislike this song. The Euro-dance pop pattern freaks me out. Why Robin? It was so out of date and cheap. Try something better. (2/5) <br /> 11/ An Extra Mile: Rumors had it the brothers wrote this song for Olympic Sydney 1998 which sounds so much unlike an Olympic song. Not one of my favorite anyway. But still a good song. (3/5) <br /> 12/ Voice of the Wilderness: Lyrically too long to be a rock song. Need more guitar solos and shorter verse. (3/5) <br /> For a die-hard Bee Gees' fan, this album is a must. But for those who don't like boy band music, go for \\"Still Waters\\" or \\"One\\" instead to appreciate the magic of the Gibb's music.
1592400876|2.0|I really wanted to like this book!  In fact, I was even tempted to pay full retail based on the subject and reviews.  I didn't like it, nor did I pay full retail.  I found it confusing and tiresome. I love to read \\"Elements of Style\\" (Wm. Strunk)and \\"Chicago Manual of Style\\" and similar books just for fun.  \\"Elements of Style\\" may have been what I was hoping for, hence the disappointment.  The mix of yes-no-do-don't was confusing, and as a language/word lover, I learned nothing new or useful. <br /> <br />I don't see what the fuss is about.
B000646MNE|5.0|Sex and the City is one of the greatest series ever aired on Cable TV.  Women adore it since it relates to very realistic topics in their lives and men should study it so that they can better understand women on another level other than their neanderthal ape-like instincts.  Otherwise it is a great show for men to get in touch with their feminine side!  Sarah Jessica Parker is AMAZING!!!!!
B00005Q4GA|4.0|I love a movie that has a lot of action. I tried playing a demo of one of the \\"Lara Croft\\" video games a couple of years ago, and I wasn't very good at it, so I figured it'd be a lot more cooler to watch instead of playing. WAS I RIGHT. It has adventure with action and fantasy. I guess you  either love or you hate video game adaptions. Everybody on this website hated \\"Super Mario Brothers\\" and I liked it, and \\"The Cat In The Hat.\\" I don't know why. That had the same humor as the Grinch. But that's not a video game originally. It's just something that I liked and everyone else, for no reason that I can think of, hated.     Heeeeerrreee'ss the plot:    The Illuminati is some kind of \\"group\\" that Lara Croft {Angelina Jolie} has to stop. In order to do that, she needs to find pieces to the Triangle of Light, which goes back to her father's {Jon Voight, her real-life father} past. He had been missing for quite some time and hadn't been found. She has to go and find them on a dangerous quest. I'm not sure what else to say about the plot. I just found this movie to be pretty entertaining. Lara goes on a big adventure that is worth seeing for the special effects and the action!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Haunting and brilliant parable about the ramifications of buried guilt--something hardly tapped into with cinema.  The kaleidoscopic psychological landscapes of a bewildered, sanity-grappling individual are sublime and somewhat reminiscent of Patrick McGrath's _Spider_.  Christian Bale is astounding and even more charismatic in his painfully gaunt state, and the film's plot nuances and cinematography linger in the memory long after it's finished.  (The blanched shots of Bale's emaciated spinal column and taut-veined neck are artworks in themselves).  If any flaws, they cannot overshadow this film's delicate, subtle brilliance.
0151003084|5.0|Even though Tim Burton did not write this book, it's almost like he did because it's in the same category as \\"The Melancholy Death Of Oyster Boy and other stories.\\" Why? Morbid humor. It's that simple. A macabre A-Z book by Edward Gorey is close enough if you ask me. With Edward Gorey's imagination, he seems to have the same kind of dark taste. If you have an interest in morbid things, you should read this. You might like it, not to mention the fact that everybody loves this book, as I do. It's in Tim Burton's dark style, and perfectly fits what it is in the rhyming and the illustrations. \\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" is a pretty quirky title to call this book. I wish there were more books like this and \\"Oyster Boy.\\" I guess this is what Edward Gorey just wanted to call it, and coincidentially, it's seems right.
014118213X|4.0|Howards End is set in the tradition of the great British novel. Although Forster tackles less politically and morally charged themes here than he does with A Passage to India, Howards End certainly has more heart--naturally, since it tackles the soul. <br /> <br />There is also a secondary theme of the approaching women's lib movement, always in the background, but always threatening the men in the novel, especially Henry Wilcox and his brood. Margaret Schlegel is the sort of woman who would be at the forefront on the movement today, but she doesn't know it. Her intelligence and passion for people and creation are inhibited by an early resignation to Old Maidhood--that is, until she falls in love with Mr. Wilcox, the husband of Margaret's late, unlikely mate. <br /> <br />Practical and dispassionate, Wilcox is \\"the sort of man who made Britain\\" what it is (one of Forster's pet phrases), yet an emotionally insipid and incompetent patriarch. He is exactly the sort of man women are fighting even today--he doesn't understand women; he doesn't even understand men, except in business. <br /> <br />Stalking these very different sides of the British upper middle-class throughout the story is Leonard Bast, a poor clerk with a spark of the greatness the Schlegels value, who hides his authentic humanity behind affectations of culture. Helen's, Margaret's sister's, attempts at patronage are a rather overt stab at wealthy liberal condescension toward the underclass, applicable to limousine libs today. <br /> <br />Receding into the past but never forgotten, is the will from Mrs. Wilcox bequeathing Howards End to Margaret--a mystical and unfulfilled last will and testament that haunts  the Wilcoxes for failure to comply with the lady's wishestill the end.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|\\"North & South\\" was released in the UK in November 2004 and in the US in July 2005. Since its first broadcast, viewers across the globe have hailed it as one of the best - if not the best - British period miniseries ever produced. It was voted BBC's \\"Best of 2004\\" in drama, actor and actress categories, among others. <br /> <br />Many in the US will probably confuse Elizabeth Gaskell's \\"North & South\\" to John Jake's civil war drama of the same name.  While Jake's tells the story of America's north and south, Gaskell's story is rooted in Victorian England. John Thornton, a handsome, stern, passionate manufacturer from Milton represents the north. Margaret Hale, an outspoken, beautiful and spirited young woman from Helstone represents the south.  When the Hales move from the idyllic village of Helstone to the bustling, industrial city of Milton, Margaret and Thornton's lives collide. <br /> <br />John Thornton is instantly attracted to Margaret while she is repulsed by his haughty demeanor and the way he treats his employees.  She develops a disdain for the wealthy 'masters' (manufacturers) and strikes a friendship with the daughter of the local union leader, much to Thornton's dismay.  As Margaret becomes better acquainted with Mr. Thornton, she gradually comes to admire him.  She discovers that he is hardworking, a devoted brother and son, generous and kind to Margaret's parents, and is loyal and honorable.  However, when the workers in Milton strike, the turn of events that follow drive a wedge between Margaret and Thornton and eventually threaten to pull them apart.   <br /> <br />\\"North & South\\" is produced by the excellent BBC and the screenplay was written by Sandy Welch, who also penned the outstanding \\"Our Mutual Friend.\\"  Everything you would expect from a topnotch BBC production is here - locations, sets, costumes, casting, direction, cinematography.  The story is an adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's little known but well loved 19th century novel.  Mrs. Gaskell also wrote \\"Wives & Daughters\\" which was turned to another superb miniseries starring Justine Waddell, Keeley Hawes and Francesca Annis in 1999. <br /> <br />I would be very remiss in writing a review for this miniseries without applauding the exemplary cast.  The little known Richard Armitage has earned a throng of fans overnight because of his unforgettable portrayal of John Thornton.  He has since replaced Pride & Prejudice's Colin Firth as my favorite brooding hero and infuses so much passion and charisma into his role.  Daniela Denby-Ashe is wonderful and charming as Margaret Hale.  Also excellent are Brendan Coyle as the gruff but good-hearted Nicholas Higgins, Sinead Cusack as John Thornton's haughty but devoted mother, Joy Joyner as the funny and superficial Fanny Thornton, Lesley Manville as Mrs. Hale and Tim Piggot-Smith as Mr. Hale. <br /> <br />\\"North & South\\" has since replaced 1995's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" as my favorite miniseries.  It tugs at the heart and sweeps the viewer off their feet.  The relationships that develop between its main characters (notably, Thornton and Margaret; Thornton and Higgins; Margaret and Bessy Higgins) and the journey that Margaret and Thornton go through are truly unforgettable.  In fact, you will wish that the ending didn't come so soon! <br /> <br />\\"North and South\\" went through a sad process of editing when BBC America aired it in July 2005. A full hour was cut from the miniseries to make room for commercials.  Finally, with this dvd release US viewers now have a chance to see this instant classic as it was meant to be seen - with a 233 minute running time and with all the scenes intact.  The dvd also includes a delightful interview with Richard Armitage, a handful of deleted scenes (including an extended 'proposal' scene), commentaries and cast biographies. <br /> <br />If you are an anglophile or a fan of high-quality period drama, you owe it to yourself to see \\"North & South.\\" Fans of \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" \\"Wives& Daughters,\\" \\"Middlemarch,\\" Dickens / Austen adaptations and the like should not miss this.  I have no doubt that most of you will fall in love with this miniseries as many of us have. Everyone whom I have recommended this miniseries to have at least liked it (and at most, are completely obsessed with it).  This dvd is a keeper and deserves a place in any period drama fan's dvd collection. <br /> <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Mr. Cash is one of the greatest musicians of country music history. I'm not an American, and I just discover his music a little time ago, but I think that his music is universal. <br />It is a pleasure for me to sit at my living room and listen to Mr. Cash music. I really encourage all you to live that experience. <br />The music is so warm that you fell him next to you.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Completely original and made with the precision of a Swiss watch and the art of a tortured Van Goh brush. Evidently, I'm not the only one singing its praises. Cannes Film Festival gave it the Grand Prix award (2nd place) and Universal Pictures have bought the rights to the movie for a U.S. remake perhaps staring Russell Crowe.  This film is completely original, with suprises, twists and turns, but the well done visuals don't exhaust the viewer. It also does a unexpected mind job on the viewer and it's often impossible to predict what will happen next. Without spoiling anything for anyone, imagine Kill Bill without the wires and samurai sword (but leave the violence and revenge theme) throw in a dash of Hitchcock (suspense, morality and social corruption) and an ounce of Kubrick (tight, precise film making and wierdness blending with the sublime) and you have Old Boy. Buy it, rent it, just plain see it however you can and get ready for the ride of your cinema life because we ain't in Kansas anymore.....
068983571X|4.0|I chose this book because it was recommended to me as a good mystery.<br /><br />This book is about a murder case that is publicly disguised as a supernatural curse.  The curse is based on the history of the Baskerville family.  Hugo Baskerville, who was very wealthy, was mysteriously murdered by a supposed hound that killed him because he was taking advantage of a neighbors daughter.  After that incident, the hound haunted the family.  After the death of Sir Charles Baskerville in the same way, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigate to keep Sir Henry Baskerville safe, who will be moving into the family estate.  Originally, all signs lead to the Barrymores, who would have gained some inheritance after CHarles' death.<br /><br />This was one of the few books that I enjoyed.  It was the first real mystery book that I've ever read, and it was interesting to read.  It never really got boring, and it also was a believable story.  I don't like many stories where the plot has too much supernatural stuff and I just don't fall for it.  I don't regret reading it.
B0007CNXUK|3.0|I went into this movie expecting it to be very cheesy and very sappy.  To my surprise, it was neither of the two.  Unfortunately, I also thought it might be a little boring and I was right on that assumption.  I had a hard time getting into the movie until about halfway through.  Depp, Winslet, and the children were all very good in the movie.  There was a definite chemistry between the actors that came across.  The best part of the movie is at the end when Winslet goes to Neverland.  That's really, to me, the only stand out scene in the movie.  The story was a little sad without being depressing or draining.  It was funny without being over the top, and it was thoughtful without sounding like a Hallmark commercial.  It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'll be rushing out to buy it.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|If this guy doesn't get your pulse going, no one will. He bubbles with personality and has those two qualities few are born with called charisma and charm. <br />Backstage, onstage or just goofing around Michael Buble gives you 100% of himself and that says a lot. We haven't heard anyone sing songs like this in 25 years and say thank God for Michael remembering how it's done. <br />My nieces think he's something else and for once we can agree on something.
B000021YQV|5.0|To start, I would like to point out that I don't really care for a lot of hard rock with growling such as this. I applaud System of a Down (I'll call them SD from now on) for making them enjoy it. Some songs are more hardcore while there are a couple soft songs. I like this CD a lot. <br /> <br />1. The Prison Song: The only song that I've ever listened to in which I liked the growling scream thing that singers do. I like the fast paced action, the high pitched chorus, and the interesting little facts that they throw in there. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Needles: Good song, another faster paced song that is good to listen to. I like the little interlude, but it is kind of creepy. That doesn't make it lose points, just a comment. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance: I don't like the beginning as much as some of their other songs, but the rest of it is good after that. Good guitar, really interesting. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot: One of the songs I don't much care for on this CD. It doesn't seem to have much composure in the chorus, just a bunch of band members goin nuts and yelling and what-not. 6/10 <br /> <br />5. X: Definitely the worst song on the CD. Pretty repetitive. Only nice thing about it is the guitar in the beginning, and after that it gets annoying. 4/10 <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey: Excellent recovery from the last track. Chop Suey is the best song on the CD mostly because it is hard and soft at the same time. Great guitar and excellent vocals. Fun and challenging to sing along to. This is probably SD's best song ever and it is a perfect song. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Bounce: Funny and cool song about jumping on a pogo stick. Only problem with this song is that it is too short. Good song. 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Forest: Great song with interesting vocals that are enjoyable to listen to. The guitar is also impressive. The chorus and verses are both great. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. ATWA: Brilliant song that is crushed by a bad chorus. The vocals and guitar are so great untilthe chorus interrupt with bad growling. 7/10 <br /> <br />10. Science: Great song that actually has an interesting point behind the lyrics. Talks about how science can't prove that we need faith to believe things. One of the best songs on the CD. Awesome guitar, nice bass, and great chorus. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Shimmy: This song really is fun to listen to if you're driving in a car because of its fast pace. One of their songs in which the lyrics are hard to understand because they talk so fast, but that's a cool factor. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Toxicity: I love the guitar that starts this song off. At first you think it's going to be a soft song, but then BAM! breaks into a hard guitar. I especially enjoyed the vocals on this track because the lead singer really shows off his levels and it's enjoyable. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. Psycho: This song makes me laugh because it seems like the kind of song that you would listen to when you're on speed that makes you paranoid. Fun song to listen. 10/10 <br /> <br />14. Aerials: Another one of the best songs on the CD. I love the singing in this song. The Drop-D tuned guitar is also really nice. This song actually is a moral song which is surprising from a band like SD. Great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />So overall this CD gets a 123/140 which is an 88%. I gave it a tilt to make it a 90% because it is a CD that I have had for a couple years that I still listen to constantly. This is a must-buy for anybody who likes System of a Down at all.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Exceptional cd.  13 nice songs that include covers and an original that just went #1 on Billboard. Have you seen him doing Starbucks ads on TV? Thats how I was first formally introduced to this artist.  You will want to dance with the fast ones, and hug your special person with the slow ones. Good for the blood pressure either way!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Like all artists who stick with one genre throughout the prime of their career, and then transition into more experimental styles at a later time, Enigma is no exception to recieving negative attention. However, I feel that this transition fits Enigma perfectly. From the beginning, Enigma has been about Electronic Ambience, mixed with chanson and erotic beats. 'Trip-Hop,' which is the UK-coined genre that Enigma has transitioned into, compliments this quite well. <br /> <br />When I first played the album, I had expected to hear \\"the voice of enigma\\" mixed in with the first track. (For some reason, it would have seemed appropriate.) I honestly felt this to be a facelift of 'MCMXC,' though it definitely was not. (Still, that would be interesting to see.) Regardless, I thought every track on this album was fantastic. I'm still a bit confused about 'Look of Today,' however... it seems oddly out of place. <br /> <br />In case many have not noticed, the term 'voyageur' is a french word. It means something along the lines of \\"The voyage from east to west.\\" (Though, not in those exact words.) There seems to be quite a bit of French influence about this album, actually... which is a good thing. <br /> <br />If you're into experimental music, Trip-Hop, or general Electronica, then I think this album is definitely worth checking out. I would also recommend it to other Enigma fans, though I understand that most of them are more adapt to Enigma's original style, and may not enjoy this transition.
B00005HYH5|4.0|This is last PF psychedelic album, and it's pretty succesful, but also very wierd. The first disc contains live recordings, and they are good. Astronomy Domine seems more powerful than on piper, and it has an organ improvisation. Careful with THat Axe Eugene is an absolute classic of psychodelic rock. Set THe Controls are also better than the studio version, also more scary and with more improvisations. Saucerful Of Secrets is more wild and the last part is much more powerful than on studio version, but studio version is more mystery and scary.  <br />The studio part of ummagumma is a set of most wierd, twisted, psychedelic songs Pink Floyd ever did. Each member of the band wrore his own material and so here it is. First comes Richard Wright with Syphys, that starts quite interesting, but then it becomes so twisted and you just can't listen to it. Next one is Waters, with soft song Grandchester Meadows, that goes into Several Spieces..., and this is a combination of sounds of some small fury animals with some other wierd stuff. I don't really like that. But here's something better: i think Narrow Way is the best part of ummagumma studio. Part first is a soft acoustic melody, part two is a heavy, distorted riff with some other effects, and part three is a mystery, psychodelic song. I think it's worth effort and i like it. There's still something else, Mason shows us his drum creation, Grand Vizier's Garden Party, which is a song only with drum and percussion and a lot of improvisations. At first time I didn't like it, but it has its wierd, haunted climax that is cool. <br /> <br />Generally I think ummagumma is a worth effort, but my favourtie PF psychodelic album is A Saucerful Of Secrets. Also, If You're a beginner, don't start with this one; Go for Dark Side Of The Moon or Wish You Were Here.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I have followed the Enigma project for a long time, though this was actually the first Enigma album I had purchased. (Unless you count 'Pure Moods' compilations, which often featured tracks from Enigma albums.) However, I can say that this is one of the wisest purchasing decisions I have ever made, in terms of entertainment. L-S-D offers the most popular Enigma tracks on one compilation album. Of course, this album was released before 'Voyageur,' so you're not technically getting all the greatest hits. <br /> <br />Enigma is a combination of New Age and Electronic Ambience. Most of the vocals are performed by Sandra, the female vocalist, or are simply excerpts from various chanson albums. Most commonly, you will hear the phrase \\"O' fortuna, velut Luna.\\" (\\"Oh, fortune of the moon...\\") The chanson excerpts give Enigma's music a very mystifying feel. (Especially in combination with the electronic beats.) Otherwise, the lyrics are very philosophical and abstract, pertaining to the human mind and spirit. (Or the general state of the world, in some cases.) A lot of songs can be very uplifting, mystifying and thought-provoking. Others can be passionate and erotic. <br /> <br />Overall, I give this album 5 stars, as it is an excellent compilation of some of Enigma's greatest works. However, I do have one disagreement -- the re-arranged version of 'T.N.T. for the Brain.' I am not sure why the original version, found in 'Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!' was not featured in this album. Instead, it was decided that a re-arranged version be used. Don't get me wrong -- it is an okay song, but I generally perfer the original version. <br /> <br />On a side note, I would like to see a re-release of this album, pakaged along with the extended version of 'MCMXC a.D.,' and the 'Remember the Future' DVD. This would, more appropriately, be a greatest hits collection. However, there has not been any activity since 'Voyageur' was released. Hopefully, that will not be the final album...
B000000OQY|5.0|Another masterpiece from the Rockgods. What I always aprecciated  in GN'R is that all their stuff is so perferct. I like ALMOST each song they wrote. And Lies is another example of perfect album. This album is also very original conception - two sides with totally different stuff, hard rock and acoustic.    The entire thing starts with powerful, based on a strong guitar riff wild song \\"Reckless Life\\". It shows Guns crew in their best time and shows how much wild and powerful they were while playing live. Next one is a cover of an old, forgotten australian punk rock band, Rose Tattoo, \\"Nice Boys\\" which starts with a strong drums beat(impressive for Steven Adler!) and comes into a wild, punk song, that is really great. Move To The City is based on blues, and its rough n' tough, and I love the solo in it. Here we got something more - A song 'bout your f****** mother(too bad Axl) is a cover of Aerosmith classic Mama Kin. However, I'm a great fan of Aerosmith and finally i prefer Aerosmith version.    And this is where the wilderness ends. Time to chill out... Next song is one of band's most beautiful songs and my personal favourite, Patience. At first time it seems like just another simple acoustic song, but after listening to it few times you can feel this wonderful magic... Used To Love Her is a joke song, simple, few country chords, and words about girlfriend that was messing up and Axl had to bury her in backyard... good one. I love the acoustic version of You're Crazy. It's so cool. It can be powerful without distorted guitars and no punk stuff that it has on Appetite For Destruction. Last song is a beautiful ballad, One In A Million. However, the band suffered from this song, the critics were judging Axl and crew as rasists, but I think that's nonsense. I like this song.    I really love this CD and it sounds perfect on each song. I recommend it to each GN'R fan, but for beginners: maybe start with Appetite For Destruction. Final Mark: Amazing Great Masterpiece.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I was not prepared to see how weak this recording is. Both \\"plugged\\" and \\"unplugged\\" discs are weak. The rock CD is weak, the songs have no form, are just a mess of sounds.<br /><br />I knew that after THE COLOUR AND THE SHAPE the band could hardly record anything better ever, that album was a gem. But I did not suspect that this new album would be so weak.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I love all the songs on it they sound amazing Phill can win 56 grammys. I love the song \\"in the ait tonight\\" of course you never know what he means by that cause Phill doesn't say whats in the air but I don't care I go by how good the music sounds.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|I wasn't too thrilled with this movie. Story got somewhat boring at times and since i read the book and liked it, I expected something a little bit more fun. Overall, ok for a rainy day when you have nothing else to do.

B00000ICN5|5.0|i got into guitar with bands like iron maiden and metallica and with them my love of guitar solos was born.  however i liked more than just pure speed and technique, i needed emotion in my solos (that doesn't mean that speed has no emotion it's just different).  however i didn't know the perfect band or artist to find it in.  guns n roses was surprisingly bluesy to me but i knew there had to be more.  i found many others like clapton, page, beck, blackmore, and even some of the delta blues.  but those others sometimes lacked the raw energy that i had always given to my blues playing.  then my dad recommended stevie ray vaughan and though the name was familiar i hesitated.  but with texas flood i found the answer.  stevie's wild form of the blues has all the moves i need to base my solos off of.  i was blown away with his amazing talent and technique.  he was no british blues copy nor a delta blues copy.  he was texas style and i have all his cds and this one is still the best.  i listen to a lot of guitarists from the late 80's shredd, jazz, and instrumental, to straight up blues.  if you're looking to get a stevie ray cd or a great blues cd then look no further.  i know i rambled on so i'll just say now buy it you will not regret it.
B0008G2IRO|4.0|Gave this a listen the other day -- very strong, beat-heavy, groove-based material.  Sounds to my ears a bit like Thomas Dolby, updated, with Ray Davies on vocals.  Note the Kinks-like harmonies throughout.  Very interesting sonically, cleanly-produced, this one is an interesting side project well worth the price of admission.
0375507256|3.0|The first half of the book is wonderful, with compelling and very different genres, each well done, such that I thought I was in for a treat of the caliber of Calvino's Once Upon a Winter's Night a Traveler. While the book is wonderful and well worth reading, the second half is a mild disappointment. The author's skill is still present, but some of the narrative becomes \\"message fiction\\" that is intrusive and simplistic (journalism good, corporations bad, and can't we all just get along).
6305922756|5.0|The movie itself is the 'mockumentary' that all others will be judged by...forever. It's done in a deadpan documentary style that will leave unwitting viewers wondering why the producers didn't pick a better band to follow. There's no laugh track, there's no winking at the audience, and there's no need; almost every moment is funny. To say this parodies 80's heavy metal music isn't quite accurate, the heavy metal jokes extend well back into the 70's, and there's even a couple jabs taken at Hendrix and some 60's bands. There's a masterful weaving of verbatim incidents from heavy metal lore, with some that are blended or slightly exaggerated for comedic effect. All of it lovingly 'documented' by Rob Reiner as Marty DiBergi. The writing by Shearer, Reiner, Guest, and McKean is excellent, and extends past the dialogue to the music and lyrics, which are an integral part of the overall humor. AS good as the original movie is, the DVD manages to build on it. The track where the characters comment on the movie, still in character, as if the characters were watching an actual documentary about themselves, is the best DVD commentary track yet. Turn your speakers up to 11 and enjoy! <br />
B00079018K|5.0|Isn't there a way reviewers can warn people about the copy-protected disc...WITHOUT penalizing the band/music with 1,2 or 3 star reviews?  This is at least a 4(maybe 5) release easily.  The copy-protection is bad i know, but the music.....<br /><br />Did you like the Happy Mondays/Stone Roses/Charlatans/Inspiral Carpets Britpop/rock of the 90's?  Do you like recent UK acts like The Music and Soul Hooligan?  Do you enjoy trippy, catchy, cool, hip, body-movin', psychadelic, up-tempo songs that rock?  If yes, find a way to buy or borrow this excellent cd.  To me, they sound like a BETTER version of The Music(Kasabian's singer has a less grating voice and their music is tighter, more distinct) but with an electronic edge akin to Soul Hooligan(though to a lesser dgree) with the added extra bonus of the swagger and pomp of a Stone Roses or Happy Mondays.  If you still aren't convinced, click on the music samples and check'em out(they're free),  but if you can't:<br /><br />* Club Foot- great energetic song, i see why people love this one but...(A)<br /><br />* Processed Beats-...gets my vote for track of the album!  ultra-catchy, trippy # that gets you high with no need for chemical substances. (A)<br /><br />* Reason is Treason- really good, fast pop-sounding song. (A)<br /><br />* I.D.- heavily electronic opening and awkward at first. give it about a minute until the vocals kick in, and you'll get an edgy psychadelic, slow tempo song.

(B)<br /><br />* Test Transmission- starts kinda slow...then goes into hyper-catchy mode after he starts singing.  you just feel good listening to so many distinct, catchy, fun yet edgy, groovable and movable songs!  sorry, got carried away there. (A)<br /><br />* Pinch Roller- (brief instrumental)<br /><br />* Cut it Off- mid-tempo # with a nice laid back beat. i'm not a fan of his singing in a 'talking'-kind of way here.  but the music is there, esp. some cool keyboards later.

B0009H1CKG|1.0|Presentation poor, band looked rough, playing sloppy apart from occasional solos by horn section, weak grooves. PAST SELL BY DATE I'm afraid. Expected full on funk... NOT. <br /> <br />I bought Chic Live at Montreaux along with this DVD, 5 STAR FUNK! how it should be!  <br /> <br />Sold this turkey on Ebay the next day. P Funk? POOR FUNK
B0009YNRZM|5.0|This isn't really a review so much as a response to Zappafreak's claim that this CD is censored.  Having just listened to it, I can assure readers that this disc is identical to the original 1968 LP.  I'm guessing that Zappafreak is referring to the omission of a few bits that were restored on the heavily remixed and overdubbed version of We're Only In It For The Money that was released in the '80s on a disc paired with Lumpy Gravy.  While I agree that it would have been nice to hear these censored portions included (particularly in the album's original mix), I believe that MFSL's primary goal is to restore--to the best of their ability--the *original* album.  Therefore, I think it's pretty unfair to accuse these guys of bastardizing Frank's work.  In fact, this CD has the same content as the \\"FZ approved\\" edition that Ryko released in 1995.  And say, I just noticed that the front cover of this version actually has all the black bars removed from the people's faces.  How 'bout that?<br /><br />As for the sound quality, MFSL did pretty good job given the source material.  While there is still some noticeable distortion and fuzz here and there, the album certainly sounds crisper and cleaner than the current Ryko version.  Whether or not it's worth the upgrade mainly depends on how fussy you are over some minute quality variations.  The sound quality most likely won't blow you away, but I can't imagine this album sounding any better.  I definitely won't be needing my old CD anymore.

B0000AUHPK|4.0|This is a wonderful movie version of the classic Wuthering Heights with Ralph Fiennes being the best Heathcliff I have seen.  Also, Amazon did an excellent job sending this DVD to me fast.
B00005JNTX|5.0|If there's anything you knew in advance about \\"Sin City\\" (aside from who gets naked -- show a little class dammit) it's that director Robert Rodriquez went as far out of his way as humanly possible to make this film adhere as closely as possible to the visual feel of the comic book source material.  Well, I haven't read any of Frank Miller's legendary \\"Sin City\\" comics, but having seen the movie, I can't imagine it existing without them.Many people will see similarities between \\"Sin City\\" and the work of Quentin Tarantino, both because Robert Rodriquez will probably never break free from this stigma no matter how many kiddie flicks he makes, and more importantly -- gulp -- he actually inviteds QT on board to direct one of the segments, this after he'd torn up his DGA membership card in disgust after they wouldn't allow him to list Frank Miller as a co-director, so as far as integrity goes it's hard to one-up Sir Robert here.  I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to which segment QT was supposed to be directing ahead of viewing this flick, and it's to the film's credit that it all seems of a piece no matter how the chores were divvied up.    Now, there are a couple of things that are immediately going to weed out a certain part of the older audience (hello Ma!), this being the \\"artsy\\" use of black-and-white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences.  I shouldn't diss the so-called \\"older\\" audience, being in my third decade of existence myself, but my parents and everyone else their age have certain prejudices toward a particular kind of modern film, this being the type that has \\"far fetched\\" action sequences.  Yes, in \\"Sin City\\" the characters are able to take a ridiculous amount of bullets and keep on ticking as well as jumping out of windows several stories to the ground without any apparent injuries, but to that I say that there is a reason this kind of thing works in a film like \\"Sin City\\" whereas it can easily wear thin in a movie like, say, \\"The Matrix\\".  Sin City is portrayed as a hopelessly fatalistic backdrop against which the best the characters can hope for is to die with a little bit of dignity.  It doesn't really matter that Marv doesn't croak after taking a bullet to the head because you know the dice are gonna roll cold for him sooner or later.Another comparison people may make to Tarantino is to point out that \\"Sin City\\" is also an anthology film.  I could mention the fact that this is based on three graphic novels featuring different protagonists and leave it at that, but -- at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose \\"Pulp Fiction\\" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right -- it should be noted that QT did not, in fact, actually INVENT the anthology film.  No, that would be George Romero and Stephen King with \\"Creepshow\\" (I'm kidding, of course, but you get my point...).      Aside from the anthology aspect, there is one thing that actually does somewhat resemble \\"Pulp Fiction\\":  Bruce Willis' character makes an early exit only to return later in the film.  It's not the same chronological gimmick that QT utilized but I've said enough as it is.The one aspect that got so much press in the film's pre-release was the unprecedented decision to film the entire movie in front of a green screen.  This move not only doesn't come off as a gimmick but you'll find yourself forgetting that \\"Sin City\\" isn't absolutely real about five minutes into the movie.  Sure, there are numerous improbabilities, as detailed above, but it's the MOVEMENT of the characters, vehicles, weapons, etc. that seem a bit cartoonish;  nothing about the actual scenery really does.  In essence, \\"Sin City\\" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling:  great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption.  Bruce Willis was an absolute no-brainer for this flick:  he's spent the last decade perfecting this world-weary gutter saint character, and \\"Sin City\\" is arguably his best portrait of this tortured soul archetype yet.  Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are the three main protagonists, and you'll find yourself rooting for them not through point-of-view bias alone, but because each of these guys completely earns the right to be called a bad ass.  In a way I'm glad they saved the fate of Willis' character for last as the whole movie seems to be building to such tragedy.    So, yes, it's unfortunate that so many people will rent this movie sheerly on the recommendation of Mr. Skin, but hopefully \\"Sin City\\" will turn more than a few heads on to a new, hightened quality of experimental film-making in the same way that the aforementioned \\"Pulp Fiction\\" did a decade ago.  Word is that Rodriquez is planning two back-to-back sequels as we speak.
B000002MJ0|5.0|My Bloody Valentine has always been one band I really didn't know what to think about. Whenever I listen to them, I can't really depict if I should feel so stupid for listening to this odd arrangement of noises or break down and weep for each beautiful and perfect note that is played. When I bought this album, a couple weeks after I bought Loveless, I knew exactly how I should feel about this band. This CD has been in my player for a few days now and shows no sign of returning to its case. This album is like listening to bursting nebulas made into song. I never really thought something this perfect, this beautiful could actually be written, recorded, and produced. Each layer of guitar or vocals seems to fit so well, like putting together a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle for every track. I'm going to try to find every scrap of music ever recorded by MBV now as fast as I can, because something this good can't wait another second.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Back in 1988, Martin Scorsese suffered through a great deal of controversy due to his fictionalized imaginings of Jesus' human characteristics in \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\".  Now, sixteen years later, Mel Gibson comes under similar scrutiny, but though it is easy to draw comparisons between the two cases, it's the differences that shed the most light on \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".  First of all, Gibson's take is faithful to the source material in the extreme, which is completely the opposite of what got Scorsese into trouble.  The controversy over \\"The Passion...\\" isn't whether it's blasphemous -- I don't think I've heard a single person claim that it is -- but whether the visceral depiction of Christ's sufferings were gratuitous or necessary to get the point across.  The purpose of this review is solely to examine this central question, as I believe it's crucial to whether or not this is a great film or merely a good one.  Hopefully, by the time I'm done, I'll have elucidated myself with enough detail that you'll be able to tell without seeing the film whether you agree or disagree, and if the latter, whether you would have a contrary opinion of the film's quality as well.    First of all, I hold true that - in fact - the mere depiction of Jesus' torture in graphically realistic terms is NOT an end in and of itself.  To claim the opposite to me would be to give credence to the type of people who stand outside state capitols hoisting posters of mangled fetuses -- whether you're for or against abortion, in other words, your decision should be based on sound ethical arguments and not how gruesome the surgical procedure itself actually is.  Similarly, it would be the utmost of shallowness to base one's faith in Christ in feeling sorry for the guy for the physical pain he went through.  This almost seems common sensically obvious once stated as such, but one can never belie the sway a good \\"tear jerker\\" has over the emotions of it's audience.  So with the above conjectures laid out, it seems that we must by necessity rule out the value of the film based solely on the historical authenticity of it's depiction.  But what else does it have to offer if authenticity will not suffice?    Honestly, the authenticity seems to be where Gibson is laying most of his cards, although \\"The Passion...\\" is far from the droll sterility of, say, \\"The Alamo\\", to use another historically authentic (yet dramatically static) example.  Jim Caviezel as Christ does everything you could ask out of him given the demands of the script:  he's assertive, secure in his beliefs, and displays a certain kind of humanity, although Gibson's treatment of Christ in this respect demands a different kind of humanity than Scorsese wrought out of Willem Defoe.  This Christ is not unsure of his heritage and his mission, only his ability to withstand the physical consequences he will have to endure.  And, true to his mission, Gibson certainly puts Caviezal's Christ through the wringer.  In fact, even if you're willing to accept that the concept of historic authenticity is riveting in and of it's own right, it's hard not to feel that Gibson may be going a little overboard here.  By the time Jesus is finished being put through his scourging, it's already become hard to believe that a human being could withstand as much punishment and continue to live.  Even if he'd suddenly been pardoned before the Crucifixion, in other words, it's impossible to believe that a mortal man could have healed from the wounds inflicted during the scourging, and without this dramatic element the journey to the Cross cannot help but be an anti-climax by comparison.      Ultimately, I think even the most devout Christians would have to agree that the compelling story of Christ is not by what abuse of the flesh he met his demise, but by what persecution and theological uncertainty he lived his life up until then.  Without that there would be no story of Christ to pass down over the millenia, as history reveals that Christ was not by any means unique in the extremes of his physical torment, torture being a fairly commonplace device up until very recent times (and with the sketchy revelations of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, who's to say even now this is the case?).  By this measure I'd have to give the nod to Scorsese's film, historically inaccurate or no, as at least it goes to some lengths to try and understand what a born mortal would have to come to grips with given Christ's pedigree.      Ultimately, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" tells us next to nothing about Christ's mission on Earth -- someone who had by some means escaped any previous mention of Christianity would certainly not be able to piece together it's tenets based on what they have to go on here -- which leaves nothing else to judge but the merits of a blow-by-blow orgy of violence against the alleged Messiah.  In brief segments, Jesus is shown in flashbacks preaching to his flock, but these segments are short and fragmentary, not so much underlining what it is that Jesus was sacrificing himself for as contrasting the \\"good old days\\" when he was flying underneath the political radar, free from the later tyrannical fallout of the dominant religious groups, and as these scenes in their brevity and the sense of their editing fail to provide the film with a dualistic message, we must once again fall back on the central thesis that historical vivacity is an end in it's own right.  Hopefully we have shown in pertinent detail why this cannot be the case.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I've read the other reviews, and I somewhat agree with most. I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality; though a buddy of Tarantino, he can still maintain his individuality and integrity. One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of \\"parallel universe\\" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent. Watching this was so much fun!
B00030590I|5.0|While I understand the complaints of some that the plot was either repetitive or difficult to follow, I nevertheless was blown away by this film.  The visuals, the scenes, are unlike anything I've ever seen before.  In the \\"making of\\" featurette, Zheng Yimou says that one of his overriding goals was to create images which would come back to viewer, again and again.  The fights were beyond beautifully choreographed -- what we're to come away with are the unforgettable scenes:  Falling Snow and Moon fighting among the whirlwind of leaves.  Nameless and Broken Sword moving back and forth over the mirror lake.  The anonymous demanding hoarde of Courtiers, all in black.  Green silk, cascading like water from the ceiling of the King's palace.  And my favorite, Nameless and Falling Snow fighting off an impossible swarm of arrows, as Broken Sword dances with the caligraphy brush and blood red ink.<br /><br />There's far more, and for me, the film invites many repeat viewings.  I feel like I've only just scratched the surface of it...and the images haunt me.<br /><br />If one is looking for a straightforward martial arts action movie, or an easy-to-follow plot, one may be disappointed.  That wasn't my goal, so I wasn't.<br /><br />I saw this film as a parable, and as a gorgeous series of visual poems -- very Chinese, exquisitely beautiful.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I cannot resist this band and will always buy their cds any time they release one, no question. If you're mad or vindictive, and are seeking retribution, I think this could be your band, too. ;)<br /><br />I think I like almost every song, and they have songs I can listen to over and over and get stuck in my head and I don't even mind. Isn't that a rare thing? I wake up with their music in my head and it colors the landscape of my dreams. They are not trendy, in my mind, since I bought the first cd when it came out, and I always come back to it. They have music good for dark days, and some for better days when you just need something mildly devious and just want to smile knowingly. I would go into a burning building to get their cds out, or buy them again if they were stolen, taking solace that the thief likes good music too.<br /><br />Do not abandon hope; there is great music out there that will speak to you, if not for you, when you have no voice at all.<br /><br />Buy this if your soul is wounded and angry. It has helped me heal.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is fabulous at what it tries to be, a piece of noir fiction that let's us believe that the good will always win out over the bad. This film isn't realism, the art deco raindrops and exaggerated physical attributes tell you that. Instead, it provides us with a black and white world where the bad people are remarkably bad and the good people are bad as well. Only, the good people find something worthwhile to stand up for and that redeems them. I wouldn't want to live in Sin City but if Sin City did exist, I would want to know that Marv, Hartigan, Dwight and Gail are there to protect the rest of us. I enjoyed the film as a whole but have to admit that Mickey Rourke's Marv stole the show. Bruce Willis gave me pretty much what I expected and I found Clive Owen surprisingly good in a tough-guy role but Rourke was worth the price of the DVD alone. As a one-man killing machine, Rourke was exceptionally good. I'd always been a fan of his work but was disappointed with the direction his career took the last decade or so. Hopefully this is the start of a resurgence for him.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I have said it once, but I think it should be said again, I love this band. I missed Chris Cornell's work when SoundGarden parted ways. I am happier than ever with this band and its direction. I bought the first cd as a gift and once I heard it myself, wished I had kept it. When I heard this cd, (their second), it has been at a time in my life when I needed it the most. This is what Audioslave has done for me ceaselessly; they have written music that I can sing as if it were my own, as it is felt by me. I think a lot of people feel this way, and it makes the band family. The lyrics are mesmerizing, elusive, inebriating, seductive and potent. If you like this band, then you will love this band. It is not a pleasure that you will or should be ashamed of, I assure you. The music is rugged, yet intelligent and smooth. I don't buy cds from very many bands, as I have been disappointed by lesser bands. This is not a lesser band. They are eloquent and experienced, and I think you will see it too.<br /><br />Audioslave is sharp.
B000A88F22|1.0|Does anyone know if there is a list of songs played during each episode?  I really liked a song that was played during the wedding episode...had lyrics that stated, \\"Today is the sweetest day that I...\\".  It was playing when Britney was getting ready.  Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
B000AA4LAK|4.0|If you're a Killers fan who already has the Hot Fuss cd in its original form, & you're wondering EXACTLY what the differences here are, here you go: <br /> <br />3 b-sides/non-album tracks have been tacked on to the end of the cd. <br /> <br />\\"Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll\\" was a track previously only found on the UK verson of Hot Fuss.  \\"Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" & \\"Under The Gun\\" have appeared on several of the band's import singles.  All tracks are good, but \\"Under The Gun\\" is exceptional & should have been on the album from the beginning. <br /> <br />\\"All These Things That I Have Done\\" is a slightly different mix on this edition.  The gospel choir from the mid-section of the song is heard longer near the end, as they accompany Brandon during the \\"don't you put me on the back-burner...\\" chorus.  Not a huge difference, but it adds some more energy.  This is the version that radio stations are now playing. <br /> <br />As for the artwork, the cd booklet is exactly the same with 2 exceptions.  Besides the obvious cover photo change (from blue to black), Brandon Flowers' solo picture has mysteriously disappeared in favor of a blank, black page.  Perhaps he wants us to forget about that shag haircut he had when the cd first came out? <br /> <br />So there you have it.  Those are the only differences, but if you don't already have the 3 bonus tracks, I'd say they're WELL worth the ten bucks that I spent on this.  Be sure to check out \\"Under The Gun\\"!!!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Francis Lawrence's apocaliptic thriller constatine is one of the best movies i have seen in months it has great charecter devlopment a very imagnitive storyline well acted by keanu reeves and rachel weisz as the main actors definatly worth watching
0517591812|5.0|It is almost like many mini stories, each with there own suspense and tiny cliffhangers. The story flows and moves and you are there in London with the characters.  The story weaves through fictional characters around real events and people. With every chapter you are filled with a better understanding of life in London, and who we are.  Excellent read!! I recommend The Other Boleyn Girl as a follow up read.

B000AP04NI|5.0|The good news with the upcoming 2005 release of OKLAHOMA! is that both the TODD-AO and CinemaScope versions will be released. I seem to be alone in preferring the CinemaScope version to the TODD-AO, mainly for reasons of musical integrity. The initial post-scoring seems to have been done with the CinemaScope print. It's with the TODD-AO print that small nips and tucks are heard in some of the dance arrangements to compensate for the synchronization to the dancing in that version. That said, the TODD-AO finale is a bit longer and more elaborate. Also, contrary to popular opinion, I think the performances are slightly better in the CinemaScope version, especially those of Gloria Graham and Charlotte Greenwood. It will be wonderful to have both versions on DVD.
B000000NN1|5.0|or  at  least  decades,  that  Greek  guy  that  was <br />  slated  for  Wakeman's  section  of  the  stage did  an <br />  RCA  records  soloist-gig. Then,  this  recording  was <br />  released.  <br />  Then,  not  selling  as  much  as  RUMOURS  or  BOSTON, <br />  it  got  shoved  back  into  the  cut-racks. THEN, it  <br />  was  reworked  into  THE  OMEN  soundtrack. <br />  And  it  literally  took ' CHARIOTS...

0553278223|4.0|*One of the reviews posted here says that this version of the book has had a story taken out (\\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\"), but actually that story is in the book. Maybe that person had a faulty copy or something, but this version has not been edited.<br /><br />About the book itself: Although I had to read it for school, I found that I actually ended up liking it. The stories themselves are often somewhat bland, serving as conduits for a larger idea or theme, but I thought that the ideas the book presented were thoughtful and intriguing and some of the stories were interesting as well. As far as storyline, there are very few strong characters and the plots can be confused, isolated, and conflicting, but as it is a series of short stories and not a novel, this can be forgiven to some extent. All in all The Martian Chronicles held my interest and introduced me to some interesting ideas.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|I expected this movie to be about treasure hunting. Heck, the dvd even says a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond. Yeah, right! This wasn't anywhere near Indiana Jones. It seemed to me that the treasure-hunting was just a backdrop for the rest of the events in the movie. <br /> <br />The cast was great but the characters were too weak. They had some cheezy lines. I thought the script was pretty bad. In the end, it seemed to me that the bad guy had a good idea to start with, that just went wrong. Given time, he would have fixed it.  <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this movie and was sorely disappointed. It's a good action movie that you can watch to pass the time.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|DC is doing it again. Let's face it, when one pictured the \\"Dark Knight\\" of Frank Miller, did they expect a Cesar Romero Joker in Burton's Batman? No. Did they expect pop music and \\"chick's dig the car\\"? No. And who didn't think of \\"Scooby Doo Meets Batman\\" when Clooney pulled out the Batman Credit Card?  <br /> <br />Honstly I was expecting Batman V to have Alfred serving bat cookies. <br /> <br />Finally they get it right! Batman is above all a drama. It is about the humanity behind these characters, not the joke cracking Webhead. <br /> <br />DC realises that Batman is an intelligent comic. While certainly some of the character over the years were over the top, my generation found a Batman and his archvillians who were DANGEROUS. They were characters who were three dimensional. They were flesh and blood and could be coming to a city near you.  <br /> <br />Who doesn't laugh with the line, \\"love that Joker\\"? This time, Batman's enemy Scarecrow was a freaky character with an actor who, no offense, looked like Joan Rivers in cosmetic surgery heaven. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is. <br /> <br />Batman needed to be fleshed out and in this film he was. Yes, it was more about Bruce Wayne. And Smallville is about Clark Kent. But this is what makes Batman interesting, in that he is an alter-ego, not the person himself. By coming to gripes with people we reach an emotional attachment, an in depth analysis of how they tick. We care for them. And this is the purpose of drama, which Batman is.  <br /> <br />I honestly have no desire to contrast Keaton with Bale,because they are two different versions of Batman. Keaton was good at what he did. In fact, when comparing to Kilmer and Clooney, give me Keaton all day and all night. However, Bale's Batman is what we have all been dreaming about, namely a Batman that showed true purpose and that became real. <br /> <br />My apologies because I think most here have been much more eloquent and detailed in their reviews.  <br/> <br />Looking forward to the next one.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakria burst onto the scene in 2001 with this album.<br /><br />Firstly she is not just another blonde, nor is she a one-hit wonder. She is a real musical talent that should be taken very seriously. If you thought \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" was commercial pap, you are wrong. There are many songs on this album that have the same commercial potential that the debut single had, and also the first single is a fresh blend of many genres.<br /><br />Now don't think this is her debut album, no it isn't, she is a superstar in the Spanish speaking world.<br /><br />Huge infact, and this album will cement her across the world.<br /><br />Now getting down to the musical side of things.<br /><br />Shakira writes or co-writes every single track and also lends a hand in the production side of things. She really is pure class with the way she sings. Her voice has a unique timbre and gruff tones. In the Spanish songs she sings amazingly.<br /><br />The way this album uses a wide range of genres is simply really superb. Whether it be folk, salsa or rock Shakira covers it and puts it to use. Unknown instruments pop up everywhere, instruments such as the bandoneon, charango, rondador and the quena flute. All this linguistic jumble equates to a satisfying and authentic blend of music.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"Laundry Service\\" simply because the sound is very unique and the music is very well structured.<br /><br />Some critics I think may have panned it because they may not have been immersed in this sort of music befor, however neither have I and it totally works for me.
B000002LSV|5.0|This Texas rock group still has the chops and the greatest hits CD makes it clear why the band has staying power.  The guitar riffs are still exciting and the bass is sure to rattle the windows of home or car. All in all, a worthwhile addition to the collection of any rock fan.
B000002AGN|4.0|There's not much needs to be said about this album really. It's a perfectly catchy and listenable piece of accessable jazz that, although being grounbreaking in one respect, is still very much of it's time. <br /> <br />The main theme (or gimick if you're feeling less generous) of this album is that nearly every part of it is played in time signiatures that are irregular, or rather, more relevantly, unknown to jazz music of the time (hence the name \\"Time Out\\"). The great achievement of this album is that Brubeck succeeded not only in creating coherent music out of a musical style that at the time was considered to be inaccesible and innapropriate for jazz, but that he used these apparently inaccesible time signiatures to make music that was incredibly catchy, didnt seem at all unnatural and enjoyed huge commercial success. <br /> <br />There are some really ludicrously catchy parts of this album, namely the melodic section of Take Five and the head for Blue Rondo Alla turk, thanks to Brubecks very competent handling of supposedly inflammatory musical forms. Indeed, many of the most exciting moments during this album come purely from observing the time signiature changes (with which the sleve notes are very helpful) and counting on your fingers, desperately trying to follow. I never thought i would find a fast tempo 3/4 turning almost imperceptibly into a slow 4/4 ( or 12/8 as the 3/4 turns into triplets in one beat of the slow 4/4) to be so exciting. <br /> <br />Generally what you find on this album is an overall very competent set of musicians playing around with strange time signiatures and soloing adequately. The only acception to this is paul desmond who is sure to wow you into submission with his beautiful, haunting, sweet-singing sax tone. He has good control of phrasing (as you need to on an album of such tricky time changes) and his motivic development too feels rather accomplished and always very natural, but really its the tone he manages to achieve thatis the most striking thing about his playing and on the entire album, as you may have already noticed if you are already familiar with the spectacularly sensitive sax part on the famous Take Five track. His beautiful tone and rather subtle playing are most apparent against the rest of the band on the second track, strange meadow lark. The piece starts with an extended intro by Dave Brubeck playing solo and is followed by Desmond on sax, playing the same melody that Brubeck played in the intro. Hearing the same melody played by the 2 different players just makes Desmonds beautiful playing stand out so much and really does wonders for that melody line. <br /> <br />One aspect of the album where Brubeck seems to fall short is in the endings. Going on the tracks from this album alone it would seem that Dave Brubeck does not know how to end pieces of music. Every track seems to either end with one of those cliched jazz descending arpeggios that feels somewhat like its been jammed in too early or just slowly fizzles out in the style that the piece started in. Generally this leaves most of the tracks with a feeling of anticlimax. <br /> <br />Another issue i have with this album is that it, to me, exemplifies one of the worst things about cool jazz, that it is litterally cool in every way to the point of being rather emotionally unenvolved. A masterful jazz musician like Bill Evans can play cool jazz but still throw his heart and soul into it and thus create some really spellbinding music. Aside from the odd moments of stellar beauty that come from Paul Desmond this album really has no real emotional content. It's ok but theres not really anything to make you fall in love with the music. In short, it's parlour music. <br /> <br />Conclusion: <br /> <br />I liked this album. As i said, there are some totally beautiful bits, thanks mainly to Paul Desmond, and there are some criminally catchy moments that do really make you (if only for a few seconds) stop everything you're doing and play some air saxophone, but really theres nothing particularly magical about this album. <br /> <br />This is not really the work of any kind of musical mastermind. The experiments into time signiatures were a bold move and really paid off and Dave Brubeck shall always be remembered for it but what he does with the compositions themselves is rather unadventurous and somewhat underwhelming. Overall, a fairly well made and fairly enjoyable album.
0783225725|5.0|If you only saw this movie on television, the complete version is a must for all Clint Eastwood fans.  The movie version gives a more complete picture of Clint's character, as well as the motivation of the supporting characters.  No Eastwood fan should be without this movie.
B00003CX9E|1.0|This review will be short and sweet.  Adding nothing new to the one star reviews, I simply say I laughed when this film was chosen as the greatest film in American History!
B00005JNTX|1.0|Sin City is an empty, hollow, incoherent, poorly edited, pathological piece of snuff porn; it tries to gloss over this with lots of beautiful camera work, but it's just like putting a silk dress on a rotting corpse. Each of this movie's stories are  so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash. Great stuff, if you think like Lynndie England.
0634060384|5.0|This fake book was exactly as the same as the other Real books I bought under the counter at music stores in years past. It was half the price of the illegal books to boot! Highly recommended.
B00005JNTX|4.0|`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown-up men. As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.<br /><br />As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.<br /><br />I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.<br /><br />For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.<br /><br />The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.<br /><br />All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.<br /><br />But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?<br /><br />I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!<br /><br />Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.<br /><br />It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.k heroes and heavies.

B0000024PC|4.0|Whimsical soundtrack to the 1967 Mike Nichol's film blends the foxtrot generation with the soft-core hippie music of '60s Simon and Garfunkel. Hence, you get the folkish and electric versions of \\"Sounds of Silence\\" alongside '40s cocktail lounge big band that sounds like your local TV station holding a telethon, and a hot striptease blues number, (in the film it's when Dustin Hoffman takes Katharine Ross to a strip joint), with blazing sax and rolling drum solo. The centerpiece here is Simon's traditional English folk, \\"Scarborough Fair\\", with it's precise musicbox harpsichord sounding impossibly perfect. And, where have you gone, \\"Mrs. Robinson\\"? Only the first altered stanza is found here, as it was in the movie.

0440234743|5.0|This was the first Grisham book I read, and I was so impressed with it I couldn't wait to read more.<br /><br />On the surface, the story deals with the suicide of self-made billionaire, Troy Phelan, who proceeds to write all of his known heirs out of his final will, and leaves 11 billion dollars to an unknown illegitimate child (now a missionary living on the border between Brazil and Bolivia with an Indian tribe). The inevitable legal battle is waged as those written out of the will seek to contest the will.<br /><br />However, deeper than that, the story is a simple tale of redemption for one of its principal characters, Nate O'Reilly. He has done everything under the sun - cocaine, is an alcoholic, cheated on his wives, was never there for his kids, and is being indicted on tax evasion charges. Now I'm not a religious person, but I was moved by his renewed faith in God, his acceptance for past mistakes, and his battle to leave his past and addictions behind, instead concentrating on how he can improve his life in the future.<br /><br />Grisham does a fine job with his vivid descriptions of the Pantanal (that he'd been there obviously helped) and the legal battle is compelling. Yet it is work on the descriptions of the characters that Grisham has truly excelled - we despise the Phelan heirs as much as we admire Nate. For those who've never battled alcoholism (I'd be one of them - rarely ever touch the stuff!), Grisham does a fine job making us understand the battle that they face and evoking a grudging admiration for those who do fight against the addiction.<br /><br />This is the best Grisham novel I have read to date and thoroughly recommend it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|If you don't like violence, scantly clad women or graphic comics in general, then this is probably not the movie for you. But the fact is, this film (based on Frank Miller's graphic comics) and its directors (Rodriguez, Tarantino and Miller himself) should be commended. Shot entirely behind green screen technology this film does, in many ways, what the Matrix did by redefining movie-making and what we will see on the big-screen in the future. Simply stated, this movie is an unapologetic feast for the eyes; everything you'd expect from a movie titled \\"Sin City.\\" But because of the recent split within Miramax the \\"Special Edition\\" version of Sin City won't be out until next year some time, but if you're a fan or could care less about the extra features (for now), then jump right on in, the water is fine.
B00005JMEW|1.0|I liked Tarantino's Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br />I rented this because it starred Uma Thurman and I love samurai movies. <br /> <br />Too bad this and part 2 are PRETENTIOUS trash. As I watched some scenes unfold, I was actually embarassed for Quentin.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Released in 1986, Lifes Rich Pageant was R.E.M.'s fourth album and a major step forward for the band.  I thought there would be many more triumphs for this quartet from Athens, GA.  Instead it became their artistic swan song, and 19 years later Lifes Rich Pageant is still their greatest album.<br /><br />My then-teenage hopes that they would go on, go on to be worthy successors to groups like Big Star, and in turn become the finest rock and roll band of all time, were dashed and crushed over the years by million-selling junk such as \\"Shiny Happy People\\", \\"Stand\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts\\".  R.E.M. never surpassed the hard-driving rock/pop sound of this album.  In fact, they never even came close.  I wasted sums of money on subsequent albums waiting for that promise to be filled, watching with chagrin their multiplying album sales and withering artistry.<br /><br />It is ironic to think that many of my contemporaries viewed this album with suspicion and contempt.  \\"They're getting ready to sell out,\\" they warned.  I didn't get it.  Today I do.  Heard in 2005, Lifes Rich Pageant is the sound of a band gearing up to completely sell out their integrity for the promise of platinum albums, untold riches, Top 40 airplay, massive stadium tours and an ultimately dubious fame.<br /><br />Today, it seems crazy to think that at one time R.E.M. was in the same league as the Replacements.  But they were, and when I heard Lifes Rich Pageant, I heard the sound of a band that had practically revolutionized college radio and invented the category \\"alternative music\\" unite with conventional, hard-driving pop.<br /><br />The results were unbelievable, such as \\"Begin The Begin\\", \\"These Days\\", \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Just A Touch\\", which are only four of the very best songs of the 1980s.  Was \\"Fall On Me\\" a bit too radio-friendly?  Yes.  Was \\"Superman\\" nothing more than a blatant play for a Top Ten hit?  Sure, but who cared?  This was the sound of a band about to burst the envelope of pop music, a sound that would ultimately wrest the throne of rock and roll away from mindless, overwrought groups such as Guns N'Roses.  And I was going to follow them on that ride.<br /><br />Five years later, they were singing \\"Shiny Happy People\\", trying to save the world one song at a time, and I was thoroughly disgusted.<br /><br />Soon after the total triumph of Lifes Rich Pageant, the band put out Document, which featured junk such as \\"The One I Love\\" and the intolerable frat-party staple \\"It's The End of The World As We Know It\\".  I was a freshman in college and went to see them in Chicago at the UIC Pavilion.  It should have been exciting, but when the band launched into \\"The One I Love\\", I should have been transformed.  Instead, I was utterly and completely bored.<br /><br />Of course, Document was the album that began to sell, which led to the awful follow-up Green, and songs like \\"Stand\\" and the wonderfully titled \\"Pop Song 89\\" -- songs guaranteed to drive you completely insane.  Yet I bought those pieces of garbage -- and played them a LOT -- just searching.  Waiting for R.E.M. to put out another album that even approached the majesty of Lifes Rich Pageant.  Did they come through?  They did not.<br /><br />Next came the mindless, self-important Out of Time, with \\"Losing My Religion\\" and the aforementioned \\"Shiny Happy People\\", which would have been the song that turned me off of R.E.M forever had it not been for the truly mind-rotting \\"Everybody Hurts\\", featured on Automatic for the People and the song that indeed caused me to turn my back on this pretentious, navel-gazing group of jags forever.<br /><br />Today, I have no idea what R.E.M. is up to.  I don't even care.  I'm 36 and other bands have my attention.  But the other day, my dentist, of all people, had Lifes Rich Pageant in his stereo as he was cleaning my teeth.  Halfway through, he looked at me and said, \\"This is a great, great album.\\"  Then he sighed.  I looked at him and knew what that meant.  It was thesigh of a promise that was not only broken, but broken in the most cruel and sad fashion possible.he most cruel and sad fashion possible.
B00000K0E5|5.0|This is the best Bond Film since Octopussy. Pierce Brosnan gives an excellent performance as Bond, and the villians are performed admirably by Sean Bean and Famke Janssen. The pre-credits scene is also the best since Octopussy. This film is a must have for every Bond Fan!
B000002UAO|5.0|Yeah, Rubber Soul's a pretty good record.  Those two guys, Lennon and McCartney?  It's becoming clear to me now -- they were really talented!  Those Beatles sure could do a lot more than just put out perfect little three-minute dittys (hundreds of them, to be accurate)!  They also could experiment with different sounds and explore lyrics beyond just \\"I love you, and I hope you love me\\", but have it all sound just like their previous records.  Yet at the same time, have it sound totally different!  That's no easy task!  They sure made it look easy, didn't they?  Rubber Soul has also stood the test of time!  Look at its sales ranking on Amazon.com!  Impressive!<br /><br />I'm beginning to realize that when you talk about the all-time great music of the 20th century, you really have to discuss the Beatles, and in particular this album.  It really started a chain of amazing albums that ended only with the Beatles' breakup!  Not bad!
B00000K0EA|2.0|A super villian want to start a war between China and Great Britain, and the reason why is because he wants a media foothold in China? This is the worst plot for a Bond Film hands down. Trying to give Bond an equal female partner is getting old. Doesen't anyone remember Anya Amasova from The Spy who Loved Me. The only good part about this film is Pierce Brosnan. However he can't save this mess.
0142001104|5.0|I am very impressed with this book...its messages are simple with great examples that are practical and down to earth. This is definitely not a self help book but more a lessons learned about being more human and effective in any pursuit. <br /> <br />I love it and recommend it to my clients.
B00028HBKM|5.0|On February 25, 2004 at 5:30 PM, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel because I was sitting in front of a screen that was ready to project what's been called one of the most controversial and brutal films ever made. I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion,\\" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed \\"Bravehart\\" and \\"The Man Without a Face,\\" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way thatpassion could never be conveyed. <br /> <br />Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as \\"The Natural\\" and \\"The Patriot.\\" To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.  <br /> <br />And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real. <br /> <br />As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people youput in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that. <br /> <br />Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \\"the passion\\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs. You will be moved by this great motion picture epic, I guarantee it. <br /> <br />Grade: A++ (first ever)  <br /> <br /> <br />-Rock Hogan <br />
0062502182|5.0|I have read lot of books which teachs us values. And lot of novels too. But this is a two-in-one. I like the way the author takes us through the story. It has lot of important lessons to life. When i read stories based on mythology i tend to get a bit sober. But this time i felt i was on cloud 9. A must read.
B0007PAMBK|5.0|Well I purchased this movie awhile back and didn't have a chance to view it until last night.....The movie was great and I watched it in its original format (B&W) because what is the point watching an \\"old\\" movie if you don't watch it the way people would've watched it back in 1962....now it isn't like our \\"newer/modern\\" horror movies....remember it was filmed back in '62. But I think the mood of the film was great...the spooky music was a major factor in the movie...the acting isn't the best and the plot is alittle shaky but overall a great cult classic so if you like horror movies and wish to explore the beginningsof horror movies....you should check out this movie!!
B00005JLWN|4.0|1984, The Matrix, Clockwork Orange; these movie are set in the future.<br /><br />Equilibrium is a movie about the future.<br /><br />Set after the third world war, the people in charge decide that the reason man has fallen is<br /><br />emotion. They create a drug called prozium, something we would relate to Prozac, or something that creates a calm euphoric state. Basicaly, no one knows true joy or hate, or has experienced any extreme emotion.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays a Grammaton Cleric, a defender against 'sense crimes'. The goverment employs an army of well armed guards, and the ultimate fighter, the cleric. We start off seeing two clerics raiding a sense offender hide out. Christian and his partner, Sean ? (who plays Boramir in Lord of The Rings, and 006 in Goldeneye), head in, and Christian shows us in one of my favorite cinematic techniques I've seen, The gun kata. More on that later. After the action scene, his partner asks why they have to be so cruel and heartless. This tips him off: He is a sense criminal.<br /><br />Later, he must face his partner. This tears him apart, but the affect of the prozium keeps him from feeling it, same as his wifes murder. One morning, he skips his dose. His son, who is training to be a cleric, notices. We assume he is an enemy to his very feeling, just like everyone else around him. So begins his journey to emotional fulfillment, or at least stability, in this world of no highs or lows. It's one of my favorites, and so is Bale, who is a really good actor.<br /><br />The picture quality is decent in most scenes, but in comparison to the cg, they look fuzzy like all good sci fi action adventures (namely the matrix... why does it always get compared there?). The sound is great, with sweeping orcheastral scores and techno beats, and the bizarre mix of both.<br /><br />The action is so amazing. With attention to all weapon styles, choreography, and visual effects the director has pieced together something cool and stylish. He mentions his influences in his commentary, everything from Christian holding his sword underhand like Zatoichi, and the Gun Kata being created as a response to movie where guns are in a seperate category from martial arts. So, now they ARE the martial art, and are influenced by all kinds of weapon arts. Fast paced, hardly cheesed or hollywood, all the actors are athletic in their own respects.<br /><br />For special effects, theres a featurette, that despite being a few minutes long covers all the asskissing and talking about the tough parts, and how they trained... You've seen it before. Next,<br /><br />there are two commentary tracks: one of the director, and one of him and the producer. The director's commentary is insighful into why he thought the movie didn't do so well, the parts he likes, he doesn't, budget problems, etc. The one with the producer is more about the script, how the film came together, and even more about techniques and budget solutions. I kind of like this, he no Rob Rodriguez or anything, but it's pretty cool to hear their opinions and all the little insights.<br /><br />There are a few trailers, but nothing too exciting. It kills me to not give it a five. But, overall, the story gets a 4, the quality a 4, but the disc gets a 2 1/2 for no originality or cool features, just a good commentary track(s). Overall, a solid 4, for a movie you'll love and maybe even come back to.stylish.

B000002UAF|5.0|this movie that goes with the disc,is basicly all about the beatles running from hoardes of crazy groupies.the title track is really good and a #1.\\"i shouldve known better\\" is 2nd and self explanetory about a chick.\\"if i fell\\" is a sad john song.its one of the best ones on the album.\\"im happy just to dance with you\\" is really  cool too.then theres the best song on the album,a very pretty \\"and i love her\\".then its \\"tell me why\\" about a guy trying to figure out a chick.good luck.\\"cant by me love\\" is about how money cant buy love.no,but itll get the boom boom booming!\\"ill cry instead\\" is depressing as you probobaly ascertained.the last 4 are good.they are \\"things we said today\\"[nolstalgic],\\"when i get home\\"-a wanna be a hard days night,\\"you cant do that\\" and lastly,\\"ill be back\\".its cool.
B00068NVI4|5.0|For those that are complaining about the sound, you need to learn how to adjust the sound settings on the DVD.  This is one of the best sounding and best produced concert DVD's I have seen to date.  Simply incredible!
0062515675|4.0|The best thing about this book is that it is very easy to read and that you don't want to put it down. <br />So I recommend it to everyone who is struggling with work, social life, family, everyday or is just going through a phase. <br /> <br />What's inside is nothing new, but reminds you about \\"the origin of  happiness\\" which we tend to forget in everyday life.  <br /> <br />It is very basic, not a piece of literature or art but exactly this makes it an easy read...certainly makes you feel good. <br /> <br />
B00003CXA6|4.0|This movie is very acurate but does drag in certain places. The director does a very fine job of re-creating the battles. I am a Civil War enthusiat but not all consumed by the war and found this movie to be worth my while. I recomend you play the directors comments at the end of the movie...very interesting.
B00029LNHS|5.0|While I own and apperciate hundreds of albums....Elephunk is one that I can listen to from start to end no matter what mood I'm in and it remains enjoyable and fresh as the first time.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Wow!  I bought this live DVD because I have tickets to see the Eagles in October, and wanted to \\"preview\\" the show.  Well, this may be the best live performance of the Eagles they've ever done.  I miss Don Felder, but the guy who replaces him is outstanding, and he carries forward the strong instrumentation that is so characteristic on Hotel California, as well as several other songs.  Joe Walsh, as a lead guitarist, just gets better all the time.  Maybe it is the absence of the booze?  But I really love his and all the band members' performance on Walsh's solo performance on One Day at a Time.  For all that the Eagles said in the late 70's about not wanting to be playing Take It Easy, and other Eagles standards when their members are 50+ years old, the band instead has developed a greater love of its own music, and plays and sings tighter than ever.  This is the best musical DVD I have ever purchased, and I have many.
B00005JNSK|5.0|BEST SONGS EVER! <br /> <br />WATCH THIS MOVIE OR I WILL HAUNT YOU! <br /> <br />I LIKE CHOCOLATE! AND I LIKE THIS MOVIE!  <br /> <br />IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE, THEREFORE, VICARIOUSLY, I DON'T LIKE THOSE THAT DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE! THE SQUIRRELS WILL ATTACK!
B00005JNTX|1.0|Love this movie!  A must see movie!  Hate these kinds of releases though.  I'm waiting for the Dec 2 disc release with all of the extras.  The only thing I'm happy about is that they told us another deluxe DVD was coming.  It doesn't make the wait any easier though.  I was anxiously awaiting this movie on DVD, but now I have to wait until December.  I guess I might rent the DVD so I can watch the movie again, but I'm tired of buying movies and then having a deluxe version coming out later.  Hellboy, Daredevil, X-men 1.5, etc...  We have to get the industry to stop this.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|This is just a ridiculously bad movie.  Strictly from an action point of view, they use tons of CGI and fancy editing to cover the fact that none of the actors can do any real stunt work.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|While I was watching the movie I remember praying for the time when the movie would end.  It was so slow and boring, but I kept thinking maybe it would get better. Besides I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I really didn't like this movie and I regret buying it.... but the movie is a great converstion started.  It sounds funny afterwards when you're talking to your friends about it, but otherwise, not at all.
B000002X2B|5.0|I got blows against the empire on vinyl probably through the fact that Jerry Garcia was on it.  <br /> <br />I just love this album. One of the reviewers above referred to this album being made at the same time as David Crosby's 'If only I can remember my name' album and there are similarities between the two in more than just personnel. <br /> <br />If you like the Dead and Airplane then you will most probably like this album. It's certainly not what most people associate with the later Starship records.  <br /> <br />Highlights for me are 'Lets go together' and the sublime 'Have you seen the stars tonite' which segues to 'Starship' via XM. Jerry's playing throughout is both beautiful and inventive, and should not be missed.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00000255F|5.0|The haunting first lines of \\"Thunder Road\\" say it all:<br /><br />The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves<br />Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays<br /><br />As a youngster I wasn't concerned with lyrics, I wanted songs to R-O-C-K.  This 'lil 'ol turn of words gave me pause..what a sublime picture it paints, enough for even a young, spermy metalhead to take pause.  Today, they still stand as maybe the best intro lyrics of all time.<br /><br />Oh, make no mistake, this album smokes in Springsteen's typical keyboard/sax driven style, but gosh, the lyrics.  Every song tells a story.  Every song rocks. Every song is memorable.  I just happen to think of \\"Thunder Road\\" as the best on the album, among the best 5 or so ever recorded.<br /><br />Get this album.  As other posters have made clear, it is among the very, very best ever done.  It will grow on you, until you know every word, every sax note, every guitar solo.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I feel like a lot of people don't like bands for all of the wrong reasons. \\"Oh no, this beat is kind of catchy, must be evil richy pop!\\" is a bad additude to have. Additionally, anything I reveiw is not going to be a washed up version of something else. Another thing I've noticed is most of the time someone who rates an album at one star, writes a mere sentance or two which is to the effect of: \\"This album sucked go buy punk/metal/indie/etc.\\" Rather than: \\"I didn't like this album because the lyrics were repetative and the guitar was lacking. Although some of the basslines were really fresh and funky, I found that the album overall was not worth the money I paid for it...\\" etc etc. <br /> <br />Okay, now to the album. This album is stunning. It blends a slightly 70's and 80's sound, with a bit of funk, rock and pop. Anyone who appreciates different types of music should enjoy some of this album. The songs Darts of Pleasure and Come On Home, get a little weak, but they can only be seen this way when compared to Franz's other songs. Even these songs stand out against more average songs. They take a little bit from many different bands, newer and older. They realy come together with something that is really thier own and great fun to listen to.
0385513755|5.0|when i first heard about this book i thought it was just for the entertainment of super intelligent geeks! After close inspection and many hours of in depth reading i was amazed to be wrong! At first glance i thought this is so not my kind of book but after just a few few pages i couldn't put the book down even if i tried, i was addicted to it, i bet if you try reading it then you will be too!
B00006BTCA|5.0|It upsets me that these days 9 people can get together and distort thier instruments beyond recognition and be called music gods, but when a few people get together and actually make some good music it's 1 star trash. I find Interpol to be a bit like Radiohead and a bit like The Killers. The sounds are pleasing, the lyrics are odd but enjoyable, and the voice is outstanding. The instruments are played with skill and a fair amount of uniqueness. <br /> <br /> <br />Not everyone will aprreciante this album. Of course, if I could just buy an extreem distortion pedal and scream a lot, I'm sure I would be loved by all.
B000002BUY|4.0|That's what I though when I first heard my friend describe this CD.  Hearing what I heard on the radio by Incubus made me mad that they would even TRY to imitate Mr. Bungle. But I actually gave this CD a chance...and boy did I make the right choice. I would have never thought that Incubus - a mainstream band - could've possibly pulled off an album like this. I was, err am, shocked. They actually made a decent CD where others have failed. See Slipknot. Horrible Nu-Metal band that try to imitate the Bungle. They wear the clown suits and everything. But they failed miserably in their first album to imitate Mr. Bungle.  <br /> <br />     But enough about that. About the album. It is mind-blowing. It grabs you and doesn't let go. It is infectiously catchy. It is simply phenomenal. The vocals are incredible, the drumming is incredible, the guitar work is incredible. That's all I need to say about it really. <br /> <br />     One thing still irks me though. Why did Incubus go the mainstream route? You can clearly hear in this album that they are extremely talented. They have so much potential to be one of the best modern bands, but they sacrificed good music for fame. It saddens me.  <br /> <br />     Now you're probably wondering why I gave this album only four stars. Well, it's actually 4.3 stars. I really can't give this album 5 stars as well as Mr. Bungle, because they are simply superior in every way. But I don't think any band will surpass them anyway. But this album has earned Incubus the right to hold a candle to Mr. Bungle, which in itself is a compliment. <br /> <br />Highlights of this album: Certain Shade of Green, Favorite Things, and Summer Romance. These are incredible. The rest are a mere fantastic. :P
B000001GBJ|5.0|Pure, enchanting music.  Any stress you have when you start this CD will be gone by the time the CD ends.
6305537321|2.0|Holly Golightly is no doubt adorable. What frustrates me is that the director and producers think that 2 hours of Holly acting cute counts as a movie. The plot is simple and doesn't make much sense: A young gold-digging Holly Golightly is obsessed with the idea of marrying a rich guy. She then takes her equally money-obsessed neighbor shoplifting and true love somehow instantly sprouts from there. This movie is not for me, but you might like it if you believe in \\"love at first sight\\" and have a thing for Holly's classic charm and silly but cute antics. <br /> <br />Another thing, the one and only Asian person in the movie was portrayed as a buck-teethed, rude, socially-retarded, and all-around pathetic loser. I am Asian myself and was deeply offended that Asians are stereotyped in this movie as being the stupid and ugly people of American society. The thought of the general public laughing at an immigrant's accent and lack of English skills is disturbing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Follow the yellow brick road once more only this time through the eyes of Elphabae, the \\"Wicked\\" Witch of the West and Glinda the good witch. If you have seen the musical or purchased the CD, then you'll know what I'm talking about when I say this music is suberb. Fall in love with the characters by just listening to this music. Songs such as \\"The Wizard and I\\", \\"Popular\\", \\"What is This Feeling\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\", and \\"For Good\\" will make you laugh, cry, and want to sing to the top of your lungs! So what are you waiting for? Buy this CD. You won't regret. It's absolutley Wicked!
B00005JKCH|4.0|I never expected this movie to be anywhere near as good as it was!  The special effects were phenomenal.  The story held my attention from beginning to end.  It was really surprising how great a job they did on this film.  I bought the DVD as soon as it came out!
B00068NVI4|2.0|I'm very dissapointed in this DVD. It's not that I've been waiting for it and this the result of the 'extra work' is worthless, it's just... <br /> <br />The production is decent, but seems quite weird. Jon's voice seems to stand out while I can barely hear the drums...and Alan isn't usually a quiet player. So, the mixing still needs work since the balance is oddly off. <br /> <br />The music selection. Am I the only one out there who thought they really didn't play any exciting songs? These DVDs are supposed to capture some of the emotion and fun of a concert, but there are some flaws here. Unfortunately these wonderful musicians are past their prime and while still technically excellent their stage presence is worse than a 4 year old in a sandbox. It doesn't feel fun, especially with Steve Howe standing as straight and serious as a totem pole. <br /> <br />They have put out a massive amount of incredible music over the past 35 years, but they should definitely end on this note, even though I never got to see them live.

It's fascinating, and sounds good to boot. <br /> <br />Bands like Green Day will sound so cheap and fake after you've heard this record. <br /> <br />It's kind of a cliche, but if you call yourself a rock music fan, you need this album, it's an \\"essential\\".

B0009I7NNA|5.0|While my friends say they are disappointed by this album given that it's not the A7X they know and love from Waking The Fallen and/or Sounding The Seventh Trumpet, but for me, this album is a real nice change. From the three songs I've heard (Beast and the Harlot, Burn it Down, and Bat Country), I can see that they are trying to be more of a metal band, and ultimately, they are succeeding in every aspect.<br /><br />Above all things, the lyrics aren't very much emo-style at all, and the guitars have more of a melodic metal feel to them. The thing that I like most: there are more solos! There was perhaps one solo on Waking The Fallen, and it was amazing! It really showed that screamo guitarists had great skill and didn't just have to stick to notes in the C-scale throughout each song (they're actually in drop D, but whatever). If you are expecting an album that is similar to Waking The Fallen, you will be disappointed. However, as true as it was that they are a great band as they were before, they sound a hell of a lot more metal now, and given the metal fanatic I am, this was real good for me.

0452282152|4.0|I read the book after seeing the movie and I truly believe that in order to understand the story you need to read the book. This story is so good because it has details and nuances that you only get from the book. Chevalier made me care about her leading lady, Griet. I felt for her and her hard life full of sadness. The book even made me feel downhearted after reading it, but I still enjoyed it. This is the book that led me to find out more about Vermeer and Chevalier and to check out more of her books in the library.

B000002HH2|5.0|It really amazes me what Bjrk does in her solo albums. You never really know what to expect if you don't follow things enough. And I'll admit, she's a real acquired taste and requires being in the \\"right\\" mood to listen to it. But when I'm in that \\"mood\\", the stuff is really amazing when I listen to it. And this album is just plain crazy for those. I haven't heard either of her Icelandic-language albums, but where \\"Debut\\" was more of a simple electronic record, \\"Post\\" is just all over the place. Don't worry; this is a good thing. Because it just makes the album tons of fun. <br /> <br />Things start out with the eccentric \\"Army of Me\\", one of my favorite songs by her ever. Her voice works well with the cool music. Then it proves to be a one-two punch whenever the outstanding \\"Hyperballad\\" follows. It is a classic example of what Bjrk does great when she does those avant-garde type songs. It is such a beautiful song. Then the lyrics on \\"Modern Things\\" are just plain brilliant, then the percussion just turns it into a better thing. It's just amazing what \\"Post\\" delivers in. <br /> <br />You get things in the opposite side of the spectrum. Sounding like a track from a musical, the remake of \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" is quite fun. Then there's the mellow, near-baroque influence on \\"You've Been Flirting Again\\". \\"Headphones\\" also ends this album on a nice note. <br /> <br />This album is very haphazardous, but that's kind of what makes it fun. Because of this, some people find it hard to consume the album as a whole. But it is just one of many reasons why people listen to her in the first place. Several songs on here are considered Bjrk classics and it's an album that you'll find yourself listening to time and time again. She matched this brilliance on the follow-up album, \\"Homogenic\\". Exciting, new ground, good lyrics, there's just nothing not to love about \\"Post\\".
6304698682|4.0|In \\"Pale Rider\\", Clint Eastwood has taken the classic 1953 Alan Ladd movie \\"Shane\\" and turned it into a \\"modern\\" sexualized version.  There is no mistaking the sexual tension in this film. Clint plays the mysterious \\"Preacher\\" (a character the antithesis of sex,), who comes to a mining settlement to rescue persecuted settlers who are a target for a larger mining interest.  Eastwood's \\"Preacher\\" creates sexual tension with both female leads, the widow Carrie Snodgrass and her duaghter Megan, played by the beautiful Sydney Penny (the memorable \\"Meggie\\" in \\"The Thorn Birds\\").  Due to previous trauma, the widow has a dead love life and her interest in a new love is reborn with the arrival of Eastwood.  Megan, a precocious child of 14 is ready to give her young love to the answer to her prayers, the Preacher.<br /><br />\\"Pale Rider\\" is Eastwood's first western since \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\", 9 years earlier.  In the mid-1980's, the western genre was considered \\"dead\\" in Hollywood with little public interest, but the success of this movie resurrected the western, and led to several more movies and made-for TV movies with old west themes (Silverado).  Eastwood would make one more western, \\"Unforgiven\\" (1993), which Hollywood critics would heap praise on and award with several Academy Awards.<br /><br />Eastwood resurrects another character in this movie, that of the mysterious stranger in \\"High Plains Drifter\\", who comes out of the past to exact revenge on a town that abandoned him when he was sherrif.  His \\"Preacher\\" in \\"High Plains Drifter\\", has a clouded past as well, and throughout the film, there are hints given that the Preacher is perhaps a man back from the dead to repay past atrocities.<br /><br />The showdown in town between Eastwood and the evil gang of killers is renimicient of the final scene in \\"Shane\\", where Alan Ladd goes to town to face down the evil Mr. Wilson and his gang of gunmen.  Eastwood's Preacher faces down his former tormenters one by one until he finally faces the man who he once met in his dark past, the man who once put 6 shots in tight pattern in his back.  As th film ends, Megan also appears much like \\"Little Joe\\" did in \\"Shane\\", but not to beg him to come back, but to tell him thank you and say her last loving goodbye.  The Preacher, his past atoned, rides off into the cold snowy mountains, his job finished.<br /><br />It is a very entertaining movie, but one that is not fit for the entire family.  Younger children should not be allowed to view the close up shooting scenes where good and bad alike are shot through the forehead and other places.  The gruesome violence is not toned down, typical Eastwood film technique.  I'd recommend that children under 12 not be allowed to see the film due to the violence.  Adults and western film fans will find the movie entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Pale Rider\\" does not match \\"Shane\\" in terms of its classic movie status.  \\"Shane\\" is a much better movie, but \\"Pale Rider\\" is still one of Eastwood's better received films, receiving warm praise from critics and fans alike.<br /><br />For the Eastwood film fan, you will want to have this one for your collection.ne until he finally faces the man who he once met in his dark past, the man who once put 6 shots in tight pattern in his back.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Musically speaking this a great consistent album.  Almost all songs are very good and the performance in pure coldplay style is excellent.  <br />If you like the 2 previous Coldplay albums this WILL NOT dissapoint you at all. Now if you are looking for deeper things, such as new sounds, mind-blowing lyrics, spirituality,  etc, etc. you won't find it here.  If you are looking for powerful, easy listening cool songs, this is GREAT STUFF. <br />My favourites:  White Shadows, Talk, X&Y, The Hardest Part.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I have to confess I came at this movie thinking I'll just get through it. When I think of musicals I conjure up images of when I was a bored youngster suffering through the silly singing parts of a film. I'm sure maturity helped but this is one outstanding musical. The music itself is orchestrated perfectly with a irresistable sound. The singing which has a raw \\"one take\\" sound to it, grabs you. I have never liked Richard Gere much, but he does well. Catherine Zeta Jones and Michelle Zellweger are on target in every way. The sets and the story that a bad deed can catapult you to fame are originally done. Putting this kind of musical to film(clownish 20s era song fest)could easily have flopped. Very entertaining. I didn't give it 5 stars because of some dippy parts and I really still don't like musicals.
B00005NTN5|1.0|People (mostly guys) think this movie is great because it' centers around two lesbs.  They think the romance seen is great because of the lesbs.  Yet, people who watched Alexander were so afended because of the homesexual innuendos, so they gave the movie very low socres.  This movie is a trash hands down! The only thing good about this movie was the mafia scene and that's it.  By the way, if peple can accept two females having sex on the screen, then they should accept the movie Alexander's homosexual scenes!
0553212443|5.0|My class have to read some external readings and I choosed this one. With a Christmas-atmosphere title and its author, Charles Dickens-- the most talented one, this book is very attractive. It grows a wonder why does the title sound like a Chirstmas song. <br /> <br />Then, I read it and found that this book is great! It told about 'the grasping, covetous old man', Mr. Scrooge, who hated the Chirstmas feasta (and so do the other festivals, I think.) Then he was visited by the 3 ghosts of Chirstmas who recalled his complete-forgotten joyful of this feasta in his younghood and revived his Chirstmas spirit that had changed him to become the great-hearted one! <br /> <br />My fevorite charactors are 'Tiny Tim' and Mr. Fezziwig who has a grateful mind. There are many life lessons still waiting for you to found them. Just try!! <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I always enjoyed the story of Troy, so I decided to watch the movie Troy when it came out.  After watching the movie, I was very suprised by how the movie was put together.  Now, I know that Brad Pitt is a big star, but he did not have to be the focus point of this whole movie.  I saw more of Pitt in the movie scenes then the kings or princes on both sides.  I also didn't see how this girl prisoner would be so angry with him and then turn around sleep with him so quickly.  I just wish that the movie would focus more equally on other important characters and not so much on Brad Pitt.  I also didn't understand why he pranced around naked so much in the movie, just what does that supposed to do for the story?  However, I could sit through this movie a little easier then the movie Alexander which I gave one star rating to because it was so boring.  That said, here are things I actually liked about the movie: 1. the story line itself, how Pitt showed his cousine how to fight, and then later cousine dies 2. chararacters who played emperors and their sons on both side did very good job with acting 3. the fire balls that were used at night to attact the Trojans. 4.  the trojan horse looked very authentic.  It is definately worth seeing!

B000006NUW|5.0|The digital age was with us at least a decade before this collection hit the streets and, although other Motown collections have followed, it's still the best around. In the 1960's, monophonic AM radio was king and the era's luminaries concentrated on making their mono mixes as exciting as possible. Stereo mixes were an afterthought, done quickly, and often left to production assistants. Still, until this collection came around, the only Motown available were the inferior stereo mixes, not the ground-shaking mono monsters that exploded from radios worldwide during the 60's. From the massive basslines of James Jamerson, the thrilling arrangements of Holland-Dozier-Holland and others, to the exciting vocals of the Four Tops, the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, and others, this collection nails it! The \\"Sound of Young America\\" has never sounded better. <br />
B00005JNTX|2.0|If you are a comic/graphic novel fan then this story is one of the most talked about over the years and you'll appreciate the creativity of the makers in bringing this gritty story to the screen. For the simple fact that it is based on a &#34;comic&#34;, many will love it regardless of the content.<br /><br />For those who aren't fans of comics, I'd wager that there will be a greater chance of not liking this at all for the simple fact that it is based on a comic and it is shown with a constant meld of animation and live action which may turn many off.<br /><br />My initial feelings of this movie are like those of Pulp Fiction. . .a linking of short stories that left the viewers torn between one camp who loved it and one who hated it.<br /><br />As with Pulp Fiction I'm one of the few who is in the middle ground or closer to not liking the movie.<br /><br />1) The movie is beautiful and creative. The black & white animation melded with live action and the single splashes of color were eye catching<br /><br />2) WARNING: If you are offended by EXTREME graphic violence and some nudity then this movie is not for you and some parents may consider watching it before letting their teenagers view it due the trademark Tarantino adult content. Unlike Kill Bill where the violence was just a joke that it moved from gross to ignoring it, this movie was violent for shock value I thought.<br /><br />3) The best part of the movie is Marv! Nuff said.<br /><br />4) If you favor one contiguous story with one main protagonist and one main antagonist then you might not like this. Like I said, this is a handful of short stories that are linked by Sin City as the setting<br /><br />5) If you like &#34;happy&#34; endings then you might not appreciate on some levels the story resolutions that take place. This is not a happy movie but one where courage and purpose in life can show up even in the most desperate and dark places.<br /><br />OVERALL:  it was an intriguing movie to watch though I felt dirty afterward on different levels. In Tarantino's fashion, he always exploits the dark side of people with a glimmer of heroism thrown in. Simply because it is &#34;new&#34; is not a good reason to watch something. . .this is one I'd lean more in the end to wishing I had not exposed myself to.I felt dirty afterward on different levels.

B00023B1LC|2.0|I've been a fan of the Ludlum novels for a long time, and have read them and re-read them several times.  It was always great fun to wait for the newest editions of the Jason Bourne/David Webb series.  I'm also a great fan of Matt Damon, and think he will go on to make many more wnderful movies. <br /> <br />Okay, here's the \\"but...\\" part of this review... <br /> <br />In the novels, and please correct me if I'm wrong, Jason Bourne/David Webb was an older man...in the final two, he was at least in his 40's, and his wife remained alive...the wife he picked up after the first Bourne novel.  She was a genius in economics and world banking if I recall.  The fact of his age played a great part in the novels.  He was also a man who had been altered to have facial features that didn't attract attention, and his disguises were simply done with a change of hair color, eye color, etc.  In the Damon version, you have Matt Damon, who always looks like Matt Damon, and he is more quick at just moving about and away, rather than blending, as the character in the novel relied more on the blend.  Jason Bourne/David Webb, as written, was a middle aged man, and that age also added to experience.  With Matt Damon, you're still looking at a high-tech \\"kid\\".  The Damon movies are good, and certainly packed with action, but they hardly follow the books at all.  An avid reader of Ludlum merely ends up going \\"huh?\\"  The Damon movies are good, if you want an action-packed adventure that has very little to do with the character...and the Carlos figure in the \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" is almost non-existant, if not utterly confused.  If you avoid reading the books, and only watch the Damon movies, it's a nice enough romp.  If you have read the books, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br />The 1988 made-for-television movie with Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith is highly superior, though a little harder to find.  It's true to the novel,  and doesn't have to rely on the new technological, scene-skating imagery of the Damon films.  It's sad that they didn't carry the Chamberlain film into the latter books, as \\"The Bourne Identity\\" done by this film was extremely well-done, and actually followed the plot line of the Ludlum novels.  Were Ludlum alive, I don't think he'd approve much of what Damon has done. <br /> <br />Instead of buying the current Damon versions, invest your money in the Chamberlain version, and then you can decide. <br /> <br />Matt Damon, again, will go on to do great things, he's very talented, but he was wrong for this part.  Perhaps if they had not titled them after the Jason Bourne series, they would just stand as good movies.  They're not bad to watch, but have very little to do with the novels. <br /> <br />Donn Kean
0812550706|5.0|I have read a lot of science-fiction stories but Ender's Game was the most exciting science-fiction story I've ever read. In Orson Scott Card's introduction to the edition I read, he talked about the importance of the reader connecting with the characters and the characters sounding real. I found that he was very successful at doing this.  <br /> <br /> It's important to have characters that one can relate to. You would think Ender would get a little cocky about winning all his battles and challenges, but he doesn't. Usually when someone is better than somebody else they might start bragging and taunting, a bad way to behave. Ender is the total opposite; he demonstrates good sportsmanship. Like him, I show good sportsmanship in my basketball games whether I win or lose. <br /> <br />Ender is also a very friendly guy. He understands his higher-ranking position, yet he still cares about his friends. This connects to me. I'm going to a different school than some of my friends, but I will still care about the ones at the other school.  <br />  <br /> The battles Ender has against other armies are also realistic. They're just like laser tag, paintball, or computer games, things I like to do with my friends. When using the guns in those games, it's just like blasting your enemies. In Ender's Game there were two teams shooting each other and it seemed so similar to the paintball games I've played. <br />  <br /> I would definitely say that Ender sounds real and is someone I can relate to, and other readers will react the same way.
1400032717|4.0|This book was chosen by the members of my book club because we found it relevant reading for our age group because of the main characters age. <br />The protagonist Christopher Boone is a fifteen year old autistic boy. When he finds his neighbor's dog murdered one night he decides to write a novel about his adventure to investigate the murder. Mrs. Shears' dog Wellington was stabbed with a pitchfork in the middle of the night. Along with investigating the crime scene personally Christopher gathers information from all the neighbors and uses his savant math skills to problem solve the mystery. His school teacher Siobhan helps him to write the novel and learn to cope with his world increasingly better as he takes risks by talking to new people and interacting with them.  <br />His investigations lead him to find some letters that had been addressed to him in his father's room. Hid father had told him for the past two years that his mother was dead, but upon reading these letters he discovers that this mother had written to him every week since the time of her \\"death.\\"  <br />I think the book club made an excellent choice. This book really enlightened me on a subject I previously knew little about. Autism is a very difficult thing to life with in modern society. I could see how stressed Christopher became when he was in the subway station. All of the things he noticed overwhelmed his very slow processing brain and made him feel backed up. He said that he sees too much, which distracts him. I can relate to this personally because one of my biggest personal traits is perception. I notice lots of small details and things in my periphery that also distract me very often. It was interesting to see the tactics he used to deal with the world around him. I feel confident now that if I met an autistic person I would not be nervous, because I would have a much better sense of what their going through. <br />The book itself is written through Christopher point of view, in fact itis his detective novel. His thoughts are the only ones that appear to the reader, bringing them into his world. Mark Haddon did a lot of research on autism and I think he got it on to paper as a novel quite well. I think if everyone read this book it could only be that much better for autistic people who are trying to interact with us.    <br />
B00005JNDZ|1.0|Everything Bridget learned, grew, appreciated and worked towards in the first film is undone by the calculated stupidity and unfunny blunderings committed in this sequel. It seems that the only time Bridget can be a happy, self-confident woman is when she's on the borderline of misery and happiness. Once happy, she struggles to undo everything she might have done right.<br /><br />Hugh Grant's character is a sleazy, but fun cad and he plays Daniel allowing us to enjoy him while at the same time showing his appalling self-involvement. However, abandoning Bridget when she's caught at the Thai airport was a stretch and out of character, even for a narcissist. Just because a man's a skirt-chasing, flirtatious louse doesn't mean he needs to be portrayed as an intolerant oaf.<br /><br />Also, in the first film, Renee was filmed beautifully. Her skin was glowing and even in her granny panties she looked kittenishly sexy. In this film, the director aims certain shots to make every crease in her skin, every fold of flesh and every little wrinkle stand out and frame Bridget as a silly, flabby fatty which, even with the extra pounds, she is not.  Why was it necessary to show her in negative situations in the worst negative light?<br /><br />The movie and the character might have resonated had she not been  directed and shown in such a ridiculous manner.  As it was, it was dreadful.

0451169514|3.0|...granted, I read it when I was supposed to be hard at work at a summer job, but 1000+ pages is an awful lot of book, and an awful lot of time to sink into a mediocre one.  <br /> <br />Maybe I was just spoiled by the much more compelling (and much more tightly edited) film version. Even that seemed more cheesy/silly than scary, (as my little sister pointed out when we saw it together... and she was 10 at the time).  <br /> <br />More to the point, the character of Bill Denborough is most clearly and certainly a Mary Sue... and a particularly obnoxious one, at that. This was made most clear by the vingette in the university, when the reader is made privy to what I can only assume to be a \\"Stephen King autobiographical experience\\" : Bill/King writes a story, receives an \\"F\\", and nevertheless submits it to a pulp magazine, launching himself into a successful career as a horror-fiction writer.  <br /> <br />Also, everyone inexplicably loves him, he has an endearing personal defect (a stutter), he's the Fearless Leader, and he Gets the Girl. At the end, I wanted Pennywise to just eat his face.  <br /> <br />Meh. Maybe The Stand will be better.
0394800184|5.0|My daughter who is now five years old, still asks me to read this book. What a wonderful adventure for a young mind to explore. I can't think of a message that is more precious.

B00005ASHM|5.0|\\"Pet Sounds\\" seems to be compared a lot on this website to \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", which might be okay since The Beatles were so impressed with The Beach Boys new (at that time) album, but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous. Both are legendary albums in different ways, and \\"Pet Sounds\\" for a moment in time made the Beach Boys the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world, even bigger than there friendly competitors The Beatles (who came right back and took the title away from them with \\"Revolver\\"). <br /> <br />First off, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a far, far departure from the Beach Boys that most people know and love. These songs aren't about fun in the sun, girls, and surfing. Instead, it is a deep examination of the thoughts and dreams of a young boy, and how they change as he grows older and his problems and worries become bigger issues for him to deal with. Many people know that Brian Wilson, the leader of the band and the creator of this album, had many mental problems, and also had various drug addictions at this time as well, so he had a thousand ideas that he was thinking about. Also, Brian was an obsessed perfectionist, he wanted to create an album that was greater than anything that had come out before. He spent hours upon hours in the studio, creating layers upon layers of sound and vocals, using any instrument available (even soda cans!) He created a sound that was more lush and beautiful than anything ever before, creating almost a \\"dream\\" sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life was yearning for the love and affection that he felt was missing. <br /> <br />\\"Pet Sounds\\" is Brian Wilson's baby, and many even argue that this was his solo debut as a back up band was used on many of the songs instead of his fellow band mates. However, the harmonies and vocals are what make this so pleasing, and only his band mates could help in that. The songs themself are pretty excellent. \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\", \\"Sloop John B.\\", and \\"God Only Knows\\" are the well known songs, and the only ones that you are able to listen to as singles. The other songs you have to listen to along with the album as they paint the whole picture that way. The album is about one man's search for love from boyhood to manhood, and the pain and hurt he goes through in his search for it. If Wilson's lyrics don't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain, then listen again. And again. And see how the album will move you in ways your never felt possible. <br /> <br />Such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fans collection. While this album might have started the break down of Brian Wilson, and while the rest of the band mates didn't necessarily agree with the direction the music was heading in (more songs influenced by drugs and mental illness, which the band wasn't dead set on singing the lyrics to), for one moment this album made them kings. Brian was working on his next project, \\"Smile\\", when The Beatles released \\"Sgt. Peppers.\\" After listening to it, Wilson put up his white flag of surrender, the others went back to the simple days of surf rock, and the Beach Boys never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness as they did with \\"Pet Sounds.\\"
B000002J1S|5.0|Most great art is misunderstood to some extent, and anyone (other than perhaps Peter Gabriel) who claims to fully understand this epic masterpiece (essentially the tale of a schizophrenic man's mythological journey in NYC) is either lying or has a quadruple doctorate in abstract post postmodern deconstructionist linguism. Which is not to say that it's impossible to follow. Just unlikely to fully decipher. Which makes it all the more fun to listen to hundreds of times. Each time feels like a discovery of sorts. The challenging quality of Peter Gabriel's semi-cryptic wordplay, coupled with some of Genesis' most profoundly sweeping and elaborate music ensure that this will remain an enduring classic for generations to come. Not easy to wrap one's mind around at first, but ultimately an addictive collection of well-woven ditties indeed. Those who are familiar with the songs but feel dissatisfied with the sound quality of Phil Collins' masterful drum work on this recording should pick up the suprisingly even more remarkable live version which is contained in its entirety on the first two discs of the Genesis Archive 1967-1975 box set. (Please note that while Gabriel's vocals are a bit better overall on the studio version, the music itself sounds even more dumbfoundingly impressive in the live version, and is well-worth picking up.) I attempted to see The Musical Box (who are licensed by Genesis to perform this work in its entirety, recreating every facet of the equally confounding stage show) perform this in Atlantic City, but a series of unfortunate mishaps (not the least of which was my car bursting into flames at the road's edge thirteen miles from the venue) prevented me from getting there until the show was over. But at least I've got the CDs to listen to countless times. A final note for conspiracy theorists... The main character of Peter Gabriel's story is \\"Rael\\". There's a cult called The Raelians who believe that extraterrestrials have been cloning humans. Dollythe sheep was the first known clone on earth. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Coincidence, or is Peter Gabriel an alien clone?
B000002JR8|1.0|This is one of the worst groups I've ever heard. I just recently \\"acquired\\" all of their CDs and gave them the benefit of the doubt, thinking their popularity would win them over. Unfortunately, their popularity only proves how many retards are in this world. <br /> <br />I just don't get it. I'm sick of these metal bands that play two guitar chords and have the singer growl for an hour. Oh my..metal masterpiece! Right. You want metal? Try \\"Kill 'Em All\\" by Metallica, \\"Peace Sells\\" by Megadeth, Danzig's early albums, Ozzy era Black Sabbath, and Nightwish. THAT's metal, not this festering pile of s***. <br /> <br />I've listened to all of their albums, and all I remember thinking while listening was \\"I want my 2 hours back\\". The vocalist is a absolute joke; trying hard to sound rough and raw but comes off sounding fake and uninspired. \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell is one of the most overrated guitarists I've even heard. Legendary metal guitarist, my foot. Commenting song by song would be a waste of time, because they all sound like a train wreck. <br /> <br />I'm actually glad \\"Dimebag\\" met his demise, because it means one less horrible band making more horrible albums. My favorite part of the Pantera listening experience was dragging all their songs to the recycle bin and clicking \\"empty recycle bin\\". <br /> <br />Pantera sucks. Too bad Amazon doesn't have a 0 star rating.
B0007GADZO|4.0|Steve,<br /><br />You have not out-done yourself, but you have certainly out-done the current crop of top-40 yahoo's who inhabit the airwaves.<br /><br />Thank you for doing what you do.<br /><br />Sparky<br /><br />PS Re; Track 07. The symphonic schmaltz we can do without.<br /><br />What the heck was that all about?
B000A59PMO|5.0|Wake up america and tune in! Great news that the DVD set will be out soon to feed the current dedicated fans addiction and rope in newcomers. Others have gone into greater detail about the wonders of this show- but it bears repeating that it truly is an amazing and highly addictive mystery noir teen angst melange- anchored by writing intelligent and witty enough to transport one back to both the glory days of hollywood screwball comedy and film noir. <br />Bravo to the standout characterizations/acting of Veronica Mars herself- star Kristen Bell, her savvy and funny dad Keith played by Enrico Colantoni and the beautiful sad mess Logan played by Jason Dohring.
B00005JL0I|1.0|This alleged spoof of Bond films is outright stuporous.  Absolutely nothing works here.  I found my attention waning while watching this film and having to pinch myself to stay awake.  I think I drew blood.  There are wall-to-wall \\"gags\\" here and none of them are funny.  It took five count 'em five directors and three screenwriters to concoct this abomination and it shows.  There is no fluency in the direction and the story is downright incoherent.  The film's few saving graces is that David Niven and Peter Sellers escape with their reputations intact.  There's a pretty good Bacharach-David score here but too bad it's not in the service of a better picture.  Ian Fleming must be rolling in his grave.
B000002HEP|4.0|Having no other Kyuss CDs I was going in to this one with no idea what to expect. I must say I was very surprised and pleased with the Heavy, Grungy sound on this record. The vocals take a backseat to thundering guitars and complex, ever changing riffs. <br />I like the extended jam sound of the songs, building off simple riffs to intense layered riffs that take your mind on a trip. <br />I gave this a four because although I really enjoy listening to it, I rarely do.
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you read the books, watched the movie in the theater, and are generally a Tolkien fan you will love this extended edition. Its incredible the amount of time that went into making all the movies. Seeing it all documented makes you appreciate it all the more. Now I know that Peter Jackson did not follow the The Two Towers exactly, namely with Aragorn and his assumed lover, but I think that it was done very well and detracks nothing from the movie at all. In fact I think it adds quite abit. Peter Jackson and the cast and crew were incredible. This extended DVD edition just shows you how incredible they really are. It was a awsome book , wonderful movie, and this is a great dvd. You need.

006054094X|2.0|While it is true that the Ming treasure fleets sailed extensively, and could conceivably have reached Australia or the Americas, Menzies certainly doesn't prove it.  Others here have picked apart the inconsistencies and just plain falsehoods in \\"1421\\" better than I could.    But as fiction, it's a pretty darn entertaining read (4 stars, maybe).    To other reviewers: 1) No, not everyone criticizing the book's scholarship is \\"racist.\\"  I, for one, would be quite intrigued if it were true, and did initially find it plausible, before I went fact-checking.  Notice also the several reviews by Chinese readers who found the book poorly researched. 2) Quit being so China- and Eurocentric, respectively.  No culture is perfect.  3) The prevalence of \\"Well, circumstantial evidence and outright lies are okay, because he writes convincingly and has an interesting idea\\" makes me weep for the quality of education in our society.
0345440900|5.0|Patrick is our first child and when he was only five weeks old, I found myself and his father being very tired and frustrated because we were not able to \\"figure out his paterns.\\"  A friend told me to read this book and I bought it that day.  My husband and I read it and all of a sudden, Patrick made sense to us. This book truly is the real thing for understanding your baby's patterns and what is happening and the patterns only become more and more distinct.  This book lays out very easily for a new mom and teaches you the EASY plan.  It works and saves everyone from being frustrated again.  I've run into so many new moms that think each time their newborn is fussy, it's because they are hungry, NOT TRUE.  This book tells you about that and helps you figure out which stage of the routine the newborn is in at that point.  This book was the answer for us and now we have one of the happiest babies and most alert newborns we've seen yet and he's only 10 weeks old now.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Despite the spotlight reviewer's claim, I believe Gandhi would indeed be pleased with this film.  What this movie does is draw attention to the plight of India under colonial rule and the struggle to overcome it.  Gandhi would not be so vain as to care about who got what credits and which image was used to sell a commercial product.  Isn't it what is inside that counts and not the surface things?  I feel bad for the reviewer for that person learned nothing from this movie and was just trying to find everything that might be flawed.  I am certain that Gandhi would have tried to find everything that was right.    This movie was made in both English and Hindi.  It is distributed within India in Hindi as well it should be.  It is distributed in English and other languages outside of India to get to as wide as audience as possible.  I very much doubt if people would have watched this had it been made only in Hindi and subtitled in English.    This movie does a great job of tracing Ghandi's life as he emerged from trying to lead a comfortable life as a lawyer to an uncomfortable life as the father of a nation.  You will also witness the politics and hostilities that were a part of this struggle in India.  One will truly appreciate the power of aggressive peaceful civil resistance which Gandhi employed so effectively.  It also dispels the myth that he employed passive resistance which he is often miscredited for.
B000024D4R|5.0|After the Pink  Floyd blew up  into mega-stars, following the astounding sucess of both Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, there was a bit of a backlash, at least in the UK, where were they were dimissed by youngsters and punks as \\"dinosaurs.\\" The infamous photo of John \\"Rotten\\" Lydon with his \\"I HATE Pink Floyd\\" tee shirt was in every tabloid at the time. But I'd put a Dollar to their Pound any day to bet that this is the Floyd at it's most hateful, most vitriolic, most bitter and nasty -their reaction to ( and reaction against ) the \\"punk\\" movement. The lyrics are mostly purely cynical, something they'd never done. The music rocks like they'd not done since their debut Piper at the Gates of Dawn. The guitar solos, courtesy of the genius Dave Gilmour, tear out of the speakers, especially on the remastered edition. Sure, there are moments of the trademark Floyd sound, particularly in the opening and closing acoustic  tracks, and in the extended spacey middle section of \\"Dogs\\". What remains is pure vile, and it is  all the better for it. Roger Waters' lyrics are a condemnation of all mankind, either as blind followers ( \\"Sheep\\"  which happens to feature Gilmour's best guitar solo, in  the outro ), as corrupt money-hungry savages ( \\"Dogs\\" ) or as self-righteous and hypocritical political leaders ( the quite funky \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\". This is a terrific album, one I go back to again and again. The music's on spot. The lyrics bite like no other Floyd album. And despite the fact that there are only really four songs on this album, it has a musical variety that is missing from some of their other albums. A keeper. Five stars, absolutely.
B00009AOBI|5.0|SPOILERS <br /> <br />I watch this on tv when it comes on now and then... <br />Sort of sad yet inspirational as others reviewers have said... <br />Rocky Dennis played by Eric Stoltz has a messed up face-- <br />or \\"lionitis\\"...he overcomes mocking and teasing by believing in himself, and not taking no crap from anyone.. he's part of a motorcycle gang--more like Cher who plays his mother is... <br />Rocky meets a blond blind girl who \\"sees\\" Rock for who <br />he really is.... <br /> <br />One scene is cool though...as Rocky is walking by in the  <br />school hallway- he overhears another guy bad mouthing him!! <br />So Rocky walks up to him, and slams him against the locker <br />saying, \\"I'll take off my mask if you take yours off <br />you son of a ___ \\"!!!  I don't blame him.... <br /> <br />How the make up for Rocky was done I have no clue, <br />but it's amazing...!! The only part of Erik Stoltz  <br />we can see in the movie of his real face is his eyes... <br /> <br />Feel good movie!!
