B001ZG4J00|5.0|Amazing 2nd album from Rodriguez...dynamic artist who had not received his due recognition.  This artist only has 2 albums and this is a must buy.  Do not pirate his stuff.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing story line. Many twists and turns that are unexpected! Hard to put the book down once you start reading!
B006O6F4O6|5.0|My son really loves this toy. He plays with it a lot. It seems to be durable and well made. Thumbs up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really liked it.  Was easy to use and helped my balance my check book.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B003KIMOIK|4.0|Laughed until my sides hurt the first time I saw this movie..can't wait to get my order..a few more days
0345803485|5.0|I am not an avid reader. It takes a lot for a book to keep my attention, let alone keep me up all night as I generally read to help me fall asleep. Let me tell you, I lost many nights of sleep over this trilogy and have read it 4 times now! I didn't even sleep at all one night just to finish the last book! It was worth it, though! The initial book was very hard for me to get through simply because of the BDSM whippings, which played way too much on my emotions and was too much for me to handle emotionally. When the book was over, I was left wanting more. I am so glad that I stuck with the series and in the end I fell in love with Christian and as I mentioned before, started the series over 3 more times!<br />I generally always purchase my books through Amazon, but I couldn't wait to read the next book and had to race out to Barnes & Noble to get my hot hands on the next book! I am not sure why so many people comment on this being poorly written. Other than some of the British jargon that I didn't find appealing, I feel that this author did an out of this world job writing this book series! I have read the \\"Bared to You\\" books, which are very similar and written by a seasoned author and I actually felt that 50 Shades had much more character development and plot to the story. So far, I haven't found another series of books that have played on my emotions as much as these. I LOVED Twilight and I have to say that this was even better. There are so many specific details in this story that come out in your everyday life that you will find yourself constantly thinking about the characters! The author is very detailed on the cars that they drive in the book, foods that are eaten and other little details that just wouldn't let me get this story out of my head. In my opinion, that is the sign of a good book!
B005SVVANW|5.0|This was a gift for my Pink Floyd, puzzle loving wife so it's only proper I get stuck with the review. I'm beggining to wonder if I should just shop at the mall and not get pestered for a written review of every little item I buy (required plus the number of words are counted?)
0425263908|5.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey, several of my co-workers recommended the Bared to You books. I wasn't sure I wanted to try them as others had tried to get me into other vampire books after the Twilight series and nothing could really compare to what I felt with Twilight. I just couldn't get into the True Blood books, although I did read the first 4 of the series and really tried to like them. I am glad that I opened these books. They are very similar to 50 Shades of Grey, but I don't feel there is as much character development or plot to these. That being said, it is a great series so far and I have been placed under the spell of waiting for the next one to be released to see what happens. This series gets on my nerves a little bit as they break up just about every day, so I am starting to get a little frustrated with Eva and annoyed with some of the stupid things that she does. There just isn't as much love story and plot to this series as there is in 50 Shades, but it still will give you that erotica fix that 50 Shades of Grey does extremely well! If you are looking for something that comes close to 50 Shades, I recommend this, but in my opinion, nothing compares to 50 Shades!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love Mark Twain and the adventures of Tom Sawyer takes me back to childhood and reminds me why I like to read children's books so much. His plucky, natural feeling characters are a joy and Tom is just smart enough to be interesting (like his ways of inventing new pretend games based on adventures he's read about), but just naive and superstitious enough to make him entertaining (curing warts with dead cats in graveyards). Way better than the movie.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|got the package on 04-02-13 1week before estimated time of arrival, was really happy and now i have all my favorite Kelly Clarkson hits on one cd!!!!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Re-reading it now. A good balance between superfluous writing and practical observation of women in that era. I enjoy Little Women both for the natural and whimsical natures of the girls and have always been a fan of their funny personalities, especially Jo and Amy. Highly recommended.
0385736002|5.0|Enjoyed it with my family and friends, all my cousins loved borrowing it to read over and over again and so do I
B0084AZXKK|3.0|This is a classic, no doubt, but it doesn't stand the test of time so well as others. The language is not always easy to understand and some of the sailing references are lost on me, though I get the gist of it. A good enough story for anyone willing to give it a try, but you might be better off watching the movies if you're not much into history or don't have an understanding of the era in which it was written.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is totally cool glu mobile inc always has great games so keep it up and I. am always going to be a big fan!!!!!
B0083Z614S|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. Mary was at times so imperfect and miserable I felt like wasn't reading about the right person, but I enjoyed it all the more for her faults. Her subtle improvements as the story went on were realistic and the magical descriptions of the garden reminded me of the movie and made me want to see it again. The only gripe I had with the story was how the focus transitioned from her to her cousin and he seemed to become the main character by the end of the book. It was a little confusing, to be honest, but I enjoyed it all the same and would recommend it to others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun its like your training a real horse! you get to fed them and pet them and ride them and put them in compotions.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is awesome cause you save animals but I don't like tat when you feed them they run away sometimes that's the part I don't like
0385536828|2.0|McEwan is one of my favorite authors, but this book was a disappointment. I wondered if he dredged up all of his rejected short stories and worked them into this book. He self summarizes his own book best when he writes,<br /><br />\\"I threw down my pen with a shout and stood up suddenly, knocking over the chair behind me. It was dull, it was dead. I'd covered forty pages, as easily as counting. No resistance or difficulty or spring, no surprises, nothing rich or strange. No hum, no torque. Instead, everything I saw and heard and said and did was lined up like beans in a row. It wasn't mere clumsy surface ineptitude. Buried deep in the concept was a flaw, and even that word sounded too good for what it was trying to name. It simply wasn't interesting.\\" (p. 308/Loc.4491-4494).
B002PEP4QY|1.0|kindle version only contained half of the book then stopped. not sure how to get resend maybe work fix problem. not sure.  half way thru book then book stops and says&#34;Finished&#34;. When book was converted to Kindle version must not have been done correctly.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased this case because of it's waterproof and fall protection features.  I have had it less than a month and already the case is useless. While in my pocket at work, the case broke at an unknown time.  I did not have any collisions or impact situations that should have caused this. One it broken by the charger port, it was no longer waterproof.  Then the phone fell from my kitchen table to the ground and the case broke at a different area. I had already purchased a second case because this one was no longer waterproof. It failed the waterproof test and does not work properly. I would not reccomend this product to anyone.  I would suggest going with an otterbox case and keeping your phone away from water.
B0068857QA|3.0|The film is beautifully shot.  Not all, but a lot of the acting is very good.<br />Many scenes were added that I don't remember being in the book.<br />I guess for fictional realism?<br />The film is even more ludicrous in several of its characterizations than the most disgruntled grunt in the Crotch could erect in his most horrid MOP suit frustration.<br />It is in love with its own inane banter.  Yeah, it was funny locker room cutting up, but filtered through look how bad we as a country are glasses it falls flat very fast.  I get Marine Corps humor.  Too bad the producers didn't.  A little schoolgirlish, like - did you hear what the naughty boy said.<br />If you want to hate Leathernecks, do it honestly.  Please.<br />Also, many of the songs they lads were singing as they drove along to Tipperary were old thirty years ago.  Maybe they learned them from the Singing Frog.<br />Overall, somebody watched a little bit too much Dr. Strangelove.<br />Get on line.  Shift left.  Keep your interval.
B0043ISH6O|4.0|After hearing the music while watching the film, I was blown away by how much it added to the viewing experience. The mix of subtle tones give it such a certain feel and mood. A great score to accompany the movie!
B00371QQ0M|5.0|. . . in great cinematography. Eye Candy. The narration gets to be a little much, but then that's this movie. Having just bought a new HD AV Receiver this is one that I just had to have for &#34;the experience&#34;. I'm really looking forward to this.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|Well, it is something that everyone should watch, with a grain of salt in many cases.  Most people these days have no idea where their food comes from, so some of the things in this video will be shocking to them.  Most people don't fully realize that meat comes from animals, and that to get the meat the animal must be killed and butchered.  There are several very educational segments of this video given by farmers/ranchers that make it worthwhile.  But if you want to watch it, check it out from your local library - you don't need to own a copy.
B003F48E4W|5.0|. . . Blu-ray. I have this movie on LaserDisc and have always liked it. I just got a new HD AV Receiver and wanted to get a couple of (new to me on BD) movies to add to my collection that I thought would utilize the features of my new toy. Plus the price was great. We'll see if the print lives up to my hopes.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|It fits my Nikon Coolpix S8100 camera perfectly.  The padding on all sides protects the camera from minor bumps.  The black color does not draw attention to it from thieves.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|. . . Too bad the second one was not as &#34;imaginative&#34;. It was more socio-political. This was a great movie for music and I just got a new HD AV Receiver and wanted to get a couple of (new to me on BD) movies to add to my collection that I thought would utilize the features of my new toy. Plus the price was great. We'll see if the print lives up to my hopes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very well set up game. i pass a lot of time with it. one of the best city building games ive seen. VERY VERY ...ADDICTIVE!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say besides that the Walking Dead just keeps getting better with every episode. I don't have cable so I got the episodes on Amazon and can watch them the next morning and again whenever I want. I didn't get the HD version of the season but when I watch on my tv via my Roku device the quality is great since I have an HDMI cable. If you're going to watch it through the computer I recommend you get the HD version.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Bought this for my 5 yr. old granddaughter.  We all love it.  It's always nice to see the bad guy do a turn around.
1579128149|5.0|I got The Elements Calendar 2012 from a temporary calendar shop.l liked it so much I wanted the 2013 version, which Amazon provided. This book has not just 12 elements, but all of them! I put it in my coffee table for adults to browse through.  I really enjoy reading about the common applications for the various elements. The photographs are interest-arousing and many are beautiful. I want to get the box of cards next, to set on my coffee table for young ones to look at.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I'm too lazy to record and watch from my program listings......plus I like to watch without planning.  I got hooked on this series because of the setting, costumes and historical setting.  At first the characters were a little off-putting, but now I get them all.  And I love them all......... what a wonderful way to get a peak into English country aristocratic living from a balanced point of view.  Wonderful series....... please don't stop with season 3.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|I just DLed the album, so I am basing this on 2 full run thrus of it, but so far so good! I found myself only like parts of UNO and DOS, where this whole album played thru and I wanted to hear it again right away. I am a big Green Day fan, but I gravitate more towards their 1990s/early 2000s albums, however I would say this one is worth it if you are a GD fan!
B005CRQ4OW|2.0|Great!!!! Fantastic funny best good great book greatest<br />Best book ever  Funny and fantastic I like it best book ever!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|What a History lesson, a reminder as the the true cost of freedom, and why we need to protect them.<br />Well done, a reminder as to why America has always been in love with Julie Andrews. M.N.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it... now I'm a guy who likes very few chick flics and would rather watch a show that blows things up.  However I've invested some time following this series and would recomend it to anyone.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Since I have spent time in India, I have come to understand  how much the people revere Gandhi. Sri Bhagavan of the Oneness University there is now helping people around the world to Awaken to the God Within. He commented that India could not have evolved, nor would his work have been done at this time, had it not been for Gandhi's work. In the past they were so enslaved that they actually worshiped poverty. They are becoming a very highly educated people, and I witnessed how evolved the woman have become in just the past 30 years. M.N. Washington State USA<br />.( I want to comment that even to this day, the people still carry genetically the programing that they were forced into during all those years of slavery. They, for the most part, will not say &#34;no&#34; to a white person)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I hope that they come out with another Harry potter movie. this one is great to watch I got it for a gift.
B004FQX59I|5.0|I had read the book and as soon as I finished the book, I just had to see the movie. I'm glad I did so. Oliver Stone did an awesome job. Wish I would've seen it in the big screen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY ALL THREE BOOKS AT ONCE.....they leave u hanging and wanting more.  It really is a love story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is amazing! Although it's very addicting :) and fun. I had never played it before it sure is FUN.
B009C7JS14|2.0|Wasn't really thrilled with this app.  I've tried it a few times but always give up on it ... just don't like it!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|i went from a razer copperhead to this, so its a different animal.(rodent) it is light like some reviewers say even with weights installed,so maybe manufacturer can increase the weights in the future. software is the best i have used period,you can reassign or disable buttons. the side lower bottom button is getting in thbut i may just need to get accustom to a new and different mouse.the company appears to care about its products and customer satisfaction. which is unusual now a days. other wise a great mouse at a fantastic price. just needs a little adjustment with heaver weights and tweak those side buttons a little and it will be the mouse of the century.(drama added). will update review after using mouse a bit.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Found this app to be fun for about a minute.  After that it was just too much of the same thing.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|\\"You need somebody who's a somebody to put their name on it. Somebody respectable. With credits. Who you can trust with classified information. Who will produce a fake movie. For free.\\" In Iran in 1979 the citizens were not happy. The Shah who massacred the people was sick and given refuge in the US. When the US refused to extradite him the citizens stormed the American Embassy and took 52 hostages. Six managed to escape before the embassy was overrun and find refuge with the Canadian Embassy. Worried their lives will be in danger when the hostage takers find out the launch a rescue effort. The best bad idea they had was to set up a fake movie and fly them out as part of the crew. The movie is fake but the drama and story is real. Sometimes seeing a movie after it's been hyped up you are disappointed. After all the talk of this plus it's Golden Globe wins really put this in an area where you have a certain expectation. This is one of the few that can hold up to those expectations. The movie was very very good combining humor and extremely tense situations made it extremely entertaining. I knew really nothing about this aspect of the actual story so the whole thing was new to me and that helped my enjoyment. I still think Lincoln was a better movie but if this does win best picture at the Oscars I would not be disappointed or surprised. This is a definite must see. Overall, one of the best movies of the year. I give it an A.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I'm not too sure about this app.  I keep trying to use it but I'm not sure I like the way it works....so the jury is still out on this one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a very fun game and really neat to play. I have played all 4 levels and won most of them.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I love my new cd. It is amazing, and anyone who likes One Direction should buy it! After you buy it you can download it to your phone or mp3 player, or like I did, to your Kindle Fire. Great thing to buy.
1469225700|4.0|Good stuff but be prepared to spend half of the book trying to figure out who is who and what is what! It's very complicated. Good enough for me to buy the next one!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so degrading to woman I can not believe it is a best seller and it makes me ashamed that women allow this.  This is the reason women are treated with disrespect in the first place, sending men mixed signals
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|At first I thought I would not like it...I avoided watching it on regular TV. I thought there was no way they could do justice to the Sherlock Holmes genre, setting it in modern day America and Watson as a woman.  I was sure it would be a cheap fake attempt to \\"cash in\\" on the success of Conan Doyle.  Then curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the pilot episode on my Kindle Fire and was hooked right away.  Characters are right on.  If Conan Doyle created Holmes today, this is what he would have come up with.  Best wishes to a long life for this series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun!!! It is always so hard to make myself stop playing!!! My daughter's and I fight over the game all the time.
B00633W614|5.0|Mr Archer is a new author to me since getting my Kindle.  But his stories are engaging and I find myself not only wanting to keep reading (long after I should be sleeping); but I look forward to anything he writes.  A great read!
B002NJWHHA|4.0|Very good movie but I was surprised by how different the book was from the movie and how many parts were cut out. Even though it was extended edition it was so short and lacked much details from the book. The overall quality was great and I<br /> think it was worth it to rent it.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|This is the 6 DVD set showing the entire first season, plus bonus interviews.  Very good. This has the multiple pilot movies too. If  you watched this show as a kid back in the 70's and were a fan, this is the DVD set for you. Great set.  Highly recommended. Did you know that's a real crash, that ABC used in the opening scene?  It's true.
B001HN6922|1.0|We watched Cars with our four years old son and he enjoyed it. We were looking forward to more family friendly entertainment with Cars 2 (Rated G). What a huge let down. The spy plot is so complicated that our son kept asking what was going on. He was confused and lost interest quickly. McQueen is rarely present in the movie. Cars spend most of the movie shooting at it each other. Really? I thought cars were supposed to *race* one another. Very disappointed at Disney for allowing this kind of violence to permeate every aspect of our lives. Shame on them.
0783240287|5.0|Originally I signed this out at the library not knowing what to expect. Didn't know Donny Osmond was in it either, but he did a great job as Joseph. The music was what sold me on it. Liked it so much, I bought it. The blonde English girl who does the narration has a terrific singing voice. Good musical.
160774273X|5.0|This is a great step-by-step guide to artisan bread. I was able to use my Aldi enameled Dutch Oven but had to buy a basket ($20,) and a steel lid handle ($7.50) besides the $20 for the book. I made half a recipe so was able to use a large mixing bowl instead of the giant tub. My bread got a bit misshapen while doing the transfer from the basket to the oven but it straightened itself out pretty well to my awe and surprise. Can't wait to try the fancy multi-day creations now.<br /><br />I'll be visiting friends in Portland this summer and hope to meet Ken and thank him.
B00A1AF4DM|2.0|I like this reader (previously listened to Koontz' Frankenstein read by him), but honestly, since when is Costa Rica pronounced Cahstah Ricah?  And King David Kalakaua's name doesn't have a diacritical between the a and the u, so the street isn't pronounced kal-a-kah-oo-a, it's ka-la-kow-a.  That sort of stuff drives me nuts and isn't hard to find out.  A quick call to the Hawaii Public Library would answer those questions.<br /><br />But the book.........remember Honey I Shrunk the Kids?  ;-)
B0018BB21G|5.0|Easily my favorite MB album.  Replaced vinyl with this and the extra cuts were great, especially &#34;OM&#34;.  Highly recommended and going from vinyl to CD sound was still great (though not a scratchy).
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I'm sure he tells us truthfully what he experienced during his coma event, but Heaven, don't think so.  I thought someone had to die, completely, to go to heaven, or the other place.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thought this was a very good story line.  Couldn't put this book down.  So true of things that happen in today's world
1595827684|5.0|I started playing the games about about a month and a half ago, mostly out of curiosity. Before you know it, I was clocking more hours played than I was actually getting in sleep per day, and that's with a full time job and family. After I completed the trilogy (game) I realized that I am ruined. No other game will ever measure up.<br />When my daughter saw how obsessed I was with the game, she surprised me with this book. What a fantastic gift and definitely one that I will cherish. It details how each character was created and offers a little background into the creative process that went into creating the Mass Effect Universe.<br />Because I'm not yet prepared to give up this tale, I have submerged myself in the comics, the first novel and a failed attempt (already) at finding another game that matches up, even a bit, to this. Believe me, there is nothing.<br />The artwork is superb and it is awesome to get the chance to learn the inspiration behind each race, and my favorite characters.<br />I'd recommend this book to lovers of the ME games, comic, books, and back story, as well as artists and writers who wish to get a little insight into the process of character development.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Use my Kindle Fire to see lots of good ideas.  Open postings from Facebook most of the time.  The pictures are clear.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it has quite crisp graphics and runs faster and smoother than tu would expect,  gives they sonic the hedgehog feel bit with more control needed and involved for never have played a game quite like this I was ber impressed doth it
B001ZG4J00|5.0|it is sad that we had to wait for this movie to find out about this great artist- wonder why?
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It was a page turner. Bring out the tissues. I finished the book in no time . Would recommend this book to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Got this app for my little nephew.  He loves it.  Could not stop playing. The graphics are very nice and very interesting.<br />Easy to manage and get all kinds of goodies.  I will recommend it.<br />Amazon should get more games like this.......  Very very nice
B000022TSW|5.0|Brilliantly sly and layered yet over-the-top social commentary.  Very funny.  It's definitely a must-have, and not only for Parker/Stone fans.

1451613512|5.0|Stone and Kuznick ask one remaining question that they indicate only readers can answer....Is it too late for America to Change? If Stone and Kuznick read Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" written in 1902 about British Imperialism in the Congo (Ivory trade) and how human ethics/behaviors and the way the checks and balances within modern societies are suspended or replaces with profit motives/greed, once businesses begin operations in third world countries the answer seems hopelessly....no.<br /><br />Just as the British treated the natives in the Congo and refered to them as \\"primative cultures\\" and forced the natives to work/live in hard conditions while expropriating profits back to England......so do modern day imperialist nations.The Untold History of the United States indicates/documents once again that historically  the humanity exercised by businesses overseas since Joseph Conrad wrote his book....hasn't changed.<br /><br />My thanks to Stone and Kuznick for their update on the human condition.There still is a need for businesses to engage in foreign economic development and making reasonable profits for their companies, while adhering to modern societial behavioral rules that are based on notions of right and wrong.

B009VA1FN6|4.0|I have never read Kate Morton before. The twists and  turns kept me on my toes. The social history and poetic language that flowed seamlessly was pure joy.  I am now deeply absorbed  in The Shifting Fog and am very excited to have discovered a new author.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game can keep anyone entertained non-stop. At first I thought it was a bit hard to play, but once I figured it out it was so much fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Im a picky reader. Its hard to find anythimg I can really indulge in. It was so interesting that I finished in two days. This book made me cry so much that my entire body shook. For a few days I was so depressed that my teacher suggested counseling. The ending was beautiful. Readers who enjoyed Stargirl and The Perks of Being a Wallflower will love this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We like to watch all BBS movies series. Great entertainment. I would recommend this series to anyone. If you like old England this is it.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|I enjoy ZZ Top's style.  As with all music, the listener will have to decide on thier own if they like it or not.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|Got it fast. I love this album. I recommend this album to everyone. I will go through this dealer again.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These Joseph Joseph utensils are a must in the kitchen.  They are very ergonomic and easy to hold.  No more messes with the elevated feature (utensil side does not touch counter or stove top when put down). I also appreciate how the utensils are not extremely long like other sets out there right now, so they are not cumbersome to maneuver.  Great set.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! Me and my brothers play it all the time. It's one of those games that u wanna play for 5 minutes then it's 20 minutes later, it's a awesome sequel<br /> !!!!!
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love Big Bang Theory!  I had watched it on and off on tv but never the full season. BBT is a show that has very clever and well crafted hilarious dialogs.  Enjoyed it immensely!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great because they constantly give you rewards. Also, your horse can compete in super fun competitions. It makes you feel like you have a horse (or a unicorn, you can buy one)
B00992CF6W|5.0|you people of mojang are so nice cud finnally youbgot it for the kindle its about time and you'll love it
0525951652|5.0|This book, like all his others, does not let the reader down. Only wish Ken were much younger, so he could write epic tales for decades more. Ken is among the very best historical authors, makes me feel I am there in the midst of his story! Love it!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I liked it because most don't have as much things as this one and it has pie the number .
B00066FED6|3.0|Northanger Abbey-Film quality somewhat lacking, appeared &#34;dated&#34;, which, of course, it is.  Odd storyline, in particular the swimming scene.  Peter Firth is the good actor in this movie, not the heroine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|not a bad game... if ur looking to kill some time its fun... great for kids... only downfall I see is only one other horse can be bought without using gems...
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Not a very good book.<br /><br />First of all there were countless mistakes.  It was like when the author was finished she hit spell check and then change all.  \\"Wood\\" turns into \\"would\\", the main character Thor becomes \\"though\\" and there are many other instances of this.<br /><br />The story is too perfect.  The good guys are 100% good and the bad guys are 100% bad.  Everything happens too perfectly for this kid.<br /><br />Right off the bat he discovers immeasurable magical power, has the most beautiful girl in the land, who happens to be the kings daughter, fall madly in  love with him.  The king adopts him upon their first meeting.  After receiving no training he is sent on patrol to the wild lands outside the protection of the \\"ring\\" and does great heroic deeds.<br /><br />This book isn't realistic in any sense.  It seems like this is the authors first book and it was half assed.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Johnny Lee Miller's portrayal is so endearing: his Sherlock is damaged and quirky, without the overpowering condescension we seen in the British TV version. The storyline is genius: Watson = female sober-companion, and subtly played by Lucy Liu - whose character has her own damage-stuff going in. The cases are interesting. Aiden Quinn is lovely in his role - he always brings such gravitas. It's a GREAT show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had to get this book after I finished the first one.  This is the best of the three books.  Definately recommend it.
0062124293|5.0|This book is brilliant and hilarious. Caitlin Moran is so poignant and so validating that it makes me want to read it over and over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an awesome book and a fairly easy read.  Finished it in less than a week.  So good I had to buy the other two.
6300181553|5.0|This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book.  I enjoyed reading all three books in the trilogy and would recommend them for others to read and enjoy.
630289915X|5.0|This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - so much insight into the poverty in India, but a wonderful story - wish it was a little longer
6301442962|5.0|This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use. It provides the accuracy I require. It is entirely recommendable.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was very interesting, and it has some good interesting in the book make you want to read it more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book club book in a long time, that drew me in.  You think you know what is going on and then suddenly, you don't.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very good read. Keeps your interests until the very end. Surprised that this was one of the author first books.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this for my Nikon D3100, It fits perfectly & works amazing!<br />You can clearly see a difference in picture quality with this compared to just using the camera's regular flash. Some pictures come out so great that there's no need for any editing/retouching!<br />Packaging for this item was beyond perfect... BEYOND! Shipping was also fast.<br />I have no complaints about this item<br />Highly recommended
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This app is amazing at first. I love the grafics and sound but after a while it wouldn't let me into the app. SO good luck and have fun while you can.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|I read before going to sleep at night.  I'm typically not easily affected by what I read, so it may be that it's because this book is very well written, but it is not a good match for my late night read.
B008M36EEI|3.0|A good movie to kill some time.  The dry humor of the early portions of the movie centered around the bizarre project being proposed was well done.  The later parts of the movie were a bit predictable, which lowered my rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down till the very last page.  It was a real page turner.  Loved the book.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I can't believe how rad the tripod is. so cheap it blows my mind. i love this so much. buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson who just turned 3,, loves this. game! He asks as soon as he enters the door to have gtandma' s kindle.  And to tell you the. Truth. he does areally good job at it. Thanks for a very. Entertaining game!99
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a simple but happy game where you get 40 coins to start with -then you touch the screen to drop coins in front of the coin dozer so more coins or prizes could be ushed forward over the edge.  It works great and it entertains me enough that I play it once or twice a day.
B002CIY8EM|2.0|The book is exactly what I wanted but I selected the additional whisper sound for $3+ dollars and somehow that was dropped from my order and I have yet to hear back from anyone in regards to why!  Not happy.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The game is great. The graphics are really good for an android game. I find myself playing this game all the time. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes animals,
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I admit I was a little skeptical - but these workouts work. Love that you can choose from 5 - 10 minutes for each area of the body.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great game! the only thing is that when you try to reserect your self with gems, it will put me right back at the menu and my game I just played isn't saved. so if I were to go like 7 million and used a gem it would send me to the menu not saving my score :( otherwise awesome game no lag! :)
B009VB97EY|3.0|Though the dancing was great the plot not so much. The love story the trailer makes it out to be is not really developed at all and things just end up disjointed. A 'renter not a buyer.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Some graphic and violent scenes described, but for any thriller/mystery readers a must read.  Thank goodness I read the book before seeing either movie so the plot twists were unexpected and kept me on the edge of seat. The second in the series was a slight disappointment, but mostly because of the expectations the first set.
B006885EFE|5.0|This WWII series is 1 of the best I have seen.<br />There is something in it for everyone. Only complaint - too short.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is a fun and addictive game, I like the puzzles and story line, they make you think to figure them out, the graphics are decent,  if you like puzzles and dark mysteries with a story behind it, you'll like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game it's SUPER cool I think that this game should have a part two and more characters and more upgrades! :)
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved Harry Potter and this book shows Rowling is not just a children's author.  The characters and plot intricacies in this book were fantastic.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a fun game for 3 or 4 people. It's easy to learn. There are lots of strategies to use as the board changes from game to game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this game for my granddaughter but I play it more then she does lol. The only problem is sometimes it won't load and I have to restart my kindle. That's frustrating
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Showcases the varieties of ways of making sense out of chaos.The camera work is incredible, as is the pace. There are scenes that I would like to have on a continual loop.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check the weather 2 and 3 times a day. I love all the features such a maps, forecasts and current conditions.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|After I read the majority of the reviews, I decided to buy the tripod. First off, it's cheap. Second, I have a gorillapod and I just needed something that could hold onto my iphone 5 because I do film a lot with it. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I would not recommend using the top part on anything wider than the iPhone 4 or 4s because already when I put my phone in, it has already almost reached as far as it can go. It does well when you have a thin phone cause on it as well. Like said, bottom part is useless. Doesn't really do a good job of holding anything. But I keep it around because it's fine when you need it for FaceTime. Shipping was fast! I ordered it a week and a half ago. I knew it would take a long time because it came from china but the expected time was around late February to early march and I got it on feb 9th! Everything was intact and I'm satisfied.
0393327345|3.0|Im a huge palahniuk fan, and I love his books.  I usually love most books more than the movie, but us is an exception.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great time passer. I love playing it and I love that I can compete with my friends. I hope they come out with a second one!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I  highly recommend Downton Abbey to everyone.  It is a very well written, well acted mini-series.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot that will keep you tuning in week after week.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have been playing the game and I love it, at times it gets pretty frustrating but you have to keep going.
B0073SPDHM|5.0|This was a huge success. Everyone gained weight after trying out all those great recipes.  Wonderful new ideas and yummy desserts.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I down loaded this for my brother just before he passed, and like all chess games, he really enjoyed himself.  He passed a few weeks after this was downloaded and I do not play but it gave him enjoyment.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The story could have been a good one.  Too much S & M.  I realize this is a large part of the plot but it could have been done with a lot less detail.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Like all of my Mahjong games all are a little different in one way or the other.  They are all good exercise for the eyes and the old thinking cap.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I came upon this book after reading the author's more recent novel, Gone Girl. It's a great read that will keep you finding the time to turn more pages and keep you guessing till the end. The way the narrative flows, it draws you in to want these characters to live despite already knowing their grim fate. Often times it reminded me how tragedy comes in unexpected globs, where one moment you're doing something as simple as a family dinner and the next hoping for something so simple and mundane. Flynn has a way of writing that gets me so engrossed in her stories that I want more, sequels, transported into their world, anything to find out more.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I have Adobe Air on my pc at home and my tablet.  It has never crashed on me but keeps things running smooth.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|Much too long, he could have told the same story in a much more concise manner. Interesting subject but poor execution.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love all of my Mahjong games, but they are all a little different in ways.  If you want to exercise your eyes along with your brain these are the games to try.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great way to help you fall asleep.<br />Not the best sleep app. Out there but for free you cant beat it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies for an awesome price! Has hours of behind the scenes footage for the batman fanatics out there in movie land!
B00322PK2G|5.0|Super watch, as a swatch collector - I need basic white and black. Tick is fine - I have 35 swatch watches. This style, this is the 5th color I have purchased. Durable, it pops, very cool, jazzy. Good communication w. seller.... Amazon needs to work on its packing technique, needs bubble on top and bottom of the case. Everything in order, original case, watch shows up in perfect working order to my eye. Haven't worn it yet - my watches must match my outfits. And why not? Life is short, if I run out of time, I just grab another swatch! so rock on sellers, great job - talking to me, putting me at ease, and following through on all my concerns as a collector. 5 star!~
0765325950|5.0|Loved the final novel in this series. I feel Brandon did a great job in finishing out the series. I know this was a difficult job for him considering the large cult following of the WOT series. There were literally hundreds of &#34;rabbit trails&#34; that Jordan had led us down through out the books, and Jordan and Brandon managed to resolve most of them!
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I thought it would be scary, but it was more mystery oriented.  Had a little twist.  I liked it a lot!
1451695195|3.0|I have read dozens of books written by people who have NDE\\"s. Although I believe this story is true, there is very little info on what happened during his NDE.  He talks mostly about his life and his medical condition.  I would not waste my money on this book. There are much better books out there written by people who have had NDE's.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is really fun...it does take a bit to get the hang of it but it is really addictive!! after a while it can get kinda boring though as u play the same thing over and over its alot like temple run....u can choose from different peaple to play with but there are highly priced in coins but other than that stuff its a fun game
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|Piscine Molitor Patel, named after a French swimming pool, grew up in a Zoo in India. One would think that would be enough to make him unique, but there is more, much more.<br /><br />He survives the sinking of a ship that killed his entire family and most of the zoo animals, he lived for 227 days in the company of a bengal tiger named Richard Parker, discovers a carnivorous island populated by meerkats. Eventually he lands in Mexico. Sounds insane? Pure fiction? Read the book, then you decide. A beautiful, terrible story, a glimpse inside the mind of a truly unique person, richly detailed, you will have difficulty putting it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love those on much it is like the new cool thing like it is the new angry birds but angry birds is not THAT fun it is like any other thing that is popular but not that good
B002LII6KA|5.0|Nice collection, if you are a matrix Fan you should really have this amazing collection<br />Animatrix<br />The Documental<br />Deleted Escenes<br /><br />At the end of the third movie you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel.
B00457WZEI|5.0|this book was exciting and its a \\"cant put it down\\" book i loved it and cant wait to see the movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a truly great story with excellent plotting, character development, and an easy writing style that pulls you into the story.  The book is a nice, medium-long but fast paced novel with suspense, surprises, thrilling successes and wrenching failures.  I would say the quality was on level with some of the great science fiction I grew up on (Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, etc.).  I found it as good as or better than The Passage, but a faster and easier read.  I would say I enjoyed this book a little more than The Hunger Games/sequels and almost as much as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series.  The story is complete, but leaves a whole lot of room for sequels or prequels.  (Please, Hugh!!!)  By the way, the title is perfect, as you'll see....
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The story line is a good one. However, the author spent much of her time describing the setting and not enough time developing the plot and building the mystery. If you like a good descriptive piece with little development of the murder plot then this is the story for you. I give it 2 stars as the writer did not leave any loose ends and there was mystery to be found,even if you had dig through .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Have enjoyed it just as much as when we watched it the first time.  Had to get it to gear up for airing of season 3 (which we are loving)! The only complaint is the covers nor the dvd menus give any type of title for each episode so it is hard to remember what chapter you are on by just a disc and number.  But other than that this was great.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|Lots of fun. Getting use to using fingers little by little. I enjoy the game very much. The more I play it the more better I'm getting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is soo cool like you can play forever. you will love it get it. it will never crash it is better then the old one
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|awesome album. great sing a long. listen to it in my car everyday on the way to work. bruno mars rocks
B0027MJU00|5.0|I had this book and the two others by Flynn recommended to me recently and I am so glad that I did!  This was sooooo good!  I stayed up way past my bedtime reading about Libby and her family.  I connected with her - even though I am nothing like her.  Just the right amount of suspense and twists.  Great read!!!!  (and good vocabulary! I am a teacher and sophisticated reader and can be so disappointed with the little vocabulary choices of current best sellers, but not Dark Places!).
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|After getting a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, I needed something to carry it in.  This works perfectly and protects the Kindle.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|So your cousin is getting married in Vegas and you're one of the bridesmaids. You realize you have no hope of ever getting married and end up drinking with your cousins the night before the wedding. You're drunk, yet have fallen desperately in love with a strange man. The next thing you remember, you're vomiting into the toilet in a glamorous hotel room with a wedding ring on your finger.<br /><br />I'm glad this has never happened to me, but I could only imagine the feelings pouring through Megan's head as she wakes up to find herself married to a very handsome fellow who believes in love at first sight and doesn't believe in divorce.<br /><br />Mira Lyn Kelly did a fantastic job writing this story, keeping it moving and keeping the reader on their toes. I honestly couldn't put the book down! It flowed, making me want to turn the page to the next chapter. There are some very intimate moments which get hot and heavy, but it's written well.<br /><br />I most definitely would read this book again and would recommend it to other readers.<br /><br />This book receives 5 out of 5 stars!
B00797MB0O|5.0|Young Adult is probably more of a darker tragicomedy and cautionary tale than a comedy.  Charlize's character is depicted as a city-dwelling party-girl and child's book author who does not care for children, spending her time enjoying her singleton freedom, living a disposable life that awkwardly yearns for the nostalgia of her free, promiscuous 20s. Both Patton Oswald and Charlize Theron performed brilliantly in this movie, and I believe it was both entertaining and worthwhile to have watched, unlike many of the haters in the reviews here.  I had the misfortune of watching this film in the same weekend as \\"Take this Waltz\\". It's a good thing I didn't have a shotgun nearby.  Jeeeeeez.  If you don't like downers, stay far far away from this.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Lots of action and very exciting.  Beautiful photography.  Particularly the scenes in Alaska.  Gave me something to do on a rainy and cold day.
B001CDZZI6|3.0|If you have never used any other tool to assess personality and style, along with aptitude, this book might be a real eye-opener for you.  But if you and your company have used other profile instruments such as LIFO or DISC, or some of the other many instruments that are out there, Strengths Finder will seem like a rehash of familiar material to you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great and simple game of solitaire.  The game is challenging, but installation and playing is simple.  Cards are big enough to actually see the faces.  Love it for stress relief on a quick break, or while waiting to see someone.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I got a wonderful deal on this around Christmas time & couldn't be happier with it... the packaging is great, the box looks cool on the shelf & the dragon egg looks really neat too! I was going to buy the Season 1 set anyway & was thrilled when this premium set had a big discount at the holidays... Thanks amazon!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'm not much of a techie, but had no trouble installing and using this ap both onto my Kindle Fire and Android.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Easily one of the best books I have ever read. Definitely gonna get the sequel. Highly recommend to anyone of my friends.
B005LAIIA8|3.0|I give it a 3 star because my kids enjoyed this movie. I don't think it is a &#34;grown-up&#34; movie.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|if u have a kindle fire don't buy this game. after the first play it wont let u play again
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|i had never purchased a tip album before but after hearing sorry and addresses I went and bought it.. hes got some bangers on here too with g season him and meek milly get busy.. im thinking ill go out and but the previous album he put out to this and see how far i can get on his catalog.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love everything about this book. The letters are so vivid that you can't help but feel like the characters are friends. The story is set in a time and place I found particularly interesting and it left me wanting to learn more about the German occupation of the Channel Islands.
B003PJUAB2|5.0|Great collection of wonderful songs that really represent the best of Paul and his music. Has been a favorite of mine since the original release.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have been using this app on all of my phones for many years now. It is nice to be able to use it on the Kindle fire hd. Nice big picture for the map.
B004P91ARE|5.0|i love this cd..play it all the time nice to have it on my kindlefire, a timeless work of art
B0094BB4TW|4.0|its all in the same for most  facebook apps on phones or ipod types. I just wish there was a download for the facebook messenger
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter loaded his game on my Kindle.  I became addicted right away. Fun and easy to play and the games get harder as you move on!  Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldnt keep out of it, was very into this book. I think i had it read within a few days.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|A pack of 5 was $1.77. It's a very great deal and they are working well. I would recommend these to anyone!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Well done and exciting! A great addition to the original series.  It will have you on teh edge of your seat.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have fallen in love with this series.  Hope it goes on for many more seasons.  The actors fit the characters so well.  I could not wait for the rest of the series, so I just purchased all of them at once.  I'm on my third time watching all episodes.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Amazing best book ever. I cried a little fishing every chapter. Stephanie Meyers props to you you write wonderful books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this cute game. Similiar to Temple Run. Graphice are great on our Kindle Fire. Highly recommend. My 5 year daughter enjoys it very much.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was recommended to me, and I will always be grateful my friend for that.  Even while reading the forward, my eyes watered several times-- this writer gets me!  That has been a rare feeling throughout my life.  I have always needed down time, me only time,  and the profession I chose allows me to spend big chunks of time by myself.  But I never really understood what this all meant until I read the book. I knew I was an introvert (which is not to be confused with shy, by the way.  I am not shy) and people didn't understand why I hated going to parties and large gatherings, and why I love hiking, kayaking, and reading along with  other solitary pursuits.  I didn't understand it myself.  This book helped me immensely, I have recommended it to many people already, and If you are or love an introvert ( my husband is an extrovert-this explains us quite well) read this. It's a gift.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2.. or assassins creed 4. think about it.... an assassin explorer could only be followed on this map by a Templar monkey.
159514188X|5.0|It was a great book. An easy read for a day or two. Very interesting POV and unique storyline. Would always recommend. :)
B002BWP49C|1.0|Looks like my package was sent to some Florida address and not the California one I gave you. Maria at mmarinez@ymail.com.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, it is addicting and a boredom buster. The original temple run is good but this is better.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|worked great for 1st week or so.  then just stalls out. hard to imagine that fb and kindle cant get it right or not make available until it works
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|I generally enjoyed reading \\"Why Nations Fail\\".<br />Seemingly & Robinson used of historical examples combined with contemporary successes and failures showed their ideas of extractive verse inclusive political and economic institutions relate to a nation's property.<br />Must read for policy makers.
B000TEPED0|5.0|First off I'm a huge Eric Church fan so this a little biased, but I love this album. Eric Church is one of the few modern country artists that sticks to the old style of telling a story through his songs and singing about things that all of us deal with in life and this album is by far his best work at that. I have probably listened to the whole cd about once a day for the past six months that's how good it is
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie is an interesting concept. The main character doesn't have much of a redeemable quality and I never really connected to him. The younger actor does do a good job of looking like his future self.  It was a &#34;darker&#34; film with the portrayal of drug use, violence, language. Not a good movie for kids or wives who don't like violent movies. Glad I didn't go to the theater to see this but I did enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing fun and puzziling if you enjoy unlocking new games you will love it is so fun!!!!!! I love it
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wasn't very interested in this show when it first came out. In my mind the actor Jeremy Brett is the definitive portrayal of Homes. The new PBS series with a modern day Sherlock played by Cumberbatch is really good. And then theres the Robert Downey Jr. version...yeah, not my favorite, but entertaining. I didn't think I had room for any more versions of Sherlock, but I was wrong. I happened upon an episode one night and was immediately hooked. I then had to see the earlier episodes I'd missed. Then I got my wife hooked. The show is well written and keep you interested. It also stays true to much of Conan Doyle's writing although with a much more modern twist.  I find this Sherlock more likable than the new PBS series Sherlock. The fact that they've turned Watson into a girl doesn't bother me a bit and I like Lucy Liu's character.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series.
B00APACSJG|5.0|I just discovered Bujold's writing when I picked up CAPTAIN VORPATRIL'S ALLIANCE and am now in the process of gulping down her backlist.  Boy am I glad she's prolific.  I thoroughly enjoyed CRYOBURN even though it does not contain many of the previous characters she has introduced in previous books (except for the evolving character of Armsman Roic whom I first met covered in butterbug butter, but that's another story).  Miles continues to grow as a character and I look forward to seeing where his new duties will take him.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Good for kids too!  I like that it brought up the some big issues that we do not seem to talk about.  Great cast!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Great new Christmas classic adding to our collection! My Grandkids loved it. One we will be watching every year for Chistmas tradition.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was so well written that I barely know where to start.  The characters are realistically drawn, and the author is insightful.  The quest for the answers to the heroine's  past was riveting.  I recommend this to readers who like a mystery, but this book is not for the faint of heart.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is simple and easy to use and works great on my Kindle HD.  I can create lists for whatever I need to help keep me organized.  Easy to add and cross off or delete items you've done, and you can change colors of the lists to help better organize.  I recommend this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What more can I say without a doubt the best show on TV.  I can hardly wait for season 4.
B00004W50Z|5.0|Love the Band so loved this album.  Think this is the best one they made with my very favorite song &#34;Daniel's Harp&#34;.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|Once my cd player in my car took a dive, I realized I better get one of my favorites to add to the cloud.  It is a must have and I'm glad Amazon offers such a great way to store your music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was freaking awesome!!! I'm going to recommend this book to everyone! It was funny, sad, heartwarming and heartwrenching, which are all the I like in a book.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I could not make it through this book  because of the offensive language. I feel an author who cannot choose better words to get their message across, is not an author worth reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have to be careful about when I play on this game, a few minutes can quickly turn into a few hours.<br /><br />Since there are no instructions, youwill have to use your imagination and problem-solving skills.<br />My preteens had a hard time with this, they are used to games that tell you what to do and you just have to do it. Once they started out doing &#34;their own thing&#34; in the game and started getting back positive results they were hooked.<br /><br />We only play on the kindle and haven't yet played online with other players, so have no comment for that.<br /><br />I like the &#34;old school&#34; graphics.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Thought this was a wonderful playful romp.  It didn't require much from me and that was exactly what I needed!
0765325950|5.0|A worthy masterpiece finishing an outstanding series. What I liked the most was how every little detail fit into place, from the whole series. Who I dont recommend it to: who has not read the previous books. For those who have come to love Rand, Perrin or Egwene, or any of the other memorable characters, this book is a must have.
B008L1F91A|5.0|This is the first time I bought ArtFX toy and it looks great. My parents and younger sister, who don't buy this stuff, opened the package for me and told me that they want one also. Great job!
B00AWFEBDK|3.0|It´s a lot of information and the subject is fantastic. But this one is not so good as other books by the same author.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It's an amazing book. Am enjoying it immensley. I find that I have to be free of distractions when I go to read it. It requires my undivided attention.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|i loved this game and was really far and  had tons of coins, when i went to play it and it made me start over. the next day it made me start over again
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app, love horses &amp; all animals, &amp; can finally have my own horse &amp; she really is a &quot;Beauty.&quot;
0307352153|4.0|I found Quiet to be extremely interesting! I haven't the time to finish reading it, but the part I have read was very informative. Using historical information and scientific studies to back her arguments, Mrs. Cain presents the stark differences between introverts and extroverts, and the actual impact these differences can cause in schools, workplaces, and in personal situations. I highly recommend this book if you're at all interested in psychology. It's a little brainy for leisure reading, but it would make a good source for a school paper.<br /><br />  I received this book for free in exchange for review from WaterBrook Multonomah.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just needed a quick calculator on my Kindle Fire.  This was one of the first ones that came up in the results.  I was looking for a free one, so I downloaded it.  It was better than I thought.  The keys are nice and big, easy to press and the numbers are easy to read in the display.  Also, I like the swiping feature of the memory keys to other function keys.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|A Good fun  & sweet family film, smart enough for adults, wacky fun for kids. I very much enjoyed it. Great animation.
0307749584|5.0|I am huge fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher novels. It's a Great book on cd. A must 'read'.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This product worked as advertised and as the other reviews state. It maintains a charge and allows quick charging (1 hr) of an iphone 4s. I am recommending this to my friends.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Unclear of items that are able to be found. why doesnit say items arenavailable to find and they are not in the room?
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|It works great on other devices but is really choppy during playback if any transcoding is done on the kindle fire.  This makes it mostly useless if you aren't on your own network.  I tried using the silverlight and different settings but no success kn fixing it.
0375842209|5.0|This was a selection for our book club and I so enjoyed reading this story.  There is so much about Nazi Germany that I do not remember studying in school that when I read a book like The Book Thief and Sarah's Key, it makes me want to do research into Nazi Germany and to learn more.  This is an excellent book for both adults and young people.  One of the ladies was going to give it to her 19 year old grandson to read to help him understand better about tolerance.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read it in a day so I guess I really enjoyed it out was a good conclusion to the series
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This is a great boxed set with all of the 4 versions.  There is a reason this is such a classic dystopic Sci-fi movie.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am very pleased so far with the sharpener, I've used it to sharpen my pocket knives and paring knifes.  It does a great job.
0143117009|5.0|If you can handle the truth, Diamond actually maps a way through human folly. *Spoiler alert: more of the same isn't useful.
B001NLL93W|4.0|this book in the series really brings all the characters full circle, there are sad and very happy moments and big surprises.
B005LAII8A|3.0|This was more violent than I expected. It has some redeeming moments of humanity and it is interesting for anyone who likes time travel stories..
B000Y2M8K4|5.0|This is a lower rated &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray&#34; it seems. It was fun to watch with some real creativity involved. I gave it away as I was wondering why some female in my life was putting it in my vision. I guess she wants a spanking..I don't know though. Could be trouble. Seller was very fine. Thanks, guys.
B009KNPM9W|5.0|40 YEARS?  REALLY????  How can that possibly be?  I feel so old to have been on this planet long enough to recall this music when it was so brand new and hip-to-the-nanosecond.<br /><br />Of course, like many others, I have this album on vinyl... however I don't recall EVER feeling so drawn into it or so aware of every mellow note.  It's strange how each soulful stanza and vocal nuance speaks volumes now.  Like whoa!<br /><br />In addition to the original takes, there are so many different versions on the classic title song. While Trouble Man was a mildly successful film, the theme song stands on its own as one of Marvin's smoothest and most evocative recordings. It's both soulful and cinematic, full of bravado and Marvin's unique brand of cool.<br /><br />Truthfully, no matter your history with this music, it's almost like hearing it for the first time. All the truly great recordings should be treated to this type of reworking/remastering/revisitation. They allow all of us who loved this music or a particular artist to be exposed to the entire creative process. I am falling in LOVE all over again with Marvin's talent, especially during this particular period of his creativity. His output was so fresh and completely innovative. The jazz genre obviously inspired him and gave him a new vocal freedom. You can just tell how fertile he and the musicians were feeling  (you can actually HEAR it!), and how the union of their individual talents helped to forge this classic sonic wonder!<br /><br />Mad props to all the players, as well as MG's ingenuity. It is arrangements like these that played a large part in making me begin to really DIG JAZZ back in the day.<br /><br />If you are a Marvin Gaye fan, you owe it to yourself to invest in this version of Trouble Man.  Trust... you will NOT be sorry.<br /><br />This is one of the GREATS... a truly wonderful recording!!!<br /><br />One.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|This prequel of the original Star Trek series follows Capt. Archer (Scott Bakula of Quantum Leap) with a Vulcan T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) second in command  and the Enterprise crew as they explore where no man has been before. The show is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy, roughly during the 2150s--ten years before the United Federation of Planets shown in previous Star Trek series was formed. Jonathan Archer, captain of the Enterprise NX-01, leads a team of voyagers filled with enough drive and courage to power them through years of adventures in space. Along the way, the crew finds adventure with friends and foe extraterrestrials in all forms (e.g. Klingons, Suliban, Andorians, Xindi, the Guardians, Romulans, etc.).
B000002KK2|5.0|UNIQUE.  There is no better, nor more apt word to describe this artist (make that Artist with a CAPITAL A).  Much like those fellow sisters-in-songwriting before her (namely Joni Mitchell and Carole King), Rickie Lee Jones brings a very real and FELT sense of experience to her music.  Sometimes soft and pretty, bordering on frilly, and sometimes enlivened with a rasp of jazz,  at once child-like, and then other times she is completely flying around inside a vocal arena all her own, Rickie Lee Jones houses a virtual musical playing field inside her larynx.<br /><br />This entire album has long been a classic and out of the many collections that have come after it, it still remains the quintessential treasure chest of musicality one finds within the artistry of Ms. Jones, and thus, this debut is the go-to jam one needs to get acquainted with her style.<br /><br />From the first single \\"Chuck E's  in Love\\" her hip beat chick ode to the terminally whipped, to the sonic sorcery displayed best on \\"Last Chance Texaco\\" and the dreamily melancholy  \\"On Saturday Afternoons in 1963\\",  Jones mines such a versatile array of voices and visions, each touched by the fragile fingertips of poetry.<br /><br />While there is not a single misstep here, for me, the gem of this awesome collection would have to be \\"Coolsville.\\" It is in this one song that Jones applies all that she does best by exploring the past ghosts of relationships, mixed with touches of woozy vice and a doomed sense of romance. These elements linger in Jones' vocals like a daydream that clings to our waking hours.<br /><br />I could easily recommend Pirates, The Magazine, The Horses, It's Like This, Evening of My Best Day, or precious handful of other, more recent RLJ recordings, however, it is this, her Grammy-winning debut, where she is at the zenith of her utter, butter, most Rickie Lee Jones-ness.<br /><br />One.
B001CTDH76|4.0|I didn't get to finish watching it.  I like what I did see.  I just really like Simon Baker he is good and at times even funny.
B008BU70HW|4.0|I liked it very much. Reading about the characters and how they were included was very interesting .  I would reconnend it to any one who has enjoyed the Downton Abbey stories so far.  I particularly enjoy seeing and reading about England whatever period of time it is.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Got this product for my WW2-buff boyfriend. He was a huge fan of Band of Brother's, and the Pacific is almost as good. The Pacific focuses on a couple of different men-in different units. But we still learned a lot, and would recommend it to any WW2 buff.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story and thought it was well written. I grew up in the South, though not during this period) and know the love for the people depicted here. I am Irish and know how the circumstances of their lives could cause these things to happen.  I would readily recommend this book to any of my friends and in fact, my book club is reading it this year.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I hope my grandson gets tired of this by summer!!! He absolutely loves to watch this over and over! Great movie to have on these cold, winter days to entertain the 6 yr old. Hopefully this spring he will get outside some!! LOL Fast delivery too!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of tween novels but I heard too much about this book to let it go unnoticed. And that was an awesome choice. Loved it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The perspective of the two narrators keeps this book interesting, although the characters both end up being pretty twisted.  The author is good at building suspense and making the reader keep on reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game hooks you especially if you have real horses. the different ways the animals move are really life like
B007R21JJK|5.0|This was my first &#34;EUFI&#34; build and it was for a Kubuntu Linux box for a client, so I was a bit worried about the new bios. Nothing to fear though. It was a great experience. Like another reviewer noted, it didn't detect the speed of the RAM correctly on first boot, so I changed it manually. No big deal. I plan to build one of these for myself next.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't what I got. It was better. There were a few parts where I got bored with their back and forth trying to convince each other of whatever, But other than that it was a fun read.
B0000AYL17|5.0|I love Steely Dan .<br />This albun is a classic, and remastered (SACD) is better . Have a good time listening.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think I would give it a five star. I would like to see it every day. I think my Nene would like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wonderful.. play all the time<br />Run my battery down playn<br />all the time.. no cheats just play
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Kendal  has finally finished this diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel it was the best book I have ever read
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Horrible. U should get a rock and tape a note to it that says &quot;SUCK IT&quot;  and give it to the game!
B00846REIS|4.0|Great romance, keeps you coming back for more. Can't wait to  read the second and third books. Eva is a strong women!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I am not here to say that all other controllers terrible and only the genuine PS3 controller is the best.  For companies that invest the time effort and money in making a truly awesome PS3 compatible controller the true die hard gamers respond by buying what they sell.  Unfortunately cheap PS3 controllers are out here that barely work at all on PS3 systems.  Other cheap PS3 like controllers work for a while then break.  No use throwing good money away on a crappy second rate PS3 controller that will likely fail soon after you get it.  Sometimes a cheap item is cheap for a good reason, it lacks proven performance, quality and or it will not last.  I'm no video gamer since the only level I play is casual with the exception of Mass Effect the original one.  However even I know that when playing video games even the best gamer is only as good as his equipment.  I am not the best video gamer not even close but, having a Genuine PS3 Dual Shock controller does give me just enough of an edge to play and win some video games.  I wear out quality dual shock controllers to the tune of 2 every two years so thats about $80.00 for new controllers every two years.  Not much when you consider a newly released game is $60.00.  I have never gotten a bad PS3 Dual Shock controller but I have one humdinger of a lame controller from some other no name company given to me as a gift.  Its pretty it lights up and its crap if you try to play PS3 games with it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|It is not my favorite  I am not fast enough to keep away from the guys that chase the pacman
B005MMYBXI|4.0|A lot of blood and sex,  but, that what the Romans were like and the TV audience likes to see.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong Deluxe HD is one of my favorites.  I don't understand it sometimes because when you clik on matching tiles, they don't always disappear but keep plugging away as it is fun to play
B0043UB0EI|4.0|Too much blood and sex.  However, Romans did live this kind of life style.  Also, according to archeologists, most contests did not end in death, since they were an expensive item.  I know this is series is not history, but entainment for today's audience.  So sensationlism is reguired.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book was simply. Amazing. I cannot think of another book that I have enjoyed so immensely. I recommend this to everyone and anyone. Enjoy!
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Lots of blood and sex. but with the kicker that Spartacus makes his escape with other gladiators.  This follows more closely to history of this man.
0393327655|5.0|This is the second of the four \\"new atheists\\" books that I read, the first being Hitchens (yes, Harris wrote his first). While Hitch is a master at turning a phrase and finding le mot juste, I think Harris is just as brilliant of a thinker. He is not afraid to cover many areas of philosophy, epistemology, and science and is very knowledgable. He had not yet received his PHd when he wrote this one, but I can't imagine any reader being disappointed with The End of Faith. Do yourself a favor and don't simply buy the book, but search Youtube for his debates and lectures, always a treat.
0132350882|5.0|Martin's Clean Code is the Code Complete of the agile crowd.  Both of these books take the dominant language of their time and discuss strategies, tactics and idioms for using it effectively.  I suspect the ideal time to first read this is probably with about two years of professional experience.  However, anyone interested in how to write better code on a managed platform is sure to benefit.<br /><br />As a Principal Consultant with Magenic I interview a fair number of senior technical people for team lead roles.  A technical team lead needs to lead by example and to be able to produce clean code.  Doing so is sometimes a challenge and this book helps (a lot).  However, several people I respect have told me that Martin's style / attitude in this book was condescending.  While I'm willing to ignore style / attitude if the content is good enough this may be a barrier for some.  This one caveat aside, Clean Code is another of my Top 5 Recommended Books for Software Professionals.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Really good movie for a great price. :) I really wanted to get this for my best friend it's her favorite movie and I'd been dying to get it for her but I couldn't find it LITERALLY ANYWHERE, and if I did it ALWAYS some ridiculous price so I was so excited when I found it.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Go buy this now instead!  A great compilation with amazing quality.  A number of behind the scene discs which I've not yet gotten through, we've just watched all of the movies.  But am looking forward to watching those too.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the packaging.  It's hard to get the discs out and I fear scratching them every time I do.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like the book, and it is easier to read, so it is a good place for younger kids to start.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a lot better then the first I love all the new things they have added. I also like that its a game were Its not always making me fell like I need to spend money. to win a 100% free game is the best in my book.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I installed DropBox for a specific purpose:  My 91 year old Mom is having trouble reading her sheet music while playing the piano.  Being the techie that I am, I turned a 22&#34; monitor on end, and linked a tablet to it.  I scan music on my PC (or she does on her mac) into one of the drop box folders, and she has a ready access list of sheet music pieces to play.  We live in different cities, but everything appears wirelessly on al our machines.<br /><br />I also use MS's version of this cloud storage and it works well too.  Each has advantages.<br /><br />Pete A
B005K17RU0|5.0|Amazing that something this useful and downright elegant would be available for free!  As accurate as any service I've seen and loads up nicely -particularly the radar!
030758836X|5.0|It moved a little slowly, but the sinister pay-off was so worth it.  Especially where Amy is concerned, the characters are never who you expect them to be, and as parts of their masks begin to fall away, you see the true evil and brokenness that lies within.  It gave me chills, and if this is any indication of how great Gillian Flynn's novels are, I look forward to reading everything she publishes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game its so fun and cool. also I let my sister play and she thinks it fun and entertaining.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really liked that Sparks took on a twisted character. And that he wrote part of the book from Kevin's perspective. The book had the cliche \\"happily ever after\\" ending with a pretty cheesy \\"twist\\" at the end, but it was an easy read, hard to put down and definitively held my attention. I look forward to seeing the movie. I didn't cry over this book the way I did \\"Dear John\\" but it had way more depth than \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\".
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two books.  I read them back to back, staying up well past 3:00 A.M.,  three night's in a row.  I could not put the book down, I felt so drawn into Katniss, Peeta and Gale's lives.  Not the case with \\"Mockingjay.\\" I am struggling to get through this one.  Slow moving, the characters aren't pulling me in like the first two books did. I just may have to put this one down and forget about it.  Disapointing  read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  One thing I really like is if you can't afford to spend actual money on the game you can still get everything eventually because you can win acorns; you collect coins; and you get hearts just by playing.  Granted it is enormously faster if you buy acorns, but then again taking longer just means more hour and fun building your resources up slowly.  Plus a sense of accomplishment when you get enough to get the next thing you want.  Very addictive!  Got my hubby to install it on bis iPad and within 24 hours he was just as hooked as I had already been for weeks.  Hope others enjoy this game as much as hubby and I do!
0865478007|4.0|Dr Goldacre is an Epidemiologist, as am I. Or was. I changed fields because I saw examples, first hand, of what Dr Goldacre exposes in his book. Proper clinical trials are very difficult and expensive to do. You get obvious bad data in the raw observations, sample sizes are less than you want. Your power calculation on the sample size you have and the results you got suggest your P-value is bogus. You have to make judgements in some very grey areas. Every day.<br /><br />You work with research MDs that won't have a career if they don't get results. As an Epidemiologist you work part time on numerous small grants that don't add up to an adequate salary, so many of us do (did) statistical work for drug company trials. You don't get recommended for further consulting work if you are \\"overly rigorous\\", shall we say.<br /><br />In the late 70's new FDA requirements caused everyone to step up their game, but at increasing expense to doing trials. To contains costs, 30 years later, trials are now outsourced to about a half dozen separate specialist companies each doing one part of the study. A Clinical program management company, a data staging company, various companies that do the raw analysis (e.g. reading of CAT, MRI data), a company that prepares the results according to FDA submission requirements. All of them competing for the next contract, and competing on cost.<br /><br />You can see where this is going....<br /><br />I never witnessed any truly unethical behavior. There is no evil here. Personally, I chose to go into the software industry to avoid having to make daily ethical decisions. Dr. Goldacre wrote the book that many Epidemiologists could write. Hats off to him for actually doing it.<br /><br />This ex-Epidemiologist only takes generic drugs, because the only good clinical trial is done on the general public, and after it comes off-patent, it's been around long enough to know it's efficacy and side effects.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I thought this series was pretty good for being young adult... I would say that having the girl always running headlong into danger got to be a bit annoying at times - a little over played but all in all a good book...<br /><br />I find that I tend to skip over books with low ratings so I thought I better start doing my part and help books get read... :)
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is very similar to Mario & the levels are fun & well designed. After getting through the first few levels the difficulty level increases dramatically & I`m stuck on level 4-4. That's why I give this game an ok rating. I recommend this game to any old school Mario fans but prepare yourself for a challenge.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this book was great, hard to put down...<br /><br />I've been entering 'books like' 'Divergent and Hunger Games' trying to find similar stories... Ive gotten a few good ones in my cart and hope they dont disappoint. I find that I tend to skip over books with low ratings so I thought I better start doing my part and help books get read... :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's an awsome block world game with great  fun and you can mine for minerals and build a shelter before it is night because monsters come out and want to tare you're head off. They're not like a stupid little monster it's like a creepy thing of tarror comming after you. It's worth the 7 dollars. IT'S A PERFECT GAME! THANKS TO NOTCH, MOJANG, AND 4J STUDIOS! THANKS FOR ONE BIG HIT GAME!  You can get it on Xbox 360, PC, and any portable device!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|it's okay i don't really care for it, but it's really cool. Personally i like the first one better. hope that helps.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is really fun. you have to slide pudding blobs (looks more like jello)to make one big blob. I just wish it had more levels.
B00ADYYBFI|3.0|I love the songs on this album, however they are poor quality. They are muffled, crackled and distorted. It sounds like someone recorded then from their TV as opposed to in a studio. Hopefully volume 2 is better!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|In retirement I'm stretching myself to learn new things. I decided not to accept my usual &#34;I can't draw&#34; as my final decision and ordered this book.  Kistler has developed a system for teaching even the least right brained senior how to draw using basic shapes and techniques for shading. I'm only seven lessons into the thirty in this book and already I've been able to brag,&#34; Hey, I drew that!&#34; You will want to schedule time to do these lessons and do some practice, but it really only takes 20-30 minutes for each. If you really want to learn how to draw, order this book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Playing with this app and getting to know my horse is super fun and entertaining. I highly recommend this app to anyone interested in having a horse even if only as a pretend pet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|\\"  ok ok will I love dsubway surveyor. Now if just got 100,000 coins an awesome jackpot I have tricky and I am going to buy 500 jackpot
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Recommended: Buy the trilogy. Don't piecemeal it. Otherwise you will be right back here trying to buy the rest of the books.<br />Know this: It's not the best and brightest read ever, but it's addictive. It's also a story that I would have enjoyed as a teenager. Yes, you get the distinct impression it's not really aimed at those over drinking age. Oh well, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of it one bit. I liked it even more for that. Way better than the vampire series with bella and edward. Ugh.<br />Read before you watch the movie. Then you can hear the voices in your head, as they should have been said in the movie. It ups the enjoyment quotient.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I read the book to my boys and then we watched the movie.  My boys really liked the movie.  They want me to give it 4.5 stars.  Compared to the book, the movie was considerably different.  Neither the book or movie blew me away.  Good popcorn entertainment, though.  A few scenes could be scary for younger children.  I can't think of any objectionable language in the movie.
1400067820|5.0|This is brilliant. The world is far more complex than we like to pretend that it is, and he takes the elite to task on their fantasies. The central concept - that we need resilient structures, not fragile social fantasies, is absolutely correct. The problem is that resilient structures, being structures that adjust to the actual world, not the pretend academic/social worlds, are not politically correct and cannot be politically correct.

B009UWYFFK|5.0|I first heard of this movie a looooong time ago in an issue of Fangoria. It always found its way into the upcoming section but nothing wad ever said about it. This went on for yeats and I had no idea it was an animated film.<br />Anyway, enough of that. Animated movies these days try too hard in all of the wrong areas. Many seem to throw in long sections of drama and can leave the audience in tears. When you sit down as a family to watch a movie with your kids, do you really want them crying during the cartoon because the filmmakers decided to throw in too many tear-jerk moments? No. They're supposed to be a fun movie that brings laughable moments aplenty that can be enjoyed by everyone. Hotel Transylvania is exactly what it looks like. A cute family movie that has a great story and cast with loads and loads of laughs that can be enjoyed by all. I was pleasantly surprised and highly recommend this one. Its fun, its cute and I will say its one of the best animated films to come along in many years!<br /><br />Perfect viewing for you and your little monsters.<br /><br />- Charlie Morgan<br />amazon.com Best-Selling author of CAMPFIRES: A COLLECTION OF HORRORS and SOME OTHER TIME

0439813786|5.0|Selznick's illustrations are so finely wrought, they alone make the book worth it. But this was also the first long book my son tackled - the combination of a beautifully told tale, a charming protagonist, and perfect artwork - priceless!

B008ASGP3U|4.0|Some day, I hope Rebus has to solve a crime in sunny Portugal. It would be nice if someone donated a spiffy wardrobe to the cause and give him a smart phone.<br /><br /> Good story, super ensemble of characters and that godawful Scotland weather - but then Rebus fans know all this.<br /><br /> I'm just glad Rebus came out of retirement for a novel - may he do it soon again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book touched me profoundly as I have some experience with the bad places in life. The story accurately depicts how difficult it is to struggle with mental illness,and to come to the conclusion that there are very few silver linings in life..
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|You know as soon as Harold gets to the mail box with the letter that he's headed out of town. What a trip. I like road trip novels and this was especially good because Harold is on foot and frequently along the super highways so unsuited for walkers.<br /><br /> Wonderful story telling and - slight spoiler here - I'm glad Harold got home happier and, could it be, hornier?
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wonderful read. Couldn't put it down! It makes me NOT want to see the movie because there is no way a film could successfully capture the intricacies of this story.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|If you are a fan of Fifty Shades this music can inspire you to be creative. My favorite is the Flower Duet by Delibes.<br />Awe inspiring!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have loved all of Mitch Albom's  books, especially  \\"Five People You Meet In Heaven\\". This one is just as inspiring and as always, makes me reevaluate my life and the things I feel are so important. Everyday we carry on with our lives taking each day for granted. We think: Don't be late! What time is it? When are we going to get there? ......and so many other things that have to do with time, but so often we don't live in the moment. This book teaches you how important a moment can be. A moment can make all the difference.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book shows such an understanding of the depth of man's will to survive....and the depth of his capability to tell the story that will help him do so.  The myth guides us all, and maybe that is what has always guided us.  It has allowed us to stay within the boundaries of what we call sanity.  It is a tribute to the power of the positive even when we are acutely aware of the negative within.
B004123CO4|5.0|I've been a pretty loyal Neil Van Niekerk blog reader and when his two books on flash were released I really thought I was going to re-read the lifted material from his blog, accept it would have a cover on it.  To some extent that is true, but it doesn't read like his blog.  For folks that are interested in understanding the way to expose for both ambient and flash, Neil does a great job of doing so.  I'll leave you with this, it's very readable, it's correct, and easy enough to repeat what he's discussing.  Good luck!
0988262592|5.0|Amazing, this book answers some questions I've had for year regarding IT & IT process.  It really gives prospective on how IT should operate.

Some of the steps have been difficult, and there have been a few tough moments, but I sought visual help from You tube and was able to solve the problem. The book is well set out, with fantastic photos. The projects are all unique and inspiring. Thumbs up from me.
B009TSA7MA|5.0|Outstanding! What else can I say? Actually, quite a bit. Like anyone else posting a review, I am a long-time fan, yadda yadda yadda... but Temple of Rock was a revelation in Michael Schenker's playing. Too many fans, myself included, have been caught in the 1980s trap that we use to measure Schenker's performance and song writing. I rather liked his association with Robin McAuley, and find his neoclassical style to have evolved over the years. Sure, his battles with substances and family drama have been noted all too well in his disappearances and bad performances in the early-mid 2000s. I have a lot of his videos, and the one from Tokyo in the late 1990s stands out for his energy. Then, in 2004, a video shot in Poland shows a hairy, bloated Michael who can barely rock in time for the first five or six songs. It is dismaying to see him in a slump like that, but this new video shows his triumphant return, and then some....<br /><br />Schenker's return to form was gradual, however. I saw him in the summer of 2009 at the now demolished Angel's Road House in Yucaipa, CA, and while he put on a good show with Gary Barden at the vocal helm, he still lacked some extra energy. i don't know if it was the venue, but he hid behind his sunglasses. At times he revealed his friendliness toward the audience, encouraging people to strum the delay-engaged guitar for the lead in to \\"Lost Horizons.\\" Move forward to the fall of 2010, and Michael is firing on all cylinders again, and I noted that appreciatively at the Key Club in LA. Gary Barden even commented he thought it was their best show yet while on the 30th anniversary tour. The set list was heavy toward the Barden-era albums, with the usual selection of UFO tracks. Amazing energy, and I got to not only strum his guitar, but high five him. He was so energetic and moving about the stage non-stop, only stopping to drink water when Carmen Appice did his drum solo. I left wowed, and felt he was better than ever, kind of like Rush these days.<br /><br />2012 comes, and the long-awaited North American leg of the Temple of Rock tour finally came in the fall once again. I saw Schenker perform at the Key Club, definitely one of the better venues in my opinion, and man did he kick royal butt! My girlfriend had never been to a rock or metal show before, and halfway through the 1.5 hour set, she was using her phone to record him playing. Her favorite is \\"Rockbottom,\\" and truthfully, the version he played that night is much the same as documented on this fantastically recorded DVD. I have the Blu-Ray version. Schenker is throwing in the kitchen sink these days in terms of guitar techniques. he trills, shrills, thrills, and bends all at once it seems. Another tendency I noticed is that his ubiquitous wah wah pedal was barely touched, unlike the past. Perhaps it is because Marshall has modeled his heads to have a slightly half-cocked wah tone? That is the current speculation. He used the trusty black and white Dean V, as well as the new Ying/Yang model, the multi-colored V (equiped with DiMarzio Super Distortions)and the Strangers in the Night motif V for the UFO tunes. The set list opend with \\"Lovedrive\\" followed by \\"Another Piece of Meat,\\" \\"Save Yourself,\\" \\"Assault Attack,\\" \\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\\" \\"Into the Arena,\\" \\"Rock My Nights Away,\\", then a heavy UFO set ending with the aforementioned \\"Rockbottom\\" and \\"Doctor Doctor.\\" It is on that last track that my jaw hit the floor and I vocalized an astonished \\"wow\\"! Why? Schenker is using more tritone and octave fills, and it flows so naturally that old songs are refreshingly new again.<br /><br />Now to the main attraction. I was eager to see the old Scorpions members, Herman the German and Francis in action. Wayne Findlay, is, as many know, Schenker's longest-standing continuous band member. The vocal duties are largely handled by the thick-accented Doogie White, except for one track (sung by Michael Voss) called \\"Hanging On\\" from the new Temple of Rock album (yes, album, it is available on LP and it sounds incredible in that format). \\"Into the Arena\\" opens the show after the William Shatner voice over sketch. In the dark we see the band tensely awaiting their moment to hit the stage. The playlist then takes off into the Lovedrive reunion. Not sequentially, mind you, but they played \\"Lovedrive,\\" \\"Another piece of Meat,\\" \\"Coast to Coast,\\" a lovely instrumental, then, late in the encore section, surprise renditions of \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" and \\"Blackout,\\" plus, the wonderful \\"Holiday.\\" Those are worth the cost of the video alone.<br /><br />The classic Schenker tunes are spread out, and the vocals of Doogie White, as noted by another reviewer, seem to mash poorly with the harmony. The lyrics get slurred occasionally, whether from accent or uncertainty, it is hard to guess. His high range is not really there, but he does put in an energetic performance, and engaged the crowd well. He is a funny guy though, and I think adds an element of youth, along with the fantastic Wayne Findley. The latter really seared the leads of \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane.\\" I was previously aware of his lead-playing talents from the aforementioned 2004 video where he convincingly shreds the lead for \\"Arachnophobia.\\" As the rhythm guitarist and keyboard player, he is a fine replacement for UFO's Paul Raymond.<br /><br />Highlights? Well, I watched the DVD twice, losing much sleep. The extra bonus section shows an outdoor show excerpts from London, and the video concludes with backstage pre-concert prep. You see the band moments before they hit the stage, thereby completing an end-first editing format. The soundcheck was also a nice glimpse of how Schenker prepares, and what irritates him with sound issues. Those in the know may spot at least two Dunlop Volume Pedals onstage. In Schenker's words, those are for him to manipulate to increase the volume in the monitors, and are not a part of his rig.<br /><br />I think the mix of old and new was well balanced here, and as Schenker notes in the booklet, the past was marked by Discovery with the Scorpions and UFO, experimentation with MSG, and now, the walls of the proverbial Temple of Rock are erected. His role is duly noted. Even Marshall gave him the \\"11\\" award a year or so ago, symbolizing the hard-living lifestyle of rock and roll. He earned it, that's for sure. What really struke me, not only in this video, but seeing him twice in LA and again in Corona, CA, is Michael's delight in playing. He is especially gracious to the crowds in intimate settings, such as clubs, and still acknowledges the crowd in larger venues, as depicted in this Tilburg, Netherlands show. Speaking of Marshall, three of his four cabinets are upside down, part of his sense of humor. While a wall of Marshall stacks looks impressive, he only uses one miked stack for any performance these days. Schenker is a BIG believer in backup, and the second head and cabinets are just that. He also doubles up on his Boss Chorus and Digital Delay pedals. Only minor setting differences there in the duplicates, and the much-needed TU3 Tuner. His wah of choice is the awesome Dimebag Wah from Hell model by Dunlop (get it, it is the best one they make). His pick preference is the Dunlop .60 nylon, and he swears by 9s (a reference to string gauge for non-guitarists). It is said, but unverified, that he prefers Celestion \\"Greenbacks\\" in his 4x12 cabinets. I, for one, would love to know what tubes his tech puts in those heads because his tone is damn-near perfect, and the apparent differences in his various Vs also can be heard in the extremely well recorded video.<br /><br />I think fans will enjoy Schenker's liberties with the old songs, after all, you cannot live in the past and play the same exact solos you did in 1982. I think his musical journey is continuing, not the unfortunately titled review here that used the phrase \\"swan song.\\" Schenker is going to keep putting out music, he hasexpressed interest in recording a blues rock album, and perhaps we shall be treated to another UFO reunion? Speaking of UFO, Pete Way makes an appearance on \\"Doctor Doctor\\" in London, and man does he look rough. That pasty, bloated Ozzish, English thing. Kind of like the guys in Iron Maiden, they rocked hard, and evidently played harder. Nonetheless, is was good to see him.<br /><br />Is this video perfect? Of course not, but it does advance forward in Michael Schenker's extensive discography his pure talent, and the redemption that follows recovery.

B005LAIGN2|4.0|I liked the movie and feel it is a story that needs to be told of the heroic service that was performed by Negro Pilots in World War 11. I would recommend it to war movie fans.

B0072GPQNG|4.0|I liked the movie very much although it had a sad theme and would recommend it to war movie fans.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I knew nothing about it except that it had been made into a movie. I just assumed it would be an easy read. The story tugs at your heart & makes you appreciate the courage of the characters.  I believe we all have experienced despair that made us feel perhaps a bit mentally ill for a time so identifying with the emotions was easy. The character's triumph at the end is a testament to the power of true friendship & love. Read the book & experience a remarkable journey.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I would recommend anyone wanting to watch individual episodes at their convenience, this is the way to go!  But be aware, you will get spoiled being able to go straight to the next episode and not have to wait a full week to see what is going to happen next!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|First of all I am a huge Family Guy and American Dad fan. I really like Seth McFarland's comedy. That being said, this movie fell really short for me. It's as if he did a rough draft of the script one afternoon and they greenlit the project and never did a rewrite. I'm starting to think that while Mr. McFarland can come up with some great ideas he still needs his room of writers to hash them out for him. Normally I find Marky Mark and Mela Cunis quite funny but they were also very flat in this movie. I don't know what all the hype is about. I like fart jokes but I like good fart jokes. This movie felt like a rough rough draft of what could have been something great. Unfortunately it killed at the box office so we probably see something very similar soon. If there is a Ted 2 I may have to write my congressman.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I just finished the first workout immediately after a hard jog.  I really like how she does circuits, but she puts WAY too much emphasis on the shoulders.  A person should focus on the deltoids twice a week max.  I also take muay Thai three times a week and Brazilian jiu jitsu twice a week, and I simply wanted to add a great cardio and abs workout to my regimen. I wish she did 3 min cardio and 2 min strength training instead of the reverse. I was very unimpressed with the cardio.  I wasn't even breathing hard.  So far, I am liking Billy Blanks Boot Camp MUCH better.  I guess this would be a good workout for those who are not already active, though...
B008HT4FUW|3.0|Just received season 3 in the mail. In hindsight the quality of this particular blu-ray is poor. It is somewhat dark and grainy. I am glad to own it because I enjoy the content of the show but now wish I had purchased the seasons out separately. You live you learn I suppose.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Truely enjoyed reading this book. A peak into what soldiers went through in Iraq. Good perspective from his wife as well. RIP Chris and Chad. True American Heroes.
1423136802|5.0|If you have kids who want more of the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; type of book, this book will suffice.  It is similar in tone, but not as intricate as Rowling's series.  Lots of clever plot twists and references to ancient Greek lore.  Adults can enjoy sharing in the adventure, too.

Well, a CD was not something our daughter had thought to request, but I knew she would love it--and I was right! She was thrilled to get this, and she can listen to it when a DVD player is not nearby, so that is a plus.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|An excellently written book, which holds your interest from the beginning to the end.  The characters are developed in a way that makes one really care about them. I really loved this book.
B004JK61K0|1.0|This app also did not work.  One more attempt to get the Kindle to work failed.  What a piece of junk this Kindle is!  Two weeks and still no working e-mail.  Great support too! One rep failed to call as promised and another with an accent so heavy that I kept asking him to slow down his speech just hung up on me.  The next rep was unable to get me connected on either this method or the regular, still waiting for another &#34;expert&#34; to call me back.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this product because you must take the Kindle out of the cover/sleeve to use it.  I prefer the cover that stays on while you use it.  I did like the two-toned coloring, but I miss the ease of unzipping and just turning on the machine when I want to use it.
0143119680|4.0|Loved it!  The author seems very intelligent and that comes across in the writing.  I loved the historical references and knowledge, and the descriptions of Oxford, where much of the book takes place.  The way she stimulated all of your senses with the descriptions, was genius.  Smell, emotion, visual, my imagination was peaked!<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone wanting a break from \\"reality\\" and to dive into a well-written, intriguing story.<br /><br />Only thumb down was the ending seemed blander to me than the rest of the book.  Perhaps too much information, too many details? But this is so minor, and the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />All in all,  excellent book and provided a lot of enjoyment.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Exactly as described, shipped promptly & well packaged.  The only thing left out of the description is that the box-set cover art is in plastic 3-D.  This is a great bargain!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A friend recommended this book and she was dead on. I experienced so look many emotions!  Well done! I will recommend this to anyone.
0553386794|5.0|Tolkien set the bar very high with Lord of the Rings. I found most books in the Fantasy genre to pale by comparison, until I read Game of Thrones. It is beautifully written and crafted, a masterpiece of story-telling, and George Martin's control of his character development and plot lines is masterful indeed, considering how many of them there are. I have since watched the TV series and love that it sticks to the book so well. Why wouldn't it? All the work has been done in the book - the characters, locations and dialogue. Just move it on across to the screenplay. I'm now rereading Game of Thrones and watching each TV episode as I finish the relative section of the book. What a treat!
B00A4VGUIG|5.0|I was at first hesitant to buy this because I didn't like Tivola's other games, and I didn't like that there were no reviews for me to look at. I bought it anyway and loved it. The game was super duper fun! The dolphins are cute and interactive, and really fun to take care of. The people on the island are really fun to talk to as well. I haven't finished it yet, but there is a mystery surrounding the whole pirate story. You can go boating with the dolphins and it's super fun. You also can train the dolphins by making different swiping patters on your screen. All-in-all, I think you should really buy it. It's fun with the dolphins, but it's even more fun with the mystery sorounding the Island of Tirimoa
0345803485|1.0|I read this because of all the hype. Pity. It wasn't worth all that hype! It reads like a naive teenager's idea of erotica. The character of Ana is simply not believable, Christian is a bore, and the situations have all been written before - but better. Ana never seems to get past the \\"what am I doing here!\\" stage until the last few pages. What took her so long! Christian is two dimensional to the point of screaming (me, not him). The only thing it had going for it was the clever marketing. It's Mills & Boon on steroids. I regret wasting my money on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so much fun and it similar to the original temple run but yet at the same time is different from the original.

B000W93CHC|5.0|World Without End was an outstanding follow up to The Pillars of the Earth.  It occasionally conjured up images of the characters we became so familiar with, without depending on them.  This book definitely stands on its own merit and makes me want to learn about the ancestors of Caris and Merthin as well.  I will certainly be looking for more of this style of writing from Ken Follett.

If I have more time than I just do two 20 minute workouts or all three if I have that much time. One thing I really don't like is that every time you do the video, you have to begin with her talking for five minutes, the dvd doesn't allow you to skip, fast forward or move to another section of the video until you hear her big mouth about how she is so fit and you gotta bring it yada yada yada.....

I looked into it on George R.R. Martin's website, and found that European publishers break all of his books into two points. This is not the case with this edition.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|After reading a lot of reviews of this book, I wasn't really sure I would like it. All everyone was saying was that Bella n Edward lost their innocence. To me that's what made it even better.. they got a life every one wants. Immoral or not they found happiness and made a family.

B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Mason's honest and poignant memoir of his time as a helicopter pilot during the Viet Nam War provides tremendous perspective from a very personal point of view, not only of how the conflict was pursued, but also the effect on the individuals involved.  At the same time, it is a veritable primer on the art and science of flying a helicopter.

1426209584|5.0|I chose this book because it offered an insightful exploration - and explanation - of evolution.  The photographs are a work of love over 8 years of strenuous and creative exploration by the two authors.  The magnificent beauty of the results is both gratifying and educational.  Unique and well informed, the book continues to provide me with many occasions to revisit it.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|My interest in this book was piqued by the understanding it continues to provide me with my own brain training.  Aware that I could find myself at any time facing rehabilitation from injury or organic failures it is important for me to maintain good fitness and continued training and education.  The story of the author's self-care following a massive, potentially fatal stoke is inspiring and powerful - I first used a library copy and could only read a few pages at a time.  Even more to my mind was the value of the teachings of how she managed to come back to full capacity - over 8 years - and productive teaching was tremendously helpful - so much so, that I did what I have often been tempted to do but never did - I bought 10 copies - one for each member of my family and one for each of the five fitness teachers I work with every week at my local fitness center.

When she isn't listening to the music, she's humming &#34;Friend of the Devil&#34; to herself.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|I am always thrilled when I find a new series that captivates me, and The Iron Druid Chronicles is the latest in this group. With five books (six if you count book 4.5) already out and four more to come, it promises high level entertainment for a long time to come. The part that scares me is that I almost missed out on it. The book starts really well, engaging the reader not with action but with an interesting premise; a druid that is over two-thousand years old and looks like a twenty-one-year-old living in Arizona and hiding from some powerful enemies. The main problem is that after a couple of nice opening chapters, the book gets into a lull that lasts 5-6 chapters. It is pretty boring and confusing, and I was asking myself if maybe I should give up and jump to a different book. Gladly I didn't, because right there and then things picked up again, and the 80% remaining was truly outstanding, packed with action, humor and a super interesting magic / fighting system.<br /><br />There are a large variety of fantastic characters in this series, including gods, druids, witches, fairies, vampires, werewolves and animals that can communicate telepathically. Not bad, huh? Especially when it all works so well together and when the abilities, weaknesses and interactions among these are so well thought-out. I also have to say that one of the stars of the show is the Morrigan, a god of death that is both scary and alluring at the same time. but maybe the one that steals the show together with Atticus, the main character, is Oberon, his Irish wolfhound. The telepathic conversations between them are a treat and deliver a good portion of the fine humor found in this novel.<br /><br />Of course, the cast of characters would not be complete without a girl, and don't despair, there is one, who is as mysterious as she is charming. All this sets up a start to this series that promises greatness and I hope I don't get disappointed by future installments.<br /><br />In the kindle edition there are two short stories included at the end. When you finish the novel there is a chapter with a preview of \\"Hexed\\" book number two of the series. I usually don't read this previews, and if you are like me, make sure to keep going past it to reach the bonus stories. These are events that happened before the fist novel, and are thoroughly entertaining, one of them dealing with gnomes and the other one with witches. If you are not getting the kindle version and instead go for a paper copy, you can get the first bonus story from the author's website for free, so make sure to do so.ion there are two short stories included at the end.

1476719071|5.0|So it seems that this book is either a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" kind of book. I read so many terrible reviews knocking the relationship because of \\"abuse.\\" I was expecting Travis to be very unlikable, and honestly I was expecting the relationship to be a lot worse than it was. Along with all of the negative reviews, I also saw a lot of really great reviews for Beautiful Disaster. In this case, I am going to have to agree with the great review people, because I loved every single second of Beautiful Disaster. I stayed up all night reading this book, and I do not regret an ounce of the sleep I lost.<br /><br />The relationship between Abby and Travis really is a beautiful disaster. Both of the characters have rough pasts and have issues because of that past. While it makes their relationship crazy at times, it also makes them perfect for each other. They understand each other in a way that no one else can. Their issues and past make them better for each other. Their relationship reminds me of a hurricane, but in a good way.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of bad talk out there about Travis, but I honestly thought he was more desperate than anything. Does he get jealous and controlling? Yes. Does he do this simply to control Abby? No. He acts the way he does because he is desperate, not just because he simply wants to control her. That does not make the way he acted okay, but it also makes it understandable. Travis was in love with Abby and was willing to do anything to be with her. He was not perfect and made mistakes, but I thought he always had Abby's best interest at heart.<br /><br />Honestly I thought that Abby was worse than Travis. She messed with Travis' head for the majority of the book. She would break up with him, but then get mad at him for being with other girls. She jerked him back and forth for a lot of the book and that wasn't very fair to him. She wasn't doing this intentionally, she had her reasons, but she still hurt him a lot. My point is that Abby andTravis both behaved crazy because they loved each other.<br /><br />Travis and Abby do not have the healthiest relationship in the world, but they try to make it work. They are simply making the best with the cards they were dealt. In real life would I put up with Travis? No. However, this is a book and I enjoyed the story. I enjoyed watching Travis and Abby work through their respective issues and try to makes things work. I loved the happy moments and hated the sad, but together I just loved it all. I completely understand why some people do not like this book; it is not a book for everyone. However, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a beautifully written story that tugs at your heartstrings. It will make your heart hurt and then have you smiling like a little kid. Travis and Abby have some incredibly sweet moments, but they also have some heartbreaking ones. I loved that the relationship was built on friendship. At the core of everything between Abby and Travis, they are simply best friends. I think some of my favorite moments came when they were just goofing off as friends. They really know everything about each other and that is because they are not just a couple but each other's best friend. Also, I simply loved that Travis called Abby Pigeon or Pidge. I don't really know why I loved it; I simply thought it was funny. It made me think of Lady and the Tramp, and I am a Disney fanatic.<br /><br />All in all, I am a huge fan of Beautiful Disaster. It has skyrocketed its way on to my favorite's shelf. I have yet to be disappointed by anything Jamie McGuire has written and I am eagerly anticipating Walking Disaster.<br /><br />*I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|This game did very entertaining. When I purchased it I thought that the three year old boy that I babysit would like it but his older sister likes it better .
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book. Better than the first...I love this book. Can't wait for Travis' version, Walking Disaster. Great writing, awesome love story, fun characters, twists and turns. Great read.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Despite the overly expansive vocabulary words and untimely transitions in the writing the book is worth reading. You become enticed in the characters.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I still like the Stallone Dredd better.  This Dredd is ok, the action is great, but the acting . . . well, for as bad as Stallone was, he was still better than this.

B008D28HYS|4.0|Very good game with a couple of improvements it would be great. 1) the color boxes should be movable to the side, because many times they overlap the board and it's a pain to fill in those bottom left boxes. (can add a button on the top to switch them to side or bottom) 2) the timer before it recognizes the long press should be ADJUSTABLE or at least he very least greatly reduced (by at least half the time) 3) make the circle smaller after a long press (nitpicking at this point) Otherwise, these puzzles are indeed quite challenging, and that is enjoyable. Great game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loooooooooooooove. it so much. it is great love it love it love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so so much fantastic so fantastic who wouldn't want to buy this app it is amazingly. AWESOME AHHHH LOL

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel delivered. His performance was excellent. This is acting and Denzel did a superlative job of being a convincing airline pilot and a raving alcoholic. After this film I look forward to seeing Denzel in more upcoming films, the guy really is talented.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Maybe the story is not completely historically accurate, but this movie is a work of art. The mood, the motion, the emotions, every part of it gets you in.  Definitely recommend to action-comic-heroic-entertaining movie fans.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|I enjoy both movies, but like Expendables 2 the best.  Great action and Jean-Claude Van Damme makes an amazing villain.  It's clear he put a lot of thought into his character performance.  I wish they would bring him back in the next one.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|While at times I was angry and/or disappointed with Cheryl's choices, I wanted her to succeed. Her struggle became my struggle. I was surprised by her experiences with drugs and sex.  She seemed to have no regard for her body. I finished the book several days ago and I miss Cheryl's company.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book...wish there was more of an ending...leaves us hanging. I truly enjoyed the entire trilogy. I guess now, I have to wait for the movies.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a pretty good game with some challenging puzzles.  I really liked the fact that you could choose to play dominoes instead of the HOG.  I'm not sure it was worth $4.99 for the full game though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is one of the funest games I have played in a long time it is better then the first temple run.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well I have seen the trailers for the movie....which I will not see because there is no way it could measure up to the book. This is on my Kindle Paper White. Nicolas Sparks is a great story teller. Highly recommend this novel
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much easier than old temple run, but with new twist and turns at every corner! I was surprised at the character selection that they added.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So cool my sis me and friends think its wowerful it ma les me really g<br />Happy that it was ad free and the game was also free
B001FB5634|5.0|Cormac McCarthy's original novel is one that can never be fully captured on film; however, the movie version of THE ROAD comes as close as it possibly can. While the directors remained largely faithful to the events in the novel, interestingly enough, with just a bit more on the cannibalistic \\"bad people,\\" the film comes off as something more in the realm of horror than simple speculative fiction. Stunningly bleak cinematography, with excellent use of flashbacks to better times. Fine, fine acting by Viggo Mortenssen and virtually all of the supporting cast. Best of all is Kodi Smit-McPhee as \\"the Boy.\\"<br /><br />Like the novel, the movie is bleak, sobering, and sadly uplifting. Regardless of  what catastrophic event (nuclear exchange? meterorite?) brought about its ravaged world, \\"The Road\\" leaves you thinking, \\"This is what it would really be like.\\"
B009KUWWW0|5.0|As a continuation of 'The Pillars of the Earth&#34;, this is great. It start some 150+ years later and shows how English society has moved (or not). I like the way he weaves inventions/problem solving into his plot to show how humankind moves forward to advance our lives. Great reading
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider is a CHALLENGE with every deal!  (I do NOT do the &#34;winning deal&#34; category).  Instead of using the &#34;automatic send card&#34; I find it better to &#34;move&#34; the cards myself because it often sends them to a pile other than the one I want it to go to.  I really enjoy this game of Solitaire!

B0068MNO4S|2.0|\\"Anonymous\\" tackles the controversy surrounding \\"Shakespeare authorship question.\\" Google the phrase and you will find something interesting about the long history of this argument - Did William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon really write all the poems and dramas accredited to him?<br /><br />The film begins with a modern-day theater where Derek Jacobi introducing a \\"play\\" or the main part of the film, in which the 17th century playwright Ben Jonson (Sebastian Armesto) is being chased by the army of Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury (Edward Hogg) looking for certain manuscripts. Then starts a flashback, and then another. The muddled narrative keeps us busy following what is going on. In short, Shakespeare is, according to \\"Anonymous,\\" is only a \\"front.\\"<br /><br />Whether you believe Shakespeare was really a \\"fraud\\" (as the film's poster says) or not, there is one thing you are certain of. Director Roland Emmerich is best known for his bombastic visual style in action-packed disaster films, and I like \\"Independence Day\\" for its simple storytelling and tongue-in-cheek humor, but considering the complex narrative structure of \\"Anonymous,\\" he is not the right choice.<br /><br />\\"Anonymous,\\" visually impressive as it is, with muddy streets of London and Lisy Christl's Oscar nominated costume design, storytelling is complicated more than necessary. As a thriller or a drama \\"Anonymous\\" simply lacks the slick narrative that is necessary to draw the viewers into the film's conspiracy-filled world.<br /><br />As many online reviewers have already pointed out, there are so many departures from fact in the film (the most notable being the one about the cause of dramatist Christopher Marlowe's death). I know the historical accuracy isn't the most important thing in this political thriller, and I also know Hollywood studios often do this for dramatic effect. But what dramatic effect?<br /><br />\\"Anonymous\\" takes itself so seriously, adding a Greek tragedy touch to the convoluted storyline.

B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Interesting premise but i found myself being bored at parts of it.  Decent ending though and i did buy the kid as Bruce Willis for the most part much more than i thought i would
B009X00E18|3.0|It's a little on the flimsy side.  But I do like the enclosed stylus that you store in the earphone plug-in hole.  It is sometimes hard to stand alone
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I thought they had a monumental task of outdoing the great 80's version.  I think that is why many people didn't like it but rating it on it's own as an action movie i would give it the 4 stars.  3 and a half if that was available
B007REV4YI|3.0|The Film is great, but my gripe is about the lack of a Steelbook exclusive here in the US, unlike in Germany, France and the UK.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I Love this game, it is addicting to play. Would recommend it to anyone who loves a good card game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautifully written. This book is a wonderful expression of hope and love. This is a must read for anyone wanting to fall in love with love.

0345522478|5.0|From the first paragraph, Mr Hearne grabs you with his biting sense of humor. His intro is great, and it only gets better from there! My friends told me I wouldn't leave them alone til they had read the book also & then they couldn't stop talking about the books!! He take you for a stroll through Irish history and myth bringing them alive. He coaxes you to take a look at the historical road less traveled and enjoy every minute of it!! It's a great read for history buffs, mythology lovers, and anyone that loves books that is very hard to set down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although pocket edition is left at the alpha stage, it will update, until it is similar to present minecraft. (pc) I say similar because new items or blocks are added, for example stone cutter (0.61) which is not a existing block in pc or x-box edition.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|He is the scariest villian I've ever seen in movies.  Great movie!  A plot you can even follow.  Wanted to see it in the theater again.

B00993FEUK|5.0|I absolutely love this move! I saw it twice in the theater when it was first released, so I had to buy it once it was out on DVD/Blu-ray. It's a fantastically done kids &#34;horror&#34; movie that adults will love! I watch it frequently and it never gets old! Nothing too scary for the little ones so it's a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's actually quite addicting.I play it every day and I never get tired of it. I love the bright lights and colors and all the different levels.I love it.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I've read some of the reviews for Conan the Barbarian, and have come to the conclusion that some of these guys really need to get out of their parents basements, get real jobs and lighten up.  An entire dialog breakdown, sequence of events and previous story comparison is a little much!<br /><br />Its a remake, pure and simple.  There really isn't anything special about this movie that will make it stands out.  Some of the stunts are reminiscent of Indiana Jones and National Treasure.<br /><br />Most of the acting is B rated at best, dialog is flat, some of the story flow is dis-jointed and most of the action scenes are ho-hum, much like the rest of the movie.  I don't think its bad for what it is.  I am glad that I didn't spend the money and a Friday night at the movies to see this.<br /><br />Its good background noise, not much too it and having seen it once, I can't really brag on it.
B008220D5K|3.0|Judd Apatow's movies are funniest when their characters riff together and create their own weird space through banter and shared delusions. Think of Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen taunting each other while playing video games in \\"40-Year-Old Virgin\\". But in \\"This is 40\\", Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann's characters are just plain annoying.<br /><br />Directing his own wife was not a good idea for Apatow: it's so clearly a perk of great financial success and of the movie studio letting him do whatever he wants. Yay him. But Apatow has lost all critical distance. I'm sure in real life Leslie Mann is incredibly sexy, funny and lovable, and I would be bowled over by how adorable she is. But she is on screen for way too long here, and it's almost painful. With its blend of baby talk and grown-up bitchiness, Mann's voice grates after a while: a little goes a long way, but here we're given a non-stop dose -- and only because the director is her husband who cannot see that less is more.<br /><br />And who has the patience for these self-involved characters? The supposedly funny moments struck me as simply obnoxious, like the scene when the daughters want to leave for school but Leslie Mann's character, determined to prove her sexiness, is intent on giving oral sex to Paul Rudd and shrieks at the girls through the locked door. Really? How many levels of ickiness and unbelievability does that one scene span? And when Leslie Mann tears into a 7th grader for having insulted her daughter online: you almost want to call Child Services. And when Melissa McCarthy, as the boy's mother, lights into the couple in the principal's office, whose side can you possibly take? Apparently no one's! So where does that leave the viewer?  When the movie shifts to the absurd banter of Jason Segal or Lena Dunham riffing as an employee of Paul Rudd's record label, you exhale with relief, the way you do when you leave a crummy party and are thrilled just to be out and about and away from those people.<br /><br/>I'm amazed by the number of people who seem to like this movie. I feel a bit alienated reading these raves on Amazon. Am I that much of a loner in my tastes? So be it. I am over 40, and maybe I am now over Judd Apatow, too.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great concert, these guys have really aged but still can play their a**es off!!! I can't beleive how tight they still are after all these years! Jason Bonham nailed his Dad's parts plus!
B000B8QG22|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years, and saw a clip of Robin on the Johnny Carson show and they were promoting this film.  Just inspired me to get it and it's still a great story.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Great story, took a little while to get started, but really enjoyed it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason, instead of sticking all the backstory in the beginning I felt it probably could have been interspersed.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was a tough one as far as the HO scenes went.  I hit a lot by accident and I used the hint button  more than usual.  I wouldn't recommend for the faint-hearted!  Graphics, music ok.  The plot seemed kinda vague. Has some mini-games with skip option available.  Finished in a long evening. Played beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  I prefer more mini-games than HO and I think it could have been longer for the price,  thus 3 stars from me. If you're a hard-core HO fan, you'll really enjoy this.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Simply beautiful.  Love, not only, his voice and song selections, but the orchestration as well.  Wouldn't have thought it possible, but, Josh's voice has only gotten better over the years.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a challenging and addicting game. A good way to pass some time and use your brain as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always enjoyed this game Now I can enjoy it as I travel or just to use on the beach. It's very clever and I would recommend it to everyone.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|This was a gift for my hubby! He watches it EVERYTIME it comes on tv , now he can watch it ,uninteruppted!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg!! ithis game is sooo awesome !! my name is not beauty rodreguz .some times i get confused when i need to move my tablet....awesome!!!!!!.......
B00005ATZT|5.0|A gift for my husband to watch it uninterrupted with no commercials. He loves this movie and was surprised when he opened the gift.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely three books I will be reading again, as I couldn't put them down! The third book was by far my favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG this game is awesome just like temple run but better  and very good for little kids ......it is MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!13 ;)
1400064287|5.0|Good. This is an amazing book. Word word word word word word word word word word word word word word.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game stinks. I love the original game. this one sucks. When I try to turn it take 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to turn and during those 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 he dies. Also it is very boring and nothing like the first. There is only one demon. There are 3 demons in the original. :/
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|ONE OF STEVES BEST MOVIES HE WAS MAGNIFICENT TOO BAD HE DIED SO ERLY HE WAS SOME POWERFUL<br />AND GOOD
B0063GORYU|2.0|I found this edition difficult to get into.  I purchased another which is more to my liking.  Different strokes for different folks!
B000P5FH3K|5.0|IT IS A VERY POWERFUL MOVIE AND JOHN GRISHAMS BOOKS THEY MAKE IT TO MOVIE AND PEOPLE LIKE THEM<br />TOO
B007N8RULO|3.0|Perhaps I am not following directions well, but I find that the game is not as engaging when played in real life.
0763634417|3.0|First off, my daughter has loved this book since the first reading. It is one of the few books (along with Wow Ocean and anything Elmo) that she will sit through from cover to cover at her age (she was 18 months old when I first read this to her). The story itself is 5 stars, but I wanted to post a review about the Candlewick version of this book since I was not sure whether to buy the regular hardcover version of this book or the Candlewick version.<br /><br />The book that comes with the Candlewick version is very small in size. I was hoping that it would be in the larger size that the regular hardcover version comes in because the gorgeous color illustrations look so engaging in the larger size. The Candlewick book is mini-sized by comparison. The dimensions of the Candlewick version seemed to match the dimensions of the regular hardcover format in the product description, but the packaging (I.e the sticker sheet and extras) is what makes up the height and width. So you might be surprised or disappointed in the size of the book as I was when you order this version. I probably would have been delighted with this if I hadn't already borrowed the large hardcover version of this book from the library. Somehow the mini-sized pages of the Candlewick version takes away from the impact of the colorful illustrations. The cute stickers, sticker page, and the DVD esp. are very nice extras to have with the book, but (ugh) I ended up spending more $ and ordered the regular hardcover book. I plan to give this mini book away as a stocking stuffer gift.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I chose this backpack because of it's style and craftsmanship.  I like that it is well made and accommodate my 17inch laptop and so many other things.  I also have another one like it, a little bit smaller and I LOVE IT!  I have been using it for over 6 years.  Still in great shape!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved the imagery created by the author, the characters felt alive and very real.  The description of each circus tent was detailed that the reader can easily envision it, heightening the overall reading experience.  One of the best books I've read and definitely for recommendation to those who are thinking of reading it.
B009PDO946|5.0|This is my first blu ray disc and I am quite pleased with the quality of the sound and picture.  One of my favorite things is watching the New Years concert on Jan 1.  This disc has the straight up concert without the annoying puff pieces shown on PBS.  The dance sequences are in the &#34;extra features&#34; and there is a very nice short film featuring Austrian landscapes and some small groups from the orchestra performing some fun music.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The game was challenging but still enjoyable.  The game seemed a bit short unfortunately.  If it had been longer I would've given the game a 5 star rating.
B00932AA5G|5.0|If I have to watch a foreign movie, for the effort of reading the subtitles, it had better be good. This movie, in fact, exceeded my expectations! This is truly a thriller. The cinematography is wonderful and the picture clarity in HD is outstanding especially when it is brand new \\"2012\\" movie.<br /><br />I am so happy that it is available on Amazon Prime for free. Even if it were not, I would have paid to rent it! Yeah, that's how good it is!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I heard Semi-Automatic by Twenty One Pilots the other day and just had to find more of their music. Since I bought this album I have probably listened to each song on it 50 times. The songs don't seem to get old and they are very enjoyable. I'm usually into music like Three Doors Down, Paramore, and Avenged Sevenfold, so I was really suprised when I heard this and liked it so much. This may just be my best purchase of 2013 thus far!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I love everything Josh Groban!  I have all his CD's and look forward to a new one coming out.  All That Echoes did not disappoint.
0062238868|5.0|I purchased this book the day after I heard Chris Kyle had passed away as a way to HONOR a man who fought for our country and who supported the 2nd Amendment. It's unfornate that he served 4 terms of duty and had to come home and be gunned down by a man who clearly suffered from PTSD and needed mental health to address his issues. May GOD BLESS CHRIS KYLE AND HIS FAMILY. REST IN PEACE.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I was expecting more from this movie.  I think they used special effects in place of a good story and hopped you would be happy with that.  The other problem I had with this was the digital copy showed in iTunes and all I needed was the code to download it, but the code they included doesn't work.  So no digital copy after all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I work a lot of night shifts and cute games like this one keeps me awake until 6 in the morning. Thanks for coming up with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5+ Stars....I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put the book down, it kept my interest the intire time.  I found myself during the day thinking about what was going to happen next.  I couldn't wait to get home to continue reading.  I would definetely recommend.
0345803507|5.0|Everything about my order, delivery and conditition of the book was excellent, I was very please to see my book looked -\\"0% new
B00AECDDYY|4.0|I have a great time playing this game. Some have complained that it takes too long to load but that is a minor inconvenience. Overall this is a fun way to waste some time. It is a good strategy game and one of the best I've seen for a handheld device in a long time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down, it was way too good. One of the best he has written.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Due to Dr. Alexander's background, and if you're a believer in life after death (heaven), this book definitely provides substantial reason to believe individuals have actually come back from the dead after a short visit in heaven. As some of the other reviewers stated, it would have been nice to hear more details pertaining to heaven, but it sounds as if heaven is too grand for explanation with mortal words.<br /><br />I found it to be an enjoyable, fascinating read, and a good subject of conversation for further exploration.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to others.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This one like all of Ken Follett's stories is a good one. The story follows along nicely from the first in the Trilogy. Aloha, from Honolulu.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game i love  it makes me think  as i try to save the<br />coins  you also get prizes as you play
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A heart felt THANKS goes out to Chris for his sacrifice so that I can live in peace! I fly my flag proudly because of people like Chris. Proud of you Chris.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Just so good. Just so, so, so incredibly good. This book sets a very high mark for fantasy novels across the genre.  An ironic study of the life of Kvothe, both a hero and a villain in this incredibly rich, detailed novel.  Read it. No, seriously, read it.
0062127241|4.0|Who I Am, by Pete Townshend feels like an exploration of the man rummaging through the closet of himself, finding interesting bits and pieces that he can use creatively and allowing us to watch the process.  It will be left for time to tell if this is the first step in exploring the transition of Pete the rocker to Pete the writer.  I was left with the feeling that there were a lot more tales to tell.  Townshend's story is well written, but not fast moving, it is honest, but not really telling, sort of like those people who entertain wearing body socks, they look naked on the screen, but actually they aren't.  The history of the period is well covered, but is not as interesting as the man who lived it.  I think that the most common comment on this work will be, \\"He's really not the person, I thought he was,\\" which only points out the honesty of the author as regards to his subject.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is incredible.  Chock-full of quotes and insights about human nature.  It's only a shame that the cover of this book makes it appear so typical, because it is ANYTHING but typical.  I can't wait for Rothfuss to come out with the next installment.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Got this as a gift for Christmas, awesome series. I just ordered the second season, can't wait!<br /><br />Think I need to get HBO again!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|6 months and still going strong. Ample processing power for gaming, video editing/conversion and 3d rendering. Couldn't be happier paired with 16gb 1333mhz RAM and a 120gb SSD for blazing fast performance. A very nice upgrade from an Opteron 1218he 2.6ghz chip.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Fun movie to watch with the grandkids now and long ago with our kids when they were young!<br />I purchased this copy for a daughter who lost her's in the divorce!  It was on the top of her list and she's 34.
B009YQJ322|4.0|I did not know what to expect of this movie.  At first it was so graphically violent that I almost quit watching.  As the movie went along it wasn't so graphic and ended up being entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this really fun. Has lots to do but it's addicting.  I wish you could get money in more wAys though
B000641D2Y|5.0|This is a movie all family members will enjoy.  It is refreshing not to have humor based on swearing and inappropriate humor.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|It's very annoying when in the middle of the game it stops working and the only way to go back is logging out and in again, otherwise it's ok.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very well written and is very elaborate.I love how E L James took the thoughts and other forms of Anastasia into perspective.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game because it is like the real card game but you don't have to play with family
0525953728|5.0|Great book about several Seal missions not just the one that got OBL. Well written book, I would recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|once you get a hang of this game you will really enjoy it! treat your horse the best you can and buy her treats she will love you! remember to keep her energy up! have fun!
0316067598|5.0|I am reading a lot of military history books right now and this one was a great read. Highly recommended.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great story of love, friendship and family. Makes you think about the flowers you love and why you love them.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I've seen much better written and produced sci fi; for example Aliens/ Aliens 2/ and Aliens Resurrection.<br />The story needed a lot of improving as did the writing<br />Special effects were over the top trying to hide a B movie
B005WUHAX8|1.0|If I could rate this product with negative stars, I would. I wanted a life proof case because they are smaller than otter boxes and I heard positive things from several friends about them. When I got mine in the mail, here are a few things I noticed wrong with it: 1. the protective piece over the camera lens had popped out. I got it back in an the case still passed the water test so I didn't worry about that at first. Now, it keeps falling out and will not stay in. 2. The screen covering has such bad bubbles that I struggle to hit certain keys. 3. There are grid dots over the bride screen. 4. It is very cheap and plastic feeling. 5. i have to take my phone completely out of the case to turn the volume on and off. 6. the yellow plastic ring on the inside that is for waterproofing falls out everytine i tKe my phone out of fhe case. I could go on and on.... With all of this being said, I heard that there were some fake Lifeproof cases being sold. Mine did not come with instructions, only a slip of paper that advised me to go to the Lifeproof website to watch a video to check for waterproofing. This along with the other negative things I am experiencing are apparently signs of a fake case. I compared mine to a friend's case and his felt much better, it was softer and more rubbery on the edges whereas mine is hard plastic. I dropped it out of my hands onto my desk at work (maybe two feet) and it split down the entire side.<br /><br />I contacted Lifeproof through their website and never hear back from them. I have heard great things about the cases and am disappointed that I didn't have success with mine. It was $50+ wasted for me!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is paranormal, with a hint of romance and myth! I absolutely recommend it to any young, myth and fantasy compelled, wolf-loving people like myself!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book is very suspensful and dark. I loved it!!  I recommend this series and can't wait to finish the series.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I can't get enough of Dexter. Yupp... I'm addicted. And I didn't watch the previews because so many people had complained about it. So I was shocked the whole season through.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Love The Killers and yet another great album. The lyrics and music are exactly what you would expect from this band. Perfection. A must have if you are a fan.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is a great album from 1975! This CD came with an insert containing a brief summary of the band's history until the release<br />of Sabotage.  Quite succinct & comprehensive, it sets the mind toward viewing the entire musical offering as a sort of concept album.  That said, my favorites:  Symptom of the Universe, Thrill of It All, & The Writ.  It's a must - have for the hardcore Sabbath fan.  A great gift for those who appreciate the first few Alice Cooper albums!
B001JIFYSA|3.0|There were endearing moments, but the lack of storyline made it hard to stick with it. We spent most of the movie trying to figure out where the story was going before we finally realized that it wasn't going anywhere.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Listen to the samples. I always say this, but it makes a huge difference. I think this group has some great versatility and vocals. The catchy beats and good lyrics definitely keep me hooked and listening. I feel like from the other albums out there, if they are catching your ear, I would definitely consider buying their album because I have not found anyone that sounds quite like them!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG!!! This book was just as good as the first! You learn just how broken they really are. Broken and immature when it comes to knowing what to do with a relationship. Neither of them had ever had one because of their pasts.<br /><br />You finally find out what happened to Gideon, well the beginning of his torture. They struggle to keep things together and stay strong for the other.<br /><br />I am counting down the days until Entwined in You is released. I am dying to know where things go from the stunning revelation at the end of the book. I honestly hadn't seen it coming at first, but eventually things were clicking for me.<br /><br />Very good book and will be recommending it to anyone who asks! Way to go, Sylvia Day!!!!
B005AERS74|3.0|Like any album, you will always have some songs you like more than others. I am a Maroon 5 fan and chose to buy this album over their latest simply because I enjoyed the variety of music and versatility in this one compared to the last. I felt like their latest album sounds the same throughout most of it. Otherwise, the album is not bad, but I bought it when it was on sale for less than $5. I don't think it is worth your buy if you are going to be paying full price. There are more misses than hits in my opinion, but overall, good, not amazing though!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic and fun<br />Taught my kids alot about the responsibility involved with keeping horse. Only wish you could see the horses at work.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I was surprised by this book. It wasn't what I expected at all. I kept thinking \\"did JK Rowling really write this\\". There is no disputing that this is a well written book with well defined characters, however, {I don't mean to sound prudish) I thought there was too much swearing and graphic detail. Out of such a mundane topic (Council Elections) comes all this ugly bleakness and grittiness. In trying to show us that she can write books for adults I think JK Rowling has gone way over the top.
B005LBJ2GQ|5.0|Focus was a band out of the late 60s.  great stuff.  they did 'Hocus Pocus'... ring a bell??? anyway, This opeth album is styled like those bands did it back then.  i personally love it!  but it's not typical opeth haha!
B0058YPL66|3.0|Grimm is just so much better. The Rumplestilskin character is good on here. and everybody is very well-acted. the evil queen is geat, Ginnifer Goodwin is gret, her daughter is great. the costumes and acting and quality are all great. It is just kind of boring. It makes me fall asleep and I really dont care about the plot and the characters, though i want to.  I love Grimm, this show is very so so, and I put the dvd in when I have no other dvds, because I dont have cable or satellite, so I have no tv reception.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can absolutely rage it up on while getting into your daily workout!  i listen to metallica, opeth, meshuggah, maiden, alice in chains, led zep, everything ozzy, & everything in between & this album is a favorite!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I loved all of the proceeding books, but this one was long and drawn out.  Nothing really seems to happen, just a lot of set up for book 6.
B005HSL626|4.0|It was ok but then when i finished everything i got bored with it and got it off and you know what some friend got the one where you get the stars and i got pissed off
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down! I really hope there will be a continuation and possibly even a movie! Great read for all ages.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was a good game but my sister got a kindle fire just like me and a couple of weeks later she got a NEW one! So i got pissed off and your lucky if you get the new one .
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The first season of this series is only seven episodes long. Each episode is about an hour in length. There are a few extras of short interviews with the cast and crew.<br /><br />Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a middle aged man living in a suburb outside of Albuquerque New Mexico. He has a pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), due in a couple of months, and a teenage son with cerebral palsy, Walt Jr. (R. J. Mitte). He has a very obnoxious brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris) who is a very big goofball and D.E.A. standout. Hank's wife, Marie (Betsy Brandt) is just as annoying and likes to butt into her sister and husband's life. Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, something that he has lost his flare for over the years. All in all, a pretty mundane world for Walt and his family.<br /><br />Walt is informed he has lung cancer.<br /><br />Quite a lousy turn of events for Walt. In order to spare his family he hides the information and takes his brother-in-law's advice of coming along with him on a drug bust. It will help \\"man him up\\", is Hank's advice. While the D.E.A. agents are busy raiding a normal suburban house, Walt notices a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) slipping away. Walt withholds this information and is stunned by the reveal of how much money is in the business of selling methamphetamine: crystal meth. Walt feels that he will not live long and instead of leaving his family with bills and burden, he will secretly make meth and sell it with the help of Jesse.<br /><br />This show is nothing short of amazing. The story. The performances. Incredible. These seven episodes give a great look at a specific drug problem going on in the midwest to pacific time zones of the United States with a grounding with a middle class family struggling to get by. The show does not judge it's characters for their situations of their actions. It simply lets their circumstances and decisions unfold in as objective a way as possible. The show is a hard hitting drama but does have some good comedic moments, especially playing up Walt's fish out of water scenario.<br /><br />This show is in a current line of cable and premium channel viewing that follows a character/characters that have flaws that violates our societies taboos. Other that I have tried but have lost interest in are: \\"Dexter\\", \\"Boardwalk\\", \\"Justified\\", and \\"Homeland\\". It is an interesting pattern that has been developing over the past several years. It goes against the simplified \\"good guy\\" versus \\"bad guy(s)\\" pattern. Usually, someone on the side of the law taking on an \\"evil\\" person to a misunderstood person breaking the law.  It instead takes the basic of creating fictional drama in having a protagonist versus an antagonist. The issue here is the protagonist may be working against the law and doing morally questionable things. Dexter is the most extreme in that he is a serial killer and enjoys his ritualistic style of killing. Now, the antagonist(s) are almost the same as the protagonist to being on the side of the law. A very unique era for television.<br /><br />Walt is a very sympathetic character. He is doing a bad thing but for a good reason. Or so the viewer may feel, until thinking upon it more and analyzing the world we are presented and the characters a little more. One could be left to think is this also part of his condition? A last attempt to do something with his scientific mind? A chance to be more of the macho man society has  not typed cast him as? These are all present but as to how much of each is up to the viewer. Thankfully, the underrated Bryan Cranston was given this role to play this complicated man.<br /><br />These seven episodes can be watched in one sitting this show is that addictive. Episode five has to be the highlight for me. The beginning shows a beat up bad neighborhood with smoke filling the air. Sounds of panic and vehicles can heard taking off to avoid what seems to be the coming of the apocalypse. Big bad biker dudes stare in amazement at the figure the camera follows with such intensity. We cut to this larger than life figure and it turns out to be none other than Walt himself! Now with a shaved head, hard sneer, everyday man clothes, while clutching a duffel bag, daring anyone to come and get it. He gets in the car and slams the door. He looks up as if thanking God to still be alive. This is the roller coaster ride this show provides. And if that beginning to episode five does not cemment you in, this show is not for you. I am already through season three and cannot wait to view on.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This was a good game and all but when i go to level 37 it was relly hard to get coins and stars
B000O8OTNC|2.0|The diamond rod wears off extremely quick, leaving you with just a bare metal rod. The two edge sharpeners are also low quality, Carbide does not set a new edge, and seems to only be two pieces of shaped iron. The ceramic gives the knife a very slight edge which will allow your knife to rip paper with the blade (not cut paper).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a good game if you want to have an experience of having your own own horse to love and take care of.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It is addicting. My horse is the greatest game besides dragonvale. It is so fun and I just love it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was amazing. I really enjoyed reading it. It really was a page turner, keeping me in suspense the entire time.

B009U9S6FI|4.0|A man is for the good of others if he has dignity.<br />The stars were chosen for there  purpose to dream, hope, and see beyond our own eyes.  To show others that together we can reach our goals.<br />Here was a man that could see far beyond his years.  He taught those who would listen that the world is full of pain and discouragement.  But if one was willing to climb to a higher rung in the ladder we too can see father than on the ground.  It sometimes takes more than our own courage.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful.  I could not stop reading it.  I live near Philly so the eagles references really hit home as well
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a page burner from the first page.  Most of the stuff the lone astronaught did was very plausable.  The ending was not what I thought would happen.  I was faked out....Good read.  Need more like this that is believeable.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|A very solid album of pop craftsmanship.  Per Gessle continues to amaze with his prolific songwriting talents for writing catchy pop songs that sound fresh and improve with repeated listenings.  Marie and Per both sing just as well on these as they did over 20 years ago and they still can rock or perform a soft ballad better than practically anybody out there today.  All tracks are very worthwhile though favorites include Touched By The Hand Of God, Excuse Me Sir . . , and Lover Lover Lover.  Great CD.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Oh to be able to watch the series at leisure and replay whatever I want.....a wonderful recording for the serious Downton fan...well worth it and top quality.

B002ZG98J6|1.0|I really like the movie, itself and this review is NOT about the movie.  (I do hope they'll release movies for the remaining books.)  This review is about the physical product, specially the digital copy.<br /><br />When I got the product I copied to my workstation (PC) a copy of the movie using the Digital Copy disc.  I was successful and able to watch the movie without any problem.  Today, I'm trying to watch it a second time (ONLY THE SECOND TIME) and after entering the serial number, I'm told \\"Allowed license acquisitions exceeded.\\"  Again it is my understanding I should be able to watching the movie an unlimited period of time and for an unlimited number of times.  Certainly twice is NOT acceptable!<br /><br />I contacted Fox Digital Copy and have yet to hear back from them.  I don't know how long it takes to hear back or if they even provide any support after getting their money.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray and DVD copies are working fine, but the price / product also includes the digital copy.  If it isn't going to work, well, they should price the product for only the Blu-Ray and DVD copies, right?!
B00683JK9K|1.0|I think I would really like this app if it would work properly.  On my Kindle Fire I was unable to turn the pieces.  Therefore, I couldn't work any of the puzzles that required turning of pieces.  I wish that the developer would fix this problem.  I read other reviews that also complained about this.  If fixed, I am sure I would like it as I like to work jigsaw puzzles.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is awesome. I also love the graphics and the new update. It really spiced up the game a lot!!!! Love the game and I bet every other person that got the game loves it to!!! Also what I absolutely love about the game is FFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|As a longtime fan I was very apprehensive getting this record after I wasn't initially impressed with the pre-release video for \\"Closer\\", but I got it because I have loved everything else these ladies have done. Tegan's collaboration with Against Me! cemented my love for these two. So I buy the record and I couldn't be happier. I played it through and didn't find a single missed step in my super judgmental brain. My ears are very happy today. This record has played through three times in a row and I still have no desire to change it out. The new direction was foreshadowed years ago, it's called growth. I'm glad I didn't let my first impression hinder my choice to get the record, because it has caught me completely off-guard with it's incredible likability and my continual enthusiasm. Longtime fans will buy it and \\"get it\\" and \\"Heartthrob\\" will surely win the ladies a whole new fan base as every track really could be a single.
B004XN3FHA|4.0|This is a very good, very bright flashlight.  But it's expensive.  If you are looking for a bright flashlight but don't need anything fancy, you might want to get another less expensive flashlight from Fenix.  If you need something durable that throws a lot of tong of light, then this is the one.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This is one of those cartoons that was made for the entire family to enjoy.  It had jokes for kids, teens, and adults.
B007RKPO84|5.0|This album marks my first taste ever of Kreator.  I love thrash, and have most of the old standbys in Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, Exodus, etc...but had never heard Kreator before.  I'm always looking for a new group, and have found that I generally like the old school bands the best (see above).  I was a little leery about getting Kreator because, well....I didn't really associate \\"German\\" and \\"thrash\\" as going together.  Sounds terrible, I know, and no offense to anyone, but maybe it's because the other German rock bands I've heard, although decent, are a bit cheesy (Helloween, Scorpions).  I can even take cheesiness to some degree, but not in my thrash.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings, I've read great reviews of Kreator so I decided to give this disc a spin and, to my pleasant surprise, it's THRASH!  With no cheese!  In fact, its everything I like in thrash:  It's brutal, fast, heavy, and even melodic.  Again, with no cheese! I know it's good stuff when my wife asks me to turn it down...or off!  I've got to listen to more of their discs to see where I'd rate them overall as a band, but this disc ranks right up there with any of the bands I mentioned above.  I've already put some of their other discs on my wish list, because if they are all as good as this one, I'm a definite fan.  I recommend this album to all fans of thrash and/or metal.<br /><br />BTW...I've heard that their 90's output is kind of weak.  Any input from fans out there on that???
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've watched theater productions of Les Mis, watched screen adaptations, and read the book several times over, and this cinematic adaptation ranks highly on my list of adaptations. As a musical film, it is well put-together, utilizing a stellar cast who delivers compelling performances in both acting and singing, excellent set-up of scenes, credible costumes and sets making the period and setting of 19th century France come alive, and spectacular effects.<br /><br />I read some critical reviews which found the singing of the cast members to be less than impressive. I agree only with regards to three characters - Russell Crowe's Inspector Javert, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Crowe's emoting as Javert was well done with his facial expressions credibly portraying his resolute nature and steadfast obsession in hunting Jean Valjean, but his singing just wasn't up to par although to be fair some of his songs were incredibly difficult. I felt an actor who had more of an established singing<br />background would have fared much better in this role. The Thenardiers' portrayal did not sit well with me either - Cohen's and Helena Bonham Carter's singing performances were just plain awful.<br /><br />Now that I've got the criticisms out of the way, let me comment on the positives. Hugh Jackman blew me away with his performance - I avoided comparing his performance to the Broadway productions because they are two entirely different mediums. These actors had to sing live on set and Jackman's background in singing with his strong, commanding voice as well as his experience as an actor really served him well in the challenging role of lead character Jean Valjean. There were scenes where Valjean displays his inner conflict - the beginning when he is railing against the injustice of his imprisonment, the scene where he is praying and reflecting on the priest's kindness to him and how he experiences this epiphany of how to transform his life, later still when he has embraced a new identity and is prospering as the Mayor of a city and his turmoil when he finds Javert has been dispatched to work in his city, so much more, and all done with impeccable finesse. Even when his voice at times breaks during a performance, I found it compelling because this is how one would expect it to be in real life - emotions impacting one's voice (not that people go through life singing their emotions out all the time). It was heartbreaking, 'real', and did not feel put on at all. Jackman delivers an Oscar worthy performance and I hope he gets it.<br /><br />Fantine as portrayed by the beautiful and talented Anne Hathaway (I grew from a non-fan to a fan - starting from The Devil Wears Prada to the latest Batman and this) just broke my heart. That one song, \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" was so achingly poignant and full of despair - this is a woman brought so low by life's circumstances and filled with despair - as I watched Fantine sing, I could only think, \\"God, this is how I imagined Fantine when I read the book,\\" so really, what more could be said. Hathaway embodies Fantine - her hopes, dashed dreams, and her despair with heartbreaking clarity.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried as Cossette was lovely but I would not go so far as to say it was a spectacular performance but my, what a revelation Eddie Redmayne was as Marius. I've been a bit of a fan after watching him in My Week With Marilyn, and he is amazing here as the young revolutionary who is besotted with Cossette. His voice is compelling and his yearning and aching love for Cossette is credibly conveyed by his voice in song.<br /><br />Eponine as played by Samantha Barks was another favorite character who also broke my heart. Her songs, delivered with such sadness and yearning, and those haunting eyes just tugged at the heartstrings. The young actor who plays Gavroche, Daniel Huttlestone, the street urchin and young revolutionary in the making delivered a performance that is memorable for its sincerity and spiritedness.<br /><br />Though the movie is rather long in length at slightly over two and a half hours, I did not feel like the movie dragged at all. Each scene was carefully set up and orchestrated and the songs and dialogue all came together beautifully. When I heard that famous line, \\"To love someone is to see the face of God\\", I wept because that scene to me at least embodied what Hugo's work was all about. This is a beautiful cinematic masterpiece and I feel richer for having watched it.or its sincerity and spiritedness.<br /><br />Though the movie is rather long in length at slightly over two and a half hours, I did not feel like the movie dragged at all.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|This little gadget was great for about 6-7 months. It stopped working for no apparent reason. This was the only adapter I found that I could use with my iPhone while on its lifeproof case. So sad that it lasted for less than a year. Company did not respond to my emails nor they offer any warranty.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted CableJive and got a brand new device right away. Great customer service has earned another star in my review.

[The words in this book, his] last ones, free as they are of sentiment or self-pity, are among his...best.\\"<br /><br />The above comes from the foreword of this book published posthumously by Christopher Hitchens (born 1949).  Hitchens was a contributing editor to the popular magazines \\"Vanity Fair,\\" \\"Slate,\\" and the \\"Atlantic,\\" among other publications.  He was also the author of many books such as the international bestseller \\"God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything.\\"<br /><br />This book is composed of seven essays by Hitchens which first appeared in the popular magazine \\"Vanity Fair.\\"  They concern his struggle with esophageal cancer in which he was diagnosed during his 2010 book tour.  (The actual diagnosis occurred in June, 2010 and he succumbed to his illness on Dec. 15, 2011.  \\"The end was unexpected.\\")<br /><br />Also included is an eighth chapter of unfinished \\"fragmentary jottings\\" and an After Word by Hitchens' second wife and widow.<br /><br />The essays consider such things as:<br /><br />(1) his fear of losing his ability to write<br />(2) the torture of chemotherapy<br />(3) an analysis of the well-known statement \\"whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\"<br />(4) the joy of conversation<br />(5) the very meaning of life itself<br /><br />What I particularly enjoyed was his dissection of a posting by a religious zealot concerning Hitchens' esophageal cancer.  Hitchens tells us that,<br /><br />\\"You haven't lived...until you have read contributions...on the websites of the faithful.\\"<br /><br />One of many things this zealot gets wrong was calling Hitchens an atheist.  He was not an atheist.<br /><br />Yes, there is even humour in this book!<br /><br />I was going to give this book a lower rating than I did but then I considered that the eloquent words in this book were written by a dying intellect who preferred \\"to confront death with both eyes open\\" and refused \\"to cower in the face of the unknown.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I feel it's fitting to mention some of the names of the people who paid tribute to Hitchens after his death:<br /><br />(1) former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (2) British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins (3) American writer and neuroscientist Sam Harris (4) Director of the National Institutes of Health and former head of the Human Gnome Project Francis Collins (5) philosopher Daniel Dennett (6) physicist Lawrence Krauss (7) actor Sean Penn<br /><br />In Oct. 2012, Hitchens was posthumously awarded the John Lennon Prize.<br /><br />In summary, this is a unique book of which I learned quite a bit.

140123769X|4.0|There are a few series that have continued to be excellent throughout their entire run and I expect to be excellent well into the future.<br /><br />Fables is always interesting, full of twists and turns and excitement. Though the great Fables war was easily the best, this focuses on the children of Snow White and Bigby, the wolf. This is the kind of thing that Disney could never do. They would never be so brutal with their characters. They want happy endings, but the original fables, handed down through history, do not always have happy endings. Fables understands that. There are times when I get to the end of a plot and realize that it feels like an old story. Fables can be sweet and painful all in one moment, and this latest volume does both.

I found myself not rooting for the prosecution or defense necessarily, but for the truth - a slippery entity in a case like Jacob's. What a riveting ride! Landay is a master storyteller and the court room drama is more intense than that of any TV show or movie. I read the entire book in two sittings - it's addicting.

It really sticks to the book and has so many wonderful details.

B007F7QG0Y|2.0|Life<br />  by<br />  Keith Richards & James Fox<br />  A REVIEW OF THE AUDIO EDITION<br />  by<br />  Colin J. Edwards<br /><br />I have always thought I might be out-of-step, but I never realized how far until I considered reading, and writing a review of 'Life', the autobiography of  the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Underwritten by a $7 million advance, it was released to extravagant acclaim in October 2010. Since then, sales have exceeded 1 million copies.<br /><br />I am not a musician, but that shouldn't preclude me from reading books about musicians. I'm not a bomber pilot either, but that didn't stop me writing about the 8th Air Force in WWII. I don't know much about taking drugs either: at least I didn't until I read this book. This work could have been entitled 'Addiction, and How To Achieve It\\".<br /><br />Most autobiographies are descriptions of how the author sees him/herself, or how they would like to be seen. As such, they are essentially fiction. James Fox's work is no exception - I don't think anyone would believe for a second that Keith Richards could have written this book himself.<br />I suspect that Fox, complete with notebook and recorder,  sat and listened to Richards ramble, and then; at his leisure, attempted to knock it into readable prose. That is what it sounds like anyway.<br /><br />The book is phony. From the start  where Richards slurs his way through the introduction in a funny fabricated accent; sometime posh, sometime cockney  sometime mid-Atlantic, but most mostly Kentish swede, to his self gratification at the end. He pretends to be a Londoner, and tries to sound like one. \\"The Dartford Rolling Stones\\" doesn't quite have the right ring to it, albeit accurate. He parasited on the work and talent of others, and claimed them as his own. His total lack of self-respect, caused him to succeed where a normal person's natural reticence would have inhibited them.  He is coarse, crude and offensive. Had he not achieved celebrity by fluke of birth and timing, he would almost certainly be in jail.<br /><br />Anyone expecting some juicy revelations will be sadly disappointed. There is nothing in this book that we haven't heard about before, ad nauseam. Richards doesn't describe himself as always in a drug induced stupor, some of the time he is just drunk. But, by his own admission, he is always irresponsible.<br /><br />Keith Richards comes out of this book as a sad deficient man, deficient of everything but money. It is apparent that he cannot come to terms with the fact that when the Rolling Stones is mentioned, the next words will be Mick Jagger, not Keith Richards.<br /><br />If you have been drawing your State Pension for the last ten years and hanker after the 'good old days', this book is not going to help you. But if you enjoy the ramblings of an old geezer who was once part of a popular bad, then this is the book for you.<br />The work encourages and glorifies drug abuse, lawbreaking, and physical violence, and is offensive on every page.  I just hope that the millions of people who have bought it, keep it out of the hands of their children.<br />February 9, 2013y by fluke of birth and timing, he would almost certainly be in jail.<br /><br />Anyone expecting some juicy revelations will be sadly disappointed.

B005LAIIKI|4.0|NOTE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STRICT REVIEW OF \\"DJANGO,\\" LOOK ELSEWHERE.<br /><br />All on board to see a Quentin Tarantino movie?  Let's check the list:<br /><br />Hollywood star power?  Check.  Masterful characterizations?  Check.  Clever plot twists? Check.  Lots of wordplay?  Check.<br /><br />Good...sounds like a nice night.  Oh, but don't forget...<br /><br />Rampant brutality?  Check.  Murder and mayhem?  Check.  Buckets of blood?  Check.  Strings of nasty racial epithets?  Check.<br /><br />Yes, like it or not, they're both Tarantino.  I like him; in fact, ever since I first saw RESERVOIR DOGS--when I had realized this was a real Hollywood star in the making--I have caught every movie he's directed or written.  It's just that I'm beginning to see the pattern, and I'm wondering if he's gotten caught up in himself.<br /><br />And so, what about \\"Django\\"?  Well, I particularly enjoyed the first half, where the pacing and plot really sizzled.  But it was during the second half when I began wondering if he isn't getting a bit predictable, substituting blood and offal for substance.  Of late, in fact, it's been one of the main concerns I have with Tarantino's \\"direction\\"--and I mean that in both senses.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"predictable,\\" alone, is the wrong word, but...to invent an oxymoron for this director...I think Tarantino's becoming guilty of \\"predictable shock.\\"<br /><br />As an example I bring up the \\"n-word,\\" which is a word I can't even spell out in this review, but it is used as freely in this movie as oxygen.  And yes, I know the whole notion of slavery is repulsive and the director wants to shock us, but one begins to wonder why Tarantino revels in this aspect SO much.  It's OVERDONE...much like the use of swear words by a precocious teenager when out of sight of the parents.<br /><br />And it's not just racial epithets...it's anything he can do to stun the audience.<br /><br />It's EVERYWHERE for him: in [[ASIN:B002YCVX5S Inglourious Basterds]] the shock tactic is applied to a farcical imagining of a platoon of vengeful G.I. Jews (how could the director not have utilized that pun?), and in [[ASIN:B003VMFWYI Grindhouse (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] it's the ludicrous inanity of steroidal zombies run amuck, and characters have names like \\"The Rapist\\"; in [[ASIN:B006RXQ8RI Kill Bill: Volume 1]] it's all about chopsocky violence so plentiful that in one incredibly l-o-n-g sequence the walls and floor drip crimson; in [[ASIN:B006SAR6P8 Kill Bill: Volume 2]]  our protagonist lies in a coma for four years while an orderly charges \\"customers\\" money to repeatedly rape her...<br /><br />Do I have to go on?  [[ASIN:B005T3AYAE Pulp Fiction]], [[ASIN:B001DM1V52 Reservoir Dogs]], and even films in which he does piecework--like \\"From Dusk 'Til Dawn,\\" [[ASIN:B0065AVS0K Sin City]], [[ASIN:B000HL093A Natural Born Killers]]--it seems he is a giggly boy out to paint on a canvas that with only the red portion of the spectrum.<br /><br />I don't want to come off as a grumpy old man, but I'm wondering what Tarantino is wasting his considerable talent this way.  There are so many great scenes that he creates when he tries.<br /><br />In \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" Christoph Weitz's interrogation of the Frenchman in his house absolutely terrifies the viewer though its subtle undertone of menace; in \\"Kill Bill II\\" David Carradine's monologue about Superman's lack of a mask is wonderful not only because of its intelligence, but also in how it allows him to parade his superior position over the protagonist.<br /><br />And who can forget Samuel Jackson's and John Travolta's offbeat conversation about French Burger Kings--as well as the grand history of the Bruce Willis' wristwatch--in \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and the magnificent opening scene in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" between mobsters arguing with each other about what Madonna meant by her expression \\"Like a Virgin\\"?<br /><br />And all of these great scenes--and others--are done without violence.<br /><br />Tarantino can MAKE stars as well as re-awaken fading actors careers.  He has developed a genre of playful innovation, like the use of anime in \\"Kill Bill\\" to tell the horrible story of one assassin's upbringing;  the use of editing to skip the ENTIRE robbery that is at the very HEART of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\"; the anachronistic style of telling stories that skip here and there in time (used so well in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and the two \\"Kill Bills,\\" particularly).<br /><br />The thing that bothers me about \\"Django\\" is the joy in the vile, especially in a time where guns are such a prevalent force in America.  It's constant: it's in the use of language, it's in the hateful killing.  And, more than ever now, he's reveling in the ecstasy of violence, gouts of blood, and wholesale slaughter.<br /><br />As Tarantino is rumored to be directing \\"Kill Bill 3,\\" not much is going to change---not very soon, at least.  I do love this man's talent, but I feel has not yet displayed the maturity that defines a great director; an ability to do more than just continue one particular kind of film.<br /><br />I look forward to the day he is more than this generation's Sam Peckinpah.  I hope I get to see what he is capable of BEYOND the merely titillating, and defines himself not as a giggly boy, but as a man..<br /><br />Tarantino can MAKE stars as well as re-awaken fading actors careers.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Got the seasons version of this game the other day, and liked it very much. Downloaded this version so that I would would have more puzzles available. Glad that I got this.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie is really great!! Starting with the story, then the characters and really good animation, my whole family was engaged throughout the duration.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|2/9/2013 This book has been carefully crafted for people like me who need to be taken by the hand and shown where to click to make an eBook.<br /><br />However, it doesn't take into account that after your hard drive has been fried and the new replacement computer has MS Word 2010 Starter installed, you may not have access to the easy-peasy MS Word \\"Insert Table of Contents\\" function. And if you want to create an eBook for Kindle, you must have a clickable Table of Contents (TOC). NB: Do NOT try to use Insert Table to create your Table of Contents. Kindle cannot handle this idea, ingenious though it may seem to you.<br /><br />Since it is not made clear in this guide whether a faked but clickable list of Table of Content entries is acceptable (we shan't even discuss the HTML Table of Contents or the NCX logical Table of Contents at this point), you are left hanging.<br /><br />You can upload a short eBook at Amazon Kindle without it having the most strongly recommended type of TOC. As MS Word 2010 Starter is so widespread, a short section describing how to create a TOC with it would be a great improvement to \\"Building Your Book for Kindle.\\" I stumbled upon the following method, as the Starter menu icons are not fully self-explanatory.<br /><br />Quick Instructions for How to Create a Table of Contents with Microsoft Word 2010 Starter:<br /><br />1. Type your book in an MS Word 2010 Starter document. Begin with centered Title Page (page break here), centered copyright page (another page break), and dedication phrase if desired (another page break). Complete the text, typing a heading for each chapter or item (\\"Chapter 1,\\" etc.).<br />2. Type a basic (straight text only) Table of Contents (TOC) after the dedication page which lists all the chapter or item headings you want included there.<br />3. Highlight each of the chapter or item titles both in the TOC and in the body of the document and choose at the top of the screen Home > Style and click \\"Heading 1\\" (to keep the font and text size you want, right-click instead on \\"Heading 1\\" and choose \\"Update Heading 1 to Match Selection\\"). This automatically inserts the selected text into a \\"Bookmark\\" location that is invisible for the moment.<br />4. Now highlight the first item in the TOC, then on the Insert tab at the top of the screen, click the Hyperlinks/Links globe icon. On the left sidebar of the window that opens up, choose \\"Place in this document,\\" and you'll see in the main window pane a list of the text you marked as Heading 1.<br />5. Find the corresponding title for the body of the document and click on it to select it, then click OK.<br />6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each TOC entry.<br />7. Then go backwards: highlight the first title in the body of the document, then on the Insert tab, click the Hyperlinks/Links globe icon. On the left sidebar of the window that opens up, choose \\"Place in this document,\\" and you'll see in the main window pane that same list of the text you marked as Heading 1.<br />8. Find the corresponding title for the Table of Contents and click on it to select it, then click OK.<br />9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 for each title in the body of the document.<br /><br />Now the TOC entries go to the chapter or item titles as required, and the chapter or item titles return to the Table of Contents. (Note: You may link many different titles or phrases inward to the same bookmarked text, but any one title or phrase can only be linked outward to one other place.)<br /><br />You can use the same procedure to add \\"To Top\\" (which should go to the first word of the eBook title on the Title Page) and \\"To Table of Contents\\" after each chapter/item, and to create an Index if you wish.<br /><br />Now that you know the easy idiot's solution for a simple clickable Table of Contents, here's the HTML info from Microsoft:<br /><br />How to Create a Dynamic Table of Contents<br />[...]%28v=vs.85%29.aspx<br /><br />(Don't let it scare you!)you!)
B007C3TVNA|1.0|I finally watched this movie because I think that Tilda is an amazing actress.  However, this movie doesn't do her justice.  She is the only thing good about the movie, but it's too painful too watch.  In the movie, her son is a true psychopath who seems to have been born with the intent to destroy his mother; he does that and so much more. It raises a question that I often ponder: can one be born EVIL??? Is there a chemical or neurological explanation for the monster that he becomes?
B0026SCMNM|3.0|IT JUST WASNT MY THING --MY TYPE OF BOOK  MAYBE NOT EXCITING ENOUGH1<br /><br />OTHERS I REFERRED IT LIKED VERY MUCH
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Serves as an alarm and noise-pacifier.There is bound to be a sound that you will enjoy. Try it with your baby,meditation, home yoga,or just for some simple background noise while reading. You can even add your own to the list too. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this. game is the best game in. the world I love it I play it every. day.  I love. this. app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne rights with such detail that you quickly become immersed. Easy to read; I finished impatiently awaiting the next installment.
B000683VI4|5.0|it is a well written story set on the cost of nc by a writer who has won numerous awards.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 has bright graphics and the games moves along really quickly and is very addictive. Although I find it quite difficult to move to different levels.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|one of our favorite movies which has a very unique plot so it is very intresting to watch what is not so familiar
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Toca Hair Salon is such a fun Ap for the kids to play and even for adults. No violence just fun.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|very classic western movie and a lot of good actors though not the best movie far from the worst one.
0399226907|5.0|Grew up with this book... It is a must have for every youngsters book collection, starting out my grandson with it.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|It streamed very well on our flat panel. Plus it had great actors with a good but different story line which was not a traditional or normal type script or story. Very enjoyable.
0920668364|5.0|Read this to my children as they were growning up, as a mom I loved it, as a Gramma I want to pass on that tradition.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|tre love in every sense our favorite movie of all time and all the spin offs from it are very good
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Soft, black and classy, this cover is easy to keep clean without having that cheap, plastic look many others have. The inside is soft and velvety and caresses your Kindle softly inside, like the perfect little black dress would. Looks sleek and sexy, holds everything in place, and easy to keep clean. What more could one want? Highly recommended!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|we adore this movie because the details as well as the actors and it has several twists and turns to keep it intersting
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Loved this one. Great sound track and engaging story. Would recomend this to anyone. The streaming is perfect on amazon prime.
B003DGZCLK|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie in many years.  It streamed flawlessly. It is set in the post-apocolyptic future with Mad Max wandering the countryside trying to survive. Plenty of action.
B0019GO58C|5.0|i have this Dvd of it  & its My christmas time  movie !!  LOL<br />i watch this twice every year !!<br />  You can't help who & how you fall in love & i tell ya. meryl streep  is the best !!!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|Great horror movie...not many of those out there but this is definitely one of the better ones.  I was not expecting much, especially with the beginning which was a bit cheesy--but it is supposed to be.<br /><br />It is similar to the Blair Witch Project but stuff actually happens.  The actors are great and so are the effects.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|This is wonderful disc and I am very happy with all aspects of this disc. A timeless classic. Well presented.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love the concept of the Wool series. I couldn't put it down. Had to keep finding out what was next. Already bought the prequel series (The Shift), but as always with great books like this, I hope there are more to come.
B0042GNDO8|5.0|These are sublime, he is a master of the violin. A must for any Violin lover. A timeless classic. Sublime.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.So easy to use and it gives me all the information I want at a glance. Again love it!!!!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is wonderful. I watched it on TV last year and wanted to own it. The five disc case isbeautifully presented.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Really like the game.  Nice colors and fast pace game.  I play the free version, but this one is more interesting. Not boring.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|Let me start by saying I have been a huge Yes fan since my father introduced me to them 35 years ago.  I have seen them in concert numerous times and have always had a great experience.  To sum it up - they are my \\"go to band\\".  From the intricacies of \\"Tales\\" to the throaty \\"90125\\", I have always been a fan.<br /><br />With all that being said, somehow I missed the debut of this album.  I literally discovered this album 2 weeks ago... and I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT.  Seriously.  It has literally taken me back 20 years when I used to have to go to sleep listening to my current obsession.  I have this on my phone and am waking up at 3 in the morning with my headphones on with this still playing.<br /><br />These are great musicians... they make great music...  get this and enjoy it!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was very with every detail and the fantasy that just pops. It was way better than the movie.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I bought the hard backs until I got an iPad and started reading on that so I purchased the entire set (6 at that time) and started all over again enjoying the series.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Very cool book. I enjoy reading books with a different way of looking at everyday things. I believe that many people go through life with phobias and difficulties and it is very interesting to read about the way others see things I don't ever consider.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I started with Outlander many years ago when Diana had just finished writing her first novel and I have followed Jmie and Claire for almost 15 years now and always anxiously await the next installment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is perfection. If you don't find yourself mesmerized by the story and on the edge of your seat I don't know if you know what a good book really is. Enough said.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Absolutly loved this book.  It was the kind of book that when you finished the book you sat there just thinking about what had happened.  I read all four of Kate Morton's books, and loved them all.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|This movie made me have every emotion you could experience.  I plan on buying this movie in the near future.  I think this movie portrayed Beatrix Potter very well.  I had no idea she wrote these books.  This movie is now among my favorites.  I love it!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I can't get enough of this CD!  The concert was beautifully done.  This is one of my favorite shows and this concert recording includes everything that happened that night.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Perfect for the job! I do not know how I managed with out this working with 3D design. This is a needed tool.
B000006OS2|2.0|This is a great movie.  Fun to watch.  However, the DVD I received is of the worst quality I have ever seen on a DVD.  It looks as if someone recorded off the TV using a camcorder.  Often out of focus even at its best it is ridiculously horrible to view.  Suggest getting the movie, just not this version!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a good game its like temple run But better baceuse as you go on and on the game it get faster and taste this such a cool game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|keeps you wanting more - purchased one book and had to have the other two - wish there was more
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|good and loud if your going to make your alarm I use it every week because I Aubert to go to school mon - fri it really works
B009S33I68|5.0|Soon to be 50 years ago, not unlike the '90's when we remembered our veterans who fought and died in WWII, it's time to read this exceptional and historical work about one of the great battles of the Vietnam War.  We cannot forget the sacrifices made by the American heroes of the war, no matter how historians opine it's merit or its outcome.  Each page tells us about real soldiers who did Americas's work.  The book also reminds the reader of the horrors or war and the impact of each injury and death upon all of America.
0515149489|2.0|Remember when NR used to write sexy love stories? The male character in this book is just awful. He's mean, stubborn and kind of dumb. And the male/female characters just don't match, no matter how much NR tries to make it work, it doesn't. The wasn't a novel, it was a dog training lecture. Sigh. She used to be so good.
8866130923|5.0|I have been using this style of planner for the past 3 consecutive years. I am picky when it comes to planners. I don't want them to be too big because they need to comfortably fit in my purse, they can't be too heavy because my purse already contains enough junk in it to wear it down, and I needed the writing spaces to be large enough to write enough notes, appointments, and reminders, and this fits this bill. At the beginning of each month you get a page with all 30 days, and is followed with a week a page calender. Each slot is large enough for the above mentioned things, and on the opposite page you have a blank, lined page for any additional writing. I just LOVE the folder in the back. Great for receipts or other small items. If this wasn't a top notch planner, I wouldn't continue to buy it year after year.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Season 4 marks the turning point from Biker Drama to a more in depth study of the corrosive effects of power.  Nobody escapes the vortex of violence.  Having watched this again after the end of season 5 it's even more apparent how season 4 sets up the dramatic shifts of season 5 as characters lose their philophical moorings in family and &#34;goodness&#34; and follow their darker sides.
0765325950|5.0|The epic battle between good and evil comes to a nailbiting climax in A Memory of Light. Brandon Sanderson delivers & lives up to the legacy of Robert Jordan in the final volume of The Wheel of Time series.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I started watching this show because of the Sons of Anarchy connection.  I found the first couple of episodes to be kind of dark, but into the 3d episode the complexity is beginning to emerge.  Characters are not all bad or all good.  Should be an interesting run.<br /><br />I bought the 4th episode and have tried twice now to watch it, but all I get is the \\"connecting\\" symbol.  It's very disappointing to set aside an evening to watch something and then just sit there hoping it will connect.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Its a good game with in-depth detail and lots of control. The combat simulations are not real good. but it is still an interesting game to play.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I have used this product for years and on other platforms. DocumentsToGo has been consistently reliable, so it remains my first choice for document-functions through all of my tech-toy evolutions. The single downside would be to make it easier for users who are not in Canada, the US or the UK to buy it.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|This Super Deluxe Edition in fantastic!  It includes not only the remastered original album and B-sides, but the DVD has &#34;The Making of The Unforgettable Fire&#34; which I remember seeing forever ago and their ground breaking performance from Live Aid which made them bonafide superstars.<br /><br />If you are a fan, you will love this package!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Do this puzzle almost every night.  Can be challenging sometimes but very good for keeping the mind sharp which us elderly need to stay young. It is fun and I love a challenge.
B005N0C0I2|5.0|This is a great album from one of the best songwriters and musicians of our day.  It is solid all the way through, no filler songs.  Don't just take my word for it, buy it and see for yourself.  You will not be disappointed!
B007PKDW44|5.0|Its hard to say what this reminds me of. It brings me back to the hair band metal days on certain songs, and some are heavy metal like Metalica. Still it also has some rockabilly too. Kinda like a cross between Metalica, Dio and The stray cats. Anyway it works wonderfully and i love this cd!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Mortality was the type of book where you didn't know whether to laugh or cry. It is told with Christopher Hitchens' mix of brilliant dispassionate satiric wit with the tragic outcome that all of us know. I only wish that when my time comes that I can approach my death with the same kind of humor, clear thinking and grace as he did. Of course, that will be impossible as there is only one Christopher Hitchens. Truly one of our generations greatest minds.
0446547573|5.0|This book was a great story!  I loved it.  I loved the little twist at the end.<br /><br />He can sure write a great story!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|i wasn't sure what I was getting when I bought it. I did not like the contents and did not finish it and probably will not ever finish it.
B005KELQEU|4.0|Well made and expect it will provide good protection for Kindle while travelling.  A loop for a stylis would be a nice addition.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|i got this book on recommendation from my brother who loves it.  i have seen the movie and it was good.  i am having a hard time getting into reading this one.
1452110581|5.0|Definitely a read-again book for cat lovers.  Liked it well enough to buy two more to give as Christmas presents to like-minded people.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|KIND OF FUN BUT NOT VERY CHALLENGING, I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES THAT HELP ME THINK AHEAD AND WORK MY BRAINS.....CB
1449410243|2.0|Don't care for this comic-book like format.  Now I know enough to try the &#34;look inside&#34; feature before ordering any kind of non-prose book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is one of the best apps ever I got it for my kindle fire and its awesome and addictive
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Quick read mainly because you can't put it down. So well written. Incredible, and sweet, and amazing. Thanks, John Green. Augustus!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game because it's free and its a simple game. This game is also like temple run but is better because  you don't have the risk of dropping it.
1449433251|5.0|After my house fire, I knew these were some of the books I definitely would be replacing.  Thanks for the quick shipment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such a fun game me my sister and my 3 friends are so addicted to this game it is one of the coolest games ever
B0086700CM|5.0|My grandkids talked me into downloading this onto my Kindlefire. I think I might be addicted. Love it, a lot of fun. I also have 2.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The pace is way too slow-too many irrelevant nude scenes. Kind of interesting story but I would not order this movie.  Wait until it comes on FX or USA network.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|My other cable or wiring was sent back with non functioning kindle. Missed my Kindle when it stopped functioning.  what was wrong with it?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I love this series.  All three seasons.  Would recommend this to anyone.  When my wife first mentioned it I didn't think I would like it, I was wrong.
0307730697|5.0|We read this book for my book club and I was unsure if I would like it since I don't usually enjoy books dealing with war. This book is so much more! It tells the story of a young guy who overcomes so many challenges in his life and becomes an inspiration to many. It also shows the unconditional love and support that Adam Brown's wife and family gave him to  help him succeed. I certainly have the utmost respect for the unsung heroes who are fighting for our freedom, after reading this book. I highly recommend it, especially for young people.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this is a fun and good time killer game....some stages are a real hair pulled...only thing from give a 5 star rating is the music....sounds like stuck in an elevator for hours...uggggg!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Oh my gosh this is like the best book ever I finished in a month! I am going to read the other books too! I highly recommend this book, but it would be better teens.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|On my kindle fire the app would open and close after the fifth time opening it but overall its a great game.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was captivated with this book with the first few sentences that I read and that captivation continued through the entire book. Harold's journey is not only a physical feat but a mental and emotional one as well that can teach the reader a thing or two about themselves without even trying. After reading this book I feel as though I made a few new friends and that is how I know I've read an excellent story.
B005DD7MH8|1.0|It appears I accidently order this.  I did not  want it at all!  Before I knew it my account was charged.  I meant to buy the DVD as a gift for someone who does not own a computer.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|its good I like it.  You can't beat the price. good thing to have you won't regret having purchased it.
B008S4YZCO|2.0|I like I said boring and it keeps on freezing and glitching. had to shut down my kindle multiple times because of it. I'm not wasting my time on it.
B00005Y23E|5.0|Reggae music can't get better than this. Bob Marley, with his relaxing rhythms and mind challenging lyrics is the BEST! Very well done, re-recorded music which helps me to calm down after a mental exhausting day at work (I'm in the mental health field) or simply just driving around, getting lost in the music and sometimes pretending being in Negril, at the most beautiful beach ever. Also, it seems to be the only album with &#34;Punky Reggae Party,&#34; one of my most favorite songs ever.
B004J4WLPU|2.0|When ever I read a mystery I like to be able to see the end coming. I like for the author to give us some hints or some logic along the way that gives us a heads up concerning who the killer is. Rosamund Lupton didn't do this in this book. The story went on to long and was a little contrived.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Interesting story line with interesting twist. Clint Eastwood is doing a decent job using skilled artist in appropriate roles; however, big deficit when it comes to the female cast (they are outstanding!) only completely overpowered by the men. As a movie producer, Clint could have used the story line to empower women and at the end unite women and mean in attempts to bring clarity and heal.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen had such a great sense of humor.  This book is so enjoyable on so many different levels.  I am a light to moderate reader and this book had me entertained right away.  I highly recommend it.
0714864803|5.0|Recipes are beautifully presented and easy to follow. The food tastes divine. You'll enjoy new combinations of ingredients. Already a favorite in our home.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It was exactly what I had ordered and my son loves it.  I would recommend purchasing DVDs through you all to anyone.
B004TI5N38|5.0|The main character, CID agent John Puller, finds himself in unimaginable positions as he is dispatched to a small mining town to investigate something so concerning, so secretive, that the government will entrust the investigation only to Puller.  Puller's intuition and investigative skills provide the reader with suspenseful entertainment.<br /><br />I enjoyed &#34;Zero Day&#34; so much that I purchased and just completed &#34;The Forgotten&#34; - another John Puller character book by David Baldacci.  Hopefully, there will soon be another book with CID agent John Puller.
0812550706|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my son.  He already read this but wanted the whole set and reread the book.  He enjoyed it very much.
B003K15INU|5.0|The Swede, Levov, is the son of a Weequahic Jew. Blond and with a decidedly muscular build he becomes an indomitable force on he playing field which provides a bizarre, happy release for his Swedish innocence. Embraced  as a symbol of hope, covered by idolatrous adulation, he becomes strength and resolve deprived of deeper feeling.<br />The Kerr Avenue Jews, rough hewn, under-educated elders determined to raise a generation of striving, college educated sons, and Levov, blond, blue eyed son stood above the rest.  Levov's grandfather and father had given their lives to develop a world renowned commercial glove business. \\"Swede\\" expanded it further, married an Irish Catholic, Miss New Jersey beauty queen, bought land, and renovated a mansion. His wife defied all reason by developing an award winning herd of beef cattle. Their only child was a beautiful, very intelligent, charming girl.<br />He had longed for pastoral peace, everyman's dream which he worked and fought for, achieved only to discover everything suddenly going wrong. It was like sliding down a rabbit hole into utter chaos without any brakes. His once beautiful daughter rages furious violence. She commits murder and justifies her aberrations by turning his life upside down and inside out.<br />Everything the Swede believed to be true is revealed as a falsehood. His dream has become a waking nightmare of gigantic proportions. All his work has gone berserk, wrong becomes the norm, and faith in himself, in his family, friends and relatives is crushed beyond repair.<br />How could this happen in a sane world? As we learn, nothing matters anymore except the hidden and seductive force of insanity<br />Roth as Nathan Zuckerman has given us a well written, very emotional novel.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|It is hard to take a classic book like this and make it into a full-length feature without distorting it some way.  I would have like a lot more Danny Devito and less of the bad guy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. I play it all the time and I never get bored. Only boring people are bored. I don't care what bad things you hear.Temple run is flawless and awesome!
0743270754|5.0|Honestly, I consider this to be the best book I ever read.  The total picture of Lincoln's political life and an insight into other facets of his life, also, make the reader understand how this genius maintained control of his surroundings, maneuvered in and out countless political  and battlefield disasters.  I'd never understood the Civil War well, even having toured Gettysburg iteslf, and reading Goodwin's decsriptions opened my eyes to exactly why things happened as they did.  'Not one bit boring as one might expect an historical book to be at all.................Utterly fascinating and riveting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great read, Can't couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the movie now......to see the silver linings!!!!<br />Ready for that happy ending....mdk

B005LQ6UE8|4.0|A beautiful sensitive story of true courage. Well written and the plot moves right along, detailing the everyday struggles<br />to escape a prison camp - stay alive and reach their goal to obtain freedom away from Russia.
0345525558|4.0|This beautifully written novel takes on harsh notes with the hard reality of life for a foster child caught in the system.  And yet, at the same time it speaks into the depth of love, compassion, and most of all forgiveness and reconciliation brought about through a series of unlikely and very human connections.  However, the real genius of this story of redemption is the interweaving of &#34;the language of flowers&#34; that give voice to the child/woman and paints a new and unexpected reality of a patient and enduring sort. This book is worth the read and will quickly draw you in and give you pause to reflect on life.  It is a good book for a book group to read and discuss (which is exactly what our book group will be doing with it tomorrow!)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great program! Just got back with droid from apple. Just so I can use programs like this. Using a note2.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As a writer, I have a lot of appreciation for the structure of the story. It's tricky, but Flynn pulls it off. There are some holes and inconsistencies in the plot, but overall, it's a satisfying read. Great character voices.
B0091LS07E|3.0|received the cd promptly and it was as advertised. I wish I would have been able to hear the music. it was not the type of music that I like, however that was not the suppliers fault.
0743270754|5.0|Terrific, illuminating, well written. A masterpiece. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a fantastic historian. Lincoln is far more interesting than I imagined.

6304779607|4.0|Guns, exlposions and action! Cobra's another great Sylvester Stallone movie. He's always himself and doesn't care about how others think about him.<br /><br />Cobra's filled with action and suspense from beginning to end, it will have you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.<br /><br />For the low price of the movie, it's definately worth watching.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simple to download Wonderful quality. The entire series is spectacular. Being able to watch on the kindle fire is a bonus.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|the graphics are and believable, this movie is top notch in special effects and the story line is believable and easy to follow and very well written
B00867GHS8|5.0|I have literally lost count of the number of years I have waited for this to come out on Blu-ray, but suffice to say, IT'S FINALLY HERE! :) I love this movie, and having it in every version imaginable was the most sensible choice. (DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D & Digital versions all included)
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|this movie traces the Captain from his birth in World War II until modern days.  it shows the captain as he travels through time with his belief in America keeping  him company as a super patriot and a believer in right and wrong and the American way fighting Facism in the 40's until today.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The twist is not the one you'll start to figure out half way through the movie, oh no... not at all. I love movies that surprise you and make you say &#34;Ohhh, THAT'S why that happened!&#34; and everything still makes sense in the end :)
B008IGP8RI|3.0|I am not Susan Dobkins.  That's my sister.  I'm Bruce Robb. Please change the name on my account.  What's this word requirement?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Now I'm afraid what the movie will be like, but isn't that all books that become movies? It's worth the read...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game and it is fun to try and beat your friends scores and it is just a good game
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|The story is fairly straight forward with just a few twists, but the action is fun, and you grow to care about the characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife is addicted to this show.  I bought it for her and she watches it on her kindle fire HD every night.  She is always trying to tell me the plot and loves the characters.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The ship time was outstanding and the price was amazing for all three classics and the bonus DVD is a good collection.
0446618322|5.0|it was a great book, I have read the whole collection and it was wonderful, great book at a great price
B007DIQC90|5.0|I like The Killers, Grouplove, The National, Radiohead, Cold War Kids, and other similar groups. If you enjoy 3 or more of the groups I listed, you probably really like the album.  I think I paid $7 for a physical copy on Amazon.  So good price too.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Great movie, great story! It is a heartwarming story that gives me faith in humanity. Great family movie, be ready to cry!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|love the voice put into the book and how descriptive of the setting I feel like I can almost be walking through district 12 knowing where everything is and I can't wait to read \\"Catching Fire\\" and for that movie to be out! I would recommend this book to kids 13 and up or for any adult that loves happy endings with drama intense action. Love this book and hopefully this review was helpful to you if you are reading this. :D

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When i got all of the pages (i think the game lagged) i turned to slender man! i died after like 5 seconds what happend!?!
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|This book was alright.  That's all.  If I had to purchase it again I probably wouldn't. The romance wasn't developed enough for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game .it is the  perfect game for me because I have a horse my self<br />Having a horse is awesome but it is so hard and stressful . . Take my advice
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I know the labels rather cliche, but it is fun. Its more engaging then the first version (with I also own and play). For me the controls are easier and aren't as delayed as the first game. I'm not sure how many times i've 'died' on the first game because the motion was read incorrectly or did it too late.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I absolutely love having facebook right there when I want it.  I have never had any problems with it, works great!!!!!

B00AREIAI8|1.0|I loved the game the first time I played it but now it wont open. If I could get it to open I wouldngive it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and amazing you should really get this game because if you don't then you will be the only person that didn't have it then that will be sad
1416955070|2.0|I honestly didn't enjoy this book - ended up pushing myself to finish it.  For me, the main characters were irritating, the 'romance' tepid and cliche'd, and the world building as immature as the female lead.<br /><br />It gets tiring to read the tired bodice ripper standard:  female with spirit gets into trouble lots and alpha male, who constantly throws irritated bon mots, secretly wants her and saves her often (mostly from herself).  Throw in cookie cutter side characters and it feels like an overly long episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer - minus the wit.<br /><br />I believe this was a first book and perhaps her other books (in this series or other series) get better.  But sometimes it's nice to have a heroine who doesn't need an alpha male to rescue her (please, more Hunger Games Katniss and Peeta, less Angelfall Penryn and Rafe).<br /><br />So it wasn't a terrible book by any means, but it wasn't demanding of a reading and I've come to want something better in this genre.<br /><br />I give it two stars over one for the ending that switches the roles of the main characters.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I am just a click away from seeing my e-mail from my Kindle, But I wish there was a faster way to delete trash and junk mail.
B00422LESO|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. A book about going to a Jane Austen resort sounded perfect to me. I love anything and everything Jane Austen. However, I will admit that Pride and Prejudice and Mr. Darcy are not my favorites. If this book was about finding Captain Wentworth, then I'm all over it. But it's not. However, knowing that this book focused on Mr. Darcy, I still wanted to read it.<br /><br />I found as I was reading, I had mixed emotions. Did I really like this? Then I realized my emotions mirrored Jane's feelings on whether she really enjoyed Pembrook Park. When she was craving to be real again, so did I. When I started this book, I thought it would be amazing to go to Pembrook Park. Ms. Hale captured the boredom of the time period. Ladies and gentlemen were trapped in their own gentility. For the ladies, reading, embroidery and walks on the lawn were the other things available to occupy their time. I could completely understand Jane's boredom.<br /><br />The reality vs. fantasy was a little creepy, which, I think, was meant to be. Jane had such a difficult time accepting the fantasy, as I would. It's fun to play dress-up, but pretending to fall in love is something else. You could really empathize with Jane's disgust and frustration.<br /><br />The romance itself pretty much mirrored Pride and Prejudice. The question being would Jane find her version of Mr. Darcy? I won't say if she does but it was fun trying to figure it out. There were many men to choose from, but which one would cure Jane of her obsession. Or my question: does she need to be cured at all?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the ending. It is a quirky happily ever after for Jane. But does she end up with Mr. Darcy? Not telling! The book is a quick and enjoyable read. If you want something light and romantic, Austenland is waiting for you.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Young readers like me will love this book. Thank you for making an awesome ending for this book from Damon.
B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|Perhaps I'm unique or something about the way I position my head, but no matter what I do or how I try to adjust my Freestyle Snorkel, water fills in from the top.  At first I kept thinking that water was leaking in from somewhere else or the mouth piece, but then figured out that it was filling in from the top.  I tried adjusting the position and angle of my head, but no matter what I did, I still got water in.  I just ordered the standard FINIS snorkel along with the \\"dry top\\" to see if that works better.  I love being able to focus on my stroke and not on my breathing.  So, I'll keep looking for a solution
B00846REIS|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! It seems to start off like fifty shades, but makes some great twists, and turns. Highly recommend!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked how the story initially played out and there were some entertaining twists along the way, but ultimately the narrative petered out and the books ends with a whimper.  Worth reading, but save it for the airport.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|People... it's The (freakin) GODFATHER!! In BLU-RAY!! What more do you need to know? Have you been asleep since 1972??
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because it actually makes you think about your next move and makes you have fun at the same time. Its<br />actually the best temple run game ever and they should make a third one and I know there's only two temple run games but it's the best one out of the two.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is nowhere near survivalcraft and survival craft is just another minecraft knockoff and the screen is all ways upside down  no matter witch way I turn  the screen. Don't buy this horrid app! This is a stupid game.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This app is GREAT... but only if you own something other than a K.F! When I first got the app, I got onto it and the loading went on for about 10 minutes. I went off and then got back on, and it worked perfectly fine until it suddenly went back to the homescreen in the middle of the game! I tried again, same results. This is a NEW K.F!! If I were you,  I would NOT get this game if you own a K.F!!
0316224588|5.0|Before Rebus, Ian Rankin wrote books that weren't bad, they just weren't good. With Rebus, he found his voice. The first Rebus books were not great - I'm not a fan of serial killers, and think they are just lazy writing (a writer can fiddle out of coming up with a good plot with a serial killer) - but Rebus always has been that special character who takes on a life of his own. I read without putting them down - a new Rebus meant I was checked out of all activities until I closed it at the end. I became a Rebus/Rankin fan, and would buy his books as soon as they came out in the UK - a pretty spendy tribute. When Rebus retired, I still believed in Rankin, and bought the first post-Rankin book as before - full price, hard cover, postage to the U.S. And was I sorry. The man had lost his focus and it showed (and how any respectable reviewer could give that truly unworthy book a good review stuns me.) With Fox and the Complaints, he began to try and build a new character, although it was heavy going. I read them - after waiting for them to show up at the library - no more new hardcovers from U.K. - and decided I would be willing to read more, but from now on I would wait for the local library to get them in. Then I saw that Rebus was coming back, happy, happy. Still a little suspicious, I bought it new, hardcover, but waited for the U.S. edition. Having read it, I can say that Rankin's voice is, albeit a little rusty, coming back to him. Rebus continues to be a great character and Rankin is the man to channel him. I'm still not a big fan of serial killers, and I usually prefer only one false ending and one real ending over endless endings that aren't endings - that's a small quibble though. Rebus shines through. And Siobhan, incidentally, has developed over the years into an interesting and complex character also. I'm glad that Rankin didn't just try going on with her alone, it would have been a glass 3/4 empty. Together they work. Thank you, Ian Rankin, with all my heartfor giving me a good read. I've missed you and I'm happy to see you again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I appreciate and value the patriotic souls of all our military personnel. This look into the soul of Chris Kyle, his mindset, and his devotion to America is enlightening. Personally speaking this book gave me insight into my own sons experiences as a marine in Afghanistan and Fallugah. It saddened me deeply to read the breaking news of Chris's death while reading this autobiography. God bless his wife and family, my prayers and indebtedness will be with you always.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've never gone wrong with a Grisham book! This was up to his usual high standards. Lots of excitement and you don't want to put it down!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|A rare book in that it works simply as an adventure story for young readers (not too young though, the book is relatively challenging) while providing advanced readers with a rich, anthropological look into the spirit and culture of mankind. Highly imaginative and emotional, a great book!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I felt as if I was going through this operation with the Navy Seals. I admire the bravery of the soldier who told this story.  As Americans, we all need to know this true story of the death of the monster called BinLaden, and the sacrifices of the true heroes who were responsible for &#34;Really&#34; taking him down.
0425252868|5.0|A story that reminds us that men can still be human during the heat of war. Many of that generation would and still do not talk of the horrors they lived endured. These two men finally did and gave hope to all that have followed that peace of mind and spirit can still be possible. A great read for all.
B00006690G|5.0|First time I've listened to Eminem (besides Stan with Dido). I'm 60 years-old and I loved it! Listened to it in my truck on an hour drive (which wasn't long enough to listen in one sitting). I listen to all kinds of music...opera, rock, country. I don't dislike rap but I don't listen to it very much. Got this from the library and thought I would give it a try. I can understand why he is liked so much. Great beat...could hardly stop bobbing my head. I listened to it while driving...windows down...bass beating. Felt like a gangsta! The lyrics can certainly offend many people but I took it as a history lesson of what young people are up too. I think the guy is a genius. The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV. Every generation has somebody that they try to stop from getting messages to the young folk. It is his story and he is telling it his way. I've met people who think they shouldn't cuss on war shows...that they don't need it. It is because of that, that people think war is gallant and heroic (which sometimes it can be). Instead they need to be showing people screaming, cussing when their leg is blown off - that is real. Why would you want to edit it? Eminem is telling his story his way. It is his emotions pouring out in his song. If you don't like it then don't buy it. Don't ban it. This is a really good album. I just listened to it again yesterday whilst walking. I was able to really concentrate on the lyrics. Give it a chance older folks! To me this is every bit as classic \\"album\\" as Dark Side of the Moon, Days of Future Passed and Take Five. Loved it!
B008LC8TJI|4.0|this is a really good CD. Please be aware there are some &#34;salty&#34; lyrics on a few of the songs.  This is a great CD to listen to while getting ready for a night out or on the way to the beach.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|When looking for the days weather or for the week ahead, this is the place I look first. I love the look, the layout and the information. The graphics are wonderful with everything from blue skies, to rain, snow, ice and dark skies filled with stars. You'll find windchill and humidity, as well as wind speed and direction. It's perfect!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so addicting!! I love it! It is better than Temple Run 1 because it has more variety and it has amazing graphics. You  should totally get it!!
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This movie displays in much detail the journey into addiction(s) and how a person loses touch with reality in a slow but unstoppable way.
B00BCA29WY|5.0|I am not a music critic. I know what I like, and I love this. Read the previous 5 star reviews if you want, but I recommend that you just listen. This is Progressive Rock at its finest and freshest. You will not regret this purchase.<br /><br />The band is looking for enough interest in America to bring the tour here. Let's show them that there are enough Americans with the good taste to appreciate this remarkable effort.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Thank you Christopher Nolan for this amazing Batman Series! Got this for my brother for Christmas and he loved it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was hilarious!<br />I thought the acapella singing was perfect as well as the story line. Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Rebel Wilson and the rest of the ensemble as well as the crew did a great job at making this story come to life.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The post war era presents issues that threaten the stability of the titled family at Downton. Tom Is determined to risk his and Sybil's life by moving to Dublin and participating in the Irish revolution. The women's rights movement becomes an issue at Downton when a daughter becomes actively involved and a former maid is forced to prostitution to support herself and her son. When the stability of the old faces the future, explosive drama ensues. This series is fast moving and poignant.
B005HSL626|2.0|Fruit Ninja is a fun game for the kids, but I wouldn't recommend the free version.  The ad placement is done in a way where the kids are always accidentally clicking on the ads, which with kids place doesn't matter, except for the fact that they get frustrated and stop playing.

B0061S073A|4.0|Overall this is a good product for locking down the kindle fire for kids.  The only issue we have with it is it tends to crash a lot, which requires a hard reboot of the kindle.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We really enjoy this game much like Were's my Water? We love Perry Platypus Character. That makes the game more interesting and a fun app We enjoy this game and play it everyday! Wondering and hoping are you going to add more levels. I really enjoy how secrets can be found and then to open new levels or different types of game play.  Keep up the good work!
B008MEM24S|5.0|The kids love this game.  There are varying difficulties which keeps it interesting for them.  All of the puzzles are solvable for the kids, so they keep coming back.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|I had heard of Tony ( And Zappos-As a Customer) over the years and may have even waited on him during my many Years working in one of Las Vegas'Posh High End Resturants as a Waiter! A little under two years ago I was fortunate enough to take the Tour of the Zappo's Facility in Henderson, Nevada. During my tour of Zappo's I experienced first hand the culture of the company, the employees were happy, helpful and jovial. The energy of the environment was contagious, it just seemed to have this overall good feeling, and it oozed that everyone employee there really wanted to be there. Every single interaction that I encountered was positive and helpful, especially upon my exit when I was allowed to take more than one book which I will expand on in just a minute. As for the book, in my honest and humble opinion its a must read for anyone who is either starting a company or looking to expand and grow their current company. At certain points in the book I could feel my heart race with worry, Are they going to make it, will they fail or will they finally decide to just quit and eliminate all the down side risk? The book is an honest inside perspective to all the trial and tribulations that Tony and the entire Zappo's team went through over the years! And the best part is, well just read the book, because I don't want to spoil it for you the reader! Its well worth the investment of money and time. As I mentioned I was lucky enough to take the tour of the Zappo's company, Which I LOVED, I wanted to take a second tour from a sheer education stand point, my tour guide obviously watched me take notes and ask lots of questions throughout my time with her on the tour, so much to my advantage when the tour concluded and I was in the Zappo's Library ( like a Kid in a Candy Store)perusing all the great book titles, the Guide allowed me to have a second book to take home and enjoy! The Zappo's Company over delivered to me as a customer, client and business owner, therefore I safely and proudly endorse Tony Hsieh and Delivering Happiness! Happy Reading<br /><br />Martin J.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|The story is very good, because it's not your run of the mill story, that we tend to see in fantasy. Although most of the key elements we do see are there such as the young prodigy that excels at everything, but what is what truly sets this book apart is the way its written. I really can't wrap my mind around exactly what it is, maybe its the way the author seems to really take advantage of Kvothe wit! It;s just truly awesome, I wish I could give a better review.

B000MV9026|1.0|A few cute scenes in the beginning, the voices are cute, but goes totally downhill from there.  I agree with others, that there was very poor character development.  I couldn't click in with one of them.<br /><br /> The zoo scene bothered me the most, very disturbing!  And the sexism and sexual innuendoes and heavy judgments from the main penguins father and entire social community ostracizing him are terrible.  The character, we are suppose to like, Mondo or how ever you spell his name.....Well how he teats the female penguin that likes him is immature and terrible.  All very disturbing. Not a good example for kids or adults and I don't even have kids.<br /><br /> They wanted to give a political message in this movie, but they could have done this in a much better way.  It was cheapened down, not fun OR intellectual.  I bought this movie as I though it would be uplifting.  I was not happy...

B007FEFLTO|2.0|This book is as ideologically charged as the first book of the trilogy, it is an apollogy for comunism and european socialist ideals, although it has some entertaining parts, but unless you have a lot of spare time its not worth reading.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Look, on an average caper, let's say some mad scientist trying to take over the world with some big-time one- size- fits- all invention and is just missing one little exotic thing, or some bad guys, maybe a drug cartel, are trying to dope up the world, and want an exclusive, unencumbered franchise or, maybe , some guy, some off- the- wall political guy, who never heard of Hitler or Tojo and who runs a place like Ruthenia wants to flex his muscle and exercise his army,  you only really need one larger than life super-hero, max. But when they, the aliens (from outer space or maybe just Moslems or something), want to come to the good green earth and take it over, then wait a minute, then you better call on the services of every super-hero who still draws, or is still capable of drawing, breath, no question. Guys like Agent so and so, the dishy gymnast flip dame with the Russian name, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, guys with big thrust arrows, and hell, even the Hulk for some beef so they, those aliens know, or show be on notice to know, that there is going to be hell to pay if someone other than earthlings want to wantonly exploit the earth 's resources.<br /><br />And that little idea, that little band of brave brothers and sisters (and their support structure) saving the day against some neurotic Loki from who knows where and his mercenary army ready to proclaim himself king of the hill is what drives this very long, action- packed film. Of course, like in all professions, professions that have super-stars anyway, the collective does not gel right off so there is the usual bickering and working at cross-purposes before everybody gets on the team. And then watch out because no way is some half-mad Loki (and some kin to Thor, of all people) going to take his massive, seemingly never-ending and well-equipped army against the good folks of New Jack City (hey, haven't those citizens had enough lately why not pick on say, Charleston , South Carolina or some place like that) without a fight to the finish, And there you have it. Oh, except this thought, if the American government hired this little heroic band then that seven hundred billion defense budget could be reduced to the price of airfare and a new change of clothes. Watch this one while waiting out a snowstorm like I did.

B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Much has been said about this album, so I won't waste anyone's time with more raving about each track. However, I do want to mention my perspective on this album. Riverside has proven once again that they are in world all their own: they do what they want. It's as simple as that.<br /><br />\\"Shrine of New Generation Slaves\\" is a perfect example of this fact. SONGS has been correctly described as being somewhere between the Reality Dream trilogy and ADHD. Yet, I cannot shake the feeling that Mariusz Duda's solo project, Lunatic Soul, has influenced this new album immensely. Whether it be the spacey xylophone, the slow moody segments, or the signature song structures; Lunatic Soul is found throughout the album. In fact, the bonus disc Night Sessions tracks (excellent editions, by the way) seem like they are straight off of Lunatic Soul's \\"Impressions\\". While some may complain about this, I welcome it immensely. It seems that Riverside is becoming slightly more eclectic, less metallic (why are they listed under progressive metal?), and even more original.<br /><br />As to the musicianship, SONGS delivers. Duda wows with his vocals and especially with his intense and intricate bass lines. The keyboards also really shine on this album as they range from a 70's texture to piano passages to more neo-prog styles. As usual, the guitar work is also phenomenal, and this is just as varied as the keyboards. I've never heard Piotr perform such soulful solos as on SONGS. Lastly, the drums are well done (I was very impressed in a few spots), but I still would love to see them taken up a notch or two.<br /><br />Finally, I think my favorite thing about this album is the theme. Themes and lyrics are very important to me, and Duda really outdid himself here. The theme of new age slaves is riveting as we see first world citizens that are chained mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Slaves to religion, to broken relationships, to materialism, and to other issues are all emotionally explored. This album is nothing short of powerful. \\"We never talk when we fall apart\\"...<br /><br />Currently, I would have to say my favorite tracks are \\"The Depth of Self-Delusion\\", \\"We Got Used to Us\\", \\"Deprived\\", and the epic \\"Escalator Shrine\\". Yet, I know this will shift as I discover this album more and more. Overall, Riverside has delivered a game changer once again, and I encourage everyone to join the ride.xplored.

B000LPS4BG|3.0|The original release of Goodfellas on blu ray is a 5 star movie given a 1 star treatment by Warner Brothers who seem to disrespect almost all their releases on Blu Ray.  For the classic, 'Goodfellas', I cried with disappointment. The mbps ranged from the low teens to the low twenties and the video transfer shows no significant improvement over my Standard Def version. The audio was also lossy  5.1 with everything coming through the center channel and nothing in the surrounds or LFE; and again we have paid for a superior product of a superior movie and not received what we paid for.<br /><br />The video transfer appeared to be the same as my Standard Def DVD with some grain throughout tho there is no artifacting that I could see. The disc stopped playing at the end of the scene early in the movie between when he comes out of court and then is shown as a grownup Ray Liota. I backed the disc up and played it again, this time not stalling out.  There was some video resolution improvement especially in the brighter areas where the contrast and facial tones appear a touch better than the standard def version but it is not a dramatic improvement by any means.<br />In my opinion, if you already had the Standard Def version of this fine film, you really wouldn't gain much by going to the BluRay version.<br /><br />With this Anniversary Edition of Goodfellas we do see certain marked improvements. The one I received was a one disc edition with no extras.<br />The 4K scan of the video presents the imaging as it should have always been with excellent color grading, sharp contrast and deep blacks. Small details in even the darker scenes are clearly discernible.  Mbps rate averaged in the high 20's to low 30's.<br /><br />However, they clearly screwed up the audio even for this remastering and lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio codec with very poor use of the surrounds, soundtrack songs are clearly front loaded with, especially during the first half of the film, the singers always steered towards the right front channel with little stereo separation. About half way through the film the overall volume seemed to rise but the soundtrack stereo separation was more apparent.  Very little use of the sub and what there was was not very deep.  A very lousy job of audio editing is all I can point to on this.<br /><br />Never the less, this Anniversary edition is heads and tails above what you got with the Standard Def DVD and the original release of the Blu Ray.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksth little stereo separation.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first I thought this book would be more for young adult readers, but was happy to find out i was wrong. A quick read, but kept my attention and truly enjoyed. There were many twists and suspenseful moments. I would recommend to those who enjoy a good love story with some mystery.
B004ZJZQCE|4.0|This movie had been produced sometime ago and yet it still has legs and is an exciting and tense worthwhile film.  I don't provide opinions on the movies, the acting or give summaries of each film. That has been done many times elsewhere so I just provide information regarding the transfer of each of these film's from Standard Definition to this current Blu Ray.<br /><br />I do have the Standard Def version so, while this is not a direct comparison between the two formats, I can refer to it.  The video transfer to Blu Ray is really superb with excellent contrast and coloration, little to no grain and no artifacts of any kind.  It seemed to me, early in the film, the Richard Gere's skin tone was a touch too tan for a man who had been in prison for a long time but other than that, this movie looks just beautiful.  The mbps rate ranges between the mid 20's and mid 30's which is a pretty decent bit rate.  The video transfer is definitely the star of this BluRay combo.<br /><br />The Standard Def DVD, which I did not watch as I already had my original copy on a separate DVD, is, I think, unfortunately on the opposite side of the BluRay copy.  This is not a 2 disc set.  I don't know if having it on the other side is a problem.  I can attest that the BluRay side is clearly, very good.<br />The extras are on the Standard Def side which has the same static menu as the original release did.  It contains commentary and a making of documentary.  Typical stuff.  No deleted scenes which I often enjoy.  The digital copy is a download that you do once you enter the code.  I didn't bother with this.<br /><br />The audio transfer to the Blu Ray DVD was really quite good though not a disc to really show off what  your surrounds can pump up.  The lossless  DTS HD MA 5.1 audio is clean and crystal clear.  The surrounds are used primarily for ambience either in action or score but there is really very little use, if any, for discreet directionality of front and rear channels. Thus, I lowered the star rating to 4.  Most of the audio will be coming from your center channel speaker but the lossless audio does tend to envelope you in the action and that is a good thing.<br /><br />The price of the BluRay is certainly a good one and this is a movie that would be worth upgrading to BluRay should you already have it on Standard Def.  Wish I could say that about all the movies I have upgraded to.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksered the star rating to 4.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this book. Thought I wouldn't like it due to the subject matter but having the story told in the child's perspective was really good. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. Very easy to become engrossed in and to read!!!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Fantastic CD!  I keep listening to it again and again, but never get tired of it.  The songs are varied in style, but almost every song is excellent.

B000N3ST7A|5.0|steveie nicks produces another fine album of hits, some new some from her past collections. a wonderful drift into the muse of music
B008FSCNTK|2.0|We have all of Diana Krall's albums. This was a very disappointing. Not even close to her style of music that we have loved for years.
0062082353|1.0|I have a hard time with profiting off killing people. There is something fundamentally wrong with this. Especially in a war where we were an occupying army. While we considered them the enemy and apparently had no qualms with picking them off with pot shots, in their own eyes they were just ordinary people that believed they were defending their country in the only way they knew how. I don't blame the soldier but we should never celebrate high kill ratios with best sellers, but I suppose that is human nature.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Interesting to envision a time when the fate of the world lies in the hands of children. This story moved along well despite missing background on the inner workings of the government, the lack of which left some parts of the book confusing. I would also have liked more character development. Good read overall.
B0026772N8|5.0|I just love the book. I had the paper version, but wanted to have it with me wherever I go.<br /><br />Not an easy read, though, but it opens many questions about modern society ... phylosophy interspersed with everyday life
B00992CF6W|5.0|Purchased this for my grandson's Kindle and he is delighted with it.  The graphics are sharp and easy to use the controls (according to him).  This one  is one that we don't mind him playing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire 50 shades trilogy was fantastic.  It has a bad rep for the many scenes in it.  It really is more about relationships, emotions and more.  It made me laugh, cry, and several emotions in between.  She is now my favorite author and I look forward to more from her.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed Dr. Alexander's book, and would recommend it to others, especially Christians who seem to have anxiety about death or who are facing death. I do believe the author when he describes his experience, and I found the science interesting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I think this book belongs in the category of Vision, and I would not be willing to make his experience universal (I'm not sure he would, either). Theologically, I also believe his view of evil and free will are somewhat facile.<br /><br />Negativity aside, however, I do not believe a Christian would be hurt by reading even the aspects of this book which are unorthodox, and, indeed, I think it is overwhelmingly helpful and uplifting in its tone, and in its scientific but not-overly-pedantic viewpoint.<br /><br />The way Alexander relates his NDE to his own biography is especially moving. I recommend this book, but caution against accepting it as some sort of scripture. It is an aid, not a primary source upon which others should base their own experience or expectation.

Most books I have read on the subject leave me wondering what exactly they were talking about.  This book leaves me wondering why everybody else didn't write a book like this one!<br /><br />The technical details are there, explaining how and why to apply various treatments and how to get the effect desired.  There are tons of examples, and even links to multi-track bits so you can try it out for yourself.  Before reading this book, my mixes fetched comments like \\"Uhh, yeah it's OK...\\".  My very next mix after reading this book the comments were \\"Wow!  That sounds professional!\\".<br /><br />Buy this book.  Trust me.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|Very good game.  Can get hooked on it pretty fast.  Hard to put down once you start playing it.  Great
B008M721MS|1.0|I thought this would work on a regular kindle, but it does not. You have to have a Kindle HD to use it. Oh well.
1442444053|1.0|The only reason I read this at all was that it was assigned to me as a student. Other reviewers have pointed out that some books are better appreciated by an older rather than younger audience, but I can't imagine that being the case with this book. It was boring, monotonous, and devoid of any action whatsoever. A large slab of the book if I remember rightly, was devoted to descriptions of defecation.<br /><br />I can't imagine that I would appreciate it any better as an adult, and I will not be wasting my time trying to find out.
B008Q6SML4|5.0|I have so much on my plate that I really don't have much time to read so this audio book was great.  I loved the way they put the characters together, it made it seem like you were right there with them reliving their stories.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoy books about zombies.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I found the storyline of Game of Thrones to be captivating and applaud HBO for ensuring that the art direction coincides with this eptic tale.  The selection of actors chosen to portray each character is spot on. HBO did such a magnificent job  in protraying this story that it has led me to reading the books, pre-ording Season 2 DVD and ordering HBO to watch Season 3.
0142418471|5.0|Such a great book, unpredictable, and hilarious.<br />Complete with science, musical and band references. The characters will capture your heart, each of them different but fabulous in their own weird way. It's a fun, light read despite dealing with tough issues like living with depression, dealing with homophobia, and finding friendship.

B004UJTG6Q|2.0|Not formatted very well for Kindle..  Strange charts and lists of chapters and sections were very confusing.  I must have read a children's (abridged) version years ago, since I can't recall certain events in the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. I learned a lot that I missed in the movie. Anxious to move onto the rest of the series.

It's decent for what it is, and might succeed in getting them some new fans, but I think a lot of old T+S fans will be disappointed.

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I have been a Bond fan starting with The Spy Who Loved me and found this to be one of the best Bond films.  The plot isn't over complex but the film is very well made and Daniel Craig plays the part well.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love this CD, is on of my favorite Christmas CD's. I have his first Christmas CD but he didnt have very many songs on it, this one has a lot more and we love it
B007FTZDN8|4.0|....It crashed my kindle functioning. Reluctantly, I had to take it off because I had really enjoyed the few lectures I got to watch before it crashed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game man u need to get this if u don't ur a chump man oh yea I'm am bitw
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great storyline with an engaging and endearing hero who's just a normal engineering nerd you can't help cheering for.  Makes one appreciate the intricacies of space travel and habitation and fires the imagination and longing for adventure- Also makes me sad for our currently stagnated space program--the most unbelievable part of the story is that JPL and NASA will still be around Lets hope they are and our kids keep reaching for<br />the stars
1401937268|5.0|I'm just going to get to the gist of it. These cards are just simply amazing! Coming from someone who was just drawn to tarot reading by god and began practicing with simple cards ( like the Spanish playing cards) i can say that after i practice with these a bit and tune into its energy, it was just simply magical! The cards started speaking to me and to the people i did readings to and it was just so insightful, deep, meaningful, and of course accurate! It even showed how the person felt, even though they didn't realize it themselves! It made them feel happy, positive, and gave them huge tips on how to improve their life! It was nice, friendly, and no negativity was even detected! Even though the negative cards popped out, they still infused us with positive energy. It was simply stunning!<br /><br />I always believe that even if the cards have its own meaning, the reader itself must find its true meaning pertaining to the cards. But when i use these cards, it feels just like that. It feels like i am in control and connected plus guided all the way. Sometimes i might get stuck, but the extra information it gives off on the card and book itself helps me unblock my mind and find the right words to say to the people. For me, it's everything i could ask for. I am an Empath and the energy is what I focus most on. When I use these cards, the energy i get from them suits me well; especially since the Spanish decks gave me tons of negativity that it even began to hurt me physically! These cards just remove all of that negativity i gained when i did the readings and helped us BOTH feel happy and positive! Don't get me wrong, it does reveal the negative effects to me a lot, but at least it says it in a gentle and positive way. Meaning it won't hurt us both and it will help us both understand what to do to avoid such misery. So yeah, you are still getting the negative outcomes in your client's path, you just have to feel it and put it into place like any other deck. Remember, these decks are tools to help out our abilities and get the answers we seek!<br /><br />I might be new to tarot reading, but I think I did the right choice in choosing these cards. They called out to me the second I saw the box itself and once I saw all the cards I knew I had to have it. It was meant to be in my opinion. If you like these cards and if you feel like these are the cards for you than go for it! Follow your intuition and let the cards choose you!<br /><br />PS. Most importantly, their GORGEOUS! I am sorry, but not everything is going to be perfect! Enjoy what you get... I know some cards might come out as a meh but honestly, its fine! We aren't perfect so why should the cards be perfect? I rather have it this way, just simply magical. I love it!these decks are tools to help out our abilities and get the answers we seek!<br /><br />I might be new to tarot reading, but I think I did the right choice in choosing these cards.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Kept my interest.  Moved fast . Found some of the technical details confusing.  Whole concept of cyber warfare quite scary.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game great fun with my sister to teachers her simple stuff about horses and tack. Lots of fun but wish all the cute stuff didn't require gems
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DOWNTON ABBEY This is the best show on TV - I just LOVE IT. I know it is not from Season 3 but Maggie Smith saying &#34;what is a weekend? &#34;  in the First Season is what got me
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I love Agatha Christie books. This one really had me guessing. It's a great mystery. I highly recommend this to any lovers of good mysteries.
B006H5120E|5.0|Do you remember in like 1980 we used to love Titanic? Well now it comes out in 3D which is NECESSARY!!!!!!!!!!!!! The 3D for  this movie is amazing, mostly if you have surround sound.<br /><br />MUST BUY!!!!!
B007N8RULO|4.0|large easy to see this screen is bright, cards move fast, can undo with ease. I would recommend this game
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that is full of laughter, surprises, and funny animation. Your family will love this movie. There is lots of singing and twists. I especially love the Grandma!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it could be worked a tad but its pretty good. it needs more abilities and more ways to get free coins
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I love the Hunger Games book series, and I love the movie even MORE!!!!!!!!! (I can't believe I'm saying this.) All the action and suspense from the books comes alive in this movie, and the movie is 10 times better in Blu-ray and with a surround sound system. Even though many parts of the movie are violent, there's not too many bloody and gory parts UP CLOSE. Don't get me wrong, the Hunger Games is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of blood.<br /><br />If you have read the Hunger Games, you MUST BUY this movie. If you have not, you still MUST BUY this movie.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I don't know why it did that but its either my kindle or the app. they both have problems. They better give me my stuff back!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a remarkable testimony. I read Raymond Moody back in the seventies and any other books on the subject that I could find. I have not had an NDE per say, but I have lived post full body radiation as a teenager in the early 70's. I have not met other survivors of that nor have the many doctors I have to see today. I always felt that there was life after death, and that I tap into that energy in some way. This book was great because it is readable even though the writer is a scientist. It is believable; all accounts I have read were not. It does not center around a particular religion or dogma which would totally make it suspect. And it has some things to try. Usually it is the people who do not need convincing that read books about life after death, but I recommend it especially to people that are too narrow minded to consider a belief other than their own. The book is interesting and I read it straight through. For me, it was a real page turner.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|This is the second book of Michael Connelly's that I have read. Growing up in Los Angeles and having worked for CHP I can relate to some of the references. But that means nothing if the writing is no good. Fortunately, the writing is good. I found myself reading when I only had a few minutes or when I should have gone to bed. I read multiple books at the same time but the better book will win out for my time. This one did. The plot and characters were interesting to me. I will continue to read Connelly's 'Harry' and see if he grows as a character or remains stagnant. A author can get boring if they stick too much to the same formula. Hopefully Connelly will keep my interest.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fantastic, so good I could hardly put it down. Very good! Cant' wait for another book from this author. I expect I will read other books by John Grisham to see how they compare because Racketee read like a script for a movie. The author keeps you interested as to what is going to happen next.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Game gives extras as each puzzle is completed. I like playing more without the timer. It's fun to change the look of the board and characters.
B009M8TA20|5.0|I admire Zlatan to be so honest and open in his book, never afraid to critisize anyone or anybody just like he is on the football pitch. Playing for such top sides gives Zlatan load of experiences to tell with his own typical way that surely keeps his readers pleased
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Like science fiction? Haven't watched the Alien film series? Or maybe you have watched them but don't own them yet. Either way it doesn't matter. BUY THIS NOW! YOU NEED IT!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is really fun and I like it a lot. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horses.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite science fiction movies of all time. If you haven't watched it yet, you're missing out. Buy it now!!!
0756666937|5.0|Another requested Christmas gift for a boy who builds with Legos constantly.  He seemed very pleased to receive it, I'm waiting to see the results.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|This movie failed at what made the first Boondock Saints great. The corny country chick and the goofy sidekick were so cheesy I couldn't even bare watching them. If there is a third movie, I hope they've been killed off or something because they are absolutely terrible.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The only thing bad is that you cant listen to your own music while playing it. the valume is turned way up to maximum. but if you don't mind having your ears explode if you want to listen to your music its a great app!
B009369Z8A|4.0|I liked it. Probably not worth owning unless you're a hillbilly who gets drunk off moonshine all the time and loves resisting law enforcement. Lol. Worth watching once but that's about it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is so amazing!! If you like to design bulidings or get chased by zombies this is the game for you!! It is worth the $6.99!!!!!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|AWESOME FILM!!! THE MOVIE WAS SO GOOD I'M DOING THIS WHOLE REVIEW IN ALL CAPS! THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY WORTH OWNING AND WATCHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUY IT NOW!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|don't waste your time. froze up after I had worked for days to get all the bonuses and upgrades and completely stopped working. had to uninstall and lost everything
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This is my favorite horror/comedy film. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. The two main characters are what make this film as great as it is. Buy it!!!
B0044XV3R8|4.0|The movie was great.  I didn't remember buying used, but I guess I did.  It was obviously gently used, but the discs worked fine.  No issues.  Came much faster than expected.  Would have been nice to have a more accurate arrival date since it was a gift for another household member and he is the one who found it in the mail.
B001P9KR94|4.0|For me, this is one of those films that is worth watching once and then shelving for a decade or two and then pulling it back out to watch it again since you've forgotten everything that happens in this movie.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you like the dark Nolan Batman, this next chapter of the Batman will not disappoint.  I am sure most of us that have wanted to see this movie already have, but for those holdouts.  It's a good story.  This is not HSM this is Batman so it is dark and violent.
B005LAII8K|5.0|This movie is unlike any other movie out there. For that reason alone it is worth watching. Buy it now!
0547258305|3.0|I was a little scared of picking up Graceling because I was scared it wasn't going to live up to the hype and the raving reviews that still keep popping up. But upon reading it, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot is fast-paced and exciting, the world magical and exciting, and the writing easy to absorb. The romance, too, was great - subtle, and barely-there until towards the end, and didn't take front-seat. It would've been the perfect fantasy novel, and was, all the way up until the point where Katsa 'rediscovers' her own Grace. *cues the sound of crumbling buildings* And, from there, Katsa's once kick-ass, exciting character dissolves into everyone's least-favorite Mary-Sue.<br /><br />It wasn't by any means terrible or bad, but it became harder to get into and enjoy as Katsa's character changed from awesome to not-so-great.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I found this film to be about as good as the original one that is set on Mars. Probably not a movie I would ever watch again, but it is worth watching once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Gameplay is simple and addicting and fun for casual playing. I've found myself sitting for hours on just one more game.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I don't understand why people love to hate on this film. I thought it was awesome! If you like the Alien movies then you should love this! Buy it!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I would give this program additional stars if at all possible.  I am a fan of the BBC and this is certainly one of its vintage gems.  I heard it's what &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; was based upon & if that's true, I wouldn't be at all surprised.  The costume design is breath-taking, the stories timely and the characters so real that you feel you know them.  Just make sure you set aside ample time as you will probably want to watch whole clusters of episodes back-to-back.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This really is the ultimate collection for any fan of the Matrix. This is one of my favorite film series which makes this blu-ray movie collection a must have! Buy it!
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles is always ok .  I have not rec'd this yet.  I know what the old  vynl sounded like, supurb!.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of my all time favorite movies. Why? I don't know. It just is! I love every second of it. If you haven't seen it or don't own it, then buy it now!!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Epic hack and slash works much faster on the tablet then on my android<br />It would be nice to have been able to upload my saved data from my phone app and start from there on here
B0026FCNK2|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. Not my favorite science fiction movie, but definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the genre.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Graphics are gorgeous and so realistic. It's like you are really working with the materials (glass, wood, fabric, etcetera). I would recommend this one for kids as young as five to adults of all ages. Easy to get lost in this fun puzzler!
B0085A9HXS|3.0|This movie got old pretty fast. If you're looking for a nonstop action movie then this is for you. But besides that, the move wasn't that great. I couldn't bring myself to even care about the characters or story in general because I found them lacking, which made me not care too much about the movie as a whole. Sorry, but I don't think I would ever watch this movie again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|covers a lot in one series but very informative; looking forward to the next episode and future episodes for another year.
B007XF0X16|5.0|This movie was epic. For a Greek mythology movie I would say this beats its predecessor \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and even the movie \\"Immortals\\". I wish \\"Clash of the Titans\\" had been as good as this movie. If you like Greek mythology and an awesome action/adventure movie then this is for you!
B0043URV5U|5.0|have always loved bob seger, every song on this cd set is one of his best known hits except for the christmas song, that should have been on a christmas album not this one, so missing out on a good song that could have been on here. love christmas music but not so much at other times of year but worth it to buy
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Vegas baby ! Imagine waking up and finding a ring on your finger and a man who says he's your husband and you don't remember even his name. Well that's what happens when in Vegas. Connor her new husband is happy to have her as his wife she is everything he wanted a partner without emotional ties. She is not so happy, she was just going to the sperm bank to get her prego on and stay  very unattached to a man, they only leave you anyway. How did this happen, annulment time ! He challenges her to try it for three months, in his beach house in San Diego. (sign me up) He is gorgeous, knows how to wear a tux, has made a fortune and has no interest in love.<br />It was predictable and yet I couldn't tear myself away from the drama of these two. They are damaged and they don't even know it till they have to try to live together. A quick enjoyable romance.
B005EVVESM|4.0|didn't ever hear much of maroon 5 until the show &#34;the voice&#34;. for some reason i thought they were more rock (like hard rock) which i don't like, this i like and have bought several of their cds now, love Adam's voice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game when we are traveling or just hanging out at home. It is so much fun when you are playing against friends, too. Worth more like three Dolores because its so fun!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game its addicting but worth it I don't play any other bingo game but this one I have no issues like I do with facebook no freezing or glitches
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this this game. Wish I knew how to get more gems more quickly.  My favorite thing to do is feed the horses.
B0006J28BO|5.0|What I liked about this movie was how simple and straight-forward it was. A heartwarming tale with a good message to boot, the humor and character development that goes on in the movie never disappointed me.
B008OHV5C8|5.0|great to see a group that has been around for a while and can still put out an album that might be their very best. highly recommended if you are new to the trio, or are a longtime fan.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Worthwhile animation and good storyline ----- clever and creative. Even if you don't have kids, worth watching. Ellen Degeneris' as Dora is best of all.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|This is the guy that made aliens. Nuff said. It is scary and cool. Wish they had a part two.
0765325950|5.0|It's very difficult to write a book where pretty much all the characters either must die or succeed in a task that an entire series set up to be mammoth. They managed it very well.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I watched it over and over, great acting. I have heard the original speech and I really believed it was the king.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Its a lot of fun. It has a lot of great graphics and cool other stuff.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|worked the first time now it will not work. so don't get it unless you really want to only play it on time
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A wonderful glance of the other side the voyage of the doctor is a proof to the after life that is not dominated by religious dogma, very tefreshing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever!!!! buy it now don't let the price change ur mind its SO worth it don't wait! !!!!!!!! GET THIS APP! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Awesome read!  Wanted to read this for months & finally had time only to end up putting everything else on hold.  Loved the circus and the book too!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Intriguing book written from a child's perspective.  Subject matter is disturbing but because it is told through the eyes of a child, you are forced to set what you previously deemed right or wrong aside and hear the story through the child's innocent voice.  I enjoyed the book certainly not because it was entertaining but because it challenged my thinking.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This was a hit.  It is a great way to pass the time and it is even more addictive than the original.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Very glad I bought this CD. The songs are a blend of old and new to me. Laurie's voice is not my favorite, but his joy in the singing and playing overrides that. The passion he feels for the music comes through. I am no music critic, nor even very knowledgeable, I know what I like though, and I like this.
0525478817|3.0|I bought this book to pass the time on a recent trip.  While traveling, I typically buy books for my Kindle that both I and my 20-year-old daughter will like.  This one seemed to fit the bill:  Teen love and teen angst for her and relatively positive reviews for me.  It was not a terrible book, although both my daughter and I decided we could easily have just read the first and last pages.  It was completely predictable.  The unrealistic banter between the 2 teenage protagonists felt sort of contrived, but that seems to be the fashion in teen literature these days, so I was hip with it.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is indeed a great movie, although lacking more actions.<br /><br />Danzel is great as always, but I find that there is too much talk and not enough action.<br /><br />Beware, this movie has Nudity, Alcohol and plenty of Drug use, but a very good message at the end.<br /><br />This movie could of gone without a couple of scenes (especially the opening scene), but overall, Good movie.
1608871452|5.0|A 'MUST HAVE' for any Supernatural fan!!! Full of interesting facts, interviews, and information. Beautiful pictures. Plus interesting little extras. I spent hours with this book. Will probably spend a lot more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can play it all day. This game has me hooked. lol. Ive been trying to beat high scores since I've. had. it. lol
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. It's a quick read and fun. I especially liked the planetary exploration and Martian environment survival science. It was also fun to follow the protagonist's trek across Mars using Google Mars.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|This is a three album set for the diehard Enigma fan.  Disc One is an assortment of classic tracks; Disc Two is an eclectic collection of remixes, most of them as stunning as the originals.  Disc Three takes things a step further.  If you love Enigma, you'll love this set.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Mr. DeMille always pleases --- and the Panther is no exception.  Thank you Nelson for another exciting chapter in the John Corey life!  Keep 'em coming!
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I've lost track of the number of Enigma albums I have in my collection, but I'm glad this one is among them.  Like every other Enigma album, it's like nothing else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and all but it dose not have creative mode or survival mode and they can add some water to the block menu besides<br />that i love it :)
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|When Robert Plant mixes his unique style with a bluegrass twist it's amazing. All of the member of the Band of Joy gave stellar performances. Every time I watch it lifts my spirits.<br />I would recommend it to anyone that loves music and is looking for something refreshing.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I've heard the movie will be disappointing to fans of the book. We'll see. This is a quick, easy read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It probably deserves a 5 star rating but whenever I go to use a save me it crashes and I lose all my progress and then I will have a negative in my gems and have to collect enough gems just to get back on the plus side. Pretty annoying.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Great app for those of us on the go with our iPads,iPhones,etc.  I,m impressed with the ease of being able to print my notes and reminders.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I thought this was another crazy stupid game about slender Man but I was wrong. It is super fun to play. I was just running on top of hill once and I turn around and BAAM SLENDER MAN THEIR!!!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|There's something special about this series. Takes you back to your high school days with an adult perspective. Wish there was a third book!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I heard about the actual story years ago. I was unprepared for how touching a movie this turned out to be.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Simple and easy to use. I use  this app every day.<br />East to change the location. Best of all it does not drain your battery.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What a cliffhanger. Now I can't wait to finish the series. Good book all in all. Reads very fast which I like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic must.play this is a good time pass I like this game more than temple run so add it to your menu and enjoy playing this game!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome because it doesn't freez on me<br />Me and my uncle and my family like the product
B00992CF6W|4.0|When I connect a pit with the ocean it doesn't always fill into the top and will flow for days without ever changing! Please fix the water and I'll turn my review back up to 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is the best game EVER !!!! It's really simple<br />To play and it makes you want to play 24/7 as you are competing<br />against your Facebook friends.<br /><br />I rate this game 10/10
B00992CF6W|5.0|do not get any other mindcraft app olny if it is another app that i rated with a good rate
0345803493|5.0|if you like books like this that are not on a side of dull this is the book for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game you should so down<br />Load it you will have so much fun<br />But be careful it is really addicting
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|will not set the city on my phone no matter how i try and its a Samsung galaxy three. dont buy it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is wonderful. I love it. It is so much easier than temple[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] run and temple run 2.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This is one of the best pieces of literary work I have ever come across. Through a simple story written with much poetic grace, profound issues relating to the meaning of human existence are explored. The significance of the story is not in the plot, which is only a backdrop to the emotional and psychological drama that unfolds as the protagonist finds himself in a situation where he has to confront, in all their stark nakedness, fundamental questions of his humanity, his place in the universe, and the role of faith and religion in his life. \\"Life of Pi\\" poses intellectual challenges to the reader on many levels. It is as much a beautifully written fable as it is a philosophical treatise.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is beyond amazing. If you are a young adult, this is defiantly a great coming of age books. It makes you take a whole new perspective on growing up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is unbelievably amazing and each time I play it,it gets me more pumps up to play each time
B000RZIGVS|1.0|In March 2012, my wife purchased the 49-disc Star Trek:Next Generation set for me from an affiliate on Amazon.com. They arrived in a factory sealed shrink wrap.<br /><br />Since purchase, we have watched approximately half of the episodes on about two dozen disks.  Many of the disks have episodes that are unwatchable, as the content stops, skips, and ultimately freezes. Reloading the DVD into the player does not change this outcome, and the malfunction occurs at the same point in the episodes.  We switched DVD players several months ago, to a good quality Toshiba unit, but the malfunctions still occur, and in the same manner.  We have concluded that the DVDs themselves are defective.  Unfortunately, the reseller is no longer an affiliate.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly, I have searched but cannot find an address to contact Paramount directly about this defective product.  I have also found numerous other customers having the same experience with this set.<br /><br />The episodes that do play are a joy to watch, without commercials and broadcast interruptions.<br /><br />Due to the apparent high risk of defects, I cannot recommend this purchase to others.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American in every way possible. He will be truly missed. Good bless his family. Godbless
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I found this book better than the first one, Grey is even more lovable than in fifty shades.  I enjoyed it very much and couldn't wait to buy the third one...
B008N9AASC|5.0|It is a movie that everyone should see. It shows us how far we have gone to ruin our world. How other peoples have lost their world thru neglate and overpopulation. It shows the poverty and the wealthy living side by side. It shows you the good and the bad. I am sorry that this movie isn't more well-known.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I had no idea LDR was a superstar before listening to this. I'd had this album on my portable music player for a year, based on a recommendation from who I don't even remember, before I played it for the first time.<br /><br />Holy cow.<br /><br />It's been at least a decade since I've heard anything really new and interesting in pop music. I'm not saying I haven't heard any good pop music for a decade, just not anything that made me take notice.<br /><br />At first listening, I thought, wow, every single track is as catchy as The Archies doing Sugar, Sugar. This girl gets melody.<br /><br />On further listenings, I must confess, this is Art, with a capital A.<br /><br />Just because it's Diet Mountain Dew sweet doesn't mean it's not Art.<br /><br />A lot of what this girl has to say is morally problematic (if not abhorrent), but she says it beautifully.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book provides an insightful and provocative look at the lived experience of an adolescent with cancer. It is both humorous and poignant. I am a healthcare provider and am recommending it to all my oncology and pediatric colleagues. It is an excellent read for anyone who wants to understand more about the experience of living with cancer.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|And I had high expectations.  Inspired by my roommate, who has lost weight and kept it off using the Slow Carb Diet, I went all in and bought this book, along with signing up for the concurrent DietBet challenge.  Now, more than ten pounds lighter in two weeks, I'm astonished by how much better I'm sleeping, feeling, et cetera, having learned things that People Just Don't Learn in due time.  I am grateful to have bought this and will get the other books AND read them.  This is also the best present I can think of.  Kudos to Guinea Pig Tim Ferriss for not killing himself and learning how to improve the lives of others.
0762434279|1.0|Wow! It is so hard to write a review for a book this bad.  Anti-intellectual, joke, pretentious, self-absorbed, farce,  ... what else is there to say?  If you are a Tea Party lover who lives in a trailer park; this is your book.  If you have high school degree, you will recognize this piece of trash for the lame manifesto that it is.<br /><br />Here is the essence of the book: \\"Real Estate rental income = good.... Taxes = bad.  Public employees = very bad.  Anyone who earns a salary and has a benefit package is a socialist (i.e. police department, fire department, public school and college teachers) are the bane of all good hearted capitalists.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews.  I don't have the time.  I read books, listen to lectures, absorb ideas and move on.  But this idiot makes Sarah Palin look like an intellectual.  How many times can you repeat the same drivel about the middle class \\"not knowing the difference between an asset and a liability\\"?  There are at least 50 pages of the same repetitive message.<br /><br />I have met a ton of self-made millionaires, and very few of them have the pompous and ridiculous attitude that this moron does.  The moral of the story is: \\"The good man/woman avoids taxes and shelters (hides) his/her income at all costs.  Anyone who works for the government is the root of all evil.  Free the capitalists let them loose and they will heal the world. Amen!\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:1612680305 Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets about Money--That You Don't Learn in School!]]<br />[[ASIN:1612680011 Rich Dad Poor Dad: What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!]]<br />[[ASIN:1612680305 Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets about Money--That You Don't Learn in School!]]<br />[[ASIN:B00AW511AG Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money - That You Don't Learn in School!]]<br />[[ASIN:B008BUHTLE Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money - That the Poor and MiddleClass Do Not!]]<br />[[ASIN:B007L8717Y Rich Dad's Guide to Investing]][[ASIN:160396181X Padre Rico, Padre Pobre (Rich Dad, Poor Dad) (Spanish Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000N90CZG Rich Dad's - 60 Minutes to Getting Rich]]

B0084U0IEG|5.0|In 1972, the great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges published a short story called \\"The Other,\\" in which his elderly self, seated on a bench in Cambridge (the alma mater of Serena Frome, the protagonist of Sweet Tooth), bumps into his younger self. The two versions of Borges engage in a dialogue from which each comes away disconcerted by the differences between them, a device that is used by Borges to reflect on the disparate selves that we inhabit in the course of our lives. McEwan replicates a similar but fleeting moment in the course of his narrative. Toward the end of the book, as Serena is making her way through the crowd at Victoria station, she has a sudden vision: \\"I happened to glance to my right, just as the crowd parted, and I saw something quite absurd. I had a momentary glimpse of my own face, then the gap closed and the vision was gone.\\" Sweet Tooth follows the same logic as Borges, for McEwan, now sixty-four and the author of more than a dozen books, uses this novel to reflect back on his early career.<br /><br />On the surface, the plot seems to belie this strategy. Set in the 1970s, its first-person narrator is a young woman who, after graduating from Cambridge with a degree in mathematics, is recruited by MI5. Although women are usually handed MI5's lowliest tasks, Serena is given a break: she is assigned to an operation called Sweet Tooth, which provides covert funds to authors who have an established anti-communist bias. As such, Serena recruits Tom Haley, a budding young writer with whom she soon begins an affair. In this layer of the story McEwan provides a searching and sometimes hilarious examination of artistic integrity in relation to the state, a subject that resounds in a number of directions: the rise of a neoconservative ideology that has seen cuts to arts funding over the last four decades, the grounding of Sweet Tooth in the real-life precedent of the CIA's funding of the magazine Encounter, and even Haley's choice of Spenser's Faerie Queene as the topic of his doctoral thesis, since Spenser's work is an allegorical epic poem that bears a similarly complicated relationship to the politics of the Elizabethan age. Indeed, one might argue that the Faerie Queene, rather than any spy thriller, is McEwan's biggest clue as to how to read this particular dimension of the novel (although I suspect that Spenser will somehow not see a dramatic spike in sales as a result).<br /><br />Concealed within this story is a recurrent set of in-jokes about McEwan and his early career, expressed through the character of Tom Haley. As part of her background research, for instance, Serena reads Haley's published stories, which bear strong similarities to the style and themes of McEwan's early fiction. Like Borges, McEwan treats his younger self with a mixture of appreciation and amusement, establishing a deliberately ambiguous relationship with those earlier works. On the surface, he asks us to admire them, but underneath he seems to be smirking at their now-apparent youthful enthusiasm. McEwan also gives Haley many of his own biographical features, from his lanky frame to his home university of Sussex. Again, this quasi-portrait is undercut with an Austen-like irony that is easy to miss the first time through, most notably McEwan's repeated insistence on Haley's being a \\"swordsman\\" whose mastery in bed is commented on at every turn by Serena. It is difficult - and therefore deeply humorous - to work out whether McEwan is engaging in sexual boasting by proxy, or whether these moments arise from self-deprecating humor, or whether, like in Austen, the line between the two has become so blurry that it is no longer possible to judge the difference. Either way, careful readers of the novel, especially those who are reading it for a second time, should have wonderful time picking out these shades of ambiguity.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth has wrongly been billed as a spy novel in the vein of, say, John le Carr&eacute;, or even athriller in the mold of McEwan's earlier novel The Innocent, but that is not what this book is about at all. Instead, it asks searching questions about the value of literature to both the educational and political vitality of a society. Serena is a voracious but poor reader: she reads purely for the surface entertainment of a book, for instance, while missing the subtle underlying meanings of the text. As such, she avoids poetry and experimental prose, refusing to grapple with difficult works in what McEwan intimates is a symptom of a larger failure to engage in true critical thinking. Books are in danger, he warns us, of becoming as useless as the defunct telephones in Haley's dystopian novella: \\"Without a telephone system, telephones are worthless junk.\\" Without a critical reading audience, McEwan implies, works of literature, including Sweet Tooth, are \\"worthless junk,\\" toys that are reduced to lowly entertainment when they could be used for so much more.<br /><br />To conclude, if you have never read a book by Ian McEwan, then DO NOT start with this one. The reason is simple: Sweet Tooth is in many ways a literary retrospective, an oblique reflection by the author back on the origins of his career. As such, if you haven't read any early works by McEwan - especially In Between The Sheets - and don't know anything about his life, you will miss a great deal of the logic and rich humor embedded in this novel.ler in the mold of McEwan's earlier novel The Innocent, but that is not what this book is about at all.

B00B780TAK|3.0|I loved Seasons 1 and 2- I watched them over a weekend when I was sick. I found the impact of historical events we're all familiar with fairly fascinating ways to incorporate these characters.  However, it started to get a bit far-fetched and the constant will they won't they got old. Anyway, I couldn't wait to watch Season 3, so I purchased the Season Pass.  First few episodes of Season 3 were great, but then quickly turned into a soap opera and I can't say I enjoyed it nearly as much as previous seasons.  I will call this Season \\"Downton Abbey, 90210.\\"  I can't say I want to watch Season 4.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a gift which my mother-in-law has wanted for a long time.  I am sending this and season 3 to follow up with Season 1 of Downton Abby which I sent her 2 years ago.  She actually asked me for them (and sent me the money) and she NEVER asks for anything so I know this is important to her.  She lives in Ten Sleep, WY out in the middle of no-where.  I cannot review content because I haven't seen except a few episodes of the show, but others who saw the series when it was being shown originally loved it.  That is the best I can do as far as a review.  I will say that Amazon.com makes gift giving a breeze.  It also makes shopping for my husband and myself easy as we live &#34;out in the middle of no-where&#34; in WA state and love to have purchased items shipped for free.

1419705849|5.0|I'll be honest with you: I found the last couple of Wimpy Kids books to be underwhelming, so I wasn't sure what I expected from yet another entry.  Luckily, to my surprise, the gags proved funny consistently throughout the book, making this one of my favorite entries in the series.<br /><br />As with many other books in the series, it takes a while for the actual plot to surface.  But that's fine--the gags that open the book are quite amusing.  And once the plot does surface, it proves to be an interesting one.  Greg wants to go to a dance, but he has to find a date, so he has roped his friend Rowley into helping him.  The drastic measures he's willing to take to get a girl's attention prove quite amusing.<br /><br />One thing that really made this stand out from the other books in the series is that I really felt myself sympathizing with Greg.  Sure, he's no angel, but he isn't as callous as he's been in the previous books.  His amazing strokes of bad luck made me pity him.<br /><br />By the way, one point of caution: if your kids seriously still believe that storks deliver babies, then don't get them this book.  Greg talks about what it was like to be inside his mother's tummy.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, a 23-year-old is writing this review, so the book can be a fun, lighthearted read for adults as well.

B0045HCJ8U|5.0|&#34;A Streetcar Named Desire&#34; will touch anyone who sees it because we all seek love and understand the gradual disintegration of Vivien Leigh as she realizes she will never find it.  Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and Vivien Leigh expertly paint the picture in this New Orleans tragedy.  In her real life, Vivien Leigh was struggling with severe depression at this time, and no doubt this is what makes her acting so desperate and believable.  A real classic you will want to see again and again.
