B004O3ZTZK|5|Firstly, I do not have mature skin, but I really like any foundation product that has sun protection, so I decided to try this.  I have extremely pale skin with pink-ish undertones.<br /><br />Pros:  I really like how smoothly this foundation applies.  Fresh Ivory blends well with my pale skin (though is perhaps just a TAD too dark, so if you're super light be warned).  I would rate it at about medium coverage, as compared to Revlon Colorstay which is more full coverage, but it will definitely even out your tone and cover most blemishes pretty well.  The finish is &#34;dewy&#34; rather than matte, but I think it makes the skin look very natural with proper application.  The SPF 20 is an added benefit.<br /><br />Cons: If you're oily, this foundation is probably not the best for you.  I like a more moisturizing foundation, but if you struggle with keeping shine under control, go for a more matte finish.  This foundation will slide a bit if you don't set it -- I use both translucent setting powder and a setting spray, and with both of those products I don't have any problems.<br /><br />Bottom line, this foundation is great if you have dry skin, and like a fresh-faced dewy finish.  Avoid if you have problems with oil control.
B004CQ710U|5|I have been using dermagen anti-wrinkle patches for quite some time. They keep areas around my eyes from wrinkling at night while I sleep and some lines have actually disappeared. An exceptional product.
B00CBU05DE|5|I'm enjoying my soaps. I love them. Thank you
B000VWSC1Q|5|I liked the product. It works like a blush too. Gostei do produto. Nesta cor, também pode ser usada como blush. Estava com receio, pois nao gostei do batom da Nars, aquele em forma de lápis. Felizmente, o iluminador nao decepcionou. Também gostei do vendedor. Recomendo a ambos.
B000U3GWB8|5|The material and the fit were just right!  Thank you!
B001RPL902|5|It works!  I was skeptical of such a product until recently when someone else had one, then I decided to try one for myself.  It is working for me!
B004W75SLI|3|This product is very good. But I am giving it 3 stars because it is too expensive. It is 24 dollars if you go to macy's website.
B00GBYNBX2|1|This brush was too stiff and the handle broke after a week, not worth the change it cost.
B00CIVWZQG|5|Great quality delivered to your door!!  I didn't have any issues with this product.  The nearest store to me is 50+ miles away to purchase this item and the price is comparable.
B004BIVUHE|5|My favorite mascara for years. Love the dark brown color. It looks much more natural than black. The curved head makes it easier to apply and be precise.
B00BD7EC58|5|I have been warring a wig for over a year since having chemo and the wiggrip is the best  at holding my wig in place.<br />I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B000LNB8HK|5|I used to trim my cat's coat and he has a very thick undercoat and the trimmers would get so hot that it would burn my hands. I bought this and it even cooled the trimmers down.
B004IPLJCG|2|China Glaze is a good quality product, but I'm not thrilled with the color. It isn't at all what I was expecting from the pictures shown. I'll stick to buying it from Sally Beauty.
B00FZKB51S|4|Good for price , soft, easy to wash , minimal shedding and I was my brushes after each use .
B00HZHKTEI|1|This is horrible I recieved this today and I would not suggested spending your money on it
B003QBN7WI|5|I like this color but it's soft and I use it up in a hurry.  Nice to get the pencils at a reasonable price.
B000TD3GK4|5|Thanks!(who's going to find 16 words or more to describe their total<br />happiness with this product?)here ! There's 16,now what?
B000RUHUSI|5|I like this product.   Not made anymore, I don't think, but able to get it on some websites.  Seems still good - not old and gunky!!
B005OHS8TO|1|Unfortunate choice.  turned out I had a severe allergic reation to (probably) the scent in the shampoo.  got a nasty rash on my scalp and hand.  used the product 3 times, 2 weeks later my hands haven't healed.  tried to return but seller said no because I didn't have original packaging and had used.  They didn't tell me it had perfume in it!!really disappointed, and am out almost $30 for 3 uses.
B0030HNNS6|5|I'm in love.  Never going back to another eye liner.  Very inexpensive, but really great; no smudges, and it really lasts.
B0042867VW|5|Even with generic batteries the life is great!  I like it so much I bought a second one for my travel bag.
B007W5RMXO|2|Actually  the  two  that  I  just  received  a  couple  weeks ago are  not  working .  The cartridges  simply  won't  spray  out  the  makeup. Where/  how?  can  I  return  them  for  credit  towards  new  ones?<br />  Melissa  Finifrock  815  761  4727
B002TECJN6|5|Product arrived in a timely fashion. This product was easy to use, just spray on inside of leather footware and then wear for about an hour until it dries. I ordered a pair of boots a half size smaller then my shoe size (that was all that was left!) hoping this stretch would work, and it absolutely did! I put on a thick pair of socks while the spray dried and worked like a charm!
B00IITFQ0Y|2|Was much smaller than I thought needed it for an adult with longer hair
B0000AFUT3|1|I gave it a chance for three weeks and the on/off switch failed.  I have another Remington that is still working and I just wanted another mirror for a second bathroom.  I can't find anything new that compares to the old Remington so I bought another one off E-Bay.  Now I have to figure out how the warranty works.
B00PHMOXH2|5|Nice scent !
B00EG0BKMW|1|Waste of money!! Broke out of the bag. Cheaply assembled
B001R91CPK|3|I'm giving this rating 3 stars, because you do not need a product that has so many chemicals and SOME natural ingredients. I've been using raw cocoa butter and Shea butter and these ingredients I think get rid of scars, etc. for half the cost. I'm not knocking olay, it was a good product, it moisturized my skin and made it not so oily, but if you use a oily product on your skin, especially over night, your skin WILL absorb it. So imagine what your skin is absorbing when using a product with unnatural chemicals...
B009FL7HWE|5|LOVE this product...told many friends about it, and have received  it a few times as gifts
B004O9QU3O|5|Good
B008HODSQO|1|Awful quality, not Remy hair at all.... looks extremely processed, fried, and tapers to scraggly frizzy ends. Do not buy
B001W9QIE0|5|I have used this product before through my hair dresser.<br />It is the best dry shampoo you can get.<br />It leaves hair silky smooth and smelling great.
B0051HJ8BY|5|I'm not a fan of mint. This has a wonderful, clean taste. It doesn't taste medicine-y.  It's hard to find a mouthwash I like without mint flavor, and without a medicine taste.  This is perfect.
B00245MXX6|5|I purchased this argan oil based on the reviews but with slight hesitation.  After using if for 6 months, I am very happy with the purchase!  I found that it did not fulfill all the promises made in the reviews but it came close.<br /><br />A pump or two provided enough coverage for my entire face.  A few more pumps for specific coverage (elbows, feet, hands) provided enough coverage for everything else.  After a week of usage I noticed that red spots on my face disappeared, rough areas (elbows and feet) were smoother and overall, my skin had a much better appearance.  I did use shea butter on my body as well.<br /><br />I did not notice a reduction in a small age spot on my hand but I didn't expect miracles so I'm still pleased with the performance of this product.  My face is a combination of dry and oily and very sensitive and this argan oil did wonders for smoothing out faint crow's feet lines, soothing red spots and brightening my complexion.  Best part?  No irritation no matter where I use it.<br /><br />I can replace my very expensive face lotion with this cheaper and organic product.  Love that!
B0069SQVK0|4|The Germ fighter synergy essential oil blend has been used on small cuts on my arm and legs. The smell is of cinnamon and stings upon application on the cuts but takes away the soreness PDQ.  I have several other essential oils that sit on my bathroom counter for use several times a week.
B00011EXBA|5|Huge bottle and cheap price.Good job Amazon!<br />And about Tend skin, It is a great product but have to use it twice a day to keep the bumps under control but in the end of the day its worth it.
B00HLUQER0|1|I purchased this electric tootbrush and 2 spare brushes in 10/2014. I started having trouble with the brush not charging around the end of 2015. I use it once per day and my cheap electric toothbrush at night before I retire. The toilettree toothbrush does not keep up with the cheaper brand. It is sad to have paid the high cost for the toilettree eledtric toothbrush and it doesn't work. The toilettree toothbrush is so slow and just will not brush my teeth. I have tried everything I can think of to fix it. However, it it senseless to keep trying to get it to run faster. It is truly sad because I was very pleased with the toilettree brand at first. It just doesn't last long. It's just too much money to spend to have something not last long. I believe it is dead and that makes me very disappointed. Would I purchase again or recommend. No, I would not.  Update: I found out the base (the body that you hold in your hand) seems to work okay. Now when I slip on a brush, it dies as soon as I start brushing one tooth, this is when it just completely stops. It's been going on for about 8 months, but it got worse every day that passed. Slower, then even slower, and now it stops on me. So, now I am looking into purchasing another electric toothbrush. I am just undecided as to which one I should get. Arghhhh! There is so many. Darn, I really liked this electric toothbrush. Wished it would have lasted longer.
B001RO1HGE|5|I have been using Mystic Tan products for several years now without complaint. I have found the best results of the build product are to mix it with your favorite moisturization (1/2 and 1/2) for a nice smooth and even skin tone without streaking.
B00165RBM8|5|Purell can be pricy. this is a great deal! I like the aloe more than the regular.<br />I work in a hotel, this is a much needed product for all the people/items we come in contact with.
B000EVIUZC|4|The shampoo worked for the most part and took the bronziness out of my hair. It's just took a little while to see the results and didn't work instantly
B004BD8QEO|5|This is a my second Braun Shaver and it's great. I used a series 5 for about 8 years and it was very good. But, the series is hands down superior.
B00IRYBN02|4|I like that feel like real hair, my only issue was .that it was not the  clip claw on it, but I send a e-mail to the seller and they  are going to refund the money, i will order again.
B00FJEQ9AW|3|too small
B00BFMHG68|5|Fast shipping and the product was as described.
B005XD930M|4|They worked very well for me.  I used them both morning  and night.  They were moist enough that I felt they did a cleaning.
B002EBX3V6|4|I definitely recommend these blades for anyone looking to save money and not compromise quality. Product delivered when promised and blades are exactly what I expected. Thanks!
B000J2A8BK|2|I found solution too watery to be effective for me. Did not color or tame my eyebrows. Packaging was cheap. Sonia Kashuk (Target) makes a much better product at a lower price.
B000NB5AWY|2|I love this soap and used it for years until I read about the antibacterial chemical, triclosan, which is one of the ingredients.  This is an unnecessary addition to the soap and helps contribute to the antibiotic-resistant infections rife in this country.  I keep waiting for Yardley to reformulate its soap, but until they do I'm no longer buying it, and you shouldn't either.
B003YCVWXK|1|Very think brush and dry also.  I use their over the counter black mascara and it is great.  It seems they do not focus on colorful mascaras any more
B002Z72REI|2|I got this scrub because I wanted to try something new and see if something expensive was better. I bought this at Target for $7.99, which is a little bit more expensive than I usually go for, but I thought that it would be worth it. I was wrong. After using this for three months I can honestly say that it hasn't helped at all. It dries out my skin, making my moisturizer not work as much as it has in the past at all. Of course, if I hadn't used anything at my breakouts would have been twice as hideous but if I stuck with my original facial scrub (which was cheaper) I think it would have been A LOT better. I recently broke out during finals week more than a month ago and this would usually take a week to two weeks to clear up completely (even that's long, though), but using this scrub I STILL HAVE THE EXACT SAME BREAKOUT. It's been more than a month and my face hasn't cleared up. I would definitely recommend Neutrogena's Stress Control Power Clear Scrub instead of this. Although, I'd probably recommend getting this in stores than online since it's only $5.99 at Target.
B00G9BTFPA|5|Great gift
B00VNXQE94|5|I LOVE THIS SERUM.<br />I don't know how I got so lucky to be a &#34;tester&#34; for Radha products, but they are all great.<br />I use this one by itself before bed and under their Retinol Moisturizer during the day.<br />My skin has never looked better!
B000A87L4A|5|I started using this in the mid-1990s (I was a total Borghese shopper at that point).  While I have diverged into other brands of skincare and makeup, this is the one must-get in my arsenal.  Do you ever use a cotton pad to remove eye makeup and end up with little strings of cotton in your eye?  Yuck.  With this you don't need cotton, so you won't have that problem.    I've been testing new foundations and many of them are water-resistant.  Cream \\"makeup removers\\" from Shiseido and Dior do not do a thing to remove them, but Gel Delicato does!  I wish it weren't so hard to find.  Even Borghese is sold out.  I might order a kit from somewhere just to get the eye makeup remover.  Even Borghese is out of stock.
B00016XJ4M|4|I love this toner I can see a big difference in my skin. I would recommend this!
B003WOSASK|5|Good
B002QEUO40|3|No where near as good as original KMS Silker Shampoo. Also, smaller size for price. I was disappointed. Great smell though, and did get the overall job done.
B00BFCH5MS|5|Love it!
B001QYBURQ|5|This oil makes my hair really shiney and smell very nice. You only need a tiny bit on wet hair and comb thru, then style as usual. I have color treated hair and it conditions it beautifully. I only use it about once a week, that's all you need!
B009EE9JFK|5|So glad I found this..it works well
B001FWXTMS|5|Not sure why stores no longer carry these, but I think they are great!  My kids prefer these to all the others we have tried, so now I buy in bulk.
B0015A30XI|5|I love this shampoo - it smells great and leaves my hair feeling so clean and full of body.  It's all natural and is made in the USA!  (specifically in Ohio)
B0006IJ7A0|4|One or two swipes and you're done.  It really is a great product.  As all eye makeup removers, avoid your eyes.  I got some in my eyes and they felt sort of greasy.
B00GYF65TK|4|Great for the price....
B00HMCTRJ4|5|Nice! The best lint free wipes I've ever used. Highly recommended.
B00312D6PU|1|You get what you pay for...<br />I have had this chair less than a year in my salon, and all three of my stylists chairs are bending at the base.  The bolts holding the base together are stripped at the bottom and it's like the metal is so cheap that it's sinking in and slanting.  Wouldn't waste your money on something that doesn't last even a year.
B00O7A55MC|5|I have been using this serum for over a month and I love it! It is all natural and appears to fade my trouble areas (dark spots), I will definitively keep on using and re-order.
B000UZEQJQ|4|Of course, it is not as firm and strong as the original one, but it is acceptable, I used it, and it works just fine.
B00ALKHY9O|5|Works great!  Better than the battery operated type by far!  Makes my Quattro blades last and last and last and last...
B00DUDJX6Q|5|Love Philosophy Fragrances.  Must order variety in order to get my favorite fragrance (Baby Grace)
B000KOQ8A2|5|I had terrible problem with several ingrown toenails over the years.  My nail tech suggested I try this product and now whenever I start to have an ingrown toenail, I start applying this to the whole cuticle around the nail AM and PM until the problem is relieved.  Sometimes I do have to cut the edge of the nail, but at least the skin is softened around it so I can do it without much problem.  Often the product takes care of it on its own.  I will not be without this product.
B00BEWGTGW|5|They fit
B00FNO512K|3|In my opinion, the price is a little steap , given the size of the products. I thought they would be slightly larger sizes since they looked bigger in the picture. Once I received this in the mail I looked back at the listing and noticed it did say sample sizes instead of travel / trial. That was my fault , but still a little overpriced.
B000VON7SC|5|really love this scent.  Had to put it in refrigerator cause when UPS delivered it was sooo hot I couldn't even put it on.  But in spite of that fact the aroma was still there and did not hurt it.  Will order more as soon as I run out.  Fast delivery. Great Product.  Thank you
B00DXM3LAI|5|excellent nail file
B004VDP37W|5|Excellent product
B00RT272R6|5|Great machine, works easy and great! Saw the improvements on my face after first usage. Definitely recommend. The only thing mine came with one handle missing.
B004WZ4A7S|1|Wow- can't believe I spent $28 on one short sleeve scrub top! I read the description of 2 pkt as meaning two pack not 2 pockets - what a waste of money :(
B00008BFXL|5|It was just what I needed. No complaints. It was cheaper than what I would have purchased in the stores, and it came in a timely manner.
B007L86026|1|This has to be the worst polish i have seen the seller was great i would recommend but the polish is Aweful  so toxic the smell made my daughter sick and didnt look anything like photo i cant recommend this to anyone!
B00846O4ZE|5|I have finally found my dream shampoo! I have very thick hair and it can get reallllly greasy...to the point that before my hair would even dry after a shower it would already look greasy. I've tried SO MANY different shampoo/conditioners (expensive ones!) with no improvement. After using this shampoo for the first time, my hair completely transformed! It is super soft, smells great, and is not greasy whatsoever! I can shampoo every other day now without getting greasy hair. This shampoo does wonders and will not disappoint. My hair has never felt so soft, I cannot stop touching it!<br /><br />Also this is the first time I've been compelled to write a product review, so that says a lot :)
B006GQYSGO|5|I moved from an expensive Braun razor with an even more expensive cleaning system. This razor cleans with a warm water rinse and gives a close, comfortabl shave. It requires an overnight charge every two weeks.
B003CJ6S20|5|I really like the way it feels in my skin, odor is really clean and neutral, it can be used both by men and women. It leaved the skin clean and really soft, you don't need to pour a large amount of this product in your hand/towel or whatever, it is really good. I will buy it again.
B007YQUSHS|5|The color after you apply looks exactly like the color of the picture on the box!<br />I put my nails side by side with the picture and it's the same.<br />The effect of the color is the same too (the \\"star\\" or \\"glitter\\" effect), I LOVE dark nails (black, brown...), and the color is really nice, unless you don't like dark nails. So be sure that you get what you see on the picture.<br />Also, it is clear on the box that it has to be used with the light (I already had the light that came with the starter kit of Sensationail).<br />As an addition, although it's not directly related to this product: I bite my nails so I couldn't wait for them to grow, so I bought nail tips (similar to fake nails, but it's glued only to the tip of the nails, which I thought would be healthier...).<br />I applied the plastic tips and then proceeded to the steps of Sensationail, and it worked really well.<br />The polish was able to cover the slight bump that the nail tips created and the result is seamless. I had to apply a thick layer of the polish each time for this to happen, and I was afraid it wouldn't dry but it did, and got hard as the acrylic product promises.<br />I'm happy with the product, the results and the color!
B00CXUHP6W|1|Received product. It was not the product in this photo. It arrived in a clear plastic bag.The product had flat edges where the spatula (pink part) was suppose to be angled (to scrape edges of bottles). The spatula was almost as thick as it was wide. It did not scoop the product out of the bottle. The spatula was very hard and was not flexible at all.<br />The Spatty Pair that I received later as a gift (not from amazon) did come with the pink cardboard and plastic packaging and the product was completely different.
B00L2J4ZP4|5|quick delivery and Quality
B00156C2EU|5|These are a great help for persons who can't handle dental floss!
B001G5HZCY|5|I started using a double edge razor about six weeks ago after tiring of the cost of Gilette Fusion blades.  Have tried Lord, Merkur and Derby blades.  Just tried my first Feather blade, and it is FAR superior to the others.  It shaves extremely close and is not too sharp if little or no pressure is applied while shaving.  In combination with Proraso cream this is the best double edge shave you can get.  I actually look forward to shaving in the morning.  What used to be a dull routine is now almost fun.
B007N47C66|5|I would highly recommend this Electric Callus Remover to anyone whose feet are really, really rough.  Nothing else would work on my husband's feet; he has very callused heals and all over rough feet.  This is the ONLY Callus Remover that has even begun to remove the dead skin; we LOVE this and will never use anything else.  It is well worth the little extra money that it costs; so glad we ordered it...Happy Customer!!  Thank you so much for inventing something that actually works!!!
B0085RZLQS|5|Exactly what I was needing. I've purchased off brand replacements that didn't fit. Some things are just worth paying more for.
B000GBMYC0|5|Sooner or later you'll need one of these if you have the Braun razor.  And it DOES make a difference in shaving comfort.  The manufacturer recommends changing the head every 18 months.  My razor got dropped & didn't seem to shave me as well.  A change of the head and it worked just fine.
B0018A32XS|2|It rips skin and doesn't shave well in or out of the shower I went back to regular razors they worked better and less often.
B00GOD56TC|5|K
B0000532PW|4|worked really well the first week and after that felt like it got a tolerance to it. had this bump a long time because i picked it since i thought it was a pimple
B0083CTBUM|5|Good little sharpener for all those eye pencils!
B0091OCC48|2|The color is too much for me.
B00E8UL80O|5|These are my go-to lashes! The perfect wispy lashes with volume and length that doesn't feel heavy.
B006UEUK82|3|I didn't care very much for the applicator tip otherwise the lip stain was fine. That flat tip just bothered me.
B00385WMJ6|4|was 0k....... I do wish the plastic was thicker but it is holding up ok so far
B000ODNSR0|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and all the Aveeno products I use!  This body wash is lovely, smells lovely and truly leaves your skin soft, smooth and NOT dry at all!  Prior to this I was using Dove soap, which I love, but having finally tried body wash I am stuck with Aveeno.  I was always leary to body washes (not sure why) but loving Aveeno so much I tried the body wash and it is great.  I also use this as my shaving cream!
B003VMU63K|5|I love bright and vibrant colors and this is it, I get compliments from my customers all day on my nails
B00375BUQ8|5|nice weight to it---fit and finish first class---handle is not slippery at all---easy to adjust, change blade and clean---assembly and disassembly easy and safe---adjusted position is positive, no creeping out of position---very satisfied and would buy again---tried a few positions and settled on 1 1/2, 1 3/4---use other razor for close lip and trim work
B00LBIOSCQ|1|Would give zero stars if I could. This is the worst hair ever.  Sheds worse than dog hair.. Tangles and mats. I've had it installed for 7 wks with little heat applied,  wash and conditions every week,  sleep with silk bonnet,  and still it looks like I have a bird's nest on my head 😠
B0000532XX|1|I was excited upon ordering this item, as I love the line of products, but, without first testing this on myself before purchasing, I wasn't able to know ahead of time that the fragrance would be too perfume-y/overpowering.  I am not able to use the item.
B0019JF0OW|5|Product came in good working order and we were pleased with the timeliness of the shipment. Thank you!
B0094J6SU4|5|Love!
B002ZNJIAI|5|Seller ships faster and product is true and on point.
B00LLMB3W0|5|This product is awesome. I have almost no lashes its so weird but this along with my regular mascara works awesome! I have never looked like I had that many eyelashes ^_^<br />I thought I would get it all over my face since Im very clumsy but its very precise and easy to apply
B002NVFRNY|4|THESE WORK GREAT FOR FAST TOUCH UP. DON'T EXPECT THESE TO TOTALLY WHITEN TEETH, ITS FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY DO WHITEN AND JUST NEED A FAST FIX. ALWAYS USE THESE PRIOR TO PARTIES. THE TASTE IS NOT BAD, AND DOES MAKE TEETH SENSITIVE.
B001ET7BPS|5|This stuff is fantastic. Its on the heavy side so you don't have to use much for it to leave your skin feeling moisturized. It also smells really good, and it has improved the look of my skin by a lot.
B00LYLJJO2|5|A quality product. They will last a lifetime
B000VEN3RW|5|It is a good idea to have one of these around if you do at-home chemical peels.  This will stop the chemicals in the peel from continuing to work after you wash off the peel. It's a great safety precaution to keep from burning your skin!  The price is  fair.  The service and timing were quite good.  I also purchased the 35% Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel Serum. It was very effective.  These are the only two products I have purchased from Cellbone so far, and I must say I am pretty impressed!
B004FKNYWW|5|good
B001A43ELC|5|Worked very well! Not messy as long as you heat it properly. Have baby oil on hand to remove any left over wax.
B000MQR1NG|5|This is my new favorite for mature, somewhat dry, thin skin. It provides great matte coverage with a light weight and a variety of application methods possible (spray directly, spray finger, or spray applicator sponge). Covers pores beautifully with absolutely no cakeyness. Colors are a bit darker than I expected, but once you find the right one, this is amazing foundation. I'm not sure how long it will last (the bottle feels somewhat light but it doesn't take much).
B00IYMKSGW|5|Great stuff!  Most oil-type treatments are too heavy for my hair, which resulted in me using them overnight (like a mask) and then washing out in the morning.  This product is lightweight enough that I can use it in the morning on towel-dried hair and style as usual.
B004IBVW86|5|Simply amazing shadow base! Doesn't crease, shadows stay in place at least 8-10 hours.<br />And for the price, you just can't wish more!
B00DSSZS1W|5|Fast delivery and satisfied with product.
B004BCT9AK|2|When you first put it on, the color pay-off is pretty impressive. It glides on easily, and yes, the color is pleasingly intensely black, like a gel liner.<br /><br />Too bad it doesn't stay that way. This eyeliner pretty much starts melting from from your eyes the minute you put it on. After about a minute, I noticed that it was already starting to fade, and about half an hour later it was already smudged out and patchy. I decided to take it off, and I found I could easily wipe it off with my hands. I put some eye primer on to see if it would make it stick better, but even with primer it fades into a soft, smudgy black within a few minutes.
B00H2QJ1Z0|4|I have been looking for a great affordable brush set for a while now. I tried some of the higher end names, and I have been let down!!!!!! This set is awesome. It contains synthetic as well as natural brush hairs. The brushes are very soft and made of great materials. I love the details of what each brush is used for engraved on each handle and they also have a numbering system. The leather case they come in does have a strong smell but does air out. I washed the brushes in mild baby shampoo before I used them and for the most part I did not have a lot of shedding. I did see minimal shedding out of the natural hair brushes which is expected, but absolutely none from the synthetic. I absolutely recommend this product to everyday makeup wearers or an MUA like myself.
B003TDXVBA|5|This is not a bad tooth brush by any means though.  I recently purchased a new toothpaste as well off Amazon, a Colgate Optic White pack of 2.  It is very nice, first toothpaste I have ever used that I actually feel refreshed after using.  Priceless.
B000URWZ60|4|Had a great deal of stress when I first put it on and my entire face turned red!  But after a few minutes you get used to the refreshing tingly feeling...wash off after 15 minutes and it is a new you!  I was fortunate to get this at Marshalls for $4!!! Yes, four bucks!!!  So I bought two of them!!!
B009QSITKA|5|I have been using this make-up for years after trying other compact foundations, including some very expensive ones (eg Lancome, Estee Lauder).  The New Complexion compact foundation is the best, with great coverage and long wear.  Love it!!
B00008BFXL|4|I bought the brush head to replace the old one. I've used Sonicare series for 4 years. It's a revolutional product. The way it operates help to clean up the tooth, but also keeps the right way to brush. With traditional toothbrush, I always did it too heavily so that my tooth suffered. With this, I don't have any problem now!
B00383K2R2|2|I bought this for some sun damage on my arms.  It was moisturizing, but after several weeks of use, I saw no lightening of the dark spots.
B002RBF1PO|5|This is a nice razor, especially for those just starting out with DE shaving. Its lighter and less aggressive than my Merkur Futur but gives an excellent close shave for me with Derby blades. Nicely chromed. Forget those cartridge razors, learn to properly use a DE and you will never regret it.
B00CLPV3M6|4|Lime scent somewhat over powering.
B00AXTUPQM|3|it is OK
B005KVQAUS|5|great product.  good seller
B001CKBZBU|3|these are ok, came quickly, my only complaint is that some of the cups are kinda dirty
B000P22TIY|5|Love it, long lasting and smells great.
B00NTB6CPE|5|I love this hairbrush!  I am ordering this for gifts for friends who have girls with long hair.  I use it on my and my daughter.  I have been using all natural shampoo and conditioner.  With those products, it gives your hair moisture but they don't detangle.  Using a regular brush it painful and takes a lot of time to gently get the knots out.  This brush goes right through the hair like nothing.  The best part is I don't have to spend extra money on buying a separate detangling product.  Works better than expected.
B003CTTZQQ|4|Looking for results that my edges is growing by using this product, so far it is not working but it has only been three weeks.
B001FYZLPE|5|I used this MOST RECENTLY from June 2011-October 2011 as my nightly shower soap. I'm ordering it again because...I'm breaking out like crazy. I've lived in really humid, tropical areas (Florida, Hawaii, and New Orleans) and really dry areas (Flagstaff, AZ). This stuff works in all climates, killing off the crap without stripping your skin. In the interim, I've been using 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and not only are my bed linens and night clothes bleached out--my skin is dried out and breaking out. So, I'm back to Defense Soap. Buy it because you won't be disappointed. By the way, a little goes a LONG WAY. Unlike GymSoap, it is TRICLOSAN-FREE!
B00DLRNSSK|5|This is one of the best creams my wife has used after her pregnancy! After our second child, she had some few stretch marks that were noticeable, I decided to look around for a product that would aid her. I came across this product and decided to give it a shot. What do you know? After a few applications of this product, my wife and I started to see results. We both saw less and less of the stretch marks and from that experience, I can say that I'm a satisfied customer. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a treatment for stress marks or scars.<br />Quality product, I may purchase this product again if I decide to have another child.
B00937FJO8|5|Improve the dry and tired eyes and the price is cheap. But if you want to reduce the dark circle and wrinkle. You should buy an advanced one.
B000ZLQJHC|5|No clue why this works but it takes care of many odd skin ailments. Plus..made in Ireland.
B001A3HPT0|5|Seriously, this stuff smells amazing. I keep finding myself sniffing this shave soap every time I goto the bathroom because the smell is so addicting. Not only does it smell great, but it leaves your skin moist and clean.Try the oldschool shaving way, its awesome.
B004MM0OK8|5|Works great!  I use it to hide my full sleeve on my left arm. Perfect.
B000P277J0|5|I found this perfume because I love Very Irresistible. I tried it on in the department store and wore it for the rest of the day. I kept catching whiffs of it and became entranced by it. I wear VI in the summertime and Amarige Mariage is perfect for autumn and into the winter.
B006YQ41VI|5|I did not get the greasy results others mention. I found that I do need to use enough to adequately cleanse my hair and scalp, or you can wash, rinse, repeat. It doesn't have sulfates, so it's not going to lather like other shampoos, but sulfates are what I'm trying to avoid! My hair feels soft and is clean and shiny every time I use it! I like the conditioner, too. I will definitely buy again.
B0011Z3X8O|5|I have only been using this for a week but I can see a change already. I have horrible acne on my face, neck and chest. I can already see a huge change on my chest which includes less acne/breakouts and clearer skin. I know my face will take more time but I can already notice a difference of it being less oily during the day and less major breakouts. I hope it keeps getting better. It does seem like a strong concentration because there are a few dry patches.  Word to the wise, when using benzoyl peroxide products you need to switch to white towels or else you will inevitably bleach everything you own!
B00FRZ1DS6|5|Love it! There magic in this bottle! My scars have all but disappeared. My skin is even tone and tighter. I use it every night and wake up with soft, supple looking skin. The lines on my forehead have filled in too. Amazing product!
B00A9ELDS0|5|I love this!  I get really bad black heads and milia clogged pores on on my jaw line, on my neck and chin. The first 2 weeks made my face look like a zit bomb went off. Worst acne since highschool! I was very disappointed , and at first i thought I would send it back, but then decided I'd gave it one more week with the same results.  The 3rd week my skin started clearing up and I've notice less milia and black heads on my jaw line (where they were the most noticeable)
B004D7I7CO|4|I was recommended this mask at a spa, and it's way cheaper here. Took a while to come, but it was worth the wait. I use it once or twice a week. It brightens my complexion, making my skin baby soft. Great for sensitive skin too. I actually used it while on Accutane. I especially love it during summer as it's refreshing.
B0018DAUDK|1|really is the worst perfume that I bought, acquired with the idea of ​​giving it away and do not dare because I embarrassed a fragrance that does not last anything or 5 min. I lost my money and not recommended
B004D2C57M|5|I had never used any of their products. But Olay, Mary Kay, Clinique were not wowing me. I decided with this purchase I would do half my face the old way and half with these new products to see if I could tell a difference. I can. I am starting to see those fewer fine lines that everyone promises. I added the crazy Monistat Powder Chafing Gel as primer - also had never used a primer - and I am very happy.
B00BB0B1II|5|Works well and arrived on time
B004OHQR1Q|5|I loved them! I got them pretty cheap, I Thought they were going to feel cheap, but they don't! (:
B00376IQT6|4|This product appears to be diminishing my dark circles, but the jury is still out.
B00NRB17RE|5|Excellent product.
B00BB103XQ|4|After watching TiffanyD videos and reviews about this shadow base I decided to purchase it, it's good, it does the job without creasing.
B0002JBPEY|5|I used to think that Chanel was kind of an old woman perfume until my husband bought me a bottle of this, it is so light, feminine and grown up while still staying young.  One spary stays on all day and as many of the other reviews say, you can smell it on your clothes when you undress at the end of the day.  It's classy and elegant.  I have a whole new perspective on all Chanel perfumes, they are timeless.
B0036YMVEU|3|I have am a blonde and have very light lashes and ordered the 28 day brown mascara in hopes that I could get away with going w/o mascara and still appear to have eyelashes.  I think that next time I will order the black as the brown did not make my lashes quite dark enough.  The color is still working several weeks after applying, but I do not feel that I can go without regular mascara.  At least you can see I have eyelashes now.  The fumes from the solution really made my eyes sting and water even though it never got into my eye, but if I took my time this was not a big problem.
B004UQ6Q62|4|made ni china
B00J36HV8G|4|Good assortment of colors, mostly contains neutral colors. However, the texture isn't my favorite. I like the feel of scunci's effortless thermal twisters more.
B00ESVYONG|5|I just used this C-Clamp holder to work on 12 wigs. It did slip a bit but not much and not often.  I was steaming and running a comb through the hair. Sometimes I'd hit a tangle which would pull on the Styrofoam head and thus the clamp. Hitting enough of them would eventually cause the clamp to move a bit but I was using it on a highly polyurethaned table, too.  Out of 12 wigs I only had to re-tighten it three times. It worked beautifully for me and is the best investment I made to help me work with my wigs.
B008FQGL1S|5|very natural look and feel to it... prefer it in dark colors because sometimes tracks are exposed in front hairline. other than that.. its my style of choice!
B005NZ6790|5|excellent
B006W2SYF8|1|I ordered this product for my son who can't be with us for Christmas, and was so sad when he told me that the charging stand is not the correct one for this razor and will not work with it.  He is planning to send it back for a refund because he is afraid if he exchanged it, the new one would have the same issue.  How can this happen?  I am so very disappointed!
B005GADQN2|5|If I purchase these at my local beauty supply store, 100 would cost over $20 so this is a great price. I am a makeup and licensed esthetician and I use these very frequently so a good deal is vital.
B00CJIOG0Q|5|This is a great stamper.  I love that it's soft, so I don't have to rock the stamper; just press it on my nail and it's so easy to straight stamp, which I couldn't do with my Konad stampers. I did have to lightly file off the shiny film with a (probably) 220 grit nail file; a very soft nail file; it doesn't take much.  This is definitely a keeper and well worth the wait.  No problem with the foam popping out and the plastic little scraper works great; don't like to use metal as they scratch my plates.  So nice to finally stamp my designs straight, it was driving me nuts!  An addition 10/1/2014 I did notice that it doesn't work with some nail polish (I used a cheapie) it wouldn't pick up the image; so I used my Konad stamper and it picked up the desing; could be the depth of the etching as well.
B000VV1ZMU|5|At long last a way to confidently put on my brows and keep them on without fear of brushing them away or smearing them all day. Wow.  Works great on  unruly brows as well, let my sister try it for that reason and she loves it.  Ordered her a bottle and another formself.  Great product.
B0069SQZ5G|5|Best, most potent, highest grade clove oil I've used.
B001VEK1C6|5|I come from a family that is, to say the least, beard enabled. I have very coarse facial hair, and as a result, always nick, cut, and wear out my razors faster than most (for the person thinking you have coarser hair, you're wrong, so there, I win). I have been using a Mach 3, which does really get a lot of those coarse hairs, but ends up running me into a hole with replacement blade costs. The razors also gets pretty dull after a few weeks use. I also get ingrown hairs from cheap dollar store blades (which, don't lie, a lot of you out there have tried.) So here's my review of this Braun Series 3-370cc electric shaver.    It's nice. It does exactly what i expected it to do for the cost. I found it at walmart, on rollback, for $1[...] bucks. It has a 60 day return value (keep your receipt and box and anything else) so if you don't like it, return it. Norelco only has a 45 day return period. Anyway, make the small investment and try an electric shaver( If you do the math, even if you only have this razor for a year, it's only $[...] a month.) Unabashedly, my girlfriend said that my face felt like a baby's ass as she caressed my gentle features once hidden underneath a bushel of thorny beard. I like keeping my girl happy (no i'm not whipped, I just know little things make a big difference :)    It's easy to charge too - Just plug it in, the LED flashes blue and looks cool (it makes your bathroom look cooler too with the dark blue glow it presents... Like tron....)     I've done multiple shaves since and will never, ever go back to a regular razor (unless I forget this for some foolish reason, or because I'm hyperactive.)     I haven't tried the norelco, but the new one looks cool. It didn't get many reviews, and the ones it did weren't very good compared to the cheaper models which should essentially do the same thing, so i went with this one.    The cleaning system (port, whatever) is a little loud when it's cleaning, so make sure you do it when music is on and when no one is sleeping unless you want to annoy them. It is kinda annoying to sensitive ears,making a higher pitched (neeeerrragghhhh) sound, but hey, its nice to have that cool fresh scent on a razor every time you use it.    The replacement blades, I might also add, are significantly cheaper than norelco for the long term investment.    So, 5 stars, it could be 4, but whatever, I like it. Again, at least here in upperstate new york area, the walmart had it for $[...] bucks.
B00GBI590Q|5|I'm 42; my skin has minor dryness and wrinkles. Most of my life I have been struggling with combination, VERY sensitive, red, acne prone skin.<br /><br />I'm back for another bottle. The jar has lasted me 3.5 months. The seller shows you how to use it as a serum and also as a quick 5 minute skin refresher mask underneath some paper towels dipped in aloe vera (try this! I love the results). I have also used this serum as a base ingredient for 3 batches of extremely potent Vitamin C serum that I used to purchase for $60 - $80 per bottle at an upscale spa. The versatility of the product makes the price very reasonable - it's saved me money since another $13 for L-ascorbic acid will give me 10-20 bottles of the freshest Vitamin C serum possible.<br /><br />I dreaded coming looking in the mirror and slathering on make up to cover up the pimples and redness. Addressing wrinkles and acne used to make my skin a mess, it became very red and dry! I tried Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Clean and Clear, Clearasil, Oil of Olay, each irritated my skin. I tried Estee lauder, Chanel and Clinique products as well and even they caused redness and bumps.<br /><br />My friend gave me this serum recommendation after I complimented her on her clear, soft, glowing skin.<br /><br />The ingredients have been so good for my skin! Not only is my skin more clear, I LOVE how this serum makes my skin feel balanced and fresh. The dry skin and spots are gone, and I am hydrated but not greasy.<br /><br />ON days when I skip this step under my moisturizer, I notice that pimples crop back up, my face is oiler in spots but drier in others.<br /><br />TIPS:<br /><br />1. Adding a good exfoliator has also made the difference for my acne and wrinkles. Cure is the #1 selling exfoliator in Japan. It is made up with 91% of hydrogen water, and water probably is only thing which was suitable for my skin. It makes a WONDERFUL quick at home, no recovery peel for yucky dead skin.<br />2. I use this with retinol at night, salicylic acid wash, and a good anti-wrinkle serum with SPF. I notice the antioxidants hyaluronic acid takes the redness and flaking away without breaking me out. It doesn't clog pores and I notice my other anti-aging products work better with this layered underneath.<br /><br />This serum also nourishes for healthier skin, my skin feels like it's more resilient and hydrated since I've started using it. I love using it as a mask like I said above.  There is a reason that hyaluronic acid serum is sold every 40 seconds in Japan.<br /><br />Having unhealthy, blemished, scarred skin really sapped my confidence for most of my life. I'm starting to recover from that daily embarrassment. It feels good to know that your skin looks good, and I don't have to worry how it looks.<br /><br />Bottom line: Highly recommend this seller, this serum and I am going to go thank the girl friend who helped me find this product.<br /><br />(from my wife, not me; all typos are MY fault)
B009GEUPAG|5|I've been using Oil of Olay for 30 some years. I am 60 and nobody believes it. I love Oil of Olay products. The 7in One moisturizer is awesome. It feels so soft and no greasy feel at all. It absorbs into my skin instead of sitting on top. I use it every day.
B001EWET8W|5|Like the shampoo, this is a good hydrating conditioner that does well with curly hair. It smells nice and clean.
B0071HIE94|4|The shampoo works fine but the squeeze bottle is hard to use -it exits sideways so it makes it hard to get to.
B000FSNF2C|5|Just what I wanted...Yeah!  No longer does my color bleach out!  IUt's economical to get the larger size.  Great buy!
B00FQPAWXY|3|My wife had used sleep masks made of unknown synthetic material before becoming allergic.  Searching for a hypoallergenic sleep mask, this is what I found.  At $15, it is the most expensive we have bought.  The $5 shipping is not cheap, either, but she needed it as soon as possible & it arrived in 3 days.  The strap is not adjustable, unlike her cheaper mask.  If it does not cause contact dermatitis, the cost will have been worth it.
B00006IV22|5|Light weight.  Easy to use. Easy to pack.
B003KWO3UI|5|I've used this manual razor for years and it's about as well-designed as it could be.  Never had the slightest problem with it and I like how I can just push a button to eject an old cartridge and slide/snap right into a new blade.  I also like the blade storage under the razor cradle.  I bought an extra one to leave in my travel kit,  just wrapped in a washcloth.  I already reviewed the actual blade cartridge itself, so this is about the handle (5-stars for both), but if U R wondering about the blades, THEY'RE GREAT !!!
B00AYZOFS4|5|Very matte look, but that's what I love about it. I prefer to apply this cream with a makeup brush. It covers red spots and lasts all day long, plus does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. The color is a little light, so plan to add bronzer and/or blush to add contouring.
B00PD9M6VE|4|like the product and the way it leaves my hair feeling.
B00VZONRHI|3|I'm a older person and my skin isn't as tight as when I was younger.  It appears Nono works best on tight skin.  Also, I find that you have to push down really hard to keep it activated, which is a bit painful.  Not sure this product is working for me.  I will try for the 60 days and see if I get the hang of it.  If not, I'm going to return it.
B000XE2IMQ|5|I was so disappointed when I'd learned that this fragrance was discontinued. So I became a little apprehensive about ordering but was pleasantly surprised!! It is by far my favorite fragrance!!
B00DQY7JJ2|4|This cleanser was used at a place where I had a facial. I was happy to find it online for a few dollars less. Good product that cleanses the face and substantially reduces acne.
B0062GZJOS|1|Really bad! I have used many liquid liners, this is one of the worst! Hardly comes out, not consistent! Waste!
B00G0O3B4W|5|I saw the making of these soaps on &#34;Hows it Made&#34; on a whim I went on Amazon and low and behold there it was. Ordered one it was not expensive or at least as expensive as had anticipated. When it arrived my daughter and I couldn't believe how beautiful and fragrant it was. It sits in our bathroom because its much to beautiful to use. :-) we will buy more. LOVE IT
B0011TWVWE|5|This is the best remedy for sore gums, canker sores, or other oral afflictions. Heals overnight! I order always 2 at a time when I run out.
B003CYKDDA|1|What i ordered isn't what they sent.I did not want the NEW oil free moisturizer. Do not like it and now i have to send it back.It isn't expensive but isn't what i ordered!
B00BJ93PT4|5|Excellent quality shea butter.
B00J86HFB4|5|These rollers worked very well with the Emjoi device.  I also bought the green ones that seem to be coarser than these.  The shipping was quick.
B000WKWA6K|5|This product works.I've finally found something that works.my nails are soft weak brittle.use this as recommended and you will have hard nails.I also use the nail cream with it.
B00006JT6O|4|I love how this cream softens and hydrates my skin.  I have used it several years.  Wish it did more to fade age spots.
B001AJ6YS2|4|I'm a shaving cream and razor kind of guy and I am not picky about razors.  I actually like using cheap disposable razors that are 'worn' because I have sensitive skin.  I saw this for a really good price at amazon so I brought it to see if this better than a razor and I have to say that it is very good.  This Philips shaver kind of irritates my skin but for the shave, it is not bad if you are in a hurry.  Although this is probably not a big problem since all new razors and shavers irritates your skin.    The thing that irritates me about this shaver is its packaging and certainly not one of those 'frustration free' packaging.  Rather it takes me about 5 minutes to open the box and hack into the blister packaging before I could take the shaver out.  Other than that, I might use this from now on.
B004YL64RE|5|These clothes remove make-up easily and they are gentle on my skin. Also, they are a great value compared to other brands.
B00ASHRF8K|5|It is what I expected.  I have not detected any smell mentioned by some others.  Nice color.  I wish the teeth section was a bit larger, and a larger handle would also suit me, but I knew this before I ordered it..
B000GCSD60|5|I could smell the fragrance as I opened the package. Perfect! Will order my other favorite fragrances from here when available.
B0009OAI8Q|5|Bought as a birthday present for my wife. So good her sister stole the last one I bought her and I like the smell of it really nice.  Sophisticated Adult smell not something a young school girl would wear.  Certainly makes people notice you are wearing perfume
B001GXF35M|5|I suffer from major stigmatisms in both eyes, and even though I have 20/20 vision, my muscles often are slow to react due to eye strain of working behind a screen 40-50 hours a week.  This product isn't made to turn your eyes blue, it is specifically designed to aid with EYE STRAIN.. you know the kind that gives you Migraine headaches? The kind that makes you want to cry but it would hurt too much?  I have been using the product over a month now and my eyes are not as \\"tired\\" or \\"painful\\" or \\"dry\\" or \\"itchy\\" as before. I have used other temporary aids over the counter, but am very impressed with the longevity of the effects of this product.  It really does \\"Rest the Weary Eye\\".  Innoxa French Blue Eye Drops Gouttes Bleues 10ml
B00387F42Q|5|I'll definitely purchase this again and again and again....it works well, it's not greasy & it arrived in good time.
B003RF82UK|5|it doesn't feel oily and nasty on your face and I like the smell of it, fresh. I've only used it for a few weeks and so far I like it
B004J31KOO|5|Best brow pencil! Goes with almost every eyebrow color
B000KFX10Q|5|Great scent and feels like silk on my skin, this is my new favorite moisturizer/lotion. Will buy again.
B000TAE0RK|2|For those that do not like scented soaps this will not be for you. It is very strongly scented. Also, it's very dark such that it can \\"dirty\\" your shower or bath. We weren't able to use the soap because of the smell so i do not know how well it would work.
B005GD1EP6|5|nice to pack with us and just what we needed
B002GKT2ZQ|5|Little about me:  I'm a product junkie and own products that are both considered more on the high-end to drugstore to even organic home remedies found at supermarkets/health shops.  I like to try different products and have tried hand creams from La Mer, Shiseido, Origins, Avene, Loccitane, to Nivea, Aquaphor, just to name just a few.  Over the last year, I've neglected my hands--and for the first time in my life, I've developed some dry and rough patches on my palms.  They're scratchy now (gasp).  My manicurist of 9 years recommended this little jar for my hands after she almost cut her hand while massaging my hands during a manicure.  The Lactic (AHA) and Salicylic (BHA) acids really help soften the hands.  But you really have to slather it on and wear 100% cotton gloves for at least 30 minutes.  You can wear latex gloves as well for the same time.  After you take off the gloves, you're going to feel your hands itch, you're going to want to scratch... This is bad, but I do it.  I always see and feel dead skin as I rub or scratch those rough patches.<br /><br />Wash my hands, and ta-da! Softer hands.  I had to do this 2-3 times that same week, for all the rough patches to disappear.  Then I either use the Origins Hand Treatment Cream or Loccitane Shea Butter Hand Cream for maintenance.  Tt does the same for my feet.  I have to wear gel socks for 30 minutes to get baby smooth feet.<br /><br />I recommend this product because personally, it let me reverse 1 year's hand neglect, within 1 week.
B00ES0Z206|5|Incredible product
B004UL0GTK|3|Works really well for a couple of hours, but on my stick straight, thick coarse hair, it doesn't last.
B000ARWLIM|1|I had been looking for a lighted handheld mirror for my mom.  When it arrived, I was very disappointed in its function.  The &#34;lighted&#34; portion is to small lights where the handle connects to the mirror.  It might allow you to see a little better if you were trying to use the mirror in pitch dark but it hardly adds any noticeable light in normal to low lighting.  This product is not worth the money in my opinion.
B008V9UU1Q|5|Great color.  Dark purple that changes color in the sun.  Has a red tone, dark purple and blues depending on the light.
B004Y9GY44|5|I watched many a you tube videos that describes how great the product is so i purchased it here cheaper than in ulta, walgreens or even cvs. wow it does everything it claims and does not crease up into fine lines so amazing!!
B00L9RJTKK|5|Great Argan Oil.  Can't find a better price.  The best part is there is no dropper. to break or spill over,  it is powered by a pump.<br /><br />organic too!
B000G0GW6K|4|I like this thing. It works well, the charge lasts. I just don't understand how to use the bikini accessory.
B00283O7LK|5|Compare to the metal nail file I used, this makes my nails very smooth.<br /><br />The only concern is that it is made of glass, so it may break.  But well, that's why protective case is included.<br /><br />Very nice!
B00H7IKUXU|5|Bought this for my daughter for christmas and she said her hands are soft as silk.  She uses alot of scrubs and loves this one.  Now i need to get one (:
B000G3JVSS|2|The quality of the brush is poor---had to use one of my own.<br /> I must have a small face because the stencils are all too big... will not purchase again
B0012FE9SQ|5|I love this lotion, it is nice and thick and helps out my really dry hands and it is good on my sensitive skin.
B008RBT2TE|4|I like this product and I wear it a lot. However I like to wear it with ponytails and I do wish the bottom part of it was also a braid rather than a black band so it looks more like my hair. I wasn't sure how the color would go but it matched my hair perfectly and was really shiny. I do have to adjust it throughout the day because the hair is slippery and it slides back on my head but it's overall very comfortable and fashionable.
B0000534VO|5|I bought Clean and Clear's Advantage acne clearing kit a while back. This face wash ran out first and this was a good price on Amazon!<br />I have been dabbling with different face washes. I used to use St. Ives apricot scrub but I feel like it used to leave a creamy residue on my skin after. I used Neutrogena's morning burst face wash which has a great smell and cleansed well - but I don't think it helped any of my acne blackheads or breakouts.<br />My dermatology resident friend recommended I use something with Benzoyl peroxide. So I tried this out and I like it so far! It's something good and cheap to start off a good regimen system.
B00JZFB13G|4|The new it thing , this sponge does wonders ❤️❤️
B000HX6KYA|5|Love this for quickly zapping zits!
B000SSDTTI|2|No. This is a weird product.<br />Choppy-but not in a cool way.
B001IN0V5M|5|This is EXACTLY what I was hoping it was going to be! I was going from memory!! And how fast you shipped it here! There is a purple perfume that is discontinued now from Victoria Secret that they sold in the same little bottle & I have been trying to remember the name & I can't remember. I would love to have a little bottle of that, also. If you know what I am talking about, please message me. I WILL be a repeat customer! Thanks so much for everything!
B00FFANXMM|4|I have seen age spots lighten.  The formula is very watery and dries out quickly.  You have to use a moisturizer only because it is like using alcohol on yr face.  It isn't anywhere near the potency it claims, where it says use sparingly. I am even using retina a, at night with this product. But it did lighten age spots better than anything I've used so far. I just thought it would also tighten the skin.  It's way to runny for that. I am not sure I'd I will reorder.
B005SGYX90|2|I purchased the 1.7 oz. version of this oil and received in the mail a nice bottle of Sea Buckthorn BERRY oil.  High quality, but not seed oil.  The picture for this product seems to be a generic vial of oil and does not look like the vial I received.  My oil is dark red and cloudy, not clear light amber.
B00ELS9ZUI|5|I love this perfume. My husband gave to me last Christmas and everybody around me ask me what perfume I'm wearing. Is light and feminine.
B00742JW8S|4|Okay, it's not perfect, I still have a few whispy hairs left after use (are they too short/thin?), but I gleaned that repeated use of this device over time will ultimately be my solution. I've looked pretty hairfree for over a month or two now, and it's been with almost no care or effort on my part. With a razor, you have a perfect full blanket of stubble in 3 days or so and wonder if it's worth it. It hurts like hell on places you're not supposed to use it on. But effective. I'm not yet sure about longterm small marks on the skin, I'm older so it's less of a concern to me. The first time I used it I thought I was going to jump out of my skin and was surprised at how much it hurt, and I've had regular electrology sessions for three years! I've decided I prefer waxing, but can't afford full-body treatments all the time, being on a budget. After a use or two I've grown accustomed to it and it doesn't seem to hurt anymore, until I try it on a new area (the instructions clearly state not to do this). I find it an effective longterm solution. No infected ingrown hairs yet (??) I like the device, it works, it's pretty, convenient, made well, durable, and inexpensive. Definitely a cheaper solution than the others I've tried, and with regular but infrequent maintenance it does the job. I appreciate the review and the tip here that you could do a full shaving first, and then use this periodically as hair begins to grow in. It doesn't get all hairs with each use, it's more of a some here and there or most each time, but over time definitely works and lasts *much* longer, with quick repeated uses here and there maintaining a hairless look indefinitely. I recommend this device, have not tried the others.
B000BNG4VU|5|This is one product that has truly stood the test of time.  My mother & mother in law love it.  It is very shear.
B002ZDO82G|5|The only lotion I would use!!  Plus at this price you can't go wrong.  I have been using this lotion for the past 10 years, and I have yet to find another one that even compares,  It is the perfect non greasy feel that lasts all day. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
B00008BFXJ|3|I have used Sonicare for years. It produces wonderful results in dental hygiene. I just received this new model. The entire package is encased in an impenetrable hard-plastic clamshell with no way to get in. You will need cutting tools and gloves. Be careful you don't damage the Sonicare or your hands when wrestling with this devilish and unnecessary covering. I didn't wear gloves and cut my hand on one of the razor-sharp plastic edges.  5 Stars for the Sonicare itself; 1 Star for the Packaging producing the 3 star result.
B003ICXCG6|5|I bought this for my wife and she has been using it for 2 years. It's very powerful so it can dry the hair within minutes. Highly recommended!
B00S0A1LZA|5|My face felt surprisingly clean, yet not at all dry after using this product.  It offers a great amount of exfoliation with a very pleasant scent.  I also love that it is vegan, organic, and natural.  It leaves out all of the ingredients that I wouldn't want on my face (parabens, GMOs, petrochemicals, etc.).  Great product!
B00336EUTK|4|Its ok<br />Product
B005MMYAZM|5|I have a lot of fine hair and sometimes have difficulty finding a hair dryer that won't fry it in the process of drying it. This dryer is awesome for fine hair; it takes about 15 minutes to dry my hair and I can even use the high function if I keep it on warm. I like that it has warm/hot AND low/high setting precisely because of this reason.
B00J5N0Y4U|5|Really satisfied with this product and would recommend this to friends and family! Thanks again-  Rebecca Schneider
B00AO379NE|5|My husband has been using this for about a month.  He likes it a lot, it keeps him from sweating and more importantly it doesn't quit working for him to start smelling.  There is very little smell to the antiperspirant itself, so if you like the low-smell toiletry items, this is for you.
B00ATFJ8NQ|5|Awesome!  I love it!
B0090N3SKM|5|The packaging is a little big so pretty much you can only use them at home or if you stick them in a backpack. The packaging seems well designed, a fold away adhesive that reseals when you open it to take a wipe out.  They are thick enough so I have never gone threw with my hand which is probably one of the most important parts.  Not much of a scent.  When you open a new package it is tough to get the first 2 or 3 out without ripping them but I just fold them in half to fix that.  Best of all works well for keeping me nice and clean.  I see a lot of bad reviews because of the price, you know the price when you buy it.  If its to much per wipe the don't buy it, simple enough.
B00F5ABBS0|5|This is everything to me! Once I up my collections on blushes, bases,skin finish powders, and bronzers, I will definitely buy another one. Immediately, it makes it all look organize and cute. Just do yourself a favor and get it.
B0049ACS34|1|Smells so bad!
B00I3OMMCO|4|Smells good and keeps my beard smooth and manageable and my skin free of dandruff. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn't have and hold for my mustache, but I guess this is meant to be more of a conditioner than a beard holder.
B013HDSA3K|1|it was the best ever until they changed the scent. Now it smells like vomit.
B000EEVAII|3|i like estee Lauder products. And i been buying fruition extra for years but for some reason these samples smelled funny and cream looked darker then usual. So maybe these samples were old. Because that never happened to me b4 when i bought it from the mall. But fruition is a great product, very sad that it has been discontinued
B007VNL0ZI|5|great parfume, super fast shipping, good price, thanks.
B007GC6ZX6|5|I've had a problem with dry cracking hands every winter.  Anita's Balm is the first product i've found in 25 years that repaired and prevented it!  Thank's Anita!
B001G7PLMS|5|Wonderful, effective product which I use daily!  Not available here, so your supplying this is essential!
B0015KHMRS|1|I can't rate this low enough, this is HORRIBLE! Absolute garbage, it stopped working after a month. I sent it in for repairs, but they apparently consider &#34;repair&#34; to mean &#34;do nothing&#34; because after waiting for weeks for it to return in the mail, it still didn't work. I asked to get it exchanged for another product, that stopped working after a short while too! AVOID ALL WAHL PRODUCTS.
B00793LFN2|4|You won't have to hide the brush away. It's made with an elegant matte black plastic. The bristles seem strong and they have the nice angled side which helps clean your nails. Fast shipping at a good price.
B000P22TW0|1|It is an very cheap curve I will not buy it again.. you can hardly smell; that's after 15 sprays. This is the worst deal ever. Everybody just buy the expensive one from the store!!!!!!
B00443YJ8I|5|Cute & colorful. Nice clip too.will be pretty in the flower girls hair at my nieces wedding. And, they girls can wear them after wards too.
B00ON1GWMM|5|Super lightweight and doesn't clump or flake. Haven't worn another mascara since receiving this free from Influenster for testing purposes. Definitely will be buying more!
B00BOJY0NY|5|Wow! Just wow. This is one amazingly beautiful perfume! The opening kind of shocked me, and not in a good way, because it was a crazy strong blast of marigolds, which if you garden you know it's kind of a stinker. BUT, after five minutes it's a truly lovely, cuddly floral with a waxy tuberose that doesn't overpower. It's the kind of perfume they don't make any more--strong and very, very long-lasting.  I am so in love with this!!! Try it...it's an old-school gem. Make sure you get this one, the Balenciaga and not the reformulated Ted Lapidus....that one is nice, but it's really not Rumba!
B0002WTGCE|5|I was skeptical about this at first, but it's doing the job. My fungus-infected nail is more than half grown out with clean nail after 2 months of use. It's *very* important that you apply it correctly, though. Don't just brush it on the nail. You need to put ONE DROP on the edge of the nail, where the fungus has cracked and fractured the nail, and get it to soak in. The idea is to get the stuff INSIDE the nail, not on top of it. You'd be wise to use a knife blade to cut back on the damaged nail as well. That gets the juice in to where it will do the most good. As noted, you don't need a lot of this fluid. One drop, perhaps followed by another drop in the same place once the first drop has soaked in, twice a day, is the way to go. I'm really surprised that the package doesn't include instructions like these.
B004I10TDK|5|excellent!!
B002RGRJC2|5|I don't know much about this at all but my mother got it for Christmas and she loves the stuff, so I guess that's a good rating if ever there was one?
B002RNVV2O|5|These oils by Eden's Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.
B001KYW7KQ|5|Hi, I received the product on time. Conair is a trusted brand.These rollers stretch the hair for better drying.  Thank you!
B001BLRYMO|5|Because had small, medium,large rollers and they get gei hot.What my wife was looking for.She said that she would recomend to a friend.
B0020MMD06|3|This is a heavy, rich, caramel/almond gourmand. While pleasant in small doses, it is incredibly sweet and gets overwhelming and cloying really fast. I find this scent to be sort of flat, it smells yummy but seems like it is missing something so I usually wear it over another fragrance in which I want to pump up the vanilla/caramel notes. There is nothing interesting about this fragrance alone; it is about as intriguing as the vanilla scented candles you can find in every store ever.
B001B12XZM|5|I am a big user of shaving soaps rather than cream because they have a more moisturizing affect on my skin. I have several Gold dacha products and this is one of my favorite scents. It is a shame that gold dacha Hungarian mustache wax is hard to find because it is also excellent. Almost out and I can't fly overseas and buy some more.
B00621FDC6|4|very good
B00B8ZH6NU|5|Wife LOVES this soap!
B00C7DYBX0|4|I am a licensed esthetician and I recently purchased this serum.I have been using it for a few weeks now on myself for my lines on my forehead,my frown lines between my eyes and around my lips.So far,i love it! It has smoothed them out and they made them less dramatic.I recommend it.
B00ARF42D4|1|Great reviews for a bad product. Battery lasted 3 months. Now a full charge lasts less than 2 minutes. Claims to not pull beard hair, but the adjustment guard only enhances snagging and pulling of the hair. Great price for a bad product. I am never buying a Norelco product again and I highly advise against this trimmer.
B0058SY1XQ|4|very nice trimmer. just not shower friendly.
B0056Z278M|5|I have to start off by saying that I bought this product at the mall. I just can't buy cologne on the internet without even knowing what it smells like. If you are able to do so more power to you and I hope this review helps. When I went to the mall I smelled L'Homme, L'Homme Libre and La Nuit de L'Homme all by YSL. L'H smells nice and clean but the scent disappears pretty quickly and the LNDL'H is VERY spicy and very strong. I found that L'HL was the best of both worlds. Strong enough to last and give the cologne a good oomph of manliness without being over powering. I will say that I will most certainly buy this product on Amazon. The 3.3oz bottle was $83 in stores, the 2 oz was $60. They had a gift set with a 3.3oz and 1.3oz together for $88 so I bought that. SO EXPENSIVE.
B0062IWQVU|5|I am completely happy with the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler Power Trimmer. I received the free razor from a program run by Gillette. First of all the Trimmer is made pretty sturdy. The handle is comfortable enough for trimming up even the biggest of jobs without hurting your hand. And what I liked about it is it's not too loud. That way I can shave without waking up my wife and kids. And it's waterproof so I can shave in the shower without having to clean up that big mess all over the sink. The trimmer works great! I recommend it!
B008HBMVZ6|5|Ever since moving to an apartment with free heat using radiators my face and skin has been so dry. I would put hand cream on my face and it would still be dry in the morning. I decided to try this intense hydration cream for my night cream after my shower and it is amazing. It is not oily of any type, but it is thick. It kinda smells a little weird, but when I wake up in the morning my face is still moisturized. I also tried the day cream and was amazed by that was well, same results but a little lighter for the morning.<br /><br />I will stick with this cream for awhile!
B00IA5MYT2|5|I use this everyday, its a very nice set for the price.
B0046797WK|1|I bought this trying to save money, after years of using Dior, Sephora, etc.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good, but this wasn't even close. I can barely tell I'm wearing mascara,even with two coats. And worst of all, it flakes into my eyes all day. This is going in the trash. Don't waste your money - buy the good stuff!
B005765P3O|5|My skin is extremely sensitive, and even a new razor can rip up my skin pretty easily and keep it red for over a day. This shave cream is great for keeping my legs in one piece, and it seems to protect the skin enough that I can even start to use a cheaper shave cream (on occasion) without my legs being as greatly damaged. Yay!
B001ET77H0|5|I have used the straight Brut deodorant for a LONG time now.  My wife loves this scent, so I was glad to be able to find it for such a good price here on Amazon.  I don't like antiperspirants - this deodorant-only little gel is perfect.
B005OKPZR4|5|Of course there are better body lotions out there, but you are going to pay dearly for them. This product has always come through for me and my very dry skin. It's light and non-greasy, and the shea butter and oatmeal make my dry skin much less itchy, especially in the winter months. It has a light, pleasant scent.
B003F16OOW|5|Love the smell of this perfume and would recommend it all my friends. Just an all around great perfume and its not too overwhelming.
B005CK3QQ8|4|I got this because my dentist told me it was better than wax floss.<br />I still enjoy wax floss, I guess old habits die hard, but this is gentler on your teeth and i can see how the thick soft material could be more effective at getting stuff out from between teeth.
B003TJ8IVC|5|Great product, great value size.
B00P6NZ902|4|Love love so soft 😍 can't wait to use them
B00P8CQK90|5|Great product and fast shipping. Used in a couple of homemade facial products. My friend likes it so well she is planning to buy some.
B00SGBTOYI|5|My review wont be as extensive! All I will say is this product is phenomenal! I have tried them all! I have tried the Crest, Colgate and this product beats them all! After 1 treatment I noticed drastic difference! Please buy buy buy!
B000F4EMP0|2|This leaves my hair extremely dry, like no other product I've ever used. You CAN NOT use this without a conditioner or something else afterwards unless your hair goals include looking like you were just electrocuted.
B00N996X4G|5|I love it. I just started using it so I can't say I look 15 yrs younger but I love how soft it makes the area around my eyes feel. And my makeup seems to look smoother in that area as well. I plan to only use this at night so it may take some time to reap any true benefits but I love it and will continue to incorporate this in my regimen.
B0016BC2BM|3|Don't really think it makes a difference.
B004NYWR7S|5|these are great you only have to use one swipe and it covers the whole nail and shiny enough you don't have to use a top coat.
B003ZVYQRY|3|This stuff smells wonderful in the bottle but after about maybe 20 minutes on your skin it doesn't smell like anything.  The roller ball applicator is really cool, I just wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer.
B000641YKA|5|It's the best lubrication I've ever come across. It does what it says in the name; it glides across the body. One drop goes a long way.
B0000ZHOEU|5|Love this cleanser! Not only does it remove everything, including ALL my eye makeup (even mascara) - it's gentle, doesn't sting, and suds up easily. This cleanser would be great for all skins. I have normal skin and just love it. I have used it w/ both my Clarisonic and now my Foreo Luna.
B000WBOORW|5|GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper & trustworthy-that’sImportant
B00CQGUT3E|5|I was very pleased and satisfy. Love the product an ready to order another one but different color.. 😄😄😄
B001V9LULM|5|This product when used with the Toner helps prevent black heads! Works great with dry skin as well! Great product!
B00FRDPQPO|5|Nice scent and leaves hair feeling manageable and conditioned. Definitely an item I would buy again.
B000W7SV0W|5|I use this as a setting powder around my eyes, and I have not fond one that is better. I hate the brush (i just throw it away, since it molts) and the container, but they are a small price to pay for this glorious product.
B00CKFMRD6|5|I chose this rating because I bought it for a friend as a gift and they loved it. I also loved it. I so recommend buying this bag for all the women who loves purses and handbags. I did expect it to be bigger but that doesn't matter because as long as everyone loves it then it's good.
B001E6O9M4|5|This shampoo has always done wonders for my hair, where others leave my hair brittle and feeling like a pile of hay. It works up into a huge lather without much work, and always rinses out cleanly. I have to scratch my head at the reviews of people here not liking the scent. Maybe they're used to Pantene or that &#34;ultra-clean&#34; sterile salon smell? This stuff rules! It's got this subtle spice smell that I've had many compliments on over the years. And more importantly, it keeps my hair and scalp healthy.
B001Q8XQVK|5|great colors and look nice in hair
B00J1OZQBO|4|Love the scent! A present for best friend who travels.
B00HCR09VO|5|I have rather pale skin and dark hair and have tried many types of tanning lotions and pads. They've all done an okay job on my legs and arms but I have been disappointed in the way they look on my face. They have usually ended up looking too orange or too fake, and worse of all, splotchy if you don't apply them completely evenly all over which as many of you know is not as easy as it sounds<br /><br />I got these pads because I read about them in a magazine like Us or People or something like that.  I usually don't get my cosmetics advice from a magazine but for some reason these caught my eye when they were described as adding glow to one's skin.<br /><br />So I ordered them, and I was really pleasantly surprised with the results when I tried them at home. The pads themselves are quite small and are very white in color. They turn a little darker as you smooth them over your face, neck and d&eacute;colletage. At first I thought the pads were too small to cover that much area effectively  but it was no problem.<br /><br />I noticed the difference seemingly within minutes, and more so as the day went on. It's not simply that your skin starts to have more color, it's that it really does glow with a healthy, sun-kissed look. (I know that tanning isn't good for your skin but you know what I mean about looking healthy with that kind of an outdoorsy glow.)<br /><br />I was really happy and I do plan on adding them to my morning routine. Or maybe I should clarify and say every other morning - these do get you quite tan so for me, I find that I get the look that I want by using them every other day. Note that you can use these at night or in the morning.<br /><br />I now find I can use little or not foundation or blush when I get ready to go out. It's nice because I have older skin and I think a lot of makeup can end up be more aging and unflattering and truly less is more.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00D8QMKAG|5|Products and service all very good.  I expect to bd basck for more.
B004BD13XU|5|This is great mascara for the price.  I have used many more expensive brands that doesn't equal the quality of this one. Your eyelashes stay soft but look great!
B002ZH6U5A|3|Bought this for my 2 year old son, this did not even last 6 months before the face that flips up broke. Definitely wasn't being handled hard either, b/c my son could not even reach it so I was the one getting the toothbrush and putting it back in.
B0047PPCAW|5|Makes your skin look amazing and feel amazing. I have already noticed an improvement in my fine lines & wrinkles as well as my dark circles!
B000E7YL1I|5|courteous service, I really liked the product, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This product is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.
B003JOKVVC|5|This stuff is amazing for menopause symptoms !! Couldn't live with out it
B000IJLQOW|5|fabulous
B00373FPKC|5|Love it!!! Came right on time and will order from them again & again!!!
B00FRS0TC4|5|Nice smell, gentle to skin, and refreshing
B008U1Q4DI|5|Bigger than I expected, but these jewels are great for shining up your manicure, and are easy to apply with some top coat.
B001MHNQYW|5|EXCELENTE!
B006ZA0A5Y|5|So is there any down time with this peel???
B0014AI4VM|5|So I started using this and I LOVE IT! My teeth are so clean I went for a deep cleaning at my dental office and they said that now I just can get a regular cleaning, this pretty much did the deep cleaning for them lol! Amazing! I would HIGHLY recommended. Also it is a true space saver, that tiny little charger is powerful and tiny! AWESOME PRODUCT, arrived on time! Just over all awesome!
B0009RL86E|5|This was a great deal and it worked!!! The company who maked this product has never let me down ever!!!
B00371SV5U|4|This stuff beats out all of the rest.It will make a hair stand up on a table.Ha-Ha But very true it is the best for holding even the toughest hair where you want it.The only thing is that someone said they puchased it at Walgreen's for $2.00 per bottle and I paid $4.00 per bottle.Bummer.
B0009F3OR2|5|i have used this conditioner for several years and because of cost i've tried to find others. i always come back to this one, though, because it conditions the best. i have very fine, wavy hair that is weighed down easily, but this product doesn't cause problems with my hair (as i've seen other reviewers note). i have very light highlights over most of my hair and it tends to dry out and break if i don't use this and i always get comments from my hairstylist that my hair looks &#34;too healthy&#34; given the processing she puts it through.
B000AN8SQA|5|It is a beautiful barrette and it is obviously of very high quality.<br />It does hold my extremely thick hair but is a tiny bit tight.  I will probably use it for containing half my hair as it is much too beautiful to return.  It would probably work well for most with thick hair though as my thickness is unusual and I am also a curly.  The design is so lovely and looks so nice on my hair (which is very dark brown/black) that I am looking for other products with this design.<br />I will certainly order from FranceLuxe again.
B001JTK308|5|I would definately purchase this twice. The quality is still good, and it's been a few months since I've bought this item. I use this Du-Rag everyday, and it's still going strong. The fact that you can adjust the tightness of it makes it ideal for me.
B00HBSC3JA|5|You want to keep your facial hair fresh.  Don't forget to shampoo.
B004P2LL2K|3|This works some of the time....When the firmx turns white and you rub it with a qtip (moistened) you make extra wrinkles show,<br />It is not all it is cracked up to.  About 1 out of 10 times have I been happy with it.  It drys if the cap is not tightened.
B003YJAZZ4|5|Haven't it had it long...........but so far so good! Had an electric corded razor so having it cordless is really nice.  Husband walks around the house while shaving! Nice super smooth shave!  Would highly recommend it
B00USLI2JM|5|This is great! Very powerful and does the job getting rid of that dead dry skin on my heels! Love it!!
B003NCXXIS|5|From one hairy guy to another, this thing works great!  If you have not shaved before, it takes a few for your skin to adjust.
B001N0OOF8|3|Nice for Summer use.  Refreshing after shower as it is not too heavy.
B00NJ22TGO|4|Just as described. .
B003Y35UQO|4|it does work. use it consistently.
B009YE6JDK|2|(Wife) I actually had no problem at all with my kit until I emailed the people asking if primer came with it! THey said it did, indeed yet it was not there when I received so I emailed them. They claimed it didn't come with primer.. No biggie but I was a little PO'd considering I could have had it by the time I got my kits.. Then I realized I didn't get the pump or brush holder.. I emailed them again and they asked for a picture, which to me is poor customer service anyway.. I sent them a picture and they still won't replace the missing parts! I'm blown away.. I have never had such a bad experience on amazon and I will never hop with these people again! I'm tired of talking through emails. I just want my stuff taken care of!
B00C8YCFU4|3|It's very similar to other Mud masks, but I LOVE mud masks, so it's alright by me!
B00HMD6DBI|1|My scar I had for  3months is still the same I purchased this scar remover 3weeks ago using 3times still no improvement
B00AUVJ8W0|5|Great craft man ship and beautiful as well. Easy to use in hair and looks great. Got several comments on it. Would recommend this seller.
B00OQUP9GU|5|This is an awesome product at an amazing price... Review over! LOL<br /><br />I am a fan of most things containing almonds. So when I was asked to give this Almond Oil a try, it was an easy yes for me. And I am so glad I did...this stuff is wonderful!<br />This oil is light on the skin and has very little if any scent at all. I was hoping for more scent as I like the the way almonds smell but I don't notice any scent in this product. And yes, when using it with essential oils as a carrier, you would want little or no scent to compete with the added oils.<br /><br />So far my favorite was to use it is just as a lotion in the kitchen. Just a drop is all that is needed after washing my hands. It absorbs completely and doesn't leave a &#34;film&#34; on my hands.<br /><br />Some of the other ways I have used this oil do include as a carrier for my essential oils, a scalp massage and a couple of times in cooking (added it to pasta to keep from sticking). I imagine there are so many other uses for this oil and it will be one that I keep in stock from now on<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.
B000RKN6EA|5|This product has a rather unpleasant smell, but it works wonderfully. The false eyelashes remained adhered to my eyelids the whole night (of partying), but were easy to remove at the end of the night. highly recommend!
B001063NY8|5|This is really good stuff.  Ive used Tea Tree Oil 4 years n this is the real thing.
B000TBW6AC|1|Comb is sharp on the end of the teeth - not great.
B006IYRPB4|2|Cant use the ink
B00G8OQODY|5|I have used many high end dark spot corrector products ,but this one acts better and faster than all others on the market.It leaves a fresh non oily looking on my face and gives me a beautiful glow instantly.I'm using it for about 20 days now and the dark spots are really fading and my skin tone got much better over all.I have a light-med skin but the fair (no 1 ) works better on me . So far,I have no cons for this produce.Love it and would definitely buy it again.
B001ECTZNG|5|I put this on after I wash my face, and before I put on my regular light face lotion. My face instantly feels more refreshed, and it never clogs my pores. I've integrated this into my daily routine, and would not go another day without it.
B00CRKHGUS|5|Had this flat iron three months now. My hair is fine/thick/curly. It drives me crazy## this clat iron was perfect! I cant put alot of oil and products in my hair because it gets stiff, this iron smooths my ends and my hair has grown alot due to me clipping my ends, heat protection and this flat iron every two weeks! Thanks ISA#
B0012RXXMM|5|Big time Pronce fan here! I love this perfume!
B00ATDTYS2|3|The polishes themselves are very vibrant, not necessary something i would have picked it on my own but what got me mad is that the polish tops broke off.
B000052YQU|5|I love this cream. Leaves my skin so soft. I also use it as body lotion. For me, this stuff is the best thing on the market. Coming from me it means a lot. I been known to spend 100 of dollars on facial cream and this stuff is better than those. When you have a good thing don't let it go for the Johnny's come lately just b/c they have a fancy name and seem like the very best. Those creams advertise sea algae and many other great ingredients.  But, Ill stick to my inexpensive ponds which doesn't hold a stick to any of those creams, Thank you! I HIGHLY recommend!!!
B00099XKOU|5|My three year old daughter loves this toothpaste. I also bought one for her brother and he loves it as well. Parents beware that your kids will want to brush their teeth all day!
B001A3ML3K|1|Thank God I didn't buy this product, my husband got it for free from his sister-in-law for treating his minor acne (now I know why she gave away easily this pretty expensive product). I had few blemishes on my face because of my period, so I decided to help my skin get over it - big mistake!!! I applied the repair treatment lotion before going to bed, and the next morning I came to work with my face burning and as red as a stoplight. By lunch time, the skin on my face was burning and hurting so bad I wanted just to burry my face in a bowl of ice!!! My face is red and swollen all over, and I pray it goes away by tomorrow. I don't know if this is an allergy, or a literal skin burn, or if this how this stuff works. It's definitely not for me. It might work for other people with skin not so sensitive, but PLEASE - don't put this directly on your skin, try it on your elbow first or other piece of skin where it's not visible in case it has reaction.
B007DGUREI|3|This body butter has a nice texture, and price. Delivery was great.<br />The problem I have with it is that I don't like the scent.<br />It reminds me of armpits that need deodorant that are slightly covered by a mango scent.
B000Z4NDLO|5|I have used this stuff for at least 10 years and I haven't aged a bit. :-)  I haven't gotten a burn on my face since I started using it.  Also, makeup goes on much smoother with this on.  I get the spf 40 and it's not too thick or anything.  LOVE THIS&#62;  I would sacrifice other things I buy to buy this.
B001H54VJI|5|I would not want to be without this product.  I spray it on my hair in between shampoos and it keeps it looking and smelling good! I think the Vor-Mag water, which they describe as \\"water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that we believe to be more beneficial\\", has something to do with it, as well as the rose flower oil itself, of course. :)
B00FKHBCX2|5|Great product at great price.
B000C216J0|5|She likes it & it smells good. It is inexpensive & hard to find in stores. When she's happy, I receive the benefits. Try it for your wife or girlfriend - maybe I'll get those benefits too!
B00A6QAJYA|5|We love the The Village Company!
B00012NJKU|5|very nice gentle cleanser that actually cleans without residue
B0058E3XJI|5|This tanning lotion is the best I've used so far, it makes me pretty dark. I also like how silky it is, it isn't too thick.
B00H2YL8W6|5|best brushes i have used in a long time
B009WQH8SA|5|I had been looking for an alternative to conventional shaving foam and happened across this in the store.  It does work as advertised and as they note in the instructions, a little goes a loooong way, meaning you can get a lot of mileage out of one tube versus several cans of shaving foam.  It does give you a very close shave, that feels very &#34;slick&#34; (their word, not mine).  I use it for both shaving my face and head and it works great in both locations.  It's taken some trial and error to figure out the proper amount (too little and it doesn't do what it needs to do, too much and your eyes can become overwhelmed), but I've got it down now and I'm very pleased with it.<br /><br />Only complaint is the smell is a weird citrus-y/medicine-y smell that isn't altogether pleasing.
B0017KCPUK|1|I used to have a glass file from one of the Avon lines, and I loved it. When I lost it during a move from one apartment to another, I was devastated--it was the perfect nail file. I saw this product at Target and assumed it would be of similar quality, if not better. (After all, this is Revlon we're talking about!)<br /><br />Blinded by trust, I purchased the file and brought it home. Sure enough, it worked beautifully.... for the first few times I used it. Like everyone else here, I purchased a product that basically stopped working after the first  3-4 times that I used it. Minimal use wore off the rough crystal edging and left smooth, useless patches that appear to have no remedy. I've scoured the internet looking for ways to fix it, but the only solution seems to be buying another nail file. Obviously, I will not be purchasing another from Revlon.<br /><br />Very disappointing and certainly not what the product advertised.
B00BB3K5JQ|5|I used to use the axe paste but was more expensive and contained less product until I found<br />OGX Mens Texturizing Paste I love it keeps my hair in place without a greasy or crunchy feel
B00016WU6A|5|I just recently found this product while searching for detoxing products.  I have Lyme Disease  and do a lot of hot yoga to detox my body.  I was excited to try this after reading so many great reviews.  I was very impressed with how much I was sweating without moving.  The smell is great and the water in the tub turns yellow but it's not messy to clean at least not in my tub.  It washes down very easily.<br />My husband came down with a sinus infection and I told him he needed to take a bath in this.  He went to urgent care and got a prescription for Amoxicillin.  The med would not be ready until the next day so he took a both in this and by the next day was feeling great and didn't even need the prescription.<br />You sweat A LOT!  Even after the bath you bundle up with a hat and still sweat.  You have to be careful standing up because you can get lightheaded.  You will also be very tired after the bath.  Best to just go to sleep all warm.  You will also feel a warning sensation all over your body for 20 min after.
B00ASIRBXI|5|Great
B001HNFC3Y|5|I gave this to a very close friend last Christmas - he told me the heavenly scent filled the room beautifully then, and as of today, January 29, it's still as fragrant as ever.  And this is without even lighting it! On that basis I would highly recommend this lovely candle.
B004RDSISC|1|These ponytails do have the metal clasp that others have commented on. After only one wear, the elastic pulls apart from the clasp, and the outer material is stretched thin. Often the material actually snaps. I have to wear at least two in my hair at a time in order to hold the hair tightly enough. These are terrible.
B000WIHR92|4|I like suave shampoo and conditioner because it gets my hair clean and it smells good, too.  It is a good value
B00G5OJ3Q2|4|Love the double cream!!!! Wish it didnt cost so much. It moisturizes very well. Sallys, Walgreens have this product.<br /><br />jax fl
B000Q7XDR4|4|A friend recommended this product to me and I'm very glad she did! It helps keep your tan but it's also an excellent moisturizer. My skin has firmed up a little bit and my tan seems darker when I use this lotion. I didn't give it five stars because I wasn't too fond of the smell. However, I completely recommend this product. Great buy!
B0055L51A8|5|Have used this for years. Love the way it smells and cleans! Wanted a small size for my overnight toiletry bag.
B000RHLK8C|5|Really love this sunscreen. Not sticky, fragrance free, fine for face, reasonable cost. Perfect!
B00GA78CPC|4|My mom broke these within a couple of weeks. To be fair, she is a little rough on glasses so they may last quite a bit longer with proper care.
B00KUTUNU8|1|Again, a complete waste of money, plastic too soft to have any affect, no pain relief no joy, just another con...as a bunion sufferer (and you guys reading this will relate) one seeks relief! No relief here,
B004NYWR7S|5|Vivid.  Lasting color.  Unique shades.  Tons of compliments.  Inspired me to begin building my collection of full-sized bottles in these shades, as well as others.  I wish the Metallic Navy were available in full-sized, but it is only available within this gift set so I sub with metallic charcoal.<br /><br />I recommend.
B00022F1DW|5|works so well!  great for dry scalp conditions.  doesn't leave hair limp or stripped.  love the smell too.
B0067H6JGY|3|kind of waxy. I will use it on arms, but not on face again due to feel
B000GHWX3Y|4|This is one of my sister's favorites.  She got hooked on it years ago when you could still pick it up cheap in a local discout store.  Now it is getting harder to find.<br /><br />My sister requested this for her birthday and I found it on Amazon. Since she and I have like tastes in perfume, I thought I would like to try it too, so I bought two bottles and kept one.<br /><br />It is a wonderful smelling eau de toilette. I am glad I bought myself one.  My sister was really happy I found it for her.  There is just one issue.  I noticed when the bottles arrived one was leaking a little, so I kept that one and gave her the other one.  When she opened it, hers was leaking a little too.. hence the 4star rating rather than a 5 star.<br /><br />But the smell of it is worth losing a little.  The bottle is too big to carry in your purse, so I just make sure I am careful with it.
B00IWURUSU|4|I had one of these before but lost it. It is made of cheap stamped metal = thus the four stars, but is a helpful tool for straightening out misaligned fake eyelashes. With more practice I have more luck with my fingers and tweezers.
B00GTUEA8S|5|When you need a foamer bottle nothing else will suffice.  This bottle was priced fairly, arrived in a timely fashion, works and is perfect for travel.
B00163UR5I|5|Fast! Thank You! Would use you again. Love the price. Opi has wonderful colors. Lady a long time.  Love the product
B00BAIUECK|4|I'm an adult and I think this might be made for kids, it is a little tight on my head.
B00979C5EE|3|Not my favorite, I like the moisturizing one better!
B00292BRAO|3|Great job as a trimmer but my ears literally RING after using this- on my boys- who complain that it's sonic jet loud!
B00846G0M4|5|I have ordered this product often from various vendors. This one meets my needs and appears to work as well as any others that I've ordered. One of the things that I highly recommend it for - women - after shaving legs, underarms, bikini area - apply and eliminate all irritation - no razor bumps, no itching and no irritation. It works for me. Plus, it's natural - no unsafe, harmful materials.
B00CC63LKQ|3|good silver gray not last very long though.
B00J1QGLGG|5|The jasmine smell is so aromatic this product makes you feel good. It makes your skin so soft and smooth I will order this again. This supplemented other cowboy products I purchased and I like all I have bought. Definately will purchase these products again
B000C211TK|3|The smell is excellent. It smells very vanilla-y. I read that a lot of people get complements on this fragrance, but I don't see how this is possible. After about 5 minutes, the smell is nearly gone. It has no staying power at all.
B000225ZX8|5|I ordered this stuff originally for a sweet weekend with my out of town boyfriend.  Two days later my best friend called and said she saw my man with his ex.  Then the order came the day he was supposed to show up, along with other weekend goodies.  Well, in spite of my stinging eyes I grabbed the LUSH bar and rubbed it into my neck, shoulders, arms, wherever I could reach.  I loved the smell, the way it melted into my hands and into my skin, the slight tingle.  I use it any time I feel tense. Too bad for the boyfriend, more LUSH for me!
B0047ELN2O|4|A good shampoo and smells nice (I can't explain it. its a clean smell, not floral but salon-y) but you use a lot of product each time somehow. I wouldn't buy it again - for cheaper sulphate free shampoos look into Trader Joe's - all of theirs are sulphate-free.
B00RAR6NI4|5|I love this lip balm. It is very different from all other lip moisturizers I have used. The product goes on smooth and its thin. Chapstick and other products with petroleum are thick and feel like lard when applied. The flavoring took some getting used to but they are delicious flavors.
B000PI13SU|5|Great system that works exactly as described.  The filtration system works and you can notice the difference in the softness of your hair and skin... but that's only for the few people that are sensitive/critical with &#34;that sort of stuff.&#34;  My husband doesn't seem to notice a difference, but he isn't one to pay attention to how soft skin his skin is.  The set up was relatively easy - just detach old shower head and screw the pieces in.  I miss having a detachable shower head, but we have a really small stall so it wasn't a huge deal.  I bought this at $50 on an Amazon Lightning Deal, so I am writing this review with the premise of paying that much for this product.  I may be a bit more critical if I payed $100... it should perform miracles at that price.<br /><br />Overall good product that works as I expected.  I would only recommend it on a steep discount.
B0006PKGJY|5|Great value.  I have used it for years.
B006KC6T9I|5|I've been using this mask for 7 months now on an almost weekly basis. This mask, along with my Clarisonic brush has helped clear my skin up. you need to use it on a regular basis, every week or every other. And be patient, it can take a few months. In addition, it's got all the other benefits that other reviewers have stated while being all natural :) a must try!
B000MCZIMQ|5|Very nice fragrance and effective in keeping the skin smooth.
B00BB8ZIW0|5|Very happy with this blow dryer.
B007ML0OY2|5|At first i didn't know how to use it but since watching some Youtube videos now i know how to use it! :) Very Easy to use!!
B00A5E4YJ4|5|Love it !!
B005I0389W|5|They are very small. They are perfect for my yorkie who doesn't like bows & are so cute on her.
B0036YMVEU|1|I have long lashes that are unfortunately very light colored. I hate having to always wear mascara so thought I had happened on a great product. I think eventually with some product revisions it will be good but right now, stay away! the dye works great but the application is very messy as the package comes with what is basically hard Q-Tips to apply and a dropper to get it on there. I tried multiple times to get the two step application on evenly and consistently and even had my husband try to help. Ended up I had a mess on my counter as well as on my face. My eyelid ended up getting stained! I may try one more time after I pick up an eyelash comb but strongly recommend to the company to find a better application system.
B0099YS71W|5|Wonderful scent that takes me back to Cortona Italy every time I walk through the door of my home after a long day of work. Molto Bene!
B000CSDDDG|5|This towels are the best to scrub your body with. I have been searching for them and now I ordered a lot to have on hand.
B002DHVAZW|5|Cleans well and has a nice clean odour.
B002D463HA|5|I lost 10 pounds in 30 days using metabolic nutrition thyrene 45
B00VKHKH8C|5|Received in a timely manner and so far it's going well as I use it for my eyes![[ASIN:B00VKHKH8C Tea Tree Essential Oil - Big 4 oz - 100% Pure & Natural Melaleuca Therapeutic Grade - PREMIUM QUALITY from Australia for acne and skin tag removal]]
B000065DJY|1|ABSOLUTELY DANGEROUS! I agree with the other reviewer.  I've had three of these. THREE! The first one I'd had for a few years before it began smoking at the cord. I thought it was defective. Since it was out of warranty, I just went out and bought another one. One year later it met the same fate.  It started smoking where the cord meets the dryer.  I turned it off.  When I went to unplug it, it shot sparks at the power outlet.  I have a habit of wrapping the cord around the unit to store it. I thought that maybe I was responsible for these failures, that my coiling the cable was damaging the wiring. As now I believed that this hazard was my fault, I bought a 3rd unit and this time I never coiled the cord. I even went as far as reinforcing the flexible shield where the cord meets the dryer in hopes that it would keep stress off the cable. One year later, It began shorting out and getting super hot at the connection. I'm done! This unit should be recalled!
B001HKR6WM|4|Let's just say this is one of the best investment I've made on amazon for makeup at least. Love how they come individually pack with title. PERFECT! I currently still use some iteams Mostly the blending brush.
B00NUI3KWO|5|Son loves them, he grips them with ease. He loves the WWE wrestlers on them.
B0031KNP12|1|I wanted to  return it to get a refund but could not find a number to call on Amazon  I wanted the cologne --instead I got the body splash and lotion.  They both smelled AWFUL  must have been very old.  I just gave it to the poor. I wont order on Amazon if I can not talk to customer service.  How do people get good service?
B00H93NJLS|5|This is a great deal. The bottle is huge compared to most bottles of Argan oil you find in the market. The price is also a plus. The oil itself is good quality.
B001DKVBJU|5|Better than expected
B00QSE7J5G|5|Perfect!<br />I got 2 wraps. Brown and Black<br />Came through to my mail box.<br />It took longer than expected but worth the wait!
B006L21PQY|5|This conditioner, along with the \\"Color Me Happy\\" shampoo, is an amazing product. It left my hair incredibly soft, and it smells nice. My hair feels like when you come home from the salon, it's so soft!
B0006Q01EI|3|As the title of this review states, it's good for travel so you don't need to pack a big diffuser.  Do not expect to get the same performance out of this hot sock as you would a diffuser.
B00I9KPBTS|5|Put at base of spine, to align, I feel, so much better now, can't believe how well it works!
B000UBT6QS|1|At first I was pleased when i turned it on, I was okay for 1 min, then it stopped working, it become slow then it did nothing. It is poorly made.  They need to improve this product. It doesnt even deserve one star. I had to put it for AMAZON.
B006FRLU42|5|item shown is exactly as described on website. thank you
B007X96YXS|5|This was about 5 pounds of raw shea butter.  Just cut off a chunk, warm it up with a double boiler and put in smaller containers for use.  I like to add jojoba oil and then add a fragrance oil to it to smell nice.
B005IHECV8|1|This product is a lemon. It failed right out of the box. Drill bits didn't fit into drill making product useless and unworkable.
B009UO65RY|1|It's a joke! I received a dried up mascara that actual hurt my eyelids while I tried it on
B00150LT40|5|Love this.  Makes my weak, thin nails look great.  Provides a salon like glossy finish to my nails.  Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!
B00ESJUWXE|1|This product stopped working within 2 months of having the product.  I do not use a curling iron every day.  I am unhappy with this product.
B006306BMW|5|I bought this product on my trip to curaçao n it is amazing Hv ur skin feeling soft n smooth baby fresh I just love it
B001MCBWQ6|5|My wife loves this perfume!! Was very hard to find until it was suggested to try amazon. Glad that I listened.
B0086VI9TE|2|Excellent product but over priced...can find them cheaper other places
B001FWXHMU|5|Good price on a nice selection of perfume.  Shipped in good package to tprevent breakage.  Would recomment to any one.
B0009R35H4|5|Came ahead of time & this color is not drying to the hair at all
B00C7UF0PG|5|My dughter got this for something, don't know what, but she said it worked well. Guess that is all need be said.
B0012IXO4I|3|It'd OK but I was expecting more of an eye cream.  It is designed to lighten the area under your eyes.
B0036DAIC8|5|I've been using this product for years to shave my legs and arms.  It's think and creamy when applied and makes razor shaving a snap.  Plus, it's cruelty free - that is no animal testing for the product or any of the ingredients used in it.  The Body Shop is well known for it's cruelty free products.  I don't like all of their products but this is one of the great ones.  Oh, and it lasts almost forever!
B00KWTYYWE|5|After using this moisturizer my skin, it doesn't look tired or dull. My skin has become smoother, brighter and more tone, making my skin look youthful. I love the way it feels when applied to my skin, non greasy but keeps hydrated throughout the day.
B00006ANDK|5|They last ages and the electric toothbrush these refills belong to, last for years, and are still going!! How much can you say about refills? Lol!
B000XYX104|5|I love this makeup.  It goes on easily and stays and stays.  Not pancakey and the powder is light but has good coverage.  This is a great price for this makeup too.
B00ODU6O1W|4|Nice wig, fits well, very good for the price!
B00B5S7C8Y|5|I love this product, unfortunately it's been discontinued.
B00AREI5KG|5|This a great inexpensive dry shampoo.  I tried a few others and really like this one. I find it does best if I spray it the night before and sleep in it. In the morning my hair is as light as the first day. Also I am super blonde so if I am between touch ups I spray a little e trap around my hairline to cover my regrowth.  I have even sprayed it in my toddlers hair. She has super fine hair and it can help keep her hair tighter in a pony or with a bow.
B002RX4FAY|5|This is the best sponge ever made! The soap is like never ending, lots of bubbles and suds.your kid will have a blast with this instead of a loofa!definitely buyin another.
B009MY0IJ8|4|Pros:<br />- I LOVE the color, it's like a light pink disco ball.  It's so vibrant, plus the shine from the top coat makes it sparkle even more.<br />- The strips are very easy to use.  Gel polish is normally pretty easy, but the strips are even easier.  It took me about 5 minutes total (with distractions) to do all 10 nails myself.  Though I will say, I have the Sensationail UV lamp so I can do 4 fingers at once and both thumbs at once.<br />- The strips come with a cuticle stick and tiny nail file<br />- Also comes with it's own top coat that seems pretty thick and durable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You only get 16 strips (8 sizes, you get 2 of each), so it's expensive for only one full manicure.  You can get more manicures out of the gel polish bottles and they cost less.<br />- This listing is about $16, but Target currently has these for about $13.  Still expensive though, in my opinion.
B000GQ1WRI|1|I have been using this product for years, from various sellers.  Today the package arrived with visible stains to the outside of the bag, and a squishing sensation as I picked it up.  Sure enough, the bottle had leaked, but not from the top.  The bottom of the bottle had cracked, and half of the product had leaked into the packing peanuts.  When I tried to salvage some of it into another container, the bottle cracked in many places in my hands.  The product smelled different, and was not the usual green color.  It is evident that this product was VERY OLD.  So old in fact, that the plastic of the bottle had deteriorated.  I picture it having sat in the hot sun at a desert flea market for years. Still waiting to hear about replacement, as a return is not possible, unless they want me to send the whole thing in the garbage bag that now contains it.
B00GBC0JVG|5|Used for essential oils and works great.
B0050QF5RW|5|i love it
B001ET7752|5|I love this shower gel. I bought it for myself since I have dry skin and then my husband tried it because it had a pleasant scent and now he loves it! He immediately threw away his other moisturizing shower gels and began using this product (I did the same). When I purchased it I got it because it was cheaper than other moisturizing products and I wanted to try it. It is great, I used to have an Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion in every room in the house, I no longer need to do so. I would definitely recommend this product.
B0009QZYOC|5|Love love love it! I have waist length locs. Normally my hair doesn't take color (not even at the salon), but this does! I've been using this brand/color for the last 3 years approximately. Everyone is always asking who did it and how can they get the same results. I'd definitely suggest doing a strand test. For me I need to leave the product on for 40-45 minutes and 30 minutes on my eyebrows (for a natural look....box suggests not to, but using a q-tip there's no problem). The conditioner is amazing! Leaves your hair soft & silky, however with locs I wouldn't recommend using. Found out the hard way after a year of use I was taking too good of care for hair that technically shouldn't be...lol. So now I just shampoo & use my leave-in. My natural color is dark brown and the color on the box is what you get. I even used the jet black & 6 months later went back to red with no problem nor bleaching. Co-workers were in disbelief.
B0009OAIQ8|3|it was a little different
B00JJC5GLI|5|the item was delivered as promised as scheduled. great bday gift for moms and women.
B001DBKC1W|5|i was pleasantly surprised well for starters i did not expect to actually like this product and think it does make a slight difference in overall appearance of one's eye; it truly does i am astounded because there are thousand of eye products that makes empty promises yet they never deliver now if you are expecting a miracle overnight this is not for you however if one seems improvement over a short period of time then this is your product
B0009EILKS|4|Very useful. Arrived on time!
B008G32NL2|1|Did not work , would not recommend it  i feel i waisted my hard earned money.  Never again will i fall for this hype
B0079R6BD2|3|i found this shampoo in the internet.<br />i did searh because my hair start fall of.<br />this shampoo it's work but not as i thot
B00OP0R5DG|5|Everything came as expected.
B0047A6WLA|5|I would consider myself a novice shaving with this type of razor. Just as long as you let the blade to the work you will be just fine. Very close shave and on my first time I only got one nick due to carelessness. Never the less just as long as you pay close attention and not try to rush things this razor will give you the best shave you have ever gotten. I used the Derby razor it came with. I also have a Merkur 180 and Feather DE and this by far gave me the best shave. It might not be a fair comparison since this is an open comb but regardless, this is the razor for me.<br /><br />For the best combination on this razor I like to use it with the Astra razors! I can do 3 passes without any irritation and BA shave.
B004D7J4R6|4|Really liked it too bad they discontinued it.
B0076J9RZW|5|Have you noticed how bars of soaps are getting smaller?  Well, not Ivory!  These are nice, big bars that smell great and lather up nicely in the shower.  I love ivory for myself and kids.  No heavy perfume smell, just smells great and does the trick at a great price.
B003XDVERE|5|I love this type of dental tape and was so very glad to find it in bulk since I can rarely find it in stores anymore. Arrived smoothly without problems.
B00F56429Y|5|great daughter loves em'
B00CFZJN2Y|4|First, I'd like to start off by saying that I don't have a thick beard, so I can't say that I did a good job of stress testing the razor.<br /><br />Next, I'd like to say that the razor does work well.  It's a very comfortable shave and the cooling mechanism works noticeably well.  Granted, I can shave without it and experience no irritation, but it does feel better to have it on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the performance.  For my first shave, I let my beard grow as long as I normally do for about a week.  It doesn't grow very fast.  While it did cut most of the hairs, it did leave a few stubborn hairs that were laying down. I tried moving it around to try to pick up the hairs, but it didn't work.<br /><br />I tried it couple more times and it worked better with the hairs pretty short.  It works fast, but it doesn't get all of the hairs by the back of my jawline.  Everywhere else, it shaves very close.  For some reason, even when I stretch the skin, I still have some stubble left in those spots.<br /><br />Outside of the performance, the equipment appears to be well constructed, including the carrying case.  I even tried the cleaning system and it looks like it worked well.  Overall, I'd have to say that if electric razors work well for you, this is a good razor to try.
B002BAOMAG|2|I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately I was not a fan of the smell. It actually reminds me of BO. Also, I don't believe it was very effective. Around midday, it would start wearing off, and I don't usually need heavy strength or anything unusual. I used it a few times, and will probably get rid of it, maybe the other LAVANILA scents are better?
B0000ZRLJ8|5|Favorite smell
B0098I9RL8|5|I love the varied sizes and how each is a different color for easy identification. The quality is fair given the low price. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B000FIZB0G|5|I have very dry and very sensitive skin. Most facial washes are too rough on my skin and I've read that using a foaming facial wash is less abrasive. This stuff does wonders for my skin! After a few uses, my face has a nice glow and my skin doesn't feel tight like it usually does with other washes. I'll definitely be purchasing this again.
B002DOO1VA|5|These brushes are amazing...as are all of SHANY's brushes! These are super soft and there is virtually every brush you could ever need/want!! No shedding which is huge when you want good results!!
B00UPDMR2Q|4|Good product. Refreshing to the skin
B005DBPGOQ|1|I have been use befor for 3year.<br />But this is diffrent . My feel...and my hair...scalp is not working. Itch&oily..
B00B471ZCA|3|As described.
B006IW15HG|5|I received this product yesterday.  Color was perfect to what Mac Estheticians had matched me for.  I will order again.
B00GF1NZLY|5|Awesome service!  Just learning about the many uses and hope to be able to speak to the effectiveness of the product soon!
B00GKLEQH6|1|rip off !
B004UQ6Q62|1|When it's not tugging on hairs, it's missing them entirely. This shaver can't decide if it wants to cut so short you get razor burn or leave you looking like someone with a last name of &#34;Scruffins&#34;. I have no idea why the reviews are so high for this shaver.<br /><br />I've tried wet shaves with and without shaving cream; multiple types of shaving cream; and even dry shaves. The worst shaver/razor I have ever used. If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I gave it the full six weeks they recommend and my skin hasn't &#34;adapted&#34; and I can no longer return it, convenient of them to recommend such a long introductory period.
B003AXUYB4|1|I am sorry to say that this is the worst product I've ever bought.  I often use Maybelline products but went wrong when choosing this one for just the color. And the lasting lenght is not correct -it is even less that standard ones. I bought this product from another store and paid 10 times more. Do not recommend it at all!
B00L2MFLPO|4|Like this, not strong on exfoliating but it's good and easy to reuse.
B008RODQFM|5|I have one at home and one at school.
B00CDGR29G|5|I love this set, the images are all so pretty and there doesn't seem to be any defects/problems that actually affect the stamp (though there was some discoloration on a few plates). I haven't tried out all of the images, but the ones that I have tried have all been easy to use and stamp.
B008ML1M06|4|I bought this little guy because it's so charming and the price was right. Everytime I pop this guy out of my purse to use I always get a  a compliment or two. I gave only 4 stars because of the location of the model #, it's right next the decoration on the face. Oh and yes it does smell lovely.
B00NY5NGPE|5|Awesome serum, its just gets absorbed in the skin and you can see the results the product claims, highly recomended
B0029F2HRI|5|Purchased the body lotion and bath gel and love the fragrance.  It's not over powering and has a nice clean, fresh smell that I absolutely love!  Both the lotion and the shower gel are great and have gotten numerous complements on the scent.  Would definitely purchase again.
B0001Y74WM|5|Excellent conditioner - my hair is healthier and my curls look much better
B004N2EYY4|1|I bought this item and I was excited since I always look at the reviews, I gave it a chance and to my surprise it didn't work!! i opened the box and figured out how to assemble the drills since there were no directions in the box. After that I plugged it in and smoke came out of the power box! It's unsafe I was scared it mite explode because it was burning hot. Not to mention the drill never actually worked.  I spend like $20 for nothing! I'm very dissapointed in Amazon allowing this seller to continue selling un safe products that do not work.  please don't buy this item or from this seller  MelodySusie Nail Art!!!! I don't and will NEVER rebuy or recommend this To anyone!!!! Save yourself a headache....
B00ANIHSIG|4|I love the weight of it. Nothing else need to be said about this product. I deeply enjoy it. Thanks
B000I5HJ2Y|5|My Favourite way to blend my face with liquid foundation.
B007GM1CBQ|5|This BB cream is amazing. it has amazing coverage and makes your skin look natural. i like that it covers my imperfections so there is no need to use concealer. I will definitely repurchase it.
B00I073WLE|4|My skin has never felt so smooth. It definitely takes a free days to see a difference but my skin felt smoother as soon as I put this cream on. I can visibly see my skin tone improve although I am still waiting to see if it lightens some dark spots on my skin.
B0077LAJT2|5|Really sharp blades on the first use. I usually can hear stubble being cut with most blades, but on the first use with these the razor just glides without a sound. I can get four or five shaves with these.
B006GTKSHY|5|LOVEEEEE!!! this is my current obsession . Im so happy with this purchase ! Its a must have in my honest opinion
B0042MQC6S|1|Terrible product.    Does not work, and gives off a ridiculous sequence of beeps and lights.    Cheap knock off.  Buy the Zeno and be done with it, even the battery powered version is 100x superior to this item.
B002D4J3VI|5|Works great
B00TSTZQEY|5|I believe it helps me to sleep better
B007GZIWHU|5|This Remington shaver provides as good or better shave than the Norelco shavers which cost twice as much. This is my second Remington shaver since the other, after five years of service, simply wore out. Once I switched to the Remington, I realized that I was paying too much for a Norelco shaver that didn't provide any better shave.
B003V37ZDS|4|This razor is not bad. I have only used the cheaper electric razors in the past, including the $50 Norelco triple head shavers and those $10-$20 Remington shavers. I have never been impressed with those as the screens wear out quickly leading to a lot of cuts and irritation.  I have never used the most expensive electric shavers so I could not compare this product to those, however I have used this product for about 4 months and find it very satisfactory.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-This razor is water resistant. It can be used in the shower with soap or a gel or foam for lather. In a pinch you can use it with just water but having a gell or foam really makes for less irritation.<br />-You can use it dry and because of the battery it is cordless meaning you can use it in your car or on a bus or train or something.<br />-It is relatively quiet. It doesn't sound like you are tattooing your face each time you use it.<br />-Battery life is pretty good on this. I charge it probably once every two weeks or less depending on how much its used. Also it charges very fast. If the battery is low or dead you can give it a charge for a few mins that will get you through at least one shave.<br />-Super easy cleanup. 99% of the shaved hairs stay inside the well under the cutting heads and can be flushed away in seconds if shaving in the shower it cleans as you shave but rinse when you are done anyway.<br />-Blade life is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Minor irritation, however this is to be expected when shaving.<br />-Like all electrics it will never cut as close as a safety razor but it will get pretty damned close to it.<br />-Some spots like directly under the jaw bone it seems to have a lot of difficulty in cutting and the skin must be pulled tightly and the razor passed over several times. typically i use a gillete mach 3 to touch up any areas missed.<br />-In some spots if the skin is especially soft it will not cut the hair, no matter how many times you pass the cutting heads over. in those spots if needed you can whip out a safety razor and knock it out in about 2 seconds.<br />-Charging must be done on the base you cannot connect the cord directly ( assume this helps keep it water resistant)<br /><br />A few notes. Don't waste your money on the version with a cleaning kit. Totally unneccesary. You can rinse it off after each use and the blades have low friction coatings so nothign is sticking and the cleaning stuff is just a waste of money for a nifty but useless gadget. The carrying case works fine but will not hold the charging cord so shove the cord in a bag or something you won't need it often anyway.
B007QBE64M|5|I love the color
B001D9C262|5|GREAT STUFF! I was on a medication that broke my face out and left scarring this stuff not only corrected the acne and scarring, but made me look a few years younger! My makeup goes on much smoother now and no wrinkles. I am 41 and people think I am in my 20's . Arcona products are amazing.
B001UHOUQC|5|I love these blades but do wish they weren't quite so expensive.  I have never actually timed how long they last but it is costly to replace them.  I resorted to E-Bay to try and save a little money.  They are great to use and I no longer cut my poor legs when shaving!
B0033PSM6S|5|Love it so much I finally wear make-up every single day! Great coverage and helped tremendously with my acne and shine.<br />I will say that I am extremely oily an the color after about 4 hrs turns a bit orange even though I ordered Ivory. But I just swipe it off with a makeup cloth and redo it. Simple. I even set it up for auto delivery!!
B00ILB5VYA|5|Excellent 🙋🏻🙆🏻
B00P4QKC6M|1|Really cheap material, i bought better from here before for the same price.
B009DU4QYE|5|I have oily hair and I used to have to wash my hair everyday just in order to keep it looking clean. I started using baking soda with apple cider vinegar, because I wanted to go chemical free and I had a few friends who suggested it to me. The baking soda worked well in keeping my hair looking clean for a couple for days in a row without having to wash it again. But shortly after switching over, I noticed my hair started to look dried out and I had some damaged spots.<br /><br />I received some Degrease Shampoo as a gift and as soon as I started using it I noticed a difference. My hair felt soft after the first use and I can go four or five day without washing it again. That's probably my favorite part about this product! It is so nice to not have to wash my hair everyday. And because you only need about a quarter sized amount per washing, the bottle lasts me for quite a while.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who has oily hair and has struggled with what to use or how to wash it. I am amazed at the difference I've see in my own experience and would hope that it works just as well for others.
B0046KHE1S|2|The smell is great. The conditioner works well to detangle. You don't need a ton of product to do the job. After using for 5 mos, we got the lice AGAIN. I have 5 kids. You can imagine how awesome that is.
B000HQ0L2E|5|I just tried it for the first time, and it's pretty easy. You won't get all the hair on the first pass, but subsequent tries finished the job. I'm sure this will improve with future uses.
B007JZ3VFA|5|Quality is excellent but costs twice more that I originally payed in the store few month ago. Very small size
B00FGOFQY0|5|love love this scarf! Got so many compliments!
B002JK6VDO|5|It is easy to use.But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear. The colors are great.
B00NP9DWUS|3|First, this is not a cream, but a gel, so I don't know why it's listed as a cream. Scent is subtle and application is fine but a little sticky. I got this a while ago and used it for a few weeks but saw very little, if any, change. I am in my sixties but have very few wrinkles but my main problems are bags under the eyes and slightly droopy corners. I haven't found any eye creams, including this, that helps much with either problem.
B009Q1YPVY|5|The price was great, none of them were broken, and they work well. I'm very happy :)
B003MC99O6|1|I ordered because I liked other simply smooth shampoo and conditioner, but these left my hair looking stringy and flat.
B00JTY6WQ4|3|I purchased this from another site.  My biggest complaint is that although it was in a sealed package, there was a piece of hair in needles when I opened it, as well as a couple pieces of fuzz.  I was completely grossed out, but decided to soak it in alcohol like people were recommending and went ahead and used it.  Is that gross?  I haven't died or broken out in anything crazy, so I guess it ended up okay.  It still creeps me out a little.  But besides that, this is an interesting concept.  It doesn't hurt, but takes little getting used to.  I'm still scared that I'm going to poke my eye out sometimes.  I haven't seen any visible changes yet, but maybe I need to keep using it. I'll keep at it and hope to be glowing by summer! LOL!
B00I985ULO|5|I love this lashes so much! Arrived way before it said they would!
B00B2B2VGW|5|So far I really like this shampoo, but I've only been using it for two days. It does give my hair more texture. I like the smell, and love that all of the ingredients are natural and recognizable. It doesn't foam, so it's hard to tell if you have the right amount, but I don't mind it not foaming. It lends credibility to the fact that it's all natural herbs and oils. I have not seen growth yet, but there has not been enough time. I', also using it in conjunction with the pills. Kind of expensive, but if I can get results naturally, it's worth every penny. Certainly can't hurt.
B00BS82JYS|5|Better than getting burned with hot wax, and leaves your face feeling soft and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.  Pay less and get more!
B00LPOE9ZM|4|Bought this for a gift for my mom and she likes it.  Only thing she mentioned is that you can't use the side volume buttons
B00DXF8ENY|4|Material is not quite a nice as I was hoping, but will fill the bill for my needs.
B001QH8YI6|4|I started using Baltar back in the 70's(coal tar solution) since it is no longer available I started using NeoStrata Psorent and am very pleased with it easy to apply and it gets the job done.
B000SSDTTI|5|I bought this to replace an old razor cutting comb I have had for years, but can no longer buy the odd size razor blades to fit it.  I like this one very much.  It is easy to use, and does the job well........and uses ordinary blades too.
B00872IZE6|5|This is the real deal. I know some reviews commented that the product seemed diluted. My Nemat fragrance did not. The smell is like nothing else. It will last all day and night. Has a strong musky, earthy smell. Definite must!
B0012HCCNI|4|I love the Weleda deodorants, they are the best I can find out without aluminum (I've tried about 20 brands). However this scent is a little stronger than the sage and smells a little too much like my grandmother. It would be a bit better with jasmine or something to off set it.
B00ESZVK8E|5|Purchased this for my daughter thinking it's a kids perfume but I love it too.<br />It's not too heavy / floral and lasts through the day.<br />I may have to make an additional purchase since she knows that I'm sneaking sprays.
B002RBF1PO|3|too small, handle needs to be longer.
B007AS62J8|5|I bought this after my eye surgery because I couldn't get my face wet so this was perfect. I love this brand because I have sensitive skin and this doesn't make my skin peel.
B005VSXUQM|5|This product blends nicely with Beeswax and Covonut oil.
B0023A7JF4|4|This soap smells good, feels good on my skin, and has made my skin clearer and brighter.  I've only been using it a few weeks and can tell a difference in my skin tone.  I started using it all over then started to only use it on my face.  That wasn't the best idea because now my face is lighter than my body and you can really see a difference between my neck and face.  So, I have started back using it all over.  Hopefully my body catches us to my face :)
B007HK8PQC|5|This is a beautiful color with a slight glitter.  Lasts about a week if nails are prepped well. Great price!
B006K9OQSC|5|daughter's hair has to be in a ballet bun every week for dance class. We go straight from school so not a lot of time to fussing with hair... SO easy... pony tail, slide bun thingy on the hair, roll it up, then bend around.  works GREAT!!!
B003HENCTM|4|I'm usually not big on lip gloss, but I love this shade by Trish McEvoy. It gives my fair skin a very subtle shimmer. Additionally, this gloss isn't super tacky or sticky as other glosses can be, which is a major bonus. I highly recommend it.
B00ZKLLZAI|4|I have finally found something that really works!!! In just after a few days my teeth were a few shades whiter. I loved the squeaky clean feeling of my teeth after brushing!<br />[you can trust this review - tested as part of a Shopper Army mission!]
B005QG4L5S|5|I've been using CURL MAX products since I cut my hair last December and I wanted to rock out with a short curly afro. The Super Curly Mousse gives it that thick curly body. The Curl Pudding also helps. I also love the Twisty Curly Spray for when I do a straw set. Since I was sick of perming my hair and I thought I would try the natural look. The CURL MAX products have allowed me to have wash and wear hair again. My hair is growing, and it is thicker and my afro looks really good. I get a whole lot of compliments. I use the Curl Activator Moisturizer right after I wash my hair and then the Mousse. The leave in Curl Conditioner adds some sheen and makes it stay soft. Good products. My hair feels really good! I wish the prices were a little better but they are about the same as in the stores.
B0062YT7FM|1|Too big, didn't stick well, very unnatural looking. I took them with me to a hotel room and ended up just leaving them there. A waste of my money.
B001HBHLF8|4|Arrived today, as scheduled, in a good condition. plugged it in and it worked just fine. heats up to 450 in just few seconds. I just had to take one star away because in the pictures it shows that there should be a travel case, and by reading the other reviews I can see that some people had it with the case, mine arrived without the travel case, I wish the company would send it to me, I really need that travel case.
B00PWEUNL0|5|Very affordable, rollers work great.
B007GE5I1Y|2|I thought would be good but I dsint like the texture of it face it to my sister instead but I did get the time wise cleanser and it's awesome!
B00622KU7S|5|Just exactly what I needed
B00GT0J7UE|5|Love them.  It makes my lashed look longer naturaly
B00PYK2UI6|5|I reserved my review to after 8 days of usage. This is by far the best brushing system that I have ever owned. I've been battling fine lines and pimple scars and within 8 days I've not only seen a difference but also felt a difference. The pumice does wonders for my feet and the body brush makes my shower experience even better. It feels as though the brushes get way below the skin and cleans my pores out.  I have received many compliments from strangers about how radiant my skin looks. I would recommend this product for any skin type, however if you have sensitive skin like I do, be sure to use the sensitive brush only on your face. I should mention that I was not given an incentive to write this review.
B004T3K54U|4|I LOVE LOVE this product. IT REALLY WORKS. The only dislike I have is that it doesnt make my lashes thicker.I use the serum everyday and Iam very satisified with the length of my lashes :)
B00UU3IAT0|5|Love the product !! But Not the price,<br />.
B00FW3QK04|5|awesome
B000Q3YVI8|4|I have battled eczema for years. Despite the creams that I have received from the dermatologist, this seems works just as well if not better for a non steroid cream. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from severe dry skin or skin conditions like mine. Plus it has a pleasant scent.
B00016XJ4M|5|It smells wonderful! Love it!
B00VSFAT20|3|Its pretty but its hard to keep it on my daughters head.
B000PY17PI|5|I love this product and have bought a few of them in case they are ever discontinued!
B000C1ZFBG|5|This is my fav cologne for my husband.  We used to buy it when he was stationed in California, but hard to find back home in Illinois.  Thank you for the great price!  Definitely will order again and again!
B00NC88TU0|4|OPI is a nice nail polish. This was great for the money. And having smaller sizes is great so polish doesn't thicken up if you don't use it as often as other people do.
B000H65W1E|1|I bought this hair removal system in the forlorn hope that it would actually work well to remove body hair. After reading through the instructions a few times and trying it out, I found this product to be a complete waste of time and money. I tried to remove hair using the booklet's method of light fast passes across the area in a clockwise motion. This did nothing. it removed no hair whatsoever. When I tried a more agressive approach, I found my skin to be red, irritated and downright painfull for the next three to four days. This product does not work. I dont know if the people who gave this thing five stars were bribed or what, but this product simply doesn't work.
B000W992RG|5|So pretty!! Love the color 😊
B0019D59VC|4|it got here fast and was every well make the needles didnt get stuck going in like some other brands i got. only thing i didnt like is there wasnt tubes matching all the needles they sent , got 8rl and didnt get 8 round tube tips
B00KGE0FUK|5|Nice soap, gentle, smells clean and washes well.
B001FWXFVS|5|one of my favorite scents for my husband to wear. Fresh and clean
B00Q9DWXRK|5|Worked great
B0077PLNNE|5|Too good..No pain when used on wet skin
B00HG1JMB4|5|Love it
B007AUWRWW|3|Very flimsy. I guess you get what you pay for!
B004N7DQHA|5|Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!
B00HZ7GJ38|5|Great Lashes!!!
B000141XQA|5|Omg. I am a African American female and I've this wax. This was my first time using and I was scared of how painful it would be. It wasn't that much pain to me maybe because I use the pre cleanser and oil. It was quite messy since I was my first time but I was amazed at how well the wax removed all my hair<br />Side tip: I use my bottle warmer instead of buying a wax warmer and I love it lol. It kept the wax warm and I didn't have to use the microwave.  Ladies if you gave a bottle warmer use this instead of paying for a high price wax warmer. I didn't like the wax remover, so I'm going to try something else. I hope this helps!
B00J3WDBCK|5|Bought this for my granddaughter for Xmas
B0085RZKRI|5|Exactly as described.  Works perfectly.
B005JMKFHM|3|I mean the product shipped fast. BUTTT only one gun works, and they have yet to write me back about replacing it, and the power cord that attaches to the gun broke when i was unplugging it. I am not happy with were i am right now with the product but when the new cord comes in that will change. For the money you cant beat it but i would consider looking else where first.
B006QZM3P8|5|Order was shipped and received on time. This works very well. Works effectivly!  I will gladly order it again and tell my friends.
B00K4EPT4E|5|it looks really good on me and I got a lot of compliments. very unique white color that you can not find in stores around here
B0041IQVT6|2|One of the boxes was opened.
B001E7BAG6|5|Great product good price.  Hard to find in stores
B009F5GIHK|5|Thee best perfume bottle I've ever bought! Not only does the bottle look super cool BUT it smells really good! LOVE it and would soo buy it again!
B0047PPCAW|5|I have sooooooooooo many eye creams.  This is more like a petroleum based product than a cream, but the next morning when I awaken after using Queen Bee, my wrinkles are noticably less, my skin is soft and moisturized and I never thought I would say that my dark circles seem less pronounced.  Using my concealing cream is more effective with a little of this cream first.  I just love it!  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007PUHWBS|5|Nice product
B002QA1VDW|5|This is hands down the best tanning method I have ever used. I've even cancelled my tanning membership because this makes me tan faster, is healthier, and looks completely natural. I love how easy it is to fix any mistakes the next day and how fast it dries. The best tip I've found is to use it before bed and take a light shower in the morning if you want it to be subtle. If you're hoping for a jaw dropping makeover, shower 24 hours later. Would definitely recommend to anyone hoping to add some color.
B006BESOL6|5|Love this moisturizing lotion! Makes my hair feel soft and healthy.
B0038NX4AY|1|I bought this product twice and both times it only lasted a few times before it was empty.  Not worth the money for only a few uses before you have to discard it.
B002789BAS|5|Figured I would like this product based on previous reviews and I was right! Color is super natural. Goes on very smooth and lasts for quite a while. Love the fact too that there is a SPF factor. Would highly recommend.
B006PEL7F2|1|Bought this because it was recommended by some magazine/beauty product reviewer as one of the best home wax kits for brazilian wax -- FAIL.  TERRIBLE product for bikini/brazilian wax.  Does not grip hair, leaves ingrowns and even infected follicles.  Even after multiple applications, over 60% of the hair remained unremoved -- with sticky wax stuck all over it.  I also tried it 3 times to make sure I wasn't just using it incorrectly -- 3rd time was not a charm.  Awful experience everytime.<br /><br />I've tried it on underarms as well, and it works a little better but still had the same fundamental problems.<br /><br />Nice that it is easy to apply in a thin layer with the roller applicator and that it washes off easily with water, but what use is all that if it doesn't serve its primary function to get the hair off.
B003FD8E02|1|before i used this product i never had dandruff or an itchy scalp. However, after just a single use, which was over a year ago, i did and still have to this day and everyday. this product is terrible, on the bright side, i had great smelling hair for a day. word to the wise, unless you have an iron scalp, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!.
B0009Q64E6|5|THIS IS A GOOD TOOTHBRUSH AND YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE HERE. WITH ALL THESE SICKNESSES GOING AROUND , I FIGURED I WOULD CHANGE OUT OUR TOOTHBRUSHES EVERY COUPLE MONTHS THIS WAY WE ARE GETTING RID OF THE GERMS AND NOT REINFECTING SOMEONE.
B001QY8QXM|5|Good blades and seller was quick to ship!  Would order again!!
B005HIH7YM|1|I gave this a try for six weeks, and I could kick myself for keeping with it that long. I thought it would be a cheap alternative to Wen, but it's just awful. It's like putting lotion in your hair. It doesn't even cleanse your hair and leaves more of a greasy buildup. I have medium-thick wavy-curly hair, shoulder length. I usually used 4-6 pumps, and this made my hair oily, limp and hard to deal with. I actually had to pull at my hair so much while brushing that I've got split ends! And I've been shedding more!<br /><br />I switched to Mane n' Tail Herbal Gro hoping it'll undo the damage, and after 6 uses it's already made a big difference. But nothing will beat getting a haircut, which I plan to do soon. And I can't wait to tell my hairdresser about this.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this product!
B00T3GTBGG|5|Lightweight - brightens and conceals and perfect under make up. The applicator is soft and easy to use.  I use it on my eyelids as an eye shadow primer.  I have two - one I carry in my purse for touch ups on the go.  Highly recommend.
B000JLEY66|5|Burberry Brit to me is the best of the Burberry Men's fragrances thus far.  It is my favorite fragrance to buy my husband.  It is not too strong and it really smells great.
B00649VMVC|5|great
B005RT9GPE|1|I'm a 40 year old male and after using 2 of the 4 bottles I saw absolutely no difference so I returned the other 2 for a partial refund.
B000C1UD4K|5|After fifteen years I finally converted to another cologne. I guess I just finally felt it was time to move past my high school years. It still smells amazing, but I wanted something complex. I went to one of those perfume stores and discovered Givenchy play sport. It smells amazing and lasts all day. I will miss you happy, but we had some good times together. I hope you bring as many wonderful memories and hide many body smells for another generation of young people. You shall be missed.
B00F1ATLLS|2|Texture and condition is great, the color however has a lot of purple in it.  It is very bright I have to add another more subdue one on top of it.  Being so bright it does last a long time as the staining properties must be over the top.
B00017OV9S|5|I chose the rating because Thayers Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera Original did everything it said it would do: cleanse, tighten pores, refresh my skin.<br />It has no weird ingredients. It has organic substances, natural fragrance, etc.
B009I6H03W|5|yes, exactly as ordered. I only wish there were larger sizes for purchase
B00O3ILA5Y|3|I've used this a couple times and haven't seen any improvement so far. I'm giving it 3 stars though because I love the way it feels once on. Its silky and you can really feel it penetrating. I'm hoping that it does help within a couple weeks or so. But  it isn't bad but isn't great.
B00L5PCACK|5|needed them very good serves
B0001EL7H0|4|Works as expected.  Not harsh or irritating.
B0084HM1DA|5|All gone, thank God hubby bought me a big bottle, favorite scent!
B00LYLJJO2|5|The best tweezers I've ever owned. The sharp pair is almost needle sharp, and they really are perfectly aligned and grab hairs so easily.  Wish I had gotten these sooner.
B00DPE9EQO|3|Trademark is not placed in fine line, make me wonder is that really comes from professional manufactory?
B0012021FY|5|Easy to use and only requires a very small amount. No overbearing smell and not sticky. My clients love the way it makes their skin feel.
B000NDW8TU|5|I have tried a lot of products to help my German Shepherd with itching and his chewing which is allergy related.  This product improved his coat, hair regrowth.  He was not crazy about taste, but the product definitely improved his issue within first two weeks!  I would recommend this product to anyone.   My dog usually inhales his food until this product was sprinkled on food, recommend mixing wet.  Results speak for themselves, this product worked for us no doubt, less itching, hair grew back and shedding is minimal!  Cant say enough on this, great product!
B000X2DMEG|5|It holds well, and remolds easily when my hair gets messed up. Leaves hair extremely soft when washed out.
B0096LTGEU|5|Citronella is a great product for my needs.  Highly recommend.
B000W6TF6W|1|Doesn't work.
B009AFINSW|5|Excellent product.  Lasts a long time.
B000MGSJEG|2|I purchased this and it is supposed to be 100% but I can tell by the consistency and the way that it EVAPORATES (oil does not evaporate into thin air)  that this has been diluted with some kind of alcohol :(    it is much thinner/watery than the product you'd buy in a store.    It also doesn't smell as potent as store-bought thyme essential oil :(    I was so excited to find cheaper oils here, but they are just that- cheap :(
B00684ENC8|1|This item came to me busted with the product everywhere
B002WYZ4TY|5|just what I was looking for.
B00819JRNS|5|I am practically kicking myself for paying around $30 for an Anastasia brow pencil when this thing existed all along. My Anastasia pencil broke broke into chunks after accidentally dropping onto the ground from a short height. This one stayed solid after dropping it on PURPOSE from a higher height. And how can you beat this price? You can't! Just order far enough in advance because it can take a while to get to you. Completely worth the wait. I have both the brown and dark grey versions of this pencil and use it daily. You can layer up for a more intense look if you'd like. Will be ordering these again and again.
B00PYK2UI6|5|Love this gentle brush for my face and the body brush is perfect! Thanks
B00MBXVE1I|5|This is a very good product. The serum is easy to apply and feels so lightweight on skin doesnt clog up my pores nor leaves it sticky nor gunky what it does is smooth out my dry skin and leave it with a healthy younger looking appearance. I recommend it.
B000KOOA5W|5|Order arrived in good condition and was exactly per my order.  This product has apparently been discontinued by L'Oreal, and it is nice to have it available through Amazon.  I cannot imagine why this excellent product has been discontinued.
B001D5599I|5|I have been using this THIS Joop Cologne for over 15 years. A cologne can only be properly judged by putting it on your skin, waiting for it to interact with your body chemistry and THEN seeing what it smells like. I have always had compliments from women in their twenties, thirties, forties, you get the picture. I have tried many other colognes, and none come even close to this one. Most women use perfumes which agree with them, but the same definitely does not hold true with men. You want something that suggests &#34;classy, intelligent and interesting&#34;? Then this is the ticket.
B000BIVY2Y|5|Just what my hair and scalp needed.  I will reorder it.  Also it smells good and does not require that much.
B00AQX87M4|1|This stuff DOES NOT SINK INTO YOUR SKIN. They say you should use it as your final step. Eww! There is NO WAY you could appy powder foundation or blush (that so many of us shiney girls use) to this, w/o gunking up your brushes. And if you are in the north and need to bundle up with a scarf or hat or high necked coat near your face, you can expect to be scrubbing this gunk out of everything you own. What on earth were they thinking?
B000GCUC96|3|I'm riding the fence on this one...I LOVE how subtle the highlighting is - very natural looking, BUT it seems to weaken quickly. The areas I put it on first do lighten, but after the initial first few minutes, the areas I add it to, do nothing. I put a LOT on, too and the first time I was concerned I had overdone it, but when I rinsed it off, was surprised at there hardly being much lightening.
B00O84208Y|5|I already own a different cleansing device that claims to be &#34;sonic&#34;, I was happy with it until I tried the Silk'n Soniccleanplus Deep Cleansing Device.  The Silk'n Soniccleanplus is really in a category all it's own!  It was fully charged right out of the box which I appreciate.  The cleansing brushes that came with it are really wonderful!  I have extremely sensitive skin, with patches of eczema, and this brush wasn't irritating at all.  It felt soothing and comfortable the entire time I used it.  I used it on the right side of my face first just to compare and I was shocked at the difference!  After only one use the skin on the right side of my face was drastically smoother.  I used it all over my face and neck and when I got out of the shower my skin was positively glowing.  I am just so impressed with how wonderful my skin looks after using this product!  I love that it doesn't require batteries and charges in it's own docking station.  It also says it is a sonic cleaner right on the back of it.  This is probably TMI, but when I left my other facial cleanser out on the countertop in the bathroom one of my friends thought it was an intimate massager.  We had a great laugh about it, but it may not be so cute if your motherinlaw or neighbor thought the same thing and didn't mention it to you so you could clear up the situation.  If I had to be super picky I would like the other two heads to nest in the back of the base so they didn't have to be stored separately.  Not a big deal but it is the only negative I can think of.
B0012UFFEI|5|I didn't order this from Amazon, but I bought it from the Asian mart near me. I've used American products for years and none of them were able to get rid of my blackheads, both drugstore and expensive brands. I purchased this since Asian beauty supplies have been a godsend and within days, and I mean literally DAYS, the blackheads from my cheeks were GONE! The ones on my nose are a bit deeper and more difficult to remove, but they're also slowly fading away!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for anyone battling blackheads. It's pretty strong, so don't use it daily.
B003KJBK3E|5|I am thrilled I discovered these toothbrushes!  My 5 year old and 2 year old kids use them and they are perfect -- great colors, just the right size, and durable.  The fact that they are made in the USA and the environmental benefits are a huge bonus.
B000R830IE|5|ok
B00OPCHAB6|5|I just tried this dead sea mask this past weekend and I am in love! It works extremely well, my face felt absolutely amazing after I used. This is now my go to mask that I will use from now on!
B00MFX4B3C|5|What can I say about this Organizer... I absolutely love this. I use this for my bathroom essentials. All of my face products I use this for. But you can use it for anything.
B00BE6TOEC|5|wonderful fragrance that is difficult to find--glad I was able to secure a bottle before it disappears. Great price as well
B007THLNAS|5|Excellent product and would highly recommend it.
B00ANG7AJK|5|sets all your makeup needs especially troll makeup !
B00726E5CO|5|Very pleasant and responsive proprietor.  Product received was extremely fresh and arrived in perfect condition from the source across the Atlantic.  One of my personal all-time favorites used in my preshave routine over many years, now available to me at a much better price!
B0085ZMO8I|5|I have been using (addicted) to this product for years! It is the most soothing cure for dry cracked skin and an awesome home remedy for just about anything...I always have one in my medicine cabinet.  But my real addiction is using it as a lip balm and always have one in my purse too!  Applying once in the morning is enough...it is so rich and moisturizing that you don't need to keep reapplying it...it will last forever!
B000VHFSWW|5|I use it every day. First time using it. It does what it says it will do. Thank you again.
B000P8FNGS|4|Really nice and masculine fragrance. Gets tons of compliments. Holds long, not overpowering. I would recommend purchasing to any man wanting a unique style of smelling different from the rest.
B0013BW724|5|This is the single best nail product I have ever used! I don't understand how it works but it is AWESOME! I have very fine and brittle nails and this has helped condition the nail bed as well as the cuticle!  Actually, I ordered some of this companies other products and they are very nice, also!
B003VDGIQI|1|I did not purchase this though amazon,  but i did want to write a review.  Im not sure how the other reviews are so high. I did a french manicure yesterday, used this as the top coat and today it is peeling off. I do wash my hands &#34;alot&#34; due to working in a public building and then add lotion, and my left hand has completely peeled away leaving the french manicure &#34;white&#34; portion. I have to say that it does not hold up to my expectations. Sorry Sally not a good product for a frequent hand washer.<br /><br />The plus is the shine was great for the short time that it lasted.
B00A0IWRU8|3|I have heard a lot about the Moroccan oils for hair, but have found the products for using pre/post styling to be too heavy for my hair. I thought this conditioner might be a good option instead.  I noticed immediately that my hair felt a bit \\"gunky\\" when I would blow dry it.  I have very coarse/thick hair so I don't like to wash it everyday.  I'm afraid with this conditioner my hair looked great the first day, but greasy the next.  If you wash everyday, perhaps this conditioner would work for you, but probably not if you have fine hair.  I still keep this conditioner in my shower, I just use it once in a while in the rotation of conditioners.  I also recommending adding extra rinsing time when using it.  It has a nice fragrance, too.
B00A7L30JK|3|Bought the samples to see about the product, didnt notice results, believe the price is too high, its just any other skin care product you have to take a chance
B00011JOSM|5|What can I say about a brush?  I've had one like this for years and it finally wore out.  I couldn't believe I found the same brush at Amazon.  I can't tell you why I love it so much, it just seems to work better than other brushes.  The bristles are sturdy, but not hard and it feels good on the scalp when I'm using it.
B00LCXS80S|3|My husband has a bit of a problem in that he has no sense of smell but wants shampoos and soaps that don't smell girly.  So when this popped up in Vine, I figured it was worth a shot.  I opened it to smell it and... mixed feelings.  It's definitely way batter than any of those drug store products that are touted as being so manly the women will crawling all over you.  Those stink.  This manages to smell more like a traditional man scent than those without giving me the migraine that those do.  BUT, the scent is rather strong and takes a little longer than some to dissipate.  That aspect I am not very fond of.  If the scent smelled the same straight out of the bottle as it does about an hour after putting it on, it'd be perfect.  Until that hour or so has passed, it's just too strong for me to be close to it.
B00G1RMS6U|5|Great color that is hard to find. Thank you for having this dark green.  Just what I needed for comic con this weekend. Thank you!
B00RJPHQL0|5|I was reluctant to get blonde, they are usually cheesy and look fake, I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE. I am so pleased I got the three pack as well, they are think and a beautiful shade. They also come with replacement clips, sewing materials, and a cute bracelet/hair tie with a thank you note. Will definitely buy from this seller again.
B0051E36HY|5|I thought I would try a different brand because the price was good<br />on this brush. It works fine it is just that I guess I am just too used<br />to using the Spornette brushes.
B007RF1YZG|5|I don't smoke but do drink coffee (with cream) and my teeth are a good color but with all the media hype for chicklet-like teeth, I felt compelled to try whiteners.  I've tried other drugstore brands but Rembrandt is always my favorite.  They apply easily enough and whiten nicely without making your teeth look paper white -- You know what I mean.  The taste isn't bad either.
B002MXFNVE|5|Awesome product, truly without a fragrance. Great for summer when any fragrance seems cloying in the heat.<br /><br />Very easy to use. I use it to hold my short hair in a side part - sort of a Mad Men style. Works great. Best hair goop I've used so far. Get it.
B0009OAHKK|5|Excelente!
B00QPPM8M2|4|This is a knockoff Gelish Polish. I honestly thought I was buying a Gelish Polish but realized it wasn't after placing my order, but for $6.99 I thought I'd let it go through and try it. It's a decent polish that's worth it's price considering you get quite a lot compared to the Gelish minis they sell at Sally's beauty supply. It took three coats of this to get good coverage with her his color. I'm not sure if that would be the case with other colors. It is thinner than the Gelish brand polish, which I find easier to work with. I also found the color to be tamer that what is shown in the picture, which actually I actually like. It may be my favorite feminine pink. I'll buy a few more colors, but since it comes from China it will take a while to get it. It took about a month and a half to get it. I tend to change my polish every week or weeks and a half so I can't speak on longevity. If it ends up being terrible I'll update this post.
B003VMOZE6|4|While this is a very nice green color, I gave it 4 stars because the color is not as it appears on the site.  It is definitely more of an emerald green in my opinion
B005NORBIW|5|I love this whip. I love all of  the Aveda products. The whip is just right for my long fine hair. It doesn't come out as hard as a brick.<br />It is strong enough to hold my fine hair. I would definitely buy this styling whip again and again.
B009ZFVMBW|4|For several years, I have been purchasing this shampoo directly from the company. It is a nice product (fragrance, cleaning ability) in terms of basic shampoo characteristics. It is impossible to tell how much it has helped because I don't have a control (identical twin).  Some dermatologists I have spoken to have expressed reservations about the ability of DHT blocking compounds to penetrate the skin.  Yet, my approach is that used over decades, there might be some benefit that would augment other treatments (minoxidil, avodart, finasteride, etc).  But again, without expensive research studies it is impossible to tell.<br /><br />One trait that some customers may not like is that the shampoo is very thin (i.e. low viscosity).  It isn't clear why this is the case.  While it still does the low viscosity may be an issue if you want to place this shampoo in other containers like wall dispensers or travel bottles.
B007P0ARXS|3|I use this as bath oil & the rose scent is so faint as to be virtually undetectable. It almost smells unscented.
B001MIZMN4|5|Such a nice body wash.  It isn't too sudsy and the smell is really nice.  I even use it for a bubble bath. It makes the bathroom smell gorgeous when I leave.  Awesome product and it doesn't dry my skin out the way other products do
B000H6A02A|4|After reading reviews both on Amazon and elsewhere, I almost did not purchase this shaver because of the reported noise levels.  I do not find it much, if any, louder than the Braun I have been using.  Does a good job shaving and I am satisfied with the quality for the cost.
B00889VG6W|4|I was a 100 percent satisfied with my purchase.  It just took longer than I had anticipated to arrive.  I got the biggest bang for my bucks with this hair piece. I recommend this hair piece to those with thinning hair in the front or people who choose not to cut their hair for bang.
B000R8SE80|2|I did not see the result this product claims after using it regularly for a month. It did not hydrate my lips or did any improvement. It acted more like a lip gloss than providing any sort of treatment. I will not repurchase this.
B00D7BUUZ4|2|i dunno if this product sat around too long, but by the time i got it....i opened it and was all ready to use it and it was dried out! :( paid like a good $11 to $12 bucks for something that didnt even work......
B008TBTA6C|3|I cut my own hair and I found the blades to be too short and dull for me. I finally found a replacement for the shears I had been using for years and purchased them instead. I didn't not return these since I would have had to pay shipping which was half the cost of the product. I will find another use for them
B000P20S9Q|4|Love the smell
B00SI5CVR4|1|7/3. Just opened the delivery box. Carefully removed the bubble wrap. My hand was saturated with scent immediately. The bottle was oily and the scent of concentrated sandalwood permeated the air. NO LABEL on the bottle. Was very careful. Want a refund.
B001CT09W2|5|Great
B00N5N5KZO|5|Had this for over 6 weeks and my wife still uses it every morning over her $300 straightener.
B009VJBILG|5|Perfect shade of pink. Your lips but better. The price is good the packaging is adorable and I would recommend this color for anyone.
B00HZ8DJ0I|3|Not as rich or moisturizing as other Olay products .
B006OZF3DY|1|canceled
B002KP1WIW|5|I was looking for a new scent and I'm so glad I found this. I was worried about buying it online because I couldn't smell it before hand, but I love the scent. It smells lovely and it's not too strong so i can wear it everyday.
B00385WMJ6|5|Finally, a shower cap that keeps your hair dry in the shower.  Will definitely buy again.
B00FOLPQ2M|3|Color was spot on but it's pretty thin. Order two if you have thick natural hair otherwise it doesn't look right. Nice length though.
B00VX17F1W|5|My daughter has very dry skin I used this oil for her arms and they began to heal within a week. It is not to heavy but it coats very will. It is better to me for night use.
B007RX2TSO|2|Stand is nice and light is fine. However, the quality of the actual mirror is very poor.
B000PARERW|5|I get how these work , they prevent the skin from moving and bunching, makes sense. I don't buy the claim that they reduce the lines already there, but the prevention overnight of letting your skin slip back into those wrinkles, and deepen them,  is good enough for me. I find it to work remarkably well, I wish it would last longer. I was hoping to stretch it beyond the 30 day suggested replacement, no such luck, even if you wash it well, it just loses its &#34;stick.&#34;<br /><br />I bought the Bellini to save some money, bad idea. In fairness, I don't believe the Bellni bill themselves to be worn overnight, the Silc Skin do. The Bellni's don't stick well and end up falling off or bunching up, I will stick with the more expensive Silc Skin.
B001S2PSRE|1|In less than 6 months after purchase, my new Oral B toothbrush developed a very short recharged battery life.  I only got 1 or 2 uses after a 24 hour recharging.  When I searched other reviews of this product, I found that I was not alone. A very unsatisfactory product that should be withdrawn from the market.
B003EMVVMM|4|I loved it because amazon applied coupon for $6.00.
B0006GK61Q|5|This is a great prop for any theater production or an addition to a costume.  This was just what my noir detective costume needed!  Looks incredibly realistic and people will mistake it for the real thing, especially from a distance.
B00520IWU8|5|I really like this scent, it's not over powering and \\"earthy\\". True to it's name a \\"heavier warm\\" smell.  I don't prefer the flowery smells and this delivers.  Also, it doesn't have that 'bug spray' smell either!  I have many complements on this perfume.  to sum it up - earthy, subtle, warm.
B00MVABJJI|5|Cute and easy to useThis little tool is mighty and well worth every penny.  It is easy to use and sturdy for those annoying ingrown nails.  I would definitely recommend this Toenail Nippers to anyone in the market.  Rest assured that this companies customer service is outstanding and you can't go wrong with it.
B001QY8QXM|5|Year 2012 has been a double edged safety razor journey for me. I have tried the following razors blades: Merkur, Feather, Astra and Derby. None of them gave me as comfortable of a shave as the Astra. Using a Merkur 23C or an EJ89 razor I get fantastic shaves with the Astra for about four shaves. I do use pre-shave oil on my face and lather shaving cream to perfection in a bowl. The only blade that I could not tolerate was the Merkur that felt like trying to shave with a wooden stick. For my hair and skin the Derby has acted more dull than the Astra, and I have tried many times. The Feathers are great in the EJ89, but have to be very careful when using it in a more agressive razor like the 23C. For the price of 10 cents a blade I am very satisfied with the Astra SP razor blades.
B000DIN39Y|4|New to this product line, and would recommend
B004WFDUII|5|Love it...usually have to drive to K.C. to get this size
B000JNQSIQ|4|Good
B004TSFEBY|5|These brushes are the bomb. Being a professional mua, I am always searching for good quality brushes that are reasonably priced. And these brushes are it. Perfect for blending out shadows and giving that airbrush look to foundation.
B001E95G5A|5|I use this once a month to maintain the proper color and avoid undyed roots showing when I style in the morning
B0009OAGXI|5|This was a Christmas gift for my great-granddaughters boyfriend.  I think it will be fine and smell just fine. It looked just as advertised.
B0095IMNI0|5|i love the clean feel of the water after i finish using it. its so easy to use and i do it 2 times a day.
B004L94X7W|5|Product is amazing and does what I expected it to do and more
B001MA0QY2|5|Love the way in which it was packaged ( glove, flat iron, straightening oil sample, cover). This product does the job and can be controlled by turning the dial which was essiential. Great purchase for the price and my hair looks and feels fantastic!
B001E5ECFE|5|I have just used Clairol 's Natural Instincts for the first time and I am thrilled with the results. the color is phenomenal. Gorgeous, natural, with tons of shine. I can't say enough about it. I have dark brown hair that hsd turned mousey with age. I have a few greys which I had been thinking might be acceptable. After using Clairol's Natural instinct's NUTMEG, I am transformed!  The results look natural,  yet glorious. Thank you Clairol. I have been dying my hair for years, yet never felt compelled to thank the creators of the dyes. Thank you, thank you, thank you,Clairol.  Loulou
B0086VI9LC|5|Feels like you just came from the dentist, every time.<br />Probably great for gum health too.
B0067F998G|4|They do the job but it's a little early to tell if they will workout long term.  So far - so good!
B001DKQ47E|3|Although it works, I like the Toplimit E12 4 Watt 350 Lumens LED Light Bulb better.  It is brighter and has a higher color temperature (closer to 4000k) along with little heat that causes the bulbs the fail in the beginning.  The LED is big, but it just barely fits into the vanity mirror.
B00KKK7PLC|5|I like this one.
B002KO903M|5|This hot pink dye clings onto your hair for dear life. I had to bleach my hair several times to get it out. Now I dilute it with conditioner to make a light/pastel pink dye. Works loads better than the cotton candy pink dye by manic panic.
B00CJ01QT8|3|I'm still using this product.  I don't know if it's any better than any other less expensive cream I've used but it's almost impossible to get out of the container.  The pump is not very good.  I've stored it upside down, shaken it, etc. but very little comes out.  Maybe it will last longer.
B0030O3VRW|5|Use it all the time, I just saw a YouTube tutorial where she used much more than me, so going to try that.
B00IFTCMUO|5|I used this mask after I removed some blackheads and whiteheads. I like how this mask makes my pores smaller and my facial skin firmer. Also, it doesn't have a strong fragrance smell like some other masks I've tried. It is a great natural mask for facial skin.
B0018BVETG|2|For as much publicity Helen of Troy hair products gets, this is a cheaply made curling iron.  Not happy or impressed.
B007WRDZ2Y|5|The right product what you see is what you get , fast deliver, it was what I was expecting for!.
B0073ZGJAA|5|I had been introduced to this product by my hair stylist and liked the results when she used KMS anti humidity spray On My hair.  I then decided to purchase on line as I could save some money vs paying retail.  Works in the humid as well as snowy winter weather.  Love the product,
B0006SFXYY|5|I have only been using it for about a little over a week but i can already see changes. I have seborrheic dermatitis and i have had way less itching and irritation and definitely less hairfall as well. I have been using it along with the scalp stimulating shampoo, citrus and neroli detangler (i have curly african american hair. 4b if anyone wants to know. The conditioner is really good) and the scalp serum. So far i love it and will definitely be repurchasing
B0067H6MC0|1|waste of money. This doesn't work. I generally like neutrogena products but I would recommend the one in the silver tube and purple lid over this one.
B001T7APMG|3|I got this believing it would thicken my hair, well not thicken but fill in thinning spaces. I did not ive been using for about 4 months and have not noticed any thickening in those thin places. Some softening has occured but i wasnt buying for that reason. I know things take time but 4 months is a long time to me to see no difference at all with filling in empty spaces. I will not continue to purchase this product.
B00GM22ZZS|5|Love the sebastian's did not receive free Liquid.
B00DIHLM8G|5|Great scent. Oil has a nice thickness. Not greasy. Lubricates my face and helps protect it during my shave.
B0062TNZ3C|2|Nice, great price.
B008DCP8I6|2|The rotating comb stops working every time I attempt to curl my eyelashes using this thing!<br />Anddd the teeth really should have been slightly elongated...
B000EM6XQY|5|I was concerned that this was going to be one of those &#34;plain brown box&#34; perfumes you find at those perfumeries that may or may not be expired and may or may not have fallen off the back of a truck.  I was very happy to find it was still factory sealed in the factor box, not expired.  it cost a lot less than going to the store, and I didn't have to wade through the clouds of 100 other perfumes to get to it.
B00AA9HIWY|4|Good to your hair and stops itchy scalp...good stuff but expensive............... Not available in any local stores.<br />You can stretch it by adding some water after you've used a portion to leave room in the bottle.
B0043DMNHS|5|I love it...
B001SNPZLW|5|I took a sample of this at Neiman Marcus and couldn't figure out why my purse smelled amazing. Perfect size for an already large perfume collection, and gorgeous, unique fragrance.
B00154RA3A|5|Great product
B00021DVDK|4|I tried other drugstore mineral foundations - neutrogena and l'oreal - and thought that if they were pretty good, then this would be even better - but I was a little disappointed that the shade I purchased was not as medium as I thought it would be.  I understand that I would probably achieve better results with the kit so that I could mix the colors in the hopes of getting closer to my skin tone.  I would recommend going to sephora and trying out the colors if you're having a difficult time deciding on a shade.
B000YA82WE|5|Great product for aging lips.  Been using it for many years.  Price on Amazon is much lower than retail.  Recommend to anyone with dry lips.
B00A3XJFLO|5|Yayyy I'm the very first to review this tanning lotion :)<br /><br />I never thought I'd say I'M TO TAN!!! But yes using this lotion has gotten wayyyyy to tan. I use to go tan 4X's a week but with this lotion I only go 2X's a week or I will literally look like I' mixed with Black! (I'm light skin Hispanic male)<br /> I've been tanning since I was 16 and I'm 19 now and during that time I have used sooo many lotions such as<br />Worship me, Tao, Aphrodisiac, Luminary, White 2 Black, Going GAGA, Sinfully Black, Paint it black, Insanely Black-Tingle, Black storm, Pure Harmony, Verture, Jwwow, Berrylicious, Sun Skin Spa, and some others I can't remember the names of but this is seriously the best lotion I've used! I don't feel the warmth on this lotion not even a little which was a bit disappointing but I don't care anymore because it works better than any painful tingles and the smell is an okay it smell very Unisex for those of you that care too much on smell I personally don't as long as it works and no ATO which is a plus. Works better than those super expensive lotions and it's also very moisturizing and non drying, I give it 5 stars and plus if possible!!! WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!!!<br />  BTW- shipping was super fast it arrived the next day to KS (Prime Member)
B001G7QYY2|5|Best gel for asian hair, hands down.  It gives a gel free look if you use very little and continue to shape your hair with your fingers.
B00ARTK95A|5|Love this toothbrush. Was delivered as promised.  Works great. Have been using an electric toothbrush for several years now but this one is the best.
B008O4YM4Y|5|Does not pull or yank hair like some other brushes have.  Would buy again!  Just wish it would go on sale again!
B00007M0CP|2|This product didn't work for me, but that's not to say it will not work for you. My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair, you only get a few clips with the product and they didn't work very well--At least they didn't work well for me. I gave this product away and even that person didn't want it. I may be a fan of some Conair products, just not this one.
B000UUQAY0|5|This product does exactly what it is suppose to do.  It took the bronze look out of our blond hair..... Love it and will definitely buy it again!
B00AW98M86|5|I love it and have always used it and will continue to use it.
B00TSPJ1AS|5|Clean my skin very well.
B008WG7X8Q|5|good
B002WTC38O|2|couldn't see much regrowth
B00PJAH2UW|5|I am seeing growth in eyebrows already. Amazing product and smells great too!
B002CVTVVY|4|My dentist recommended the Philips Sonicare FlexCare plus, Rechargeable toothbruth with the sanitizer to help keep my teeth, gums, filings, and crowns clean in order to make them last longer and stay healthy.  I really like the way my teeth have that fresh feeling after using this toothbrush that is like just leaving the dentist office.  I feel like this was a worthwhile purchase and I got a good deal by buying it on Amazon.com.  I've sent in [...] Sonicare from the dentist and hope to receive it soon which makes a good deal even better.
B00GQ9I9IO|5|I love this serum.  It is very easy to use and feels really good on your skin.  You just use a few drops and smooth it on your<br />skin - it absorbs very easily.  Not greasy.
B00CAE3SFI|3|I expected a red-brown wig with loose curls at the bottom. I received a light brown to blonde wig with very tight curls throughout most of the wig. It still looks very cute on, but I would not have purchased if I had known what it would look like ahead of time.
B0017QMJV4|5|Love. Will purchase these from now on.
B002W2N8FI|5|I love this gelled oil. I went through my first bottle really quickly so this purchase I bought two at the same time. It not only keeps bugs away in the summer but is so silky and soft on your skin all year long. And it smells so fresh and clean. The items came quickly to my house and I am very satisfied with my purchase
B0009I4MBQ|5|Great stuff! Wish I had hair so I could use it. I Ordered it for my wife.
B001FOFI0W|5|I could not find this product in the local beauty stores.  It was nice to find it online at a reasonable price.
B005KF5WYO|5|I like it like it....
B004D8JQ4G|5|A little wary about something considered &#34;already opened&#34;, but was pleasantly surprised.  Great condition!!  The recepient was thrilled!  Would order again.
B0091JL3IO|5|Great item! I live in S TX and keep it in my car, we get over 100 degree temps so my car is easily hotter! This item still works perfectly!
B00JRK55HW|5|Perfect for adults and children in painlessly removing tangles.  I have one for home, one for my travel bag, and this colorful one for my granddaughter who has long beautiful hair.  I wouldn't want to ever have to do without this brush!
B008GR4L18|2|You get what you get for the price you pay.it was way to long and tangled way to easy and wig shampoo did not help.
B00FRD8746|5|I love this color it doesn't fade
B001FWXT4Q|4|The brush works just as I expected. They last me about 6 months and since my bottom front teeth are overlapping, I need this brush to keep the area free of Plaque.
B00021DE8M|5|I purchased this lip liner in Rose, and it is a perfect natural liner! It gives you this natural, rosey, pouty color that looks like little kids' lips do. It's great under other colors, or just by itself with a little gloss on top. This is something I will definately buy again.
B001KYQ7PC|1|DO NOT BUY THESE<br />they are literally $1-$2 for a pack of 12 at walmart. It's ridiculous they're trying to charge so much.<br />Save your money.<br /><br />As for the product, cute and flavorful.
B000P20QKW|5|The only Fragrance I will wear.I cant find it in stores, and this was a great price.
B00ELSBSIU|5|Color choices are excellent.  Stays on all day.
B00O96POCK|3|It's not purple anymore and not as thick
B003UBTYKI|5|i love our oral-b battery op toothbrushes - but often had a hard time finding replacement heads in the stores.  via amazon.com, i found a resource for them that ALSO sends them to me every 3 months like clockwork - at the exact time i should be replacing them anyway - it's a win-win!!  AND, the price is lower than retail AND i get free shipping!  pinch me ... seriously, i'm just smiling brightly over the whole thing!
B0092MCO88|1|Waste of money!  After the 3rd use, the hose to the bonnet broke loose from up inside the dryer and now it's totally useless.<br /><br />Spend a few extra dollars and get a real hair dryer!
B004VWCJZW|1|NOT TRUE, TRIED IT FOR 6 MONTH AND NO HAIR GROWTH!!!!!!!!!!
B00AUFS8T0|2|Not what i wanted
B002D3VKTW|5|I have severe eczema and deal with very dry skin on a daily basis, and I use this after showering, not only is it cool which help calms my skin, it also works great as a moisturizer.  I know this sounds weird, but after I got an ultra sound on my mind section, my stomach felt smooth and soft, so I bought so ultrasound gel and started using it after my showers and love it...
B0036ZA40W|5|These are by far the best toothbrushes I have ever bought. They are extremely soft yet firm enough to do the job on your teeth. I have burning mouth syndrome and regular toothbrushes hurt! I bought 3 more. my wife loves them too. Can't recommend the enough. 5 Stars
B0013AW702|5|When I first started using Bare MineralsBare/Essentuals makeup, I could not even tell it was on my face. Now I won't use anything but Bare Minerals/Bare Essentuals! My skin is healthier and when wearing the makeup, feel's so light and I hardly know it's there! I use to not wear make up in the summer cause it all felt so heavy on my face but now I can!  It is so soft and natural.  Bare Minerals/ Bare Essentuals makeup can be exspensive but worth it!   Another plus is this seller's prices cannot be beat!  I WILL order from them again!
B00HDZGF4K|3|Thank you
B001FPTPSC|2|Too expensive for what it is. What else do you want me to say? It burns? It costs too much.
B00HX27AM4|1|I have diligently used this product for months without any significant or lasting results.  My advice is to save your money and seek the treatment from a professional.
B005PH1YNA|4|Seems a bit pricey for what it is, but they've worked well for me and I don't see any other good options out there.  In reality, if they made them in a darker brown or perhaps even some other colors I'd probably get more.
B001JOXI8W|5|I just love this product and will buy it over and over.   I wasn't sure about \\"fig\\" and lavendar, but it is totally perfecct together. The scent is not at all overpowering, but it lasts a long time.  It has a very clean smell to it. I get complimented on it every time I wear it, which is almost every day!  I highly recommemnd it.
B005YE0RSC|5|I have been using essential oils for only a couple of months now, and am just getting an arsenal built up.  I really love the oils by Plant Therapy.  As far as I can tell, they seem every bit as good as some of the higher priced oils.  I have tried a couple of less expensive brands, and they do not smell as strong or last as long as these.  These are not so cheap that you wonder if they are really any good, but they are considerably less than the YL or doTerra brands.  I really like the fruit scents, and my daughter has been concocting her own synergies using these along with Love Vanilla, another Plant therapy blend.  I will definitely buy from them again.  I have discovered, however that you can get special deals directly from the plant therapy website, and there is NEVER a shipping fee. Last week I got a free bottle of fractionated coconut oil with the purchase of 3 oils, and just yesterday they had a BOGO on two of their synergies. From now on, the only time I will order these from Amazon is if I need to pad an order to get free shipping.
B00T7WNHK2|5|We all are always looking for great deals right?  Ill tell you about the great deal but first you may want to know some other factors that are a POSITIVE.  Thank goodness for the FREE new bottle that I got from GILLETTE.  I especially am thankful for the twist and lock feature on top, no more caps to worry about or if your throwing the bottle in your gym bag or suitcase, you don't have to worry about the cap falling off which would lead to a mess.  The new rust free bottling ensures your bottle to look new & fresh.  Many of you wont notice but there is a Gel Gauge on the side to show how much you have left, this will help you be more organized when preparing your grocery list.  So I am a huge fan of my razor, I love my Power Fusion Proglide.  Since it does a great job, I could use any old shaving gel....WRONG.  See i started using this product a bit before.  I just happen to be at my local 99 cents & more store where they had this shaving gel.  NO, I did NOT get it for 99 cents but it was a great deal and you may want to check your local store to see if they may it but remember all products vary from store to store.  Being that its summer and warm, after using this shaving gel i immediately felt a cooling and refreshing feel which benefits your skin and getting a much closer shave.  How do i know its a closer shave? Well usually by 5 or 6 in the evening i could feel the stub back on my face but with this shaving gel i don't experience it as much.  You'll feel the smoothness of your shave and the smoothness of your skin.  No i am not going to show you pictures, it wont do justice.  You will just have to experience it yourself.  You will need to use both the shaving gel and the razor to know what im talking about.  When you do it, its going to be like someone saying in the back ground, &#34;I told you so.&#34;
B00GWG63OS|5|Wonderful product!!
B002XHJI9W|4|I absolutely love this mascara! It's DEFINITELY not waterproof, so make sure that you prime and apply properly, and stay out of the rain. But it makes my eyelashes POP, and it lasts a good long while - I usually give out long before it does.
B004W17O7A|5|I bought this on a recommendation for a lather brush and I am pleasantly surprised at how well it works!<br /><br />Amazon made a slight shipping error and only sent me one, when they're supposed to come in a pack of two so make sure you get both! They happily made up for it by sending me 2 more and let me keep the original 1. Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />I recommend this brush to any new to wet shaving as it's cheap, comes with 2 and works quite well!
B00A0HU3IW|5|It arrived so quickly! Love the color.
B004VRLA66|5|I was very glad to purchase Hanae Mori No.3 on Amazon, because the perfume usually retails for $95, and even on other fragrance shopping sites, it's around $45. So, buying it here on Amazon was a steal! I love Hanae Mori perfumes because they smell positively delicious, yet still retain an element of sophistication that makes them not \\"too young\\", not \\"too old\\", but just right on my twenty-something self. Being an avowed fan of Hanae Mori Magical Moon, I was looking for a sunnier perfume to counterbalance it, and No.3 fits the bill perfectly. It's floral, fruity and woody in all the right ways: the top notes consist of sunflower, bitter orange, black currant, and tomato leaf; settling into freesia, jasmine, and raspberry at the heart; and the base notes finish off with sandalwood, vanilla and white musk. The combination is glorious, perfect for the spring, and my nose can't get enough of it.
B0019D04N0|4|I ordered this mainly to stay in the same brand for my day and night cream but I like it very much. Soaks into the skin well but doesn't disappear, leaving my face feeling dry again.
B00DW8AQ3S|5|These are great! They stick on and stay on. They are even a little raised/3D and they still stay on. The silver and gold ones look really elegant.<br /><br />Caution on two things. I would use a tool and still be careful when placing them on your nail, because as I said they stick very well and they won't budge once they have been put down. The other caution is once you have placed all the stickers you are going to and want to finish off with a clear top coat, make sure to go over the stickered areas as little as possible as it will take off coloring with multiple strokes.<br /><br />Other than that I really like these and hope to get more designs!
B00I073WLE|1|Like what other one star wrote, it leave a thin layer of white powder on my face and if I put on sunscreen on top, they will mixed together to form residue all over the face.  There's once I didn't notice until my daughter help me clean up in the public!  It is not a moisturizer nor could erases any dark spots on my face.  Since it passed the eligible returning date , I won't buy it again, will use it as a final touch up to whiten my make up look.
B007ZG6CFE|5|Never smudges<br />Never fades for all my work day...Love it<br /><br />My eyes are watery and most brands dont stay...But this is good. 4 of my friends have tried and they love it.
B003TQPRGY|5|Fast shipping and the product was great; I bought it for my mum as a present and she absolutely loved it, for the price it's brilliant.
B007FAOXJW|5|I use this daily. I can never find a foundation to match my skin perfectly but this does! And the coverage is amazing but it feels so light! Gives me a nice glow! It looks flawless under a powder!
B00117VR1M|5|My favorite scent
B002RT6WXQ|3|I expected it to smell somewhat like Frankincense but it doesn't at all. It smells more like sage and oranges. I bought it because of the good reviews but am not all that excited about it.
B00ITXQ32O|1|Didn't work for me.  Didn't bubble, so I bet it was expired.  I'm trying the carbamide 35%,  Just ordered it today.  Even though the hydrogen peroxide is supposed to be stronger with shorter wear time,  it doesn't last as long as the carbamide, so I've read. So I will give the CP 35% a try (even though I also read its made with urea!) I want white teeth!<br /><br />I tried several brands,  so this review will be found elsewhere.
B0055PJ29A|4|I just received my flat iron today and I examined it and compared it to my sister in laws pyt but she has it in all black and bought it at a kiosk. I saw some differences as the pyt on the flat iron is red and not white like the others I've seen and from what I've seen in pictures online. Everything else is spot on except mine came with a couple scratches. I also noticed on the pamphlet it comes with that it states \\"if the flat iron is defective send a money order of 22.70 for shipping costs and flat iron to 300 meserole st Brooklyn ny 11206\\" which is 2 blocks away from Where I live...  Like if the pyt company is 2 blocks from Where I live which is crazy cause I lived here for 4 years. I'll just have to see how it performs. I'm kind of positive it's a fake but we'll just see. If so I want a full refund or I'll just throw it in the trash. I will update this review after I've used it.<br /><br />UPDATE: my sister in law found her pamphlets and it says the exact same thing mines say so I was wrong on that. The flat iron has a \\"new\\" smell to it so I know it isnt used. So far im pretty happy. Still haven't tried it out but I'll let you kow again on another update. Shipping was fast beyond belief. I received it in 3 days from date of purchase! So far SOO good :)
B00448JX70|1|I tried the Salon Favorite Keratin treatment at home. I followed the instructions to the T and unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Barely a result. My hair is a little softer but still frizzy and definitely not straight. I've had other professional keratin treatments in salons a few times before and they worked perfectly making my hair straight, shiny and exactly as they described.<br /><br />Salon Favorite keratin treatment definitely didn't work for me. Wont be buying again.
B000R8SAOI|5|Once again, you cannot go wrong with a brand like Shiseido. This multi-tasking anti aging, firming, brightening, plumping & moisturizing cream feels like velvet on your skin! I use it at night because it is kind of heavy but I love how glowing & smooth my skin looks/feels in the morning. Yes, I recommend it.
B001FB5IGE|4|I'm not sure if this works or it's just all marketing.  I used to just use moisturizer.
B004XLV1R8|5|I cant get these in my area I love how long they last. I just love the smell too. I will keep buying them on line.
B00CC6XSSQ|5|they are tooth brushes.
B000P2769G|4|My favorite colgne.
B0002EF590|5|I had plantar fasciitis and I tried three things at one, this splint, stretches for my feet, and Keen shoes. I don't know if the answer was one or all of these, but the combination has relived the pain I was experiencing. Wearing this splint did have an immediate affect on the pain I felt in the morning. It is a little awkward to wear, but did not affect my sleep significantly. I'd recommend this product.
B001B16MGI|5|These are my wife's comments, seriously.  Doesn't hurt like other wax (honey type).  Don't have to use the strips.  Can see where it pulls, a little red, but can't feel it. Takes a while to heat up.
B000C1Z2RI|1|Pink pepper all over. I cannot stand this one!
B0055A4DOO|5|I bought this to attack a mask to my face.  Worked perfectly.  It would stay of my face all day with out any issues.
B00MOMKFKW|5|Excelent! Product highly recomended!
B00PBGK440|3|This was inexpensive and that's what you get.  The paper feels like someone cut up the toilet seat cover you find in restrooms.  It lifts some oil but also rubs off foundation so you will have to reapply make up, and the skin still feels a little oily - I have to use 2-3 sheets.  I have a very oil skin and the best one I've used is Gatsby Facial Oil Blotting Paper, also available from Amazon (one says for Man but they're the same, go with the cheaper one).  One sheet of Gatsby and my skin feels clear of oil without losing the foundation.
B009NNFB0O|4|Came in cute packaging and will be a good gift for my hairy son!
B00EUSZFMG|4|I have been using other moisturizers such Mary Kay, but can actually tell a difference in wrinkles, a more even complexion and softness of my skin using this product.
B000NKJIXM|4|I've used mouthwash after brushing and flossing for years. When I saw that Crest now makes a multiprotection rinse that helps prevent against plaque and gingivitis as well as serving as a mouthwash, it seemed like a great way to boost my dental health.<br /><br />I've used the [[ASIN:B000052YD8 Scope Original Mint Mouthwash 50.7 Fl Oz]] for years and liked it, but of course it is only a mouthwash. Also, unlike the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse-Cool Wintergreen, Scope contains alcohol. Not a big deal for me, but if I can achieve the same results with a product that doesn't contain alchohol, why not do it? For recovering alcholics, this would be a much bigger selling point.<br /><br />I have to say that while the Crest rinse was pleasant tasting, it didn't have that same strong burst of flavor that the Scope products have. Perhaps that is due to the lack of alcohol in the Crest version, but perhaps it is simply another difference in the formulas. Whichever the case, I don't feel that the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse lasts as long as either the original mint Scope or the new [[ASIN:B002P8F4ZG Scope Outlast Mouthwash-Long Lasting Mint-25 oz, 750 milliter]] that I have recently tried as well.<br /><br />Crest's Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse might be a good option for someone who really needs a mouthwash that doesn't contain alcohol or needs more help with plaque and gingivitis prevention, but for me, I'll go back to Scope for longer lasting fresh breath and leave the other features to my Crest toothpaste, which does a fine job on its own.
B00336EUTK|5|I bought the white strips for my grandsons who had just had their teeth cleaned. I was surprised how well it really worked. Their smile is brighter and they like it as well. I couldn't be happier.
B00RVY6TIK|3|It's just ok. It definitely is only for a very small area like your desk.
B000C1ZAKC|5|I haven't used this cologne since I ran out of it in 1998, and I finally found it again. It's my favorite cologne. It's relaxing.
B005AN8BZ8|5|You get all 6 colors.  Prior to this I only had the lighter pink color and was forced to order all 6.  I thought I would have to throw away the other colors but it turned out that they don't add enough color to really change the color of my lipstick anyways as long as I only used a very light coat.  If you used a thicker coat of the gloss the color would be more obvious.  The gloss has a little sparkly glitter in it and is not too gooey (like a lot of lip glosses tend to be.)  The fact that it is not real \\"gooey\\" is why I tracked this particular lip gloss down because I cannot stand feeling the lip gloss on my lips but I want the shine.
B00461F4PA|1|I don't think it's the product, It's just my skin on my feet is so bad.  It didn't feel like a baby feet.
B007TC0HIC|2|didn't see a difference  after a month of use and it does sting a bit when you put it on.  I've moved on to a different product.
B00A7ISRFA|3|Started off using the regular cold pressed castor oil for treating unrelated  matters to hair condition. Came across this product after purchasing the hair pomade version at my local beauty supply store: found out the oil version was available, so decided to take a chance on this product. I've been battling hair loss, later thinning for years after over processing my fine-medium hair with coloring, perms/relaxers and recently over the past few years with braids.<br />Actually thought there was no hope for some balding spots to grow back after 20 yrs covering it up; tried varies hair products prior to castor oil, spending money with no significant results. Began using early February and seeing results already.<br />Giving the product only three stars due to the fact it's mixed with other oils
B00OKD6OH6|3|I didn't get a chance to try this deodorant, because I found out as soon as I got it that the ingredients on the label did not match the ingredients listed on the order page. This deodorant has soy oil in it, so I unfortunately can't use it due to an allergy. I sent it back and got a refund.<br /><br />I also noticed that it has an extremely strong artificial flowery smell that I can only imagine would be unpleasant to have floating around with me for the whole day. I don't know if the smell dissipates or not upon application.
B003156NG6|4|I USED THIS BEFORE AND LIKED IT VERY MUCH. I'M SORRY THE ONLY WAY I CAN PURCHASE IT IS ONLINE.
B000RLG8JE|5|Great product!  Easy to install on my water pick and very reasonable.  Thanks!
B00KCNFQXQ|5|Love the smell. Philosophy lotions always feel god on the skin
B00AHAWWO0|5|fast shipping, would buy again
B001ET7HQG|4|my husband loves this toothpaste which you can no longer buy in store. so its great I can get 3 tubes at a time. only compliant is the change in the top. it has a screw top instead of the flip top it used to have.
B000GG85DM|4|Works good when mixed with other products
B001HC2T0O|4|I ordered these for my family & they loved the chocolates esp. the dark ones, and loved the idea behind it.  They even said that they all felt better after eating them.  I only wish that i could've had something written in the gift box.  There's an intention gift card that they received which was empty.  It would've been nice if Amazon or Intentional Chocolates had an option to send a lil message along with this.  Other than that, i highly recommend this product- esp if you or your recipient loves chocolate.
B00MJ0N6FA|5|Gentle on my lashes.  They curl nicely.
B003ZP5GFQ|5|Can't find this in stores anymore so buy two at a time. Works excellently for me and has since it hit the market quite a while ago. Try it...you may feel the same way. I am a devotee.
B00127VFJU|5|I totally disagree with the other review. This stuff is spectacular! It even faded old scars, and by old I mean scars from 16yrs ago. I ran through about 2 bottles between late-winter and mid-summer. After the first bottle there was a noticeable difference of the discoloration in my skin; nothing drastic, but still noticeable. But like most products, you see better results after 5-8 weeks of continuous use. After the 2nd bottle, my scars are about 10% visible. If I don't point out that a scar was there, you probably wouldn't even notice.  It's usually about $9 in drug stores so the 3 for the price of 2 pack is pretty sweet.    **I would also recommend exfoliating twice a week if you want to use this product to rid hyperpigmentation on the body. Exfoliating will help lift the dead/ discolored skin and you'll get a clearer view of it working.
B000DZB5AG|5|I am always looking for something to work with my thick hair. This works very well, and the colors are lovely.
B0025YT6UO|5|It was a really good price and we will order again from them.
B00DOXNRP0|5|FANTASTIC.    I was encouraged by the positive reviews and I am NOT disappointed. This package arrived a month before the indicated date. I was amazed at how quickly it got here.    The quality of the hair is great. It's soft and silky, with a wavy style that looks even nicer than the pictures. It was packaged well and was not tangled at all. The color is vibrant and matches the pictures.    The cap is very comfortable to wear. There are a few spots that the hair seems a little thin, but when it's on my head you barely notice.    All in all, amazing value for less than $13!!!
B004ZLZR8A|4|This product is amazing.  It smells delightful, eliminates a lot of frizz and has made my hair a lot thicker.  I gave four stars because I feel it's a little expensive.
B00HQ2RB34|5|Fantastic natural shaving oil. Love it!
B00H6V4TXK|4|Very good, but didn't like that you couldn't use it or get it close to your eyes. I now have to use something else on my eye area.
B004Y9L5SO|4|Finding this in stores can be hit or miss, so I'm glad I can always find it online.  I love the color.  It's dark without being black and works well with my red-head coloring.<br /><br />I would rather have the whole pencil in green.  The white part is useless to me.
B000WIDQLK|5|This product does what it says. PLUMPS up the LASHES TO THE MAX! It lasts a long time.  There is a little clumping at times but well worth the incredible results.  One of the best mascaras on the market!  Great price!  I'll buy again!
B00J9QXSZ0|1|Sucks  didn't even come in a case not what I expected
B00CIH9JPA|5|These hair pins are pretty.  They would be great, I think, for a teenage girl going to prom or some other dance, or for a wedding if it fits your motif.  I tried them out, and they are sturdy enough.  If you put hairspray on, it might dull the crystals a bit, so think about adding them at the very end of your hair styling.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, which this is.
B001H3OYRE|1|Wrong item. Items sent did not match picture and description. Too much of a bother to send them back.
B0001NXH9W|2|Simply did not work well. Difficult to set up. Not worth the aggravation or money. Keep it simple and do it the old fashioned way.
B0009VO8P8|5|fast shipping, item was as described.
B002WTC384|3|i didn't really notice a difference with my hair from my other product I usually use.  i have reallllly thick wavy/curly hair and was really hoping this worked but it didn't do anything amazing,  im a little sad it didn't work as good as i was hoping  but i gave it to my coworker and she loved it!  She has thinner hair but still curly so i think maybe that’s why it worked better for her.
B009HKAWFC|5|In general, i recommend any remington wet2straight. Ive been usign them for years - the only reason i needed to buy this one was because i lost my last!
B0054LHI5A|5|Essential for anyone who hikes or walks more than an hour a day -- a pack of four lasts me about eight months -- and this set is a great bargain compared to the onesies next to the impulse register at my local hardware store.<br /><br />Wikipedia's story of its growth always cheers me up:<br /><br />&#34;1984–89: Founding<br /><br />&#34;Burt's Bees originated in Maine in 1984 as a candle making partnership between Roxanne Quimby and Burt Shavitz. Shavitz had a honey business which provided the excess beeswax needed for the candles and Quimby's focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow their business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 by the end of their first year. Their first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year.[13]<br /><br />&#34;Burt's Bees increased production in 1989 after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles. Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location. During this time, Quimby read one of Burt Shavitz's 19th-century books about bee-keeping which included home-made personal care recipes and Burt's Bees entered into the personal care products industry.[13]&#34;<br /><br />Robert C.

B001VNCA0S|5|This mascara is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  My lashes are almost non-existent. In fact, my family kids me about them.  I use my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, also recommended by Lisa Eldridge, and this mascara and I suddenly have lashes.  This mascara adds length and thickness.  Finally, after all these years I have eyelashes.
B004GWUPO4|5|I love Philosophy products and have been using them for the past several years. This is a good, everyday eye cream.
B00EFC2O62|5|Love the scent.  A lit bit goes a long way.  Lasts all day.  Will recommend it to anyone who loves white linen.
B0077LAJT2|5|Dollar Shave Month....IN YOUR FACE!
B00006FRW7|5|This is amazing!  I am an 18 yr/old female with oily skin, and I use this every night and most mornings, too.  My skin has cleared significantly from this product.  I love my skin now because it is so soft and my problem areas have faded away. :)  Would recommend to everyone.
B00OPCHAB6|4|So far, I like this.  I have only done one treatment, but had no adverse reactions, and I have fairly sensitive skin.  My daily facial care routine is simple; Dove sensitive skin soap and a moisturizer with SPF.  It has served me well for many years, but now, in my mid-thirties, my skin is looking a bit dull.  The product dries quickly, and you definitely feel a pulling sensation as it does.  I also felt a slight itching sensation, but again, had no adverse reaction.  My skin felt refreshed and looked radiant upon removal.  I will continue to use this mask and hope to see additional results!
B006E3STSM|2|i used this product 3 days and it seemed suitable for my skin.  However I also received the Perricone product below<br />and within 2 days I had developed a rash? over my entire face and even my ears and neckline....so I am not certain if it was one or both products that created this very bothersome reaction..  In the subsequent 6 days this is now finally subsiding. thank goodness.  I will not use any more of either product  as I now know I am allergic to them.  I have used over the years many products.and have never had any reactions such as this.  sorry....
B000GCW1P4|5|I was skeptical before using the conditioner because my hair is so unpredictable. I use conditioner every single day and still find my hair being dry and hard to fix. Usually, while drying my hair, it just falls out in my fingers leaving me with what feels like a full head of hair all over my bathroom sink. This morning, I shampooed my hair like normal and then used the Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Moist conditioner for 2 minutes, 45 seconds like the bottle said. I wasn't crazy about the strong smell of coconut, but I don't like the smell of coconut anyway. After the time had passed, I washed the conditioner out and didn't really feel any difference just upon washing it out. However, when I went to dry my hair, I had very minimal hair come out, leaving me with a clean bathroom sink! My hair also had more volume and was much easier to style. The smell of coconut also went away, just leaving me with fresh-smelling, awesome hair! I LOVE this product!
B008I2IKMW|4|These brush heads are durable and well worth the extra money compared to the generic brands. You can be assured of at least 3 months of good cleaning per brush. Also these particular ones work better at cleaning the back teeth since they have a second bristle head that works just as the first. I would recommend getting these for you general tooth brushing and the flossing head for getting in the areas between teeth. I made this a four star rating hoping you would read it.
B003S516XO|5|It's perfect for my thin hair with no static
B003N4ST94|4|I really like that this is natural.  It has a light, pretty scent.  Works as well as any other mascara I have used.  I have short lashes and while this doesnt lengthen, the definition helps.  Thick formula.
B002N5MI3W|2|The product didn't have enough hold.  I have course black Asian hair and &#34;paste&#34; products ususally work for me.  This one, however, was a disappoinment, especially considering it's price, brand name, and other ratings.  There simply wasn't enough holding power and if I used lots and lots of it, it would leave my hair stiff and crunchy, like gel.<br /><br />Others have rated this very highly so maybe it just wasn't right for my hair.  In any event, it just didn't work for me.
B002R72N36|1|Unable to sleep with them.
B000M4CNI6|5|We have owned the older version of this mirror and really like the new improvements. The mirror swivels much better and is easier to position.  The manufacturer's customer service is excellent if you should ever need it.
B0037HP9OA|5|I am amazed at how well this product works.  I am very glad I bought this and so is my wife!
B001TEMCDO|4|Just received mine today. I can't use the little mascara that came in it but I expected that. The colors of the shadows are quite a bit darker than the picture but overall look nice.
B008328Z4A|5|Great product! We always have this around.
B00Q78CBYM|5|great
B007R6BMK2|5|Excellent product- Would buy from this seller again+++++++
B00JRRL6NW|1|Total price ripoff. Only costs $165 retail.
B001CMEB82|5|Good, very good, item as described, ship as date, quality is good, it is a very good gum, I love it.
B001QD4RUY|5|Best hair gel ever. I kept having the problem of all other gels flaking. It goes on well, has the right amount of hold, smells good and it doesnt flake.
B002VWL2BQ|1|Not sure if this product was old or what, but it smelled very bad. I even tried to add some lavender oil to it, but it made no difference.
B003PH5OLU|5|I really liked this wig. It can be a full wig or half wig. The hair shipped and arrived in great timing. The quality of the hair is very nice. I love this piece.
B005PYWS60|3|The product is sturdy. I can polish now mess free.
B0002M5JO8|2|Third day I used it, it stopped rotating, cheap springs or something, won't purchase again! Don't buy this product ever, too cheap!
B001MA0QY2|1|It's not what I  was  excited
B004QD4TFE|5|TIP!<br />After opening the bag, there is still some of the serum in the little pouch. KEEP IT! It is still good to use for a couple of days if kept well.<br /><br />What I really love about this product is that it made my pimples go away and my redness and scars have lessened a bit. For me it took about three masks and TIME to let these noticeable disappearances occur. The mask is super soaked in the serum and it has a really nice fragrant of strawberries. The packaging says that you can leave it on for about 15-20 minutes but I just leave it on until the mask gets damped (not soaked). From my point the price is alright but really worth it for good results.
B000G0GW6K|5|so easy to use. its not as smooth as a wax but I love it! I've used it on my underarms, legs, and bikini area....loves it!
B006G69QXO|1|I tried it once and it made my teeth have white spots so I stopped using it. The bad thing is it didnt come with mouth guard to hold your lips away from your teeth so it was also kinda hard to use too.
B000NKHNHK|5|this is the fastestblemish zit zapper I have ever used and it really does work. Make sure to shake it up I just dip the q-tip in there gavotte on 2 or 3 times a day and if you want to put a very light layer on your blemish before applying your makeup that's also a good idea to get treatment during the day but as soon as you're at home get any makeup off the blemish you're trying to get rid of any mediately treated again and I just like to see a nice pink blob of the product and it will dry and you'll see a pink kinda crusty looking thing on your pimple. And remember do not pick or gig at your face you don't want to get scars. I just had a hormonal break out and I was trying to find this product finally I looked on the internet it's an really good thing to have in your emergency medicine cabinet for a blemish pimple zitI would not recommend this as an all over your face product I'm not a doctor but it is a Drying Lotion and I believe it's just meant to treat an individual pimple. Good luck and really give it a try it's worth every penny forget the Clearasil and the suppose it either stuff they sell at the drugstore your pimple will be gone in 24 hours no that's not true with this product you will in fact get super fast results and if you don't I would go to the doctor it could be a bacterial situation that need the doctors attention and believe me I've tried many products.
B00B900TAG|5|I use this all the time.  I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.
B000W5K1E8|3|Even though they taped the top it had leaked all in the box. It was kind of a mess. Then the bottle had tape glue all over it. I think it would have been better if they would have just wrapped the bottle. Love the shampoo though.
B00ADB2QI0|5|I ordered this for my mom and a co worker who are relaxed. They both mix it with Silicon Mix. you can buy this from amazon as well. You use equal amounts of both products I used 1 table spoon of each an mix into a container then place on hair comb through sit under a plastic cap at least a 1/2 hour. My co worker described it as hair crack!! They both love it. There is minimal hair on your comb. I would recommend the avocado for relaxed and the chocolate for the natural ladies. the best thing is a little goes a long way!!!
B000OYJ9AO|5|I love it!
B001ET769Y|4|I had placed an order and was expecting 3 - twin packs. 6 sticks total. I only received  3 sticks. I have seen some reviews with the same problem and was hoping they fixed it. I am giving this 4 stars because Degree is my favorite deodorant and Amazon customer service is top notch. I was able to return them for free and was quickly credited.
B001G7PLDW|5|Use it regularly and my hair is very healthy and shining.  Like this product line.  I've been using it for about two years and plan to continue buying the shampoo and gels.
B0002SIT1W|5|Love this brush. It works very well on my short to medium hair. Gives great volume.
B00K8EZFDA|3|I like the fragrance, but I use it sparingly.
B000A2ECHU|5|Love this eyeliner brush!  It is easy to hold and gives you flexibility for thin, medium, or thick lines.  My search for the perfect liner brush has finally ended! Give this one a try - you will be amazed with its ease of use and versatility.
B00F58M8ZW|3|The blades on these scissors are a little thicker that I had hoped they would be.  They are very sharp, but not as easily managed as my last pair that were taken away at the airport -- don't ask why I had them in my carry-on bag.  As someone else mentioned, I had to remove the rubber inserts in the holes to accommodate my fingers, which are not really very big.
B006VWVDL6|1|Nasty tasting not able to tell if works or not could not get past horrible flavor. Large long lasting yuck.
B00181OKDI|5|Amazing
B000E7UF8G|3|The product arrived in perfect condition; however, I received it several days later than expected.  I hope that this can be attributed to poor weather conditions, as I hope to continue doing business with the seller.
B004BCT7B6|1|the shadow arrived in a huge box w/ other products that were also shipped to me. there was no packaging around the shadow and it was reduced to bits and crumbled pieced when it arrived. it was clear it had been bouncing around in the box unprotected. the outside of the plastic container was all scratched up and there was a small piece of tape sealing the cover closed which was broken. it came with no shadow applicator as seen on the photo. what a disappointment.
B00BEWGTGW|5|Very happy! This item was delivered as expected and was exactly what I was expecting.
B004VM9JCS|4|This is the first eye cream I've ever tried because I have weird dry patches in the outer corners of my eyes and some dry skin above my upper lash line. I thought about using one before, but ever other one was at least $20! Plus I did not like the ingredients in the other way too expensive eye creams.<br />I saw this one at the grocery store on sale for $7 and grabbed the last tube, lucky me. I tried it out that night before going to bed and immediately loved the light silky smooth feeling of it on my skin. It dried almost instantly so I could put my regular night cream right over it without standing around waiting.<br />When I woke up after only one day and washed my face, the weird dry skin in the corners of my eyes was gone! I was so happy, that had plagued me for MONTHS. So I kept using it, kept using it. It's not even been a week and the dry skin on my upper lash line is almost completely gone. I can wear eye make up again!<br />I am however taking away one star because I hate the bottle, if you squeeze it just a bit too hard practically the whole bottle comes out and wastes product. I'd maybe suggest squeezing into a jar.
B001824JU6|5|I love Organix shampoo's and conditioners because they leave my hair soft and smelling AWESOME !!!! This product was no different..... LOVE it !!
B0084A5NQY|1|Colour is very different than shown in pitcure
B00E68O4JU|5|This really works. I have thick hair and can't believe how well it works. Very simple to operate. Easy directions.
B00C8YCFU4|4|I've paid for facials. I've paid for organic creams in small jars and tubes. I've even purchased special clay I had to mix up and put on my face. This product is different. It isn't the mystique of being from the Dead Sea. It's that the product really does what it says. It takes the impurities, excess oils, and grime right out of my skin. I &#34;glow&#34; after a Dead Sea mud mask. Now, granted, the stuff smells like, well, it came from a sea in which something might have, say, died, but they've covered most of that up with the other organic ingredients. And, that's another thing. The list of additional ingredients is amazing! They're organic/natural, and I'm beyond impressed. I can get (the manufacturer claims) thirty uses from this one jar. If that turns out to be true, that'll be less than one dollar per mask.<br /><br />I quality-tested this product at the manufacturer's request. I do not hold a stake in the success of this product or the company which created it. I hope my review helps you with your purchasing decision.
B0087PWNJG|4|Pantene sets the standard for hair care: something my mom purchased for the household when I was young (it was one of the only shampoo/conditioners available in bulk during early Costco/Price Club days), and this conditioner does the trick on my thick hair: goes on nice and smooth, rinses clean, and conditions well. I have little more to say except that if you can get this bottle of conditioner for around $11-$13 bucks, it is well worth it. Would definitely recommend the daily moisture renewal conditioner from Pantene: it performs exactly as it should.
B001443R74|2|Formula is different.  Doesn't work like it used to.  :-(
B001CE6T76|2|These are horrible quality! I suggest just spending an extra $1 to get better ones faster. I honestly was expecting something I could use. These are coming apart and the ends don't stay in! TERRIBLE! What a waste of time.
B00L0R5494|4|It is valuable.
B000RO3EMA|5|To sooth the itching inside my husbands ears. Corn Huskers was recommended by his Primary Care Physician to be the best.
B009KBMWCY|1|Not worth the time flaky and gets all over your face.
B008CO4V8I|5|As expected. Everything is fine.
B003MC1ZSE|5|This product was first suggested to me in lieu of doing a Keratin Express process.  I am so glad I tried this!  I have very thick and slightly wavy hair.  This product really helps to straighten and smooth out the hair shaft, leaving your hair soft, silky and shiny - like you just had a salon blowout.  I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it!
B0045D7BG4|5|Just as described.  Thanks!
B00BK3T6JM|2|It different and left me with a purple lips ( mouth)
B003GU2GSK|1|WARNING: ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />I think my order was tossed into the nearest (too big) empty box so fair that anything else (like padding) was forgotten. Needless to say my order finally (FINALLY!) showed up in a box that was A) too big, B) lacking ANY/ALL padding, and therefore C) semi-wet and reeking of semi-dry Finesse conditioner (you know--that wonderful Finesse fragrance?). It looked like the bottle had rattled around in that big virtually empty box until the plastic cap eventually cracked and leaked out more than half of the bottle's  contents. I\\"m just glad this part of my order shipped separately! To add insult to injury my complaints went UNANSWERED, DELETED, IGNORED. Boo!<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to award one star so I could post this review, but I'm not convinced I'm not who should be awarded stars.<br /><br />Rating for this shopping experience:<br />  Product = Meh (2 Stars)<br />  Shipping = HORRIBLE Packaging/Shipping and Nonexistent/Invisible(?) Customer Service  (-27 Stars)<br />  Chance of Me Ordering from this Merchant Again? = Snowball/Hell/Etc.<br /><br />  ~ R
B00CD1QU80|5|Work like charm!
B006U1WT66|5|really clears up your pours. try the soft brush first because the standard brush might be a bit harsh. affordable and works great.
B0093P3AUU|5|Doesn't feel or look like foundation. Yet it gives the appearance of a healthy, even toned skin. Doesn't rub off on your clothes. Great for a person active in sports.
B00NUPUDJ0|5|Very effective nightly facial cleaner- my face has been noticeably less red, and it never feels dried out OR artificially moisturized after I use the product. Probably the best facial cleaning product I've ever used.
B00PPCVIR2|1|Warning, It's does not work, even you follow instruction. if you have time to remove one hair at the time, you need to zap the hair more than 3 times to get it somewhat burn off, can not use on the sensitive skin area.<br />But worst, you can't return it!!!! Beware!!!
B00R55W2ZY|5|very nice
B00120VWJ0|5|Feels really nice to your skin and scalp. Be careful about getting in eyes though, it would probably sting. Hair, scalp, and skin feels sooooo clean after use!
B0039YQG2A|5|I've used all kinds of hair coloring from really expensive to really cheap.  The black color of Colorsilk is the truest and looks the best on me.  There is no red tint or blue tint.  Just black and it covers my 80% gray hair perfectly. It is the best value getting a 3 pack for just under $10 bucks.  The little conditioner packet is small so I just use extra that I have on hand.  I'm done trying all different brands and sticking to this one.
B003YBP0N4|4|After going for a facial, the massage therapist suggested that I purchase Neocutis Eye Cream for the delicate area around my eyes.  I inquired as to the cost and was surprised to learn they were selling this product for ninty-five dollars.  I liked everything she told me about this cream so I did some research after getting home and found it through Amazon for fifty-eight dollars. I ordered it using the free shipping method and was pleased that it arrived so soon.  I use one small dot (about the size of a BB) for each eye both morning and night and must say I am very pleased with the results.  This small bottle lasts a good 2 months using the method I described.  I'm seventy-one years old and will continue to use this product as it's the best that I have found.
B0065I0UMO|5|I bought this product after reading great reviews on it. Having a continuous battle with folliculitis, my skin often gets dry and itchy, especially with all the topical prescription medications I use. The First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream does a fantastic job of keeping my skin soft and moisturized. Red, itchy skin is thankfully a thing of the past! This is one of those products that just works.
B000GX795K|4|I bought this razor on a recommendation in Consumer Reports. I switched from a rotary head razor and, as the user's guide predicts, it has taken a few weeks to get used to this one, but it does give a very close shave. The cleaning station is a cool idea, but it's decision as to how dirty the razor is (which determines how much cleaning fluid it consumes) it purely a programmed response - for example, emptying the razor yourself has no effect, and if you put it back in its station but don't clean it then a day later it will decide that the razor needs a more thorough cleaning. Since the cleaning cartridges are consumable items, and not particularly cheap, I've found that leaving the razor out of its cleaning station for 3 or 4 shaves is one way to conserve cartridges. YMMV.
B00CGNUTW8|2|I was really disappointed with these eyelashes, They look like they are made of black rubber or plastic;; I was going for a more natural look
B00VF8FFMY|2|I received blue bags with a nautical theme. I wanted the pink ones in the photo.  Too late to return as I need them today.  Also just plastic.  Disappointed.
B000NL5Z92|5|Very good shampoo.
B00D3EXMM8|5|Amazing hair dryer, the best one I ever had. I don't even need a comb! My hair is curly and big and I had no problem to dry it. And looks so straightened that I don't need to iron it.
B004IR6TY2|5|I am a nail technician and have two of these racks.  The price was great and they really hold a lot of polish.  I've owned them for about 4 or 5 years and they still look the same as when I bought them, and they've been moved twice.
B006GH6WY4|5|Love this product
B004PXIR1W|4|Great product, still messing with it to get the perfect trim.  Only complaint would be that it's really hard to EVENLY trim as it sometimes required you to go over the same section repeatedly but this could be user error.
B003JM4OCG|5|It was exactly what I wanted since they do not make the exact make up I use to use. This make up is nice and thick. It hides all my freckles just like the kind before. It leaves me without a oily face by the end of the day. Very Pleased!
B00AOBJCJK|5|Makes cutting mush easier. I really like them. I bought two.
B00B76F12S|5|This works perfct to hide my tattoos at work. It comes with 2 in the pkg. Doesn't move around or slip.I usethe second one for my ankle tattoo. Great buy!
B003UQB0JQ|5|I like this product for oil absorption.  It's extremely hard to get other than on Amazon.  Hopefully, they'll keep it in stock.
B00KNS6VJI|5|Bought it for my wife; she loves it!
B001O2SEOM|1|I only received only one of the package of two
B00JEMR8UK|2|I give this cleanser only 2 stars because it does not clean the skin well at all. It is not economical as well. The smell is pleasant and the foam is pleasant too but it does not matter since this cleanser does not do what it is supposed to.
B005G9WK8U|5|Great exactly what I was looking for for my travel toothbrush
B000F4GLE0|5|I used to buy Honesty by Trucco lipstick for years.  The shade became too dark for me as I got older so i decided to see if I could find another lighter color.  I tried this color but it is too brown for me does not look like the picture at all.  Plus it looks like from everything I have seen that Trucco is discontinuing this lipstick.  I gave the lipstick to my sister she absolutely loves it and like I said it was not the formula because the formula is great it was the color. I have not been able to find a color I like.
B000GDA06A|5|I have bought the whole kit at sephora I bought the trial kit loved it so much bought more from Amazon because it was so much cheaper noticed a change in my face after the 3 day brighter skin and sunspots a whole lot lighter loved it so much I ordered the acne kits to try for my teenage kids I hope it work as well I will write a review on that kit. Love the products very good !!!
B00BLFO2NY|5|My hairdresser uses this superglue but charges me 18$ for it! This is a steal.<br />It has great hold, if you squirt maybe a dime-sized in your hands, you have about 10 seconds to style your hair before it solidifies. Good because it sticks well.<br /><br />Oh, it doesn't do the best under sweat, starts to break down. But all in all highly recommended (and at a discounted price!)
B000O2LVI4|2|I would like to see if this product really works, but it made my face break out, so I had to quit using it. I may give it another shot in the winter, or try it on my hands.
B0012UEJ1S|5|I have used this product for several years and believe it improves the appearance of my colored, curly hair.  My hair is in good condition, but tends to frizz and look dry.  I used this as a conditioning product once a week before shampooing and this works for me.  I can't always find it in local stores and Amazon prime delivers it right to my door.
B001216C76|3|I should have ordered one with less enlargement.  This one is convex which is like a fish eye.  Very small space in center without distortion.
B00PMRE5A2|5|I love it...and so does my 19 year old daughter who I have to hide it from. It just feels great on my skin and I think it works.
B001Q6JPOE|5|In the winter, I must admit I get lazy about washing my hair but with a few shakes of this lovely scented powder (I love the lavender/clary sage) my hair looks and feels great. The added surprise benefit is that is gives my hair more body. Can't live without it. I want to try the jasmine next.<br />It also lasts a very long time because you don't use very much.
B007FAQZOS|5|I was breaking out in exzema from my last product and needed something more natural.  I love the jurlique hand lotion so I decided to try this.<br /><br />Overnight I used all three products and can see a HUGE difference!  I missed my old skin!  I thought that I had circles under my eyes and patchy skin because I just had a baby and I have hormones and I'm tired and not taking that great care of my skin but after these products I know that I was just not using the right stuff.<br /><br />I LOVE these products and my skin looks great.  I hope they come out with a SPF day lotion in this line too
B0002Z8QHC|5|great i really liked the control it gives to me and my family. i will buy another one in the near future.
B003FENQ8G|5|love it
B00AQ28DNI|1|I used Oxytokin and it did nothing, in fact it was the only cream I've used that I really couldn't believe was so bad!  I don't know how it got such high ratings but to me it wasn't worth the price!
B003TYGDDM|5|AAA+++FAST SHIPPING
B0020MM8V0|4|The scent lasts all day. Its not too strong and overpowering but just the right amount to give a mild fragrance. To me the fragrance is not so unique as you can get it confused with other fragrances. Overall its not a bad buy if you are looking for an everyday wear
B003KWW9UO|4|First tem ever i have tried the deodarants from Pld Spice.Tried the fresh collection series(cyprus) from old spice, the scent is good and worh buying it.
B003AYEFU4|4|Aussie is one of my go-to brands because of the value. Pay little and get lots. I have naturally wavy hair and this stuff keeps it in place all day while giving it a natural finishing look. It's easy to use and smells great!
B005SPMINY|4|It seems most of the criticism for this product are from people that thought this was a lathering cream.  It is a gel, but personally, I use creams without lather.  I hate lather, but enjoy gels and creams for the lubrication, and to some degree smell, but you can actually whisk this up to a bit of a froth.<br /><br />The fragrance is merely okay for me, hence 4 stars, but otherwise I have had no issues with this gel.  My current favorite is Spelck's product, a smell my wife loves as well.<br /><br />- lubricates nicely<br />- smells like soap
B002P3L06I|5|I have to say I was not sure that it would be the same as the one I am used to buy in my home country (Saudi Arabia). However, after I bought it I was surprised by the high quality i received! The packing was great and the product was perfect, exactly what i wanted!
B0079R6BD2|5|I just tried this shampoo and so far it feels good, smells good, and makes my hair shine. Will try to update soon!
B000NNAXN8|2|This dye does not go very far and barely lasted a week in my pre-bleached hair, even after letting it sit for approximately 8 hours. The color was very bright to start with, but quickly turned pale yellow. If you want NEON hair, I would suggest special effects napalm orange, I used this product and am much happier with it.
B000C2104G|5|excellent..
B00MPXP8AW|4|Best Shea Butter I have come across in a while. One of the best on the market. I love the consistency of this raw shea butter. Absorbs to skin well and leaves a healthy glow that is not to greasy. I used it in my hair and diy leave in conditioner products. Awesome texture! Just wish it could be purchased as a package deal like 2 for 10 or 2 for 15. I bought two for roughly 30 dollars (including shipping and handling).
B0016ZZW7E|5|I have been using for several years now & I love this product.  I have even had massages with it.  Wonderful!
B0017QVEUG|5|As I've &#34;matured&#34; (ahem) my brows have become sparse. This seems to thicken up and tame the ones I have left.
B000YJ2FUA|2|I used this product after Garnier Fructis anti-Humidity styling gel was discontinued. It seemed good when I applied it to damp hair and proceeded to blow dry my hair. But a half hour later my skull became very itchy and uncomfortable.  Unfortunately this product did not work for me.
B00L8JBNE4|5|Natural, moisturizing, love it! No offensive perfumes, ideal for use &#34;as is&#34; or for adding other ingredients to concoct your own beauty product.
B002H6SVMY|5|The first liquid eye liner that I've fallen in love with! I've been going natural with my beauty products and have just discovered the Zuzu luxe line.  This liquid eye liner is AMAZING.  I love it so much!  It stays on all day, doesn't budge unless YOU budge it.  Smear is minimal, but expected.  I don't put it on the lower lash line though.  It goes on so smooth and is non-irritating.  I'm so used to eyeliners irritating my eyes (stingy sensation, burning, and tearing up), so this was an unexpected relief!  Whew!  I love it...Its the best eye liner and I've tried so many kinds - YSL, Stila, Maybelleine, Urban Decay, etc. and this tops them all.  Only thing is, the eyeliner is not waterproof at all, barely water resistant.  It washes off easily though.  For the lower lash line, I use a little pencil.  Thanks Zuzu Luxe!!
B003RPCEW2|5|This conditioner makes your hair fill smooth and silky. My hair hasn't felt this soft in forever, last a while so it is worth the money.
B009H17ODE|5|I've tried the generic knock offs of this floss and it just shreds in your teeth. This is great stuff and to one of the few items I'm very brand loyal. If you have tight areas between your teeth, this is great, it's really smooth and flat and slides right in. I always get good check ups :-D
B0012MZ4WE|4|My wife has tried several different clinical-strength antiperspirants, but favors the Dove Clinical Protection over all the others.  The main difference is that the Dove provides comparable performance while also being much more gentle on your skin.  Other similar products seem much more harsh when compared to the soothing feel of the Dove Clinical Protection.<br /><br />Note that the manufacturer recommends that you apply it before bedtime and doing so definitely makes a big difference in its effectiveness.  However, not everyone will want to do this every night.<br /><br />The Cool Essentials also has a very pleasant mild scent.
B002QI2TPI|1|Un natural Brown color it looks like the color of a crayon brown. I got the blonde for my mom she didn't like it so she gave it back I have dark brown hair and the blonde looks like a light brown more natural looking so I use it everytime since I got it in January 2014
B00LA196FS|5|I love the smell!!!
B006W2SYI0|4|razor is good direction on how to use the cleaner hard to understand pictures dont help better direction needed will be ol
B007QUZX7C|5|Both these products do a great job of cleaning without drying your skin. However, I like the foaming cleanser a lot better.  The hydrating cleanser is similar to Noxema. It’s a cream and it doesn’t lather up which is something I just can’t get used to. The foaming facial cleanser lathers up just the right amount. I cleans your skin but also moisturizers.
B000C1Z19M|5|MY FAVORITE PERFUME.WAS REALLY INEXPENSIVE.
B00CH3OIQA|5|Item arrived quickly and as described.  it's my favorite color at the manicurist decided to buy a bottle for home.
B003BQ6QXK|5|I was just looking for a shower mirror (for shaving), and I have previously tried the ones that hold up with suction cups. Those don't work very well, they will fall down eventually, and they do fog up.    This one works a bit differently, it's held up with silicon and adhesive tape. It holds hot water inside of it so it actually doesn't fog. I find that the squeegee is useless, but other than that the mirror lets me shave in the shower without issue.    Here are my thoughts summed up:    - Doesn't fog  - Setup is easy  - Hasn't fell down (yet)  - Squeegee is a useless bonus
B0046KHE1S|2|The bottles were not well packed and they opened during shipment, creating a gooey mess inside the shipping carton.  Be aware that, in addition to the rosemary essential oil in these products, there is synthetic fragance added also.  The fake smell was overwhelming.  We returned this order.
B00I3ZNQXC|4|Doesn't go on as smoothly as I would have hoped. I have the blur face and the smooth pore egg from tonymoly, this isn't quite like those products. Leaves my skin kind of sticky and cakey feeling.<br /><br />...I really wanted to like this product.
B001H93YF6|5|This is a great alternative to expensive mineral foundation out there. This did not cause break out and makes my skin appear healthier and smoother. It has a good coverage that last a while. Horrible container though. The brush is awful and is too harsh to use in your face and the container takes too much space in the makeup bag.
B0037YGV3Q|5|works great on my kids hair
B00A28FL5Y|3|IT IS OK
B003H6FPVI|4|I bought this as i did not want to spend a great deal of money on my first epilator in case i could not handle it. well i can, this thing rips hair out like a champ.<br /><br />Cons,<br />-cordless mode is about useless it works slower and the batteries don't last<br />-Its loud.<br />-the &#34;Facial&#34; epilator atachment is not much use it just gave me a friction burn so i stick to the normal one<br /><br />Pros<br />-Works well and fast in corded mode<br />-seems well built i dropped it and it still works.<br /><br />overall i recemend this as a good starting point for those just getting into an epilator for the first time. but if you already know what your doing look elsewhere.
B00HA13JH8|5|absolutely love this belt buckle!! it is not too heavy and looks great with my jeans.. i like the black with the silver together, makes the rose really stand out.. i would definitely recommend this..
B002IJNVGG|4|Very nice medium to thick lotion. Covers well and absorbs fast. Non-greasy. It is a lotion, not a cream, so I don't know that it is suppose to be much thicker than what it is. Used daily after showering. Can keep up skin's moisture level most of the year. Hands are a bit dry in the cold and dry months, especially if washing them frequently, but typically find only a cream or something like this used multiple times a day can keep up with that. Would purchase again other than the scent. Can't quite place what it is other than what another reviewer described as an old lady smell. Slightly musty, wildflower-ish. One of the better &#34;natural&#34; lotions. Very good price for this size lotion.
B000G1EQ1W|5|The shaver is very nice.  It is easy to handle, and solidly constructed.  I have used it now for three weeks, and I have no complaints.  It doesn't get as close as a razor, but as I use to also shave my head, it doesn't nick/cut/slice open the skin.  The self-clean feature is wonderful, as it smells great, and all of the clippings are removed.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good electric shaver.
B000AMDOAQ|1|I should have read more of the reviews. This towel does do a good job of drying without the frizz, but it's WAY TOO SMALL. If you have hair longer than your shoulders, it's too small. It also doesn't stay when wrapped in a turban style. Not happy.
B00DY80PJQ|5|Used to make diaper rash cream which seems to work well.  I think this is a large quantity for a fair price.
B0001YOPVA|4|This perfume is mild and mysterious. Its perfect for the first date or for the first meet the in laws day. Aptly named romance, it is subtle and fresh.
B008CYDADK|5|These make washing windows a breeze - even second story ones. No streaks, no dust from towels or newspaper. Just water and this product. Hope Windex doesn't quite making them.
B00H8A2KSU|4|Just about half way through my first puck (4 months of alternating rotation) and I'm really enjoying it. The scent is mild and pleasant, with a lot of the shea butter fragrance coming through. The lather itself is thick and rich, with a lot of moisturizing power. This has become my preferred soap in the winter months when the air is dry and my skin needs some extra care. The only reason I took off a star is that the soap can be a little unforgiving if you don't get the water/lather ratio just right. I've had a few occasions where the lather was (very) slightly drier that it should have been, and the abundance of natural oils pulled and clung to the head of my razor causing some skipping and the occasional neck burn. I can usually get away with a larger margin of error with other soaps and croaps. However, when it's right, it's really good!
B00S9D6RHU|5|Im happy with my brushes, they arrived earlier than the were suppose to, and each brush still came wrapped in plastic covering. Highly recommend to buy these brushes. I all ready started using mine.
B0070TSNSA|5|i'm so happy i came across this lotion.  it's huge, so will last a long time, rubs in easily, and it smells amazing!  my two year old son thinks it smells like ice cream, haha.  i especially love how low it rates on ewg.  it's my new favorite :)
B00HYE27PG|4|This wig is lovely in color 99J. The curls are beautiful and the hair is soft. I did not like the fact that the cut is so asymmetrical. I counteracted this problem slightly by pulling the wig over as much as I could towards the shorter side to even things up a bit. In doing so, I had to repart it in another section so I could not take advantage of having the deep invisible part showing. It was also shorter than I expected it to be on me, but it was still a great look for me.
B00WIXBRGI|5|When I first saw this sponge online I thought immediately of my dry skin on my nose. Then upon reading further I saw that it also helps to remove the bacteria that causes acne and thought of my 14 year old son.<br />I ordered one for each of us and when they came in the mail I read my son the package and instructions on how to use it. It felt very hard and I thought to myself, I  will never get him to use this. Boy was I wrong!!<br />So this hard rough sponge has directions to soak it really well in water before using. Well let me tell you these get soft!!! My son and I not only love them but I think it's adding at least 5 mins to his shower time!! (Which for a 13 year old boy is welcomed!!)<br />He and I have both seen a decrease in black heads in just a week. And I have noticed that my skin is much softer.<br />I have to disclose that I received this sponge at a highly discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. And I can honestly say that I will be buying more of these even at full price when it is time to replace them. I think they are really great and I feel so happy to have had the chance to try them!
B002WPZNRG|5|Love this.
B00XYU6U2A|5|Works very well and is much better quality than I expected it to be. The fabric is a good sturdy fabric that won't easily fray.
B003CIT544|5|Excellent product. Excellent service!!
B000GGG01G|1|Expected the 4.5 oz. size that I got the last time for the same cost!!!  The product is fine but too expensive to  pay that price for only 1.5 oz.  I'll buy elsewhere next time.
B009XRF9SY|4|I got this for a woman in her 80's and so far she's pleased with the results. Of course the Anti-Aging factor is over the long term so I can't offer much about this so early in use. The one complaint I did hear was the tone of the color is too light, it's rated \\"medium\\" so understand this might be lighter than expected. It is rated at SPF 40 so helpful to protect from the harmful sun rays. I'll update this review if I hear any new news about this product.
B005KK797W|2|I have fine hair.  This brush doesn't pull on my hair when dry but wouldn't reccomend it for wet hair.  The brush is very large and isn't preferred for styling.  The bristles also hurt my scalp.  This maybe better for someone with thick coarse hair texture
B00A51P1VC|3|The brushes Just came in and the first thing i did was check how sturdy they are. Neither the brushes nor their hair come off when I tug so thats good, BUT the eyebrow brush came un attached which can easily be fixed but still, scares me about the quality of the brushes. All in All they are okay.
B002LIXWPY|5|love this
B004O9O5MC|5|good
B000J45DTU|4|here we go again, reviewed this through email notification which does not take it out of my amazon account when i log in.  this product is pretty good but not the exact quality as those in the salon.  For the price and being able to acquire it when unable to order with a license for the real product, this does suffice!
B00ZKLLZAI|5|At first I didn't think that there would be any difference in using this product compared to regular whitening toothpaste but I was wrong. I received the product from bzz agent.<br />I noticed a difference in my teeth after just a few uses. i have tried white strips in the past but did not like the feeling of tooth sensitivity so I would discontinue after only a few days. However, white this toothpaste I get the same results without the sensitivity. Plus it's easy to remember to whiten because you aren't going to forget to brush your teeth. I got my first trial for free but I plan on purchasing this as a daily regimen.
B004BZODEE|5|Yup just the right color. I was scared when the dye turned a red color but it came out just beautifully.
B00MX3BKRY|2|In the photos the product looked yellow or neon yellow, but it is a brown-gold color in person.
B00FN1ASS0|3|Too sticky!
B00B1KCTMA|1|I bought this based on the reviews, as i was looking for a product to maintain and strengthen my hair. I've never seen my hair break so much. It makes my hair weak and brittle and leaves white in the roots and all over, making the hair look dirty. This does the exact opposite of it's supposed to do. My hair is relaxed btw.
B00I50OJI6|5|Love it
B000W3ZCE4|4|It is just as described, seems potent enough and works as described. It is easy to purchase from Amazon. Buy
B003FP5LGU|5|I love this stuff ! it lets you get a great suntan without burning and your skin turns a golden brown !!! To bad Aveda doesn't make this anymore !!
B006VV3G12|1|this product is so stupid what is the thing you put in your shower and stick your  foot in you stick your foot in there I don't care to  don't waste your money on this product
B001A3DNY6|4|This is the shave soap I use on a regular basis to shave my legs with a trak-2 blade. This soap does the job and is inexpensive. My husband likes Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap as his &#34;go-to&#34; shave soap for his DE blades.
B00009RF1E|4|I didn't really care about the reviews that said it was loud when I ordered it but dang is it loud.  I've had my head buzzed with some pretty loud clippers and have worked in factories around fairly loud equipment (ear plugs always required), have a system in my car and truck and I still consider these very loud. They do cut very well, mine came fully charged. The caddy or stand isn't very useful as you can't get all of the guides in there, or really any. I got one to sort of stay but every time I move the clippers it fell out so I just keep them in the bag.<br /><br />Not too bad on noise for the front of you face and neck but anywhere close to your ear and it's VERY loud.<br />Cuts great, I have thin hair so it always takes a few passes with any trimmer.<br />GF commented on how much softer my beard felt the first time I used it.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone as long as you don't have sensitive ears.
B00FYZZWQS|5|the product is very simple it massages the g spot right away and the clit at the same time. It fits right on the shibari wand. My girlfriend loved it and it is easily cleaned.
B001E6SDFI|5|This shampoo is so full of moisture you don't really even need the conditioner.  Instead of washing your hair twice, you only need to wash it once with this shampoo.  If you have dry, damaged or brittle hair, I highly recommend this shampoo.  You will not be sorry.
B001GXKN6G|5|Love the product esp. since Avon has discontinued it, but the price was a bit high. I have since found it at craft shows.
B0050OX4O0|4|Its nice. I use this to do oil treatments once a week. Its not bad. I would recommend.
B000VCD4D2|5|I am really glad I bought this three piece set.  It gives me the best shave I've ever had and will not give it up.
B0012XQ5XA|4|Heard great things about this product.  Use it twice daily with my Clarisonic and it does a great job cleansing my skin.  Haven't noticed a tightening of my skin (I'm 63), but I do like the way my skin feels after using it.
B005UXZN04|5|Amazing fragrance, great deal love it! I'll buy more highly recommend
B0052FXF3M|5|Excellent Product
B000UQB2TM|3|Could be me, but I expected the shaping attachments to made of hardened/non flimsy metal.  They look good, but due to a shaping attachments bending, I was somewhat disappointed.  I have not yet put them to use,  but expect to do that in the not too distant future.
B005P0M69I|5|It's a beautiful product
B000GCSD60|5|I always get worried about buying name brand perfume offline.  Ice just heard to many horror stories. But I'll be back to buy another bottle when I run out because this was as if I bought for full price at Macys happy customer!
B0073RSF78|1|I bought this product after hearing how gentle it was. Let me tell you, this stuff is not gentle. I applied to my upper lip and left on for 10 minutes like the directions say to do. After a few minutes, the cream was burning. I decided to leave it on for the last few minutes and washed it off with cool water and washcloth. This product burned my skin. I have a nasty red, painful rash above my upper lip. Its awful :( I will never ever ever buy this product again and I suggest no one else does either. It will burn you. Chemical burns on your face sucks....avoid this product!
B0002SA9BU|3|I haven't been taking them that long but they actually work. The fact that you have to take so many is really annoying. They are so big that you can barely swallow them but my hair and nails have grown. This is the 7th of December and I've only been taking them since November.
B003UVUKE2|3|moisturising, smells like watermelon If I didnt like the color so much I would buy a different product , wear doesnt last long to  creamy wich is good for lips not for extended wear always have to reapply
B00D2FPVRW|3|OK, worth the price
B000UK2W4C|5|My dentist she recommended this toothbrush which according to her would help my gengivitis. I did some research since I was confused with all the different models and I wanted to get a best buy - the best for my money.  As part of the research I called Philips and told them my intention to get it on Ebay. The young man adviced me to get it through Amazon, since they honor the warranty b/c they have no way of knowing who sells them on Ebay or where they get their toothbrushes.    Since I am so used to buying on Ebay, I continued my search with them and finally ordered the one I was sure was a best buy. I just made sure I'd check the reputation of the seller which was good and ask them if the box was sealed.  She responded that yes, it was closed and brand new...    I just received my best buy.  Not only the box was not sealed... but the hard plastic inside had been broken (which means it has been opened and taken out) but also the battery had been charged and the small wire that holds together the electric cords had been messed with.    Now I am left with doubts... I already contacted the seller telling her that I am contacting her before I write the feedback to allow her the chance to make amends but I am facing now a situation which I could have avoided had I listened to the young guy at Philips.    So, just so you know! Maybe, if I get lucky, it has NOT been used. YUCK!
B0001TJX2Q|5|I love this product! I've been using it for months in my hair and have noticed my hair not only growing faster but being so much softer! I definitely recommend this product for so many uses.
B000BU64WM|5|This smells so great!  I have very short hair, so I use it as a shampoo, and I've had no problems, even though it's only  2-in-1 rather than a 3-in-1 product.  Perfect for the holiday season, and great for after the holidays too!
B001A7YGS4|5|I love this stuff. It fills in all my little blank spots and makes my hair look much fuller.
1403790965|5|This is my favorite bronzer!
B00GN9OYHW|5|This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients. The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available. Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally & show visible results for an extremely reasonable price. Furthermore, the company donates a portion of the proceeds of EVERY bottle sold to a women's charity in Morocco. (Read all about it on the Poppy Austin website.) You will love this product as well as their rose water toner, Vitamin C Serum and argan oil. So glad I found these amazing products. I will never switch skin care products again. Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer. I recommend argan during the day and barbary fig before bed (as it tends to make skin a bit shiny).
B00LWU6QWS|1|I have super short hair and this will not work for me.
B002RBF1PO|4|this works great especially with the blades that are supplied with it.  of course, it takes a little time to get used to shaving with this style of razor but once one is used to it, what a smooth shave.  No burn and have finally stopped nicking myself.
B005ISBERC|5|Of all the bath and shower products I have used in my 65+ years, this is the best I have ever used. Yes, it is quite expensive but I believe it is certainly worth it.
B00P8CQK90|5|Sample received.<br /><br />As a long time user of coconut oil that solidifies at room temperature, I was interested to see the product.  It does meet up to its claim and stays liquid at room temperature.  Unlike other coconut oils, it does not taste or smell like coconut.<br /><br />This oil can be used for cosmetics or consumption.
B004F0MJZU|5|This helps to protect my hands from heat while using a blow dryer and the curling iron. Great product. dont hesitate to buy.
B00D58Q63E|5|A good skin product
B00592MMPA|5|I first bought this from Target and absolutely love the fact that this is easy to apply and lasts the whole day I am at work, feels comfortable and makes lips look smooth and plumped up. - Target did not have it and so I ordered it from Amazon.  It was a little more pricey that Target, however I love the color and so I will buy this again.
B000EVGQ8U|5|Love this product!  Dries quickly, enhances the color of your polish and leaves a hard top coat. I do my own mani and pedi's so when I am done they look and feel like I just had a professional do them...And the dark color does not rub off.
B00L4FNIA4|5|great quality and arrived on time!
B003U2QT4Q|1|I was very disappointed with this product. I used the whole container as directed and saw absolutely no change or improvement in my spider veins.
B001VEK1LW|5|good buy,would buy again because the blade set fit my razor, the last one didn't fit so I had to buy just the blade
B000L596FE|2|The bristles are so flexible that it doesn't grab my wet hair so I can brush the tangles out.  I regret buying it.
B00GY05XDO|3|Hi, I ordered these tips, well nails and they came fast.  I do like them as they look natural and they fit all sizes.  However, I was disappointed when I saw they were not &#34;tips&#34; as advertised.
B000FEKMQI|3|Not very aromatic.  Wax is fine and does a great just, was hoping for more of a spa experience with the fragrance.  Disappointed.
B00V96SSTO|5|These are some of the softest brushes I have every had.
B004KEU336|5|It's perfect! It comes in a new spray can that does not clog like the old cans so you can use every drop.  I love to spray it in my hair and on my body for parties and just for fun.  Looks great and I love it!
B004D267VC|5|Works great.
B000V33PQM|3|I have no problem with the product itself. However, I believe the photos shown for the Chestnut and the Espresso colors are reversed. I ordered the Chestnut but it's much lighter color than the photo of the pencil shown.
B00EE9AHQA|4|This came half empty as the pump has no lock. The seller thankfully refunded me.  We love it as a shampoo/body wash. If there were different packaging I'd be more likely to purchase again.
B00HNM0LFC|4|Wonderful neutral color for variety of skintones. I am fair and it looks great alone or over a lipstick. Not too tacky and has staying power. Love it!
B0026IBSVE|5|very good deserves this prise.
B008B9Y0EY|5|Needed this
B003WR3QSG|3|It's an OK brush for the price, but it's on the smaller side.
B00J2APD0G|5|After a few weeks of using a new type of women's razor (not my usual Venus)....I felt like pampering and opted to use this for my legs and underarms and really like the results. I find that men's razors work better with gel shaving creams versus old standards like Barbasol and I get a smooth shave without irritation when using this product with a gel. This one didn't reach my husband, but as a general rule, Gillette Fusions are a favorite of his.

B007KPY9SM|5|I know this product is &#34;good for your skin&#34; and your body, but it really is very &#34;white&#34; and difficult to rub in. i am keeping it because it's hard to find chemical free products that works well.  Stays on even after a long bike ride.
B004B8AZH0|1|Men and women users of Gillette Fusion, Mach 3, & Sensor blades/shaving systems, the price you pay for these products is outrageous and not worth the money you paid for them.  If your looking for a quality shave please read this review:<br /><br />I have owned every Gillette produced shave system, from the Sensor to the Fusion type blades and I will be totally honest, The best that worked for me was the Mach 3 (I shave a lot, I am in the military and have been for twenty years) with this said I had a friend that convinced me to return to the old school single blade double edge safety razor and after a little bit of a learning curve, I now get the best shave that I ever recieved from any manual style razor system.<br /><br />I calculated blade costs for a year:<br /><br />Gillette Fusion $190.32 (per year with blade change out every week)<br />Derby double edge razor blade: $10.40 (per year with blade change out every three days)<br /><br />Note: When using double edge safety razor blades every blade reacts differently to each individual.  You will have to research to see what works best for you.  For this reason the price/cost savings may differ.<br /><br />If you have thoughts of changing your shave style I highly recommend watching the enormous amount of videos on You Tube.<br /><br />Please understand that using a double edge safety razor will take you 3 times longer to shave with vice the Fusion or the other Gillette blades stated above .  For a newbie it will take around a half hour (the time will reduce once you get used to using this style of shaving).  If your a die hard Gillette fan please understand that Gillette does still have double edge razor blades for sale (they are made and sold by their overseas company) and they used t produce a lot of double edge razors and they still can be found amongst the vintage market.  Good luck I hope my review helps someone.

B00N8332LA|5|The razor has some serious weight to it and feels comfortable in the hand and gliding across the skin; there's a slight downside to the razor in that the blade seems to shift slightly when you close it.  I just carefully hold the ends of the blade while screwing the handle back in place.  The stand is very nice.  Each of the components detach easily for cleaning.  It feels very sturdy and has a nice non slip bottom.  My only complaint about the stand is that the shiny base will catch the occasional drip from the razor and brush and require cleaning every couple of days.  The brush is a genuine badger brush and is a very nice starter brush.  As I am new to wet shaving, this brush seems very good, but as I understand there are much better badger brushes on the market.  Ultimately this kit is an excellent starter kit.  The metal is plated, so it may not last as long as a solid stainless steel razor, but I expect it to last 5-10 years.  Overall I find it to be a bargain and would expect to spend at least $80 on the set if purchased in a brick and mortar store.  If you're new to wet shaving, as I am, I recommend that you pick up a nice sampler set of razor blades.  Many of the sampler packs (even highly reviewed ones) had a bulk of poor blades and all reviewers chose the feather blades, to me this creates a false sense of choice. This set is nice because it has at about four different types of high end blades and you'll notice that many reviewers chose a different blade: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOWZRHY
