B00000K2W1|5.0|Janis Joplin was someone pretty darned special. Like a comet, this gusty blues wailer shot out of Texas in the mid-sixties and racketed onto San Francisco's psychedelic music scene. From there, Miss Joplin vigorously staked her position on the world's stage. This eccentric daydreamer gained a reputation as a boldly distinctive and dynamic performer, a sparkling symbol of flower power, an outspoken trail-blazer for women in rock and definitive testimony that the blues were not strictly race music and that rock and roll was not just a man's game.<br />Because none of her albums were quite faultless, this 1973 greatest hits collection serves as the first stop for all those interested in Janis. It features shining examples of each style she, with her forthright approach and unmistakable raspy, bluesy yowl, made her own: Mo-Town-ish R&amp;B (\\"Piece of My Heart,\\" \\"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\\"), free-wheeling folk (\\"Me and Bobby McGee,\\" \\"Mercedes Benz\\"), sludgy blues (\\"Down On Me,\\" \\"Ball and Chain\\") and darkly-laced, 60s-flavored pop (\\"Get It While You Can,\\" \\"Maybe\\"). These raucous blasts of gritty power truly make the head spin. All you fans of the blues, admirers of the music of the 60s and music fans simply searching for a completely unique and unforgettable experience: Buy this disc and familiarize yourself with a true legend!
B000001AJG|5.0|I was only 10 years old on the album's release date.  After all these years, I too, can still smell the wonderful floral scent of the album jacket.  This album was instrumental in calming me down or changing my mood to a more positive flow after a difficult day.  There is not one song on this album that I dislike.  The Secret Life of Plants is, by far, Stevie's best work.  I lost my copy in a fire four years ago and I am so glad to have found it again.  Thank you Amazon.com for having it in stock.
B000002KHF|4.0|When I bought Van Morrison's Moondance I was only familiar with playful folk-rock singles such as \\"Brown-Eyed Girl\\" and \\"Wild Night\\" and Morrison's reputation as a singer/songwriter somewhere in the same vain of Bob Dylan and Neil Young. When I first played the album I was initially disappointed to hear music closer to Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis than to Dylan or Young. The album's undeniable charm grew on me, though. Songs such as \\"Glad Tidings,\\" \\"These Dreams of You\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\", while not exactly Leonard Cohen, do have their own charming cleverness. Plus, who could resist the starry-eyed, pitch perfect title track? Even the album's instrumentation of fluid saxophones and shimmering pianos I began to find engaging. It's not enough to completely convert me from heavy guitars and mind-blowing lyrics, but for an album as charming and finely crafted as Moondance, I'll allow at least one disc of jazzy crooning into my collection.
B000002UZ1|4.0|Actually the music contained in here is 5 stars, but, as anyone would agree, the problem is production. 1). what is missing: i really love the abbey road medley (where is it?), the white album with only three selections, and abbey road with only four?, (instead of some in here?), and i could go on, but i think you do get my point. 2). the cds still got some space left for music, why didnt they put some beales hits and make it a real 2 cd set, and if not, like i said, the problem its not whats in there, cause its great, the bomer its what its missing( i really love georges the inner light, over some selections here, and, where is it?).  and  like someone said, the sound better in their original context, cause it puts you in one mood, not just a collection of songs. So why de 4 stars?: because, you can put this album, and easily let it sound completley, its all great work. Favorite songs: strawberry fields forever, i am the walrus, lady madonna, hey jude; on cd 2: while my guitar gently weeps ( this is a dream come true: i am a super fan of eric clapton, so to find a track with him playing terrific guitar, with the greatest band ever!, no comments!), the ballad of john and yoko, come togehter, something, let it be, across the universe ( thank you phil spector), the long and winding road ( it is a terrific track, although i like better the anthology 3 version). Geaaaaaat decision to buy it, cause all in there is excellent, but i would have changed some selections.
B000002KCV|4.0|Even on solemn albums like After the Gold Rush and Harvest, Neil Young always fired up his electric guitar for at least one lumbering hard rock song (After the Gold Rush featured \\"Southern Man\\" and Harvest \\"Words\\"). On 1978's Comes a Time, however, Young spends an entire album in folky, sensitive singer/songwriter mode. This light, airy album consists of downbeat deliberation (\\"Human Highway\\" \\"Goin' Back\\"), cuddly odes to love (\\"Already One,\\" \\"Lotta Love\\") and some of Young's best forays into country (The title track, the irresistible \\"Motorcycle Mama\\"). His somber words are gently stirred by the quiet, unadorned accompaniment and his own beautiful acoustic guitar. The angelic backing vocals of Nicolette Larson also help Young settle into an entire album of gentleness.<br />Comes a Time takes a new turn lyrically, as well as musically. Although its two best known songs (The title track and \\"Lotta Love\\") are examples of the uncanny knack Young had long shown for turning universal sentiments into simple, catchy anthems, most tracks on the album feature a new emphasis on lyrical sophistication. Metaphors are a constant on songs like \\"Look Out for My Love,\\" \\"Goin' Back\\" and \\"Field of Opportunity.\\" \\"I come down from the misty mountain/I got lost on the human highway/Take my head refreshing fountain/Take my eyes from what they've seen./Take my head and change my mind/How could people get so unkind,\\" Young sings on \\"Human Highway.\\" Such lines of zealous, symbolic imagery swim through the LP. This colorful lyrical approach is another fine part of the delicate chemistry that makes Comes a Time album so gorgeous.
B00000IQC8|2.0|This is one of those movies that I bought simply because so many people told me how wonderful it was. I've gotta say that even with some funny dialog and good ideas, it doesn't deserve anything close to the credit it gets.<br />The dialog is really what kills this movie. The actors are pretty amateurish, and the delivery of lines is wooden and completely unnatural. The whole movie is based around conversations, and while the actual text of the script is good, the actors don't pull it off.<br />It's pretty easy to make me laugh. But, as this movie stands, it only evoked a few chuckles. Not worth the price tag.
0156421178|5.0|Picture a man in a twilight zone: He has left that uncomfortable and boring, at times deadly experience known as static trench warfare after a sniper's bullet has missed his jugular by a millimeter, and wound up on the run from the local authorities who were now chasing him as a terrorist suspect. Along the way he encounters newspapers which distort the truth and publish outright lies, thus rewriting history, he has to dodge and deceive local police who arrest people against their superiors' wishes and cart them off to secret jails to be eventually shot, and he has to keep his military identity and what unit he belongs to a secret, while keeping his military documents on his person to avoid getting arrested as a deserter. ... this first hand true account was written by a man, who would go on to become a British propagandist during the World War Two and who would lend his name to totalitarian omnipotence, the man is none other than George Orwell.
B000053VAF|5.0|Despite the stupidity of the religious fanatics out there who believe this film to be an exploiting, blasphemous waste of celluloid and Panavision scope, the amazingly insightful and faithful &quot;Dogma&quot; has got to be Kevin Smith's finest hour as a writer and as a director. My mom tried to keep me from seeing this movie based on the opinion of a radically over the top Bible thumper who lives next door. But, you see, like the ridiculous televangelist freaks before her, she had never seen one frame of the film; not even the trailer. Being raised Catholic myself, I know what blasphemy is, and &quot;Dogma&quot; is the farthest thing from it. Smith has actually textured his screenplay with a very deep love for God and everything he has created; he only refutes the word of the church as opposed to the actual word of God, which I believe carries infinitely more weight than the obnoxious rantings of the money-grubbing carnival freakshow acts who began panning this film long before it was even released. But I'm not here to defend Kevin Smith: I'm here to praise this involving, hysterically funny, insightful, comedic race against time that I have come to include in my list of my all-time top ten favorite films.<br />Bartleby (Ben Affleck) and Loki (Matt Damon) are two angels who have been banished to Wisconsin since the Plagues who discover a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow them to reenter Heaven. But there's one catch: By doing so, they would upset the delicately held balance in the universe and destroy existence in the process. With the Almighty mysteriously missing, the powers have no choice but to rely on a sardonic Planned Parenthood worker named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) and two &quot;prophets&quot; dubbed Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) to stop the angels from entering the church with the papel-sanctioned plenary indulgence. Along the way, we meet the long forgotten thirteenth apostle Rufus (Chris Rock, hilarious), a muse with a case of writer's block (Salma Hayek), and James Bondian demon with a devilish agenda (Jason Lee, always terrific).<br />&quot;Dogma&quot; has one of the most diverse and well put together casts I've ever seen in a film. Jay Mewes steals almost every scene with his astounding deliveries; I don't think we'll see him any better than this. And Alan Rickman as the Voice of God, Metatron, supplies some great laughs as well as mystical speeches. Fiorentino provides a strong emotional center to the film, because we can identify with her feelings. Affleck has a hard job of making the biggest emotional change in the film, but we believe him every step of the way. The performances in the film are terrific all around, but the real success of the film lies in the writing, full of details, in jokes, and wonderful originality. Each scene, one after the other, keeps us rolling in the aisles. God helps us if Kevin Smith makes something better and funnier than this. If laughed any harder, I probably would've killed myself. &quot;Dogma&quot; is quite possibly the funniest and most original comedy ever made.f writer's block (Salma Hayek), and James Bondian demon with a devilish agenda (Jason Lee, always terrific).<br />&quot;Dogma&quot; has one of the most diverse and well put together casts I've ever seen in a film.

B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenters, The Fog, is in my opinion, the 70's last great ghost story. If you've ever had the pleasure of visiting Point Ryes, just noth of San Fran, you'd see why a ghost story about Lepers from the sea, betrayel, and murder, is one of the creepiest John Carpenter films ever, in my opinion even surpassing the classic, Halloween.So i can't understand why this is the only John Carpenter film not yet to be released on DVD. I see this film to be in his top three films, so why no DVD. If anybody knows the answer please say so. Thanks
B00003CXXS|5.0|'Jurassic Park III' rocked! And I am an adult, not a child. But this is not the reason why I am writing a review. I am writing a review mainly to point out that one reviewer made a mistake. He was writing a review here for the 'Lara Croft' movie, even though this space is supposed to be for 'Jurassic Park III'. Next time, make sure you're writing a review for the right movie!<br />But the DVD for 'Jurassic Park III' is awesome, and so is the movie. I don't see why so many people hate it! Sure, it's a sequel...but it's a really good one and better than 'The Lost World'. If you loved the first two Jurassic Park movies, then why should you hate this one? Great acting, interesting plot, awesome special effects, and great-looking dinos. The atmosphere of the movie is errie and misty-like...which is cool and perfect for the movie. The characters are likeable, and the storyline keeps your interest. It is non-stop action! The Birdcage scene is great, and the scene where the dinosaur is attacking them in the water is fantastic.<br />This DVD is great, for it has tons of special features like the making of JPIII, behind-the-scenes, cast &amp; crew interviews, the making of the dinosaurs, documentaries, and lots more. For any fan of the trilogy, this DVD is highly recommended.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Baz Luhrman's previous two films, Romeo and Juliet and Simply Ballroom had a lot going for them. They had considerable energy and visual style. Obviously with Romeo and Juliet he also had a good writer. <br />This film however is dreadful. It is little more than an endless video clip. Instead of dialogue a large amount of the communication between the characters is by chanting out pop songs. <br />The plot is one about selfish people. A young play writer whose ambition it is to produce low rent theatrical productions, a actress who wants to move from dance routines to become a serious actress and is willing to sleep with anyone to do it and a theatrical producer who is willing to prostitute around his staff to get funds for an upgrade of his theatre. The moral quality of the characters is enough to make one vomit and the basis of the audiences identification with them is through their physical attractivness.<br />In reality of course with a film like this it is probably ridiculous to talk about the deficiencies of the plot. The heroine for instance suffers from mysterious movie disease. That is a disease that has no real effect on health until the last scene of the film. Prior to that her problem seems to not limit her ability to lead an extremely active life. <br />It is the sort of film which either grabs you because the imagery is beautifull, the pace is frantic and the sets and dancing is okay.<br />However in his previous films although not epic works of the mind seemed to have just a little bit more to grab you. Simply ballroom had less egotistical characters, Romeo and Juliet was based on a piece of our heritage which we all know. This is like watching a Comic Strip without the interlectual depth. <br />I thought Pearl Harbour was the worst film this year till I saw this.
B00005JKT8|2.0|I was really anxious to see this movie because it looked funny and romantic.  Unfortunately, I was dismayed.  Meg Ryan is playing the SAME ROLE AGAIN.  She is incredibly great in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", but in this role she is too old, too whiny, and too stupid for words.  At times, I wanted to tell her to get a grip and grow up. Hugh Jackman was great and I loved the actor who played Kate's brother.  He was actually funny.  The character who was Kate's ex-boyfriend was just mean and not very humorous. Beyond that, there is not too much to say ...
B00003CXTG|1.0|America has without doubt the best film industry in the world. It makes without question the best action films anywhere and in more recent times it has been turning out good films on more serious subjects. <br />This film however is not one of these. It is like a parody of the worst faults that can litter American films. The one redeaming feature is the high quality battle sequences but they only go for about 30 minutes. <br />The film is basically a romance film based on cliches so ancient they haven't dared to raise their head since the 30's. Man meets woman, falls in love and goes to war. Everyone thinks man dies in war, woman takes up with man's best friend. This results in a bit of sexual tension which is resolved rather brutally towards the end. <br />From a historical point of view the film is hopeless. It overates the importance of the Doolittle raid to pander to the nationalism of the American audience. It suggests that American air force personel could drop in to England to fight the Hun for a while and then head back to the states to get into the Japs.From memory didn't joing the armed forces of a country invovle a little more commitment? <br />The most dissapointing aspect however is the artificial and contrinved love story. The dialogue is painful so it rests entirely on the screen magnatism of the leads to create some audience interest. They are physically attractive people but the lines are so deadly the first hour and a half of the film drag dreadfully. <br />Yet this could have been such a great film. The photography is brilliant, the special effects are wonderful and the caste talented. Should have spent more on the writing.
B00005QAPH|5.0|This new Criterion Collection edition of *8 1/2* is one of the best DVD \\"special edition\\" sets I've come across.<br />The Movie:<br />Fellini's breakthrough film is a movie about itself. It is archetypal in the Fellini canon because it both settles old scores and announces a new cinema. The film's hero is an Italian filmaker (Mastroianni as \\"Guido\\" a quasi-alter ego for the director) who has just had his first major hit (=La Dolce Vita). He is not resting on his laurels, however. He is confronted with the necessity of the next movie. This necessity is both personal to the director and apparently contractual: the producer is forever hovering... To Guido, it is an inner necessity, an unrest, a creative suffocation, objectified in the opening sequence of the movie where Guido is seen/not seen by the camera, trapped inside a tiny car that is itself trapped in a traffic jam that stretches endlessly beyond available light as the car fills with toxic gas. We see the as yet unidentified hero in silhouette from behind. We see his hands and feet from outside the car, through the window as he desparately tries to escape. Then, he mysteriously escapes through the car's roof like a new bird escaping its shell and is carried off into the clouds, etc.<br />The trouble is, this is a wish fulfillment dream. In \\"real\\" life, Guido is about to make a movie, and he has no idea what it's going to be about, or what to do with all the actors and extras, and the giant launching pad for some kind of space-ship that is the only thing even close to a concrete idea for the projected picture.<br />The film is not, however, a perfect autobiographical fit. For one thing, Fellini gets to finish his movie and Guido, evidently, does not. But, that said, the movie is a virtual mirror of itself, which was a very hard thing to pull off in 1962, before the concept of \\"virtual\\" was annexed by the codifiers of computer jargon, and *8 1/2* is nothing if not a virtuoso performance. Fellini's breakthrough is the film we watch. But in the film, the hero finds the resolution to his anguish, not in finding the project - that is, in making what would have been the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself within the film-about-itself that we are, finally, watching - but in letting go of the project, in surrendering to the impossibility of finding it or making it. Precisely *on the other side of his own fantasy-suicide*, at the moment when he apparently gives in to despair, he discovers the circle of life and becomes able to join into the procession of lives into which his own life is finally intertwined.<br />So, this is an essential film. And it is a film so rich in texture that a person could watch the movie a hundred times and find new things to wonder at, and discover new connections between the One and the Many - Fellini's personal/existential problem.<br />The DVD:<br />First disc contains a sparkling transfer of the movie that restores a luster to the angular lights and shadows in Fellini's final black & white movie. Audio commentary by a couple of scholars and Fellini's former close accomplice Gideon Bachman.<br />Second disc contains Fellini's famous \\"Director's Notebook\\" of 1968(-9), an hour-long movie that was originally made for television, as well as another documentary about composer Nino Rota, and various interviews, including one with the ever-fiesty Lina Wertmueller who was Fellini's Asst. Director on *8 1/2*.<br />The package also comes with a really interesting little booklet with lots of information and a thoughtful mini-essay.<br />Overall a great package that I'll not regret buying.the film we watch.

0517122707|5.0|A brilliant social satire, Confederacy of the Dunces is about a one-man struggle against mediocrity. The novel is intelligent and hilarious. It is intelligently hilarious and hilariously intelligent.<br />Each character is fully established and so vividly described that you can't be indifferent to any of them. YOu will never forget the intellectually arrogant Ignatius Reilly.He may be fat, slob and ugly but his knowledge of philosophy, to me, warrants his superiority complex.<br />The circumstances behind how the novel got published --the admirable persistence of O'Toole's mother and all ---is itself a moving story. Too bad John Kennedy O'Toole is no longer alive to give us more.
0805062971|5.0|Do not expect to be reading the novelization of the movie.  This is the most important thing that people need to understand when reading this book.<br />Like many people, I was turned on to this book from the movie, but like many people I know, I found the book to be just as enjoyable on another level.<br />The characters were deeper and I gained a better understanding of who they were supposed to be.  For me, some of the best parts of the movie were the deep conversations between the two characters, which we only briefly saw.<br />Keep an open mind when reading this book and you will truly enjoy.

B000002U82|5.0|This is the epitome of 60's acid rock, but it is not PF's best.  For the best you have to listen to Wish You Were Here.<br />This album helped define, and some would argue limit, Pink Floyd as a band.<br />Personally I think it is not only the epitome of acid/space rock but also contributed to almost every industrial rocker from Trent Reznor of NIN to Maralyn Manson.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Her first English CD (and all her other ones) is so great. There are romantic songs, up-beat danceable songs, a tango - in english and spanish, Whenever, Wherever / Suerte(enough said) , and many more. My favorite is her &quot;anti-jerk&quot; song, where she yells at her guy who's been cheatin on her. Buy! Listen!! LOVE!!!
B000002URV|5.0|This is a great album to relax too.<br />It's progresses like a dream, starting slow and relaxing, moving to a nightmarish middle and closing out on a upbeat mood yet wanting more.<br />This was one of the first popular cross genre albums in that it mixed different styles to create a truly different style of album.<br />The success of the album \\"Chant\\" had a lot to do with this album.
078062999X|5.0|Our family's new favorite film! Branagh's performance is absolutely brilliant. It is one of those films you need to watch again and again to get the most out of it. You'll want to read the play, as well, which happily the movie follows. (I detest it when a perfectly great story is slaughtered for film.) The scenery is gorgeous, but the brilliance of Branagh cannot be overstated. Jacobi's Claudius is one you love to hate. Star-studded. It will leave you contemplating more than Shakespeare.
B000005IU2|5.0|With all the criticism surrounding this record and all of the acclaim touting it to be one of the most essential rock records ever, there must be something to this album, right?  With every listen to this album, it just gets better and better.  Sporting a more stripped down sound, Fun House is the sound of the Stooges at their most primal, almost a live sound, produced by Don Galucci of the Kingsmen.  Many who approach this album without any prior knowledge of the Stooges sound may consider it difficult to get into, however with time, it becomes classic.  Building from the opening rants of &quot;Down On The Street&quot; to the apocalypic &quot;LA Blues,&quot; every note played on this album is inspired.  Steven MacKaye's tenor sax gives the music an added cool touch, as well.  Other high points include &quot;TV Eye,&quot; &quot;1970,&quot; and &quot;Fun House.&quot;
B00003CXDV|5.0|this movie isn't as cheesy as it looks! the dialogue can be extremely funny, and the plot is well thought out. Also, the acting is great and the theme song can be pretty catchy.<br />But most importantly, i think this movie has a lot of emotion behind it. you can really see the struggles and humility these aging actors are going through. And the quellek and alaxander scene near the end of the movie was so good it nearly brought tears to my eyes!<br />This doesn't make this movie any less funny though! it's hilarious, then it's serious. a great family movie!
B000005IU1|5.0|Way back in 1969, Iggy Pop (then Iggy Stooge) and his Detroit homeboys created a joyful noise all across the land, a sound that would ultimately influence just about everything, even inadvertantly to present day.  Punk, hard rock, heavy metal, it was all influenced in some way by Iggy and the boys.  This album is a part of an indespensable trio of records, which also includes the follow-up Fun House and 1973's classic Raw Power.  These three records are three of the most important albums ever made.  Each album has a sort of different sound from the other, and this one features production work from John Cale (Velvet Underground) who brings some elements to the table that strangely make the music sound commercial in some spots, and experimental in others.  Classic anthems of alienation and adolescent ponderings, such as &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog,&quot; &quot;1969,&quot; and &quot;No Fun&quot; are now classic rock chestnuts that are reason enough by themselves to pick up this epic album.
6300214559|4.0|I have to admit, although I love the drama of 16th Century England, &quot;Lady Jane&quot; exaggerates the life of Jane Grey. But I won't get into detail, because the movie was was excellent... in the beginning and the end. Parts in the middle left me saying &quot;HURRY UP AND DO SOMETHING!&quot; because of all the sitting and historic talk. It was actually a bit too historic in the dialogue, but too exaggerated in the acted portrayals... But still, the acting WAS carried out beautifully by Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes, and the costume, hair, make-up and music was absolutely classic. I've been trying to find the soundtrack ever since I first saw the movie. Buy the movie today! You'll like it, and you might learn something.
078322687X|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time this ranks in my top 3 of the 80s with the Goonies and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It is a fantastic movie to watch and is just a classic.  When someone I know said they had not seen any of my top three I practically blew up and told them to just get the hell out of the room until they saw the movies! It is a classic and will always be one of my favorite movies to watch!
B00003CXTF|3.0|Although it would be a hasty generalization to say that any movie with two (not one, count 'em - TWO) teen heart-throbs (Ben and Josh) would be a romantic blah-blah-blah of any sort, in this case, it's somewhat true. There are several good scenes in the movie in which the tragedy of Pearl Harbor are portrayed, yet they are overshadowed by the red-herrings of fictional love. You could even say that the whole movie is a red-herring of the bombing of Pearl Harbor solely because it goes off on tangents of the stupid kind. This i find rather cliché because i expected more, but I got less. I gave this movie 3 stars because of my following three contentions.<br />1. The acting-although shallow and vapid, were pretty well done. Cuba Gooding Jr. does a great job and Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett-however aroused I was, deemed great actors all their own.<BR>2. The battle scenes and CGI graphics were superb, as was the score written for them.<BR>3.  ...<br />In conclusion, I would suggest you atleast (or at most) rent this movie. It's not bad, but don't get your hopes up.
0446678430|5.0|This book deserves more than five stars for its exceptional clarity, authenticity, relevance and eloquence.<br />Those who love the Rich Dad, Poor Dad books will adore this one.  I found it to be the best book in the series since Rich Dad, Poor Dad.<br />Mr. Robert T. Kiyosaki speaks with the authority of experience.  He did retire young at 47 while his wife was 37.  At that time, his expected annual income was between $80,000 and $125,000.  Many people yearn for early retirement with wealth, mostly because they hate their work.  Mr. Kiyosaki was soon back at work, establishing new businesses.  Most of his wealth was created after he retired.  \\"I keep working because there are so things that need to be done.\\"  So, he has clearly moved from earnings a living, to living a mission of self-expression.  That's very wonderful, and I hope you will accomplish the same result!<br />Although the subtitle says this is \\"how to\\" book, it's really more of a \\"what to think\\" book.  The fundamental concept is to leverage your mind, your plans, your actions, and your priorities to get wealth faster and more easily.<br />As usual, Rich Dad provides some wonderful quotes.  Here are a few of my favorites.<br />\\"David could beat Goliath because David knew how to use the power of leverage.\\"<br />\\"Cash flow is the most important word in the world of money.  The second most important word is leverage.\\"<br />\\"Leverage is the reason some people become rich and others do not become rich.\\"<br />\\"Because leverage is power, some people use it, some abuse it, and others fear it.\\"<br />\\"Getting rich begins with words and words are free.\\"<br />\\" . . . do more and more with less and less.\\"<br />The first books in the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series have been about cash flow.  This one shifts over to leverage.  Section 1 is about leveraging your mind, section 2 looks at leverage from a plan to retire, section 3 addresses leverage from actions.  The book goes on to give you a final exam on your attitudes and a challenging thought to chew on to help get you focused properly:  making lots of money with no money to start with.<br />Now, any book about leverage would normally have lots of pages on how debt leverage works.  In fact, that is only a small part of what this book talks about.  You will find that discussion in part of chapter 16, which looks at all of the forms of leverage in real estate.<br />One of the strengths of the book is a fine discussion of how to think about risk and reward.  It's not how often you fail, but how big the costs of your failures are compared to the rewards of your successes . . . and your determination to keep trying until you succeed.  For instance, 9 out of 10 new businesses fail.  But the value of the 1 in 10 that succeed should vastly outweigh the costs of the 9 failures.<br />The book is excellent in warning you against the risks that you are unconsciously taking.  Most people have 100% of their financial futures tied up in government pension and Medicare payments and the stock market.  Mr. Kiyosaki correctly points out that this assumption is probably faulty, because there are far more Baby Boomers depending on these two resources than there are resources.  One part of the leverage concept is to have more streams of cash flow.  He also has excellent ideas on how to reduce risk in your current and potential sources of cash flow.<br />You are also given a list of good habits to pursue.  And top tips from the prior books are repeated in a convenient section near the end of the book.<br />If you follow the advice in this book, it will be worth more to you and your family than all the other investment and retirement books that you read combined.  But you have to take action!  Thinking about taking action won't get you there.<br />I would describe this book as being a lot like Tony Robbins's book, Personal Power, except it is focused effectively on the emotional and mental disciples needed for financial security and investing.<br />By theway, I have known many people who have retired young with the assistance of being rich.  They all embody the principles captured in this book.  By contrast, at age 65 only 5 percent of all Americans will be able to afford to live a wealthy life style.  Most will be looking for more income.  Which group do you plan to be in?<br />Think and live the thoughts that will make you as rich as you want to be!  The solutions are there if you look for them.ng.    <br />By the way, I have known many people who have retired young with the assistance of being rich.

B00004Z459|4.0|Why this album is better than other rap-metal albums:<br />1. No cussing. Let's face it, folks, you could live without Limp Bizkit using the f-word 46 times in one song, right? I thought so. These guys are surprisingly clean, but they still cover your basic teen angsts: lonely? check. Dumped by g/f? Check. Good. That's covered.<br />2. Good chemistry among the bandmates is essential. Shinoda and Bennington's timings are impeccable with breaking in and out for singing and screaming and rapping and whatever. The band doesn't have a weird note evident on &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; and even works together well, as evidenced by songs such as &quot;A Place for My Head,&quot; where the guitars and drums and everything else crash together for a sonic-confusion of irresistability. Quite a hybrid theory, indeed.<br />3. Their influence seems to be growing, bigtime. They've sold, what, 8 million copies so far? We'll see if they rival a Hootie and the Blowfish opening or an Alanis opening. Nonetheless, it's an exciting thing for a young band.<br />Anyway, Linkin Park has the ability, the talent, and they don't sink into rap-cliches which screw up the music (in other words, they aren't rollin-rollin-rollin-rollin). I smell sophomore slump, however. We'll see, won't we?
B000002J2F|4.0|Compared with all of the other  Genesis albums I own (and I own many, including the &quot;classic&quot; albums with Peter Gabriel) Duke brings me the most satisfaction as a listener.  It is a rare breed of record, not unlike Rush's Moving Pictures, that works as a progressive album AND a pop album, a work both musicians and more casual music fans can enjoy equally without compromise.  Duke is artistically grand in its scope, accessible in its execution.   It has style with substance, substance with style that sets it apart from most records.   The sprawl of classic art-rock records (&quot;Behind The Lines/&quot;Duchess&quot;/&quot;Guide Vocal&quot; suite) with a grand instrumental excursion (&quot;Duke's Travels/&quot;Duke's End&quot;) that ties the beginning and end together, giving the record somewhat of a &quot;concept&quot; feel.  It boasts concisely arranged AOR radio hits (&quot;Misunderstanding&quot;, &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;), adult contemporary (&quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;), and great symphonic prog pomp in tightly arranged pieces (&quot;Heathaze&quot;, &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot;, &quot;Man Of Our Times&quot;) that could very well have given birth to the &quot;neo-prog&quot; movement a full three years before Marillion was given the credit.    Even though Duke did mark the end of Genesis as a &quot;progressive&quot; band, this is a great step forward in many areas.  And that is a TRUE definition of progression:  moving forward.  The production is much improved over any Genesis record to this date (1980).  Previous records, such as And Then There Were Three...(1978) and Wind And Wuthering (1977) suffered from thin production value, so much that you began to wonder:  Where is the BAND?  On Duke, everything is brought further to the front, especially the &quot;wide-open&quot; sound of Phil Collins's drums, soon to become an identifying trademark.  Collins is in fine vocal form here, likely because you feel he is not straining to be heard.  Tony Banks's keyboards provide an otherworldly atmosphere to the tracks, especially the haunting chorused electric piano segue into &quot;Duchess&quot;, the grace and pomp of &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot;, and the grandeur of &quot;Duke's Travels/Duke's End&quot;).  Mike Rutherford moves forward as a guitarist here, providing the right textures in his inspired parts.  Plus, you can actually hear the bass this time,  which sorely lacked on the last two records.  There is a bit of a murkiness to the overall production, but it actually serves the downcast nature of the material well, giving the songs an irrepressible aura that appeals for continued listening and absorption into one's soul.        The only flaw here songwise is &quot;Alone Tonight&quot;, which just comes off as overblown and tepid.  The emotion feels so forced here that the song has no real soul, especially when compared with the other ballad &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;, which is much more genuine and meaningful.  This proves, in light of Collins's marital problems at the time, that sometimes the best songs do come from real life.  You can really FEEL him pouring out everything in his heart and soul here, and it's REAL.       So, for that one flawed song, I cannot quite give Duke a 5 star rating. I do wish I could give it 4 and half, because it does deserve more than 4.  My personal favorites here (although all other 11 tracks are good) are &quot;Behind The Lines&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Heathaze&quot;, &quot;Cul-De-Sac&quot;, and &quot;Duke's Travels/Duke's End&quot;.  A further recommendation, and somewhat similar  soundwise, is A Curious Feeling, a Tony Banks solo record that came out the year before this, which proves that he is an outstanding writer even outside the band context.
B00005JKES|1.0|I, too, sat down to watch &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; for the first time and was seriously annoyed to hear &quot;Previousy on Twin Peaks...&quot;  I am sending mine back for a refund. When my friends watched this years ago, many complained of being frustrated.  That must be the producers goal.  They've succeeded in doing it again all these years later.  And only 3 seconds into the DVD!!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I know &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is just a movie, but it's my favorite movie, and I feel the need to defend it against all the people who are dissing it so hatefully.  I've seen it described here as &quot;sophomoric,&quot; &quot;pretentious,&quot; and &quot;the worst movie ever.&quot; This is mostly from people who &quot;couldn't stand it&quot; and turned it off after less than an hour.  How could you people possibly make such a definitive judgement on a film you didn't even watch? If this is the worst movie you've ever seen, you obviously don't know anything about film.  <br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the most invogarating, satisfying, refreshing cinematic experience I have ever had.  It's beautiful in it's SIMPLICITY.  Yes, we've seen the story a million times...but never presented in this manner.  The film is amazing...a true feast for the eyes and ears.  It surely required an incredible amount to creativity and imagination (something so lacking in films these days).  And the emotional impact is intense.  The actors put their all into their roles.  Never have I seen performances approached with such abandon.  Ewan McGregor deserves an Academy Award for this film.  <br />More than angry, I feel sorry for people who don't like this movie.  How jaded and cynical they must be.  (Or maybe they're just stupid, and prefer pointless dreck like &quot;The Fast and the Furious.&quot;)  The film has brought me so much joy, and will continue to do so for a very long time.  Here is my suggestion to those who did not like it:  Please give it another chance.  First, rent Baz Luhrmann's previous films, &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; and &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet.&quot;  This will give you an idea of his unique style.  Then, for godsakes, open your minds a little and watch &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; again.  I assure you, it gets better every time you see it.<br />What could possibly be so awful about a movie that celebrates TRUTH, BEAUTY, FREEDOM, and LOVE?  Aren't those the thingsthat really matter in life?
B00003CX5P|1.0|I waited so long for this movie, and was seriously disappointed.  Being a true SciFi fan probably taints my opinion.  Episodes 4-6 were excellent, especially 4 &amp; 5.  If you really liked Episode 1, and there are no other DVD's that you would rather spend your money on, this DVD has some nice extra's.  (Got it as a gift.)  I have seen it twice, which is more than enough times for me.  My six year old nephew does not even like it.  He would rather watch Spy Kids or see Harry Potter.

0525457585|5.0|\\"The book of books!\\" This quote from The Neverending Story says it all, as I've never come across another book like it! Its engrossing plot (told using two different colors of ink in hardcover editions!) follows the story of poor unwanted Bastian Balthazar Bux (printed in red) who is \\"found\\" by a copper-colored, silk-bound book, titled The Neverending Story, which he begins to read while locked up in his school's attic. As Bastian reads the story of the heroic Atreyu (printed in green) and a Great Quest to save his dying world of Fantastica and its Childlike Empress, he has no idea that he is also a character in a book! (It makes you wonder, huh?) The Neverending Story is filled with unbelievably imaginative characters such as Grograman the Fire Lion, the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, Querquobad the Silver Sage, and Ygramul, \\"the horror of horrors!\\" to name just a handful! And not only are the characters and plot creative, but the book itself is as well! It is printed entirely in colored ink as I have mentioned, plus it has 26 chapters - each one beginning with a letter of the alphabet! Each chapter begins with a magnificent illustration (also in only red and green ink in the hardcover edition) around the first letter! How did he think of that?! But perhaps the best thing about The Neverending Story is what you get out of it. You cannot read it without looking at the nature of wishes, imagination, and love differently from that point forward, no matter what your age is. The Neverending Story is, as you shall see, your story as well. And that of course (to quote the book again,) \\"shall be told another time!\\"
0812550706|5.0|this is a great science book in the world. i usually hate science fiction books, but this is an exception. my friend introduced me to these books and a week later i had boughten the whole series! they're really freat!
B00005R2IS|5.0|I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration.  The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack.  Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters.  The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.  <br />The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more. <br />The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen.  Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan &amp; scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action.  If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'
B000051Y0G|4.0|I originally bought this CD for &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot;, and &quot;Time After Time&quot;, but after listening to it the whole way through I found that those aren't the only &quot;worth-while&quot; tracks on here. Actually, &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; has become one of my favorites on the album. It takes a feel good melody and puts it against somewhat sad lyrics. I also love &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, Cyndi sounds great on it and, well, it's just a good song. &quot;She Bop&quot; is also a fun one to listen to. If you're a girl, or a guy, who just wants to have fun-buy this CD, it's great, period.
B00005RYKU|2.0|THE GLASS HOUSE is about a girl and her brother and they get adopted by their neighbours because their parents died in a car accident. Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby (that girl) and she's your typical high school student. After Ruby and her brother move in with their new guardians (the Glasses) they start to notice some weird things about them. That's all i'm saying about the plot. THE GLASS HOUSE is suprisingly bland. It offers no suspense, a mediocre storyline, predictable plot -- shall I go on? It was boring OK! It could've been a &quot;made for TV movie&quot; or one that goes straight to video. It should be collecting dust on the shelves soon.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is one of the funniest movie I have ever seen. The comedy just keeps comeing! I couldn't stop laughing! It was the best! Everyone from 2 through 202 will love it, you must buy it, you'll love it. Incase you don't know i'll give you a quick review...  A big green org (who's name is Shrek) has a very peaseful life living alone in his swamp untill the king Farkwa banashes all the magical creaters to his swamp. Including a talking donkey. Shrek makes a deal with Farkwa that if he resques Princes Fiona from an evil dragon he will get his swamp back. The donkey comes with him and proves to be a big help. He resques her but they end up falling in love! There is a suprise ending too so i won't give it away but you will like it. It's the kind of movie that 3 generations call all watch together and all love. I highly highly recomend it! BUY IT TODAY!
0788812408|5.0|The Little Mermaid from Hans Christian Andersen is one of my favorite fairy tales and even though Disney changed the story and the ending of the fairy tale to give it a more happy Disneyish ending I still really loved this animated movie and thought it was such a nice, sweet, charming movie and I really liked Ariel, also I loved the songs especially Under The Sea! I reccomend this animated movie and also the Faerie Tale Theater version of The Little Mermaid starring Pam Dawber as the Mermaid, it was much closer to the classic Andersen tale and it kept the scary part with the Mermaid and the knife and the sad ending.
B00004XONN|2.0|I say a video show a while back that devoted their half hour to all videos of &quot;Radiohead&quot;. Most of them were from &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. I watched it because I was curious about the group and their music. I bought &quot;Amnesiac&quot; first because there were more songs I liked from that album then &quot;Kid A&quot;. I thought that this would be just as good, but I was really disapointed. There's only four really good songs on this album in my opinion. <BR>&quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;, &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot;, <BR>&quot;Optimistic&quot;, and &quot;In Limbo&quot;. Eveything else didn't seem like a song to me, just attempts at ones. &quot;Morning Bell&quot; isn't bad, but I liked the version on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; better. If your new to &quot;Radiohead&quot;, I'd suggest getting &quot;Amnesiac&quot; before this one.
6300274187|5.0|Mary Poppins is not only one of my favorite Disney movies but also one of my favorite movies period, I think this movie is fantastic and just a real joy to watch, I like it a lot more than Chitty Chitty Bang! I highly recommend Mary Poppins! I wish they would also release the Gnome Mobile to video and DVD it was a really cute movie that also starred Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber who played Jane and Michael in Mary Poppins, we used to have the Gnome Mobile on tape it was tape off of The Disney Channel but unfortunately it was taped over.
B00005QCYC|5.0|Universal has really done a commendable job with this set of film classics.  I'm not going to critique the individual films in depth.  Briefly, I like the first film- holds up to repeat viewings.  The second film was turdheimer, there wasn't enough new dino-creatures (but it does have it's share of nausea-inducing scenes).  The third one is the best!
0060012331|4.0|Once upon a time there were rats who ate a little too much from rubbish heap behind the Wizards' university. They were Changed, and learned to think, to talk and, later on, to develop a conscience. They named themselves after things they saw in the rubbish, perhaps a little before they knew what the words meant. Pratchett is a good enough writer that rats like Dangerous Beans, Peaches, Darktan, Hamnpork and Donut Enter are a lot more vivid and believable than 9/10ths of what passes for literature today.<br />Maurice is a cat, and he is also Changed, although he really doesn't like to talk about how it happened. But he's always careful now to ask his food if it can talk before her eats it. He's the brains behind the scam.<br />Together with the stupid-looking kid who plays the flute - his name is really Keith - the rats and Maurice work the pied piper scam. For a modest fee, Keith can get rid of the sudden plague of rats that afflicts a town. And what with rats widdling in the flour and tap-dancing on the kitchen counter - there's always someone who wants to be in theater - the town is always grateful when Keith successfully pipes the rats away.<br />Until they arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. The traps are worse, the poisons more lethal and the rat catchers more ingenious than anywhere else. And there is something really evil living lower down, under the rat tunnels. Something that hates. Something that takes you over.<br />Pratchett has called this a children's book, but it would be more accurate to say it was based on a children's book. It's really about myths and the role of myths, and what it means to be \\"human.\\" As just one example, the rats drag along with them a collection of children's fairy tales, remarkably like Peter Rabbit, and think it's a reference book for humans. The Pied Piper of Hamlin, of course, is itself a fairy tale. With (or perhaps despite) the \\"help\\" of Malicia, the Mayor's daughter and the granddaughter and grand niece of the Sisters Grim, the rats, Maurice and the stupid-looking kid must learn the hard way that if you aren't making up your own story, then you're just a character in someone else's.<br />Fun and thought-provoking, if somewhat different than the usual Pratchett novel. Recommended.the rats, Maurice and the stupid-looking kid must learn the hard way that if you aren't making up your own story, then you're just a character in someone else's.<br />Fun and thought-provoking, if somewhat different than the usual Pratchett novel.

0451204530|3.0|Ken Follett does an excellent job at gaining the readers attention in the first couple of pages in &quot;Code to Zero&quot;.  Once you start it, you'll find it's a quick, easy read.  Follett moves the story along at a nice pace.  However, if you're in the market for something out of the ordinary, you won't find it here.  Although one might argue that the characters are well developed, they are ho-hum individuals with little or no personality.  I can't recall one good line from the entire book.  Good news for those hunting for mindless entertainment, you've hit pay dirt!
B00005QIPH|4.0|The vocal of 'Last Night' is like a distorted recorded Bono singing a Stooge tune.  There are definite 60's and 70's alternative influences, which is refreshing.  Some of the delivery of the material is reminiscent of the Velvet Underground.  Nothing wrong with that.
0156012197|5.0|I recently read this edition aloud to my eight-year-old twins, and they were completely captivated by the simple story of the a little prince from a tiny planet who finds himself in the desert befriending a downed pilot.<br />After reading aloud four action packed, magical volumes of Harry Potter, I assumed this classic would seem pale by comparison. Never underestimate the taste of your children! Feed their  brains the best literature you can find that they are capable of understanding, and watch them grow as readers and human beings. My children loved the story, identified with the little Prince's disdain for the hurried, goal-oriented perspective of adults, and understood the notion of &quot;taming&quot; another living creature as a metaphor for forming emotional ties.<br />At this age, they are at the cusp of discovering that literature can convey meaning at several levels, and to share the excitement of this process with them is a joy. There are many wonderful classics to share with your children, and this is one of them.
B00005NGAG|5.0|I saw this movie with a little hesitation. I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I had read sounded all too interesting. And from the beginning, I was completely enjoying it.<br />The dark comedy stars Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Chain Reaction) and Susan Lynch (Waking Ned Devine) as two women trapped in bad relationships. The two meet by accident, when Dorothy (Lynch) stumbles across Petula (Weisz) being beaten by her boyfriend. As the boyfriend begins choking Petula, Dorothy realizes she must help her. Acting on instinct, Dorothy grabs a large pipe and whacks the man in the head. The two take the unconscious man back to Dorothy's apartment. There, the two introduce themselves. When the boyfriend wakes up, he falls from the bathtub (where Petula and Dorothy had placed him for the time being) he bangs his head. Now Petula and Dorothy have a dead body to deal with. Not just some man either. Petula's boyfriend is the younger brother of a very wealthy and very powerful man. Determined to shift the blame away from themselves, (accident  or not) the two conceive a plan not only to get off scotch free, but to get some money in the process, demanding a ransom from the older brother. But problems only get worse for the two. When the ransom is stated, the two now have to dodge a sneaky detective fond of Petula, Dorothy's druggie boyfriend, a severed finger and a very scary older brother!<br />I found myself thoroughly entertained. Weisz is absolutely superb as Petula. Not quite the brightest crayon in the box, she adds a lot of comic relief. Her abilities are definitely NOT limited to mummy flicks.<br />Lynch is perfect as Dorothy. I had seen Waking Ned Devine, but had not heard much of Lynch sense, but she was great. She's believable in her acting and I thought no one could play Dorothy better.<br />The movie has feeling of &quot;Thelma and Louis,&quot; minus the road trip. I found myself laughing through the movie, moved by Petula and Dorothy's self-struggles to stay with their boyfriends, and on the edge of my seat with a very thrilling and unpredictable plot. I would definitely recommend the movie to anyone who liked Pulp Fiction, or, of course, Thelma &amp; Louis.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I recieved the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; for Christmas this year. This is a very good movie but I warn you it does take a few times to really understand and grasp the whole plot and fully appreciate this movie. This movie is full of digital effects, but they are not overused as they are in some movies. The digital effects are perfectly excecuted. The main character &quot;Maximus&quot; is played by Russell Crowe, who in my opinion did a good job of acting out the illustrious personality of Maximus. He did a good job changing the personality of Maximus as he was in different situations. There where points in the movie when Maximus was a reverant man, and other points where he was a cold blooded killer. <br />Joaquin Phoenix, brother of River Phoenix, played the evil Roman emperor Commodus. Joaquin did a good portrayal of the emperor, who is known in the history books to probably have been insane and obsessed with gladatorial sport. He bankrupted the Roman treasury by spending all his money of uneccesary things having to do with sport. Some also say he was the emperor who started the downfall of the Roman Empire. Joaquin did a great job in my opinion, and his portraying of the Commodus was mostly accurate to the history books.<br />Now some naysayers have said it was impossible for the Emperor to have ever fought in the Colosseum. Well, I have researched  the Roman Empire and Commodus often appeared in the Colossuem to fight poorly armed gladiators who had only wooden weapons and no armor, while the Emperor has metal weapons and was well armed. There where many other stipulations in the Emperors favor, and I am sure he would get a little &quot;help&quot; if the battle was not going his way. The real Commodus also appeared in chariot races, but he never raced in the Circus Maximus because he did not like to do it in public.<br />There where a few small plots in this movie that did not conform with history, such as the fact the Marcus Aurelias probably did not have anyproblem with Commodus becoming the new emperor after he died. However, this is a great movie, and it is well acted and has a great plot. It might not be able to satisfy the regular history buff, but it can satisfy the normal American, which is what has made this such a great film. The directing, the acting, the digital effects, it is all here in this one, so I would reccomend you buy this DVD immediately.
B000008LOV|5.0|Proven test of time! I dare anyone to try and burn out this CD!<br />A friend and I have played and played this CD over again for years, and it holds up better than any other I've known!!!<br />...See what I mean!
B00005N9CV|3.0|It was truely good marketing, but there isn't anything in the media that's not about marketing but that alone, talent still counts.  Diana Krall is a talented singer with a very good voice, she executes fine inflections and phrasings but not passionate enough.  I do agree that her real forte lies with the piano and we don't get to hear alot in this album, but sometimes, too much of something that's good can kill.  So give her a break, she's taking a detour that's all, on the overall the album's great for any starters in Jazz.  The sleek production is intoxicating...Al Schmit really knows how to record an album, Diana must owe part of her success to this world class engineer.  I am sure Diana's voice was recorded just the way it was supposed to be, it's Schmit's trademark not to make too many alterations to the original signals.  For any audiophiles or vocal afficionados, this album is a must have but as for real jazz, her past albums did greater justice, you'll really be enthralled by her piano.  Last but not least, stop comparing her to legends, Diana is really unique in her own sense, I would say at least half a million people who bought her albums think so and probably many years down the road, she'll be another legend.

This is simply an outstanding CD. &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot;, &quot;Older&quot;, &quot;Spinning the wheel&quot; and &quot;To be forgiven&quot;... And that's not even all of it! I love this type of music after just discovering it recently. It's a shame George probably won't be doing anything else. This is definite chill out, reflection music.
B00003CXTG|1.0|If you are looking to see a modern day picture about the attack on Pearl Harbor - Don't see this.  Historically this picture gives you nothing until the last 40 minutes, which that is even wrong.  This movie is a love story and nothing else.  If you want to find out what happen in the day's before the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor - &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; is the movie to see, plus numerous books.  My rating would have been a negative if it was a option...
B00005QK3W|1.0|Paul has never needed the bite and cynical wit of John Lennon more than now.  There are lovely bits of melody that float in and out of every song making it sound as if McCartney has too many melody lines with nowhere to put them.  For sure, he has no lyrics to pair them with in this very trite, very silly bunch of songs.  Each one has thirty seconds of greatness paired with two and a half minutes of balderdash!  Get a lyricist, Paul, or a backyard critic to toughen you up!  Too much sum with absolutely no substance. What a great disappointment for lovers of the man's previous work.  Come on, Paul!  Get back to where you used to be!  We're waiting for you!
B00005A46T|1.0|While the first CD had some awesome songs with excellent parts for every insrtument, this CD just doesn't keep it going. I only have this CD to listen to the Drummer Joey because he is good. I suggest getting the selfnamed CD Slipknot, but do not get Iowa.
6305364648|3.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those names interchangable with action movies. I've never seen him star in anything that wasn't filled with violence and mindless plots, save Terminator and T2, which did have a great story. 'True Lies' is nothing different than the rest of his work: thin plot, thin characters and enough bullets flying to think you're actually in a war. <br />In this movie, Arnold is attempting to stop a massive terrorist attack on America, which includes nukes, of course. However, there is a catch: his wife has no idea he's a spy and believes he is a simple computer salesman. When she is pulled into the story, the action thickens and we're given fight after fight until we forget the plot that seemed tacked on. <br />Tom Arnold provided some comedic relief to this film, as did Bill Paxton as a spy-wannabe, probably the best part of the film overall. <br />So here's the basics of this film: If you're into Arnold movies, rent it and watch it; it's not so bad. If you're like me and can barely stand his poor attempt at dialogue, you might want to look elsewhere for an action flick with a plot that is a little more sound. I recommend 'The Rock' with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. <br />All in all, not a bad movie, but nothing great. Probably one of his funnier films. It would've been better if the film didn't come to such a quick and perfect ending, but who am I to say anything: It's Schwarzenegger!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I was already convinced about Robbie Williams' talent since &quot;Rock DJ&quot; video and his magnificent performance of Queen's &quot;We are the champions&quot;, but &quot;SWING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING&quot; is really a gem. We are lucky that, from time to time, there is a talent big enough on rock to switch into other styles and refresh and render life into classic songs as those compiled on this CD.  A real tribute to an era and their krooners (here, Williams became another one), and to the magic of singing.<br />As a bonus, we have such talents as Nicole Kidman's (what an artist!), Rupert Everett (so classy), Jon Lovitz, Jane Horrocks and Jonathan Wilkes (what a duo!).<br />Never think it twice: put this CD on your collection because it worth to be there. A collector masterpiece!
0385495323|5.0|This is the most thorough and enjoyable book I've read on the history of cryptography.  It's such an easy and captivating read, as entertaining as any novel.  Singh also details the creation of public key cryptography and RSA ciphers.  Included toward the end of the book is the idea of quantum computers.  A must read.  Also check out Singh's other book, on Fermat's Enigma!
B00004XONN|3.0|This is the best acid jazz album I've heard since Vanilla Ice's &quot;To The Extreme,&quot; that itself a profound tribute to Uncle Meat by the Mothers of Invention, with a little more keyboard. When I heard &quot;How To Disappear Completely,&quot; I was severely disappointed because they never told me how to disappear. I thought they had the answers, but instead I heard about how isolation consumes people. I already knew this. Overall, a good follow-up to the jungle funk of &quot;OK Computer.&quot; Their forays into psychedelic bluegrass on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; were much more surprising. I'm gonna go listen to Tusk now.
B00005MP58|5.0|I just watched it on A&amp;E over Christmas vacation.  At first, I didn't really expect anything from the film, but after watching it, I fell in love with Colin&amp;Jennifer.  I read the book in high school, and I used to like Jane Eyre better, but now my admiration toward Jane Austen is exceedingly high.  I didn't have VHR or DVD, therefore it's a torture waiting for the next series.  Before watching the movie, I honestly don't know who Colin or Jennifer, but now I sure would like to see more of them in similar roles.
B00004S6GL|4.0|This album is great. Elliott Smith writes great songs. Elliott Smith has two t's in his first name. He plays great guitar. That's all. Great songwriter. God? No. Beatle? No, wrong decade. Singer? Yes. Songwriter? Yes. God? No. Thank you. I'm gonna go listen to Tusk now.
B000021Y74|5.0|Let me first say that I am anything but a movie person. I hate movies. Watching them is like a chore. However, after just watching this movie lastngiht, it has changed how I look at movies. This movie has got to be one of the best, if not the best out there. I've never even heard of it since lastngiht, and I'm already obsessed with it!!  I'm very jelous of this film, I wish i had come up with this idea. If you love action packed movies, with *AWESEOM* techno music, then this movie is for you.. you won't regret it!!
B00000373U|5.0|Okay, here's the deal with Elliott Smith. There's nothing new to him. There's nothing he does, be it the Beatlesque melodies, the Arlo Guthrie fingerpicking, the Nick Drake lyrics melding anguish with cynicism-- there is nothing he does that hasn't been done before. That's not the point. Elliott Smith is not a living genius, nor is he destined to change the face of pop music as we know it (if anything, he's destined to remind us of how incredible it can be). But he is a damn good songwriter, and &quot;either/or&quot; is his best record.<br />Basically, this is a great album. It's not quite as downbeat as the previous &quot;Elliott Smith;&quot; while it gets pretty heavy there's nothing like &quot;Needle In The Hay&quot; to really depress you. Instead, Smith adopts sort of a sly sense of humor on some of his songs, particularly &quot;Rose Parade,&quot; which when viewed in one light is absolutely hysterical. He also seems to be viewing love a little more on the bright side, in &quot;Say Yes&quot; (though even that has an unfortunate, but perfectly natural spin). The melodies are all very simple, usually repeated two-bar phrases before the chorus, but they're great melodies, showcasing Smith's delicate tenor, and also focusing attention to the lyrics (no small feat, especially when he practically whispers half his lines).<br />The best moments are when Smith lets his guard down a little, like &quot;Between The Bars,&quot; or &quot;Cupid's Trick.&quot; Other than the Penny Lane shuffle of &quot;Pictures Of Me&quot; and the mild stroll of &quot;Ballad Of Big Nothing,&quot; the album is quite low-key. No big surprises, no gallant orchestras, just some great songs.<br />And all in all, this is one of my all-time favorite records. Every song is consistent enough to stand on its own, yet they all fuse so well together. There's nothing too thematic, or grandiose, and I could definitely cite albums that had a greater emotional impact when I first heard them, but this is justa very, very solid collection of teriffic songs. It showed Smith was still progressing as an artist and still had a really good way to go (and we got to experience all of it!). His subsequent two releases have been much more studio-oriented, with expansive arrangements, more complex melodies, and orchestrations that would make Brian Wilson proud; and it is true, some of the intimacy, the living-room-guy-with-a-guitar sound has been lost. But that's okay, because there's still &quot;either/or,&quot; which is still my favorite. You won't be disappointed.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Being a long-time fan of Shakira's, as well as a native bilingual, I admire Shakira's musical talents a great deal, especially her original vocal interpretations and lyrics.  What I find most interesting about her latest album, however, is not the album itself (which is very solid, given that Shakira learned an entirely new language in order to record it, and composed the bulk of its songs by herself...) no, what's interesting is how many listeners who openly profess to have no previous knowledge of her recordings and/or Latino music in general are reviewing her album based on her \\"accent\\" in English.  Would it not be fair to say that we *all* have an \\"accent\\" when we speak?  And since when is Spanish inherently \\"easier\\" to learn, while English is somehow \\"harder\\"?  (What might we- albeit unintentionally- be saying about the people who speak these languages?)       In all seriousness, there's more to music than language preference- even though in the U.S. (unlike most other countries) commercial success seems to depend on the artist's command of U.S. English...what does that say about the typical U.S. consumer?       Once more:  let's give Shakira credit for the work that went into this album, like the album or not (though I would recommend \\"Donde estan los ladrones?\\" as a whole over this album anyday.)
630589938X|1.0|I'll cut to the chase....Plot ..., movie ..., not scary, will put horror fans to sleep...BAD MOVIE!
B000001FOL|3.0|Nico has a very interestingly different voice. In fact, I really disliked her voice for a long time, but there is something about it that makes me want to come back for more. This album is quite a pleasant listen, with both high and low points. The high points are the songs written by Jackson Browne (3 of them, 2 of which are featured in the movie The Royal Tennenbaums), the Dylan cover I'll Keep It With Mine (better than the original), and Lou Reeds song Chelsea Girls. However, soome of the songs are quite boring and give the album an uneven feel. Among these are It Was A Pleasure Then, Eulegy To Lenny Bruce, and Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams.<BR>If you like Jackson Brown and The Velvet Underground, and are not totally put off by Nico's voice, then you will probably enjoy this album. Otherwise look elsewhere.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Anyone who's had to work for a living might relate to this film and will feel comforted that other mortals suffer emotional turmoil like we do at work.<BR>The action centres around four struggling real estate salesmen, driven to the edge through their struggle to close weak sales leads. That is all but one of them - the slick and cheesy Ricky Roma (played by Al Pacino).<BR>Following poor sales their employer Rio Rancho brings in a Hot Shot salesman (Alec Baldwin) from the parent company Mitch and Murray to deliver a pep talk and an ultimatum. This scene sets the tone for the film and is both fierce and witty. Whilst the main focus of the film is on the sales leads-which incidentally ARE WEAK, this film runs deeper. The dialogue in Mamet's screenplay is razor sharp and full of pace. It is the calibre of the actors however, that make this film. All are awesome and I understand, many agreed to perform for a vastly reduced fee, simply because the script was so strong.  Each of them delivers a performance that is impeccable in both timing and conviction, and as the plight of each character unfolds you find yourself getting drawn deeper into the intriguing drama. <BR>Put simply if you enjoy formulaic Hollywood films containing all the usual ingredients- romantic interest, car chase, over sentimentalism or an ending in a disused gas works then this is not for you. If however you enjoy rapid clever dialogue, black humour and the joy of seeing so many great actors working together and enjoying it, then Glengarry Glenross is a must see.
B000002MFN|3.0|I love Madonna.  She is my idol.  However, 1992's &quot;Erotica&quot; is definitely not her best album.  While it's easy to say that she simply wanted to shock people, &quot;Erotica&quot; does contain a lot of personal lyrics.  Most of them are about indulging fantasies and fulfilling lust.  Yet at the same time, it's also some of Madonna's most shallow work.  Who else can explain the lyrics to &quot;Where Life Begins&quot;, in which Madonna sings about &quot;dining out DOWN THERE&quot;?  Hmm...interesting.  This album also contains a major stinker in the form of &quot;Did You Do It?&quot;, in which two guest singers rap over Madonna's lyrics.  It's awful.  &quot;Erotica&quot; does have some gems, though.  The title song is sultry and haunting; &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot; has a great dance beat to it with a clever chorus; and &quot;Rain&quot; is a beautiful, swelling ballad.  Certainly nowhere near as good as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; or &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot; is an okay album to have if you are a Madonna fan.  It's length is just over 75 minutes, and it's not a comfortable listen.  But the album's high points can generally make it worth the listen in the end.
B00005QDW5|5.0|As mentioned in the title I believe that this 2 CD set is perfect for any new Pink Floyd fans out there.  I would say it contains all the great songs you constantly hear on the radio and can tell you a bit of what the band is about.  However, I do believe that there are one or two songs on here from their earlier work that,in my opinion, could have been replaced by some other more worthy songs.  I mean, you can't exactly call it the best if not all the songs are all that great.  I also was somewhat let down when I noticed that one of my personal favorites was not on here which is &quot;Goodby Blue Skies&quot;.  Of course, it isn't that well known so I guess it was to be expected.  Of course, you'll notice that regardless of my problems with this CD I still gave it five stars and that is because although there were two songs on it that really got on my nerves I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who love hearing Floyd's earlier stuff.  Besides, all the other spectacular songs on this set more than made up for it.
6301963717|5.0|All the 5 star reviews you see here given by movie lovers on this gem are no accident. I won't spend time being redundant except to say this. I own approximately 500 DVD's and if this were available on DVD and in my collection it would be in the top 5 easy. I went with a good friend to see in this movie when it was released in 1990 because the trailer looked so breathtaking. We were shocked at how great a film this truly was. To attempt to draw some perspective for you I will breakdown my movie tastes to show you that while I like a good drama it is not the tops on my genre preference list. My movie tastes go roughly in this order. 1) Horror 2) Horror-Sci-Fi 3) Gangster Drama 4) Action 5) Sci-Fi 6) Drama 7) Comedy. This film had to leap two of my favorite genre categories to get into my overall top 5, very tough indeed. Nothing really left to say except this is an absolute must own if you are a true movie enthusiast. From the music, cast, dialogue, cinematography, wardrobe and story you can't find a better film regardless of genre. I only hope that with all that is coming out on DVD that this jewel won't get left behind. With a ton of luck we can all hope for a DVD release with Director/Producer/Cast commentary, DTS 5.1 Audio mix, Original Aspect Ratio, THX video transfer and heck why not throw in a making of documentary and the trailer for thrills (hey I can still dream). For now though I'll have to be content with my old, beat up VHS copy.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Not many people could pull off venturing out and exploring their true musical talents instead of following industry advice. Pink does an amazing job on this album. I enjoyed her first album hits but I can identify with the raw, emotional, and passionate aspects of this album. If you are expecting pure R&amp;B, think again! This album is rock/dance/R&amp;B all rolled into one. You won't be dissapointed!
B00005QFE5|5.0|THE ROAD HOME&quot; is one of the most wonderful and beautiful films I ever seen. I'm not really into chinese movies, mainly because they are slow, but I took a chance with this one and saw it. I have to say that I absoultely loved it. But it is very sad at the end, so it wouldn't be one I'd want to own. But definately one to check out. It's kind like owning &quot;TITANIC&quot; and &quot;PEARL HARBOR&quot;. Do you really want to watch a disaster over and over? I'm not saying there's a big disaster in this movie, but hopefully you'll get what I mean. <BR>Anyways...The main point about the movie is that it is so simple that it takes your breath away. The love story is small and epic at the same time. You can really tell the two are in love. It's so real. Zhang Ziyi, from Crounching Tiger, is wonderful as a poor peasant girl in love with the new village school teacher. The actual story of how their love unfolded is so tender and sweet that it will leave you trying to hold back tears of pure joy. The music, composed by San Bao works so well with the movie, it's outstanding. <br />Enjoy!
B00005QDW1|5.0|this goes out to all of you (as a friend would say) elitist punk a$$holes!  No Doubts latest release, Rock Steady is a great album.  It isn't repetitive and yes, its not like Beacon Street or the self-titled but evolution happens to people who arent &quot;elitist punk a$$holes&quot;!!  Early No Doubt fans accused No Doubt of selling out when Tragic Kingdom came out, but thats what attracted most of you.  Back to the music-- its a flashback to the eighties that blends reggae, pop, electronica and the ballad.  People open up your eyes and appreciate the inspired lyrics and different sounds!!
B00005O5JV|4.0|Walking through the aisles of the video store on a Friday night is not an exciting adventure when most of the movies are gone.  Looking at the rows of empty boxes, the remaining videos were surely second-rate.  The mood at the moment was for an exciting thriller, until the one desired was gone as well.  Glossing over the remainder of misfits, LEGALLY BLONDE was still in stock.  Reaching up to take the movie, I quickly withdrew it with the notion that possibly someone had returned the one I really had a hunkering to see.  However, the idea was shot down as the clerk said, &quot;Sorry sir.&quot;  With all the resolve one could muster, the hand shaking as though it was working against its master, once again reached for LEGALLY BLONDE.<br />Darn it!  Those first impressions are not always right, you know, thinking this movie was CLUELESS II.  It was much more than a dumb blonde movie, but remarkably a refreshing 'you can do anything you set your mind to do' film.<br />Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) has everything going for her.  She is a peppy Southern California beauty, runner-up in a Miss Hawaiian Tropic Contest, sorority president, and carries a 4.0 GPA at UCLA in Fashion Designing.  Moreover, she is optimistic of becoming the wife of Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), a handsome and successful young man from a prominent family of lawyers, whose desire is to be a senator by age 30.<br />Expecting Warner to pop the question, Elle is devastated to hear that he wants to end the relationship.  His reason is even more shattering; &quot;He needs a Jackie, not a Marilyn.&quot;  In other words, Elle carries a social stigma and persona that the world will see, and it is not the style of the Huntington tradition.  She is 'illegally blond.'<br />Being an 'illegal blond' in Warner's eyes, Elle is determined to follow him to Harvard Law School and regain his affection.  With her tenacious spirit and resolve, she passes the entrance exam, and produces a creatively funny autobiographical video for the school officials, to which they acknowledge Harvard's need for 'diversity.'  Elle is in.  Now, she must prove to Warner, the world, but more importantly to herself, that she is LEGALLY BLONDE.<br />Reese Witherspoon played the role of the blonde California girl with a lot of moxie.  Her character was not the CLUELESS Cher Horowitz, played by Alicia Silverstone in 1995, but a smarter goal-driven blonde.  Sad to say, Silverstone, typecast with her dumb blonde character, never really rebounded from it.  The same type thing happened with Raquel Welch, who had a bit part in this film as Mrs. Windham-Vandermark.  It is ironic that Welch was in this flick for she was typecast as a buxom beauty in her own career. One can only hope Reese will not suffer the same, because all three ladies are terrific actresses.<br />The movie watcher cannot help falling in love with Elle for she is more than dropdead gorgeous, but smart, determined, and compassionate.  She struggles in her relationship with fellow law students and professors, but extends a hand to other outcasts in the film such as Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge), the divorced manicurist, and David the Dork (Oz Perkins).  Moreover, Elle personifies integrity as she withholds the alibi of her client from her law professor.<br />In conclusion, this is a surprisingly good movie, especially for first-time director, Robert Luketic; however, without the performance of Witherspoon the film would have been almost illegal.  The movie is terribly predictable, but fun and entertaining.  Rent it or buy it...it's LEGALLY okay.autobiographical video for the school officials, to which they acknowledge Harvard's need for 'diversity.'  Elle is in.

B000000XB9|4.0|Well seeing as my mother was very versed in the rock of the 60's and 70's, it's no wonder why I greatly enjoy CCR's greatest hits album.  It has every song that's worth listening to all on one great CD.  A must have for those who are into the classic rock and its roots.
B00003CXBK|5.0|For starters, I felt I should review this item due to the fact that it seems to have been primarily reviewed 11 and 12 year olds who obviously know even less about anime then they do about spelling and grammar!<BR>  Anyway, this is the best anime movie I've seen, and while I will admit the English translation is a bit ruff around the edges, it is far too minor a flaw to put a damper on my feelings about this masterpiece. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, only rivaled by the absolutely-spectacular-but-not-quite-as-great Ghost in the Shell. I should also note that this movie can be quite violent at times(such as decapitation and dismemberment of limbs), but I feel it is simply an active portrayal of battles in ancient Japan. They didn't suger-coat anything, and I like that! But if you don't enjoy seeing great globs of blood, just keep in mind that, no matter how good the animation is, it is still just 2D pictures with paint over them.<BR>  All in all, this is defiantly a must see for anyone over the age of 13 who enjoy really good anime. I highly recommend this movie, for it is truly a shame if the only people who are watching it are little kids who aren't even old enough to legally see it without their mommy's.
B00003CXDD|5.0|When Neil Armstrong set foot on the Moon in 1969, the whole world paused; now such things are second nature to everyone, veritably taken for granted as more and more science fiction becomes reality every day.  In 1977, when George Lucas made \\"Star Wars,\\" it turned the cinematic universe on it's ear with it's scope and vision, offering things neither seen nor experienced by anyone before; now his accomplishments are virtually taken for granted, his vision dismissed by many with a shrug.  But in this original story by Lucas, that vision is captured once again and proffered to the world via the magic of the movies, in \\"Willow,\\" directed by Ron Howard.<br /> A long time ago, in a galaxy perhaps far, far away, a baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife, Kaiya (Julie Peters).  The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  But the Queen, too, knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark.  For the sake of his village, as well as the safety of the child, it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda.  So Willow sets out upon his journey, and along the way finds an ally-- maybe-- in the person of the self-proclaimed \\"World's greatest swordsman,\\" Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), and together (sort of) they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.<br /> With some help from George Lucas, Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale-- which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch-- with a touch of magic of his own.  A showcase of special F/X-- it pioneered the \\"morphing\\" technique so vital to the success of films like \\"The Abyss\\" (filmed one year after this one) and \\"Terminator 2:  Judgment Day\\" (1991)-- it is nevertheless decidedly not a \\"special F/X\\" movie.  The F/X, though abig part of the film, to be sure, do not supersede the story.  And because of that, it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible, and takes the whole film to a higher level.  A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful, in fact, is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story (With Lucas, for example, his \\"American Graffiti\\" and even \\"THX-1138,\\" and Howard's \\"Parenthood,\\" \\"Night Shift\\" and \\"Apollo 13\\") and knowing how to convey it to their audience.  It's the difference between being a true filmmaker, and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it (Like Adam Shankman with \\"The Wedding Planner,\\" Jeff Franklin's \\"Love Stinks,\\" Nick Gomez with \\"Drowning Mona\\" or Peter Ho-sun Chan's \\"The Love Letter.\\"  All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility).<br /> In the title role, Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life, as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan.  Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen, but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh, whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.<br /> In a supporting role, however-- and with extremely limited screen time-- it is Julie Peters who really captures the attention with a sincere and affecting performance as Kaiya.  She has such a pure and natural manner that it's hard to believe this is an actor playing a part; the realism she achieves, in fact, can be compared to that of Harriet Andersson in any one of a number of Ingmar Bergman's films.  Her ability is a true gift that endows her with a quality and a presence that would make her an asset to any film, as she certainly is here.  And it's a shame she has apparently never been afforded the opportunity of plying hercraft more-- \\"Willow\\" is her only feature film.  It's a singular success, however, and one of which she can be proud.  Her portrayal of Kaiya goes far in demonstrating the positive effect a supporting role can have on a film, especially when it's this well acted.<br /> The supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes (Fin Raziel), Billy Barty (High Aldwin), Pat Roach (General Kael), Gavan O'Herlihy (Airk), David Steinberg (Meegosh), Mark Northover (Burglekutt), Kevin Pollak (Rool), Rick Overton (Franjean) and Maria Holvoe (Cherlindrea).  With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner, \\"Willow\\" is an entertaining, enlightening film, rich in characterization and metaphor, with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part; as well as the fact that one person can, indeed, make a difference.  Visually stunning, too, it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic, and a journey definitely worth taking.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy!  My husband and I liked it as well as our 3 and 6 year olds.  Even our teenage daughters, who don't want to watch too many of the little ones' movies, sat and watched the whole movie and loved it!<br />I don't know if the previous reviewer was expecting too much from this movie just because the critics loved it so much.  I never listen to critics because I rarely agree with them.  However, Shrek is a movie that they got right!<br />The characters in this movie are great.  They all have distinct personalities and the actors who did the voices were the best (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow are the main characters). We especially love Eddie Murphy as Donkey.  If you've never watched &quot;Mulan&quot;, you should.  Eddie Murphy is excellent as the little dragon, Mushu!<br />So lighten up everyone.  This is basically a kid's movie.  It's just an added plus that everyone in the family can enjoy it also!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Eddie Murphey as the voice of donkey, Mike Myers the voice of Shrek,Cameron Diaz the voice of princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the voice of Lord Farquaad.  Could the movie ever be more funny? I think that this is most hilarious, facinating movie on earth.  Donkey is anoying i admit, but he is very funny.  Shrek the great green fright machine might be a little mean to donkey sometimes, but he's also funny.  Princess Fiona, I would say isn't much of a joker, she's more quiet, I would say, but if ever she wants something badly she screams REAL LOUD. Lord Farquaad probably the person that you will hate the most in this movie, is dum.<br />The graphics on this movie are great, the movie is even 3D.  The sound comes out clear, the charaters are very well made, and well everything is perfect!!!!If you want a good laugh buy this movie.  It's worth it I swear.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus by TOOL is quite possibly the best rock album of all time. The music is so layered and deep, I can't even begin to describe it. Lateralus is much like Aenima, but is a step above it, musically. I've been listening to Aenima for years now, usually a cd spends a couple months at most in my CD player and then I don't pick it up for a while. But I've been listening to Aenima since 1997, and i think Lateralus is even better. As far as I can tell it's impossible to get tired of Tool's music. I can't pick a favorite Tool song because every single one is incredibly good. However when it comes to the albums, I would say they've been getting better and better. And if you don't have Lateralus get it NOW.

B00005R87Q|2.0|This movie is about the underground import street racing that has become popular in the late 90's and still is going strong today.  If the movie had some more plot or some more action it would be better.  The racing scenes are not that spectacular and the plot is non-exsistent.   This movie would not be bad as a rental, but to buy it, save your money.  Maybe if the director had added about ten more minutes into the plot then it would have been ok, but he didn't and nothing really makes sense.  It seems everything happens way too quickly and we never understand what is happening.
0393312836|5.0|The Kubrick movie won Best Picture, and it deserved it. But you should read this book because the language-Nadsat-is beautiful, once mastered. Of course, the story is important for us today because much of Burgess' predictions of the &quot;near future&quot; have come to pass.Open your newspaper and you will find Alex's droogs are alive and well in your neighborhood.As a political/morality tale, it is a classic.Kubrick really couldn't explain Alex as well as Alex can, even though there is some necessary narration in the movie, or else the Nadsat spoken would not be understood.<BR>So,buy it  and enjoy! Let &quot;Your Humble Narrator&quot;(Alex) explain all!
B000002IAZ|5.0|Yep, only a couple of albums and they broke up, and the ex Buffalo Springfielders went on to form some of the best and most famous groups in Rock history.<br />Well, them boys had talent and this retrospective showcases songs by all of them, and there ain't a dud in the lot.  Shows what a strange and unique momentary crossroads that group was, and just how good these guys were when they were wee babes!  If you're not going to buy all the original albums, this will do.
0140072187|5.0|this account of the vietnam war from a helicopter pilot's perspective is THE BEST book  i have read  about that war from anyone's perspective.the author  does an excellent job of describing the combat  action, but more importantly, he gets you right into the cockpit with him -first in flying school, then coming into  a &quot;hot&quot; LZ when the intensity of  feelings is almost unbearable.mason is that unusual combination of compelling writer with a compelling true story to tell.The sequel to this book-&quot;chickenhawk-back in the world&quot; is possibly even better! what happens when he gets back is maybe as much of a dangerous mission as any during the war. in the end the writer succeeds in the ultimat mission--letting you into his head.
B00005JKES|1.0|The DVD set is bogus without the pilot. My wife and I had never seen the the show and initially thought &quot;maybe the 'as seen in the previous episode' is one of those wierd but supposedly endearing David Lynch things.&quot; No, in fact, it's just incomplete crud due to licensing difficulties.<br />I plan to return my set after watching only the first episode. Maybe the series was half decent, but the DVD set is DEFECTIVE. Save your money--this is half-baked junk.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Oops is right. On Britney Spear's second album, \\"oops!...I did it again\\" she goes to new lows in emotionless fluff. First off, I would like to say that it's sad that even though the album is annoying to begin with, by far the most annoying three are \\"Oops!...I did it Again\\", \\"Lucky\\", and \\"Dear Diary\\"; the first two its singles, the latter the only one that actually has her writing credits (\\"Dear Diary\\" is so grotesque and moronic I burst out laughing). Second, no, I don't own the album; it's my sisters. Third, I don't see what the big deal about Britney is in general. She doesn't write the songs (which don't have good lyrics in the first place), she doesn't play an instrument (ditto for the background), can't sing, and I'd go so far to say she isn't that hot. She can sort of dance (SORT OF), and that's really about it. If anyone could tell me where her huge, sucessful talent lies, I would sure like them to tell me. Thirdly, at three of four points on the album it has strange conversations between Britney and her friends. Are they supposed to be funny? Hardly. Cute? God no. Serious glimplses of her soul? Doesn't say much for her soul if they are. They're really mostly embarassing. Lastly, it has a cover of the Rolling Stone's classic \\"(Can't get no) Satisfaction\\". And, true to her word, we sure can't get no satisfaction from the song. What was Jaggar thinking handing over the rights? On future albums, Britney will make \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" patriotic, \\"Loosing my Religion\\" religious, and \\"Bad\\", well, um...bad.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|The pedigree of this 4 disc set is well documented in other reviews.  Lester Bangs loved this stuff and advised Lenny Kaye how to compile a two record set way back when.  In their coolest move to date, Rhino graciously re-release and expands the concept to provide a giant chunk of rock and roll heaven to those who need and desire it.  Lenny Kaye originally considered it early \\"Psychedlia\\" and the new box set gets off on its proto-punk description.  But, in reality, it is nothing more than a well thought out history of the 'kick out the jams' American rock and roll released between 1965 and 1967.  Starting off with Louie, Louie (the grandaddy of them all) and ending up with Detroit's very own Ted Nugent, it is one [heck] of a ride.  Some of it [stinks].  But over half of it is gold.<BR>  <BR>         So... Here is what you do:  Aquire it and burn it down to your favorite two discs (even Tom Cruise would find that legal!).  Is that worth $...?  I guess it depends on your love for rock and roll.<br />My only two complaints are 1)  it does not contain 96 Tears by ? & The Mysterians (whatever record company scum bag keeping this from us shall burn);  2)  it's not in chronological order (which makes it more listenable in my opinion).

B000002GW5|5.0|I know The Pretender gets more attention, but this is my favorite Jackson Browne album.  This one isn't as slick as The Pretender, but I think it's got more soul.  People who like contemporary country music would probably like this record a lot, too, it's the kind of california rock that seems to be influencing a lot of what's going on in country now.<br />I agree with other reviewers who say that it evokes and creates a certain period of time.<br />Right now, as I write this, I'm listening to &quot;Rosie&quot; for the first time in more than a decade -- I'm very glad I bought the cd.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I could not believe this was a No Doubt album when I first heard it.  How can a band that has consistently been so good be so BAD!   If you like repetition this album is for you.  I have three children so the concept of a phrase being repeated over and over is not a new one to me.  I have always enjoyed Gwen's writing ability, that was one of the things that first interested me in the band was the clever lyrics, new and creative ways of saying old things.  I was excited to see what they would come up with this time.  It took me all of 3 minutes to realize what they had come up with, now it's going to take me 3 weeks to get the ringing out of my ears.  I read somewhere that Gwen likes to use a thesaurus when she is writing, but on this album she didn't-believe me it shows!  Bottom line-Gwen should go back to using a thesaurus because this recording is bad,amiss,...,dissatisfactory,poor and rotten!
0767802659|4.0|First of all, this is a Paul Verhoeven movie, and all of his movies are stunningly beautiful pieces of cinematography.  The characters, particularly the women, are incredibly good looking.  I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office.  The buzz that I heard was that the studio didn't market it well.  Unlike &quot;Independance Day&quot;, which successfully blended sci-fi, patriotism, and comedy, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is great sci-fi but takes a darker, more cynical view of patriotism, and the comedy is more subtle and tongue in cheek, as if you are supposed to roll your eyes and shake your head.  Some scenes are intended to gross you out and the violence is extremely graphic.  That said, the spaceship scenes are as good as &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the special effects are as good as &quot;The Mummy&quot;.  Against the wishes of his rich parents, high school hotshot Casper Van Dien joins the starship troopers to please his gorgeous girlfriend Denise Richards who is going to the Fleet Academy to become a starship pilot.  Another classmate is a vivacious blonde who also joins the starship troopers because she is carrying a torch for our hero and wants to be near him.  Their lives are totally changed when we go to war against a race of alien bugs from another star system.  That's the story.  As a note of interest in the post 9-11 era, at the end of the movie we end up with the starship troopers pulling the top bug out of a cave on a planet that looks like Afghanistan.  As a wise and funny man once said, &quot;It's deja vu all over again!&quot;
6305428220|5.0|The Faculty - possibly one of the best films ever created. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  It was both thrilling and in some parts funny.  The cast was great, especially Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett.  Josh Hartnetts role was great.  It would have been great to have some good special features on the DVD, but I would buy it simply because it is a great movie.
B000008LOU|3.0|This is a step down from the Wilburys first album that came out two years earlier, but there is still much to like here.  The album kicks off with the strongest rocker of the Wilbury's two-album history, &quot;She's My Baby&quot; with the sizzling guitar solo provided by one-time Thin Lizzy guitarist Gary Moore. The album (in the absence of fallen comrade Roy Orbison) is dominated by Dylan and Petty.  The albums strongest track is Dylan's &quot;If You Belonged to Me&quot; with its plaintive harmonica reminding listeners of his classic Sixties work.  Dylan and Petty share vocal chores on the uptempo &quot;The Devil's Been Busy&quot; while Harrison adds some nice sitar accents.  Harrison's lone lead vocal is on &quot;Where Were You Last Night?&quot; where he trades verses with Dylan on this acoustic number.  Elsewhere, Dylan does a doo-wop send-up on &quot;7 Deadly Sins.&quot; &quot;New Blue Moon&quot; has a slightly Carribean feel to it as well as Harrison's signature slide guitar work. The album closes with the infectious &quot;Willbury Twist.&quot; The booklet inlcudes lyrics, &quot;how to&quot; instructions and even  illustrations to this song. [Sample lyric:  &quot;Put your hand on your head, put your feet in the air / Then hop around the room in your underwear.&quot;]  It's best if you approach this album with limited expectations; this allows you the opportunity to appreciate the joys that await you here. RECOMMENDED
B000021YQV|5.0|Over the past few years, it seems that real rock has been fading from sight and music like bubble gum pop and weak rock acts have been controlling the airwaves. 2001 was a time when great hard rock like sevendust, nickelback and staind began getting a great deal of attention. System of a down is one of those groups. They mix an interesting combination of politics suchas as prison with humor like bounce with some stuff that is a little more personal like forest. The band plays fast and hard putting a great deal of intensity into what they do which can be seen the great quality of songs they have written for toxicity
B000008LOV|5.0|This low-key supergroup effort by Harrison, Dylan, Orbison, Petty and Lynne was a well deserved hit when it was released in 1988, peaking at No. 3 on Billboard's album charts.  And justifiably so. The album is filled with wonderfully crafted (if sometimes slight) and enjoyable songs. In hindisght, that appeared to be the goal of this project--to have a good time. There are no superstar trappings here.  All songwriting credits are attributed to the Traveling Wilburys. In fact, real names are not to be found anywhere on the album.<br />There are numerous highlights, beginning with the the album's first single &quot;Handle With Care,&quot; which features vocals by Harrison and Orbison with some nice slide guitar work from Harrison as well.  Dylan's tongue-in-cheek lyrics to &quot;Dirty Work&quot; give new meaning to 'auto'-eroticism. [Sample lyric: You don't need no wax job / You're smooth enough for me / If you need your oil changed / I'll do it for you free.] &quot;Rattled&quot; is a delightful rockabilly number.  &quot;Last Night&quot; has a funky Jamaican rhythm to it. &quot;Not Alone Any More&quot; features Orbison's soaring tenor reminiscent of his Monument-era classics. &quot;Heading for the Light&quot; with Harrison handling lead vocal also makes good use of saxophone.  &quot;End of the Line&quot; closes the album with a terrific uptempo rocker and sadly serves as a fitting tribute to Orbison who died of a heart attack not long after the album was completed.  [The survivng Wilburys did a wonderful video to this track paying tribute to their musical comrade.]<br />Additional support is provided by honorary Wilburys Jim Keltner (drums), Jim Horn (saxophones), and Ray Cooper (percussion).  From start to finish, this album is a pure joy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JKQX|4.0|This film takes up the story of Dr. John Forbes Nash Jr. from his days of graduate school at Princeton up to the year 1994 when he received the Nobel prize for economics.  I enjoyed this film immensely, despite its flaws.<br />The first part of the film shows Nash during his graduate days, and it is the lightest part of the film.  We see Nash use mathematical talk in daily life with humorous results, such as when he tries to pick up a girl at a bar by suggesting that they \\"exchange bodily fluids.\\"  He is so tactless that it is actually a bit funny, such as when he tells someone at a coctail party in a flat voice, \\"I've read your papers, and  I'm convinced there isn't an original idea in any of them.\\"  This section of the movie closes with an explanation of the idea that eventually earned Nash the Nobel.<br />The film moves on to his professorship at MIT and his courtship with one of his students (Alicia Larde) whom he later marries.  All of this is the calm before the storm.<br />Next we see his world crumble around him as he becomes convinced that he is a secret agent working to uncover a dreadful communist plot.  He is diagnosed with paranoid schitzophrenia and committed to a mental hospital, and we follow his release and continuing struggle with the illness up to his eventual recovery.<br />The film succeeds as a look at the life of John Nash.  John's delusions are portrayed as though they are real events which is effective because we can understand John's motivations for all of his actions.  His moody and sometimes violent behavior are perfectly rational given his understanding of the world.  If the treatment somehow glorifies schitzophrenia, that is also somehow appropriate sinse Nash stated that one of his hurtles to recovery was the relative lack of excitement in \\"ordinary\\" reality.<br />On a deeper level the film works as a piece of wisdom that is more universally applicable, as a study of integrating the mind and emotions to become a more balanced human being, and on learning how to turn off that damnable inner critic that most of us possess (though not to a delusional degree for most people.)  It is for the universal nature of the film that I give it high marks.<br />The film has flaws which prevent a 5 star review.  The biggest glaring problem is that Alicia is portrayed as the faithful wife who truly lives her vow to love her husband \\"in sickness and in health.\\"  In reality, Alicia eventually divorced her husband when it became clear that he was not going to recover.  The couple eventually got back together several years after Nash recovered, though they never remarried.<br />Also, Nash was a mathematical genius during his entire lifetime, and the film falsely portrays otherwise, hinting that he came up with one great result that bagged him the Nobel and then slipped into madness never to publish again.  There's a scene where he states that he \\"is working on the Riemann hypothesis\\" but we never see anything completed.  In reality, Nash solved a complex problem in topology which was probably his most brilliant idea, and did other work in partial differential equations.  The film could have taken some time to explore the topological result, explaining the essense in non-mathematical language, similiar to its treatment of his game theoretic result.<br />Finally the score is rather lackluster.  A baroque music score would have better served this film, since music of that era captures the essense of abstract mathematics the best.  (In fact Nash had a habbit of whistling Bach, so it's not too much to ask to have Bach in the background.)
0800129806|2.0|This spin on the Camelot myth is a rather alienating one. It yielded some good things, such as Julia Ormond's Guenevere as a true woman of the people. Sean Connery had a staid, dignified charisma about him as King Arthur. But when he speaks, he is practically chomping on the words.<BR> While I don't necessarily mind an older actor like Richard Gere playing Launcelot, I would like to know how the character went from being a French nobleman to an orphaned English lad who lives by his wits. As a knight, he justifies the tragedies of his early life by helping to save others from similar fates. I suppose the writers of this script would justifiy changing Launcelot's character that way.<BR> Camelot itself now has an interestingly distinguished and antiseptic look about it. Whereas in the Lerner and Lowe musical, it had a nice pink glow about it, the dream kingdom now has Royal blue as its symbolic color.<BR> I hadn't seen Ben Cross do anything for years before I saw him in this movie. I don't remember a Malagant anywhere in the King Arthur ledgend. I guess this is what can happen when a well-known story becomes public domain. Anybody can do anything.<BR> Seeing Malagant come to a just end was a redeeming quality, although I didn't care much for the forced intensity of the final battle scene, brought on by that annoying chorus going \\"Dominus, Dominus\\" in the background. At the end,those involved in the love triangle reconcile. But the funeral scene is a ripoff of the 1958 movie, \\"The Vikings\\".<BR> This is a film I may watch every now and then, but I prefer the 1967 musical over this one. Nice try folks! Better luck next time.
B00005RHGK|4.0|OKAY SO THIS MOVIE AINT THAT BAD! THE PLOT IS REALLY ORIGINAL IT STARTED VERY WELL BUT CONTINUED TO BE TIPICALLY TRASHY FOR A HORROR FLICK! I MEAN THIOSE TWO KIDS: CAN THERE BE SOMEONE AS STUPID AS THEM!? HELLO?! HOWEVER THE MOVIE WOULDN'T BE THAT BAD IF &quot;JEEPERS CREEPERS&quot; WOULD'NT TURN INTO A HUGE BAT THINGY! THE END IS KINDA WEIRD BUT ALSO NICE SO AT LEAST YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT!
B000002C4J|4.0|this album has been a massive hit everywhere in the world and represent for Celine the peak (up to now) and the highlight of her career.A great exemple of that is the fact that she broke a record in Europe with 9 000 000 copies sold.It's certainly one of the biggest hit of the 90's as well as MY HEART WILL GO ON, a too much heard song, i think.But there is some great songs like TELL HIM,IMMORTALITY, LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE, US AND OTHER.In fact, these songs are great but not attractive so that i could listen to them really often, for me. But anyway, one song is incredible : it's TO LOVE YOU MORE(u.s. only).What a wonderful song!!!Finally, you'll ENJOY this album but not as falling into you or others. ANOTHER FACT: 30 000 000 fans cannot be wrong...
B000000OQY|5.0|I firmly believe that everyone on this planet should be issued this album at birth as a guide to the ways of the world. I mean, just listen to the song One in a Million. The poignancy of Axl's lyrics just drive home those real-life social issues that affect us all. Wait, hold on, on second thought One in a Million is about the dumbest song ever penned. How come everyone gets upset about Jimmy the Greek and no one calls Axl on his dumb racism? I mean, Jimmy got banned from CBS, but did Axl get banned from the music industry? Oh, wait does it count if you get fat and bald and are too embarassed to come back to the public eye? Sorry Axl, we don't care. Please come back!
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie was exact to the true story and had a killer cast.  Depp and Cruz were amazing and very convincing!  This movie had me really pulling for Jung and heartbroken about his fate.  The extra features on this DVD were wonderful and made this story even more entertaining.  I loved it!
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard \\"One Step Closer\\" on the radio back in 2000, before anyone knew of Linkin Park and the album was nothing but a [$$$]feature in stores, I fell in love with the song, and didn't buy into the band until August 2001, after \\"In The End\\" began rotating. I got the record and learned to love the album after my first listen. It does go by-the-numbers most of the way, and it's awfully short (clocking in at just under 40 minutes), but Linkin Park seemed to have something better going for it, with more unique qualities then the other formulatic rock-rap molds in the music world. Mr. Hahn's beats and noises are quirky and strange, but new and brilliant as well. The metal guitars are new and sound like they are sampled out of some Limp Bizkit musical CD, and Mike Shinoda's flows are like grunge lyrics rapped. Lead man Chester has a ear-piercing vocal growl and a lovely voice when need be. The band uses all this to make one catchy song after another. The hard metal throttle of \\"One Step Closer\\" to the piano-laden \\"In The End\\" to the modern rockish \\"Pushing Me Away\\" all make for great moments. The hard rocking \\"Points Of Authority\\" (with an awesome finish) and the beat-driven \\"Papercut\\" make for the album's best cuts. \\"Forgotten,\\" is the albums's more punkish tune as the melodic \\"A Place For My Head\\" has a great beat and classic echoed riff. The albums weakness is \\"Cure For the Itch\\" which is pretty dull and \\"By Myself,\\" which is too blurred and loud. They may be one of the victims of the rock-rap fusion, but these guys stand out from the pack, which a more unique touch to their sound. Linkin Park may sound devilishly good, but this ain't no love story; this is strictly anger's territory. Anger sells, and Linkin Park has the record sales to prove it.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I know so many people panned this movie when it came out, yet I still had an interest in it and wanted to see it. I'm glad I did because it was great fun. Nothing to be taken too seriously; it is what it is: a movie based on a video game. But it is beautifully shot with exotic locations and fantastic action sequences. Angelina Jolie is, of course, beautiful and easy to watch. It's a fun movie, and I'm glad to add it to my library.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork's \\"Post\\" is definitely one of her strongest records.  Wait, what am I saying?  Bjork is one of the artists whose all records are of equal (or nearly equal value or impact).  I personally find myself gravitating towards more to the liking of her earlier recordings.  Her \\"Debut\\" was the perfect showcase of dance/pop tunes hinting at her risk-taking (some people would say weird) twists and interesting hooks, yet for the most part it remained a conventional refreshing pleaser.  Nonetheless, I recognize \\"Homogenic\\" as her best recording.<br />In \\"Post,\\" Bjork succumbs to her more artistic chance taking nature that has permeated her later records, many times sacrificing essential pop melodies (by no means a deplorable move -- as seen on the brilliant \\"Homogenic\\").  This album captures the best of the two sounds, featuring gorgeous melodies (\\"Isobel,\\" \\"You've Been Flirting Again,\\" and the at times bouncy \\"It's Oh So Quiet), as well as irresistible bass (\\"Enjoy\\") or pulsating exotic dance (\\"I Miss You\\"), to atypical yet truly condusive melody (her absolute sealed \\"Hyperballad\\" and \\"The Modern Things\\").  Bjork is a winner.   The album opens most refreshingly with \\"Army of Me,\\" which substantial lyrics and semi-rocker aspiration sound fares victoriously and continues as such with very few listens.  Despite the afore mentioned risks, the album is embraced by the ears relatively quickly (which is where the old Bjork differs from the new one), much like her first album.  The title of this album is also a clever pattern.  Where \\"Debut\\" was an original, if not terribly obvious title for her first CD, this followup is a \\"Post\\" debut, which works similarly.  <br />Through all of Bjork's risk-taking antics, it's truly no risk for the buyer to invest in this product....

B00005OM4N|3.0|britneys 3rd cd has some well done tracks. like &quot;slave 4 u&quot; and &quot;not a girl,not yet awoman&quot;. her voice hasant really changed, however some of the songs bring out the best in it, for what it is. &quot;slave 4 u&quot; is a exceptionally good song, with its more jungle feel. &quot;oops i did it again&quot; album is my personal favorite, it contains britneys typical style and sound, but maybe if she tried writng some more of her own songs this cd would be better? i dont know, but this cd is a little confusing. Its good though, we have here something a little different from Britney, and its really not that bad. I would not buy the cd, but get the singles, they are more worth it.
B000001F7Y|5.0|And boy, does it ROCK! RUSH was released in October 1974 (not in 1976 as someone else wrote) and it shows them at their raw beginnings. If you know Rush only from their MOVING PICTURES period, or especially later on, and haven't heard their first album yet then you will be pretty shocked by what you hear. I know that I was when my best friend back in high school bought it and played it for me! <br />This sounds *nothing* like the sleek, progressive Rush of the lush, epic songs that most people know first. This album had only two major influences: Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, period.  Geddy Lee's singing, I mean screaming, was clearly Plant-influenced, and their music is basically a combo of Zep's guitar groove (guitarist Alex Lifeson's riff on &quot;What You're Doing&quot; is very similar to Jimmy Page's on &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;) and Sabbath's deep, dark guitar drone. Despite how different this was from their later music, Rush actually mastered this raw sound quite successfully.<br />At this point, Rush had John Rutsey on drums; Neil Peart would replace him soon after. Since Neil Peart has been pretty much the sole lyricist for the band ever since (especially from 2112 on), there is no intelligent poetry here.  Instead, many of the songs concern Geddy Lee's horniness and the fact that he is &quot;In The Mood&quot; and &quot;Needs Some Love&quot;, and the most intelligent songs has him &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, being a &quot;Working Man&quot;, and him being &quot;Here Again&quot;. But hey, these are the types of subjects with which heavy, bluesy hard rock is supposed to deal. What else did you expect? :)<br />Some of the greatest heavy metal riffs come from this album, especially on &quot;What You're Doing&quot;, &quot;Working Man&quot;, and &quot;Finding My Way&quot; which they continued to perform in concert for years afterward even when they became a prog-metal band.  I personally love every single song on this album, except for &quot;Take A Friend&quot; which is the *only* goofy song on this entire CD.<br />If you're a fan of Rush's progressive years, but not of the sound of Zep or the Sabs, then you probably will hate this CD (at least at first listen).  If you're like me and love all of the above types, then you will probably love this CD.  This is one of the greatest hard rock/heavy metal debut CDs of all time, and is definite air-guitar material! Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B000000W6R|5.0|I got this album after &quot;Adore&quot;, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and &quot;Gish&quot; and I can't stop listening to it! Songs like &quot;Starla&quot; , &quot;Blew Away&quot; or the astonishing &quot;Landslide&quot; should be A-sides! A very personal, dark and introspective album. We start with &quot;Soothe&quot; a sweet, simple and beautiful song, after that we have another smash &quot;Blew Away&quot; the only song where Billy didn't stuck his nose into, but simply superb (after you get used to the vocals, you'll love it! Ok, now to the best song of them all... LANDSLIDE ! A beautiful ballad that makes me cry, with a nice guitar and the soft beautiful voice of Billy , although Billy didn't write the lyrics the song it's still AWESOME! There are other great song like &quot;Starla&quot; , &quot;Hello Kitty Kat&quot; or the hilarious &quot;Spaced&quot; . Fantastic Work guys!
6303430570|3.0|After seeing the excellent movie &quot;Dogma&quot;, also by Kevin Smith, I was expecting a great movie that was interesting, intellectually stimulating , cynical, and hilarious throughout.  In the end, though, I found this movie very boring for the most part.<br />At many points it just seemed like senseless rambling to me, espessially in vulgarity.  I wasn't offended, as I don't thing vulgarity is always bad, but I just felt like it brought the movie down somewhat.  <br />I would suggest seeing &quot;Dogma,&quot; which I think is a masterpeice in many respects, and really shows Kevin Smith's talent thourogly..<br />Again, in the end, this movie has great scenes that really make you think and show Kevin Smith's intelligence, but many of them just make you laugh by the simple fact that you are supposed to...
B00003CXXP|4.0|I've read the review and what I wanted to write about this movie he already did. I have just small additions. As a movie score fan, I want to talk about John Williams's score. <BR> I bought the score before seeing the movie so I knew the music for every scene. When I first went to the theater, it was quite amazing journey for me with knowing the music, but without knowing the scenes. The theme written for Monica is outstanding even for Williams. But that was not enough for Williams, in the dark future with ice covering all the world, he wrote such a music which actually make me freeze like the ice and the smooth tranisition from that cold music to Monica's theme at the final is perfect. If you liked this movie and can see cinema as a dance of motion and sound, listen to the music somehow and watch the movie afterwards again.<BR> I want to talk about the script also. The only &quot;weak&quot; part of the script was when David threw himself in the ocean and by &quot;luck&quot; saw the blue fairy deep down. It was too fast, maybe some additional scenes would smoothen the transition of the storyline.  And it was needed since the story changed it's mood to a &quot;tale&quot; in that scene. I'm not complaining about it because  it started like that in the beginning of the movie with a narration but the narrator didn't show up until that scene again, I would say that second act was too short, maybe a 3 hour movie would be better. <BR>Anyway, except that part, there's nothing which was not enough for me, I always loved Spielberg's storytelling and everything about the movie was almost perfect. And like Robert Sercombe wrote, there's more than meets the eye in the movie. Did you check the website of the movie and talked with the A.I. in the website? You should since it's one of the most successful bots written so far and for the ones which can't understand what the movie says about &quot;Artificial Intelligence - Human difference&quot; or better explained as &quot;ArtificialIntelligence - Human resemblance&quot;, talk to the &quot;bot&quot; and notice that it isn't so much different than talking to a person, and it's only the year 2002 yet. The movie was I think trying to show the part we can't understand about the concept of &quot;feelings&quot;. But afterall, aren't emotions also some kind of a program code written in the language of logic? They are just more complex than first order logic so we simply reject that a robot can &quot;feel&quot;.  The scene where David talks to the blue fairy is one of its kind I think since he was programmed to chase his feelings to love and he does it for 2000 years which certainly humans would do if they could live so long.<BR> I really can't write everything I think about the movie here since it would be too long and too hard to put together in such a complex story which looks so simple.<BR> So as Robert Sercombe I suggest you to watch the movie again and again and try to understand what you didn't so far without prejudices. <BR> I personally will buy the DVD and watch it 15 times at least since these kind of movie can't be understood in the first few times. <BR> Also a personal notice: Spielberg is the best :)

6304143184|5.0|This is defintely one of the best films ever made! ( Well maybe it is in my case because Thomas Howell is in it) lol*, but other than that its great! Its about a little boy named Elliot, one night he goes outside into the woods, and discovers a little lost alien, he is scared at first ( I mean who wouldnt be?) but then they start to develop  a friendship, and little did Elliot know that E.T could talk and communicate with Elliot! This movie stars C.Thomas Howell (Tyler) Sean Frye (Steve) K.C Martel (Greg) Dee Wallace (Mary Elliot's Mother)Henry Thomas(Elliot) Drew Barrymore (Gertie) Robert McNaughton (Micheal) and Peter Coyote as the scientist. I was kind of dissapointed because they didnt show too much of C.Thomas Howell, and that made me upset because I love him so much, and hes my favorite actor, but that parts that he was in were my favorite parts, like the bike scenes, and the bustop scene. I really do wish he was more, because thats the only reason why i bought this movie!
B00005RYKU|2.0|If you are looking for a good thriller... this movie is NOT for you. the movie had a poor story line and is hard to follow. there are numerous occasions where LeeLee does something (eg--&gt; saving the number of the man after mr. glass to the phone) and nothing comes of it.. almost like it's just a time filler because they cant think of anything better to put in there. once i watched the trailer again on the dvd i realized how much the trailer gave away the movie. it was almost as if you could watch the trailer other than watching the movie for 2 hours and still get the entire story line of the movie with the little added bits in there. but as a dvd in general, the special features were ok.. not as good as they could have been.. but oh well.
B00003CYLT|4.0|For the fan of Cirque, consider this the video equivalent of a souvenir program: beautiful but too short and too expensive.    Let's face it, Cirque is best experienced live. Second best is &quot;The Journey of Man&quot; in IMAX 3-D. We thoroughly enjoyed it and it really took advantage of the 3-D format to not only showcase acts but also tell a story, all through the typically remarkable vision and design of Cirque's creators. The only thing that video offers over live is good multiple camera setups and editing to give you many points of view. On the multi-story IMAX screen Journey's visual effect is dazzling and the sound thunderous. Friends gave us the DVD for Christmas and my first question was, &quot;does it come with the glasses?&quot; Sadly, no. So at best, the Journey DVD is only a reminder of the 3-D IMAX experience, as any Cirque video can only be a reminder of the actual performance. But after all, I still leaf through my souvenir programs years later and I still watch the videos. How could I not? Cirque in any form is amazing.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Personally I found 'Psycho' and 'Good Will Hunting' disappointing for various reasons so I didn't have high expectations but this is easily better than either movie and shows the promise that 'Psycho' hinted at (but was hindered by the strictures of a shot-by-shot remake that could never live up to the original, despite all the beauty of the film).<BR>AND, it was wonderful to hear Miles Davis!!!!!!  Buy the soundtrack even if you only rent the movie.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Initially, I put the headphones on at the listening station of the Megastore to hear &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, which is a guilty pleasure of mine, but I had no intention of buying this CD. <br />I was surprised that the rest of this CD is nothing like what I had heard of Pink before. I sort of expected the whole CD to be riddled with over-sampled, over-produced R&amp;B/Hip-Hop tracks which I wasn't terribly keen on. So impressive was her voice on the other tracks I heard, that I bought this. <br />I have only really listened a couple of times, but so far, I like it. It has alot more to offer than what you would think and it really showcases her vocal skills. <br />I suppose that if you want more of a Hip-Hop feel, you may be dissapointed. If not, buy this, her style is new and refreshing..makes you think that the horrible vapid pop machine that spawned Britney and 'Nsync is gasping it's last breath and only talented artists will survive.
6302642256|5.0|This movie was a family favorite when our children, now 23, 20, and 17, were younger.   It's light hearted, amusing, and sweet.<BR>A young boy (around 10 years old) is abducted by an Alien space craft which he learns to pilot.   Piloting this ship the boy interacts with a very vocal computer.   He flies through the skies of the USA listening to the Beach Boys and other happy music.   In the end the boy elects to turn back time to get back to his family who will remember non of the trauma of his disappearance.   A happy, heartwarming family movie.
B000002OX7|5.0|I used to not consider myself much of a fan of The Who. I had listened to my parent's vinyl copy of &quot;Tommy&quot; and also heard &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, yet they did not stand out to me as something I could truly enjoy. No hard feelings to those who like those albums, but for me, all the conceptual meyhem just stood in the way of The Who just writing some really great rockers. I was therefore reluctant to buy &quot;Who's Next&quot; but now realize that this was the album of their's I was looking for. We all know the classics but this album is suprisingly strong from start to finish, making it one of the best buys in classic rock.
B00004YKUY|1.0|This is without a doubt Journey's worst CD. There's only one decent song on it (Livin' To Do) and a ton of songs that are trying to imitate past work, all of which pale in comparison. The fact that 8 outside writers were brought in to help Cain, Schon and Augieri write these songs also speaks volumes, considering that all previous Journey albums featured little if any outside writing help. <br />First off, it was a HUGE mistake to hire a Perry clone in Augieri. This just shows that Schon and Cain are interested in living in the past instead of making actual &quot;new&quot; music for the future. They're trying to milk the name &quot;Journey&quot; for all it's worth (the fact Augieri also looks like Perry and has his mannerisms down also show that Messrs. Cain and Schon are hoping that some of the intoxicated folks at the concerts won't even notice that Perry is gone).<br />If Journey had any class, they would have did as the British group Marillion did when their lead singer left - they hired a new singer that sounded and looked absolutely nothing like him. And while they weren't as commercially successful, they have produced some spectacular music in their new direction.<br />As for Journey, they have truly sold their soul. But, as long as they're bringing in the $, I'm sure they really don't care.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Now, this CD was the best britney album EVER!!!  All of the songs are great especially Bombastic Love, overprotected, what its like to be me, I am not a girl, not yet a women.  They are all great.  I would definatly recommend getting this cd.
B000002J09|5.0|This album was the second best album in Heavy Metal for '71.<BR>It is a shame that Zeppelin could not step up a bit and make<BR>this the best album of the year.

6304936362|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I was distracted by the technical errors.  The P-51 instead of P-47 escorts, the lack of protective clothing, continual dropping of oxygen masks, and drinking of soup (?!?) at altitude.  But I have seen it a few more times and have come to really like it.  The scene with the letters about dead airmen playing over WWII bomber footage is very moving.  And it's just great to see footage of old warbirds like the B-17, P-51 and Me-109 (even though it's the Hispano built Merlin powered version) in the air together.  While this film does take many liberties with technical and historical facts, it is still great entertainment.  It is well acted and exciting.  And most importanly, it spurs your interest in the air war over Europe.  If this film, by being a combination of some fact and entertainment, nudged even one otherwise uninterested soul into learning more about the history of the air war, than it was a success, and a fitting tribute to the heroes who flew in that war.  This movie plays it's small part in seeing that they are NEVER forgotten.
0790729725|4.0|Great movie, not really needed on as DVD format, but if you have some money to burn and don't like VHS get it. Will always be a mob classic. Some of Liotta's best work and any movie with De Niro and Pesci has to be good. If you don't like violence then look somewhere else.
076790382X|3.0|When Bryson returned to the United States, settling in New Hampshire, after 20 years in Britian, he was asked to write a weekly essay for a British magazine.  The results are a compilation of these efforts and, as one might suspect, some of the essays are better than others. One will not find the raunchy humor of Bryson's &quot;Neither Here nor There&quot; nor the interesting detail of his Australian travel recounted &quot;In a Sunburned Country.&quot; <br />But Bryson, as always, manages to find humor, frequently directed at himself, in the trials and trivia of everyday American life, particularly those aspects that had changed since last he was a permanent resident.  And since these were written for a British audience, there is some playing to British biases about American and Americans in general.  <br />Bryson's wit is what carries the book, and in most of the essays there are Brysonian gems and riffs to cause a smile, a snicker, sometimes an outright belly laugh.  Sometimes he gets into too much silly exaggeration, at least for me, but overall there are sufficient truly funny pieces to cause one to part with a few shillings to buy the book.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Great action. Worth getting simply because of the cars and driving expierence. Plot is decent, acting and script need work but who cares. That's not why you are buying this movie. A movie meant for entertainment and that is exactly what it does.
0385505833|2.0|My husband and I &quot;skipped Christmas&quot; once by going to Australia and would like to do it again but not to the extreme that Grisham did.  You can buy the calendars &amp; friut cakes and put your frosty on the roof and still skip all the other hassles.  The biggest problem I had with his book was his research mistakes.  Just like his last book, he either decided to do no research or didn't care about being accurate.  There is no ship called &quot;Island&quot; Princess but I'll let that one go.  But Princess (and many other lines) does not have any 10 day voyage that stops in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, those are all 7 day trips.  And the biggest blunder - cruise insurance does NOT pay if you change your mind!  Many people found this out after 9/11. You have to have a valid (insured) reason to cancel your trip. So his multiple remarks about not having bought insurance wouldn't have made a bit of difference.
B00005NVT1|2.0|Sorry folks - I loved &quot;Homework&quot; (I would give that album 5 stars), and that's what makes this release all the more disappointing.  Instead of the fat, chunky beats that define Homework (Da Funk, Around the World, Revolution 909, etc.) this album, a 45-minute long live set, allows only glimpses of such songs amid a standard set of rather-boring techno.<br />I expected to hear all my fav's meshed together into one amazing live set, but all they do is pay slight tribute to their hits, (2-3 minutes of the familiar beats and then they're gone), leaving you with 35 minutes of boring dance music.<br />The best thing about &quot;Homework&quot; is that it is good for everything from shaking your ass to driving around town to chilling in your room.  &quot;Alive 1997&quot; might be good if you're throwing a techno-dance party, but it wears a bit thin for anything else.<br />My recommendation:  If you're just getting into Daft Punk, buy &quot;Homework&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot; before this album.  For those of you really into club music, (i.e. 30 minutes of the same thing) you'll probably like this too.  For big Daft Punk fans, you're gonna buy &quot;Alive&quot; anyhow, so why are you even reading this!?  :)<br />In summation, I guess I was a bit naive buying &quot;Alive 1997&quot; considering that it was marketed as a live set, but I assumed that maybe Daft Punk played different than most of your standard techno DJs.  I was wrong.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This DVD is great. I've had the S&amp;M double-cd for a while and always really liked it. I finally got the DVD for Christmas and I think Michael Kaymen is a total genius for coming up with this idea and making it all happen, kudos to Metallica. Incredible job, a truly unique sound. <br />Ego, vanity, and greediness aside I think Metallica and the Sanfrancisco Symphony did an incredible job and I would of given anything to see the peformance live. <br />The DVD presentation is well done. Excellent DD5.1 track, although a DTS track would of been preferred the DD track is still a treat.<br />This is an excellent concert and I recommend it to Metallica and Symphony fan's alike, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is hands down the most intense movie I have ever seen.  By the time it was through, I was in a cold sweat and unsure of whether to cry or be sick or both.  In an age where people are emotionally detached from just about everything, this movie forces a reaction.  This is not the type of movie I would see again, but it makes the viewer confront drug use like no other movie does.  If you thought &quot;Traffic&quot; was compelling, you haven't seen anything yet.
6304383827|5.0|I was surprisingly impressed by this adaptation of Emma. Gwyneth Paltrow, despite her accent, played an amazing Emma and made her extremely likable and endearing. Jeremy Northam was the perfect foil to her as the handsome Mr. Knightley. I agree with another reviewer in that he made this role his own as Colin Firth did in Pride and Prejudice playing Mr. Darcy. Paltrow and Northam have wonderful chemistry, which makes the characters that much more lovable. Although P&amp;P was a better read than Emma, I have to admit that I actually liked the latter more than the former when viewing it on the screen. The comedy in this film is great and kept me smiling throughout the whole two hours. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again and intend to purchase and add it to my Jane Austen collection :)

B00003CX6P|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley features brilliant performances through and through (Jude Law, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Gwyneth Paltrow) but the true revelation is Matt Damon.  It might seem like a big stretch for a hard-edged Bostonite ladies man type to play a 1950's homosexual hanger-on, but the stretch is right on.  It's a downright travesty Damon wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this performance.  He hits all the right notes: creepiness, subtle flamboyance, deviousness.  The character is so well imagined (from the Patricia Highsmith book and Minghella's screenplay) and so well acted, that the character does something that movies rarely do these days: contain realism, but maintain a sense of movie-like fantasy to him, so we're not bothered with the &quot;hey, i've done that before!&quot; acknowledgement.  Thankfully the rest of the characters are just as interesting.  Jude Law (following the equally brilliant 1997 film Gattaca) yet again plays a man whose identity is taken from him.  He pulls off the accent greatly, and at first, you might wonder, shouldn't the pretty-looking Law play Ripley and the toughboy Damon play Dickie?  Soon though comes the realization that Law and Damon are Great Actors, capable of both star power and acting their parts convincingly against type.  In addition to the rich character development, the atmosphere and cinemotography of the lavish European vacationing lifetsyle that Minghella sets up is lush and inviting, and when Ripley and Greenleaf are out on the boat together, it stirs a chill that feels genuine and earned.
044022425X|5.0|I NEVER read romance books, and after Gabaldon's books were recommended to me, I was more than a little leary when the clerk led me down the romance aisle. I'm a writer myself--mostly southern literary fiction--and the way Gabaldon molds her characters and designs the plots prove that these books are not bodice-ripping romances, although Claire's bodice does get ripped several times. All the books are a melding of historical fiction, literary fiction and mainstream. Having Scottish ancestry, I have had my interest piqued regarding Scotland just from reading these books, especially Outlander. The concept of time travel sort of makes one consider the possibility of that occurrence. My great-grandmother was a french immigrant, and although I've never been in a formal french class, I can read french enough to get the main idea and can speak it somewhat. So Gabaldon makes the reader consider the possibilities of supernatural things. The only complaint I have is that there seems to be so many things which happen to Jamie and Claire--one right after the other--which are bad, that I'd like to go along for awhile and see them living a happy family life with somewhat of a twist in plot. Otherwise,these books are destined to become classics!

B00003CXAY|5.0|This is a message movie, but what seperates this from other message movies is that this film tells you nothing... but it shows you so much.  It's relevance has only increased since it's initial release almost twenty years ago.  Unfortunately the DVD is still out of print.  It is possible to obtain a genuine DVD by making a donation to the organization that produced the film.  It's not cheap but it will help them finally put it back in print so that others can easily order a copy from ...  Do an ... search for Koyaanisqatsi... ...  The DVD looks fantastic.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Although the film looks dated,&quot;Black Christmas&quot;,is easily one of the most unnerving,chilling,and horrific cinematic experiences ever created.It strikes at the core of what terrifies us the most,being terrorized in our own homes or dwellings,our last refuge from the evils of the world.To add to the terror and intensity,the homicidal maniac stalking the young ladies in the sorrority has multiple personality disorder,shifting abruptly between sorrow,anger,hatred,sexual excitement,fear,and pure rage.The phone calls he makes illustrate how deep his psychosis is,it's obvious he's not recovering anytime soon,and the only way he feels he can relieve the pain is to destroy the hate object,which in this film is Women.This is the rare film that gets under your skin and stays there long after it's conclusion.I saw this on television in 1976,and it still gives me chills,i still have this intense feeling of dread with regards to attics,and i'm sure you will too after seeing this.Much has been said about Margot Kidder's performance,and although it is effective,Olivia Hussey is the real foundation to the film.As the independent,intelligent,courageous,mature young woman she's the xcellent counterpoint to the sexual repressed,immature,childlike,developmentally disabled homicidal maniac.I highly recommend this classic of the Horror/Suspense/Thriller genre,but i would also suggest waiting to see if Anchor Bay will be releasing this in a special edition with extras.From the edition details it seems the DVD only consists of the film itself.
B000001DTM|5.0|I am 9 years old and yesterday I bought my first CD ever, Achtung Baby.  My life will never be the same again.  I am a huge U2 fan and this is my favorite U2 CD ever.

If you want to become a U2 fan, i suggest getting this CD, Achtung Baby!

B00005R2M3|4.0|Strangely, I really like this album. At first, I only bought it for \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and then I was like \\"I should listen to the other songs since I bought this whole album\\". When I first listened to it I was like \\"I can't believe I wasted my money on this ...! I shoulda just brought the single!\\". And I was very mad that I wasted good money that I coulda been buying Jessica Simpson's album with.<BR>     Now, for no reason, I kept the album and listened to it a couple a times. I realize the song \\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\" was very catchy, I kept singing it and I love dancing to it.<BR>     So now I had two reasons to keep the album.<BR>     Next I started listening to \\"Objection (Tango\\" and that was a song that I loved to dance to. The tango is a dance I suddenly have to learn.<BR>     So now I had three reasons to keep the album.<BR>     Then I heard the Spanish version of \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and I keep singing the spanish version more than the english version, and I know I'm not pronouncing the words right.<BR>     So now I had four reasons to keep the album.<BR>     <BR>     The rest of the album did NOT  give me my money's worth, but the 4 songs I like were so unbelievably catchy I rate this album 4 stars out of 5. <br />     Despite the songs I don't like. Shakira still has a good talent of singing, she can sing better than some female latin singers I've been listening to. Shakira la reina de latina musica.<br />     As for the title of my review \\"Laundry Service?\\" I just think the album name is weird. Hehe.
B00005RYKU|5.0|This movie was just gleck.  It stunk.  Don't waste your money renting or buying it.  It is not even halfway decent and the ending is boring instead of suspenseful.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and was surprised when I found I enjoyed it- the action genre usually leaves something to be desired, in my opinion... and I normally can't stand Keanu Reeves.  Laurence Fishburne does a marvelous job as Morpheus, and the Wachowski brothers spin a tale so engrossing and believable that you may look at your whole world a little differently afterwards- it leaves the viewer to do a lot of philosophical insight.

B00005JKHP|4.0|Paramount brought back Star Trek in the form of a big budget motion picture in 1979 with the orginal cast intact (unlike todays method of recasting roles with younger actors).  Reception of the film was lukewarm, which was understandable, it was very slow paced, but the story was pretty good, the set design and special effects were awesome, and the music score was just plain breathtaking. To try and quicken the pace director Robert Wise has trimmed the film down (as well as added a few of the scenes from the televised version) and added a few new special effects.  These changes do improve the film slightly, but not at the level to generate the amount of hype this dvd has received.  The changes are not as noticable as those in the Star Wars rereleases of 1997, and no new scenes have been added save the footage already presented in the 1983 televised version.  Nevertheless watching the film again is fun, and the special features are wonderful, particularly the featurette on Star Trek: Phase II, a cancelled television series that was the seeds from which this film, along with Star Trek: The Next Generation sprang.  Star Trek: The Next Generation fans should take particular interest in this film was probably a prototype of what Gene Roddenbury was hoping Star Trek: The Next Generation to be.  Even dialogue from the film was repeated in the pilot.

079213690X|5.0|If you haven't seen Braveheart yet, I highly suggest it.  Something in the story struck a chord with me.  I saw it seven times in the theater (okay, so I was a teenager at the time with much time to waste), and rented it twice more before buying the two-tape set.  In fact, when I loaned it to someone who didn't return it, I went out and bought it again, only this time on widescreen.  Now I don't loan it out anymore.<BR>This movie is a true story about William Wallace, a man in medieval Scotland who wanted to free his land from British control.  The king of England is truly evil, Willam's loves are breathtaking and heartbreaking as well, and his friends are by turns loyal and traitors.<BR>The cinematography is beautiful, and Mel Gibson really should direct more films, as he really has an eye for the job.<BR>All in all, a film well worth its Best Picture Oscar.
B00000JG4N|5.0|Some of the best guitar rifs and singing by vince niel since shouot at the devil!  Tommy Lee's drumming is amazing!
0451167716|5.0|I picked this book up for someone else and, bored, decided to check out the first page to see what it was like.  The first page got me hooked.  The expansive, even soap oprah like quality of the book is addictive.  The reader can't wait to get to the end to find out what happens, but at the same time doesn't want it to end.  Puzo sets up the Corleone family wonderfully, and Micheal's predicament, torn between his disgust for what his family does, and his loyalty to it in times of distress.  Filled with twists and turns this book is unforgetable.  I even found this to be better than the Godfather movie.  That film was great, but it couldn't hold all aspects of the story this book tells.  This film sent me racing watch the film version, its' sequels, and the book sequel, The Sicillian.  This is certainly a must read.
B000059QY3|5.0|This gorgeous opera is given a wonderful treatment in this terrific DVD.  Of course, the music is splendid-  probably Verdi's most beautiful score.  For me, the first act is the most perfect 30 minutes of music ever. And it gets its full due here.<br />This is a filming of the Covent Garden, London show with the, then new, Angela Gheorghiu in 1994.  Now she's a superstar.And this production is one of the reasons why.  She is spectacular as the dying Violetta.  Her tone, acting, and beauty make her unforgettable in this role.  The rest of the cast is also fine.  And it's hard to believe that this was the first time that the venerable George Solti had ever directed &quot;La Traviata.&quot;  That's amazing.  And, of course, he is wonderful.<br />As for the DVD itself, the sound (5.1) is perfect, and so is the filming of the production.  The booklet has an OK essay, and a good synopsis of the opera.  It also has a helpful listing of all chapters so you can find a specific place in the score. And, of course, sub-titles.  No extra features, but you rarely find them on opera discs.<br />All in all an excellent package.  Give me more like this.
B000005ALP|4.0|You cannot turn your back on the trio know as the eels, their music is played on nearly every modern 'hip' film you watch, example: Road Trip.<BR>I think their best album is this one and I always listen to it when stressed out, or in a mood, it is really relaxing and chilled out and 'Novcaine for the soul' and 'Susan's House' are the most noticeable and likeable tracks on the album.<BR>The Eels? Love 'em.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt's latest, Rock Steady, is brilliant.  No Doubt always has an incredible knack for creating fresh, catchy tunes, and this album is no exception.  They combine all sorts of crazy genres into one album, creating an album that is truly unique.  There's pop, there's rock, there's R &amp; B, there's reggae, there's disco, there's electronica...and more, all combined with the flair of No Doubt that makes every one of their albums a great listen.  The lyrics are great, as usual, and I honestly play the CD over and over again.  I can't get enough of it.  The end of the CD has me craving more.
6304711875|5.0|I definitely recommend Scream, it's the best scary movie out there. I have watched it millions of times and I'm still not tired of it!! It has good acting, kill scenes, and a plot where you have no idea who the killer is until the very end.  It makes fun of scary movies within a scary movie, which I think takes skill to pull off correctly. If you haven't bought it yet, I suggest you go right now and watch it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|wow...I've been reading the people's reviews who trashed this movie, and I cannot possibly relate or understand. I think this is the best movie to be created in years!!! I think it hands-down deserves to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but fear it will be robbed. After watching the closing credits in the theater, I said that I wanted to buy a dvd player just because of this movie. I have never written a review, but I had to speak up to say how awesome(literally) this film is.<br />From the credits directed by a conductor to the flashback pan shot of Paris accompanied by a backwards piano, Baz Luhrmann has covered every detail.  It is the most creative piece of filming I have ever seen. He mixes film genres and music styles and pulls it off completely.  It's a comedy. It's a drama. It's a love story. It's a musical. It's campy. It's visually stunning. It's hilarious. It's sad. I have NEVER seen a movie like this (and I see lots of movies)!<br />The principles are universal--truth * beauty * freedom * love.  It has a fantastic message which we all should be reminded of (especially after 9-11)...&quot;the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and to be loved in return.&quot; <br />I hope that people will view this film with an open mind...you'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll appreciate life and love a whole lot more.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is one of those hugely overrated movies that had me grabbing for an aspirin once the end credits started to roll. To start off, everything in this movie was shamelessly stolen from somewhere else. The screenwriters deserve an Oscar for sheer gall and an arrest for Grand Theft Cinema, having embezzled the entire story from countless movies we've already seen. Every other line was lifted from a contemporary song, and the scene where Christian throws money at Satine was brazenly filched from the opera \\"La Traviata.\\"<br />The cookie-cutter characters, which all look like they too have been stolen from other movies, are one-dimensional and flat, making it impossible to care about what happens to them. Ewan McGregor's Christian is the formulaic idealistic writer, Nicole Kidman's Satine is the stereotypical courtesan-with-a-heart-of-gold, and Richard Roxburgh's Duke is the hackneyed villain. Every plot development is telegraphed far in advance, making every supposed twist and turn drearily anticipated. <br />The cinematography made me dizzy. With the camera view jumping from shot to shot to shot, the movie feels like it was edited in a blender. In several scenes, the continual shot jumps forced me to close my eyes to avoid nausea. The bass was turned up so high I was grabbing for the audio controls to stop my head from pounding. The movie resembled nothing more than a two-hour music video that would be right at home on MTV, where viewers have somehow become adapted to this method of filmmaking. <br />Now for the decent parts: the costuming and sets are undeniably very good. The dancers' peek-a-boo costumes do the job of showing enough skin to titillate the audience while still staying within the realm of a PG-13 rating. Much of the music is also very well done, although the \\"Like a Virgin\\" number made me cringe. And Nicole Kidman unquestionably oozes sex through every pore, making her a good choice for Satine. In general, the actors are good at what they do - it's just that they didn't have a whole lot to work with.<br />This movie might have been nicely cheesy brain candy. Instead, so much of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is so derivative and so dizzying that it is more an endurance marathon than a movie.
B00005JKHP|3.0|This version of ST:TMP has been trimmed and massaged to the point where the average viewer will probably no longer find it dull. Unfortunately, the changes destroy the lulling atmosphere of the previous versions. ST:TMP used to be a 2001-style piece of ambient filmmaking that was really, really good at two in the morning with all the lights out; this version...isn't.<br />Trivial example: they have revised the ambient sound design.  The Enterprise bridge sequences now sport the beeps and chirps that are associated with the original TV series.   This would be nice except that said happy little beeps are used even when the atmosphere of a given scene is supposed to be awesome and portentous.  They don't fit; they detract.<br />The major problem with the DVD as a DVD is the terrible menu design; it not only requires the use of all the arrow keys on the remote, it forces one to view flashy visual effects sequences when going from feature to feature. This, as the saying goes, gets old real fast. Paramount should release a revised edition with the menus redesigned (consider the design of APOLLO 13), and add the capacity to view the other versions of the film through seamless branching. Oh, and Paramount? fix the opening titles again -- that blur-in effect is hard on the eyes.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  A number of reviewers here and elsewhere have spent a inordinate amount of space finding fault with Paul's lyrics.  They're misguided.  McCartney's music has never been about great, tightly woven stories with sharp, inventive phrases. At his best, it is his honesty, conviction and emotional connection to his song subjects and his great melodic skill that makes his music special. <BR>I'm happy to say that he has never sounded more connected and energized than he does in Drivin Rain.  If anyone needed more evidence that Sir Paul can rock, after his album, the defense rests.  Musically, this is a muscular album that gives each song space to make its point. It is also bursting with a high level of creativity and musicianship that you weren't sure Paul was capable of reaching. Much of the credit has to go to David Kahane who has done an excellent job of producing an album that showcases Paul's voice and musical inventiveness while preserving the spontaneity that good rock requires. The sound is usually dense and loud...at times it almost sounds like a live recording. McCartney's bass playing on this record should be required listening for bassists everywhere.  This is McCartney like he oughta be. <BR>In fact, this album could almost be a summary of the many diverse musical styles that has made up McCartney's output over his long career. If he were to call it quits right now, he couldn't do much better than to end it with this record. But right now, I hope he never stops.
0792156684|4.0|I find this film neither underrated or overrated. It's either hated or loved. The reason it's hated is because a bunch of teenage boys are jealous that their little premiscuous girlfriends fell in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, or these little &quot;history buffs&quot; that whine that the damn movie wasn't accurate. So? Nor was the love story, you morons! You people need to get real and learn not every movie based on historical fact is going to be 100% accurate. I suppose you've never seen HENRY: Portrait of a Serial Killer, totally based on the serial killer Henry Lee Lucas....that wasn't accurate to the real guy at all. Think before you speak, numbnuts.
B00004TA41|5.0|This disc was recorded only a few months before Coltrane's death; though there are a few later discs, this one remains the great man's most satisfying farewell, &amp; it's one of the few &quot;late Coltrane&quot; albums (read: radically avantgarde music) that has appeal for the less intrepid listener too.  Sonically, it's quite gorgeous: Coltrane's tenor (only tenor--no multi-instrumentalism here) is now quite different from when he was playing with Tyner, Garrison &amp; Jones: it's warmer &amp; thicker in sound, with much more vibrato.  (I would imagine that Albert Ayler's sound was a major influence here.)  The only other player is Rashied Ali, who contributes highly coloured drum parts, whether on sticks or brushes.  Each track opens &amp; closes almost ceremonially, with Coltrane ringing bells before turning to the saxophone.  The absence of a bassist opens the music up texturally; there's little need for one, anyhow, given Coltrane's iron harmonic &amp; thematic grip on his material: you'll never hear a more lucid demonstration on how to construct long improvisations out of the simplest materials.  This rarely steps out into atonal territory, but Coltrane does tend to build his solos around explorations of &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;freak&quot; notes on the horn, most memorably on &quot;Venus&quot;, which begins as almost a hymn, before building into a series of increasingly elaborate runs at ever-higher &quot;false&quot; notes on the scale.<br />This is radiant, profound music that, unlike much late Coltrane, is eminently approachable.  Those who enjoy it should seek out Evan Parker &amp; Eddie Prevost's _Most Materiall_ (Matchless), a 2-CD set of duets in the same sax/drums format; Parker is like the moon to Coltrane's sun, but it's clear that disc 2 was recorded with _Interstellar Space_ very much in mind.
0887306101|5.0|Insightful interviews with the greatest traders &amp; investors of our time. This one is much better than the Money Masters books. Market Wizards taught me that success in trading was more than just luck, as the efficient market people would say and my finance classes at Brown taught. There is skill, education, and a level of learned maturity involved. <br />This is another book I re-read constantly to get inspiration and tips to succeed as an investor.
B00005QG9J|5.0|At first, Incubus seems like somewhat of light girlie alternative rockers but after listening to &quot;Morning View&quot; and songs like &quot;Blood On the Ground&quot;, &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; and &quot;Are You In?&quot; I hear Incubus has depth and life in their art.
B00004U8H4|4.0|I love this film, since I love the eighties. The music was wonderful, Christian Bale's portrayal as the schmuck businessman who whines about his life yet gets paid to sit on his ... and do nothing was comical. And Reese Witherspoon was definitely entertaining as the idiot fiancee of Patrick Bateman. Rent it before you buy it. NR version is worth owning, though it's just 10 long seconds more of the threesome scene.

B00005NWM3|5.0|This is a very pleasing rock and roll cd.  Every song is enjoyable and has a wonderful beat.  The first single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is just a preview of just how wonderful this cd is.  Yes, all the songs do sound the same, but they each have their awesome beat.  There is not one bad song on this cd and has very minimal cuss words.  I highly recommend this cd.  If you like &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, you will surely love the rest of the cd!!
B00005QDW1|2.0|This is No Doubt's worst CD to date. It isn't worth the hour, the fourteen bucks, or the electricity. Their older stuff is so much better than this, wich is suddenly low grade hip-hop. I am dissapointed.

B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt's new sound is radically different from the sound of their previous albums at many points in this album, but I think that can be a good thing.  Bands that don't change often end up producing music that sounds very similar album after album (err, Metallica anyone?).  No Doubt experimented with electronica and new wave in this album, and it gives the album a feel that's very different from just about anything else on the music scene right now.  The album sounds different than anything No Doubt has produced before, but for most if it, it still feels like No Doubt, just like Return of Saturn sounded different but felt the same.  The CD excels at the faster songs like &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Platinum Blond Life.&quot;  While Return of Saturn's ballads tended to be hauntingly beautiful, the drippy reggae-esque slower songs like &quot;Rock Steady&quot; tend to be a just that, drippy.  Some of the more interestingly styled and fun songs include &quot;In My Head&quot; and &quot;Waiting Room&quot;  I like this CD.  No Doubt is making music that sounds different than anything else on the market, and that's what No Doubt's always been about.  With No Doubt, Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn, they produced unique sounding music that stood out in a sea of similarity that surrounds them.  Rock Steady continues that.
B000002NHN|5.0|Aftering wearing out my first copy of this CD, I had to buy another one because I so longed to hear these beloved songs again.  My personal favorites on this CD are:  &quot;Night Ride Across the Caucasus&quot; (which makes me envision a beautiful woman furiously riding a white horse along the water's edge at nightfall) and &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; (which I wouldn't mind having played at my memorial service someday).  These songs are haunting, yet at the same time, comforting. The songs are so inspiring and get my creative juices flowing. I listen to this CD and others from Ms. McKennitt while doing my sketches and artwork, with a glass of good wine close at hand.  After a hectic day, this CD slows me down and refocuses my energy.  My whole family loves this music.  I highly recommend this CD to everyone.

Read the first 2 pages and couldn't put it down but thought I will go around to look at other books and forget about it. But couldn't leave without buying it. I read it over 2 days and got a lot of laughs out of it.Keep them coming Mr. Grisham!!!
0790729628|5.0|Okay, I got bored so I thought I'd review my favourite movie on Amazon. I thought I'd look through to see what was being said about it, and I'm a little stupefied. Here are the reason's it's my favourite movie of all time, especially the director's cut.<br />1 - Ambiguity and uncertainty are good. If you need a stupid voice-over to tell you what to think, go watch football.<br />2 - If it turned out in the director's cut that Deckard was a &quot;replicant&quot; and you thought that takes away his &quot;humanity&quot; and makes him &quot;bad&quot; then you're a very stupid person and you missed the point of the entire movie. It's the homo sapiens that are the villains.<br />3 - It is not a &quot;futuristic detective movie&quot;. It is a philosophical examination of the nature of humanity. Just because it looks noir-ish, it doesn't mean it's actually noir.<br />4 - If you want a happy ending, why are you watching such a patently dark movie?<br />5 - I love the book &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;. This isn't the book, it doesn't even have the same name. It's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and it's a movie. Don't compare them, enjoy them separately. Incidentally, you literary pedants, Philip K. Dick himself said he was most impressed with what he saw of the movie before he died.<br />Okay, I too want a better DVD. I don't NEED extras, or even any kind of 5.1 Surround (but bring it on!), but the audio balance is bizarre and fluctuates, and the ragged edges of the print are a little sub-standard. I DO want anamorphic widescreen, and I DO want the dirt gone fron the print.

B00005RIKD|5.0|Sting just gets better with age.  Last year I purchased Sting's Brand New Day CD and loved it. I just had to have the All This Time Live CD since it included many of his older songs such as Don't Stand So Close To Me; Roxanne &amp; If You Love Somebody Set Them Free. I was curious as to how these older songs would now sound especially Live.  What a surprise, the new sound is jazzier and more interesting. One of my favorite songs is Brand New Day and both versions (original and this version) are so good. Sting experiments with many musical styles and somehow pulls it off where so many others have failed. This is one great Sting CD.
B00005RIKD|4.0|I have alway liked Sting &amp; the Police, but have never felt compelled to purchase a CD by him, until now.  9/11 is being described as the day the world stopped turning, and indeed, it did feel like everything came to a screeching halt.  But Sting decided to go on with the show, which undoubtedly was a way for him to deal with the events of the day.  But, even though the show went on, there was something different about it, just like everything else that day, and you can hear it here.  If you're a Sting fan, you probably already own this disc.  But, even if you're not typically someone who &quot;goes for&quot; his music, you should give this a listen. What you'll hear is great.  What you'll feel will be even better.  My rating would have been 4 1/2 stars if they allowed halves.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I had only heard How You Remind Me when I decided to take a chance and buy this CD. I thought that I would only like the catchy radio single, I'd listen to it until I got sick of it and then let the CD start collecting dust. I thought wrong. Honestly, there is not a bad song on this CD. From the hard sounds of the first track Never Again, to the melancholy notes of the final cut Good Times Gone, Nickelback entertains with straight ahead guitar rifts and thought provoking lyrics.   <BR>If you're a rock fan or a fan of good music in general, stop reading and buy this CD...I promise you won't be disappointed.

B00005U4UV|5.0|I think this is one of the scariest movies ever made.  Just the idea of bringing dead things back to life gives most people the creeps.  Jeffrey Combs does a great job of playing an obcessed college student who invents an injectable serum to &quot;re-animate&quot; dead tissue.  It has a very surreal quality to it that will make you think you're &quot;loosing it&quot; from time to time.  This is a &quot;must see&quot; for the horror movie lover!!
0780627024|5.0|This movie is a breakthrough on almost every level.  It's constantly admirable, different and beautiful to watch.  In it we see a pair of twins (played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) transported into a 50's black-and-white TV show called 'Pleasantville'.  There they are forced to take on the personas of Budd and Betty-Sue.  Yet the black-and-white world on drab 'Pleasantville' is injected with colour by the modern ideas that the kids bring with them.<br />This movie takes a totally different look at the old-fashioned family values of the era whilst showing how unrealistic and restraining they are, whilst making gentle fun out of it at the same time.  For example, a group of men stand around aghast at a man's shirt that has been burnt by the iron, with one protester exclaiming 'what's next?' incredulously.  The central idea is lovely to watch as we see the world transform into colour - cherry blossom, roses andrain all impinging on the dull lifestyle of the town.  Not only that but it's effortlessly clever, with the 'coloureds' eventually being forced aside, rock 'n' roll being banned, and imaginative fiction being burnt.  It is also truly inspirational, with our heroes being given a free rein to do what they like, to please themselves for once.  In such a liberated world, the geeky character can be the hero, the shallow girl can get her education and the housewife can follow her heart.  Whilst this often-done theme of remaining true to yourself is often handled wrongly, 'Pleasantville' gets it just right.<br />Not only that but thanks to some truly excellent performances from a fantastic cast - including Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels and William H Macy - it is often incredibly touching.  It's simply wonderful, with everything balanced just right: there's never too much schamltz and it's not too preachy either.  Sublime.
6303212379|5.0|this movie is by far my favorite movie of all time. i first saw it when i was about 9 years old and begged my mom to buy it for me. i am now 17 and i can honestly say i have watched the goonies at least 15 times in the past 2 weeks. i just keep on rewinding and watching it over and over. there isn't a scene in the movie i get bored with. this is a great movie for any person young or old. there isn't a doubt in my mind that it will always be my favorite.
B00004STPT|4.0|imagine my suprise when, viewing a dead can dance discography, i spotted the cover of the gladiator soundtrack mixed in with other dcd titles. immediately i realized why the evocative music of gladiator had always stirred some faint memory within me. zimmer and gerard, for those who didn't know, are the core of the goth group dead can dance. so this review is less a review of the actual cd, but a personal memo of my own delight at seeing one of my favorite groups so publicly extolled.
0792839749|4.0|One of the purposes of the DVD is to restore a movie so it can be seen in its original theatrical release.  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a great family movie musical and the DVD version is released in standard format.  Someone got lazy here and it is seen on DVD as it is shown on network televsion.  Its too bad, because widescreen adds so much to a movie and it would have added more to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.Note: Look for Benny Hill as the Bulgarian toymaker.<br />Postscript/Edit review Nov 18-03: The Special Edition DVD will be released in both fomats (Widescreen/Pan and Scan). From most of the reviews I've read of the current DVD, the complaint was that it was not released in Widescreen.  Someone at MGM/UA must have heard about the complaints and rectified the situation.  I originally gave the DVD (not the film itself, because this is a great film musical starring Dick Van Dyke) 2 stars, but the movie deserved 4--and please ignore the title of review. Thank you MGM/UA, Sknayfan-03!
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is a film that may take you by surprise due to the fact that it's excellence lives up to the high expectations that the hype surrounding it has created for it. I went in curious and excited, but wondering how a biopic could be that intriguing. What I found interesting about it is that I didn't know what part of the film to pay attention to: the story, the acting, the gorgeous cinematography and color scheme, or the score.  Each seems to be a creature of its own and it's almost too much to try and incorporate them into one film and accept them all at once.<br />As a film though, this one succeeds at a new level. Howard's style is engrossing and make the subject matter -Math, John Forbes Nash, and Schizophrenia- interesting. There's a scene when Nash tells his girlfriend (to-be wife) to pick a shape, he then proceeds to find that pattern in the sky, and Howard shows us what he sees. You are instantly made part of the film. In fact, Howard continually and ceaselessly shows us what Nash sees, which brings us into a different world; and this leads to a new portion of the storyline and integration with the rest of the film, though we may not know it. Nash's genius consists of the fact that he can see patterns in almost everything, leading him to be obsessively preoccupied with everything around him, we see what he sees. This contributes to his schizophrenia when he sees hallucinations, which we as an audience believe are real until we learn what is and what isn't. When he doubts, we doubt. It's an incredible way to keep us hooked, but not the only thing.<br />The performances in this film are singularly marvelous. Watching Russell Crowe is like watching a little child in awe. He mumbles and does little hand motions and talks to himself and slumps and frowns and grins and looks like he has three hundred things whizzing around in his mind all at once. He's mezmerizing, and his body language and complete intensity makes up for his rather annoyingaccent. Jennifer Connelly, I believe, is the shining star of this film due to the fact that she doesn't have such the weight of stardom on her shoulders, but her performance is completely realistic and her subtlety and strength powerfully drive the character into a realm where any bit of a lesser actress would have failed miserably.<br />And though it may not be as important, I feel that I must comment on it. The score by James Horner is beautiful. Due to the score, the beginning of the film, as in as soon as the film starts, is excellent. You wonder where it's going and where it'll start. It keeps the intensity and it's lushness throughout the film and only heightens the experience. Along side John Williams Harry Potter score this is the best score of the year, one of the best i've ever heard. Not to mention the outstanding costumes which looked incredibly comfortable, or the world that the cinematography evoked. You could feel each breeze, the rain, and the warmth in each scene.<br />This is a fantastic film, and I daresay it grew on me. I went out of one mode into this unusual world of academics and insanity and basically lost myself in a way I never expected to in a drama.
0804102988|5.0|This lengthy novel consists of a series of vignettes which bring the history of Sarum (Salisbury, England) to life. A good read for any Anglophile.
B00005JKES|5.0|I am not sure how any fan can get all upset about the missing pilot. This DVD is very well put together and I can't wait to share it with all my friends that missed out on this wonderful series while it was on. I should hope all fans will buy this DVD as this will insure that the rest of the episodes are one day given the same treatment. I see now that the IMPORT Pilot DVD is now listed on Amazon for $15. I had already purchased one on Ebay for $15 including shipping. The Import may not be as well produced as this collector's set but it IS readily available for less than $20. Thank you to everyone involved in making this DVD release a reality!
6305229449|3.0|Everything about this movie smacks of Disney formula. Eddie Murphy as the wisecracking sidekick dragon is enjoyable. Mulan is likeable. All the other characters are one-dimensional, straight out of the stockroom.<br />The &quot;be a girl&quot; and &quot;honor&quot; themes are introduced as ham-handedly as possible. After that, it gets down to the business of unfolding the inevitable plot. Sometimes it is comforting to know that there are no shocks ahead. It's a pleasant, straightforward story, but has nothing to really make it stand out in your memory.
0446677450|4.0|It was interesting to read about how money making is easy if you change the way you think about money.  He puts his focus on the difference between the Rich Dad's and the Poor Dad's beliefs with many examples from his life experiences.  Although he is repetitive, his points are made clear. It is filled with a lot of common sense, which lets you realize how to make use of them.  Read this book and it will change the way you think about money.
B00000IL1K|4.0|I'll confess that I never heard of Sarah Brightman until I saw A TV commerical for her &quot;Classics&quot; CD.  I was entranced, and immediately went online to Amazon.com to see if it was available there.  It was, along with Eden, and others by Ms. Brightman.  I bought three Brightman CDs right then and there! The songs on &quot;Eden&quot; are a good sampling of Ms. Brightman's talent, and I strongly recommend it for anyone who loves the crystalline sound of a truly pure soprano voice!
0385501005|5.0|Good sense of humor.<BR>Light yet insightful.
B00005O5CM|3.0|This Hollywood vehicle for bigger-than-life actress (though it's p.c. now to say &quot;actor&quot; instead) Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly polished and funny, not the mindless hackwork one might expect from its marketing campaign.  The story is shamelessly derivative, true, with obvious nods to THE PAPER CHASE, MY COUSIN VINNIE, CLUELESS, and, it's easy to imagine, any number of other movies I've missed.  No matter:  It's a hoot, and works fine on its own terms.<br />It's entertainingly written, capably directed, and uniformly well-crafted in every area: acting, casting (several of the bit players are dead-on), costuming, set design, cinematography, editing.  Not a &quot;deep&quot; film, but fun, with some hip, timely satire.<br />Extras include a nice documentary short plus two different audio commentaries that provide considerable insight as to how a Hollywood production like this is put together.  All in all, terrific light entertainment for the intelligent viewer.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is a must for action fans of any kind, fast pace, great action scenes, this movie will surprise you that it doesn't take 100 million to make a great movie. Using new actors also gives this movie a fresh perspective. This is whole movie, story and action combined, instead of one or the other like in some movies. You have to give big credit to Rob Cohen director of the movie, he made it happen. Hope to see more like this.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is a powerful Score.A Great movie too. Jurassic Park is probably one of best soundtracks out there. Jurassic Park is an Great addition to the collection of any fan of John Williams so give the music the attention it deserves. Now to the &quot;not so good stuff&quot; There is not one bad track on the entire soundtrack. <BR>The track &quot;Theme From Jurassic Park&quot; repeats over... and over again... come on!. The Theme in tracks 4,7,13,15,15, <BR>is best theme in the movie. John Williams did an excellent job.<BR>A great soundtrack a &quot;gotta have&quot; for any John Williams fan!.<BR>brilliant music!.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I must say that everything about the new Lord of the Rings movie is totally awesome, and the soundtrack was a huge contribution. Every piece of music perfectly matched the scene it was set for. Every piece was completely original and flowed well. Howard Shore proved once again that he can interpret a movie with grace as well as precision.<br />Many people I know have compared this soundtrack to that of Star Wars Episode One, but I for one have to say that Williams' work is nothing compared to this. I mean, let's face it; John Williams hasn't done anything original or completely noteworthy in the past decade.
B000000OEI|5.0|Longtime Zimmer fans will love the terrific score that<BR>blows away Basil Poledouris' score for The Hunt For Red October. Well don't get me wrong The Hunt For Red October<BR>is over all not bad. This is probably one of the greatest themes that Zimmer has done.  They got The London Symphony Orchestra to perform it.  If you want a good theme,there is no better<BR>soundtrack to get by Hans Zimmer. This is one fantastic CD.<BR>The track &quot;Roll Tide&quot;, is a very bold, rousing and awesome<BR>masterpiece of music. It has plenty of cool themes. There are only five tracks on the soundtrack but it runs for over 60 minutes.  I also recommend The Hunt For Red October and  Gladiator.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Why, oh why, is there such a hub-bub surrounding such a band?  Are &quot;The Strokes&quot; a good band?  Yes.  Do they produce good rock &amp; roll songs?  Yes.  Are they the future of rock &amp; roll?  Who knows?  I certainly prefer The Strokes to the likes of the  current &quot;rock&quot; movements filled with Nu Metal poseurs and Rock/Rap oppurtunists.  The Strokes may not have the indie cred of other bands, but that's fine.  The Strokes have yet to do anything truly novel or inventive, but I don't think they ever said they did.  They produce hook filled rock songs which are fun to dance to and easy to sing along with.  &quot;Is This It&quot; didn't forever alter rock and roll, but it did make it sort of fun again (and with currently popular bands like Mudvayne, Slip Knot, etc., that's really saying something).  Julian may not be nearly as hip as he makes himself out to be, but I don't listen to bands because they think they're cool.  I listen to bands because I enjoy their music.  The Strokes aren't out to change the world or start a revolution.  It's about time we have a rock band that just wants to have a good time.
0425152251|1.0|I'm interested in philosophy so i thought I might enjoy this book. But it got very boring after a while. It's presented in a very boring fashion.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have listened to this cd over and over again and I have yet to grown tired of it like most &quot;Pop&quot; cds.  I have like No Doubt since the beginning but never got around to buying one of their cds and I am glad I finally chose to get this one!  I think it is great, Gwen's voice is awesome, and, as opposed to what one reviewer stated, I think the group did have a say in this cd.  By the way, I am also a fan of the reggae stuff they added into the cd.  I am not one to buy a reggae cd or even listen to a reggae song but I definately enjoyed the mix between No Doubt and Reggae
B000002WYT|2.0|The late '90s and the early part of the new century has been full of mediocre artists and performers only doing manufactured, processed music. Bands who can play instruments even sacrifice their individuality to get success on the charts. One day, there will be one band that will pull everybody away from that trend and into the real world with real music. <br />This band may well be that chosen band to do that. They might as well be the Dave Matthews Band. With their unique lineup (a conventional trio with a saxophonist and violinist.) and individuality conveyed with their constistently engaging music, <BR>this group can be enjoyable. For the most part, the Dave Matthews Band shows on CRASH that they can play their instruments, and play them well.<br />But that's not the problem. CRASH's problem lies in the songwriting camp. A dedicated music listener can recognize within CRASH's instrumental passages lie flaws: usually the bass lines seem juggled and senseless. And though the instrumentation is complex, it follows the juggled bass lines. Many of CRASH's songs lack hooks and many of these song's lyrics don't make much sense and are overly contrived. <br />That's weird, because more than half of the tunes off UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING were catchy and enjoyable. CRASH, however, doesn't boast that, despite a big, focused production by Steve Lilywhite. <br />CRASH does have its moments, however, even with eight of its twelve songs out in the drink. &quot;#41&quot; is a terrific, melodic song that could have been on UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING. &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; is sort of a progressive rock-country rock tune that cruises along. &quot;Crash Into Me,&quot; despite its weird title and kinky lyrics, is a pleasant ballad with a simple chord progression. &quot;Cry Freedom,&quot; almost sinks to the depths of the rest of CRASH but is saved by a kind of laid-back charm. <br />It's quite good that the Dave Matthews Band is making music and showing off their individuality. But after listening to CRASH after you listened to UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING, you will realize that the band is capable of much more. In fact, they would have had a classic on their hands only if they had written better songs.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I really wanted this cd when I heard a few of the strokes songs...I bought the cd and realized I had made a mistake.  I was looking forward to the seemingly different songs this group was said to have...if different means bad then they achieved being different.  My advice is not to waste your money unless you are sure you like the everyday &quot;we are different&quot; bands...
B000001FY9|5.0|These are his &quot;greatest hits&quot; on one cd. However if you would like to buy a more thorough assembly of his songs I would recommend the box-set Songs of Freedom, a chronological compilation of songs, (and you can do without legend.) Here is some other essential Bob Marley material- Babylon by Bus(live), LIVE (the Wailers first live album), Catch a Fire (first Wailers album),Rastaman Vibration.

0316776963|5.0|Although I struggled through the first few pages, I soon found myself laughing, crying and ROFL (rolling on the floor laughing) during Sedaris' descriptions of his life, his family and his travels (in France).  HIGH MARKS to this one.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys an irreverant journey through one man's life experience.
630416923X|5.0|If I needed some band to love, The Beatles are the ones that I've been thinking of.  This is 10 hours of the best band ever.  They played the best music, had the most exciting concerts, were the most creative, and the best part is -- all the footage you could ever want is right here.  Here's a quick run-down of the tapes:<br />#1:  The births of The Beatles, footage of Hamburg and the Cavern.<br />#2:  The first album, &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; on the Polladium and the Royal Variety Show.<br />#3:  The first trip to America, the first world tour, the substitute drummer Jimmy Nickel, and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; film.<br />#4:  Footage of the concert at the Hollywood Bowl, &quot;Help!&quot; film and recieving the MBE.<br />#5:  The historic Shea Stadium concert 8/15/65, the making of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver,&quot; clips from the Budokan concerts and the difficulty of playing the newer songs live.<br />#6:  The last concert at Candlestick Park 8/29/66, the making of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and Paul talking to the press about taking LSD.<br />#7:  The two films &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; the death of Bryan Epstein and the world-wide TV performasnce of &quot;All You Need is Love.&quot;<br />#8:  Footage of the group playing &quot;Let it Be,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; &quot;Revolution,&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; and the Apple rooftop gig.<br />And that is &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;
0790736233|5.0|I love this movie and my kids love this movie.  It really opens up your thoughts to our place in this universe and how small our planet really is and it will awaken any interest in astronomy.
0380973650|5.0|I first read Neil Gaiman in the Sandman comics from DC (seems like that was ages ago).  In American Gods, Neil draws you into a magical and utterly engrossing tale!  Funny, poignant and a true masterpiece!  If you like Neil's previous work or stories that mix fantasy and present day, you'll love this book!  Even if you don't like this genre you will enjoy this one!
B0000256KE|5.0|&quot;Had your fill of Quadrilles?&quot; &quot;Bored with the Beguine, the Samba isn't your thing?&quot;....... and so on. Bryan Ferry wrote some of the wittiest and most urbane lyrics in rock and roll. &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; was the group's second effort and it tops their excellent debut. Starting with the cover, you know that you are in for something out of the ordinary. Pictured is sex change superstar Amanda Lear wearing a skin tight black leather dress and walking a black panther towards Mr. Ferry who is leaning on a deep purple Cadillac dressed as a chauffeur while Las Vegas glitters in the background. Get the picture? Beauty Queens, inflatable dolls, plain wrapper babies, and heartaches in every dream home. It's an upscaled Ray Davies style attack on English complacency and alienation. Brian Eno was still around on this one and contributes some wonderful electronic noise. The remastering brings out all the subtle glory of a band that sounded like no one else ever could. A classic recording.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you get a Beatles album, either get this one or Sgt. Pepper.  This is my favorite Beatles album because it isn't as spaced out/experimental as Sgt. Pepper was, and tends to be more rock based.  Everyone seems to focus on their hits like &quot;Revolution&quot; or &quot;Birthday&quot;, but this double album is full of great songs that nobody really knows about. &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Rocky Racoon&quot;, and &quot;Yer Blues&quot; are good examples of this.  Do yourself a favor, and buy this album and listen to it all the way through.  It may take a while, but you'll be glad you did it!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The movie itself is such a wonderful Disney classic that appeals to such a wide audience.  This dvd is one of the best dvd's to own in my opinion!  There are so many extras on it!! and there is a whole other dvd with extras(havent' watched that yet!!!)<br />The first dvd has the movie, and documentaries on the making of the movie, music video(or movie clip, but Barbara STreisand singing &quot;some day my prince will come&quot;.  DVD is chock full of fun things to watch for the entire family!!!! All the added stuff is just as good as the movie itself. There is even a game, &quot;Dopey's mine ride&quot;(not the exact title but close enough), I had a blast playing that!! But you have to know the movie really really really well!!! Watch the movie a few times before playing.<br />I highly recommend picking this dvd up for your own personnal libarary, it is a great package and a great Disney classic.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I wasn't looking for meaningful plot or dialogue.  It was fun to watch.  Yes, the plot was a little thin, and the villain was obviously the villain, but so what.  It was entertaining and made me laugh and what else do you want in a movie?  Yes, we could have done without Daddy but he wasn't around all that much.  All in all, I am glad I bought it and will watch it again
6300213668|5.0|Grease has that very typical story line that many musicals have:<br />boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, loses girl again, does something radically different to get her,and then gets her back.<br />Olivia Newton John is Sandy, and John Travolta is Danny..the boy and girl of the story.<br />It's one my favorite movies of all time. A lot of the reviews here are very negative.  Some stating that the film has far too much sexual innuendo, and some people just go way into detail..<br />While Grease may have some sexual innuendo,(i didn't really know what that was at 9 when i first saw it), it may have people in it who are clearly not teenagers, but adults playing teenagers..but come on' fellow ... This is Grease we are talking about!!! It's a musical! It's certainly not made for children under the age of 9, but if kids younger than that are watching, I don't think they even notice that..it goes right over their heads while they sing and dance along with all the fun songs that grace the entire movie's soundtrack.<br />I think many of the reviewers here have taken Grease to seriously..It's one thing not to like this movie, which I know plenty of people who do...and that's fine...I will always love this movie.  I did at 9 years old when it came out..and I still love it now, 24 years later.  It is just pure fun to watch even if some of the characters do seem annoying at times(the t-birds), danny and kenickie are the t birds..the other guys are just three stooges rip offs.<br />I did like all of the pink ladies, and I think the best acting done was my the leader herself, Rizzo, played by the wonderfully talented actress, Stockard Channing.  John Travolta, Danny, who is charming, often looks bored and not happy to be in this movie, but I still love watching him careen across the floor during \\"Greased Lightening\\".  This is a movie that I can watch over and over.  Every time it comes on cable, I have to watch at least half of it. This movie has always been so entertaining for me and so fun to watch.  It's an \\"escape\\" from all the serious films.<br />This is a movie worth watching for fans of musicals, fans of Stockard Channing, Olivia Newton JOhn, or John Travolta, or just for people who like to have fun and be entertained in a very simplistic way.(Warning: you may start singing along as they break into song!)<br />And it's got a good ending...so fun to watch.  It's an \\"escape\\" from all the serious films. <BR>This is a movie worth watching for fans of musicals, fans of Stockard Channing, Olivia Newton JOhn, or John Travolta, or just for people who like to have fun and be entertained in a very simplistic way.(Warning: you may start singing along as they break into song!)<BR>And it's got a good ending...
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I guess I'd give this movie 3 1/2 stars if I could, some of the humor would be a little too adult for small kids and I didn't care for some of it either. I did like most of the characters and their voices, Shrek was one of the best. The computer animation was fantastic, much better than Final Fantasy, I thought you could almost think the characters were people in rubber suits. I think that I read the animators gave the people a little less than realistic movement in order to preserve the cartoon aspect, that seemed evident at times. The plot was predictable but then most movies since the beginning have been.
B000001FDK|5.0|This is definitely a must have c.d. for the big fans of the movie version of Grease.<br />All the songs that are performed in the film, are on this album.<br />I had the LP of this when the movie came out, I have no idea where it is so I had to buy the c.d. ...it is one of the few c.d.'s I own that I listen to repeatedly..it's also the most fun to listen to cuz I know the words to every song, and I have fun singing along to it while I am doing house work, or most recently, in my car, after a rough day, it was the perfect music to lift my spirits up.<br />I loved the play too, and there a few songs that aren't here from the play, but they weren't in the movie either!<br />It's probably a good idea to have both the original Broadway version of the soundtrack along with this if you have seen the play and miss the few missing songs.<br />GREASE IS THE WORD......
6300216047|4.0|You can't get much more bizarre than this sexed-up but super-silly saga of an intergalactic secret agent sent to a rebel planet to find a mad scientist named Duran Duran. The story is extremely flimsy and seems to have been created largely in order to showcase new and increasingly strange ways of stripping off most of Jane Fonda's clothes--and in this the film succeeds extremely well, beginning with Fonda's &quot;weightless&quot; striptease over the title credits and finally fetching up with Fonda disrobed by the evil Duran Duran's fiendish orgasmatron.  The costumes, sets, and special effets are swinging 60's at their most excessively fab; the cast is so relaxed that you may think they're performing under the influence.<br />No one in the cast takes this film seriously, and neither should you. BARBARELLA has all the intellectual depth of a pancake,  not so much flatly funny as merely amusing and appealing to a truly high-camp sensibility. As cult movies go, however, it rates very high--give a party and show it on a double bill with FLESH GORDON!
B00000099Y|5.0|If you don't have it, buy it. Stop thinking about it. Let it take over. This album, it is almost a religion. Not that Maynard would say that. Also, get Lateralus for when you are feeling a little moodier. This band is almost a symphony, with its infinite layers of sound. Also, their concerts are awe inspiring. Life Changing.
B00000IQC8|1.0|After hearing people talk about how great this low budget film was, I was expecting to see a good comedy about what its like to work in one of those mini marts and the oddballs that drop in at all hours.  Instead, I was totally bored and had no trouble keeping myself from even a chuckle.  The dialog between the characters was not particularly interesting---just mainly vulgar which bores me to death.  My wife left the room after a half hour of it as she felt it was too offensive.  I think I turned it off after 45 minutes. Recommendation:   Buy a good book instead and don't waste your time or money with this DVD.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|I bought the original double album Nuggets at a used record store around 1975 and it was always a favorite.  I was elated when Rhino put the music from the original album and added even more selections to this box set.  The fun part about this collection is the mixure of familiar tunes (like Incense and Peppermints by the Strawberry Alarm Clock or Nobody But Me by the Human Beinz) mixed in with some obscure tunes which are no less greater than the familiar ones but did not get much airplay. Included in this collection is &quot;Shape of Things to Come&quot; which was the theme from that campy film &quot;Wild In the Streets&quot; and &quot;Complication&quot; by The Monks.  Definitely a good value for those who enjoy music from this era.
B000050XEI|2.0|I was once a die=hard Enya fan, but no more. With this album she has proven herself to be stuck in a rut, albeit a very celestial, meditative one. After I heard this, I sold all my albums. Don't believe the garbage said about her album. <BR>    Again paired with husband/wife tag team Nicky and Roma Ryan, they produce a mellow wonder that makes Kenny G seem like Johnny Rotten, and turns Raffi into Duke Ellington. This is pure bubble gum misery that repeats itself. Even the lyrics, which were once shimmering with spirituality and wit, are childish and prating. Roma Ryan doesn't even use realistic Latin. (latin quid utiatur pro gratia creandi trivium eiciatur avibus-- loquor meliore latine) <BR>    A critic in a Pennsylvania paper said that this album is the year's guiltiest pleasure, for, in the wake of Sept. 11, &quot;her light fare is just the pick-me-up that so many of us needed&quot;. He couldn't be more wrong. The whole of the Brennan family ( which includes Moire Brennan and clannad) have all turned into a sugary meltdown with layers of synthesizers and rhyme-ridden, vague songs. IF Enya is to survive this travisty, she needs to step out of her castle in the clouds and give her music some pep. <BR>       This album will appeal to people who know nothing about her, but she has alienated herself from her older fans.
B00000ILE7|3.0|Story:<br />    On the way back to Earth from LV426 the Sulaco experiences a fire and the survivors from Aliens are dropped down to a prison planet in an escape pod.  The fire was cause by the spilt acid of a facehugger's blood although it is never explained how some alien eggs got aboard the ship in the first place, much less the cryo chamber where the crew was sleeping.<BR>    When the escape pod crashes near the shore of the prison Hicks is impailed by a support beam, Newt awakens only to drown in her chamber, Bishop is further damaged and Ripley survives (hey, she's the star).  The pod is rescued by some of the prison's inhabitants while they were outside working with oxen.  Ripley is found alive and is taken to the infirmary but no one notices that the facehugger has hitched along for the ride in the escape pod.  The facehugger quickly attacks an ox and lays an embryo within.<BR>     Ripley recovers and is curious to found out what happened.  As she figures out what occured another prisoner discovers a dead ox with its chest burst open and alongside the now dead facehugger (its huuuuge, bigger than the ones seen in previous films, its a different design which explains why the alien in this film looks somewhat different from, again, the ones in previous films).  Ripley tells everyone that there might be an alien around but of course no one believes her and the body count starts to rise.  After witnessing the alien the prisoners set a trap to entrap the alien by burning sections of the prison and luring it into a chamber.  Something of course goes wrong and many of the prisoners are killed in the fire but the plan works and the alien is finally trapped.  Unfortunately a psychotic prisoner frees the alien believing it is god and the body count continues.<BR>    Ripley discovers she's now carrying an alien inside of her and tries to kill herself by letting the alien kill her but of course the alien wont do that since it senses that she's carrying a queen!  The Company is also on its way to the planet to capture the queen for themselves so times running out.<BR>   After some more deaths the alien is finally killed but the Company gets there in time to capture Ripley and the queen.  Ripley not wanting the Company to capture the queen and use it as a weapon throws herself into a furnace and kills herself and the queen.<br />Movie :<br />    This movie was done to cash in on the sucess of Aliens, let me just make that clear.  The final script wasn't even complete until a few weeks before filming began (although by today's standards many directors would be thankful to at least have a few weeks!  Jurassic Park 3's script wasn't completed until the last week of shooting)!  Alien 3 was rushed into production.  This explains why the movie is nowhere near as good as Fincher's other films, Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, The Panic Room.  <BR>    During production the crew ran into a problem, oxen don't do anything!  The oxen wouldn't do what was called for in the script and at the last minute they replaced the ox and reshot using a dog!  Many people mistakenly believe that the reason the alien looks different is because it came out of a dog, this is not true since the dog wasn't added into the movie till the very last minute.<BR>    The editing process was also hurried and many of the scenes were left on the cutting room floor which makes the final movie feel rushed and chopped up.  In fact, if you ever get to watch the trailer for this movie you'll notice that 85% of it isn't in the movie!  Some scenes cut out were all the scenes with the oxen, scenes where the alien is first trapped and released, scenes with the huge facehugger and more scenes with a lot of character development.  If you look around you'll find pictures and avi's of some of these scenes on different websites.<br />The movie itself looks great and has great performances unfortunately it feels incomplete and badly edited and thats only because it is.  It would be nice if Fincher and Fox could reteam and complete this movie and release it as a Special Edition DVD.  Hey, write in folks and let them know that there is a demand to see this happen!
B000001AJG|5.0|This album is on the same classic scale as Miles Davis's classic jazz album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and should be revered as much. It should be gazed though the prism of a jazz influenced documentary about plants rather than through the prism of his(Stevies) funk and soul albums-which unfortunately is what the one reviewer mistermaxx must have done. The vocal ballads are some of his best from any album he's ever done and just like a good wine it seems to get even better as years go by and in my book that's worth the price of admission-Enjoy
B00003CY0V|3.0|Swordfish is good movie, but you have to pay attention to enjoy it.  As Travolta's character said in the movie, its all about misdirection, i.e. you only believe what you see and hear.<br />It's the classic story of a big bank heist only set in today's new cyber age where money is stolen with keyboard instead of guns.  John Travolta plays the role of the witty and vile bad guy, however he's too charming not to like.  In the movie, he recruits Hugh Jackman's character to help him in the heist from some secret government bank accounts.<br />Critics have based the movie but here's what makes it good.  Its thrilling because of all it's twists and turns, you won't know how the movie turns out until the end.  The ending is quite unexpected too.  Your never really sure whos using who during the movie either, which is why you have to pay attention or else you'll miss a key part and end up saying &quot;gee that was a dumb movie&quot;.<br />Once again, to steal a line, misdirection is the key to the movie.  You may even question if Travolta's character was really the bad guy or patriotic American after watching Swordfish.
6304578482|5.0|I have watched this movie about 50 times now, and my best friend and I pride ourselves on being able to recall all of the dialogue!  It is a must for Lisa Kudrow fans since her performance as Michele almost completely mirrors her role as Phoebe on the popular TV show Friends.  At age 29, I would have been a sophomore in high school when Romy and Michele graduated; the &quot;A&quot; group closely mirrored the &quot;Class Officers&quot; of my school - pretty cheer-leader types who nice to you when they wanted to be, but usually stuck-up and pretentious, hiding their own insecurities behind mall hair and too much foundation.<br />The secret to enjoying this movie is to watch Lisa Kudrow's facial expressions and hang on to her every word...&quot;God, this underwear is TOTALLY riding up my buttcrack&quot;.  If you don't enjoy Kudrow, then you will get hung up on the various small flaws the movie has (like the long dream sequence).  <br />I put this movie in the same category as Caddyshack, Meatballs, and National Lampoon's Vacation.
6304510861|4.0|A great mind of our time. Still partial to Blue Velet (and TP is the greatest thing to ever grace TV), but this is definitely a great DVD. Don't bother with VHS as the quality is horrible because the cinematography is so dark. One bit of advice is: rent the DVD and wait for the Widescreen edition to buy (let me know if someone knows about a Widesceen version, it disgusts me this is sold in Pan&amp;Scan - which I have).
B00005N9CV|4.0|Seems like there is a lot of Krall bashing here. And praises. Music is a matter of perception, and some albums seem to evict more controversy than others, and not always for the right reasons. Yes, there's a lot of marketing involved - but who isn't trying to make some money? Artists disappear overnight, so is it criminal to make the most of it whilst being in the limelight? <br />I see a lot of mention of big names - Peggy Lee is a favourite, amongst others. Every musician deserves a listen for his/her own talent (or lack of), and not just a comparison with anyone else you deem as similar. <br />Ms Krall is talented and possesses a very expressive voice - and I think whatever she does, she's going to sound better than most of the contemporary artists out there today. That's not to say each and every artist does not have some merit in their own right - it's just that some are harder to make out than others, and in Ms Krall's case, it's just not hard.<br />What I find hard to believe there's so much of negativity over someone obviously talented - just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it is not &quot;good&quot;. This album, whilst not being jazz as some people understand it to be, in its own right, is still pretty darn good. <br />Listen to it before you buy, if you're critical. If not, it still isn't going to be one of your poorer acquisitions. On the other hand, the &quot;limited edition&quot; marketing gimick ... that's a bit icky.

B000059PPX|1.0|Speaking as someone who was a mere twinkle in his father's eye in the 60s, I have no fond memories which this movie rekindles.  I presume it is supposed to be campy fun, but it's a pretty terrible movie from start to finish.  Big names, bad script, bad acting, bad music.  This movie has everything.
0345409671|4.0|I admit, when I first sat down to read this book, I didn't know what to expect; I had heard so many different opinions of it.<BR>And I will say one thing: this is not for someone just starting the Vampire Chronicles!  It is meant for the readers who have followed Lestat through his life, and feel a close connection with him.  <BR>While I personally feel betrayed by this book, I can't think of a better way Rice could have written it. <BR>Now, I don't feel betrayed because I disliked the book, rather, I feel betrayed for the lack of ending she gave us...what happens to Lestat???  I know that others, like myself, are eager for Rice to write more of our favorite Vampire.  <BR>I can't remember another book so deeply affecting me that I sat for hours just pondering what she wrote...and this book is by no means for readers who like fast-paced action!  It is for those who appreciate the more philosophical aspect to Rice's work, which has always been there, from the first pages of Interview With the Vampire.  Memnoch truly does tug at your heart with his sympathetic retelling of Creation and Christian lore.  I found myself, although already knowing the ending, wanting to believe in Memnoch, wanting his story to be true...or hoping maybe that he had been misinformed by God, that he had misunderstood...because I didn't want Memnoch to be a bad guy!<BR>Memnoch is a perfect reflection of our own dear Lestat.  Lestat admits to being evil, and we can't help but love him all the more for it, because we know that his heart isn't evil!  <BR>Personally, while reading this, I was reminded strongly of Lestat's journeys with Akasha during Queen of the Damned.  Lestat was being told by someone whom he loved, yet was also inherently evil, that they were good, and that they had a plan for goodness, if only Lestat would help them!<BR>A truly heart felt book, I think.  I wonder...did Anne cry when she finished it?  I would have...
0553277472|4.0|Being the beneficiary (??) of a Great Books liberal arts education, yes, the same one that Pirsig writes about at his time at U of Chicago, one would think I'd be very dissapointed in his work.  Not so.  Reading this brings to light many of the questions and concerns I've had over the years.  It's a shame I wasn't reading this at the time that I was in college, because I was searching along the same paths he was (although I wasn't involved with bikes at the time, more along the lines of dance parties and the occasional search/rescue mission).  <br /> For those that are entrenched in the classical science vs art dichotomy, Pirsig will shake you up some.  But at the same time, he does bring a big revelation to bear: there is Art within Science, and Science within Art.  And when we realize that we can indulge in both, we might be able to get back some of that pride in craftmanship that is so lacking in today's world.
0446608955|5.0|I found A walk to Remember to be one of the best books that I have ever read in my entire life. The writing was unique and worded just so that it added a touch of humor in all the right places. I read it in a couple of hours and when I was done, I wanted so badly for it to continue. I loved the way that the characters were introduced and explained in a way that made you feel a part of the small town. I have never been to North Carolina, but the discriptions and details were so thourough that I felt that I had actually grown up there too. I have been searching for a favorite author and I think that Nicholas Sparks has made my list and I can't wait to read the rest of his books that I'm sure are  &quot;marvelous!&quot; I can't even find the words to descibe how much I enjoyed this book. It definitly gives insight to the misunderstandings of young love. Being young myself, I hope that when I fall in love, it is with the same passion and life-altering powerfulness that this book represents. It is definitly the most romantic book that I have ever read...
B000002MTR|5.0|The majority of Chili's fans tend to overlook OHM, choosing to focus on the two big albums before and after it. However OHM can't be compared to those two because the Chili's are experimenting with a new direction, led by Navaro, and the result is an absolutely incredible album, full of strong music. The album isn't as commericial as the new one, therefore it didn't achieve the same success, but it is a masterpiece in it's own right, full of songs that are a lot more skillfull and thoughtful than the tracks on Californication. Only a shallow fool could possibly think this album wasn't as good as the others, I have no doubt that this alternative style (which is unique to this album) is actually the best sound the Chili's ever produced. They never should have let Navaro leave.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Great collection of #1 singles. Great sound quality and a must have if you want to start a music collection of this great group.
0375507507|5.0|What a pleasure it is to start off the new year with a wonderful new book.  I probably never would have picked this book up, except for the glowing reviews it's been getting.  And, are they ever deserved.  This is the story of Bobo Fuller, daughter of gone-to-the-dogs parents in 1970's Rhodesia, on the losing (depending on your point of view) side of a civil war.  Covering her growing-up years of moving from one place to another in Africa always searching for a way to exist in a place where white Africans no longer had power and privilege, Ms. Fuller writes unsparingly, unsentimentally, and honestly about her family and their remarkable experiences. Don't miss this terrific book.
B000003TAB|5.0|This is essential for any true Nirvana fan.  The songs range from pop-punk (Been a Son, Sliver), to hard rock (Dive, Anyeurysm), to all out grunge (Hair-Spray Queen, Big Long Now).  It's definately the most diverse Nirvana album.  This is a truly great album and anyone who doesn't like it (but sems to like Nevermind) is a poser!
B00005R87Q|5.0|Great movie!!! (excuse the cliches) Fun-filled, action-packed, and loaded with adrenaline.  I suppose you could call it a guy movie but I'm a girl and I'm not a tomboy and I thought it ROCKED!  It's about a cop who goes undercover as a street racer to find out who's been jumping semis and stealing their cargo... <BR>The cop becomes really good friends with Dom, the top street racer, and falls in love with Dom's sister, Mia... It's a great summer movie, shameless fun! I recommend it to anyone!!!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|Ignore anything negative that you may hear about this movie and simply put...just go see it! I have not been a Russell Crowe fan in the least, but after watching this performance I can truly say it was one of the best performances that I have ever seen. There were two aspects of this movie that made me think this movie should be considered for an Academy Award. First there was the portayal of John Nash by Russell Crowe and then there was the portrayal of a debilitating illness that touches many of us in one way or another. The cast does a bang up job, the music composed by James Horner was phenomenal, and the direction by Ron Howard surpassed even his Apollo 13 movie. I would be stunned if this movie does not walk away with multiple Academy Awards. A must see film, especially those touched by mental illness in any way. I do not think you will be disappointed.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie was never boring or slow, I'm not into street racing with all the fancy cars (but my husband is &amp; he's not a big movie goer as I am &amp; he loved it.)This movie made you feel like you we're pumped up with adrenalin it kept you on the edge of your seat! And Dominic (Vin Diesel) &amp; Paul Walker are very hot in this movie!!! I would recommened to buy this movie.

B00005ATQD|5.0|Well, Now I'm no professional but let's face it, the acting in this movie is no less then perfect.  This is in my opinion tom cruise's best movie(close call with rainman).  I could not turn this movie off due to the seriousness it took with everyone of its actors.  Kubrick is an absolute genius.  To this day I will never understand whats goin on in that costume store with the owner, the daughter(or whoever that was), and those oriental guys dressed in drag, but that was one of my favorite scenes in the enitire movie. In my opinion anyone could have played kidman's part, just as well, even though at the time she was &quot;the wife&quot;.  I will keep this short and sweet.  If you like Kubrick's dark, but beautiful work behind the camera and a soft spoken but very strong tom cruise, please check this flick out.  3 words to sum up my review.  Strange, Weird, Unbelievable.  Rent it, Buy it, Don't pass on it.
0689835604|5.0|This book is simply the best!  It has kept my daughter's rapt attention from two months on.  It can even stop her from being fussy.  The colors and details in the patterns of the pictures   seem to captivate her.  We read it over and over.  She never tires of it.  She is 6 months now and her friends, Bradley(15  months) and Jake(22) months keep trying to sneak a peek at it!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is by far, one of the best films I've seen in quite some time! I usually don't have the time to write a review, but for this film, I made the time. I saw the film , and afterwards logged on Amazon.com and bought it. <BR>If you liked &quot;The Green Mile&quot; you'll love this movie too.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I am life-long Pink Floyd but I have to say that Echoes is not a proper Pink Floyd greatest hits. It may have some of the biggest known singles such as Us and Them, Money, Wish You Were Here, etc.. But How the hell on earth do the songs such as Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage/Eclipse are missing.. That's baffle me. Also, The songs from Syd era are under represent. But the sequential of the songs is really killing me.. They don't flow smoothly from song to song. Hence, the concept of &quot;Concept Album&quot; is entirely missing.. And that's not Pink Floyd. If I were you guys. I'd rather go out and buy all those original Pink Floyd Albums..
B00005N9CV|5.0|[...]. For all of us wanna-be critics, let's please critique an album for what it is and not for what we wished it had been. Is this CD (tecnically, the last two)different from her work of 3-10 years ago? Was Sgt. Pepper's different from A Hard Day's Night? As fans with opinions, let's stop beating up artists for the changes they CHOOSE to undertake in their careers and stick to sharing our thoughts on the MUSIC. <br />In Ms. Krall's latest work on The Look of Love, she and her management team have chosen to record some more great classic songs emphasizing Diana's sensual, captivating voice more than her talents as a jazz pianist. On those merits, she has produced a myriad of cuts that once again are a testament to her unique addictive voice.<br />She has made the Gershwin's smile with her rendition of S'Wonderful, Mercer proud with her take on I Remember You, Hoagy pleased with her interpretation of his I Get Along Without You Very Well (I still like Chet Baker's early studio version and even his live version just prior to his death), and Bacharach is not surprised that his classic title cut, The Look of Love, is every bit the great song it was when he first penned it. Besame Mucho is an enchanting bossa nova-ish song that this Canadian does very well in Spanish. The others are well known classic songs that Diana has chosen to honor and show her appreciation for by recording them in her own style. This creates an opportunity for those who may have been unfamiliar with some of these classics to become familiar with them, and enjoy them, because they liked Diana's personal style first. That is simply good for music.<br />Those of you looking for a great, sultry, unique voice singing great songs, this CD fits the bill.For those of you who beat up an artist for expressing a different style than what you expected or prefer, please critique music for what it is and not for what you had hoped for or expected, style-wise.The reader can figure the rest out on their own.<br/>As a sidenote, I kinda like the dress. Great legs.<br />Can anyone out there tell me where I can get a recording of Krall's A Case Of You? Has she recorded it? I have heard her rendition twice in live concerts and am mesmerized at her rendition. [....]
0553801481|5.0|this is a phat book, it looks like it will live up to the farseer trilogy (which was my favorite series ever)
B000002C1V|5.0|Though it is clearly that the author of this masterpiece is the enormous Roger Waters, inspired on his own troublesome childhood and teenage, it is not less true that Gilmours brain were behind. If not, it would be impossible to admit later solo works like Radio Kaos coming from the same music talent only.<BR>The Final Cut would perhaps be considered as a saga of The Wall. I think it was conceived in that manner, but was clearly shifted towards anti-belicism after the South Atlantic War that the British Crown iniciated by mid-1982. There are several direct mentions to that in the lyrics, and it is a strongly dark meesage to those who rule their peoples destiny.<BR>Music performance is wonderful. Particularly the sax soloes, from which player, Raphael Ravenscroft,  we did not know anymore.<BR>The superb National Philharmonic Orchestra is the perfect companion to this arrange of rock musicians.<BR>Although not often mentioned in Pink Floyd discography -perhaps because it marked Waters departure- this album is a must to any PF fan.
0525946284|4.0|While his last several books were mediocre at best, Follett returns to classic form with Jackdaws. Though not as good as Eye Of The Needle or The Key To Rebecca, Jackdaws is Follett's best book in many years. The tension constantly builds and the action is non-stop. For pure suspense-reading, Jackdaws will have you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. However, Jackdaws falls short of deserving a 5-star rating from me because, with the exception of Flick and Dieter Franck, many of his characters served as &quot;tools&quot; to tell this action-packed WWII thriller and were not developed well enough to truly care (one way or the other) about. While I thought this criticism would be important for you to know, I would highly recommend Jackdaws if you're in the mood for a novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of WWII.

B000005IU1|5.0|This is THE CLASSIC PROTO-PUNK ALBUM! BAR NONE! Iggy is the best... a Mick Jagger without the charm or appeal. His vocals on this album rock major ass. Please, if you have any interest in real rock and roll, you must own this album. For the first time ever, someone showed the rock world that you could get by on testerone and amphetamines alone. The riffs are great. The guitars are crunchy, catchy and distorted. John Cale's little touches (the sleigh bells on \\"I wanna be your dog\\") are devine.
B00001SIES|5.0|I usually buy a CD for 1 or 2 songs that I like.  I am very picky.  The more I listen to the CD, the more my opinion changes...and I start to like some songs more and some songs less.<br />But Muse is totally different.  I just can't stop listening to this one CD.  It is the only CD I have ever found where I literally love every song.  It blows similar bands like Radiohead, The Pixies, Travis, etc...out of the water.<br />The beats are all so extremely unique, complex, and consuming.  The more you listen to it, the more you love it.  Every song ends up &quot;feeling&quot; like a classic song, and you think that everyone will recognioze the beat because it is just SO good.  But the fact is, NOBODY seems to know about them.<br />Everyone I have played this CD to has loved it.  And I am talking about techno/rap listeners, Beatles listeners, and hardcore rock listeners.  They are just GOOD.
B000002L9J|5.0|This album is perfect.<br />It is more accesible than any other Smiths album; at times it even seems to be a normal pop album. But, looks are deceiving. This is a deep album with the trademark subtle archness of Morissey.<br />Every song on here is a jewel of pop perfection. It would be deceptive of me to even single any one song out... they're all so good. Most importantly, it hangs together as an album of breath-taking scope.<br />Buy it already.
B00004WIBW|4.0|I really  enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp does a wonderful job, as always. Tim burton's genius and the music by Danny Elfman, [both of which did the nightmare before christmas movie], brings the story to life. the gore, i thought was preatty cool. And the plot line between the characters was creative, although sometimes confusing. I recommend this movie very much. And for those people who say that the french credits were the best part, you should get a life, because obviously you don't know a good movie, from a stupid one. Tim Burton is wonderful as are the characters, and, if I'm not mistaken, I don't see you making or acting in movies. Although, this is only my opinion.
B000002BBY|5.0|This is the best mainstream rock album of the 90's-- bar none.<BR>I don't normally listen to pop rock, I can't stand the stuff. I like punk music or garage rock. My second favorite rock album of the nineties is probably by Sleater-Kinney or Spiritualized. This album, however, is as good as any of the great rock and roll albums. It's as good as 'Exile on Main Street' or 'Revolver'.<br />Rock is two important elements: guitars and words. Both of those elements are ABSOLUTELY PERFECT ON THIS ALBUM. 'Wonderwall' is one of the best rock singles ever. The intro on acoustic guitar reminded me of why exactly I like rock music. <br />It's brilliant. It's effortless. It made me hate these guys-- why did such a moronic pair happen to have the greatest talent in contemporary music? I don't know. Anyway, I like this against all better judgement.
B000000OSW|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Put All the High Brow analysis aside and let the dream of the music take you. Its a definite buy for a great collection of music.
B000002VTE|5.0|I am absolutely flabbergasted that this has a rating of three and a half stars...<br />This is the sound of psychedelic music today. This is how it's done, and if you can't take it, you need loosen your collar. It's a wild ride.<br />This album operates on the pleasure principle. Listen to the title track: it's a masterpiece. Imagine floating in space with the one you love caressing you.<br />'Come together' hits you right in the breadbasket. It's got the South London choir on it for God's sake... and it's awesome. A mixture of psychedelic music and gospel.<br />'Electricity' is a psychedelic rocker of the utmost excellence.<br />Jeez, and 'Cop Shoot Cop'. It's like the great song that Can or the Velvet Underground or Pink Floyd never got around to... it'll blow your socks off.<br />This album is great. Trust me. If it didn't, I would tell you. It's great.
B000002GXS|4.0|Still singing in the bluesy-jazzy serenade that he abandoned by his next album, this is Tom Waits the Barstool Philosopher at his best. The instrumentation is mostly his jazzy piano with occasional backing from strings, and a cabaret rhythm section. Some of his best early songs are on here, including New Coat of Paint, San Diego Serande, the incredible title track, and the winning semi-spoken-word piece, Diamonds On My Windshield (seemingly a blueprint for many of his later songs.) He never quite returned to songs of this particular type again (certainly not with this voice), and it is good to go back and see that he wrote great songs of this type. Moving away from the ballads and &quot;midnight lullabies&quot; on his first album, this collection houses a very poignant set of lyrics that set the scenes omnipresent on his first album (indeed, on all of them up to Swordfishtrombones) to poetry. There are quite a few good lines on this album, and his vocals are some of his most affecting. Although it's not as interesting or sprawling as some of his later, better albums, The Heart of Saturday Night is nonetheless a fine Tom Waits album, and is very good at what it does. Any fan will want to pick it up, and it truly is a soundtrack for when you are looking for the heart of Saturday night.
B000009RC2|4.0|I'm primarily a rock and roll fan-- although I do listen to a lot of classic jazz. This is a masterful album, the playing is clear, well-concieved and well-executed. At times, though, it seems to run out of steam.<br />A fusion band has a hard time ahead of it. Fusion lacks the simple, groovy... pop-rock. It also usually lacks the sort of distant, sophisticated cool of jazz. Because of this, the music often lacks soul despite the guitar pyrotechnics. Most of the time, I wasn't aware of what emotion the music was trying to bring across. I was moved-- just not always emotionally.<br />I feel that this album often overcomes many of the problems of fusion. However, it is still pompous and a bit dull at times.
B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles' first album is not their best. However, for beginners, they sound great. With eight originals and six covers (which was common in the sixties), all of them stand out. I Saw Her Standing There is a good, rocking song to dance to. There are soft songs, like Misery and Anna. It also contains the classic Twist And Shout, originally by The Isley Brothers. Other good songs include Chains and Do You Want To Know A Secret (both sung by George). If you are a Beatles collector, you should get this because if you like the later stuff, like Sgt. Pepper and the White Album, then you should get used to this first, so you'll get into the flow of what you'll hear later on.
B00004Z459|4.0|I was a little put off when I first saw &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the TV: oh no, another rap-metal band. Thankfully, my brother has the CD and I quickly attained my own copy of it. I was surprised by the relative bredth of the songs: this was more trip-hop metal than the usual Limp Bizkit-style garbage. These guys can actually rap, they have some trippy instrumental passages and standout, introspective lyrics. Takes some time to appreciate, but once you get into it, you won't regret getting it. Great CD.
1558908846|4.0|Judge Dredd is an actoin movie. Period. It's great brainless fun if you just want to see a bunch of grungy future guys shooting guns and blowing stuff up. If you want a thinking action movie, get Ronin or the French Connection.<br />Visually, I thought this was one of the best comic book adaptations ever, up on the level as the original 1989 Batman. The unique armor and city style of the U.K. Judge Dredd series definitely shines through true to the comics. If this movie had sound effects written into the screen, it would easily come across as watching a comic. Beautiful.<br />All in all, this movie is wonderfully bad. Cheesy lines, Stallone playing a role perfectly suited for him, lots of violence. Perfect movie for a night where you just want to let your brain rest with a bad action movie.
B00005K9LK|5.0|My all time favorite Judas Priest album, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" was without a doubt a classic.  Though it was Judas Priest's last great record, it is one of their finest.  \\"The Hellion\\", \\"Electric Eye\\", \\"... Child\\", the title track, and the classic \\"You Got Another Thing Coming\\" are standout cuts, and this album deserves a place in any real metalhead's collection.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Well this DVD is very good and the ending is much better than the ending in the orignel. why there are 3 reasons why the first is the director Sam Rami him self liked this ending more than in the orignel so you are geting it the way he wanted you to see it. The second reason is the humor in that seen is way better all he wants to do is get home and things keep perventing him from geting there and thats what makes it so funny. We don't know if he is ever going to get back home and the thrid is everybody is mad because the hail to the king line is not in the movie thats a stupid reason its one line one line dose not make a movie but to some people I guess it dose but this ending is way better and anyone who has not seen the bootleg DVD should see it. I was very suprized at the reviews for this bootleg edition they are all mad about the end but the ending in this one is better than the other. So it makes no sense to me even the director himself likes this seen more and he made the trilogy so this is a great movie even better with the bootleg cut and the better ending. Watch it and think about it this ending is great.
B00000JMQE|5.0|1939. The Wizard of Oz musical movie sensation starring Judy Garland makes history. The timing was right. The U.S. and the whole world was entering WWII. We needed to laugh again, to fall in love with a timeless innocence, as is depicted with Judy Garland's performance, the Munchkin and the Romantic scope of the film. There is no doubt that The Wizard of Oz is a classic. However, L. Frank Baum wrote an extensive series, following the Wizard of Oz, in which Dorothy returns to Oz and has further exploits. Return To Oz, starring Faureza Balk as Dorothy, is more or less faithful to some of the characters and darker aspects of Baum's Oz novels. In the novels, the evil Gnome King, a bearded greedy little creature similar to the character of Alberich in the Nibelung saga, has seized power and taken over Oz, casting it into darkness and ruins. The only hope lies in the liberation of Ozma, the beautiful and benevolent enchantress who has been trapped in a mirror. Mombi, a truly wicked spectre, is a princess with a fetish for putting on human heads as easily as wigs. These Gothic images, the haunting milieu of the film, are perfectly captured. The novels had dark moments, such as the broken Yellow Brick Road, the ruined Emerald City and darkened skies, Mombi's henchmen, all perfectly made into Muppets and Tim Burton-like creations. Faureza Balk, in the end, is a more believable Dorothy. Judy Garland was too old to play a little girl. In the Baum novels, Dorothy was only a prepubescent child. Perhaps the success of the 1939 film lay in the charm of Judy Garland's voice, &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot; became the no. 1 song of the 20th century, and in the fact that America did not want to see the spoils and ravages of war. However, as all good fantasies, and Baum's is no exception, the land of Oz is saved once again from evil by Dorothy and her friends. This is a terrific film, with dazzling special effects, haunting and beautiful music (which is similar to the same Gothic Romantic sounds of Danny Elfman who wrote music for Edward ScissorHands) and wonderful, believable performances by Faureza Balk and Jean Marsh as Mombi. Before you see Return to Oz, however, you'd best read the novels. They will help explain the drastic transition from the 1939 Oz we all love and remember to the 1985 Oz. Enjoy.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This movie is a great movie, showing another side of Russell Crowe's acting. From his prier movie Gladiator, (which to me was also a 5 star movie)Beautiful Mind is a must see movie! If I could I would give it 6 stars!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Great from start to finish. A great film. Don't look to much into it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00005OM4K|5.0|I once owned all of the original issues of CCR CDs from the late eighties.<br />They have passable sound quality.  But this Box Set is Creedence Done Right. The Guitar notes at the end of \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\"<br />are so clear and lifelike you can not only hear the harmonics in them but you can taste them as well.  \\"Up Around The Bend\\" jumps out of the speakers with renewed vigor.<br /><br />The same is true for the rest of the set.  Live In Europe sounded a little fuzzy and on CD. Not a complete tragedy just a little muted.  Here it sounds fresh and spirited.<br />It also includes two songs (Door To Door & Sweet Hitch-Hiker) that were left off of the original CD.<br /><br />For the true CCR fan this is a must have.  It is a well deserved, and well done digital overhaul of the songs of a classic band.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I love this movie. Buy it now. Do not listen to the film snobs.
1881273156|5.0|With communication being the number one factor in making relationship work, this is a must read for both spouses. Chapman hits the \\"nail on the head\\" as he uncovers the five languages of love: Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch<br />Chapman clearly explains each language in a five chapters. Along the way, he includes experiences from real-life couples.   After uncovering each language, Chapman uses the next couple of chapters to help the reader discover his or her own love language as well as the spouse's.<br />Whether you are newlyweds or have been married for years, this book is highly recommended above any other book on marriage.  More than likely, a reader will discover they have misunderstood a mate because they were using the wrong language!  I'm seeing my mate in completely different light now. :)<br />--- reviewed by Ty for Christian Bookshelf
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I love this movie. Angelina is the perfect Lara Croft. The direction is somewhat lackluster but when it picks up you better look out. Noteable standout scenes include The opening shootout and the invasion of Croft Manor. Great film.
0441008356|4.0|For anyone who gets bored by 'hard' SF, this novel has a lot more going for it, well-described cultures and technologies, action on a grand scale, a backstory which will leave you amazed and a even couple of half-decent female characters. While I felt it flagged a bit at times, for a first novel it's a fantastic piece of work and I hope Alistair Reynolds goes on to even better things - he could be the new Iain Banks.
B000002BE9|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  Fiona's voice gives a mysterious yet whimsical twist to the music.  It's criminal yet innocent.  I like it I like it a lot.
B00005UKE0|5.0|This epic work takes on an entire new meaning with George Harrison's recent passing. From the plaintive, beautiful opening notes of &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot;,to the emotional outpouring of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; (which I listened to the day of his death and cried my eyes out for several hours) and &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, this towering masterwork has never sounded so vibrant. There really isn't much new I can say about George's first,post-Beatles tour-de-force except we the happy listener are richly rewarded for our patience and an open mind, these beautiful melodies, gorgeous acoustic arrangements and the soulful sound of Harrison's voice make for heavenly listening.<br />Rest In Peace George, you are sorely missed.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This movie has very flashy cars and Many sexy scenes, but beyond that there is no substance to the film. The story isn't very good (I was very board with the film) and the acting is terrible. In short this is not an oscar film. <br />Yet in a way the film is a perfect mirror reflection of the rotting of our culture. Remember the words of both tolkien and Zeppelin &quot;All that is gold does not glitter&quot;.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This DVD is jam packed with adrenaline and speed that not even Nos can compete.  There is great incite on how the film was made and how the subculture that it tried to emulate was used to bring this film to life.  The multi-angles that were shown from diffrent perspectives to certain stunts I think were the best I've ever seen in a film.  The actors and director's comments about making the film are PRICELESS(especially Vin Diesel's).  A great gift for any Vin Diesel Fan!!!  A DEFINITE MUST BUY!!!!!
B000003BF1|5.0|This is one of my favorie albums. \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" is a real rocker. I can't get that song out of my head. \\"Live with me\\" is also a good song.Buy it!!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|The best movie i've ever seen.  I saw it with my mom and at the end of the movie, I, all teary eyed, gave her a hug.  Its all about wanting to be loved.  That's all David wanted from Monica, and because he was not organic, that love was not true.  This movie tells the story of the first robot programmed to love humans, but do the humans owe him love back?<br />If you think about it, we are all robots.  Robots have circuitry and power and all that stuff.  Humans have vessels, our brain is like a computer, our heart is our power source.  Just because we are not made of metal, doesn't that make us robots of some sort?  Does that make sense?  Think about it...<br />People, see this movie.  I would rent it though because I know some of you will cherish this movie and some of you will despise it.  It all depends on what kind of person you are.  Mature people will like it, immature people will not.  Plainly said.  (pack lots of tissue)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At the Theatre, within the 1st 10 minutes, I thought, &quot;this is MTV, I'm ouuta Here.&quot; But instead, somehow I just sort of &quot;went into Baz's world of the Moulin Rouge&quot;. At some undetermined point, I found that the songs of Nirvana, Paul McCartney &amp; Wings, Elton John, took me back to the Grand Musicals of the 40's, and 50's that I saw as a kid of the sixties, but this had all of the advantages of C.G.! In an unbelievable, and overwhelming assualt of the senses and emotions, I downright WANTED to be there.  Nicole Kidman, who LEARNED how to be a &quot;showgirl&quot; to play her Role of Satine, the &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot; Star of the overwhelming sights, sounds and events at the Moulin Rouge, has been photgraphed in the style of the Greats. She pulls it off without a hitch. Her talents seem endless. If middle America thinks of her as &quot;the ex Mrs. Cruise&quot;, they are just plain missing out on one of the best actresses of our time. Ewan McGregor was wide eyed innocence personified, the Love-Struck dreamer that never once needed a &quot;Light Sabre&quot; (Phantom Menace) or a &quot;Tattoo&quot; (Pillow book) or &quot;Glam Hair&quot; (Velvet Goldmine). The actor is a chameleon, and should be bound for Superstardom. Together they, well, ROCKED. So then did the DVD... Spent 4 hours at the computer on December 18th, when I had soooo much else I really needed to do, just &quot;playing&quot; with Disc 2, and all it state of the art features. <BR>This odd, strange, sad, yet remarkable Motion Picture (it's too different to merely call it a Movie), has made it into my top ten. Possibly five. Wow. That's really something. I'm 39 years old, and have been in and around the business for a long time. Hats off, Baz... oh wait... you DID that in the Picture! Although, on the small screen, you may need to scan back to see the hats fly. It's so cool, it's worth it.
6305972591|3.0|This movie is extremely cheesy, but who cares it was entertaining.  A classic horror film.  It is very suspensful.  Not that good acting though by the actor who plays Isac.  The movie starts off very exciting.  This is a good movie to watch with some friends and just chill.
0767836286|5.0|A movie like Arlington Road would probably not be made today, given the impression of sensitivity to the events of September 11 that Hollywood would like to give.  That's a pity, because many of the points made by the movie are important and timely issues worth consideration.  As one of the characters, Professor Michael Faraday (portrayed by Jeff Bridges), is a college professor teaching a course on American Terrorism, the scriptwriters have the opportunity to delve into these issues in as much detail as any Hollywood movie ever could.  Issues of personal safety, of terrorist's motivation, and of government misconduct are discussed with some sophistication; few answers are provided and even the terrorists themselves are revealed as people in search of safety.  This is not to say that Arlington Road is sympathetic to mass murderers; but it shows us the complexities of the issues.  Ultimately the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad; but that's not known to the world at large.<br />The acting is exceptional.  Tim Robbins has long been one of my favorite actors.  I've especially appreciated his concern for the quality of the scripts he chooses and I've managed to forgive him for Mission to Mars.  Here he is at his finest, never overacting but conveying extremes from geniality to ferocity, and his understated malice is comparable to none.  Jeff Bridges makes an excellent choice as his foil.  I've tended to underrate Bridges as an actor--he certainly hasn't exercised the judgement of Robbins where scripts are concerned--but with movies such as The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Vanishing, and the Fischer King he's proven his worth.  Here he does indulge a bit in overacting, but for the most part is very convincing.<br />Director Mark Pellington deserves much of the film's credit, beyond that of the acting and script.  Camerawork is terrific, and the whole is suffused with a sense of style and a personal vision that points the movie to its stunning conclusion.  That neither Bridges nor Robbins are Superstar Icons with Tom Cruise-like looks or Schwarzenegger-esque muscles makes the film all the more believable.<br />Finally, the music by Angelo Badalamenti (of Twin Peaks fame) perfectly assists in creating the dramatic sense.  It is not so strange as the Twin Peaks music, but nonetheless subtle and quite sophisticated, refraining from the musical equivalent of overacting.ither Bridges nor Robbins are Superstar Icons with Tom Cruise-like looks or Schwarzenegger-esque muscles makes the film all the more believable.<br />Finally, the music by Angelo Badalamenti (of Twin Peaks fame) perfectly assists in creating the dramatic sense.

6301697707|5.0|What TREMORS is to me is a superb equivalent to 1981's AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. Both are sharply written monster flicks, superbly written with plenty of shocks, surprises and tongue-in-cheek humor. The only difference is the rather graituitious use of graphic violence and gore in AWIL, while TREMORS is remarkably restrained on the violence.<br />Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are perfectly cast as two independent cusses who work in a small town in Nevada. When they hear of rather gruesome demises of three people nearby, they freak and try to get out of it, but the unknown foe has blocked the road with a huge boulder. Meanwhile, odd seismograph readings are showing lots of seismic activity to a visiting student.<br />The two return to town, where the foe has turned out to be four oversized worms with a voracious appetite for people who can feel the vibrations of the people above ground and snatch them up. The result is scary, suspenseful, and downright funny, including an episode with a trigger-happy couple (Michael Gross, Reba MacEntire &quot;Reba&quot;) who refuse to retreat from the hungry worms, now termed &quot;Graboids.&quot;<br />If you're looking for a hardcore sex-and-slash-'em-up gore flick, this is not for you. If you're looking for entertaining horror flicks with light violence and profanity, then this is definitely for you, but don't get the two sequels. They're campier as they can get.<br />Rated PG-13 for profanity and light violence.
0553062182|4.0|The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You by Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D. Highly recommended.There is no end to the ways in which human personality types can be categorised. According to Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D., one of these categories, comprising about 15&#8211;20 percent of humanity, is the \\"highly sensitive person.\\" HSPs are individuals whose threshold for overarousal, physical or emotional, is lower than that of non-HSPs, although it falls along a scale. HSPs may be labeled \\"shy\\" or \\"avoidant\\" in school or society, when in fact they are really just trying to avoid the stress of overarousal. Aron is quick to point out that, while most HSPs are introverts, many are indeed extroverts. HSPs do not necessarily have better hearing, sense of smell, vision, etc., but their brains seem to process such incoming information at a different level. To a non-HSP, a rock concert or a casino is a loud, fun, exciting place to be. For an HSP, it is a loud, overwhelming, exhausting one that may require hours of aloneness and quiet to overcome the overarousal. According to Aron, the concept of the HSP is not mere psychobabble, but based on both psychological and physiological studies.<br />In American culture, and indeed in most Western cultures, HSP traits are generally seen as negative (hence, words like \\"shy,\\" \\"withdrawn,\\" \\"avoidant,\\" \\"inhibited\\"). Aron notes, however, that, in some cultures, HSPs are highly respected&#8212;in China, for example. HSP traits are neither bad nor good, but they have their positive and negative elements. While non-HSPs are warrior-kings, quick to make decisions and necessary to lead and act when such decisiveness and action are essential, HSPs are the the priests-judges-advisers, the more thoughtful group that \\"often act[s] to check the impulses of the warrior-kings.\\" Both clearly have an important role.<br />The Highly Sensitive Person defines the traits (with a self-assessment); asks you to accept yourself and your traits (or your HSP friends and theirs if you are a non-HSP); discusses childhood and provides guidelines for reframing experiences now that you understand your trait; and talks about such things as health, lifestyle, social relationships, work, love and sex, medicine and medication, and spirituality, with advice on how to avoid overarousal, especially unhealthy (physically and emotionally) long-term overarousal. The message is that HSPs are valuable and have a great deal to contribute to a non-HSP world that doesn't understand us, doesn't always value us, and sometimes is downright hostile toward us (\\"scaredy-cat\\" is something more than one HSP child has heard).<br />The Highly Sensitive Person is an attempt to help us understand what we need to do to find our optimal level of arousal (which is unique to the individual); manage unhealthy overarousal; and educate our family, friends, lovers, employers, teachers, physicians, etc., about our trait. It is also designed to assist non-HSPs understand their HSP friends and acquaintances. To me, it explained a lot about myself that I didn't realise I share with others (a heightened sensitivity to loud or repetitive noises that don't bother others, for example, and a tendency to find social events draining). There are no doubt some who would dismiss this all as self-help psychobabble&#8212;but for the HSP, this is invaluable self-help psychobabble. Highly recommended.

B00003XB8K|5.0|Because I wanted to maintain as much of my personal opinion and objective first impression as I could. Dealing with music this spiritual and sensual, it's important, I think, to see the music as you see it instead of possibly having your opinions altered and/or lost when you see what others have to say. After all, the big line in this CD itself is: Silence must be heard!<br />As for the music, if you're an enigma fan like me, it's top quality. Same quality of sound and production as Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Let Roi! (Enigma 3) but it has less messages. It's a bit more ambiguous. Perhaps that is why people only give this CD 4 out of 5 stars. The tracks make good background music, but in terms of the captivating voices that soar through every point, curve, and extreme of your body, there really isn't any of that to be found here.<br />But I still advocate buying this music because of its messages. During the 1990's Michael Cretu has been endlessly and endlessly harassed by lawsuits and the public. People reacted to his use of Marquis de Sade as a vector to introduce ideas of what is pure and what is not, or what is diabolical (of the devil) or divine. Prince and Madonna were compared to early Enigma works. But what Cretu said defined his work from those two artists were that he was not trying to prove a point. He merely started a journey, rather we all started a journey, to discover and figure out the enigma, that is what lies within ourselves. Sorry if this sounds a little deep but I couldn't really figure out a different way to phrase it. He also said that while they focused on sexuality he focused on sensuality, and there's a HUGE difference between the two. Ever wonder why movie ratings have sexuality and sensuality as two different descriptions? That question right there is an enigma, one which you may find an answer to on this CD! As for lawsuits, there were plenty, including the (in) famous one for the use of samples taken from the &quot;Jubilant Drinking Song&quot;, which they merely didn't include in the credits. Perhaps a 7-word sentence FRAGMENT listed under the credits could've prevented the whole stupid fiasco. Virgin Interactive lost a lot of money from that.<br />One way to look at what Cretu does with this disc is seeing how he rebels against those who've criticized his work over the past 12 years (since 1990). He gives this message: &quot;Basic instincts, social life - Paradoxes side by side. Don't submit to stupid rules - Be yourself and not a fool. Don't accept average habits - Open your heart and push the limits.&quot; For Cretu, this is a VERY harsh statement and I think it's great that he is saying this. It shows that his music is maturing. At its core, it's saying &quot;Take that you lousy bastards!&quot;, 'that' referring to whomever it may be.<br />The other cool phenom in this disc is the concept of the &quot;gravity of love&quot;. How love is very grounding. When things are out of order and we are floating way up high, out of control, love brings us back down to the heart and warmth of the earth (and passion and lust too!!). He says: &quot;Try to think about it ... - That's the chance to live your life and discover - What it is, what's the gravity of love - Look around just people, can you hear their voice - Find the one who'll gude you to the limits of your choice - But if you're in the eye of storm -Just think of the lonely dove - The experience of survival is key - To the gravity of love.

B000002URV|4.0|Because of the recording's quality. In fact, inside the fold-out pamphlet (that makes up the cover of the CD case) gives a slightly obnoxious warning:<br />&quot;The music on this Compact Disc was originally recorded on analog equipment. We have attempted to preserve, as closely as possible, the sound of the original recording. Because of its high resolution, however, the Compact Disc can reveal limitations of the source tape.&quot;<br />In case you don't know exactly what this means, I give you this picture. Imagine a classical music CD. Now suppose there are instruments recorded live like guitars, violins, and pianos, where intonation and quality of sound are a large part of the skill involved in playing. If you copy the sound coming from the instruments EXACTLY it will most likely sound pretty terrible because you can hear a lot of the hissing in the background. The problem with MCMXC A.D. is that the music is computer generated and mixed. It's supposed to be pure, 100%. So that if you turn up the volume higher and higher you only have to worry about making sure that the speakers or headphones you're using reproduce the correct sound, and not the CD. Honestly, compared to Enigma 2, 3, and 4, the sound quality in this is distracting at loud volumes. At low volumes though, the hissing is pretty much a non-factor.<br />And.. if you are merely interested in the sound of &quot;enigma&quot;, then I would recommend you shy away from this CD and get the excellently produced singles of Sadeness Part 1 and Mea Culpa instead.<br />Overall, I was disappointed, not in the quality of Curly M.C.'s music but in the &quot;digitizing&quot; of it, or whatever it was they tried to do to it. The opening of the CD invites you close your eyes, breathe meditatively, and move slowly, but when you hear fuzziness in the background whenever you turn up the volume, you are immediately pulled out of the trance just as quickly as you were pulled in. It is very irritating! Buy this CD if you want a complete collection or if you are interested in the other tracks, which weren't that popular on the radio: &quot;Find Love&quot;, &quot;Sadeness (reprise)&quot;, &quot;Callas Went Away&quot;, &quot;The Voice &amp; the Snake&quot;, &quot;Knocking on Forbidden Doors&quot;, &quot;Way to Eternity&quot;, and &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.<br />Fuzziness be damned. =O
B000002U6E|4.0|Lots, and I do mean LOTS of finger pointing in this one. Here's a few:<br />1. The eyes of truth are watching you, so make sure you make things count.<BR>2. White men came to America and blasted the natives to bits with big rifles.<BR>3. More white men coming and destroying stuff.<br />You get the idea. However, these three things were only my first impression. I know I'll begin to see more of the music as I open up to it, but I am saying this simply to warn you--don't take the music at face value. If you don't think you'll ever accept the three things listed above in some form (perhaps in a much more subtle way than how I have put it) then at least listen to Dream of the Dolphin. That song is so beautiful and if you don't like it, well... then... I don't care, it's beautiful!<br />Don't take my 4-star rating literally either. You'd be surprised at what you may find if you do or don't get this CD. Music is an expression of a person, and you cannot reduce a person to a number between 1 and 5. Likewise you cannot reduce music to a number between 1 and 5.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|An excellent film. The animation is amazing.  Whilst using all of the well known fairytale characters this is definately not a film just for kids, and appeals to all ages.  All of the actors chosen to feature as the various voices were well picked, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) was my favourate, and was exceptionally funny.<BR>The Extra's on the DVD were good and how the film was put together.  Overall this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year (2001)
B00004Z459|5.0|This is such a great band! Their songs relate so much to everyday life. They're are a sincere, real and true band! And this CD proves their talent! The songs go form hard-core rock to rap to soft rock. It is truly amazing. The lyrics are clean and meaningful not trashy like other hard rock bands. Me personally after a long hard day to a great and happy day I love to just sit down and listen to this CD. It is that good and I recommend this CD to a person , any person! No one in particular. My favorites include &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot; but all the songs are worth listening to.
6304708521|5.0|In 1967 or '68, Paul McCartney said that someday we will watch music as well as listen to it.  What vision.  The Beatles' videos in their prime.
B00005QATY|5.0|When the Ku Klux Klan was marching at their ceremony, did anyone get a hit of the Wizard of Oz? I swear, I kept waiting to hear &quot;OH HE HO, YO-HO.&quot; It seemed just like that scene in front of the wicked witch's castle, where the guardsmen are marching around, and then march into the castle, where the good guys sneak in, to rescue Dorothy. Only here, they're rescuing Tommy Johnson. <br />Anyway, it is no way lessened my enjoyment of this movie. I find these guys to be incredibly clever and rather sweet-natured with their products. Plenty of laughs at the foibles of humans, but not ill-natured ones. Besides, I'd pay good money just to watch that one scene of John Turturro dancing onstage while they sing &quot;He's in the Jailhouse Now.&quot; Absolutely classic!
B000002BUY|5.0|Adventurous is probably the best one word description to give this album.  Straight up heavy riffing one track, smooth jazz riffs the next.  Amid all this musical chameleaon act, the album still holds together extremely well.  Incubus goes from the hard rock of Favorite Things to the jazzy lounge music-like Summer Romance to Nebula, which is just insanity at its finest!  And that's what makes this CD so great - you get a little bit of everything.  The band's energy remains high throughout, and it really shows.  Take a listen, you won't regret it.
6305137293|4.0|I liked this second entry into the Halloween saga moreso than I liked the original but not as much as I enjoyed the fourth movie, which will ALWAYS be my favorite chapter of the ongoing Halloween storyline.<br />What I liked most about this movie is how fresh it feels.  The locale and the new characters that it provides keeps this sequel from looking just like any ol' horror movie.  Of course, the usual suspects are here as well.  Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance is back as Dr. Sam Loomis.<br />One warning, though... this movie picks up right where the first Halloween leaves off (immediately following the final scene, to be exact!) so it kinda helps if you see that movie first.
B000002LQR|5.0|Ahhh, another one of my so called desert island CDs.  Over 70 minutes of ebullient and incredible music.  There isn't one song on this album that I would skip over.  Every one is unique and so perfectly written.  This album covers a lot of territory.  Funk, metal, jazz, hip hop, blues - it's all there.  John Frusciante's playing is my personal favorite from this CD.  Wickedly down and dirty funk stylings make almost every guitar line fun to listen too.  But then at appropriate moments, this CD holds back and you get the mellow tunes like I Could Have Lied and Breaking the Girl. ...    ...
1558216847|5.0|An excellent story; I could not put it down.  I read a large excerpt from the original (1956) publication of this story a while back, and this new reprinting is great - with interesting new information from the author (who is still alive and answers his mail).<br />I, too, was skeptical about the crossing of the Gobi with such little water, but I've since learned (through a group of others on the web who are working to prove the validity of this story) that there were certain things omitted from this story.  One of the most significant was the fact that they apparently used their jackets to collect rainwater from the few storms that happened their way while crossing.  Why such an important detail would be omitted is beyond me, but that added piece of info. certainly makes it seem more plausible.<br />A group of us devoted readers of this story are doing research to try to validate the story, and some interesting facts have been uncovered thus far.  Those who are interested in learning more and joining the endeavor can search yahoo groups for The Long Walk (or TLW 1941).  There are a lot of other people who were as moved by this story as I was, and are now working to prove out its reality and perhaps uncover the final missing pieces in the story.<br />Again, an excellent book, and I give this new version two thumbs up.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is it.  THE AIC album.  I love all their other albums, but this is the definitive one.  I still remember the first time I put it on and Them Bones starting blaring from my stereo.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Such melody soaring over brutally yet seductively heavy music.  Every aspect of this CD is top qualitly.  Excellent production, great songwriting, and the vocal harmonies - oh the vocal harmonies.  Layne sounds his best on this CD.  Jerry's playing is also astounding.  Some of the solos are so crazy.  The Angry Chair solo just seems like a bunch of random notes, but it works.  But anyway go buy this album.  If you want to hear the band that every Godsmack and Drowning Pool is trying to imitate to no success, AIC is where to look.
6305609705|3.0|It sounds so cliche', but the reviewers who say the extra scenes in Redux simply should have been &quot;left on the cutting room floor&quot; are dead RIGHT.<br />I'm as big a fan as anybody of the movie, Apocalypse Now. I too feel its one of Coppola's three masterpieces (including Godfather 1 and 2), which are among the greatest films of all time. It was also rewarding to finally see the extra footage which I've heard about for so long - the Bunny scene, the Plantation scene, etc., - which never surfaced in the original release.<br />Having said that, however, the extra scenes add NOTHING to the movie and Redux is a noticibly inferior product to the original release version of Apocalypse Now. Not only does this extra footage add nothing to Now - it in fact, detracts from the film.<br />The extra scenes are confusing, the situations unbelievable and over-the-top, distracting and even BORING. They raise inconsistencies in the characters. The flow of the movie is totally disrupted. In short, I was like &quot;Huh? That wouldn't happen. That doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't really do that.&quot;<br />Contrary to some of these reviews, the original made perfect sense. These scenes add nothing to the understanding of the film, but to the contrary, they begin to undermine your belief in the story and the characters. Sometimes, less IS more. This is a prime example.<br />These scenes should be included in a DVD package - but as &quot;bonus footage&quot; as a special feature. They should not be inserted in the movie.<br />Finally, I'd also like to add, it would be mistaken to consider the Redux a &quot;Director's Cut.&quot;  Coppola had complete control over the project when the movie was originally released - going so far as to put up a lion's share of the funding out of his own pocket; with so much at stake, perhaps a reason he suffered a nervous breakdown making this picture.  <br />When Apocalypse Now was released, Coppola was at the peak of his craft - why shouldn't we trust his instincts then?  The answer is, we should.  Coppola makes great wine now, but his pictures are horrible.<br />This is definitely, definitely a renter - for the curious.  If you must own this movie, purchase the original.
B00000272N|5.0|I bought this CD 7 years ago when I was 14 and just learning how to play guitar.  I actually saw the Man in the Box video on Mtv and was totally blown away.  I had no clue music like that was out there.  Needless to say, I was in total love with Facelift for months.  Everyday it was in the CD player.  Not quite the case now.  It's probably my least favorite AIC album, but that's just because all the others are so amazingly good.  Layne and Jerry sound great together, and the music was so heavy for that time.  So maybe my review is just a little biased.  This is the first &quot;amazing&quot; CD I ever bought, and it inspired me to play guitar.  But if you're looking for classic &quot;ol' school&quot; AIC, Facelift is where it's at.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  When was the last time you've seen a horror movie that actually kept your interest.  The monster was impressive and effective.  Also, the characters played the part to keep the story rolling.  In horror movies you have to have a person that does something so stupid that the monster comes after them or else there wouldnt be any point to it.  I just dont understand you so called &quot;horror experts&quot; you expect every movie to be halloween or the exorcist.  Wake up, if you want to see those movies then watch them and dont look for them in every other horror movie.  I mean, just take a look at the latest winners that have come out lately, what other movies are as scary as this one?  Let me guess, SCREAM was the best horror movie you've all seen in years right?  Give me a break, all of these teen horror flicks are a waste of film and time and if you all cant see past them to a truly innovative movie like JEEPERS CREEPERS then buy halloween and the exorcist and watch till your hearts content.
6301697707|5.0|This movie is a kick in the butt, a throw-back to the old drive-in theater monster movies that where harmless fun. Bacon and Ward have great chemistry working and the rest of the cast <BR>supports them well, Including an out of character role for Michael Gross. this movie also lays claim to one of my favorite <BR>movie lines, &quot;Have you ever heard of these things?&quot; &quot;Oh yea, everybody knows about them, We just didn't tell you. Watch this movie, you'll like it.
B00005RYP7|3.0|My three-star rating is, I think, a tad generous, but it seemed more fair than two, because this movie does have some real suspense. It seems that every young actress that starts out innocent these days must soon get corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski so lovably sweet and innocent in DEEP IMPACT? Then her innocence acquired a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Still good and likeable. But after that came the seemingly obligatory squandering of innocence. For Leelee that lurid rite of passage was exceptioally harsh and gratuitous, in a bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then her characters seem to have an inexorable element of sniveling brat, too potent to be completely eclipsed by heavy plot elements making her a put-upon character, whether playing a terminally ill girl in HERE ON EARTH or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the name of it's residents. Mr. Glass is played by Soren Starsgaard, who, if not in danger of becoming typecast already, certainly is after this movie. He's a relative of Leelee's character and becoms her guardian after her parents die in a car crash. At first at least, Mr Glass seems a put-upon character. Early on we see him being beaten up by obviously unsavory characters, loan sharks as it turns out. How then do we want to see the movie develop from this point? Well, for me, not exactly as it in fact does develop. There may be overkill in some characterizations. And what looks like the developing plot tensions may end up so eclipsed and overwhelmed as to be forgotten. That's not exactly what I wanted. A little bit more of things being what they seemed in the right places would have made it more to my liking. But if your tastes are somewhat different and those objections matter little or none to you, you might find this a quite satisfying thriller as it builds up to a taut climax.
B000002ITG|5.0|All of Led Zep's albums (with the possible except of Led Zep IV and Physical Graffiti) have had some outstanding tracks, but some not so great ones. And here, in one handy package, are virtually all the outstanding ones. This is nearly as good quality as buying all 8 seperate albums, but much much cheaper (I got the British edition, which doesn't have the interview disc but has the two music discs, for [amt], which is about [amt]!) It has all the classics, from the opener 'Communication Breakdown' through 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You', 'Whole Lotta Love', 'Since I've Been Loving You', 'Black Dog', 'Rock and Roll' and my favorite track of all time 'Stairway To Heaven', then onto the second disc which is concerned with Physical Graffiti (once described by British music magazine Q as the heavy alternative to Seargeant Pepper) and the other experimental albums, and contains more great numbers like 'The Rain Song', 'Houses of The Holy' (which, contary to logic, does not appear on the album of the same name but on Physical Graffiti), 'Kashmir' and closer 'In The Evening'. It is a great place to start for begginers to Led Zep, and despite some ommisions (where is When The Levee Breaks or What Is And What Should Never Be) it is a wonderful collection of music and a brilliant introduction to one of the most pioneering rock bands of the 20th century.
B000003S2K|5.0|Excellent Music ... by far, Brian Eno at his best.  I first heard Eno's Music for Airports on the &quot;Hearts of Space&quot; series, and I was hooked.  A tops in my music collection.
B00005R87Q|5.0|the first day i got this movie which was the day it came out me and my brother watched it about 3 times and like 2 times the next day.  even though the whole plot wasnt what critics would like it was good enough for me well anyway i thought it was cool. and since i dont know too much about cars and my older brother is like trying to get his cat all supped up i kinda got into this whole car thing.  and to tell you the truth i think it kicks ....
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This album does not seek to paint a comprehensive portrait of the Beatles' output. It is merely a collection of their number one hits. While it vexes me a great deal that 'Strawberry Fields Forever,' for example, is absent from the mix, the fact remains that it was the first single the Beatles released that stalled at number two.<br />It is easy to be cynical and say that the band didn't need another greatest hits packaging in time for the holidays and all that, but let's be realistic. Before the Beatles released this album there was no definitive greatest hits available. The &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; albums possessed twenty songs each, they were awfully expensive, and they stretched beyond simply containing the hits. The Anthologies, on the other hand, make no attempt to be greatest hits installments; rather, they focus on previously unreleased versions of the Beatles well-known and obscure songs all the same.<br />&quot;1&quot; is exactly what it claims to be. If you only want their most popular material, buy this album. This functions very well as an introduction to the band, and it may very well lead you to buy some of their albums. As an avid fan of the Beatles, I think it's great that there is finally an affordable collection like this available.
B00005QDW1|2.0|this cd is not the no doubt that i know! they seemed to abandon their original sound for a more pop sound. although i like some of the songs and some are good to dance to like &quot;making out&quot; it's not the same awesome sound that same from tragic kingdom. for anyone who likes the original no doubt sound, i don't recommend it, but it might appeal to some people.
B000002TYX|3.0|It's a shame that the Beatles didn't put more thought into this, the first volume of the Anthology series. Why? Because this is simply the worst of the bunch and it managed to turn a lot of Beatles' fans off to the entire Anthology output.<br />That being said, this is not a bad investment for a serious fan of the band. The early material presented on the first disc is hardly essential compared to their released output, but you won't find all of these songs in the same place for this price anywhere else. That is, the Beatles pre &quot;Please Please Me&quot; output had previously been available on scattered, expensive bootlegs.<br />The second disc, however, is redeeming. There are a treasure trove of live versions of early classics such as 'Twist and Shout.' But the real interest of the disc lies in the alternate versions of songs like 'Eight Days a Week' and 'And I Love Her.' The latter is much faster than the version the Beatles chose to release. In any case, this disc contains most of their early standards through late 1964.<br />Nevertheless if only one Anthology installment is in your budget, pick the second or the third volume instead as they contain more groundbreaking material.  If, however, the Beatles are the apple of your eye (sorry)as they are in my case, you will want to make this investment to help round out your collection.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Mogwai's best album to date, Rock Action is 30+ minutes of beautiful, beautiful noise.  Mogwai is at the forefront of a wonderful music scene that has evolved in Glasgow, Scotland.<BR>Although it is a bit on the short side, Rock Action worth every penny.  Each album these guys put out is better than the last.  It's scary to think of what they will do next.  Mogwai on CD is only eclipsed by Mogwai live.  Catch them on tour if you can.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Is this movie trying to take itself seriously? I must admit that it's visually stunning, and has moments of pure greatness where the emotions soar. BUT...<br />In the end, it comes off a little too &quot;comic book&quot; to be a great film. Overly trendy, the movie seems to pander a lot to the latest pop culture. Hardly any of the music is original, and it gets a little tedious after awhile hearing turn-of-the-century characters belt out &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; or &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; And sometimes, Ewen McGregor just runs around with an idiot grin singing &quot;Come what may...&quot; over and over.<br />A great movie with a lot of distractions is no longer great, to sum up. I found it to be very promising, but very average. Same goes for the extras on the DVD -- there are a lot of chances to shine but few times where it actually happens. Buyer beware: Rent it first to see it suits you.
B00005JKES|4.0|If you loved the show, buy the DVD set.  IMHO, Twin Peaks is second only to the Simpsons as the most interesting TV show to air on a major network.  Any show that has a sequence with a dancing, backward talking midget is OK in my book.<br />My biggest complaint about the DVD set has been exhaustively registered by others, so I won't go into it.  The extras are not all that great either.  Still it's nice to have the first season and the DVD picture quality is what makes this worthwhile.  Now I just have to wait for season 2...
B0000029DD|5.0|More than enough has been said online and in print about this album.  All I'll add is that as far as I'm concerned, this is the best album that came out in the 90s, bar none.
B000005L86|5.0|Very little to add here folks, especially if you've just been working your way up the eulogies on this review list!<br />However, &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot;, for once, lives up to the hype.<br />This is truly sublime, inspirational music of the highest order; pure magic for roots lovers the world over.<br />Like all the best reggae, the Congos music has the deceptively simple quality of hymns, which is what these songs really are.<br />I've had it for years, and this record never fails to hit me in the head, the heart, and the guts. My little baby girl loves it too - always a good recommendation :)<br />Don't deny yourself this truly beautiful music. The Congos, Perry and their incredible reggae superstar band made the world a better place with this one. Thankyouthankyouthankyou!<br />Oh yeah, and on a similar note, I'd like to put in a shout for the criminally underrated &quot;Children of Jah&quot; by the Chantells and Friends, another Blood &amp; Fire scorcher. If you like &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot;, you will _love_ this.
B00005QIPH|4.0|All I have heard about this band recently is how good they are and how they basically bought their record deal.  I had gone to many web sites and saw review after review saying that this album was one of the best albums of the year.  After hearing &quot;Love and Theft&quot; by Bob Dylan I could not see anything topping that excpet for maybe Ryan Adams' &quot;Gold,&quot; which I have not hear yet, I decided that I would pick up &quot;Is This It&quot; by the Strokes and give it a shot.  I must say that after listening to this album, I am a believer in this album.  This album is a definite throwback.  As a child of the 80's I was brought up when slick production was beginning to be the norm.  I remember the day I bought Led Zepplen I, I was blown away by how good the album was and how every song seemed to be great.  A far cry to today's day and age where an album is considered great if it has three good songs.  Very few artists in the 80's and 90's made albums that had one  great song after another.  &quot;Is this It? by the Strokes is a refreshing time warp back in time, it fulfills my wishing that I was a child of the 60's and 70's.  Each song flows right into the other.  The only problem that takes getting used to is the inaudible voice that is used in some songs, but after a few listens it becomes nostalgic and adds to the throwback theme of this album.  This album flows and is just long enough (35 minutes) to satisfy the soul.  I still like Bob Dylan's Love and Theft better but &quot;Is this It?&quot; deserves a spot right next to Dylan in the cd collection.  I think that this album is a 50/50 shot for music lovers, you'll either love it, or you'll hate it.  If you hate the first song, you'll probably hate the whole album because the album sticks to the same pace throughout.
B00005NWM3|5.0|The whole CD is good! I don't think there's one song that I reach for the &quot;skip&quot; button on the whole CD. If you like &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, you'll like all the songs. Two Words: GET IT
0783227272|3.0|Wow!  What  a  good  movie!  Those  where  my  words  the  FIRST  time  I  watched  it.  Then  I  watched  it  again  and  thought  more.  I  decided  that  it  was  good,  but  not  great  as  I  had  thought  the  first  time.  The  bad  pionts  are  namely:  it  is  more  about  lawmen  and  law  rather  than  the  Africans,  and  far  too  extreme  for  most  viewers,  not  including  myself.   And  the  biggest  con  for  the  terribly  anticlimatic  ending.  I  mean  I  understand  that  it  is  accurate  and  probably  what  really  happened,  BUT  COME  ON!  I  sat  through  the  whole  2  hours  and  30  minutes  just  to  get  a  letdown?  And  to  make  it  worse,  you  have  to  read  it,  why  couldn't  they  have  showed  it  out?  Like  I  said,  it  is  probably  realistic,  but  be  a  little  creative  and  give  us  a  type  of  ending  that  made  THE  SHAWSHANK  REDEMPTION  such  a  masterpiece.  Even  the  director  Steven  Spielburg  made  an  awesome  ending  in  SHINDLER'S  LIST  that  killed  this  movie.  I  am  not  talking  about  the  few  minutes  before  the  end,  those  were  cool  and  formed  some  kind  of  freedom  among  the  Africans  that  were  illegaly  traded.  I  am  talking  about  the  VERY  END  WHERE  THEY  SHOW  THE  BOAT  LEAVING  AND  MAKE  YOU  READ  THE  REST.<br />  Besides  all  of  that,  it  could  have  been  a  masterpiece.  There  is  a  great  cast,  great  speech  at  the  end  by  ANTHONY  HOPKINS,  awesome  music,  good  DIOLOUGE  and  DIALECT(  especially  with  the  Africans  ),  and  MORGAN  FREEMAN  always  kicks  butt  with  his  acting.  Just  don't  be  expecting  a  great  deal  of  him  in  this  flick  though.<br />  Also  to  mention:  MATTHEY  McCONAUGHEY  has  almost  the  exact  same  role  in  this  movie  that  he  did  in  A  TIME  TO  KILL.  PETE  POSTLETHWAITE  finally  has  hair  on  his  head!!!LOL!  And  lastly,  Anthony  Hopkins  sould  have  won  best  actor  for  this  movie(must  have  been  a  tough  call,  he  was  nominated  against  ROBIN  WILLIAMS  in  the  highly  overrated  GOOD  WILL  HUNTING.<br />  If  anyone  wants  the  PLOT,  here  it  is:  Illegaly  traded  Africans  are  boarded  on  the  boat  LA  AMISTAD.  They  revolt  against  the  crew  members  and  only  leave  two  alive  to  steer  the  ship  back  to  their  homeland  AFRICA.  They  are  cought  by  some  other  ship,  taken  to  AMERICA  to  wait  for  their  fate  on  trail.  But  a  group  of  lawmen  and  lawyers  accompany  them  to  help  prove  that  they  were  illegaly   traded.<br />  Overall:  Well  acted,  good  screenplay,  accurate,  but  doesn't  welcome  nomal  movie  viewers  as  much  as  history  buffs,  unlike  the  ultimate  SHINDLER'S  LIST.  Add  it  to  your  &quot;hollywood  human  triumph&quot;  movie  collection.<br />  On  a  4  star  rating,  this  gets  3  stars  by  me.

B00005B4GU|5.0|With all due respect to other reviewers and<BR>their different complaints, this album is, in <BR>its' own way, flawless. Sorry if I sound like <BR>just another hopeless fan. Actually I never listen to Pablo<BR>Honey or The Bends anymore but I consider <BR>Ok Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac to be excercises <BR>in perfection that make all other pop music seem<BR>to exist on a different dimension. When i bought <BR>this album I was dumbfounded by how good it was. <BR>Now, everyday since I bought it I like it more more.<br />Now, this isn't to say that everyone is going<BR>to like this. I have good friends who still think <BR>The Bends is their best. To me though, Radiohead<BR>was just a rock band then with artistic touches and<BR>now Radiohead is pure art and its members content with<BR>nothing less than a masterpiece. (But boy, does it rock!)<BR>As to which of their latest three albums is the best. That's <BR>a really tough one. To me they're all uniquely amazing.<BR>Hope anyone that takes my advice will agree with me. <br />Just remember that you might need to listen a few times before<BR>the album really sinks in. For whatever reason, it took me<BR>like 6 months of off and on listening before I totally loved<BR>ok Computer! <BR>I'm also a big fan of The Smashing Pumpkins, Elliot Smith, Bjork<BR>Sigor Ros, Bright Eyes, Pink Floyd and Pulp.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Can't say I don't love No Doubt's style, most of their songs are awesome on this CD, but I can't deny how acouple lagged, which is why I'm giving 4 stars. I don't regret buying this CD in the least, but I know No Doubt could have definately done better. No Doubt about it.
0385501005|5.0|Light and breezy comedy about a twenty-something guy who really loves -- but can't quite commit to -- his wonderful girlfriend.  <br />Duffy is a twenty-eight year old aspiring comic, and while he waits for his big break, can think of nothing he likes better than watching &quot;Eastenders&quot; and eating toast.  His girlfriend, Mel, wants Duffy to marry her.  Duffy loves Mel -- but unfortunately has panic attacks while shopping for furnishings in Ikea, and can't imagine a life without his slacker roommate.  The story follows Duffy's plight as he tries to get it together before he loses Mel forever.<br />Smooth and funny, this book takes a warm and thoughtful look at twenty something romances, commitmentphobes and true love.  If you enjoy the British chick book genre, you'll love &quot;Mr. Committment.&quot;
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor contains the perfect ingredients for a classic of epic proportions. Many critics proclaimed that the film focused heavily more on romance which made its beginning tedious, but its very few opionated negatives cannot touch the foundation of this films magnificent values. Some segements may not historically accurate, but no one can ever portray a perfect image, thus Pearl Harbor accomplishes its goal of rendering the horrific event of defeat that took place in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th, 1941. The actors pull off excellent performances that compliment the near flawless visual effects. The cast includes: Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett as two young, daring pilots, Kate Hartnett, a commited, beautiful nurse, and Jon Voight, as President Rossevelt. Along with special effects, romance, and suspense, Pearl Harbor has vital morals that fit in perfectly to the plot. Jon Voight delievers a strong, outstanding performance as President Rossevelt. This movie is definetly for you if you enjoy romance, action, drama, and real-life based events. The DVD is top-notch with numerous special features that appeal with much interest.
1878424319|1.0|I kept waiting for the pay off, reading page after page of how my parents and culture have shaped my world view, how I should be careful what I say because words can hurt, how I shouldn't take seriously the criticism of others, etc, etc.  Sadly, there was nothing more to this book.  I might recommend it, however, to young teens. The message and reading level seems focused at this age group.<br />But, if you're a sophisticated young person or an adult, invest your time and dollars better in buying anything by Sydney Banks (The Missing Link is highly recommended), or Thich Hanh Nhat.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|After reading reviews on Amazon and downloading a few songs, I decided to buy both of her CD's. And I was not disappointed! Fiona Apple has the most beautiful and insightful lyrics that one can listen to again and again. <BR>&quot;I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy&quot;- Paper Bag<BR>Both her CD's are excellent, and although I do love a lot of the songs on Tidal, this one is overall a better CD. However if you enjoy music which reaches into you and makes you think, give these a try. Beautiful, haunting and definately worth hitting repeat for
B000059ZLH|4.0|I was also disappointed that the audio was not 5.1 surround, but is in stereo.  That said, I thought the audio was superb for the stereo format.  It sounds better on my system than any other stereo-only dvd concert.  However, I must point out that my system is very high quality, audiofile equipment (speakers are Thiel 3.6's).  This system brings out every tiny bit of sound, and as a result, many older cd's and some stereo dvd's are too bright and harsh sounding, with too much treble.  The Dream Theater dvd, which some have called muffled, somes out sounding perfect on my system.  I do have to turn up the power a little, but my power amp is 250 watts per channel, so that's no problem.<BR>  As for the content of the dvd, wow!  I play guitar and keyboards, and Petrucci and Rudess are phenomenal.  I'm not a die hard fan, having only the first album, but this dvd is one of the best performed concerts I've ever seen.  This is not a case of just winging it - these guys have practiced many intricate parts, and it shows.  The odd meters are difficult at first, but with repeated listening, it's not bad at all, and often is more interesting than straight 4/4.  I also loved the commentary.
B00005R87Q|5.0|If you love cars, racing, or both, you absolutely must see this movie.  There's more street racing and car lingo in this than the Dukes of Hazzard!  If you at ALL like car-chases, than this movie is a must see!
B00003CXRP|4.0|There's so much to praise in this movie about a modern, ambitious man who, isolated on a hostile island, must learn how to survive and find the hidden depths of his humanity. He bonds with a volleyball, &quot;Wilson,&quot; which represents many things: the protagonist's need for a friend, conscience, and is, with its blood-stained face, even a reminder of the protagonist's mortality.<br />So much of the struggle on the island is so universal that people from all over the world could follow the sequences without the aid of subtitles. Primitive and biblical themes are wonderfully developed: the making of fire, the arduous learning process of trial and error, the ecstasy of tasting food as if for the first time.<br />During the protagonist's struggles he learns to grieve and to find a cathartic way to unleash all his pent up sorrow, as when he loses his volleyball companion &quot;Wilson,&quot; and in doing so he finds his humanity.<br />So much detail and mythic power informs the island sequences that it is a frustrating disappointment when we arrive at the movie's final act, the protagonist's attempt to patch things up with his girlfriend, who, having thought he had died in a plane crash, has married and borne children. This final act is sloppy, sappy, and arbitrary and seems to have been made by a lesser director.<br />Nevertheless, I still recommend this film for the very compelling island sequences, which highlight Hanks' talents better than I have ever seen.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD is perfection out of the entire Disney lineup.  Tons of extras, incredible digital remastering of a 50+ year old print, the whole package is simply fantastic.  A must for anyone who loves Disney or Snow White in particular.
B00005R23X|5.0|This was one of the most original Dracula movies that I have ever seen. The outstanding cast of actors makes this film all the better.Gary Oldman,Anthony Hopkins,Keneau Reeves,and Winona<br />Ryder play outstanding roles in this movie. The character played by Ryder resembles an old love of Dracula's.He takes her to Tranyslvania with our heros in hot pursuit.The special effects in this movie also makes it very entertaining.The scenery used in Transylvania makes the movie even more spooky. This is a very good movie that you will enjoy. Dracula was cast in a different<br />but effective light. Buy it.
B00003CXE7|2.0|I realise I am voicing a minority opinion here but I just did not enjoy Gladiator. For me, it was an ok movie and nothing more. It certainly does not compare favourably to classic Roman epics like Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre at best. I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.<BR>The best movie of 2000 was Titus. The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare. Too bad the academy did not agree with me.
B000005H3M|5.0|My father played this album for years as I was growing up.  I knew every solo by heart.  When the CD came out I bought it, and continue to listen to it all the time.  I think this album is better overall than the &quot;Swinging New Big Band&quot; album--but they are quite similar in the way they sound.<br />  By the way, if you are new to Buddy Rich, the Buddy Rich Big Band of the late sixties is VERY different than any other era, before or after.  I don't care for any of his 40's &amp; 50's stuff, and little of his 70's stuff.  But this band is absolutely the best at hard-driving, swinging big band jazz around.  The first 5 tracks are the best, and I can listen to them in a row, and get so caught up in the music that I wonder where the time has gone when they are done.  I strongly recommend this album!  (And, based on recommendations here--and the sound samples--I am going to buy the Mercy Mercy CD immediately.)
B00003CXGG|4.0|When I first saw trailers for this movie, I thought it was some hastily put together, no plot, American Martial Arts Movie. I was very surprised to see that the movie had 2 plots intertwined and took up most of the movie. You might say that the movie focused too much on the plot.<br />The action sequences are fantastic, however, the X-Ray death sequences feel out of place at times. The movie is unexpected at times and is very entertaining.<br />Also, the DVD is full of extras including Aaliyah's video for &quot;Try Again&quot;, the movies top track that is very catchy. It can also remind you of your old elementary school teachers. I don't ever really feal like trying again after I fail.<br />On a 1-10 scale, this movie is an 8. Wait, I forgot to include the great acting, 8.5
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt. After that I forgot most of what I read and then had to reread it about four years later and now read it every year just to remind myself what a classic book is really like.
0385505833|1.0|This book is awful.  I have read each Grisham novel and he has hit the bottom hard.  It is apparent that Grisham and the publishers know that many people will rush out and buy his new books based on his reputation--so why put in any effort anymore.  I will no longer buy his books based on his reputation, I will wait for him to put in a good effort.  The  price for this novelette equates to stealing.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Despite what you might think of Fiona Apple, the (sometimes wacky) celebrity -- you owe it to yourself to get acquainted with Fiona Apple, the artist.  There is no doubt that Ms. Apple is a tremendously talented musician and writer, and will be revered as one of the greatest artists of the 90's and 00's.<br />Apple's melodies are complex, yet dulcet:  the chords are chaotic, the songs tend to have 2 or 3 movements, they weave jazz influences with electronic instruments, and the lyrics are thick and verbose.  The songs could easily come off as pretentious or angry -- but instead they spill forth with genuine emotion and resonate with the listener.<br />&quot;Fast As You Can&quot; is complex and racy.  &quot;I Know&quot; is bittersweet and leaves the listener breathless.  &quot;Mistake&quot; and &quot;Get Gone&quot; are energizing, fiery songs.  And all of the songs demonstrate Apple's genius for taking seemingly dissimilar styles, and marrying them in a way so it seems as though the styles were fated to be joined.<br />If I had to rate the album's songs separately, I would give 8 of the 10 songs a full, 5-star rating.  This is the CD your music collection wants.  Most definitely one of the best CDs of 2000.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile.  It centers around a bunch of kids drag-racing their &quot;souped-up&quot; economy cars and an (eventually) corrupt cop who infiltrates their world.   The dialog is horrible as is most of the acting.  At one point early in the movie, one of the racers makes fun of one of the others because he was &quot;granny shifting&quot; and not &quot;double-clutching&quot;.  Ha ha ha.  &quot;Double-clucthing&quot; in a drag race with modern cars with syncros?  Yeah, sure....<br />You'll see kids drag-racing their Honda's and Eclipses, complete with huge spoilers that in the real world would harm performance. As noted in an earlier review, the movie does make a pretty good NOS commercial.<br />The final street drag scene is the only &quot;good one&quot; and is fairly realistic except that you'll see a 900hp (yeah, right) Charger popping a wheelie while burning the rubber on the rear tires at the same time--simply not possible.<br />Also, it is pretty clear that none of the actors had a clue on how to realistically fire a gun--much less a submachine gun.<br />The good news is that if you're a teen and don't know much about cars, don't care if the acting is poor, and think a Honda Civic with a coffee can exhaust tip is a high-performance automoble on par with a 3rd generation RX-7 or a Supra, you'll probably love the movie.<br />If you're an adult who likes &quot;B&quot; movies this one is pretty amusing as a result of being such a horrible movie.<br />Everyone else should stay away.
B0000021RB|4.0|What? You thought Chicago was a ballad band? A listen to their CTA album (the band's debut) will correct that misconception very quickly.<br />The only singles you might recognize are the full length versions are &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is&quot;, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, and &quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot;. The rest offers a collection of raw material which you may only find on heavy album rock stations.<br />&quot;Introduction&quot; is an excellent piece which provides a sampling of musical varieties the band has potential for. Its followed by the three aformentioned singles. Then the driving tune &quot;Listen&quot; and &quot;Poem 58&quot; on which Terry Kath develops a incomparable guitar introduction.<br />&quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; detracts from the quality of the album. It is Terry Kath free forming on a guitar without any musical inclination, something better reserved for live concerts than wasting air space in one's car or living room.<br />&quot;South California Purples&quot; provides a soothing,driving transition from the electrical onslaught of &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot;. &quot;I'm a Man&quot; features a tight drum solo by Danny Seraphine.<br />The album winds down with a taste of the band's pro-peace posturing in &quot;Someday&quot;. The number features an introduction utilizing a recording of the crowds at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. &quot;Liberation&quot; represents an instrumental which starts utilizing the entire band but ends up like a jam session minus the horns.<br />The album clearly shows the raw talent this group of men had in the late sixties. There's something for all tastes on it.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This CD is wonderful!  I ran out to the store and bought it the day it first became available, and I have listened to it for hours.  I enjoyed it the first time I heard it.  After watching the movie (four times &amp; counting) nearly a month later, I haven't been able to take this out of my CD player for very long (sometimes switching it for Blind Guardian's &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot; for variety).<br />Howard Shore has really captured the sweeping emotions of Peter Jackson's excellent film: from the mythic opening track &quot;The Prophecy;&quot; to the simple and delightful &quot;Concerning Hobbits;&quot; to the imperious and frightening &quot;Shadow of the Past&quot; and &quot;Treason of Isengard;&quot; to the enchantment of &quot;The Council of Elrond/Aniron;&quot; to the determination and triumph of &quot;The Ring Goes South;&quot; to the desperation and grief of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum;&quot; to the weirdness of &quot;Lothlorien;&quot; to the bittersweet &quot;Breaking of the Fellowship.&quot;  Enya's haunting &quot;May It Be&quot; is the perfect ending to the soundtrack.<br />My favourite bits of the soundtrack are tracks 11, 12 &amp; 13, 15, 17, 18.  Shore uses very powerful choral work in several of the pieces, performed stirringly by the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola.  Edward Ross, in particular, makes &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; incredibly powerful.<br />&quot;Concerning Hobbits,&quot; which becomes the hobbit theme, reminds me of the hymn &quot;This is My Father's World.&quot;  I think that's appropriate, because of the innocence and simplicity of the hobbits.<br />The soundtrack is made infinitely more powerful by viewing the movie.  I think that's true of all movies, of course; after seeing the movie you know exactly what's happening during moments of the soundtrack.  Just as there were parts of the movie that moved me to tears, there are parts of the soundtrack that nearly do so, during repeated listenings.<br />This is probably one of my top five soundtracks of all time, and it's coming close to edging out number one Gettysburg and number two Gladiator.  I heartily recommend this CD!
0385312083|1.0|I have been aware of this book since seeing the movie for the first time over twenty-five years ago. I finally got around to reading it recently. It is appalling that this is considered a classic and that it is studied as an example of American literature.<br />Slaughterhouse five deals with Billy Pilgrim, a WWII veteran who is \\"unstuck in time\\" and jumps back and forth from his experience as prisoner of war in WWII Dresden to mundane suburban concerns as a wealthy optometrist to life as a zoo exhibit on the planet Tralfalmadore. <br />Being \\"unstuck in time\\" could be a metaphor for mental illness but Vonnegut's telling of it makes me feel otherwise. He actually means for the reader to believe in this infantile nonsense. <br />The novel is written in a childish absurdist style that becomes wearisome very quickly. This short novel of 187 pages has little to say: War is bad, killing is bad. Duh. There is the idiotic repetition of the phrase \\"and so it goes\\" every time death is mentioned. Even the death of bacteria or a stale glass of water. <br />Vonnegut also implies that he did not want to write about this subject but has somehow been forced. The opening chapter details how he had not dwelt on the memories of his wartime experiences for decades and was finally forced to reflect on them in writing this book. This unwillingness shows. I estimate that less than a quarter of the novel actually deals with the events he witnessed in WWII. If Vonnegut had been able to write a normal wartime memoir that would have been a much more interesting book. Instead we have this puerile fantasy that, perversely, is treated as great literature.<br />I am especially amazed that this book is studied in English courses across America. Message to students: Question the judgment of any teacher who presents this as an example of anything other than worthless ...that should have never been published.
6302636779|5.0|The end of this movie contains the most important visual representation of an individual's transformation in all film history. Well, maybe not, it is second only to the ending of Kubrick's 2001.
0441172717|4.0|Dune is, right off the bat, amazing...its a world so amazingly put together, that it just attests to Frank Herbert's genius...the only world created in depth as well as Dune's is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings<br />still, being 14 when i read it, i got lost sometimes, and had a hard time understanding the actual writing of Herbert's, not the story itself...though i managed to figure it out, Herbert could have written it simpler, but i prefer to instead recognize it as great literature that i was just too young to understand<br />on that note of literature, this and (again) Lord of the Rings are in my view, two of the very few sci-fi/fantasy books that can be accepted as literature...i doubt i could look my honors english teacher in the eye and call a book like Sheffield's Aftermath, or Hubbard's Battlefield Earth literature...Dune IS literature, and excellent literature at that...<br />though it has a great number of sequels (im still dragging my way through Dune Messiah), Dune can easily stand on its own as a single novel, one that i suggest for anyone to read, SF fan or not<br />Paul Muad'Dib is a great, true character...like a real person, he doubts himself and thinks about problems that a real person would think about...he second guesses himself and hates what he has to do at times..just like in real life, which i think is great writing on Herbert's part<br />the society Herbert created is genius...with the spice melange, the fremen way of life, and the sandworms, which i have a strange interest in, and love any mention of them...the Bene Gesserit is a stroke of genius and the mind capabilities of Herbert's characters make the society...just well, amazing<BR>as read in the beginning of the second book, there also exists Bene Tleilaxu, another genius creation of Herbert's<br />Dune is, by itself, one of the best books i have read (albeit a small list, but i plan on adding to it)...i doubt my praise is needed, as writers like Arthur C. Clarke have given Dune their seal of approval....still, i just wanted to throw it in, because i think no matter how many times its been praised, if it is really worth it, then it will continue to get praise...so here is my small piece of praise for one of the classics
078322804X|5.0|Someday someone will write an essay about how this film truly captures some essential elements of American culture.  It showcases blues music by some genuine greats, such as John Lee Hooker and Aretha Franklin; it presents an &quot;anti-authoritarian&quot; quest in the vein of Twain's &quot;Huck Finn;&quot; and it does these things with an undercurrent of Individualistic American Religion--these white boys with blues in their blood are on a mission from God!  <BR>Everything in this film works, when you realize it is the only film of its genre: a working-class musical about cars.  Ackroyd and Belushi's dead pan delivery evokes the cool cowboys of the old westerns; the car chases and the flight from the police, a crazed girlfriend, Illinois Nazis and the Good Ol' Boys evokes Huck Finn's decision to flee sivilization-- the Blues Brothers have been there before and they can't stand it.<BR>1000 years from now they'll still be watching this film in awe.<BR>In every way an American Classic, like &quot;One Flew Over...&quot; and &quot;On the Road.&quot;<BR>The DVD is good also, with a nice documentary about the making of the film, and some scenes that were cut by Universal when the film went over two hours long...<BR>PS--stay away from the sequel; it's horrible and in no way related to this movie in theme or importance.
B00004Z459|5.0|this album is one of the best albums ive heard...too many albums today are built around one or two radio singles and a bunch of other horrible or mediocre at best songs...Hybrid Theory is one of the few albums i own that i can listen to straight through and honestly say i enjoy every song...<br />the lyrics are mesmerizing, especially in songs like in the end and papercut, the switching between the vox and the rap is really cool and the guitar riffs just drive every song on...and then there are the piano intros to a few songs, most notably in the end...that is one of the coolest riffs written by any band, and its not even a guitar riff...papercut is the strongest song, followed by in the end, but every track is just awesome, original music....BUY THIS ALBUM
0345413377|5.0|This book is masterfully written, every detail was thought through to it's fullest. As you read this book, you fall in love with Will and Lyra and their exciting adventure that takes them to many different worlds, one of which is the world of the dead where Lyra, Will, Lady Salmakia, and Tailys are seperated from their daemons. The ending of this book absolutely tears your heart out, it' incredibly tear jerking and when you finish the book you think that there was a mistake-- it can't just end like that?? But it does and you feel horrible and wonderful at the same time, wising that you cold change the unfortunateevents that cause the book to end in the horrible way it does-- but no horribly bad, horribly and infinately sad. In a way, this book is like Romeo and Juliet- a masterpiece that you wish woldbe different, but yo can't change it and in some ways you feel it should be kept the same. I definately do not reccomend this book to anyone under the age of 15 because it's a little hard to handle. The writing is beatiful, the characters are lovable and the adventure is thrilling. Definately do not read this ook if you haven't read the Golden Compass or the Subtle Knife.
0553275976|2.0|This book was a painfully unbalanced story to read because of the ridiculousness of the story. I rate it two stars because the author at least kept me going to see how it comes out in the end. <br />Mostly it is a statement of the author's perspective of rich Wall Street, the poor Bronx, the sad shape of New York's criminal justice system [obviously pre-Rudy G.] and everyone else who sees life only as a game. Every character is either abusive of the power they have, or jealous because they have none. The only redeeming and real character in this book was detective Martin [and perhaps that is only because the author didn't have time to poke fun at him too... or maybe he did and I didn't get it.].<br />The author tries to make a hero out of a drunk, two-bit reporter. He was actually nothing more than a pawn used by others to minipulate public opinion. The main character, Sherman, is a successful, high-powered Wall Street bonds trader. One would expect him to have more intellegence. Sherman makes a lot of unbelievably stupid mistakes in his personal life that are impossibly contrary to his successful professional life. We are supposed to believe that he can read into the minds of the international bonds &quot;crowd&quot;, predict market futures, and minipulate complicated billion dollar deals, but is manipulated by a sexy gold-digger just because of her Southern charm?<br />Oh, yes, there was one other believable character in this book - Sherman's 6-year-old daughter, Campbell. Poor thing... her parents love her, but are so weak, she will never grow up normal.<br />I admit, I didn't realize this was supposed to be a satire until I read the reviews on this site. Had I known, I never would have bought the book. There is no one in the book a reader can (or would want to) identify with or feel sorry for. Well, maybe Henry Lamb - but we never really know him.
B00005QDW1|5.0|For everyone out there who is critisizing this CD~I say SHUT UP! It's inventive and different from anything out there. Instead of just keeping to their pop/punk roots, No Doubt has dared to explore the uncharted areas of music. <BR>  All the songs on this CD are extrememly well-written and sung beautifully but Gwen and the band.<br />1. *Intro* Cute, classy, very good harmonizing!<BR>2. *Hella Good* Awesome song with a great beat and amazing music! It has a very techno-modern twang that's impossible to not like.<BR>3.*Hey Baby* Everyone has heard this single, and surprisingly, it's not the only song that shines on this album...the rest of the tunes are just as noteworthy.<BR>4. *Making Out* A really cute song about a girl who's missing the guy she loves and anticipates them 'making out'. Although it sounds a little suggestive, there really isn't anything in this song that I wouldn't let younger kids listen to.<BR>5. *Underneath it all* A great song~not one of the catchier ones of the album but still worth listening too.<BR>6.*Detective* AWESOME! It's the neatest song with awesome lyrics. Very creative, about a girl who's searching to see if her guy is cheating on her.<br />The rest of the songs on this album are just as good as the first six. I love the fact that each song has a different feel. No Doubt has done wonderfully on this CD, and has faithfully not conformed to the mold that most bands of their type fall into.<BR>GOOD JOB NO DOUBT!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Either there are two actually legit albums floating around out there, or most of the people who have reviewed this album are reviewing a doctored up version of the album that is traveling around the internet. My boss downloaded the album and burned it on CD to play in the office where I work about two weeks before it was due to release, and he was remarking how he thought No Doubt was taking a risk releasing it, and while he liked it he was pretty sure that the mainstream public would not. However, three weeks later after he'd gone to the store and actually bought the album, we discovered that the store-bought album and the contraband internet album were completely different. It seemed as though someone had gone through and taken pieces of every track and rather professionally looped them up. The end result? Two completely different albums with two completely different sets of songs. Some people like one set better than the other, but the fact is that the highly repetitive and &quot;boring&quot; version doesn't seem to be the *real* album. I suggest that you head to your local music store to listen to a few full tracks before you decide whether or not to believe online reviews.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I love this CD, which hasn't left my player since I bought it.  It has every great song I listened to when they originally came out.  It has great dance songs as well as a few of her ballads, and the order of the songs on the cd seems to be well thought out.  This cd would be great for parties, or get togethers with friends.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid over and over on vhs. Now thats it on dvd im ecstatic....nough said. The greatest video of my childhood.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|It's awful.  I love music videos and I also love movies that are very fast paced the way the camera was moving at times was just brilliant.  It had very original characters, the movie overall was very original and inventive.  So all the pieces are there for me to love this film, but I hated it.  Not just hated but completly detested this piece...  A so called movie.  Maybe the reason I hate it was because of about 7 of us that were watching the film I was the only stupid moron to stay till the end hoping for some kind of miracle that would some how transform this...into a descent movie.  Needless to say that miracle never came.  Why others love this movie is just mind blowing.  What do they see? What do they think?  How on earth could they watch this and be entertain. This is just one man's opinion but for god sake stay away from this film. And to others who feel the way I do please write a review or at least rate it this movie is fooling alot of people with it's average.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I won't go into detail about this Pinocchioesque storyline, as other people here have already done that. It was truly amazing. The visuals are spectacular. The only place the movie fails is in the last half hour. After an incredibly interesting and heartfelt ride, I found the ending not only somewhat boring, but confusing unless you pay very careful attention. Even with that criticism, I still recommend it. Just don't expect a big payoff at the end.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen in my life! Granded when I went to see it had no idea what the movie was about. The only idea I did have was when someone told me it was about a ... house five seconds before the movie started. But let me tell you right now it is soooo much more. The color, the visual effects, the directing, the acting, and last but certinly not least, THE SING! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor light up the screen not only in the singing and dancing but also in the extrodnary acting. All in all the best performence I have seen in both theses very talented actors. Baz Luthrmann and Craig Pearice do an abosoltue wonderful job of telling an wonderful love story through song.
0684857219|4.0|This is an excellent book for the would be bodybuilder. It provides indepth information on training programmes and outlines a multitude of exercises and training techniques that can help boost your progress. It can also be viewed as more of an inspirational tool because of the fantastically detailed pictures of all the top bodybuilders rather than a concise exercise physiology book but it will provide individuals with a sound base to become proficient 'muscle builders'. <br />There seems to be a lot of confusion in the earlier reviews concerning the use of 20 set's per body part? If for example you are aiming to build your thighs, this would involve 5 sets of squats, the first set being a warm-up set, 4 sets of lunges, the first set being another warm-up set, 4 sets of leg extensions, 4 sets of hamstring curls and finally 3 sets of deadlifts, which totals 20 sets for your thighs. Arnold clearly advocates the use and gradual progression of his recommended training programmes, that are aimed at beginner level right through to advanced. Now if you follow this as Arnold states, you will not end up doing 20 sets per bodypart until you reach the more advanced levels, which can sometimes take years of training to comfortably achieve.<br />Bodybuilding can be an extremely difficult and demanding sport depending on what level you are currently participating at. The use of behind the neck presses and behind the neck lat pulldowns etc. is questionable and have been proven to aggravate the shoulder complex but we have to take into consideration the fact that these are actually 'sport specific exercises' and like many other sports like karate which advocate ballistic stretching and athletics with explosive power movements such as heavy partial squats, they belong in the relam of the sports they were designed specifically for and not in recreational training programmes designed to reduce weight and improve tone. <br />The only downfall I see concerning the book is the sparsity oftext in the injuries section, which deserves much more attention. However, this book is excellent and belongs in your bodybuilding arsenal. It will provide you with inspiration, motivation  and the knowledge to help you succeed and I highly recommend that you purchase it.
0385505833|5.0|Grisham's &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; highlights the chaos of the holiday season in entertaining ways.  He focuses on the social obligations that have come to represent Christmas and paints believable and comic relationships between characters and their circumstances.  While the serious underlying message is there to enjoy, the last fifty pages were full of smiles and laughs.  Unpretentous and not over-drawn, this book deserves to be re-read and shared.
B0000025KI|3.0|THE RIVER features Springsteen at his best and his worst. Coming on the classic heels of BORN TO RUN and DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, Springsteen was bound for a letdown, but this record is quite a confusing hodgepodge.  The double set features some of Springsteen's finest songs, including &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;, the title cut, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, and the stunning &quot;Point Blank&quot;. There are numerous other serviceable tracks across a wide variety of musical stlyes (including the irresistable &quot;Sherry Darling&quot;).  Unfortunately, this album also begins two trends that Springsteen has carried with him ever since this release: droning, socially-aware dirges (carried to fuller fruition on NEBRASKA), and generic rockers with little to no melody to speak of.  It's disheartening to compare the melodic joy in older songs like &quot;Rosalita&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, and compare it to drab, tuneless rockers on this album, such as &quot;Ramrod&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;. This album also contains &quot;You Can Look, But You Better Not Touch&quot;, perhaps the worst song in the Springsteen catalog, as well as the horrifically overwrought ballad &quot;Drive All Night&quot;.  There is enough good, and occasionally great, stuff here to warrant a recommendation, but THE RIVER also foreshadows the bland, repetitious nature of Springsteen's music over the last two decades.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle.  To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it.  And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that \\"Will live in infamy.\\"<br /> Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event.  And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement.  This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with \\"Titanic,\\" there's no better way to do it than with a love story.<br /> Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished.  Like Cameron (and many othersbefore him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective.  By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective.  And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.<br /> Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like \\"Bombardier,\\" \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\\" and \\"The Bridges At Toko-Ri,\\" than the more recent \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (though it does have \\"Ryan's\\" same level of realism).  It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.<br /> Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story.  She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story.  If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, \\"over-reaction\\") to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.<br /> Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty.  Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else.  In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.<br /> The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha).  One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical \\"accuracy\\" of the film, but without question, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable.  It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered.
0786112581|4.0|marginalized &amp; denied by the perpetrators. Most people are aware of  &quot;the rape&quot;. It gets a paragraph in most history books. I    thank Iris Chang for adding a major mainstream book on the subject. It can only add to the pressure on Japan to confront this stain on their national reputation. Ms Chang's story is a chapter in the much larger war of annihilation waged by Japan against the people of China. This war made hardened Nazi recoil in horror. Ms Chang recounts the days before, how could it have been prevented &amp; the absymal condition of the Chinese army unable or unwilling to put up even token opposition despite superior numbers. After a while her blizzard of numbers becomes to much: number of rapes, numbers of murders, combinations, numbers of torture, those used for bayonet practice etc. They  become meaniless. Her suggestion that Japan pay reparations (such as The United States did to its Japanese citizens intered in World War II) is unrealistic. More real is an official apology from the Japanese government. Maybe when every Japanese soldier form World War II &amp; their next of kin are dead will that apology come.
B00003CXRM|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I didn't even realize it was a satire.  I guess the name &quot;ULYSSES Everett McGill&quot; didn't sink in.  It didn't matter.  I've seen some good movies and a whole lot of bad ones, and this was one of the absolute best!  The dialogue is terrific, the soundtrack is a real blast from the past, and even George Clooney had a believable accent!  Speaking of Clooney, his character is absolutely hilarious!  I really don't know how to put it into words and still do it justice, so watch the movie and see for yourself!
0375703764|5.0|What is this book, anyway? Something like a strange hybrid of a horror thriller and a post-modern literary mosaic. Some people have come away from this book finding it cluttered, pretentious and pointless, but I had the opposite feeling: that I was reading genius. At few points in the &quot;narrative&quot; does this book begin to bore; usually, it holds the reader's attention with its clever textual apparatus, multiple narrators and commentators, mock-intellectual discourse, not to mention the actual subject matter: a house whose secrets are, apparently, too horrific to divulge in full. I am not an expert on experimental fiction of this type and I don't know how much Danielewski is indebted to his forerunners (some reviewers have accused him of liberal borrowing). Undoubtebly, though, the best book I've read in the past year.
6304493681|4.0|Believe the hype! \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" ranks up there with the best Anime films out there. Sort of an action-drama, the story revolves around bionic humans who have human interaction, and feelings, but are synthetic. A hacker known as the \\"puppet master\\" is hacking into the \\"shell\\" of the cyborgs. The cyborgs begin to feel as though they are human and contemplate their own existence. The story get's more complex through many great action and dramatic sequences. The animation is beautiful, and the plot is smart.  \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is one of the finest achievements in Anime. The film has style and worth. It's a film that can be enjoyed more with every viewing. \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is a landmark film. Believe the hype!
B00001ODHJ|4.0|I know it's tempting, but don't do it!!  The regular editions ending is soooooo much better than the one in the bootleg. I always found this one of the funniest parts of the whole movie. There are two great lines at the end of the movie: The monster in the store asks Ash who the hell he is, and he answers, like James Bond &quot;The Names Ash....Housewares.&quot; He then proceeds to shoot the heebiegeebies out of the monster, and the other line I won't ruin. I find this to be the best of the Evil Dead Trilogy, but the second one is not far behind. The regular edition DVD is awesome, and the bootleg just screws it up. Buy the regular, it's worth the extra 5 bucks.
B00003CXBK|3.0|This extremely popular Anime film about a young man's journey to find the nature god to cure his demonic arm is an epic in scope, but marred by problems. When this film was released in the U.S. it was chocked full Hollywood names for the voice-overs, and distributed by Miramax Studios. It was celebrated by critics and loved by audiences....and \\"Princess Mononoke\\" isn't a bad film. I don't see how it became so popular in Japan though. It's PG-13 rating gives it away that it's strictly for profit and not for art. For having that rating it pushed the envelope as close as it could, which is a plus. The film, however, was marred by over length. The film wasn't bad, the story was rather interesting at times, it had two stories going on at once. It did slow down near the end, it could have been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, and I'm not exaggerating. Besides the conclusion the film is pretty well done, the animation is clean, the colors are lush. It's much brighter than most Anime, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it works well with the film. Overall \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is grand in scale and names, but does fall short when compared to classic medieval Anime films such as \\"Ninja Scroll.\\"
B00005OM4Q|5.0|The bootleg cut makes this film much better, and it is now my prefered way to watch it. The extra 30 minutes add alot to the film in terms of character relationships and storyline. Also, there is a hilarious scene involving the band being interviewed by a pothead DJ. Kate Hudson steals the film, She is innocent, charming, and kind of quirky all at the same time. She is one of the best actesses around, and it's a shame she doesn't get more work. Jason Lee is a great supporting role, and I am not saying that because he's one of the greatest actors of all time. Cameron Crowe directs it wonderfully. The Bootleg cut is the only way to watch it though, the &quot;Untitled&quot; version, so to say. Get it. NOW.
6305014140|4.0|Every once in a while I find myself drawn to a film, that for some odd reason, I like! \\"Ninja Scroll\\" is a prime example. When it comes to Anime, I'm almost as critical as film itself. I look for a good story, good animation, good directing, good dialogue, and even good violence! Such films as \\"Perfect Blue\\" and \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" blend all of these things together and form classic Anime. However \\"Ninja Scroll\\" neatly fits in with these films, but may not have all the attributes I prefer. The film has unbelievable action sequences, but for the most part that's it. Yet I'm drawn to this film, as if it had a good, detailed story, and good dialogue. The animation is top of the line, and the films runs smooth. The story is viable, but the main character, Jubei, is relentless when it comes to his foes, not including his just a plain bad (...)! The film contains explicit sexual situations, which I could do without, but it doesn't take anything away from the film itself. Overall \\"Ninja Scroll\\" may not have had the makings for a classic Anime film when it started production, but the finished product is the \\"Die Hard\\" of Anime films. Just good old (...) kicking entertainment.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I don't like musicals. I am notorious for hating all of them. Movies where characters just burst into song at any time just bugs me. So I didn't seem like the type who'd like Moulin Rouge, so I left it alone. The music video supported my theory (You know, the one where Christina Aguilera looks like the Frankenstein monster). But every one gave it such rave reviews, and I had a Hollywood Video Gift Card, so I rented it on DVD. I have to say I was very pleasently surprised. The movie used songs that Had already been done before, so you already knew the words. The characters sang at the right times, and there was enough humor in it to keep me in stitches for most of it. It had a brilliant, tragic finale and amzing characters, and the actors sang very well (Nicole Kidman should Take Christina Aguilaera's job.) Do yourself a favor and rent this, and if you've already seen it the features will keep you entertained for an afternoon.
B00005MAM2|4.0|?Akira? is considered by most to be the masterpiece of Anime films. Made in 1988 it is a landmark film, both by the many great animated sequences and the detailed story. The film is rather graphic, but not many Anime films aren?t. While the film is groundbreaking for both animation and film, it is marred by over length. The animation to me, seems a little more ?cartoonish,? than films such as ?Perfect Blue? or ?Ghost in the Shell.? In a way it really doesn?t hurt it, since the film acts as a very eccentric, exaggerated science fiction film. Also the film was made in 1988, the 80s where a much different time than the 90s. Since then the animation has matured, and things are looking more realistic. But without classic 80s Anime films such as &quot;Akira,&quot; &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; and &quot;Wicked City,&quot; the Anime industry may be lost.
0152465030|5.0|I hope if you are reading this, that it means you have already heard of or read this delightful book. It is lovely and by no means just a children's book. I have learned,though, that there is now a second translation of this story. The first translation was by Katherine Woods, and in my opinion it is superior to the more recent translation by Richard Howard. Woods captures the feel and character of the prince and narrator far better than Howard's, whose translation seems merely an attempt to make money by retranslating a classic. I seriously recommend you read and buy the Woods translation rather than the most recent.
6305648522|5.0|Since I watched the movie in TV 10 years ago, I tried my best to collect the LD, DVD, soundtrack CD and the newly released director's cut. Everytime I watched it again, I was moved by the story and the meaning behind it.<br />Good for anyone with deep feeling of love and care for people around.
0156012197|2.0|The Little Prince is of course a delightful and meaningful book. I, however, am not fond of this translation by Richard Howard. At a glance, this and the earlier translation by Katherine Woods seem similar enough, but if you have seiously read and fallen in love with the Woods translation you can detect the ways in which the newer translation lacks in portraying the characters' personalities, and the story. The new translation just sounds like someone trying to make money off of an old classic without worrying about copywrite infringement. I seriously and desperately recommend you purchase the Woods translation if you can find it.
B000002GY9|5.0|How much do I love this recording? Well, let's go back to the 70's. There was always someone at a party who would troll through the hosts' record collection and select some atmosphere killing LP by Steely Dan, or Zappa, or Todd Rundgren, and, get this, they'd want you to love it too.I always left for the kitchen when this happened, but one party I guess I was a little slow afoot and I got hooked into hearing a couple of cuts from this wonderful album.So I went out and got it for myself. The first and last time a party troll ever influenced any record purchase of mine. On this ,Tom's fourth release, he completely succeeds in melding the Barfly-Bukowsky-Boho-meets The Beats influences into a cohesive and focused (if a barfly's eyes can focus)piece of work that is unmistakably Tom's own. It's hilarious (The Piano Has Been Drinking), sentimental in a good way (Tom Traubert's Blues, a song so good even disco era Rod Stewart couldn't ruin it)and hip,or hep as the case may be (Step Right Up). Everything on here is wonderful and the small authentic bopster/cool combo headed by L.A. jazz drummer Shelly Manne keeps everything swinging madly.Tom Waits is by no means an idiot and he realized he couldn't keep going to this same well.He handed the keys to his Caddy to Rickie Lee Jones and set out to make &quot;serious&quot; music that certain of my egghead friends assure me is a wonderful mix of Kurt Weill, musique concrete and a whole bunch of modern classical composers.Hmm...okay. Me, I'd rather be rained on with my own .38 .So I'll stick to old fashioned Tom Waits straight up with a twist. That's how much I love this record.

B00000099Y|5.0|While this isnt my favorite TooL cd, it is still amazing music. Out of all of their music, this cd is still full of Maynard's great lyrical symphony. Whether the song is Stinkfist,H, or 46&amp;2, this cd is a must for any tool fan. The songs come straight from the band's hearts, making you lose yourself in their masterful lyrics. Their guitar riffs are amazing, the bass lines are great, and Maynard's voice is the best in the music industry today. Buy this cd, it is worth the money!
B00003CXV4|3.0|A good movie to see if you are in the mood for an entertaining, light humoured romance.<br />This movie lacks depth, however, and failed to enspire me to the point of whishing that I was actually alive in it and part of the characters' lives.<br />Reeves plays the role of a highly successful advertizing executive riding the wave of success - unfortunately, to the detriment of his tolerance for others on a lower level than himself, or moving slower than his self-imposed hyperfast pace of life. He has no time for those unable to keep up...<br />Until Sara (Charlize Theron) enters his life. She is an unassuming, full of life person, who manages to see the good in life, and wants to show it to others. Hence her romantic overtures towards Nelson.<br />At first, he wants to know nothing about her, but gradually, using clever wit, she manages to draw him into her life, and promises him a month that will change his life, in return.<br />What follows is a good, but somewhat blaze, story of two people in love. Nothing new there - even Sara's terminal sickness could have been predicted.<br />What is a bit outrageous, and mind-jarring, is Nelson's sudden about turn from selfish, rude high-flyer, to people loving, domesticated, kind-hearted father figure. Plaudible as it may be, we know that life does not quite work that way, or at least not so quick or easy . . .<br />Also, the ending was a bit melodramatic, and leaves the whole tale hanging in the air - one almost expects to see the words &quot;To be continued&quot; appearing on the screen (or perhaps whish that it would?).<br />This is a difficult movie to voice an absolute opinion about - at once it is good entertainment, but at some times lacks the sparkle one would expect from actors of this stature.<br />Compliments, though, to Charlize for the way she managed to portray what it should be like to love life, in all its exhuberant beauty and intensity.
B000007MVM|4.0|This is a confession of man in decay, this record is like a diary or story. This is a great strange album. Buy it. And laugh with him, maybe for the last time.
B00005QDW1|1.0|There's a lot of debate about weather this is a good album or not, with the change in style and all. Personally I'm glad that to see No Doubt is continuing their fine tradition of making each album significantly different than the last, even if I don't like it as much as any of the others.<br />What I'd like to mention is that this CD incorporates copy-protection that for the time being prevents the tracks from being ripped from the CD on a computer. This 'protection' also prevents the tracks from even being played on a computer, and some DVD players (I was only able to get the CD to play on a dedicated stereo or car CD player). I find the fact that it can't be played on a computer particuarly ludicrous considering the 'enhanced CD' features which can ONLY be used on a computer that are included (which by the way work fine, and are a lack-luster screen-saver and the video to Hey Baby). So send a message to the powers that be and don't buy this CD.
B00002E23E|4.0|I love this movie, but I do sometimes hate live concerts, cause they change the tone on which the songs are usually performed, and I can't follow the song. But this is a cool movie, and the John Bonham 10 minute drum solo is Fu**ing great.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This was by far and away one of the most hyped movies among teenagers.  I recently saw this movie and must say it is by far one of the worst movies ever.  The acting in this film is terrible.  There are seldom any emotions behind any characters.  An example of the poor excuse for drama comes in lines like, &quot;I've seen you drive, you got a heavy foot.... you'll blow yourself to pieces.&quot;  Who are these actors kidding?  Not only was the acting terrible, the plot was second rate and there were countless inaccuracies with the movie.  It is suppose to represent the &quot;Street Racing&quot; scene and fails to do so.  All the cars are extremely flashing with their decals, the only car with decals I see are on cars with a new set of wheels and maybe and exhaust tip.  Not only are there inaccuracies in the cars (a twin turbo supra with nitrous oxide?  Anyone knows the engine would have severe detonation and probably break down) but also the people in the scene as well.  You never see gangs of different ethnic races at car shows such as this movie.  All in all, this was a terrible movie, only liked by the ignorant youth who are excited by high pitched engine revs.

0451204530|3.0|This suspense novel, set in the late 1950's, is driven by a plan to sabotage the first American satellite launch. The principal characters have backgrounds in the OSS of World War Two. Beginning his story with a man suffering from amnesia, Follett works through the plot in a reliably workmanlike way, but without much flair. The purported consequences of a launch failure seem wildly exaggerated; failures were common in the early days of the space program, but did not cause the U.S. to give up on competing with the Soviet Union. Making the most heroic women members of minority groups while the villainess is from the white upper class smacks of modern day political correctness. Did American men of the 1950's really wear Chinos and say &quot;whatever?&quot;
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Angelina Joilie is the perfect Lara Croft -every bit of the game and more. Great action, great acting, all her own stunts as the DVD version points out with behind the scences training, interviews, making of the movie, and 3 missing scenes. Some of the sets were a liitle too much &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, but Angelina's understated character, kick-ass action scenes, and beautiful looks makes this the best action adventure movie in my mind. A chick pulling off all the incredible stunts and fight scenes somehow looks more real than any guy. A better than the Indiana Jones series -more camp and classic like &quot;Mad Max.&quot;  Can't wait for Tomb Raider 2!
B00003CXB4|4.0|I have never watched an animation and cried in the opening titles, unltil the lion king.<br />Suitable for adults and children ,I believe this is one of the best productions ever achieved by a animation company.<br />They have been absolutely criminal by not releasing this film earlier(should I say ,ever) on DVD .booo hisss to disney!!<br />regards all<br />If you ever get to see it<br />If you can find it<br />I garantee it will bring a tear to your eye..even me.
B000051S44|4.0|For the true race car enthusiast, LeMans, after more than 30 years remains the most realistic racing movie ever made. Steve McQueen was a true sports car enthusiast and a racer himself, and he hired director John Frankenheimer to film him (Steve) in the world's most important sports car race -The 24 Hours of LeMans. Real factory race cars from Porsche and Ferrari were used to make the movie, and cameras were mounted in the cars during the race for much of the movie footage. The action was real, the crowds, the location.<br />The only thing lacking was a story, an afterthought hastily written after the movie was halfway through production. But still, much better than the scripts in more recent films like &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Driven&quot; where we are led to believe an inexperienced rookie (Tom Cruise) and a washed-up has been (Sly Stalone) can roll onto a race track without practice, break the track records, stick quarters to their tires at 160 mph, start CART race cars without starters and race through downtown Chicago at night without lights  and not draw the attention of police, and then go out and beat the established champs in the race the next day.<br />Another old movie like LeMans, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; with James Garner was good. Real tracks like Monaco, real drivers in the background scenes, but the cars were mocked-up Formula 3 cars -not Formula 1, and you could tell. Get LeMans, and get Steve McQueen's &quot;Bullet&quot; for the epic streets of San Frabncisco car chase scene, one of the best chase scene ever (now only recently relegated to 2nd place by the chase scene in &quot;Ronan&quot;).
B00005AACC|1.0|MI2 is a piece of garbage. Even watching it with your brain turned off, you cant enjoy this lame &quot;action&quot; movie, where TOm Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunts character forever, where the bad guy is a joke, where theres no chemistry between Cruise and the female main character, where the action sequence are all in slow motion; where the face-mask device is repeated thousand times; whre everything smells &quot;money!!&quot;. This is the lowest point in Cruises career, but apparently he did it for the doubtful pleasure of working with &quot;genius&quot; director John Woo...
B00003CXTG|4.0|I went into the theater to see this film fully aware that the majority of the film focused on romance, not the Pearl Harbor attack.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a LOT more action than I expected.  The sequence where Rafe is fighting in England as part of the Eagle Squadron is a very well done depiction of the desperate struggles of the RAF against the Luftwaffe.  This sequence is an overlooked high spot in the film.  I was also very happy with the sequence regarding the training for the Doolittle Raid and the raid itself.  As for the romantic triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsdale, well, it was pretty predictable, but it did do a great job of making us care about them and their friends.  Ironically, the character I enjoyed the most, Cuba Gooding Jr., was almost totally ignored.  I thought the film missed an opportunity by not spending more time on him and his friend who was killed aboard USS Arizona.  <br />Having said all this, I did have a few problems with the depiction of the actual attack itself.  Mostly, though, they are things that I wish they would have shown but didn't, since I am a WW2 buff and am very familiar with the actual events.  I have to wonder, though, why they showed such excellent imagery of the USS Oklahoma capsizing and the explosion of USS Arizona, but left in all the modern warships that are seen throughout the attack.  There were also a lot of bits, especially the toppling mainmast of a battleship, that were not historically accurate, but seemed thrown in just to provide a few more explosions.  I also think the film missed an opportunity by not showing the attempt by USS Nevada to escape the harbor, and her subsequent attacking and beaching.  That would have been a great action sequence and a stirring moment, much as the actual event was.<br />Perhaps the movie's strongest scenes were the ones dealing with the responses of medical personnel to the flood of injured victims and the attempts to save trapped and drowning sailors.  Using Coke bottles to collect donated blood, use of lipstick to identify those who could and could not be saved, the general chaos, the helplesness of rescuers as their comrades drown before their very eyes - very powerful stuff. <br />I thought this movie was a great action/romance, if not strictly true to history.  But, for those of us who insist on historical fidelity, there is always Tora, Tora, Tora!
B00003CXTF|1.0|This is nothing, just another Bruckenheimer commercial attempt to blockbuster, copying avery cliche imaginable. It has the greates actual wooden actor, Ben Affleck. It has a stupid and unconvincing love triangle the leads nowhere. Well, Im out of words, how can millions and millions of dollars be spent in such a waste of time, such a heartless movie, where the soundtrack tries hard to put &quot;emotion&quot; where theres none!!
B00005JKES|4.0|For all of you who have bashed Artisan for releasing the first season of Twin Peaks without the pilot, bear in mind that they tried to get the rights for it, but Warner Bros./Paramount wouldn't let go of it.  Most of you should know by now that a limited-release DVD of the pilot with the original television ending was recently made available in Taiwan by a company called Catalyst Logic.  Some thought it was a bootleg, but that appears not to be the case.<br />Up until now, we have had to go to eBay and a bunch of alternative, back-alley dealers to pick up the Taiwanese pilot.  Now, Amazon is also making it available.  So to all of those people loudly complaining that they can't find the pilot, here's a chance to get it while you can.  It might not be around for long!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I saw this lame movie last night and was blown away by how weak it was.  The lines were so trite that I actually felt embarrassed for everyone who was involved in this film.  It was so &quot;Hollywood&quot;.   There was never a moment in the movie when I was not acutely aware of the fact that it was an over-inflated production.  In other words, I never lost myself in the story.  Also, I thought the attack scenes were awful.  I mean, jeeze, whenever a plane was fired upon, the cockpit always exploded.  The cockpit!?   That would not happen.  The fuel tanks are in the wings, not the cockpit.  How stupid!!!!!!!!!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I rented this and couldn't finish watching it. I love movies, even bad ones. But this was just an afront to my senses. And I couldnt have cared less if the characters lived or died. Need I say more. I watched this with a female friend and she felt the same way. Who is writing all of the good reviews for this film, the studio?
B000003TAW|5.0|Say what you will about Weezer. But don't say it until you've listened to the cd once or twice. Talk to people who have the cd. And if you've only heard &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; or &quot;Island in the SUn&quot; (both from the green album) then don't base your opinion of Weezer on it--though those are good songs, Weezer has stuff that's a million times better, and it's on the Blue Album. Each song is so full of emotion (a wide range of them) and all the lyrics are so smart. I bought this cd because I'd downloaded &quot;Say it ain't so&quot; and really loved it. On first listen of the cd, I wasn't sure I would even like it. Now I can't stop listening to it. It's the best money I've ever spent. It gets me every time--every song makes you feel something, and all of them have such wonderful melodies. They're catchy enough to be pop, but they have that special edge and intelligence which makes them Weezer. Weezer gets put into a lot of categories. But really, I think Weezer is it's own genre. Weezer is Weezer. It's emotional, thoughtful rock that is  alive and flavorful.
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's &quot;Dummy&quot; is a masterpiece.  Their self-titled follow-up is also very good, but nothing can touch Dummy.  Dummy is dark, a bit rough around the edges, and very inviting.  Read the other reviews to get an idea of their sound.  I'll say right now that just like classical art masterpieces, this album isn't for everyone.  If you absolutely can't stand trip-hop, you probably won't enjoy Dummy.  Give a track a listen, though, and I can almost guarantee you will want this album.
B00005QCYC|5.0|Well, without going into the plots of all 3 movies, which I'm sure everybody already knows, I'll give a brief run-down of what's all included in this box set.<br />First of all, you get all 3 movies and tons of DVD extras with each regular disc.  You get stuff like the &quot;Making of's&quot; and &quot;How'd they do that&quot; along with numerous stills of models and story boards.  But what's most interesting is that even if you found that one or more of these movies weren't up to par with one or more of the other ones, then watch the special features of each film and you'll get a greater appreciation of each film.  Actually the dinosaurs in JP:III were probably the most sophisticated in all of the films.  One of my favorite NEW dinos in JP:III was the Velociraptor.  New, you ask?  Yes, new.  Why?  Because if you really pay attention to them in the film and in the extras, you really see that they have been totally redone for this film in not only appearance, but also in intelligence.<br />Also the 4th disc has additional extras for each film that aren't included on the regular discs.  Some of the footage is duplicated, but not much.  Did you know that the cliff scene in Lost World was shot along the side of a high-rise parking garage on the lot of Universal Studios?  Did you know that a lot of the dino scenes in all 3 movies had both CGI dinos and real animatronic dinos?  I dare you to tell the difference.<br />If you liked this series at all, I highly recommend this set for your DVD collection.  It ranks right up there with the Die Hard Ultimate Edition and Alien Legacy boxed sets.
B000001ELP|3.0|This album, in the words of Paul Stanley, was &quot;a left turn down a very dark street for us&quot;.  Paul may be correct but musically it is probably Kiss' most interesting album ever...and they needed something different after the disco of &quot;Dynasty&quot; and the '80s proto-pop of &quot;Unmasked&quot;...this album was very poorly received by fans but at least it primed the band to do &quot;Creatures Of The Night&quot; which I rate as the best and heaviest Kiss album ever.<br />A lot of rumour and innuendo surrounds this album, especially as to just WHO is on it, particularly Ace.  From information I have been able to glean from Gene Simmons' recent &quot;Kiss and Make-Up&quot; book, as well as late-'80s interviews with Ace Frehley, I can draw the following conclusions:<br />1. Ace is probably only on his composition &quot;Dark Night&quot; (one of the album's heaviest and best tracks).  There was much conflict between Ace and the rest of the band during this period.  Ace said in the late '80s that he &quot;doesn't remember&quot; if he was on the album or not, due to his increasing alcohol and drug problems.  However, the band appeared on &quot;Solid Gold&quot; in early 1982 miming to &quot;I&quot; and playing the video for &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;.  Ace was there, though in &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot; he is shown playing acoustic guitar with Paul playing the lead.  He also did not appear when the band played at Studio 54 for European television - this is the only time the band played as a trio.<br />2. Ace said in Kerrang! magazine in 1985 that Bob Ezrin erased most of his work on the album.<br />3. Eric Carr does not play drums on &quot;I&quot;.<br />4. Much of the album's disjointed nature has to do with the fact that Bob Ezrin was suffering his own substance problems at the time.<br />However, musically it is indeed fine.  One would find &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Just A Boy&quot; hard to associate with Kiss, but &quot;The Oath&quot;, &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Dark Light&quot; are indeed heavy Kiss tracks.<br />As to the story, it is nearly impossible to follow based on the lyrics and liner notes.  It would be nice if this were at least explained in future.<br />Don't get this album as an introduction to Kiss (get &quot;Alive!&quot; or &quot;Creatures...&quot; for that) but get it if you're up for something different more in the mould of Queen or Kansas than standard Kiss.
B00004Z459|5.0|I first heard &quot;Crawling&quot; on MTV and immediately I was hooked. One day I was in the CD store and I decided to take a chance and buy the whole album. I'm glad I did. This album easily became my favorite of the summer. Before &quot;In the End&quot; was released as a single, I knew that it was a great song and was/is my favorite song of the album. All the songs (sans #4, I ususally skip over that song) are well written and well produced. It's one of the few albums that I can sit and listen to from beginning to end. Congrats to LP for their grammy nominations!
0679735259|1.0|The problem with writers is that they are writers.  As such they are basically dishonest.  This is not Vietnam as told by a soldier.  This is Vietnam as told by a piece of garbage journalist who is &quot;in-country&quot; to the precise extent he cares to be and hotfoots it out of there when the going gets rough.  In the beginning of the book Herr describes the horrors of night patrol by describing his own abject fear.  He then informs the bewildered reader that this is a bit too much for him and he's gonna take his journalistic eye somewhere else.  The difference between a journalist and a soldier is that the soldier can't leave when he feels like it and so he doesn't have the luxury of drama.  Drama is the luxury of the insincere.  And this book is drama.  Readers interested in reality rather than cranked-up journalistic dramatics would do better to read Vietnam memoirs by actual soldiers, which are in good supply and are usually written in a matter-of-fact way.
0789723107|4.0|I just finished reading the book November 2001...over a year since it was printed, and probably a good two years since the author started writing the book. At that time (2 years back), web interface was like the Wild West...few conventions with a lot of experimentation going on. However, fast-forward to the present time and there's hardly anything new or fresh to his book because what he was preaching then is by now web convention. It's almost a template to any corporate website. This is by no means a discredit to the author...only to the fact that I read his book at a much later time. Since most of what he was saying then is by now convention only proves that he knows what he's talking about.<br />What I found useful was his treatment of visual hierarchy. At a glance, the first time visitor should be able to make sense of what the site is all about, what it can do for him and where to start. It's not only having the essential components (site id, tagline, welcome blurb, sections, etc.) but also knowing the proper treatment to these components.<br />Another useful idea was doing usability tests on the cheap, doing a series of tests with fewer people than 1 big test with lots of people.<br />For veteran and new web designers embarking on a new project, this remains a good refresher book. But if you want to leverage the current web literacy of users out there, a more current book that expounds on emerging usability issues might be a better choice.
0960191038|5.0|The Pyramid Principle is one of the few books that I have read that has fundamental changed the way I work.  The concepts in the book can fundamentally change the way you communicate and think through issues and present ideas.  This book and its concepts literaly turns everything you know about writing upside down.<br />Interestingly enough, the book is not particularly well written and can be difficult to grasp. <br />I strongly advise that, if possible, you find someone who practices Minto as a mentor to help you apply the content and concepts in the book.  You will learn it better when you have someone tear down your work (using minto principles) in order to build a stronger communication.<br />Here are some of the key ideas in the book to help you structure your thinking and communications.<br />1)What is the situation ?  A statement that the audience agrees exists and will immediately recognize.<br />2) What is the complication?  The event or condition that renders the situation no longer tenable or in other words &quot;why the status quo will no longer stand&quot;<br />3) The R1 describes what we have now.  This helps set the scope of the arguement<br />4) The R2 descibes the world as it should be.  This sets the scope of the solution.<br />Good luck with the ideas in the book.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|While I enjoy the visual virtuousity of Lasseter et. al. at Pixar and ignoring the horribly off-target AntZ -- DreamWorks succeeds with a picture combining the best of computer imagery and the best traditions of intelligent cartooning.  Shrek plays perfectly to the 10 and under-- but can only be savored fully with the adult understanding of inside and over-the-head-of-the-youngsters jokes.<br />Wonderful
6300184269|5.0|I will say that this will always be one of my favorite movies of the 80s.  Along with the other John Hughes films, of course.  But, what ever happened to the original ending with the Rocky theme?  Even the copy I own has the alternate ending with the oingo boingo title track x2.  This is my only problem with the new vhs/tv version.  It just bugs me when films are edited when they're re-released.  What's the point?
B00005O5CM|2.0|Hoping to find some new material in this movie, I was greatly disappointed. This is a retread of old ideas, about becoming, about dumb blonde jokes, about spoiled rich kid jokes, about nothing we haven't seen already a dozen times already. There were only two genuinely funny moments, other than that, it was time I'll never get back.
6300183211|4.0|Given the high-power talent behind the camera (Brian DePalma), in front of it (Al Pacino), and at the typewriter (Oliver Stone), SCARFACE should have quite a lot going for it.  It does indeed, although I can't quite call this a GODFATHER-type masterpiece for certain reasons.<br />Ostensibly, this is a reworking of Howard Hawks' classic 1932 gangster pic about Al Capone.  This time, the setting is Miami circa 1980, the contraband in question is cocaine, and the lead character, Pacino's Tony Montana, is a Cuban-born criminal who just came off the Mariel boat lift with 125,000 others that Castro let go, twenty percent of whom were known criminals.  Pacino gets in on the ground floor with a local drug boss (Robert Loggia) and soon works his way to the top, doing just about everything to tick someone off--associates, enemies, cops, his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer), his sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), and the Colombian drug kingpins he has to do business with.<br />But in his cocaine-fueled journey to achieve the so-called American Dream, he neglects to follow two rules taught to him by Loggia: (1) Don't underestimate the other guy's greed; and (2) Don't get high on your own supply.  He finally crosses the line in the end by alienating a Colombian drug boss (Paul Shenar) so much that Shenar sends assassins to Pacino's Miami villa.  The result is a horrific and bloody shootout in which most of the assassins are rubbed out, and so is Pacino.<br />Without a doubt, SCARFACE continues to generate wildly divergent opinions, both pro and con.  I for one had some trouble trying to stomach Pacino's Cuban accent at first, but then his ultra-charistmatic performance kicked into high gear, four-letter words and all.  The film is very true to its essentials of showing how a certain segment of the Cuban boat people, a very SMALL segment, tried to latch onto the American Dream by trafficking in illegal narcotics and thus earning millions.  Probably the most interesting thing about SCARFACE is the political view that Stone espouses in his screenplay: he seems to espouse a very Reaganesque view of the world of the 1980s (virulent anti-Communism; anti-Castro), but in truth he is severely critical of those very same policies that motivated Castro to send the worst of his worst onto American soil and thus accelerate this nation's drug problem.<br />SCARFACE does have its faults.  It requires a lot of patience to sit through with a running time approaching 170 minutes, and I am not all that sure there is enough in there to sustain it for that kind of length.  The film continues to be controversial in some quarters for its extreme (as opposed to merely excessive) violence; the chainsaw scene in an apartment, the hanging from a helicopter, and the ultra-gory shootout at the end rank as some of the most violent scenes ever shown on film.  Only four other films in history challenge it in this respect: THE WILD BUNCH, SOLDIER BLUE, TAXI DRIVER, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Finally, this film set a record for the greatest number of times the &quot;F&quot; word, or variations of it, are used; I lost count at two hundred.  This IS a bit much, although it probably fits the reality of the situation it depicts.<br />On the other hand, DePalma, whose 1976 film CARRIE remains one of the touchstone suspense/horror films of all times, does make quite a lot out of Stone's wild and crazy screenplay--though surprisingly, for the violent scenes, he doesn't use slow-motion or montage that much, which would have earned him favorable comparisons with the legendary Sam Peckinpah.  Just as solid is the camera work of John Alonzo, who worked on CHINATOWN and BLACK SUNDAY, among others.  Giorgio Moroder's score is pretty good, though I do admit it gets a little cheesy after a while.  And Pacino's performance is also high-caliber; just get used to his Cuban accent, and it works very well.<br />This film comes highly recommended, but with this warning: It is definitely NOT for younger audiences, it is rated 'R' for a lot of good reasons.
B00005O892|1.0|Where to begin?<BR>OK.<BR>Why in Heaven's name would the producers go through all the effort to digitally recreate &quot;Battleship Row&quot; and waves upon waves of attacking Japanese aircraft, only to show a US NAVY NIMITZ Class nuclear carrier in another scene, and try to palm it off as a Japanese carrier? And the footage of the TICONDEROGA Class Guided Missile Cruisers (First commissioned in 1980), interspersed with the WWII battleships getting blown up, was another anachronistically lovely touch as well.<BR>Add to this a sophomoric love triangle to titillate the pre-pubescent girls (and some of their mothers) in the audience, and pitch it all as a tribute to the fighting men of WWII, and you have the recipe for a totally overhyped, &quot;film that will live in infamy&quot;.<BR>The most enjoyable part of the tape, for me, was the &quot;History Channel&quot; program that followed the movie, and showed actual footage from 1941, and told the story of some of the unsung heroes of that day. It's a shame that the producers couldn't spare a few minutes from their three hour long tribute to &quot;Love Story&quot;, so rudely interrupted by a few obligatory battle scenes, to do justice to these brave men's story. <BR>Do yourself a favor and get the Widescreen version of &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; instead. No digital &quot;magic&quot;, but an infinitely better telling of the story of the &quot;date that will live in infamy&quot;. Sorry girls, no Ben Affleck either.<br />By the way, the passenger car outside Ben Affleck's train window, &quot;Silver Horizon&quot; was built for the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; in 1948, 7 years after Pearl Harbor. But that's being real picky, I know.
B00000F14B|5.0|The Music Man is one of my fav. musicals of all time...and I have to say that the movie version of this musical is very well made...The DVD itself is also helpful in learning about some of the big actors and actresses in the movie...I would really like to see if there's another production of The Music Man which can top this one...<br />This is a story about a thimble-riggin', cheatin' salesman Professor Harold Hill (Preston) who comes into Rivercity Iowa to try to sell the idea of startin' up a band in this small town and take their money and leave.  What he doesn't expect is that he bumps into Marian Paroo, the librarian (Jones) who stops at nothing to prove that he's a fake...They eventually fall in love, but with crazy Mayor Shinn trying to find out about the Professor, the School Board singing as a barber shop quartet, and a jealous salesman who has the proof that the Professor's a fake, this rollercoaster ride of a musical brings a lot of fun and excitement to it's audiences with such songs as \\"Till There Was You\\" [made famous by the Beetles], \\"Seventy Six Trombones\\", \\"Rock Island\\", and \\"Lida Rose\\"...

B00005JKQX|5.0|I was moved and fascinated by Russell Crowe's sensitive portrayal of John Nash as a brilliant mathematician plagued by the debilitating disease of schizophrenia. The story begins when Nash is at Princeton in the last 1940's pursuing his Ph.D. degree. He yearns to be important and have a breakthrough idea, but the interior world of his mind that he inhabits leaves him no time or desire for social interaction with others. He is intense, arrogant and competitive, and often not very likeable. He develops a ground-breaking equilibrium theory and receives the highest honors and an appointment to a government think-tank at MIT, where he earns a reputation as the best code breaker ever known. He is also supposed to teach a math class, which he occasionally remembers to do, and falls in love with one of his students, played by the beautiful, charismatic Jennifer Connelly.<br /><br />While at MIT he is approached by Parchman, a mysterious CIA operative, complete with black-hat and trench coat, played skillfully by Ed Harris. Parchman asks Nash to work with him on extracting codes imbedded in magazines and newspapers by the Russians who are hiding deadly nuclear bombs somewhere in the U.S. Nash becomes obsessed with this project to the exclusion of all his other work, and through this project his schizophrenia is finally revealed.<br /><br />The course of treatment for his mental disease is disturbing and tense. The audience is never certain what is in his mind and what is real. The brutal shock treatments and drug therapy leave him functioning like a zombie, and the ultimate irony of a brilliant mind flawed by mental disease is alarming. After a powerful episode where he has stopped taking his medications, and has threatened the lives of his wife and child, he finally admits his delusions and both he and his wife become committed to fighting the disease.<br /><br />It seems the best therapy, for Nash anyway, was to admit that some of the characters that inhabited his world were delusions, but to no longer allow them to control him. He returns to Princeton, and spends his days hanging around the library, working on his formulas and theories, and is eventually allowed to teach a class. The faculty and students accept him as an eccentric, harmless academic.<br /><br />Crowe displays an awesome range of acting skill in playing a brash, young student, a frenetic mad man, a humble supplicant, and eventually a doddering old oddball. The final feel-good scene where he accepts his Nobel Prize in Sweden could have felt like blatant audience manipulation, but instead felt like a well-earned tribute to Nash, the brilliant, but ultimately flawed mind and the beautiful relationship he had sustained with his loving, supportive wife.re delusions, but to no longer allow them to control him.

B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie was well made and is definitely worth buying.  It incorporates its talent wisely which really brings out the best in the movie.<BR>It lacked racing scenes, which I feel is the only real problem this film had.  The racing scenes that it did have did blow your mind and left you wanting more and more, but thats the trouble you have when you make a good action movie.  The viewers want more and more action scenes and could care less about the plot.<BR>The plot of the movie was a modified &quot;Into Deep&quot; story which in some situations more than others left something to desired, and even some points it really started to lack originality.<br />It is no &quot;Gone in 60 seconds&quot; but it is a keeper.
0385505833|5.0|This book was easy to read and was very interesting in detail and description.  The author made me feel like I knew exactly how the people felt and what was going on.

B00005RIKD|3.0|My main problem was walking into this without knowing that Sting was 'doing jazz'. Ignorance is bliss. I saw him perform &quot;Fragile&quot; on the Tribute for Heroes show and loved it. Dashed out  and got this CD asap. Love that song. But that's it. I am NOT a jazz fan. Most of these songs seem like an awkward fusion of gospel, jazz and whatever. Maybe I'm still too invested in Police versions....maybe I'm too old to be flexible. Bottom line is that there are only 2 songs I really liked here: Fragile and Every Breath You Take. Oh well.
B00003CXTG|1.0|What I am about to say will sound drastic, but I am not hyperbolizing when I assure you that \\"Pearl Harbor\\" may look pretty but is one of the worst films ever made. It is historically impoverished, offensively imbalanced, and egregiously derivative, borrowing spent and hackneyed motifs from one war film after another. This DVD presentation merely highlights the film's inadequacies, and I can't possibly warn you away from it vigorously enough.<br />First of all, history seems to have run a distant second to unbelievable drama in the making of this film, despite Bay's pretensions to the contrary. I have no problem with Bay when he makes shoot-'em-ups like 'The Rock' that take an incredible fictional scenario and turn it into a couple of hours of diversion. But here he's flagrantly tampering with the history of our nation, and he's done it a grave disservice. The best example of this problem in the film is the portrayal--or rather the lack thereof--of the Japanese preparations for the attack. Bay is far more interested in spinning out the implications of the rivalry between Hartnett and Affleck than in actually looking at how and why Pearl Harbor happened. This is especially frustrating when films like 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' have done this so much better.<br />This preoccupation with romance to the detriment of history is symptomatic on a much larger scale of movie-making that cares less about reality than it does about blowing stuff up and bedding the love interest (and thus perhaps it is also analogous to the way we Americans tend to take our place in the world in general, oblivious to what's really going on until it hits us over the head in a very shocking and tragic way). The Japanese are nowhere in this film, regardless of the little featurette Bay includes in this DVD purporting to offer 'the Japanese perspective.' We get a few nuggets of wisdom from Admiral Yamamoto, but can we really care in the filmic world Bay has created, where the Japanese are never really given any identity? One minute they're using subtitles, the next they're writing letters with English voice-overs. It's obvious that the film doesn't care about them, and thus we don't either. Again, other films have done this balance far better.<br />Finally, there's the annoying feeling that we've seen all of this before. The bullets through the water? Spielberg's \\"Private Ryan.\\" The undisciplined trainees in flight school at the outset? 'Top Gun,' anyone? The final bombing run (yeah, right)? Remember 'Memphis Belle'? Bay not only gives us stuff we've seen before, but he doesn't even do it as well or as coherently. And Randall Wallace, who turned out a wonderful screenplay for 'Braveheart,' can't make anything come together here. It's just a shame.<br />But it's not the worst shame. Beckinsale's final voice-over, as the camera pans the wreck of the USS Arizona, reminds us that 1,177 men--American soldiers--call the hull of that boat their final resting place. 1,177 men. And Michael Bay's film, with all of its convenient inaccuracies and forcibly misplaced triumphalism, is an affront to the memory of every single one of them.<br />And to those who cry, \\"Lighten up!  It's entertainment!\\", I have this to say: How many years will have to elapse before you will sit back, relax, and want to watch a lightened-up, entertaining movie about September 11th, 2001?  That's what I thought.  Historical tragedy that entertains is simply an offensive concept.  We deserve better, and so do the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is Pantera's best CD, hands down.  There is not one weak song on this album.  Every song has its amazing qualities that makes you think that the track you're on is the best song on the album.  Once you finish that song and listen to the next, you think that that track is the best song on the album.  It continues on like this until you finish the entire CD.  Everything after this album that Pantera released is a waste of time and money.  This is the one and only Pantera CD you must own.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Now... while some say that this movie can only be enjoyed by those whose wits have been dulled by watching MTV 24/7, i don't believe that to be true. I don't watch tv - i find very little meaningful content there.<br />This movie, however... is stunning.<BR>Absolutely stunning.<br />Its only flaw (that does not add to the movie) is how confusing it is for the first 10 minutes or so.<br />However, in all other ways, this movie is spectacular. The visuals are amazing, and, while the quick-cut editing and endless panning in and out makes some nauseous, i thoroughly enjoyed the craziness of the camera angles. And the set, costume, and makeup designs are beyond amazing... Original, playful, colorful, and flamboyant, they ritz up the movie even more and add to the endless eye candy. I work as a backstage technician, and i must say... the technical aspect of this movie is one great piece of work.<br />The movie also kept me amused with the redone pop classics such as Roxanne and Material Girl. The Roxanne Tango is absolutely amazing.<BR>And let me tell you... i hate pop music with a passion, but what a treat it was to see them redone.. well! They fit, in a playful, satirical way. Very nice.<br />I've also noticed that this is a movie you either absolutely love or absolutely hate, with little to no middle ground of noodling around with &quot;euh.... i don't know... it wasn't too bad?&quot;<BR>In my book, this only adds to the movie's score. I take those stats to mean that this is a very strong movie, so kudos to it.<br />In short... see this movie. If you aren't sure about buying it... RENT IT! Just give it a chance.
B0000584V3|5.0|Its a rare occurance days when a CD comes along that you can just put in the player, sit back, and enjoy. Blackwater Park is one of those CDs. It takes you on a musical and emotional journey that spans the loud darkness of death metal to the quiet sadness of acoustic rock. <br />You won't love this CD right away, but after hearing it once, there will be an urge to listen to it again, and again. <br />I was a little unsure about buying a 'death metal' CD, but I quickly realized that Opeth is so much more than death metal. Combine progressive metal with progressive rock with death metal with acoustic rock and you only have a glimpse of what Opeth is. I have never liked death metal singing/growling, but I have found myself not only tolerating it on this album, but accepting and enjoying it.<br />I am fan of progressive music of all kinds, and I consider Blackwater Park to be some of the finest progressive music I have ever listened to. Try it for yourself, and take the musical journey of Blackwater Park.
B000002IVF|3.0|If you ever listened to the Byrds Pre-Flyte album of demos that the Byrds made to get their original Columbia recording contract, you might remember a slow song by Crosby (one of his first recorded efforts) called &quot;The Airport Song.&quot; <br />On this album almost 30 years later the Croz returns to that lilting slow folk-melodic style. However, because 1000 Roads was recorded during the end of the synthesizer in pop music craze it has a lot of synthesizers backing him up. His voice actually changed little in 30 years.<br />The songs are, as the reviewers below state, uneven. I agree that &quot;Old Soldier&quot; is a standout track and would have held its own on any Byrds or CSN album if Croz had back then been old and wise enough to write it.<br />The title track Thousand Days is also excellent along with Hero and the second song about Croz racing cars as a kid.<br />Croz's previous album Yes I Can was a disappointment, and it made me think No He Cannot. But on Thousand Days He Could and Did.
B000002J1L|4.0|Genesis really came into their progressive rock own with Nursery Cryme.  The music and mood of the album has a spooky, mystical feel and Peter Gabriel really came into his own.  The album's opening track, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, is a stellar piece of music that extends over ten minutes, but doesn't lag.  &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; is another outstanding track that perfectly encapsules the prog-rock sound.  They misstep a bit on &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; and &quot;Harlequin&quot;, but overall, Nursery Cryme is a solid effort.
B000021YQV|5.0|The very first time I heard Chop Suey on the radio I loved it.  I have put off buying the CD because usually the whole album is not that good, and eventually you get tired of the radio hit.  But Chop Suey just keeps getting under my skin, so I finally bought the album.  Man I love it!  I listen to Creed, Godsmack, Disturbed, Rage Against the Machine, POD, and Aerosmith quite a lot.  I think this album is most similar in sound to some of Disturbed.  Although Creed will continue to be my favorite band, I am VERY impressed with SOAD.  I have listened to the disc over and over, and it just gets in your blood, and charges you up.  Just heard on the radio today they are coming to Austin.  Sign me up.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Mon dieu, a sad redux.  Willard is redefined as a prankster, is out looking for some tail, what the hell was Coppolla thinking? The original cut still is the best. <br />And there are few added features to this DVD, makes me suspect there will be a Platnium Edition to be released soon, sort of like what Cameron Crowe did with Almost Famous, a double disk with the Original/Director cut/and all the good added features.  Just rent this one if you are really curious.

0060930187|5.0|I happened to read The Bell Jar for my book group discussion for the month of December and instantly fell in love with the book. More than anything else I think it was Esther and her descriptions that absolutely gripped me from the very first word. <br />While reading the book, many times I tried to question my own sanity and what I was going through and quite surprisingly this book I felt dealt with so many issues that we all go through some or the other time in our lives. Esther's struggle with issues and people around her gave me an inkling into what was I facing with people around me. It's not more of madness than being sane that made me love this book and what it stands for - probably suffocation, probably the need to get away so many times when we are unable to do so. The probability of meeting someone nice and sensitive which never really works that way. <br />Grappling with oneself and situations can be quite a thing to undertake. Most of the times, many of us choose to push things under the rug without paying attention to our thoughts and problems. Esther on the other hand chooses to look inside and find answers which probably is best summed up in the following lines from the book, <br />&quot;How did I know that someday--at college, in Europe, somewhere, anywhere--the bell jar, with it's stifling distortions, wouldn't descend again?&quot;<br />This quote becomes all the more poignant when one discovers that only a month after The Bell Jar, her first novel, was published, Sylvia Plath took her own life. One wonders if things would have been different had she lived today. All in all The Bell Jar is one of the books in my life, which I will never let go...
B00000I0XW|5.0|Sarah Brightman and Andrew Lloyd Webber are no longer married to each other, but as I stated above, she's still happily married to his music.  I was raised during the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein era nd it took me time to grow to apprciate Webber's influence on musical drama.  Sarah Brightman's performances of Webber's music has been instrumental in my tastes maturing with the development of Broadway musical plays.  No matter how often I listen to them, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;All I Ask of You&quot;, &quot;Music of the Night&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry For Me, Argentina&quot;, &quot;Memory&quot;, all remain fresh while the less familiar works become more precious with repeat listening.  Also outstanding is the theme song Webber wrote for the Barcelona games and sung by Sarah and Jose Carreras, &quot;Amigos Por Siempre&quot;.  And don't overlook the devout rendition of &quot;Pie Jesus&quot;, a duet with Paul Miles-Kingston, from &quot;Requiem&quot;.  Other notable voices on the CD are: Michael Crawford, Cliff Richard, and Sir John Gielgud.<br />There are those who might not like this CD which is one of my favorites, but the only people I would advise not to buy this are those who just don't like the modern theater music as represented by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

0812550706|5.0|There is so much depth to Ender's Game that at times it can leave one stunned. It's my favorite book!  I can't think of a book that has affected me as greatly or made me think as much as this one.  If you're looking for a great book, and not all that long of a read, i would definitely recommend it.  When you're done read the rest of the series!  They're just as good, but in a different way. Happy Reading!
B00005U11Z|5.0|I have seen Journey several times and one of my favorite of many many bands I have seen since seeing Aerosmith as just a local band. I was waiting for a live performance recording for a long time. This is about as good as it gets in quality. Sure it might have been slightly better with Steve Perry's stronger vocals but the technology to to create it might not been as good. Incredible full sounding with outstanding visual quality including some beautiful Las Vegas women. A complete rock and roll band. If you want to demo your dolby digital system this will do it.
B00005JGAB|4.0|What an incredible album, true punk rock at it's best.  I feel like I'm listening to a history book with this, foreshadowing what was to come in the next decade and a half.  Puts modern &quot;punk&quot; rock to shame.
0451524985|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  Each time I read it I am struck by the relevancy of the topics presented and the startling grace of Lawrence's language.  I believe we have much to learn from this book about ourselves.  Despite the fact that sex is a rather hum drum topic in today's world the book is still shocking in the brutally honest and beautiful way it presents human relations with each other and the world on the whole.<br />Excellent literature instructs, as well as delights, and Lawrence presents an entertaining, but deep and complex lesson for his readers.  Take some time and read the book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The first reactions to this strange but enchanting movie were mixed, the loudest speakers saying that none of the actors can sing.  And if you are overcritical, you might think that.  But this story about love (which seems a lot like Camille) is amazing.  Every scene was bright and amazing, but the way it was filmed takes a little getting used to.  The romance played out my McGregor and Kidman is amazing, leaving you crying at the end (if you are that type of person).  But if you have a habit of blinking then you might need to watch a few scenes two or three times to catch everything (like the song when Satine meets the Duke in the tower and people are dancing at the same time in the Moulin Rouge).  All in all, a great hit!  I'm sorry not enough people were interested when it came out.
B00000K3D4|5.0|When I was 5 (I'm 18 now) I used to run for this tape at our local Blockbuster. I LOVED this movie...and at such a young age I couldn't really appreciate the wittiness of it. Now that I'm older, and have approximately seen this movie 1,000 times, I still love it. There is just something so magical about it. To me, Sarah was the quinessential young girl bordering on adulthood. She definitly had Peter Pan syndrome, but that was ok. Sarah was also gutsy, she had the gall to do something most older siblings only dreamed about...sending her younger brother Toby to the goblins. So when the hunky Gobling King, Jareth (played by a superb David Bowie) came to fufill her wish...she rebelled. And then being faced with solving the labyrinth in 13 hours she had the guts to actually SOLVE it. This movie is excellent. Good music, lots of adventure, and the age old story of a young girl finding herself in the fairytale land of her dreams. But Sarah is no Alice in Wonderland...so give this movie a go. And you might find yourself in the Underground.
0446677450|1.0|Why is this book so popular?  It is mostly a rehash of the tired themes of &quot;get rich in real estate&quot; and &quot;dodge income taxes through incorporation&quot;.  This book touches on several complex topics, but isn't prepared to discuss them in reasonable depth.  Instead, these complex topics are sandwiched between frequent exhortations to the financially downtrodden reader to free themselves!  While some tactics, like the 1031 exchange, can be quite useful, others can imperil the unwary.  Running personal expenses through a corporation is not a tactic to mention, then dance away from; it can border on &quot;tax audit roulette&quot;, which is a game competent advisors will not play.  If you haven't bought this book yet, I suggest not doing so. I think your valuable time will be better spent if you engage the services of a trustworthy team of financial advisors (CPA, insurance agent, broker, attorney) who will help you achieve your personal goals with a legally sound plan that makes economic sense in your circumstances!
B00004XQP4|5.0|green day. one of my favorite bands ever. growing up in the &quot;punk&quot;spotlight they were almost the spokespersons. they were the only punk the public knew. but yet they were bashed horribly after going mainstream. i for one am so glad they did. its a tough call on which album is my favorite, but WARNING definitly has a unique sound....which is what punk is all about. testing the limits. upon popping this one in my cd player, i labled it &quot;jewish ska&quot;. it has the beat. and the instrumentals give it the jewish &quot;flavor&quot;. lol. i personally love belting out the lyrics &quot;wake up, the house is on fire, and the cat's caught in the dryer!!!&quot;, while church on sunday and waiting are very catchy and have some personal meaning. the band holds some great stories within them, so give them a try. they are great!
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is quite possibly the best nine inch nails cd i've ever heard.  The one(s) in close competition with this would be The downward spiral, and the fragile, depending on my mood.

B00005QDW1|3.0|Rock Steady is a decent album. The tunes have grown on me. This album is narrowly saved from death by overproduction due to the fact that No Doubt can play. Tony, Tom and Adrian are SOLID and Gwen still must be considered one of the top vocalists in alternative music. No Doubt are who they are because they took control of their music, ala the self produced &quot;Beacon Street Collection&quot;. The band can be forgiven this attempt to cash in if they follow up quickly with a self produced album of serious music. This album is more pop than alternative, but is still worth the purchase for old and new No Doubt fans alike.

B00003CXXI|5.0|Hey. I am 11 years old and thought this movie wouldn't be so great. But, my  brothers wanted to see this and of course I had to go along. Watching it in the movie theatre I found that I just couldn't stop laughing. As always Eddie Murphy is genius(great cast). We got the DVD for Christmas and I can't stop watching it. I especially love the karaoke music video at the end. Plus the DVD has great special features including the revoice studio on DVD-rom. 2 thumbs up!
B000002J0N|5.0|I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that 1977's _CSN_ represents the best work Crosby, Stills, and Nash have ever done together.<br /><br />I don't mean to take anything away from their earlier albums. Their debut LP was deservedly a landmark in modern music history, and _Deja Vu_ -- with Neil Young in on the act -- was _another_ landmark. You have to go some way to beat _two_ landmarks.<br /><br />But I think CSN do so on this deceptively laid-back album. They've always described their work as being about the changes that they (and other people) go through, and every song here is a little gem about exactly that. (Including Nash's brooding \\"Cathedral,\\" which, one assumes, is about his own rejection of historical Christianity.)<br /><br />In only one or two other album reviews have I been able to say, about the work under review, that there are _no_ weak tracks. This is another. _CSN_ is the only album by any of these guys, alone or in combination, that I can listen through without ever skipping _any_ songs. (Actually I can't say that about too many albums by anyone at all.) But just the other day I listened through this one _twice_.<br /><br />This is one of the very few times that CSN have actually managed to be more than the separate sum of their parts. Stills is at his best here; he contributes five tunes, all winners, with \\"See The Changes\\" at the top of my own list for his best lyrics ever. Nash writes four, all of them gentle without being either sappy or mournful. Crosby writes two and a half (the brilliant \\"Shadow Captain\\" is a joint effort with keyboardist Craig Doerge), and \\"In My Dreams\\" is one of my longtime favorites of his. (It's also the song that probably best states the nature of CSN+/-Y itself: \\"Two or three people fading in and out / Like a radio station I'm thinking about / But I can't hear / Who gets breakfast? Who gets the lunch? / Who gets to be the boss of this bunch? / Who will steer?\\")<br /><br />The musicianship is breathtaking as well. For one thing, Stills _doesn't_ play every instrument on the album; Craig Doerge and Joe Vitale handle most of the keyboard work, with Stills sitting down at the piano only for \\"I Give You Give Blind\\". And when he _does_ play, he does it well: I've long thought that his acoustic guitar solo on \\"Fair Game\\" is one of his best, and he restrains himself admirably on Crosby's \\"In My Dreams.\\" The percussion work is particularly noteworthy (credit Russ Kunkel and Joe Vitale). And George Perry handles most of the bass-guitar duties.<br /><br />For another, all of the three are at their vocal peak. The harmonies here are delicately arranged and extremely well performed (and produced). Crosby hasn't gone very far down his long decline into drugs, and Stills's voice, though gravelly as always, can still carry a tune even into the upper register. And Nash is just _always_ reliable; no special comment required here.<br /><br />There are some albums that these three have done, separately and together, that come mighty close to this. I've already mentioned their debut album and _Deja Vu_; I'll add Crosby's _If I Could Only Remember My Name_, his work with CPR, Stills's first solo LP and _Manassas_, Nash's _Songs for Beginners_, and a couple of Crosby/Nash efforts. But to my own mind (though of course there's room for both disagreement and differences in taste), this one is the cream of a very large crop.play every instrument on the album; Craig Doerge and Joe Vitale handle most of the keyboard work, with Stills sitting down at the piano only for \\"I Give You Give Blind\\".

B000003TAW|5.0|Once dubbed as \\"one hit wonders\\", Weezer disproved all of the critics in 2001 with the release of their second self titled record, better known as \\"The Green Album\\".  Though I thoroughly enjoyed the latest album, I think Weezer truly proved themselves on the epic \\"Blue Album\\".  Rivers Cuomo uses his incredibly normal voice (that's not a negative thing) to produce classic vocals that will be remembered for years to come.  Songs such as \\"His name Jonas\\", \\"The world...\\", \\"Buddy Holly\\", \\"Undone\\", \\"Say it ain't so\\" and \\"In the garage\\" are some of the great tracks that encompass this album.  The \\"Blue Album\\" is a rock masterpiece that my generation an I will celebrate as long as rock is around...well in that case we can say it will be around forever.

B000021XS0|3.0|I'm not ashamed to admit it, I never really liked Dream Theater.  After reading a million good reviews of their work, I picked up a copy of this CD.  I can't say that it changed my mind about them.  A lot is made of their ability as musicians, and I think the instrumental pieces are awesome.  No, their downfall is the singer.  I can't believe anyone thinks this guy sings with passion.  To me, he sounds like he is reading from que cards.  Concept albums are difficult to do well, and I think the concept here misses the boat.  There is nothing about the story that makes me want to keep listening.  Buy one of the Liquid Tension Experiment CD's instead, that way you get the musicianship without the intervening moments of lameness.
B00005R87Q|3.0|&quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is a fast paced action picture. It has a gret plot with everything that guys love (cars, women, action, loud music. there's only one problem. It's all been done before. In 1990 a great action picture titled &quot;Point Break&quot; was released. It was so similar that if &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; had the same actors and charecters it could have been a sequel. Instead I think it's just a rip off. <BR>    There are some slight differences however (more like comparisons). In &quot;Point Break&quot; the bad guys, led by Patrick Swayze, surf and in this film the bad guys, led by Vin Diesel, race cars. In &quot;Point Break&quot; the bad guys rob banks and in this they rob semi-trucks (?), yes semi-trucks. Rapper Ja Rule has a cameo in &quot;The Fast and The Furious&quot; and Anthony Keidiis of The Red Hot Chili Peppers had a cameo in &quot;Point Break&quot;. In &quot;Point Break&quot; the hero (Keanu Reeves of recent day &quot;Matrix&quot; fame) meets his girlfriend (Lori Petty from &quot;Free Willy&quot; and not much since)in a restaraunt where she is the waitress and in &quot;The Fast And The Furious&quot; Paul Walker (&quot;Varsity Blues&quot;; &quot;Joyride&quot;) meets Jordana Brewster (&quot;The Faculty&quot;; &quot;The Invisible Circus&quot;) exactly the same way. Ted Levine (&quot;Bullet&quot;; &quot;Evolution&quot;) replaces the buddy cop in &quot;The Fast and The Furious&quot; that Gary Busey (&quot;Silver Bullet&quot;; &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) played in &quot;Point Break&quot;.<BR>    &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; even pretty much has the same ending as &quot;Point Break&quot;,which I won't give away to those who have not seen either film. I knew what was going to happen before the film was over just from having seen &quot;Point Break&quot; However &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is not a total waste of time. It feels like the sequel to &quot;Point Break&quot; that I always wanted but never came. &quot;Point Break&quot; is a much smarter film but when you're dealing with street racers and director Rob Cohen (&quot;The Skulls&quot;; &quot;Dragonherat&quot;) what did you expect. Vin Diesel does give an excellent performance as does Jordanna Brester and I expect great things from both actors in the future. However Paul Walker's performance as the unbelievable cop-hero falls flat. He can't even compare to Keanu Reeves and that's pretty sad.<BR>    It's a good film but if you haven't seen &quot;Point Break&quot; see it first. It's the original and it much better. Besides &quot;Point Break&quot; was an original idea.I think writer W. Peter Iliff deserves a story by credit &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. See both films and then you decide.
B000005IU2|5.0|This Fun House, like the carnival attractions it's named after, is fun but also scary and creepy and not all that wholesome.  Back when I first got ahold of this album, on a French import label (late '70's, when all of the Stooges' stuff was out of print in the USA), I tended to spend most of my time on Side 1 (the first four songs, ending with Dirt.)  Side 2 (1970 through LA Blues) were just *so* brutal, but when that certain mood hit, I didn't know of any other music that matched it so well.  I've become more accustomed to dissonance since then, I guess.  What we have here is an amazingly sharp, dense, harsh and muscular sonic attack that really doesn't sound like music from 30+ years ago, at least not to my ears.  I don't listen to a lot of new hard rock but I'd like to hear someone outdo these tracks for sheer power in the same amount of time.  The songs never drag, actually the whole album is remarkably well-paced.  Down on the Street kicks things off with a menacing prowl, Loose kicks things into high gear, TV Eye hints at the craziness still to come, with Dirt providing a slow-burn, catch-your-breath centerpiece to the album, before the out'n'out cacaphony starts with 1970.  Once the sax kicks in toward the latter half of that song, it's like the afterburners have been lit  and there's no turning back for the rest of the disc.  Words don't do it justice.  Lyrically, there is some mystery about what exactly Iggy is trying to say but the message comes through in the various grunts, squeals and howls that he cuts loose, adding another cataclysmic instrument to the potent combo that alas only held together long enough to make two immortal albums (the previous Stooges debut and this one.  Raw Power, also a classic, featured a different guitarist and a much different sound, despite the impact it made in solidifying Iggy's legend.)  Essential...
B000000W9Z|5.0|This is a good album, Bowie's best since Scary Monsters. The only bad thing is that it is a concept album and as thus it tries to make you care, even though you really don't, it has little 40 second things that carry the story by using spoken word stuff and I just skip them to get to the great songs like, Hearts Filthy Lesson (which was in the movie Seven) which is very Nine Inch Nailsish.<BR><BR>A good album, I suggest buying it.
630280082X|5.0|I first saw this video in 1986, a bootleg I'm afraid!<BR>The music is absolutely fantastic, Steve Via's role as The Devils Guitarist is superb he is the most fantastic guitarist I have ever known. This film is the next best thing to me seeing him playing live! A must for all avid guitar players!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Well I thought I was getting a musical story about Moulin Rouge. Wow!  I was really surprised!  At first it just seemed so weird that I wasn't really keeping up with the story, When Ewan McGregor started singing I was blown away!  Once I really got into it, it was really a powerful emotional story.  I ended up watching it again and I loved it.  Nicole Kidman can really sing too.  I am planning to buy this movie and watch it often.  The music is wonderful, the colors are fantastic, and the mood is great.
B00005QDW1|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS CD! It was the worst purchase of the year. It made me laugh at how bad it was, or was it the stupid lyrics?
0061053430|5.0|this book provides a great deal of information on the Colonial Marines from &quot;Aliens&quot;.  all of you potential Aliens video game modders out there must get this book. it has served as an excellent reference book for all my &quot;Aliens versus Predator&quot; modifications.  with several illustrations, it also provides the artist with valuable &quot;Aliens&quot; info. even the curious Sci-Fi geek will find this book thoroughly interesting.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Though not perfect, this is a great album. It's what all those people who bemoan the lack of popular good music are waiting for. The songs all have a tinny, obviously recorded, through the microphone feel, which does get somewhat annoying, but I feel that's the only main flaw. <BR>The Stokes honestly play rock and roll; the Modern Age especially sounds quite a bit like an old Velvet Underground song. Finally, a band who doesn't try to imitate Nirvana! They are obviously derivative, but at least they are talented and don't sound like today's awful pop/rock. It's welcome after all these &quot;rock bands&quot; like Dave Matthews, Matchbox 20, Creed, etc. I look forward to their next album to see what they're going to do next.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Russell Crowe puts in probably one of the best performances of his career as the genius, Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash. Based on a true story, John Nash attends Princeton and completes his Ph.D. dissertation on a revolutionary topic that eventually changes the way the financial world works. After graduation he accepts a prestigious position at the Wheeler Institute that does work for the government. Nash is at the top of his career when he gets sucked into a decoding project by William Parcher (Ed Harris). During this time he meets his future wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and starts a family. But his brushes with the life of espionage begin to take its toll and John's paranoid-schizophrenic side begins to reveal itself. John Nash was always known to be a little strange and quirky, but where did his real life begin and his imaginary one end? I'll leave that up to the viewing of the flick. <br />As I said above, Russell Crowe really is a great actor. He gets blasted as being overrated (mainly because of Gladiator), but the guy really can act and convince us that he's someone other than Russell Crowe. Sadly, if Crowe does not win a Best Actor Oscar (which he probably won't) for this roll, that will make his award for Gladiator even that much more worthless and pointless. His performance in A Beautiful Mind is head and shoulders above what he gave us in Gladiator. Jennifer Connelly also puts in one of the best performances of her career. In fact, the entire cast doesn't have a single weak link. It's really hard to talk more to the plot without giving away some of the twists. But I can say that the ending is not one of these sappy ones (because it's true) or sad ones (where the struggling hero gets killed). The only reason I didn't bump it up into the A- territory is that it's just a teeny bit on the longish side. For a movie that is almost 100% action-free, relying on dialogue for over 2 hours is a hard thing to pull off. Ron Howard's directing is spot on as usual.<br />If you like movies where the hero is intelligent yet vulnerable...you should dig A Beautiful Mind.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I just saw Kate &amp; Leopold, and it is funnier than I imagined, even funnier than &quot;French Kiss&quot;, which is another Meg Ryan film I like very much.  The scenes with Meg &amp; her younger brother (Breckin Meyer)are quite funny, and the scenes with Meg &amp; Hugh Jackman are funny as well.  This film is much better than I expected because of the romantic twists that were brilliantly interwoven with the underlying comedy.  So, I got to laugh quite a bit, and be moved to tears as well.  Meg Ryan's performance was brilliant because she knows how to support her fellow actors, helping make them shine.  I went away from this film with a good feeling--it was funny, uplifting and very satisfying.  Few films can do this, and I will see this film many more times, I'm sure!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Before \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" 1937's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" was THE definitive children's motion picture.  Walt Disney's debut feature works splendidly on so many levels: as an animated film, as a compelling story, and as a musical.  True, some parts are very dated, and the movie does indeed drag in some places, but you'll have to suspend criticism and acknowledge \\"Snow White\\"'s technical achievements.  The idea of doing a full-length cartoon was apparently unheard of in 1937, and few believed that this picture would be a hit.  Not only have the box office receipts proved the naysayers wrong, but it's been re-released over the years to generation after generation.  The DVD picture is as good as it gets, with no print flaws or grain.  The surround sound mix, however, is a bit flawed and sounds slightly artificial.  I don't think Walt intended to do this film for a high-tech home theater network.  Regardless, if you have to own ONE animated DVD, \\"Snow White\\" is a must-have.  It's a beautifully done feature and is an undisputed classic.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Both my spouse and I enjoyed the movie greatly!  My husband being six years older than I had experienced the time set of the movie and absolutely flipped over the music!  After purchasing the CD, I was required to purchase the tape!  I could see how my husband enjoyed this music and purchased the Down From the Mountain tape also.  Thinking about my grandfather and parents going through the depression, I was able to better connect with the history &amp; life style of the time.  Having a music background, I found the informational inserts on the work of Mr. John Hartford and others very interesting.  ...is that where the expression &quot;run out on a rail&quot; came from!?! Learn something new every day!!! (referring to part in movie where gentleman is escorted out on what looks like an old rail road tie!).  Back to the music, my husband does not dance much however, just put the soggie bottom boys on and he boogies on down! (slightly nervous when he started dancing on the scaffolding while building his garage this summer!)
6303471714|4.0|I think this video is great.  It has 3 workouts in one video.  That was the first thing I loved about it. But I would only recommend this video to people that have been working out from the beginning because if you are a beginner this video is not for you.  She does some great work on the legs and abs.  I suggest everyone should have this video in there collection.

B00005K3OT|4.0|Director Lasse Hallstrom has become Miramax's Golden Boy of the moment: his 1999 picture, \\"Cider House Rules\\" won 2 Academy Awards, and his 2000 \\"Chocolat\\" grabbed a handful of nominations as well. It's a simple fable about a nomad (Juliette Binoche) who settles in an ultraconservative French town and opens up a chocotat store--smack dab in the middle of Lent. The town's Mayor, pastor, and many of its residents are none too pleased with this lady, who doesn't share their Catholic beliefs. The film goes on to stress the importance of tolerance, but the movie is so handsomely produced that you forget how simplistic this story really is. Nevertheless, it's a well-assembled DVD package with decent picture and sound as well as a nice featurette that includes the cast and crew members. \\"Chocolat\\" didn't quite deserve to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it's a decent fable that will pass 2 hours of your time nicely. Like the confection after which it's named, \\"Chocolat\\" is slight but sweet.
B000001EPB|5.0|When I try to think of simply ONE word to describe this work of art, I fail miserably.  This is, without a doubt, THE most amazing, wonderful, and unforgettable CD I have ever listened to. I myself am fascinated and enthralled with celtic and Irish everything...so when my Irish dance teacher told me about Lord of the Dance and how amazing the music is, I knew I just had to get the CD for myself. I give this CD two thumbs way way up!!! Don't miss out on this incredible journey through celtic music!!
B000022TSW|4.0|I admit, I was not one of those folks who ran out to see South Park as soon as it hit the theaters.  In fact, I didn't even run out to rent South Park when it was released on VHS and DVD.  But I finally did rent it in a moment of weakness, and am so glad I did.  A few minutes into the film I had to scrape my jaw off the floor, but then I laughed my head off for 90 minutes and promptly watched the film again.  After I returned the rental, I bought the DVD, and still watch it whenever I need a laugh.<br />South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut is, in a word, brilliant.  From the Disney-esque musical numbers (skewered by the biting wit of the lyrics) to the I-can't-believe-they-just-said-that vulgar hilarity of Terrance and Phillip to the &quot;Saddam is from Mars, Satan is from Venus&quot; moments sprinkled throughout, South Park is the best piece of satire written in years, and is guaranteed to keep you in stitches.<br />The movie is set in, of course, South Park, home of our heroes Cartman, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle.  The boys manage to worm their way in to a theater to see Canadian duo Phillip and Terrence's new R-rated movie, which is brimming with jaw-dropping language.  It proves &quot;educational&quot; to the boys, and they're swearing with flair and gusto quicker than you can say... well... you'll have to imagine.  From there, it's a short leap to horrified teachers, mortified parents, and then Mothers Against Canadians.  And it would be criminal to give away any more of the plot.<br />Yes, the language is positively filthy....  Yes, the film ridicules networks willing to do anything for ratings, Hollywood families of fame, overbearing and misguided parents, and everyone in between....  Yes, there are many moments of plain grossness....  So if you're easily offended, generally uptight, or a member of any morally outraged group, this film is not for you.  This film is ABOUT you.  Find something else to watch.<br />But for everyone else: buy this movie.  You'll laugh; you'll cry (well, maybe not cry...); it will become a part of you.<br />Last note:  The only reason I rated this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is the complete lack of extra features.  The movie is certainly worthy of a 5 star rating, but the complete lack of extras for the DVD format, especially given this material that's just screaming for extras, is inexcusable.  But I highly recommend purchasing the movie, anyway.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of &quot;Mad Max&quot;, but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!
B00005O5CM|5.0|I didn't see this movie in the theater because I was under the impression that it was a stupid teen movie, but after watching the DVD I really enjoyed it.  I actually found it to be quite empowering and even my boyfriend didn't think it was a real chic flic.<br />     Reese Witherspoon was excellent in her role as the sorority girl who goes to college seeking parties and a husband.  When her boyfriend dumps her instead of proposing she goes into a depression and comes up with a plan to get him back.  What actually transpires is that she gets back at him by finding out who she is and going after it despite what other people said or thought. <br />     The DVD had some extras about the making of the movie and the importance and time spent on Reese's hair color and style.  Now, usually that sounds stupid and not something I would ever want to see, but it really gave you an appreciation for what could be a small detail, but a huge deal.  All the extras were worth watching.<br />     I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate simple humor, a cute plot and a beautiful movie.  Legally Blonde was definately worth seeing by this brunette!
B00005QDW1|4.0|When I first listened to this CD to celebrate finishing a Spanish project, I was a bit disapointed by the difference. I missed some of the elements of previous albums, like the neo-punk energy. But after I gave it a second chance, I liked it more. I've come to enjoy the fun, upbeat dance tunes like &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Hey Baby.&quot;  Another positve point was the rather catchy &quot;Underneath it All,&quot; that had a beat reminiscent of &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; which was one of my favorites from &quot;Tragic Kingdom.&quot;  Not only that, there is a lot of variety in the types of music that were fused, which can be good. Overall, I would say that this is an album that grows on you. While you might not like it very much on the first listen, it gets better after a few listens, as the sound is different from previous work.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I must admit, I am a Disney-a-holic, so when a computer animated film made by Dreamworks was getting high acclaim, I avoided it.  I didn't see it in the movies, but once released on DVD, I got a bit curious and was suprised at what I found.<br />     As this movie is aimed at a wide audience, I found enough to engross many children and enough to also engage an older crowd.  At first I was extremely skeptical of the cast, as I don't usually like Mike Meyers at all, but his voice was disguised enough that I didn't mind.  Also, Cameron Diaz usually annoys me, but her voice and character were well cast.  <br />     Shrek became a loveable creature and even though the plot is not complicated and somewhat predictable, it was definately enjoyable.  There were many stabs at Disney, but I didn't get too offended. <br />     All-in-all, Shrek was a well done movie with creative dialogue, beautiful scenes and an entertaining plot.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys computer animated movies.
B00003CXRP|5.0|'Cast Away' is an emotional and more relatable step up from 'Lord of the Flies' and your average &quot;shipwreck&quot; movie. Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a busy Federal Express top employee, who's made this time-consuming and often unpredictable job his long-term career. The first plus point before the story takes over is that Hanks is not a man with nothing, who would not see surviving on his own instincts for a long time some sort of religious awakening. He does his best to squeeze his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) into a schedual so busy around the Holidays that he carries a beeper with him to Christmas dinner. On a last minuet flight for Fed-Ex on Christmas eve, a long and realistic plane crash scene leaves him stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific. In the 80s' especially weve scene Hanks' phenomenal comedic abilities, his obvious talent at drama and the trademark ways about him that, well...make him Tom Hanks. All are rolled into one in this movie, when he uses his only resources on the island provided by nature..(and a few Fed-Ex packages that followed him to shore) to stay alive. To tell the truth I thought a big jump in time as you'll see, would ruin the movies' genuine effect...but it does hardly that. I think after his rescue and return to what is now a strange place to him..the entire movie is summed up in a quiet speach he gives to a friend. He realizes that the harshes he faces returning to civilization cannot take-over him, that he has to stay alive. My favorite part would be Hanks striking a candle lighter, beginning to realize all of the things in life he'd taken for granted before his four years on the island. Dont let editorial reviews or Roger 'Fat' Ebert's thoughts on the movie decide for you whether or not to watch 'Cast Away'...sometimes I think movie-reviewers are payed to hate everything. 'Cast Away' is a refreshing and meaningful comedy/drama that will be well appreciated in the years to come...just think of ALL Tom Hanks' recent movies....
078322799X|4.0|Peter Jackson is a visual genius, and here he works with some really wonderful special effects as well as fun and energetic performances to create an underrated joy ride of a thriller that pulls out all stops.  Michael J. Fox is pitch perfect, Dee Wallace Stone is a blast, the creepy ghoul is awesome, and Danny Elfman's score is spectacular!  Unpredictable, funny, suspenseful, and even a little scary at times, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; is one fun little horror film!

067942850X|4.0|Chris McCandless set some unusual expectations for himself.  Except for some bad luck, he probably would have survived to write his own account of his travels.  One telling comment of Krakauer's is (to paraphrase), &quot;for some, a challenge is only worthwhile if the outcome is in doubt&quot;.  If nothing else, Chris' story is a good seed for debates on the relative merits of freedom and safety.<br />Regardless of one's opinion of Chris and his lifestyle, the book is an interesting read.  I look forward to reading Krakauer's other books.
014028902X|4.0|I read this book with a certain amount of jealousy. Like Durrell I had a childhood fascination with animals and Nature in general. Unlike Durrell I did not come from a leisure-class family and my mother would not have allowed me to revive heat-struck water snakes in the bath tub.<br />This is a very funny book and it is related in a very dry tone of voice. Durrell succeeds in limiting the narrative to the perspective of a 10 year old boy. His older sister Margo remains an object of derision throughout the book and the young Durrell seems to have had no interest in or respect for 'girl stuff'. He is the perfect little Edwardian naturalist; you can just seem him poring through his big thick references books to try to figure exactly what insect he's got in his jar of alcohol. The book is filled with Wodehousian eccentrics including his entire family, but also other ex-patriate Brits (Theodore and Mr. Kralkefsky) and Spiro, the mountainous cab-driver and unofficial island potentate.<br />Each chapter is fairly self-contained and the book is organized as a seasonal precession. One of the most memorable chapters, and the one that most approaches the level of literature, is Durrell's initial encounter with one of his many tutors, Mr. Kralkefsky. This chapter has the least to do with natural history and includes an almost surreal passage about Gerry's encounter with his tutor's mother. There really isn't a dull moment in this book, however, with elder brother 'Larry' Durrell fairly consistently serving the purpose of a sort of Bertie Wooster-with-brains figure. One particularly funny comic device is Durrell's description of the arguments between Larry and his mother over where the family should live. The chapters always end with his mother's adamant refusal to accept her son's suggestions, but things never come off as expected. The chapter on the final dinner party on the island is a comic tour de force.<br />More than any other book I have read, this narrative made me wantto visit the Greek islands. I only hope that some remanant of the natural and pastoral landscape that Durrell describes remains on Corfu.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe and everyone associated with this movie got a standing ovation at the showing I attended.  How refreshing it was to see a sensitive, serious drama that not only allows you to leave the theater understanding what happened, but feeling good, actually hopeful, that the hardships life deals you can be overcome with persistence, determination, and the support of family and friends.<br />This is the true story of John Nash, a Princeton student and brilliant mathematician who is treated for schizophrenia.  Crowe is magnificent as he battles his delusions (or are they real?) and has an excellent supporting cast in Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg and all involved.  Bravo to Ron Howard for bringing this most interesting story of the 1994 Nobel Prize winner to the screen.<br />Dysfunction was never so poignant, empathy so heartfelt as for the beleaguered Nash and his loving wife who made the difficult decision to stand by him through a monumental crisis.  Viewers are with the couple every step of the way from their initial meeting and awkward courtship to their often-troubled marriage.<br />The movie has classic lines such as Nash telling a friend that he is well-balanced because he has a chip on both shoulders. There is much humor to balance the sadness, much hope to combat the seemingly impossible situation.<br />In the end, it is the theme of battling your demons and overcoming the odds to lead a fulfilling life that makes you leave the theater feeling uplifted as a result of this movie.  Definitely, one not to miss.
B00005R87Q|1.0|...  <br />I agree \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" has some good action, but a Toyota running a close race with a 1000hp, supercharged, 440 cubic inch, V8 car is completely and totally ridiculous.  It just defies the laws of physics!<br />If you are one of those people who think you can modify your rice burner to run with real muscle cars, this movie is definately for you.  If so, watch this movie and keep on dreaming.
B0017APPT8|5.0|There's a hidden secret government agency known as \\"MIB\\" or \\"Men in Black\\" for short, their mission is to keep all aliens from space under wraps from the public as far as possible and to protect humanity from the scum of the universe. MIB Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) has been assigned by leader Zed (Rip Torn) to find a police officer named J (Will Smith) who witnesses something unusual that could lead him to become a member of the MIB, unfornuately when a hideous bug monster disguises itself as a human farmer (Vincient D'Onofrio) who plans big plans for Earth but it's up to the MIB to solve a case and try to stop the alien menace.<br /><br />Co-starring Linda fiorentino, this is a stylish and exciting Sci-fi comedy based on a cult short-lived Malibu comic book of the same name. Barry Sonnefeld (\\"The Addams Family\\") directed this movie quite well and the acting is solid especially the smart humor that incorporated this movie, it's a satire on what if aliens were really among us yet they want to be kept under wraps among the humans. The film even offers brilliant make-up and special effects by Industrial Light and Magic and Rick Baker giving us realistic alien critters that no one has seen before on film and there's plenty of great fun in this movie that made it a pure big blockbuster among audiences and critics alike.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers nice quality pic and sound even for HD lovers with great extras like audio visual commentary, Trailer and Teaser, featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, Storyboard comparisions, Documentary, music video, galleries, interactive games, scene editing workshop, and BD-live.
B00005JKES|4.0|The rights to the pilot episode of Twin Peaks are owned by a different company. It is available as a 15$ import DVD via Amazon... Try searching! It's not that hard!<br />All in all, it's amazing to see the series remastered, especially if you've watched the videos over and over again. A fine set!!
B00004R99J|2.0|99.9999% of the time I LOVE what Disney produces!! But once in a great while everyone gets a lemon. And this is Disneys sourest!! <br />The premise was good, but I found the animation poor and the story extremely boring. Audiences will be graced with yet another good vs. evil type story. Throw in a heroine and give her strong earthy crunchy morals and you get this dribble. And of course there is a love story. &lt;blink blink&gt; And as a bonus to the so so animation, you will get a so so score.<br />The good point to this movie is Mel Gibson, who does a wonderful job. Outside of that, we are looking at a story that will appeal to young kids who have never seen another Disney flick. <br />At least rent before you buy on this one. Perhaps your opinion differs.....
B00003CXTG|5.0|I totally enjoyed this film and it was also one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The triangle romance was very appealing and heartfelt.  The battle scenes were magnificent and the acting wonderful all around.  I won't go into what it was about because that is obvious, but it was a good depiction of the beginning of the War for the U.S.  This is one movie every American should see at least once.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Excellant music, great to listen to, but not quite a classic album.  Get it if you enjoy Santana.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I loved this movie!  Connery plays a great writer who only published one book and won the Pulitzer.  Jamal is a black kid from the streets who loves basketball and is an aspiring writer.  Connery ends up teaching Jamal the secrets of writing in private and Jamal wins acclaim for this.  All the actors in this film were great.<br />This movie deals with loss, romance and stereotypes in very convincing ways.  This movie has substance and was able to hold my attention from start to finish.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good, old-fashioned film.
158234082X|4.0|This is a great book for foodies, cooks, and especially cook wannabe's.  Bourdain's writing style is very colorful and makes for an entertaining, quick read.<br />One caveat, it may change (make that &quot;should change&quot;) the way you eat in restaurants (ie - it ain't always pretty).
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is excellent and witty.  The movie is not the only good part about this movie because the special features were fascinating!  The best special feature is the Shrek Kariokke party.  It is such a funny addition to the movie that you should at least rent this DVD because of it.
B00005R2BG|1.0|It's difficult to watch a movie supposedly taking place in the year 1899-1900 and hear Elton John, The Beatles and Madonna quoted.  Sad, really.  I watched the entire movie strictly because Craig Armstrong is such a brilliant composer.  The original music is as I would expect from Mr. Armstrong.  The movie was over the top--that's OK, but overall, very poor.
B00003CWRX|4.0|The Insider has little action, little violence and little romance.  And it is one of the five best movies I have seen in the past five years.  It is another in a long line of great performances by Al Pacino, who (in my book) is the finest living American actor.  It also is the breakout performance of Russell Crowe, who unfortunately had to compete against Kevin Spacey's American Beauty performance, or he would have won the Oscar for his role as Jeffrey Wigand.<br />These two actors have great chemistry in this movie about 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman's (Pacino) attempt to get Wigand to come on to his show and expose his secrets about the tobacco industry.  The many fits of anger the two men rage are convincing (Pacino is at his best when he is extremely angry - witness the closing scene of Scent of a Woman).  Crowe's portrayal of Wigand's many insecurities is masterful.  These two men are on their game in this great movie and I can never turn it off when it shows up on cable (although I have the movie in VHS and DVD).<br />About that DVD.  A disappointment because it is misleading.  I thought that the DVD contained a &quot;making of&quot; documentary and audio commentary of Crowe and Pacino.  Since I know the dialog of the movie, I thought the audio comments of these two great actors would be a nice little add on not found on the VHS version.  So I picked it up.  BEWARE - in reality, the documentary is all of about 15 minutes long (if that) and the &quot;audio commentary&quot; of Pacino and Crowe is really just snippets (probably totalling all of 2 minutes) of interviews done with them that is embedded in the documentary.  No actors audio track after all.  I think enough DVDs have been produced where somebody who sees &quot;audio commentary&quot; assumes a separate track.  WRONG!!<br />A great movie, a subpar DVD.  See it, especially if you love 60 Minutes.

B00005U18E|4.0|The third in the line of successful British romantic comedies penned by Richard Curtis, `Bridget Jones' is thankfully a lot better than `Notting Hill' whilst never quite achieving the highs of `Four Weddings And A Funeral'.  With the books being such a success, it was only a matter of time before Bridget Jones hit the big screen.  She does it in style too, this being one of the best British movies of its type for a long while.  It tells the tale of Bridget, a thirty-something single woman looking for love - will it be the standoffish Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) or her suave boss Daniel Cleaver?  If this sounds either overly familiar or formulaic then you'd be wrong.  This is injected with enough wit, humour and fantastic performances to easily entertain for its running length.<br />Renée Zellweger is effortlessly endearing in her role as Bridget, a role for which she actually gained weight for - unheard of usually.  The fact that she is such a likeable character is that Zellweger plays her with such naivety that it's hard not to sympathise with her struggles to lose weight, find a man, and get a good job.  You get the feeling that this is a real woman, not some Hollywood fantasy.  Bridget isn't perfect and therein lays her appeal.  Hugh Grant as one of her love interests is great in a role that's thankfully a good deal different from the stuttering shy Englishman that he's so used to playing.  The serious Colin Firth is also good in a role that is basically a reprisal of his Mr. Darcy in TV's `Pride And Prejudice'.  It's a credit to the film that their rivalry is played out realistically without resorting to taking sides.  The supporting cast, of course, consists of various stalwarts from television, including Celia Imrie and Sally Phillips (from the award-winning comedy `Smack The Pony').<br />There's little to dislike here, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and an ending that is sweet rather than sickly.  There's even attempts to bring some humanity into it all with the breakdown of Bridget's parents' marriage.  Not only is this handled sensitively, but there's also a good deal of humour packed in there too.  There's no mistaking it: Bridget Jones is a winner.
B000054OXU|2.0|One interesting thing about Neil Young is that he's never made a tossed-off, unengaged, musically dull album. He's made bad albums, of course, but they're fascinatingly bad because he's come up with some bizarre musical concept and he's making a mess of it.<br />Exhibit A: &quot;Landing on Water&quot;. Three musicians, all playing synthesisers, with pounding drums dominating the mix. Synthesizers often play the bass parts, but several songs have no bass at all. Some sampling: breaking glass, treated voices. A children's choir on two songs. Young's familiar voice and stinging lead guitar sitting on top. Simple, mostly banal lyrics about paranoiacs, phobics, psychotics and other lost souls.<br />And some of it works - the best stuff is at the start, tracks like &quot;Violent Side&quot; and &quot;Hippie Dream&quot;. But the material sags in the second half, until after five thumping, droning minutes of &quot;Drifter&quot;, with its duck-quack synthesizer riff, you're relieved that it's finally over.<br />Funnilly enough for a synth-soaked mid-80's album, this doesn't really sound dated - probably because no-one else made synth-soaked mid-80's records like this one. Another funny thing is that I play this beast a lot more than some of the &quot;good&quot; Neil Young albums like &quot;Comes a Time&quot; or &quot;Harvest&quot;. I get a kick out of its half-baked weirdness.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|The director wants us to believe that a person who experiences an airline crash and near-drowning, then four years of isolation and hardship, can do so without once uttering the  name of God. I suspect that even an atheist, when confronted with these traumas, would eventually find solace in some kind of supernatural being. Proof: What three words were most often heard when New Yorkers witnessed the collapse of the Trade Towers? &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;<br />I'm not a religious person. But I do know that no culture in the history of man has failed to find, invent or create some kind of deity. But Hanks' character spent four years with no companionship of any kind, and the only way he used his mind was to learn basic survival skills? No philosohical ruminating, no deep thoughts, no epiphanies? Sorry, this is just too hard to believe.

B00005QDW1|5.0|The first two reviews currently displaying on Amazon here describe this as a terrible album, where &quot;all the songs are just the chorus repeating.&quot;  Whoever you are, you've been tricked.  You obtained MP3s from song-swapping services, and those MP3s had approximately the correct length, just like the real tracks, but they're fake repeats of the chorus lines.  I don't know if someone intentionally flooded the swap services with these to prevent piracy or sales of the album or what.<br />I was rather disgusted when I downloaded a few tracks and listened to them, not realizing they were samples, but since I own a couple of No Doubt's previous albums, I was thinking that there was no way they would go from such rich flavor to lack-of-content repetition.  If you look around the song swap services some more, or listen to the radio, you'll find it's all a big joke / hoax / screw-up.<br />Anyway, as for my take on the new album, they're evolving a bit, mixing styles to become more of a hip-hop-ska hybrid genre than the punk-ska that was on the red, self-titled album.  Frankly, I like each new album a little more than the last... keep it up, No Doubt.
B00000348D|5.0|Let's get rid of some myths about this great CD.<br />First of all, &quot;Free Jazz&quot; is NOT CHAOS.  Listening to this all the way proves it; &quot;First Take&quot; is the same piece, and if you compare &quot;Free Jazz&quot; and &quot;First Take,&quot; you will see similarities and structure.  So let's get rid of the idea that this was &quot;totally improvised&quot; first.  There is an underlying structure to this piece, and you can figure it out if you try.<br />Secondly: it is NOT ATONAL.  What is happening here is that several different melodies are going on all at the same time, but each melody that each musician plays is meant to interact with the melodies the other musicians are playing.  There are no chords, and there is no ESTABLISHED, FORMAL tonal center.  But just because there is no FORMAL tonal center, doesn't mean there isn't one.<br />Third: It is NOT AMELODIC.  There are lots of melodies here.  If you listen to it, you can find lots of melody.  They may be odd melodies, but they are there.  In particular, everything that Eric Dolphy plays and everything that Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman play makes perfect sense melodically.  You may not agree with their tone choices or with the concept of &quot;harmolodics&quot; that underlies this piece, but listening to it, you will find melody.<br />Fourth: IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO.  The other reviews compare this music to higher mathematics and imply that listening to this is impossible unless you're an intellectual.  The best way to approach this music is with NO PRECONCEPTIONS, including the preconception that you have to be an &quot;intellectual&quot; to appreciate this music.  &quot;Free Jazz&quot; is a futuristic version of the early jazz bands, where everyone played solos all the time over a melody that was not played but generally understood.  The only difference is that here, there are several melodies, all of which interact, and the piece is set free from strict 4/4 time.<br />The best way to listen to this is to forget what everyone tells you about it, and just let it happen in the room.  Let it play all the way out, even the &quot;dissonant&quot; parts, and listen to it.  Listen for the funny parts, the humorous asides, the way Ornette's wry lemony sax contrasts with the dry growl of Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet and Don Cherry's rounded trumpet.  And please, don't miss Scott LaFaro and Charlie Haden having a bass conversation, or the way that Billy Higgins and Ed Blackwell interact with each other; these four people are counted among the best on their instruments, ever, and what they do here counts.<br />Don't treat this as abstract, intellectual, &quot;weirdo&quot; music.  Listen to it without any preconceived notions.  Don't compare it to anything else.  Let &quot;Free Jazz&quot; be free; that's part of the meaning of it.  Just listen.  Then listen again.  Then you'll get it.  Promise.to listen to this is to forget what everyone tells you about it, and just let it happen in the room.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|The opening scene sets the stage: you think you are about to witness a typical Disney, fairy-tale movie.  Then Shrek rips the page out of the fairy-tale book and uses it to wipe himself in the outhouse (yes, we are spared the details).  Between the killer commentary from Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers, kids and adults will be kept riveted to the screen.  In many ways, this movie was enjoyable the way Aladin was -- Robin Williams jokes were funny to kids on one level but enjoyable for adults on another.<br />Highly recommend.  Just be careful about singing to the birds...
6305546789|4.0|\\"You haven't really seen Halloween unless you've seen it in Widescreen\\". That's the statement at the bottom of the Australian DVD version.  How \\"totally\\" correct.  If you were like me, and had only ever seen a cropped video version, you are in for a real treat with the widescreen DVD version.<br />Halloween has an incredible score which helps build sheer terror atmosphere.  The film focusses on a creepy looking man on a killing spree with one aim - to kill a certain person.<br />The film has been lovingly transferred to DVD, largely attributable to them locating an untouched negative.  It is so clear, it has to be seen to be believed!  The Aussie version only has 2.0 surround sound, but the Amercian version has an impressive 5.1 mix.<br />Now, if they could only release a better transfer for Halloween 2, then we would all be happy.
B00005NZBN|5.0|I know turning 60 has not been kind to Bob Dylan's voice but his songwriting skills have aged very well. Dylan produced this record himself and he hits it just right. From rock, to blues to swing to love songs he covers a large span of American song types. And he does it well. The opening tune 'Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum' rollicks from the get go. 'Mississippi' is just full of heartache with a very pretty melody. Dylan seems to touch on all types of American culture here with just great songwriting. He delves into those dark, dusty, shadowy lives of the small and every day people and prefectly tells their stories. Dylan truly is the troubador.<br />His band on the record is his road band and not enought can be said for this outfit. These guys rock, stomp, whisper, shout, sway and just sound so good together. Really a tight unit. Just listen to 'Honest with Me'for an example of simple hard driving rock music. This record is a must listen. Buy it, steal it, down load it but just get it.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|... there is nothing clever about this.  I was really looking forward to this as the complexity and originality of it had been highlighted by many reviews.  At the end of viewing it, I thought, this is over-rated.  I see no point in showing a movie backwards - they've done it so we can put the pieces together ourselves - but why would we want to. The story isnt that great anyway.  I've read that many distributors wouldn't buy this movie and I can see why.  A big yawn.
B0000399WI|5.0|You never notice a man's shoes. I can't say enough about this movie. I have probably seen this movie 100 times, and I will never tire of it. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) head up a terrific cast in this thrilling drama about life inside the walls of Shawshank Prision. This movie keeps you guessing. I love how they never tell you why Red is in there, makes you wonder. Everyone should watch this movie, buy it, it might be on TNT every other second, but they cut out parts and you need to see the whole thing without commerical interuption!
B00005QDW1|4.0|I was alittle worried about buying this CD after reading all of the prior reviews.  But since I don't always listen to others I purchased the CD.  The first time I listened to it I was like is that all?  Can this truely be the CD that I have been waiting a year for?  Well it was.  After buckling down and given my favorite band there chance for the second time....I actually liked it.  I must admit it is no TK.  There will never be another TK we all need to realize that.  But Rock Steady while not the &quot;normal&quot; stuff you expect from No Doubt actually turned into quite a refreshing change.  The whole CD actually fits together quite nicely.  I have since listened to it 100+ times and I am not gonna stop because I have found it quite addictive.  I say buy it.  In time you will like it.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I bought this CD a while back because I liked &quot;My Favorite Game.&quot; I'd heard it on the radio and found it very catchy. The only other song I'd heard before that was &quot;Lovefool&quot; (which I loved) from the Romeo and Juliet Soundtrack, so when Iistened to the rest of this CD, I wasn't prepared for the difference in musical styles. This CD is darker, and not as peppy. My initial reaction was that it sucked and I put it away for months. Luckily, I pulled it out of mothball, and on the second listen I kept asking myself, &quot;what was I thinking? This CD is great!&quot; It's become a staple in my car's CD changer. It's very sing-able and moody. Great beats... perfect for driving.
B000002UJQ|5.0|from 6:30-7:30 on a sunday night, i had the strangest rock expierience ever. Stranger that even sgt peppers or anything like that.its name is OK Computer and its performed by a band called radiohead. this totally radical album sounds like new age rock and roll, sort of like neo-punk. Unlike most albums, it sounds like this album made itself, and these five people are doing they're performance of it instead of the other way around. Some of the best songs are the strangley uplifting &quot;Airbag&quot; and &quot;Paranoid android&quot; as well as the lyrical, emotional songs like &quot;Subterrenean homesick alien&quot; and &quot;Karma police&quot; But i say some of the best because all the songs are the best, those are the ones that just came to mind. it really is true when i say this: not only have you ever heard music played quite this way before, but it totally affects you and stays efective long after the listen is over.
B00005JHAD|5.0|I'm not a big fan of recent movies, but this one is brilliant.  This movie is intriguing from start to finish.  It's hilarious, insightful, and extraordinarily original.

0790729628|4.0|I have never seen the original theatrical cut.  I notice some reviewers complain the director's cut is confusing; although I had issues with the script, I did not find the film confusing per se.<br />To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.  The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay.  Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir.  The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.<br />The cast--including Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Darryl Hannah, and Rutger Hauer--gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone.  But the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and &quot;retiring&quot; (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth.  Although I greatly admire the film's decidedly &quot;open-ended&quot; conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.  We are persistently asked to ask believe that Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponet more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.  In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance.  It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.<br />The DVD offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats.  The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film.  The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional.  Aside from the choice of formats and brief biographies of the principal players, there are no extras of any kind.consistently engaging way.

B00005QXXO|3.0|I've never seen Radiohead live, but I've heard great things about their shows.  This album, however, makes me doubtful.<br />Generally, I like live tracks to improve upon the studio version, but that only happens once on this album: on \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\"  The piano driven live version sounds like a totally different song than what we heard on Amnesiac.  It sounds like \\"Street Spirit\\" played on a piano.<br />But the highlight of the album is the last track, \\"True Love Waits.\\"  This simple acoustic song is one of the best in the Radiohead catalog, and this is the only place you can find it (besides poor quality bootlegs).<br />The major let down of the album was the track selection.  This is Radiohead's only live EP, but it only contains songs from the Kid A sessions.  They could have included old favorites like \\"Talk Show Host\\" and \\"Pearly,\\" or given fans an official version of unreleased songs, like \\"Big Ideas (Don't Get Any)\\" and \\"Follow Me Around.\\"  But they didn't.<br />And Thom's vocals are consistently bad throughout.<br />Radiohead is my favorite band (I have 20 of their CDs), but I believe they could have made this one considerably better.  Regardless, get it for \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" and \\"True Love Waits.\\"  Or better yet, make your own mix of live Radiohead songs; I guarantee it will be better than \\"I Might Be Wrong.\\"
B000002U9E|5.0|At first listening, HOUNDS OF LOVE would seem to have little in common with Kate Bush's previous work; in some ways, however, it is a logical extension, for throughout her earlier work she had increasingly fused unlikely instruments with synthesizers while gradually leaving behind certain vocal affectations.  For HOUNDS OF LOVE she would repeat this, fusing distinctly Irish-sounding instruments with synthesizers while continuing to downplay her extraordinary range to create a remarkably clean yet multi-layered sound that serves her material remarkably well.  At the same time, she worked her penchant for macabre and bizarre imagery into a much more subtle idiom.  The resulting HOUNDS OF LOVE seems, to me at least, like a combination of the melodic delicacy of her earliest recordings with the raw power of her immediately previous THE DREAMING.<br />HOUNDS OF LOVE breaks into two distinctly separate yet stylistically similar parts, and it is a tribute to Bush's talents that she was able to unify these portions in such a way as to make them obviously different in content without making them feel separate in tone. The first half of the recording-&quot;Running Up That Hill,&quot; &quot;Hounds of Love,&quot; &quot;Big Sky,&quot; &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort,&quot; and &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;-are at once independent of each other yet distinctly of the same album, raveling the same musical and lyrical thread.  The second half-&quot;And Dream of Sheep,&quot; &quot;Under Ice,&quot; &quot;Waking the Witch,&quot; &quot;Watching You Without Me,&quot; &quot;Jig of Life,&quot; and &quot;Hello Earth&quot;-are more in the line of a single recording from which the individual titles cannot be easily separated.  In these selections, she seems to be telling a story of her dreamlife, capturing the beautiful and fearsome images that come to her in sleep and then awakening to face the new day with the concluding &quot;Morning Fog.&quot;  Throughout the recording, Bush seems considerably less interested in vocal gymnastics than in the past-although &quot;Big Sky&quot; and &quot;Waking The Witch&quot; certainly make good use of her remarkable talents in that direction.  Her voice is full, rich, and sure, and her bursts into extreme displays of range seem less a matter of showmanship than of artistic inevitability.  This is Kate Bush shorn of her eccentricities, and she is every bit as remarkable without them as she was when she gave them full play.<br />Although Bush has always been extremely well regarded in England and in Europe, she was not widely known in the United States, where her recordings were deemed too alternative for the mass market.  With HOUNDS OF LOVE, however, she made a perfect leap into American commercial success, creating a more popular sound without sacrificing any of her uniqueness in the process.  It was and remains a remarkable feat, and even some fifteen years after its release HOUNDS OF LOVE remains as fresh and as compelling as the first day it was recorded.

B000002UB3|5.0|I never thought I'd be saying this, but the \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\"/\\"Polythene Pam\\"/\\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" medley is among the best things the Beatles ever did.  Those three songs encapsulate the entire Abbey Road album: fun, fast, and furious.  The energy that was present in parts of The White Album is in Abbey Road, only here it stretches from beginning to end.<br />The word that comes to mind when thinking about Abbey Road is \\"solid.\\"  This album has some songs that are better than others, but there are no low points like on the aforementioned White Album.<br />Perhaps the best songs among the 17 are the ones that don't make it onto the Blue Album.  \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" along with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Helter Skelter,\\" is among the Beatles' greatest hard rock songs.  \\"Oh! Darling\\" is fantastic, as is \\"You Never Give Me Your Money.\\"  In fact, every song shows the Beatles at the top of their game.<br />Buy this album if you are a fan of the Beatles and do not already own it.  If you are not yet accustomed with the band, start out with the Red Album and the Blue Album (the \\"Best of\\" albums) and eventually work your way to this masterpiece.
B000005GWE|5.0|What happens when you put two great jazz guitarists in the same recording studio? You get \\"I Can See Your House From Here\\". Pat Metheny and John Scofield are different enough guitarists that it really adds to the excitement of this album. Rarely, will you see two masters of the guitar appear like this without trying to upstage each other. All eleven tunes on this album are originals, each writing about half the material. <br />This album is load with lots of great licks, and music. The title track has a good theme to it, which each guitarist takes turns exploring. It nearly crosses the line into free-jazz, and sounds a little spacey. With \\"The Red One\\" they duo is grounded with both feet firmly on the earth. Scofield steps out first to explore his vision of the song. At the halfway mark, Metheny turns on his synth and sounds like a trumpet taking the solo. The solos go back and forth for the whole album, and the guitar work is incredible. Other notables on this album are \\"One Way to Be\\", \\"No Matter What\\" and Message to My Friend\\". <br />This isn't just an album of guitar. Steve Swallow and Bill Stewart join up with bass and drums respectively. Both are fine musician's and are able to provide the beat that the duo play off of. Stewart delivers an excellent drum solo on \\"Everybody's Party\\", that will have you banging the desktop or steering wheel like it was your own little drum kit. <br />If you're a fan of either Scofield or Metheny, this is quite an album to have, and I highly recommend it.

0393316041|5.0|I only wish that I could have taken a class from Richard Feynman.  This is not a book about physics.  It is a book about of the most brilliant physics minds of the last century and a good guy to boot.  It is a book that I have read to my kids (the chapters are each an episode or incident in feynman's life and are hilarious, touching, and insightful).  I can not recommend this book too highly.
6305358567|3.0|This is a lovely movie, Cate Blanchet's performance as the title character is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. The costumes are spectacular.<br />     As others have noted, this film is entertainment, not history.  The writer(s) mixed fact with pure fancy, and compressed many authentic episodes that occured over 40 or so years into the beginning of the reign.  Walsingham did not kill Marie de Guise, nor did he oust Cecil as Elizabeth's primary advisor.  Robert Dudley was not involved in any murder plot.  I won't bore you with the rest of the laundry list.<br />    I think it only fair to point out that in my opinion, despite the inaccuracies, the writer(s) did manage to give a fairly accurate view of some major aspects of Elizabeth I's entire reign.  She did use possible marriage as a political tool.  And she was damned adept at doing so.  Elizabeth did have a more moderate religious policy than either of her two predecessors.<br />The movie is worth watching.  And, if seeing it whets your curiosity, read any of the several popular level biographies of<BR>Elizabeth I. Alison Weir's _The Life of Elizabeth I_ is very well written.
0525946284|5.0|I have just read my first, but definitely not last Ken Follett novel. I received Jackdaws as a Christmas present. What a present it turned it out to be! <br />Jackdaws, based on a true story, needs to be made into a blockbuster movie. It tells the story of how people thrust into dire situations can do amazing things. Felicity Clairet, aka Flick, is a strong main character, operating behind enemy lines in occupied France. On her trail is Dieter Franck, Gestapo agent. What ensues is one of the best cat- and- mouse chases I personally have ever read in modern fiction.<br />During the entirety of the book, I kept saying to myself, This is a master at work! There were several interesting supporting characters. At times you need a card to keep track of these characters, but they are thoroughly believable and well written. <br />This is easily one of my all-time favorite books. Think of The Fugitive during Nazi WWII occupied France and you are getting the idea of just how impressive this novel is!
B000001EC1|5.0|Whether you're an old fan of these guys who grew up to the &quot;party dude!!&quot; rock of &quot;Livin' On a Prayer&quot; or &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; or if you missed out on all that and just happened to see the video for &quot;It's My Life&quot; and are interested, this one is for you.  While it might not capture everything that made the band great (geez, it would probably take up 3 cds), this is a great 14 song collection.  It does a pretty good job of highlighting the band's career and even throws in the title-track from Jon's solo-album &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;.  <br />For the older fans who already own all of the albums, there's two new tracks.  Both &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot; are classic Bon Jovi.  Also, there's an updated, slower version of &quot;Livin On A Prayer&quot;.  Too bad that it's the only weak spot.  Still, it's not bad enough to detract from the rest of the cd.  It's definitely worth buying and it is a lot of fun, whether you're at a party or in your car on your way to work.  Good stuff.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this to anyone only interested in seeing a movie about Pearl Harbor.  It it a sappy story wrapped around a real event.  You must suspend all sense of reality to take in this movie
B00003CXSP|2.0|Let me start by saying that unlike most who have reviewed this film, I am a huge fan of the movie Manhunter.  As far as I am concerned, Michael Mann's adaptation of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon is by far the best of the 3 films based on Harris' novels.  To this day I do not know how Silence won 5 academy awards while Manhunter was completely forgotten.<br />All that being said, I purchased Hannibal at a video rental shop for $10.  I purchased this film mainly to complete my collection of Harris Films.  Now I will tell you that there is no other real reason to purchase this film.<br />Hannibal is the third book in a series of novels by Thomas Harris, all of which feature FBI agent protagonists tracking Serial Killers.  In the film version of Hannibal, Anthony Hopkins reprises his academy award winning role as Hannibal Lecter, believed by basically everyone in Harris' world to be the most dangerous man who has ever lived.  If you loved Hopkins outrageously over-the-top theatrics in Silence, then will still like him in this film.  Hopkin's lecter was apparently perfect the first time around, because he hasn't changed a lick in 10 years.  Julianne Moore takes over the role of naive FBI cadet Clarice Starling, now 10 years into a career at the FBI.  Moore is a very beautiful and talented actress who is completely thrown away in this movie.  Aside from doing a very good Impression of Jodie Foster's accent from Silence, She doesn't figure into this film very much.  Hannibal is basically the story of Lecter's only surviving victim, A mutilated cripple named Mason Verger, who is hunting lecter for revenge.<br />The biggest problem with this film is that it has no substance.  All of the secondary characters are black-and-white cardboard cut-outs without so much as the depth of a kiddie-pool.  We have the Male-chauvanist Justice Dept. rep who is intent on destroying Clarice because she has rejected his sexual advances.  We have the greedy, immoral older policeman in Italy who isforever trying to fulfill the desires of his beautiful young wife and pays the price.  We have the higher-ups at the FBI who crucify Starling immediately upon her very public participation in a wild-west shootout for which she is IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE.  We have the never-ending series of tough, male G-men who insist on treating Starling (who by all rights should be an FBI living legend after the events of silence) like an insipid little girl.  But in the final analysis, what we are missing is the consummation of a formula that has worked in the past, and always will work...in this movie, the guilty are not punished.  Manhunter and Silence work so well because of the fact that they are straightforward morality tales of using a pet monster to catch a monster that is on the loose.  Hannibal Lecter works much better as a dangerous insect under glass who can be consulted when his unique and terrifying knowledge and viewpoint are needed.  In this movie, we have no heroes and no villian.  Is Verger a villian?  It seems to me that twisted as he is, he is bent on doing the world a HUGE favor by ridding it of Lecter.  What we have here is a movie that does not follow the formula of good guys chase bad guy, catch bad guy, and punish bad guy.  The film simply breaks down on multiple levels.<br />Now I've had the discussions with people that this film is all about Lecter and Starling, and their mutual fascination with one another.  If this were the case, they might actually be expected to share more than one scene together.  If this is the story that Harris was trying to tell, either he or the screenwriter failed utterly.<br />OK.  So I have massive problems with the plot and structure of the film.  There is an upside.  This film, like all of Scott's films, is both absolutely gorgeous, and technically wonderful.  If there is a film-maker alive today with a better command of the art of making films look good than Ridley Scott, I could not tell you who that person is.  The sets, locations, costumes, lighting, color, framing, composition, yadda, yadda, etc. are amazing.  This is one of the best looking films of the year.  What a shame that this basically means it is exquisite wrapping paper with an empty box inside.<br />In conclusion, I have to say that as hard as I have been on this film, I did not hate it.  I sat through a film that was pleasant enough, all the while bemoaning the masterpiece that might have been.  In the final analysis, this movie turns out to be a B-movie thriller with an A-list cast, and that is it's final shame.  Unless you saw this movie in the theater and loved it so much that you cannot live without owning it, pass on the DVD.
1878424319|5.0|Having owned this book for 6 months now I have found it to be close by for many readings. This is not a book I have shoved away in my book case! After meditating for some twenty years it bares comparison with the meditation proccess and discipline.Taking the four simple agreements and putting them in place in your own life can certainly make some changes to your own life. How much easier it is to just put people down and add to the negativiy of daily life that so many people in life seem to enjoy. I certainly didnt interpret from Miguel s writing that you lay down and take negativity or be pasive when if you do get punched!. I would imagine if you are in an abusive situation it would be more wise to leave than to react and as pointed out not take it personally and have it affect your emotional state getting you hooked up with the abusers negativity..Although these precepts are simple they are not that easy to put into day to day life .This can hold true with meditation where it can be very hard to keep meditating when we live in a noisy sometimes stressful and distracting world.<br />Meditation is simple and the words of this book are simple but if taken into daily life they can be very powerful and effective tool for you own life.
0441003257|5.0|Phenomenal book.  I actually dropped it several times from laughing so hard.  Two of my favorite authors in one book.  It's a dream come true.
0440219078|4.0|This book....one of the best books ever made. This book is for everyone. This book is for all those who wants to live in another world and the world in this story is wondreful. You NEED to buy this!!!
6302038308|3.0|The crossing of the horror, comedy genres give this movie a spoof like quality. A wacky look at demonic possesion, self mutilation and the ultimate good verses evil story make this film highly enjoyable and will be watched over and over again. Sam Raimis melodramtic macabre images mixed with a comedic twist make this movie totatly hillarious. Bizarre enough to become a cult classic yet entertaining for anyone with a sense of humor.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hello ppl. Well I just got this CD and it rox. LP don't show 'bad' Lyics and there songs dont send 'bad' meggeges eatha. You should really get this CD if ya ask me.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I loved the movie, but when my father gave me the soundtrack CD, I didn't think it was the type of music to which I would listen, but.... I grew weary of what I was listening to at work one day and popped in the OBWAT CD and just let it play over and over and now it's my favorite to listen to while working. &quot;Toe Tappin' Treasure&quot;, as one reviewer described it, is right on the money:)
0446677450|2.0|When you first read through it even as you reach the third chapter, you realize that the author is redundant. He inspires slowly. He tells you that you don't get financial literacy in school but later tells you a chapter later that a valuable lesson his friend learned on  business was when attended a talk as an MBA student in UT-Austin.He tells you to invest only on assets-things that will add to your income then he tells you his wife just bought her dream mercedes.I have a mercedes but I'm still waiting for it to make money for me .Hey , wait! what if I use it as a taxi cab and drive my mercedes?<br />He tells you to own businesses but then explains-that you may not be the type who should start a business. So instead be a venture capitalist and invest in start-ups.Well its 2002 already and we do not know anymore where the hot dot coms are now.<br />He writes about the lessons like invest in stocks (Never advises you which kind of stocks to invest in).Invest in real estate( but never advises which kind or where... Kandahar perhaps?)He tells you to be financially literate over and over but in the end doesn't tell you exactly how. I'm almost halfway through the book when the most meaningful advice I got was a quote from McDonald's chief Ray Kroc.<br />Catchy title,poorly written . I just want my money back
B00005JKMO|1.0|Will Smith's performance was excellent.  But I do regret wasting my money on a movie about a man who refuse to serve his country because of his religious beliefs.  Especially at this time with the events of the past months.  I find it ironic that he refused to enlist because of his beliefs but yet in his personal life he seemed to live it as he saw fit.  Being a member in today's military forces I truely regret every seeing this movie and hope that others will not make the same mistake.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Beach Boys was a name given not by the group but a DJ. This album shows they weren't just another pop band, but that they had greatness about them. They shedaway the false skin of just a surf band, and show part of their would beyond the beach. They way I came acrossed this album says much to it's credit. I had heard many beach boys songs and had a mental list of my favorites, but didn't own any albums. I off the cuff bought a greatest hits CD, liked it but it was missing something. I vowed the next time to do more research. As I looked I found Pet Sounds, and was surprised that my mental list of favorites was there for the most part in one album. Sloop John B has always resonated with something deep in my soul past understanding into the essence of feeling. Kudos, to a sucessful experiment.
B000001G89|3.0|While this is a good performance of this great opera it suffers from the fact that a number of &quot;liberties&quot; are taken with the libretto. Abbado's version of Carmen (as is far too often the case in operatic performance) is based on an abridged and mutilated text. It is unfortunate that so many conductors (or record executives?) continue to issue performances of operas in such a historically perverse form.
B00005R87Q|4.0|I've seen better action/suspense movies, but this is still very good. If you like cars of any sort, it's for you. Paul Walker plays a great role, as well as Vin Diesel. However, kids ages nine and down shouldn't see it, with the exception of a few parts. I wouldn't exactly rush to see it, but you should watch it whenever you can.
B00003CY5J|1.0|I saw this movie with a friend, both of us having the expectation of a suspenseful movie.  The only suspense found was trying to remember how much longer I would be stuck in the movie.  It is a very bad sign to leave a movie feeling that a ticket to Jurassic Park III would have been a better investment.

0671024256|4.0|Stephen King is a fascinating man, and I enjoy hearing his opinions, watching interviews on TV, etc.  Unfortunately, I do not care much for his fiction; that is because of his choice of plots, not the quality of his writing.  Fortunately, his memoir On Writing focusses on the tools of writing that cross all the subgenres of fiction.  Any aspiring writer will benefit from this book.<br />Two themes crop up continuously, and these are very valuable pieces of wisdom to aspiring writers: 1. Read a lot.  Paradoxically, the more you read, the less likely you are to duplicate another's ideas and find a style/story all your own.  2. Edit mercilessly.  King is especially critical of adverbs (yes, I am aware of the irony in including an adverb in this sentence!), telling writers to expunge them everywhere.  Just like editting a film, everything that isn't critical to the story should be eliminated.  This is difficult for young writers to do, but the sooner they learn to be critical of their own writing, the better.<br />Also included is a brief biography of King himself.  Like a number of other famous writers, illness played a key role in his childhood; in addtion, such factors as unpleasant sitters, an impoverished family life, and a brother with a 160 IQ helped influence King's writing.  The bio is interesting and illuminating, but not as useful as the technical parts of the book.<br />Thus, I would recommend this to anyone as an interesting and thought-provoking examination of the craft of writing, whether or not you are an aspiring writer.  While the focus is primarily on contemporary, non-scientific fiction, most of the advice offered is good for all fiction writers (and often for those writing non-fiction as well).
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams is probably one of the most audacious entertainers out there today ... and God bless him for it. &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; is a classy affair. He takes a risk and pulls it off with panache. His voice sounds great, the orchestrations are sumptuous ... each of the tracks are a gem. <br />Some highlights: &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot; duet w/Nicole Kidman, &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot; 'duet' with Ol' Blue Eyes himself, &quot;Well Did You Evah&quot; duet w/Jon Lovitz, &quot;Things&quot; duet (there are lots of duets on this album) with Jane Horrocks, and &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me&quot; with Rupert Everett.<br />This album won't appeal to all of his fans. There isn't a single pop track on the album. But it may win over a few new ones...<br />As ever with Robbie, like him or hate him, there's no denying this guy is an entertainer through and through.
B000007T1M|5.0|System Of A Down's self titled debut album is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.It took me a fews listens to relize this,when I first heard it I was like whats this.But I wasn't ready to give up on it after all the good things I had heard about it.So I listened a couple more times and I came to like it so much it was constantly in my cd player I had it for about a year and still like it.The best songs are suite pee,sugar suggestions,spiders,soil,and war(the best song ever) but thats just my opinion you decide for yourself.I highly recomend to everyone so check it out you wont be dissapionted
B00003CXTG|5.0|Forget what the critics say and enjoy &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; for what it is ... a stirring cinematic epic that hearkens back to the old wartime love stories of the 40s and 50s. Sure, it has its moments of &quot;cheese&quot; but all in all, you can't get better entertainment. And the attack sequence at the heart of the film is some of the most gripping film-making I've seen in a very long time.<br />Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsale have their effective moments. Alec Baldwin growls it up as Doolittle. Jon Voight makes a remarkable FDR. And the visuals are absolutely stunning.<br />It's entertainment. Now tell me, in comparison, why was such an offensively bad film as &quot;Titanic&quot; heralded as a masterpiece when &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is blasted by critics? I think its purely  Hollywood politics.
B000002VC3|4.0|Be aware, this review is coming from someone who is not the biggest Alan Parsons Project fan, although I do like Tales of Mystery &amp; Imagination, I Robot, and Pyramid. Although to me, I prefer I Robot, Eye in the Sky has some great stuff. The opening cut is a wonderful instrumental called &quot;Sirius&quot;, you've probably heard this song plenty of times if you've watched your share of basketball games and sports broadcasts. It's done in the classic APP style with synthesizers and orchestration. The title track is the biggest hit here, as everyone heard it one the radio. Not my favorite APP cut, particularly because I'm not all that fond of Eric Woolfson's voice (his singing always seems to be overly dramatic) but still not bad. I also think &quot;Children of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Gemini&quot;, &quot;Psychobabble&quot;, and the instrumental &quot;Mammagamma&quot; are great cuts. I especially like the vocal arrangements of &quot;Gemini&quot;, it even got compared to Gentle Giant. But there is a couple of cuts I don't seem to care for that much. One is the rather dumb &quot;You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned&quot;, the one Lenny Zakatek sings, although he doesn't have that overly dramatic style of Woolfson, he still has a rather annoying quality. I also think the highly orchestrated &quot;Silence and I&quot; seems to be rather mediocre to my ears, although they were attempting to be progressive here. The other heavily orchestrated piece, &quot;Old and Wise&quot; (sung by ex-Zombies Colin Bluntstone) works better here. What's really strange was the album states it was recorded digitally, but it sounds very analog to my ears (it hardly sounds like those digitally recorded albums from the mid 1980s). Heck the band still sounded like they hadn't even got out of the 1970s, and even though it was released in 1982, it sounds like it could have been made around 1977 or 1978 (even though it was probably recorded around 1981 and early 1982). Eye in the Sky seems to be theProject's least synth dominated album, aside from Tales of Mystery and Imagination, of course. But at this point, I noticed the Alan Parsons Project sound was starting to get a little pale, so they decided to let the '70s go after this album, by adding drum machines and digital synths, but to me, those albums (like Vulture Culture, Stereotomy, etc.) simply fall flat. Still, Eye in the Sky isn't bad, but in my opinion, the Project's best album is I Robot.
B000000WF0|5.0|Verve; spirit, energy, enthusiasm that animates an artist<br />Hymn; a song of praise, to God but also to a Nation - to celebrate in song<br />Urban; belonging to a city<br />If you want to have an understanding of this album you couldn't do better than to look at the title of the record and the name of the band.<br />The 13 remarkable songs are also hymns, celebrations dedicated to us all (especially the disenfranchised youth), performed with boundless spirit and energy by arguably the most prolific rock band of the past decade. This is the third and final album from The Verve, which makes Urban Hymns all the more important, important for us to embrace and most importantly, to not forget.
B00005QK3D|4.0|If you're looking for a return to the old Helloween thrash sound, you won't find it here.  But you will find some very sound metal that is not afraid to experiment with traditionally non-metal influences.  Depart Kai Hansen and enter Roland Grapow.  With Roland's bluesy influences, they've expanded their sound quite a lot, especially on the bluesy accoustic title track, and bluesy rocker &quot;I'm Doing Fine, Crazy Man&quot; (which is lyrically reminiscent of old Anthrax).  &quot;Your Turn&quot; is an incredible blend of blues, country and metal sounds, and Michi's angelic voice resulting in a power ballad like no other.  Of course, this CD isn't without a good dose of blistering metal.  The anthemic &quot;Kids of the Century&quot; will rolick through your brain long after the song ends, &quot;Someone's Crying&quot; harkens back to the Walls of Jericho sound, and the heavy keyboard orchestrations really play well with the driving metal guitars on &quot;Mankind&quot;.  In a genre of music that is so overdone with dark, evil, and satanic imagery, Helloween stands apart, fighting the &quot;good fight&quot; with spiritually uplifting messages (which has earned them accusations of being a Christian band) and a healthy dose of good humor -- &quot;Heavy Metal Hamsters&quot; takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the metal genre, and &quot;Number One&quot; (which is musically a turning point for the band, with its electronic pop sound, a sound that would be recreated later on Chameleon) is one of the most spiritual pieces of music ever penned, not unlike &quot;Believe&quot; (from Chameleon) and &quot;Don't Run For Cover&quot; (from The Best, The Rest, The Rare).  This, ultimately, would be the next to last album for both Michi (who departed after Chameleon to pursue a solo career) and Ingo (R.I.P.).  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|The best review of this album is held in the meaning of the title:<br />Gold; anything very precious or noble, one of the rare metals<br />Rock is so desperate to find the next Dylan, Petty or Springsteen that the establishment is naming every year a talent who will change the world. Of course, the hype fades away and all is left is a modest talent. The thing with Ryan Adams is that all the hype, all the critical kudos and admiring fans is right on cue. He is, without doubt, a song to sing about. He is precious, he is rare, and we would all be very stupid to take our eyes off him.<br />Gold, bombastic and flawed, is exactly what I expected after Heartbreaker. Crammed with songs thickly instrumented Adams takes the listener on a voyage through the history of American rock (but just like the upside down American flag on the cover, he adds a few surprises). His songwriting and singing alludes to the finest rock artists of the past century but leaves us with a taste that is all his own.<br />He writes songs effortlessly, and when performing live he is as relaxed as the audience, cracking jokes, telling stories, creating a relationship between us and him, making the music that little bit more human and personal.<br />Gold is not a masterpiece as some blindly claim it to be. Think that and you will be disappointed. It is though a very, very good album, and I recommend it highly. Ryan Adams. Do not forget his name!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Maybe the best film to ever come out of the american indie scene.  You really can't experience this film properly outside of the theater, and it's better not knowing anything about it beforehand.  But still, it's well worth getting on DVD.  I recommend you experience it as a whole, in one sitting, and don't try to figure out what will happen/has happened.  It is an extremely re-watchable film, but do allow it to sink in after the first time, and think about it.  That's the point....
B000001FI7|4.0|I bought this album after reading all of the reveiws on amazon,I was kind of disappointed after skipping through all but ten tracks until I got to \\"Glory Box\\", I geuss I was expecting deep,dark, sinister sounds of Mezzanine, I don't know If I would call this Trip-Hop, More like Sade joined Massive Attack. Laid back and cool. The best song by far is \\"Glory Box\\". I think it's worth buying on the strength of this track alone.I'm a man but I felt this woman's pain.Beth's voice is as smooth as honey. She expresses so much emotion through her vocals.She is one of the best vocalist I've heard in a long time. Great Cd just don't expect Massive Attack trip hop. Expect smooth laid back Jazz style with a touch of bass.I also recommend Sade-Lover's Rock for some smooth chill music.I hope this helps somebody
B00005LC1H|4.0|The writing by John Cleese and Connie Booth is excellent.  The cast is almost always great: delivery, timing, etc.  The humor for some may be an acquired taste (e.g., the negativism and minor violence may turn some people off).  Overall, it's very high-quality farce, of a level rarely seen on weekly television!<br />I'm a big fan of John Cleese, and his interviews are very interesting (informative, analytical, etc.).  One disappointment is that Connie Booth was not interviewed.<br />The directors speak of the simplicity of today's digital editing, but it obviously wasn't used in the production of these DVDs (e.g., to remove the green flashes and other defects; to erase the boom shadows the directors kept pointing out).  However, the visual quality is very watchable as is.<br />MY BIG COMPLAINT is with the AUDIO COMMENTARIES (first six by John Howard Davies, second six by Bob Spiers).  After watching the first commentary, I hoped they would fix the audio problems for the second episode; after watching the first six episodes, I hoped someone knowledgeable would improve the sound for the second director -- no such luck.  ... <br />A second problem is that the original audio level is either too low or completely off during the commentaries (maybe so that no personal sounds are missed ;-).  The saving grace is that you can have the subtitles on, plus they programmed properly (unlike too many DVDs) so that the remote's audio button works.<br />In general, I love audio commentaries.  I've heard worse content (e.g., when a producer who had nothing to do with creative decisions hogs a commentary, saying nothing more than \\"isn't that great\\" about everything).  The first director was often lacking information -- following the trend of many poor commentaries where the commentator just wings it, not having seen or thought about the material in years.  He had to be censored several times (note the poorly worded apology inserted into the DVD packaging).  One memorable inappropriate comment left in, after praising Connie Booth for her writing and other abilities, was when he said the best thing about Connie Booth is her legs.  Then during the scene where she goes braless, he was censored for a long period (I wonder what he said).  The second director had more information, although sometimes redundant, but his personal sounds were even more disgusting.  Blow your nose before you begin, drink without slurping, don't chain smoke and smack your phlegm while you're trying to communicate, and stop playing with yourself!<br />Despite the problems, the DVD set is worth purchasing.
B0000009SF|5.0|I can't think about this album without remembering the intermission while watching the tour.  Needing bodily relief, I braved the men's room and when I finally got my chance at the stall, moaned: &quot;Blessed Relief&quot; (one of the album's song titles).  Immediately, the fellow standing next to me exclaimed: &quot;Eat that Question!&quot; (another song title from the album) and the whole place erupted in laughter.  Frank may not have had the largest following, but we were serious fans and we still are.<br />This disc is amazing from many viewpoints.  It was a step further into fusion for the band, maybe we should call it fusion with a sense of humor.  Read the liner notes for clues.  Considering when it was recorded, the sound quality is excellent.  The entire album is fluid from front to back so it's hard to pick favorite tracks but I guess Cletus Awreetus Awrightus and the title track are my favorite two.  This is a great disc to listen to late at night, with the lights low or out.  The percussion floats in space, as do the horns.  I can still get lost in the cymbals and the overall ambience.  It's biggest fault is that it was too short but at the time, Frank kept his LP sides short in order to improve dynamics and reduce crosstalk on vinyl.  Too bad he didn't extend this to a 2-LP set.<br />Essential stuff, don't miss it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|If you are an open minded individual forget all the critics and narrow minded reviews.  Most of the critics need to brush up on their American history in the first place.  Watch the movie, then watch the &quot;Unsung Heros&quot; which a bonus feature on the second disk. I think most people will be pleasantly surprised at how much research and thought actually went into the movie.  Yes there is a love story but don't most movies add a little fluff to the facts?  That's what keeps you interested.  You will feel like you know the characters by the end of the movie and I think that was the point.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Besides the action and the [pretty] girls, the movie accurtately shows street racing to the core.  For those who are interested in cars you should simply enjoy watching the nice souped up cars that flash accross the screen every two seconds.  I'm sure research was done thoroughly to make every auto mechanical detail realistic as possible.  The part where the mechanic talks about the legendary Japanese tuner \\"Spoon\\" shows just that.  Many of the information described about the car tuning is only available in Japan at the moment, where all of this import car tuning craze started.  Sources such as the popular Japanese \\"Best MOTORing\\" video series must have been fully studied to get every detail down to the point.  Being a car fanatic myself I was most impressed with the technical accuracy of the movie rather than the big explosions.  The weak story can be compromised since I was fully satisfied by the other before mentioned aspects.
B00005U2LM|2.0|By the low standards set by the other rappers out there right now, this is certainly not a bad album.  By Wu's standards (at least, the standards of 36 Chambers and the first round of solo albums), this is more mediocre, boring, repetitive, uncreative fluff.  Some of the beats are good, but none of the hooks are as original and memorable as any of their early stuff.  &quot;Y'all been warned&quot;.  Unfortunately I've been warned that the Wu can't write a creative hook anymore.<br />I guess that's the keyword: memorable.  This album is OK to listen to.  But none of the songs are true classics.  Uzi is a very good song, but it would have been about the 7th or 8th best song on 36 Chambers.  <br />Can we please go back to the days when Wu Tang still made an effort?  I guess when cash rules everything around rap, and the Wu has a fan base that will buy whatever they put out, those days may be over.  It's a damn shame, too, because at one point they were looking like they could become one of the best rap groups ever.
0380789019|3.0|Neil Gaiman, Neverwhere (Avon, 1996)<br /><br />Gaiman took the script from his own miniseries and novelized it, and that's where many of the problems with this volume lay. While the plot moves along at a fine enough pace, and the pages turn quickly, there's not really much in the way of development going on. The characters are 2-D all the way through, and we never get to feeling that there's more than that surface. So if you're a person who can't find anything worth liking in a novel with badly-drawn characters, this probably shouldn't be the first place you turn when looking for something to read.<br /><br />On the other hand, if a well-realized plot and some great place descriptions are enough to make you eschew characterization, you could do a lot worse. Gaiman is quite good at coming up with new and interesting places to send his characters, most of which obviously started with the question &quot;why in the world was this tube station named &lt;x&gt;?&quot; Gaiman creates an alternate London that's quite a bit of fun to explore. I just can't quite shake the feeling that the miniseries would be more absorbing than the book. ***
B000002UA0|5.0|Get this to hear what Pink Floyd sounded like in the years of swinging London! It's the best non-Beatles psychedelia I've ever heard. The kaleidoscopic cover pretty much says it all, as we're given an acid-dropper's view of the galaxy through the story-book head-in-the-clouds songwriting of Syd Barrett, who wrote none of the subsequent Pink Floyd albums. Listen at the end of &quot;Bike&quot; for some strange sound effects reminiscent of the wraparound nonsense at the end of SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, a contemporary of this work.
B00003CXAA|3.0|I bought this collection hoping for some excellent bonus material. What I got was a few deleted scenes, some behind the scenes material and a LAME &quot;family tree&quot; that briefly tells you about the family, but nothing more about them that could be learned by watching all 3 movies. Where is the background on the other important characters in the movie? Where is the background on the book? I was looking for a story or information about the real family. Even network TV took the trilogy and pieced it together into chronological order. I thought that version may have been one of the extras. I expected so much more from a box set that was supposed to be so good.
B00001OH7N|5.0|This entry from early in Bowie's most creative period sounds a lot like Black Sabbath, so if you're into that kind of heavy, excessive doom-rock, get this!  There's also Bowie's usual gratuitous strangeness, as in &quot;All the Madmen&quot; and &quot;The Supermen&quot; and what, to my knowledge, is the only Vietnam song he ever recorded - &quot;Running Gun Blues.&quot;  Glam divinity runs rampant!
B00005U122|5.0|After discovering roger waters and pink floyd around 1983 l have had many years of listening to the music, now finaly we can see  waters and the great band he has put together playing all the songs we now so well. Not only is it a great show but its over 2 hours long.After seeing this show on dvd we have booked a trip to Australia (as he is not coming to NEW ZEALAND) in april to see Waters live - in the flesh, Beleve me this is a must buy for the DVD collection for any music fan. &quot;Even the wife liked it&quot;
B00005N9CV|5.0|I've been looking for a great new singer for more years than I'd like to reveal, but Krall is it.  She daringly walks the line between singing and speaking, putting personal touches in her style but not getting mushy or maudlin.  Minimalist is how I'd put it, admirably minimalist, like the unaffected but incredibly cool young Chet Baker, but with the musicality of Matt Dennis.  And the arrangements - restrained, subtle, extraordinarily apt to the song; and here are some of the great American songs.  Top notch!
0671027573|5.0|When the book ended I wanted to know where the sequel was!  I really loved the characters of Jaine and Sam and the verbal bantering between them (as well as the more steamy encounters!)  I was not really surprised by the who dunnit but there was a twist that did come as a surprise.  While I might have liked a bit more insight into the villain, it was really Sam and Jaine I wanted more of, so the day after I finished the book I read it  over again, and that is something I have NEVER done before!  I am now on my 3rd reading of the Sam and Jaine parts of the book.  I also enjoyed the closeness of the friendship between the four women, and that Jaine was no helpless victim, she was a strong yet flawed woman, very real to me.  This was my first Linda Howard book but it won't be my last.
0393312836|3.0|Part of the my 3 star rating is probably due to the lack of a character to identify with in this book.  I think that, for one, made the book much more difficult to truly get into.<br />Most obnoxious however is the slang language used by the teens of the book.  It was good idea as a device to help take the reader to another time and place, but let's get real...words like bezoomny, slooshy, and klootch may be taking it a bit too far.  I found them distracting.<br />On the positive side, the book does a great job of raising a potentially realistic social issue.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album is a watershed work in the long, twisted history of hard, genuine rock and roll.<br />Why do people listen to rock and roll? It all comes down to the raw emotionally expressive power of the electric guitar. This album has that in spades. 'Sister Ray' is still probably the longest and best pure noise freak-out ever committed to vinyl-- loud, abrasive and full of a inner emotional logic. It's the rock and roll answer to Ornette Coleman's Free Jazz and probably one of those seminal tracks that everyone serious about music needs to hear but might not hear.<br />Anyway, the tracks on this album can blow you away. The title track is one of the best first tracks ever. 'I Heard Her Call My Name' has a genius distorted lead guitar that melts your speakers and the scuzzy propulsive power of Moe Tucker and John Cale anchoring it.<br />All in all, great album for any serious rock fan. ESSENTIAL LISTENING FOR ANY PUNK OR INDY FANS.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I had almost counted No Doubt out, I loved Tragic Kingdom, but Return to Saturn was disappointing...but Rock Steady proves No Doubt is back and hotter than ever. This album is so much fun. I love the whole CD from beginning to end it's awesome. It just puts you in a great mood and the words are catchy and the music is pumping. <BR>I read some very bad reviews of this album, but I really disagree, the songs do have the same feel, but to consider them all the same is not giving them enough credit. <br />This is not a deeply thought provoking and lyric heavy album but I've never expected that from No Doubt. What I do expect is some really fun music and that's what this is.
0446678430|1.0|ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR WHO BELIEVES THAT BEING RICH IS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT.THIS BOOK IS LIKE HIS OTHERS IN WHICH IT EXPLAINS WHY HAVING MONEY AND THINGS MEANS BEING HAPPY. LOOK AT THE BACK COVER OF THE BOOK AND YOU WILL SEE A MAN WHO WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT HAVING MONEY MEANS LIVING A GRAND LIFE. MONEY IS NICE BUT IT'S NOT EVERYTHING THAT THIS AUTHOR WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE IT IS, IF YOU FOLLOW HIS PHILOSOPHY. IF YOU ARE EXTERNALLY MOTIVATED THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WHAT'S INSIDE IS WHAT MATTERS THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's &quot;Room for Squares&quot; hasn't really left my CD player since my friend gave me the album as a Christmas gift. It's so great and each song is both catchy and thought provoking. <BR>Mayer's music is great for young people like myself, I'm 19 and a freshman in college, and this CD expresses all the feelings you have at this age. That bridge between being a kid and an adult and choosing to live your own life and the outcomes of that. It makes me feel less alone and I don't find a song I don't relate too. Subjects range from love to heading out alone to experiencing life for yourself.<BR>My favorite songs:<BR>&quot;No Such Thing&quot;- which really shows that bridge between high school and the real world, when you realize there is no such thing as the real world<BR>&quot;Why Georgia&quot;- this is my most favorite, it's about heading out on your own and questioning the choices you make, &quot;am I living it right?&quot;<BR>&quot;City Love&quot;- this is a great love song about all the little things in relationships<BR>&quot;3x5&quot;- the point is you have to live life for yourself, don't try and fit life into a picture frame<BR>This is truly a great CD, I highly recommend it to all young people and really anyone. It's kind of like DMB but reminds me a lot of Mike Willis if any of you know him.<BR>Buy this CD!
B00005QDW1|4.0|So, if one were to read most of the reviews for this CD on this site, the big question becomes apparent: have No Doubt sold out?  I don't think so.  Yes, they started out as a straightforward ska band.  This sound is covered on their debut album &quot;No Doubt&quot; and &quot;The Beacon Street Sessions&quot; (albums which, curiously, no one mentions in their reviews).  They took a slight turn into more rock/pop territory with &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; but they were still very ska-influenced.  &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot; then went even further into rock/pop territory, being much darker than &quot;Kingdom&quot; and all but jettisoning their ska sound altogether.  Now, here they are with a VERY '80s pop/synth sound melded with hardcore reggae/rocksteady/dub sounds.  And, I personally think it's a good fit - possibly an improvement over &quot;Saturn.&quot;  Why do I feel this way?  Well, ALL of the musical genres this band dabbles in are of an '80s vintage.  And, to those who complain they aren't a ska band anymore, well, don't you see the relation between the ska movement and the forms of West Indian music used here (reggae, rockseady, etc.)?  This band was ALWAYS pretty poppy, so I don't feel that's changed much.  All in all, I think this style of music is a very good fit for them (for at least one album, anyway).  And, as is obviously not as evident as it should be, this is a total &quot;party/dance&quot; album.  There are a couple of weak tracks but the winners far outweigh the losers.  The quality, I feel, goes up and down depending on which producer is at the helm, the Sly &amp; Robbie tracks probably being the best.  The lyrics ARE very simplistic, but you don't want to clutter peoples' heads up too much when your trying to get them to shake their ass.  Gwen's singing is as sexy as usual and Tony gets ample room to play an especially funky bass.  Also, if you were to substitute Gwen's vocals on this CD for a West Indian man, many of these tracks could pass forgood-quality, hardcore rocksteady dance tracks straight from Jamaica.  When any band becomes flushed with success, everyone wants to line up and take a shot at them.  So, some of the criticism is a bit harsh in my opinion.  I think it's a fine CD with some nice hooks that will simply not vacate your head.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is an action pacted movie, with all the excitement of Gone in 60 Seconds.  If you like films about fast cars,and adventure, you'll love this.  This shows what a great actor Vin Diesel is and how he is going to come strong on the scene.  The cars portrayed in this movie are beautiful and exciting, for women it is a exciting way to enjoy the race scene, and for men it is just plain enjoyable.  I recommend this movie to everyone, young and old alike.
6305095442|5.0|Evil Dead 2 is by far the best of the trilogy, and its the comedy of the movie that makes it so.  The first Evil Dead was a straight forward horror movie that was loaded with gore galore.  Evil Dead 2 is really a remake of the original with better effects, better acting, and somewhat better story.  There isn't as much gore as there is in the original, but the blood flows and flies everywhere, sometimes with hilarious results.  When Ash's hand takes a mind of its' own is one of the funniest segments I've ever seen in a movie, and naturally Bruce Campbell is perfect as the hapless hero.  Do yourself a favor, even if you don't like horror movies pick up the entire Evil Dead trilogy, you'll be laughing out loud while you cringe in disgust.  Also highly recommended is Bad Taste.
B000002U8G|5.0|I've seen a few reviews here talking about the cover art.  It's not some amorphous blob of colour.  It's an ear.  Sorry to spoil the mystery, but I thought it was obvious.
0553801481|5.0|Even before I began this book I had high expectations, since it is by Robin Hobb who has never written a book that disappoints, and Fool's Errand proved to be no exception. The story does begin at a slow pace, but it is still interesting as Fitz's past fifteen years are revealed, pedal by pedal. Then the action builds upon more action until I could not bear to put the book down. Much sleep has been lost reading Fool's Errand, but it was more than worth it. All the characters are real with breathtaking details, and Fitz has to be the one of the most fleshed out protagonists ever. He leaps off the page as a person so real with all his triumphs and tragedies, all of his strengths, and right down to even single one of his faults. At times Fool's Errand had me laughing out loud, and at other times I cried, literally, and for moments on end I could not look at the page without my eyes welling up and my throat clenching. Seldom do books make me do either one, and never have I read one before that has made me do both. <br />If you do not real Fool's Errand you will be missing out on something, and you will never know what until you have read it. It is a story of the highest caliber. Not only does it entertain, but it also speaks of great truths in human kind without preaching, and makes one see life in a whole new manor. I cannot offer anything but the highest praise for Fool's Errand, for it deserves nothing less.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I would prefer to have a soundtrack with the stars that sang the songs in the film, singing them on the CD.  While I appreciate the other musicians that are on the CD, it is just not what I wanted.  The songs on the CD are just not the same as from the film.  I would have prefered both versions on &quot;Come What May&quot; as they were sung in the film.  I also would have prefered, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; sung as it was in the film.  I just think they could have done a better job with the CD considering this was an amazing film.  Hearing the music in the film is what you want to hear on the CD, and it is very disappointing that it isn't.  But, I gave it a three rating because I love both Ewan and Nicloes recordings and it is too bad that we couldn't have heard the enitre cast performance of &quot;Come What May&quot;.  If youare hoping to hear on the CD what you heard in the film, buy the ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE soundtrack, and not this one.
1556154844|5.0|I recieved this book for Christmas as the sort of wanted, but not wanted gift.  Then I started reading it.  My coding ways have changed completely, and I feel that I actually have a better grip on programming than I ever have before.  <br />This is quite possibly the best book, and no doubt the most informative, on coding ways and methods.  Definatly a great volume for any level of coder.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|As an avid fan of rock and pop music, and being at an age where I can actually remember 1973, this movie is absolutely one of my favorites. I think I've watched it 5 times, and could watch it another 5...or 6...or...you get the idea. Cameron Crowe nailed the time period, the music, and the total feeling of the rock scene circa 1973 as well as his intent to give something memorable back to those who gave so generously to him in his youth. I enjoyed the &quot;Untitled&quot; version of the movie, though could see why come of it was left out of the theatrical release. Like Russell Hammond says in one of the restored scenes...&quot;It's all about what you leave out.&quot; Though he's talking about music, I thought the comment to be a little ironic. But I digress. I'll probably buy more of his movies because this one definitely said ALOT to me. I've even gone out and bought some of the movies Cameron mentions in the Director's Commentary of &quot;Untitled&quot;...those being &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot; just because I have such a great respect for Crowe after seeing his passion for both music and the art of film making through this movie. Jerry McGuire was good, but this movie absolutely ROCKS!!
0525945636|3.0|I've read most of Follett's earlier books and truly enjoyed them, but I do not think he took much time to research the time period for this book nor the culture of the time. My biggest gripe is the dialogue--it is too British, and I do not believe swearing so easily slipped off the tongue in 1941 and 1958 as Follett delivers it in the dialogue--especially from ladies. We had a much more polite society in the U.S. back then than we do now. Manners were important, even if only for show.<br />Follett's ealier novels such as The Man from St. Petersburgh, and The Key to Rebecca were much better researched. One glaring error in this book was his description of &quot;sandspur grass&quot; with grass blades that slashed at the ankles. Not so--snadspurs may be from a grass, a weed actually, but the spurs are the seeds that stick into or onto just about anything that touches them. They can be very painful. I know, I am from Florida, and I hated sandspurs as a kid.<br />I think Follett was so successful as an author in his earlier works that he doesn't pay as much attention to it anymore and only produces something that will sell when he needs to pad his bank account a bit more. Too bad. <br />Even so, it is an entertaining read to pass the time with.
0792833201|5.0|I like this movie even though some things in it really freaked me out, it's nice to know that I'm not the only person who got freaked out by that stuffed clown! Poltergeist is a good film though and despite the stuffed clown I would buy the movie on vhs or dvd.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney proved with her second album that she's a talented girl.<br />Sure, most of the songs on this album sound a lot alike, but she did a good job singing them.  My personal faves from this album are:  Stronger, Lucky, What You See, &amp; Dear Diary.<br />Dear Diary was actually written by Britney.  Some people may think that it's just sappy stuff, but I totally identify with the whole 'liking a boy, but being scared' thing.  I mean, I think most teens can.<br />This is a great CD, and I think you should go out and buy it...especially if you love Brit!
B000002UAF|5.0|My Mom has this Beatles CD and I really like it, it has a lot of wonderful songs that I never get tired of listening to and I really recommend this wonderful CD! I have never seen the movie and will have to try and rent it some time.
B00005T343|3.0|I absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs, so I was highly looking forward to Hannibal.<br />And when I first saw it, I was less than thrilled.  I'm not saying that it's horrible...it's just...not that good.<br />You take Julianne Moore (who isn't as good as Jodie Foster) and the incredible Anthony Hopkins, who are both terrific actors, and you put them in a movie that is less than stellar.<br />Hannibal is filled with too much gore, distasteful innuendos, and a horrible plot.  It could be difficult to follow for some.  Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece, but Hannibal slanders the name masterpiece.<br />If you truly love suspense, you will NOT like this movie...However, if you're into the whole blood/guts thing, you'll probably love this movie.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE album wether your a Michael Jackson fan or not! You've most deffinately got the origional THRILLER album but I'd say its deffinately worth getting the Special Edition Thriller too, with bonus tracks, lyrics and unseen photos its a Must have ! Michael Jackson is the most talented person on the planet and this special edition THRILLER is FANTASTIC !

0448060191|5.0|The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel.  It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through.  The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face.  Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end.  This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away.  This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives.  The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them.  This story shows the true meaning of love between a family.
B00004RHZU|4.0|This debut album from Pink is definitely spunky and shows that this girl is truly...well, a girl.  She's not afraid to show off her insanity and her spunk and her attitude.  I think that that is what makes this album absolutely incredible!
B000006TRV|4.0|While I truly enjoyed The Wall, it is obvious that this was not a colaberative album.  This is mostly a work of Roger Waters, which I believe slightly taints the album.<br />This is a very popular album and a good album for new Floyd fans, but after listening to this album, one should hear Floyd at their best in &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;
0446678430|4.0|WOW!  This is probably the best of all of them because he discusses leverage.  In addition, he also discusses how all of are groomed to become employees and to have others (employers and the government) take care of us.  However, 100 hundred years ago, most people were small business owners (my great grandfather owned several gas stations), so we do have it in us.  Kiyosaki talks about 9 out of 10 businesses failing and to know that going in, but the one that makes it will be very rewarding.  Assess the reward and the risks.  Losing is a part of winning.  It is in sports and the game of life.  A little repetive from some of his previous books, but it just helps to reinforce the information, since this is outside the reality of most people's minds and repetition is the mother of learning.
B000059XUO|5.0|...no trailers. If this is the definitive version I want trailers. The lack of DD5.1 is also a problem. You get a DTS track and a Dolby Surround track but no DD. What's the problem? You can remix it for DTS but not DD?<br />Anyway, the deleted scenes are pretty cool. The commentary is lame 'cause the producer takes credit for *everything* in the movie.<br />Otherwise this is a good movie &amp; the transfer is awesome.
B00003CWL6|1.0|What is wrong with you sick bastards for praising this garbage?
B00005RYP7|3.0|My three-star rating is perhaps a bit generous, but I thought it was fairer than two stars, because this movie does deliver some real suspense. Every time a young actress today starts out delightfully innocent, it seems she has to be soon corrupted (or fade into oblivion). Wasn't Leelee Sobieski wonderfully sweet and lovable in DEEP IMPACT? Her innocence survived and still shone, albeit with a put-upon edge in NEVER BEEN KISSED. Then with Leelee the seemingly obligatory squandering came with exceptional harshenss and gratuitousness. In a seemingly pointless bit part disjunct from the rest of the movie, she suffered that perverse rite of passage in EYES WIDE SHUT. Ever since then, her characters seem stuck with a definite element of sniveling brat, never wholly rendered palatable even by heavy put-upon plot elements, such as playing a terminally ill character in HERE ON EARTH, or playing a victim of a plot most sinister in the present movie. The movie title is a double entendre; Glass is both a prominent material in the title house's construction and the surname of its occupants. Mr. and Mrs. Glass are the Godparents of Ruby, Leelee's character. They become her guardians after her parents die in a car crash. Mr Glass is played by Soren Starsgaard, who, if not already in danger of becoming typecast, certainly is after this movie. What are we to make of him? Early on we see him being beaten up by some obviously unsavory characters (loan sharks as it turns out). How if at all does this begin to reveal the plot's central tension? Not in a way completely palatable to me. There may end up being overkill in some plot elements. And the finally evolving central tensions may complete eclipse and overwhelm what looked at first central, so that the earlier tension is forgotten. I wanted a bit more of things being what they seemed at the right places, with no plot twist so overwhelming as to demand that I forget a former one. But if your tastes are different and those objectionsmatter little or none to you, then you might find this a quite satisfying thriller building up to a taut climax.
B00005NTJK|5.0|For you real Tull fans, this album is just like the original, but sounds better and contains four other tracks.  You might be surprised not to see &quot;Teacher&quot; as track 8.  That is because in the original release (1970) &quot;Teacher&quot; was not on it.  &quot;Alive and Living Well&quot; was track 3 and Inside was track 8.  The UK mix of &quot;Teacher&quot; is exactly the same as the original cd release.  So if you like the album, Benefit, and you want it but you want it to sound better, than buy this album.  Hey, Ian Anderson, when are you going to release the rest of the Tull Cd's remastered?  For example, Songs from the Wood, Passion Play.
B00005R87Q|3.0|This movie had really fantastic racing scenes from the beginning to the end, but i found the acting a little too chessy and extremely horrible. I am truly disappointed that the director rob cohen didn't spend a little more time with the dialogue of the movie and just focused more on the racing and action part of the movie. But since this movie is a guy movie i guess he didn't really care about the acting and the plot of the movie.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I don't want this to come off as bashing or trashing, I'm simply going to state an opinion. This is a horrible album, and an overproduced try at a soundtrack. <br />First mistake:<br />There is no definite feel to the album. It starts depressing and ends depressing, but in between it's filled with conflict. I know this sound very appealing, but it seems crass to me. <br />The vocals are bad, and half the songs are downright painful to listen to.<br />The one good song, &quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot; can be purchased in the dar surperior UK/Norway import single, which includes a nice variety of wonderful mixes.<br />There is a time and a place for singing prostitutes, prancing lovers, and overzealous pimps, I believe. I'm just not sure I want to be there at the time.
0966638328|5.0|What a brilliant color guide and visually exciting reference guide.  I couldn't put it down after I started leafing through it.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie was placed on two different discs. That is unacceptable. The movie can go on one while the supplemental can go on other. Do not purchase this movie until it comes out on just one disc. A DVD can hold the entire movie if they didn't try to cram in so many different features on disc. They should have put DD and DTS on different versions, that may have reduced the amount of data to one disc.<br />Other than that great movie, good audio and video transfer, good features. Highly recommend once it's out on one disc.

0060934913|2.0|Anthony Bourdain is an ego-maniac who hails from a kitchen milieu that prides itself on &quot;covers&quot; - the number of orders that get sent out on any given night.  That he's graduated to both covers and quality is to his favor, but he seems to be most concerned with shocking us with the mess and mayhem of production line cooks and cooking, and in being the bad boy of the culinary world.  He rails against celebrity chefs, but has become what he dislikes. &quot;Kitchen Confidential,&quot; is a quick read, somewhat entertaining, moderately informative, occasionally affecting, and completely self-aggrandizing.  If you really want to read about how ugly a kitchen can be, take a look at &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London.&quot;
0792107683|4.0|Shane-1953<BR>117mins/Colour<BR>Alan Ladd<BR>Jean Arthur<BR>Van Heflin<BR>George Stevens<BR>Brandon De Wilde<BR>Jack Palance<BR>Ben Johnson<BR>Edgar Buchanan<br />Director George Stevens' legendary rendition of the archetypal Western myth earned 6 Academy Award nominations, and made Shane one of the timeless classics of American cinema. Based on Jack Schaefer's novel, the story brings Alan Ladd, a drifter and retired gunfighter, to the assistance of a homestead family terrorized by an aging cattleman and his hired gun. In fighting the last, decisive battle, Shane sees the end of his own way of life. Mysterious, moody and atmospheric, the film is enhanced by the intense performances of its splendid cast.Later a brief t.v series and also Arthur's last film.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Quite frankly, this is one of the best movies about the absurdity of war ever made.  Forget about the TV show which bvecame Alan Alda's soapbox.  This is the reel deal.  From gruesome operating room scenes to a wacky football game this movie is pure greatness.
6304698623|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies.  A definte classic and this one is just as good as the Shirley Temple version (although you should DEFINETLY check that one out as well)I recommend it for anyone, no matter what age.  A truly heart warming story, check it out!!!
B00003CXN3|5.0|It's great movie, I guess it's of the best movies which I've ever seen about drugs. We can see again wonderful directing by Steven Soderbergh. I was really shocked from this super film.
0688170528|5.0|amazing storyline. written in past and present and then brought together. amazing. i highly recomend this to anyone. suspensful. just great! read it. You wont regret it. :0)
B00003CXRP|4.0|I liked the show but the most important reason is there was a blooper in the end of the show as Helen Hunt runs down her drive way in the rain she is yelling Jack Jack but Tom Hanks name was Chuck and when she got in the truck she referred to him as Chuck. (BLOOPER)<BR>It was good but he spent to much time on the ocean and that got to be boring.
B000002LND|4.0|Madonna has been entertaining us for almost two decades and continues to grow and change as a musician. This album highlights her earlier hits from the 80's era as well as her early 90's work. Most of her hits are featured on this compilation though some songs I liked were omitted such as Dress You Up, Who's That Girl, True Blue, Take A Bow, etc.... Some of my favorite songs are Crazy For You (my fave on the entire album), Borderline, La Isla Bonita, Material Girl, and Get Into the Groove. Listening to these songs will get you moving. If you want to listen to her ballads check out Something to Remember which is a good cool-down album in contrast to the dance tracks of the Immaculate Collection. Madonna is not another flash in the pan. She is a true entertainer who will be around for a long time. Look, she has already lasted this long already in the music business. Way to go Madonna.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This is a remastered , uncensored cd of Johnny Cash`s famous 1968 Folsom Prison concert , featuring 3 previously unreleased tracks from the show .<br />The show itself is a classic ! Johnny ( an ex-con himself ) and his top notch band , featuring Carl Perkins on guitar , have the 2000 prisoners in the hall eating out of the palm of their hands as they storm through a set comprising of prison songs , Cash originals , and covers such as Lefty Frizzell`s - &quot; Long Black Veil &quot; to the obvious delight of the audience , the chilling lyrics to a lot of the songs offset by Cash`s dark sense of humour . You can just imagine how the prisoners must have felt as they heard songs about train journeys to far away places , and if that wasn`t bad enough , the rise in temperature is tangible as June Carter joins her future husband for a rendition of &quot; Jackson &quot; , the only thing stopping the inmates from thinking that they had died and gone to heaven is the constant announcements on the prison tannoy system ( talk about being brought back down to earth with a bump ) . This fabulous show ends fittingly with a song written by Glen Sherley an inmate doing time at Folsom prison ( I just hope he had enough years of freedom to spend the lucrative royalties ) .<br />American roots music doesn`t get any better than this !
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers, among those who know about it, is generally considered one of the funniest television shows of all time.  Created by and starring John Cleese (of Monty Python fame), each of the twelve episodes is sheer genius in some way or another.  <br />The setup is simple: Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, the rather snide owner of a second-rate hotel.  Cleese surrounds himself with hilarious characters, including his overbearing (but far more competent) wife and the bumbling but good natured waiter Manuel (&quot;You'll have to excuse him; he's from Barcelona.&quot;)  Each episode finds Fawlty involved in some scheme, which usually has something to do with abusing customers and hiding things from his wife.  The plots build in classic screwball fashion, as the situations get more and more absurd while Cleese digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole. The comedy ranges from incredible dialogue to some perfectly timed slapstick, and all of it's funny.<br />Though I'd seen all of the episodes before many times, the DVD set was a great buy.  It's packed with extras, including commentaries by the director of each episode and some really informative, in-depth interviews with John Cleese and other cast members.  In fact, while I got the discs just because I wanted copies of the episodes, I've had a ton of fun with the extras.  Add in fairly nice packaging (the art on each disc is hilarious) and some other cool things such as cleverly designed menus, and this is one of the better TV collections I've seen.  <br />Well worth your money if you've never seen the show but enjoy British comedy, or if you're an old fan and looking for a new way to appreciate this great series.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is some of the most evocative, cinegraphic music I ever heard - about as transporting as Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot;.  Since this music is several years old, I look forward to see what Sigur Ros has done in the meantime.
B00005NWM3|2.0|While this album has it's moments, I think it's a far cry from an &quot;awesome CD&quot; as some of the other reviewers here have eluded to. It lacks the depth of other much more notable albums that were released last year (i.e. sevendust and creed's new albums).  While no band can revamp their sound entirely from song to song, I find myself having to ask, &quot;which song is this again?&quot; If it's not the over-played radio hit &quot;how you remind me&quot; I find myself browsing the CD case to figure out what I'm listening to. I can't fathom why anyone would &quot;love&quot; this CD, which sounds more like an extension of their first album than new sound/new material. Pedestrian and lack-luster.  At least there is only 40 minutes of monotony.
6300216039|5.0|For me this one is up there with &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoos nest&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. You can't blame subsequent adaptions for adding guns and rap music because as far as I'm concerned this version tells the traditional tale of Romeo and Juliet as well as a film can. (the only change I'd make would be editing out a few sobs here and there.) It surprises me that this is the only version out there with &quot;child&quot; actors because Romeo and Juliets age is an essencial part of what makes the plot and dialogue psychologicaly belevable to me.<BR> This is more of a directors film than an actors film.  It's acted wonderfully but probably more because the actors were well chosen for the parts and less because they were skilled at the craft of acting.  Director, Franco Zeffirelli manages to enact the most paradied moment in western drama, the balcony scene, in a way that is at once so fresh and so fearlessly pure and straightforeward that I felt like I was watching an age old natural phenominon (like a sunrise) for the first time.  The only people I've met who don't love this film are folks who don't connect with the play in the first place.  Also, whoever wrote the dialogue did a nice job.<br />P.S. If a dated 1960s look bothers you then get the remastered widescreen DVD.  It feels more timeless.
0440180295|4.0|Few novels contain the sense of humor and the sense of tragedy as this Vonnegut classic.  This novel is about aliens, but is not science-fiction.  This novel is about war, but makes you laugh.  Almost impossible to describe, Slaughter-house Five captures the absudity and hopelessness of life in the most humorous way imaginable.  The subject matter seems similar to Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;, but the philosophical approach to time as the protagonist becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; makes this novel novel more compelling.
0553212737|5.0|Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.<br />The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos Santana is one of the great musicans of the current era. This album includes many guest artists and yet the constant through all the tracks is Carlos's playing. I love the first three Santana albums, but have not purchased anything since this album (apart from one disappointment). Carlos started playing the blues and this is evident in his music. This sound of this album is classic and is complemented by so many other good musicians. A bonus is 'The Calling' highlighting Eric Clapton. There is hardly a dud track.
0440224764|5.0|I'm a big fan of Grisham, and this book is definately in my list of his best work. If you read 'The Testament' and liked it, this book is a must. I couldn't stop reading it. It is the type of story that you just can't imagine how the character will get out of a bad situation and then the author surprises you with the answers. If you like Grisham's style, you'll definately like this book.
B00004Z459|5.0|With Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory the band has reaped a lot of success in the music world, and have done so very deservingly.  Every track has so much talent and feeling packed into it, and it makes the CD worth listening to over and over again.  The thing that is most amazing is the fact that the band doesn't have to swear consistently to get their names written in the music records unlike other bands such as Limp Bizkit; however Linkin Park has the same sort of feel that other rap-core/nu-metal bands have.  Songs such as In The End, and Crawling have become, and are instant hits in the music world that won't be forgotten overnight.  This CD is something that any rock fan would be happy to own and listen to over and over again, and sing the songs in their head all day long.
1558216847|5.0|this is a story like no other.  it is almost impossible to comprehend.  how do you stay alive in the desert as well as the snow-covered mountains of south asia?  how do you keep walking after you have been without water for several days?  you may or may not find the answer in this book but you will definitely be intrigued and entertained.
0684833395|5.0|Well, I never had to read this for school but I read it because<BR>my sister majored in english and she lent me the book because Ive always liked books that hold a mirror to society (1984,Brave New World..etc...) This one is no different, the catch-22 runs all of our lives.....in just about every way when you think about it...<BR>I saw the movie of this book and I think it was true to the book completly....My favorite character is Yossarian...though Major Major is funny too.....I like this book because I am anti-war, there are more constructive ways to resolve conflicts without bloodshed....sports are a good way for example...but that would be too intelligent :)   anyways....after you read this you will never want to join the military....period :)  I wish one of my friends who joined the armed forces read this, perhaps he would have not joined....for all I know he could be dead now...anyways you should read it because you should be curious..not because I told you to read it :)
0345448898|5.0|Some of the reviews I have seen have made comparisons to Harry Portter.  Do not be fooled.  These are VERY different books.  I bought them expecting the same warm and fuzzy feeling that the Harry books left me with but warm and fuzzy is not what Pullman writes about.  These books have a dark intensity that Harry does not and are clearly for an older more sophisticated audience.  Please don't buy these for an eight year old.  Buy them for your 28 year old.  Death, gore, fear and pain are all treated as part of life in a way that most children won't understand and a parent might not want to explain.  There is also love, loyalty, sacrifice and compassion in equal measure to the darkness.  The books explore the idea of soul, of religion, of god.  Very, very adult.  I read all three in a week and found them immensely gripping and moving.  I recommend them to anyone over 12.
B000002UY5|5.0|Just to set the record straight, Shannon Hoon died of a cocaine overdose (not heroin); and they did in fact release 2 more albums...\\"Soup\\" and \\"Nico\\" (the latter was released posthumously), all very good albums. <BR>Anyway, this album is a must have for any collection, it's just good rock n' roll. One of the most memorable CDs to come out of the '90's.  RIP Shannon.
B000002MIF|5.0|I was a little disappointed when I bought this, because it contained a lot of the Peel Session recordings I had recently bought. These are much better quality though, since the recordings I had were of the whole show with the interview parts over-running the songs. Peel tracks- &quot;What Difference Does It Make&quot;, &quot;Handsome Devil&quot;, &quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot;, &quot;This Night Has Opened My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Still Ill&quot;, &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, and &quot;Back to the Old House&quot;. There are also three tracks from the David Jensen show (which I've seen passed off as Peel Sessions, but arent!). &quot;These Things Take Time&quot;, &quot;You've Got Everything Now&quot;, and &quot;Accept Yourself&quot;.<br />Some performers do these in studio songs as throwaway tracks, but if you've heard the Peel interviews, you know that John Peel was one of the first people to play the Smiths on his show, and hence they're not only different, but sometimes even better versions than what you get on the regular editions. If you're a completionist, you must own this CD. If you're a casual fan, and may have some of these tracks already on various other CDs (the regular album release), don't worry about owning a second version of these songs. They're unique enough to stand on their own in most cases. Skip &quot;best of&quot; collections altogether. There are only four or five albums that consist of the bulk of the Smiths cannon, you're much better off with them all, than with the poor compilations that have been released to date. I own thousands of CDs, and nothing really stands out like the Smiths did during the 80s. Nobody sounds like them before or since.
B000002UB6|4.0|Speaking as a Beatles fan, I like the album Let It Be, but it seems to lack the quality of the preceding albums.<br />It's very easy to tell that the Beatles were struggling with their disagreements. One of the most tell-tale signs is John's asinine introduction to \\"Two Of Us\\", where he basically calls Linda a horse.<br />But the album has some good music on it nonetheless. Although John considered the White Album to be a Beatles album with solo works on it, Let it Be and Abbey Road are also. George proved through his songs on Let it Be and Abbey Road that he had as much musical muscle as John and Paul, John was almost totally preoccupied by \\"Yukko\\", and had little remaining interest in the band, Paul was struggling to keep the Beatles together and Ringo was in the middle of the entire battle. <br />All in all, Let it Be may not have the quality of Sgt. Pepper, but it's a Beatles album, and if it's Beatles, it's quality.
B000002AP1|5.0|But not your speakers, as some reviewer made that ridiculous<BR>claim recently here.  This new remix (by Iggy himself, presumably, or supervised by him) is certainly loud and in the <BR>red most of the way through, but I don't think it's damaged<BR>either my speakers or minisystem stereo yet.   Maybe I'm just<BR>careful and don't play it quite that loud, but I do like to<BR>play it reasonably loud.  The only side effect might have been<BR>to drive my neighbors insane, but otherwise it's good poison medicine Raw Power is....<BR>    I can't add much except to say this record is an unbelievable<BR>classic blast of rock and roll with few slow moments: even<BR>the slower numbers, &quot;Penetration&quot; and &quot;Death Trip&quot; cook along<BR>with blistering guitar &quot;solos&quot; (not really that long but solos nonetheless, and perhaps the better for it) that add some zing.<BR>My favorite songs are all of them, but especially the title tune,<BR>and &quot;Your Pretty Face (Is Going to Hell)&quot;, just absolutely destroy me and make me wanna be up dancing to the tunes wrecked out of my mind. <BR>   Most 21st Century rock albums should consign themselves to the bargain bin in shame, most will never come up to this level of excellence and energy and sheer aggression.  The thing is, Raw Power is sheer agression but it's tempered by great songs,<BR>great Iggy and lyrics, and the band, despite the muddy sound mix, still manage to demonstrate how great they were before<BR>things sorta fell apart for The Stooges.  This even puts the<br />1st Stooges album to shame, and I love that one too!<BR>  Buy this now.....
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is among my favorite Beatle Albums. Every Friday, after I've come home from school (11th grader), had a snack and everything, I have made it a tradition to listen to Rubber Soul.<br />The song lyrics may be somewhat adolescent, and it is true that the Beatles still had a little bit to go before &quot;growing up&quot; with their lyrics and songs, but I still like the songs.<br />Every track, in my opinion, shows the different personalities of the Beatles- and their talent also. Probably the best, sweetest song on the album is In My Life, which showed that John DID have an introspective, serious side.<br />Maybe you think I'm sexist, but I happen to like Run For Your Life. No, I don't agree with the lyric, but I like the actual musical composition of it. It's a fast-paced, rollicking song that is very enjoyable to listen to.<br />Rubebr Soul is a great album all around, and if you like the Beatles, you should buy it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I just had to drop an interjection here. Sure in a cinema stuffed with wannabe 'thrillers' it's easy for a few to get lost in the dust. But don't count JEEPERS CREEPERS out. Sure, fans of the 'slash-and-kill-yuppies-college-kids' type of movies will definately be disappointed. This type of thriller would better cater to fans of more 'psychological thrillers' where subtle visuals and eerie camera techniques drive the fear instead of 'slash-happy' action -- like Dean Koontz's &quot;PHANTOMS&quot;, and many video games like the Resident Evils and Silent Hill. <br />I think it was great the way the 'villian' was NOT some deranged boyfriend or a lonely shop owner -- the 'Scooby Doo' villian syndrome is WAY overplayed to the point that everyone who sits down to watch a thriller immediately starts taking notes on the bit-part characters near the beginning to decipher who the bad guy ahead of time. Victor Salva put a LOT of work into giving you a frightening villian who actually is MORE than just a man who walks dramtically slow!
B00005R87Q|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw in the Summer of 2001.<BR>In an otherwise mundane Summer,&quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;  heated it up a bit.<BR>Staring Vin Diesel,the fierce Michelle Rodugeriz,and Paul Walker,<BR>(Ja Rule has a couple of bit parts in it too)<BR>this movie is exciting and just damn good.<BR>No cheesy car scenes here,folks or bad scripts(even out of date<BR>movie critics liked this movie).<br />I  don't want to tell anybody the plot though 'cause that'll ruin it for you but you gotta see this movie!<br />(I can't wait for &quot;The Fast &amp; The Furious 2&quot; to be in theaters).
6301955676|3.0|Rather dissapointing sequel, but not totally a bad film. 'Bride of Re-Animator' (Re-Animator 2, in UK) has the standard gore and blood-soaked humour of the previous film.<BR>I thought David Gale (Dr.Hill) died in real life after 'Re-Animator' came out? Did I read wrong? Anyway if you liked the original, you may as well view this. I'd also like to see if the much rumoured 'Beyond Re-Animator' emerges in 2002.
0684800713|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a poignant, touching story of a group of post-World War I expatriates living lives of excess in Paris.  The hero, Jake Barnes, is condemned to a life of celibacy because of a war injury.  Brett Ashley, the woman he loves, goes from one sexual encounter to another.  Mike, her fianc, is a hard-drinking Scotsman who is financially and emotionally bankrupt.  They all seem to drink to forget, but they cant escape their many problems and are doomed to fail.  The bright, sunny setting of the fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, the cafes of Paris, and trout fishing in a mountain stream contrasts the characters' feelings of depression, hopelessness, and loneliness.  The action pivots around the bullfight, symbolic of Jake's situation.  No matter how strong and powerful the bull is, everyone knows he will not survive the onslaught of the matador.  This book is a slow paced novel with an emphasis on character development, tone, and theme.  Hemingway's words are spare and lean, using powerful verbs without loading descriptions down with too many adjectives.  This powerful, well-written novel gives the reader insight to what is often referred to as the &quot;lost generation,&quot; those who survived the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; but came back broken physically, emotionally, spiritually.  If someone can get past the slow beginning to this book, they will be rewarded with a simply told tragedy that is deeply symbolic and deeply moving.
B00003CXTG|1.0|It's virtually impossible for me to find any reasons to recommend this movie.Okay maybe the special effects during the main battle scene are pretty good.It's about the only aspect of this film that is in any way good.The other 2:30 minutes were a clichd bore.I mean how good actors took on this film having read a dreadful script is beyond me.The dialogue is stunted and pretty awful.The characters are all paper thin and the love triangle story is even thinner then that!The only actor to come out with his reputation held in tact is Cuba Gooding Junior-and even he's stereo-typed beyond belief.At least he adds a touch of humour in comparison to the wetness of the other main characters.As for the historical contexts and inventions and stuff-well I don't have a real problem with this-I mean when has Hollywood ever paid due regard to historical facts?The fact that the producers felt they needed an American victory of sorts for the viewer to celebrate is just so predictable-I mean why did they call this movie Pearl Harbor when most of the action takes place with the pilots as children or the years subsequent to this terrible attack when they gained some measure of revenge.I had to say that this was the most disappointing film of the year!
B00004Z3AV|5.0|If you are considering buying the box set over this one... Don't, look at the tracklisting... you can't compare it!  Spellbounding from begining to end!
B00000I3JO|5.0|This quite simply is one of the greatest c.d.'s I've ever heard.I bought it when it was first released(over 12 years ago) and have never grown tired of it.The Blue Nile always had a sound and a pride in their production that their music never seems to sound out of date.If you listen to other groups of that era who used synths that had an orchestral effect-they seem to sound so hollow and 'tinny' now.It's no wonder that The Blue Nile were the only group that I know of who were signed by Linn-makers of amazing stereo equipment-an off shoot of Virgin(and no I don't work for the company).This is one the most melancholy c.d.'s you'll ever hear.It's haunting and Buchanan's vocals have such a fragile lonliness about them-Yet even though it's all pretty sad-it isn't despairing nor does it wallow in selfpity.It may be downcast but a rich beauty always seems to shine through.Musically it seems to depict a very urban soundscape which backs up lyrical references to streaming traffic,downtown lights and the city as a ghost town in the very early hours of the morning.The imagery behind the words and music seem to paint pictures of a dark,damp city in the heart of winter.This may sound very dreary,but believe me on those dark nights of winter this c.d. can chill you out like no other.Electric guitars strum gently,grand sweeping synth movements and string and horn effects.There isn't a loud or fast song on this c.d. at all-it would sound so completely out of context.There are only 7 tracks but most tracks are well over five minutes long-and each one is stunning.This is the best Blue Nile c.d. in my opinion.We had to wait for what seemed like an eternity for their next c.d.-and even that one was released a long time ago.They may work very slowly-but when they do release a c.d. well it's well worth the wait.Essential!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I have to say that anyone who doesn't like Linkin Park has some major problems! They most certainly are not into this kind of music--probably country and western! I cannot think of any song on this CD that isn't a work of art!! They are truly geniuses and they really make a great band together. My brother gave me this CD and I was mesmerized by it. I listen to it over and over again. My 4 year old even loves it and I have even caught her singing to the songs! <BR>Those who don't like this CD are just way out of their league. This is truly great music. But, don't take my word for it or any others for that matter. If you haven't gotten it yet, go and get it now!! You won't be sorry!
B000007SPT|5.0|Of all the record companies who have influenced modern music,I reckon none have done so as much as 4AD records.From Indie rock to trance,from alternate sounds to ambient-this company had groups that were always one step ahead of the rest and were always willing to look beyond the mainstream.When This Mortal Coil were created-an amalgamation of all these groups it was certainly an exciting prospect.Groups like Cocteau Twins,Dead Can Dance,The Wolfgang Press,etc working together to write songs and also do amazing covers of songs by Tim Buckley,Alex Chilton,etc-it was a daunting prospect and one that worked so amazingly well.It also provided a great introduction to try out the music of those 4AD groups properly.<br /> As you can imagine with so many people working on an album-the sounds of the tracks are quite diverse.The difference between Howard Devoto of Buzzcocks fame singing Holocaust with it's piano's and cello to the Indie guitar romp track 11 &quot;Not Me&quot;.Liz Fraser does the most amazing cover version of Buckley's &quot;Song To The Siren&quot;-comparisons to the original are quite startling.She almost has this soothing spiritual lilt that sounds sort of Asian,and this accompanies the most amazingly gentle shimmering guitar from Robin Guthrie-I didn't know it was a guitar until I read the innersleeve and this was made in the early 80's long before studio trickery could be used so effectively.Compare this to Lisa Gerard's frightening hypnotic vocals on the track &quot;Dreams Made Flesh&quot;-they're described as &quot;yang t'chin&quot; vocals and they are just unbelievable.Her Dead Can Dance partner Brendan Perry plays what called a bass drone-which sounds like some sort of  Ancient Greek instrument.There are long Pink Floyd type instrumentals and shorter minimalist tracks of romantic sentiment.Yet despite all these contrasts each track has a close bond.It's almost like going on some sort of spiritual journey in a storm-full of different emotions-soothing,harsh,ambient and raging.There is a great sense of blissed out satisfaction when you reach the end of the c.d.<br /> For those people who are into listening to the &quot;chilled out&quot; experiences that seem to make up 90% of all compilations-then maybe you should check out where this concept had it's origins.This Mortal Coil are a group of sorts that very few people seem to be aware of-yet if you name some of it's members people seem more aware.I've given this c.d. to so many people and to a person they have all come back with the reaction of &quot;where has this been all my musical life&quot;.One of the greatest albums ever released in my opinion!
0380799006|5.0|I got this book before the birth of our second child.  While I think it's probably more geared towards older children, I wanted to &quot;prepare&quot;, and I'm glad I did.  There were a few things I was able to use right away.  It gives you some key points to keep in the back of your mind, and a lot of practical advice.  This was a fantastic book.  I know I will refer to it again and again and again as my two grow up together.
B00003CXRM|1.0|OH what a shame!  This cannot be from the same brothers who did Fargo, the Big Lebowski and Arizona! THIS IS SIMPLY BAD CINEMA<br />The actors recite their lines as automats while poorly faking a southern accent from God knows where, the alleged storyline as a parallel with the Odyssey is simply ludicrous, and the miserable old Hollywood cliches about the South and Southerners are all there (idiots, dirty, KKK lovers, blindly religious, etc. - the KKK &quot;ballet&quot; [I am not kidding, they actually ... dance!] is particularly idiotic).<br />Two things get this movie one miserable star: the sometimes stunning scenery and the music.<br /><br />Bottom line: get a good or better scenery somewhere else, and buy the soundtrack, you'll save money and you'll learn about good traditional southern music.
0345451325|1.0|Eric Nylund knows zilch about writing combat. This some of the worst amateur drivel I've ever had the misfortune to come across.<br />It must have been a struggle to write something so flat and uncharasmatic as this. The action reads like it was written for members of the Oprah Book Club or as an after school special. <BR>It's not good scifi. It's not good action. It's not emotionally mature or challenging in any way.<br />What is most surprising is Nylund's other books &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; etc. are pretty good. This on the other hand is a car accident with no survivors. There are dozens of fantastic authors writing military scifi. Nylund is not one of them.<br />Want good miltiary scifi? Try John G Hemry's Stark series, Ian Douglas's &quot;Semper Luna&quot; trilogy, Steve Perry's &quot;Matador&quot; series, Walter Jon Williams &quot;Metropolitan&quot; series, David Weber &quot;Honor Harrington&quot; series, Joe Haldeman's &quot;Forever Peace&quot; and &quot;Forever War&quot;.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I thought twice before write this review. For once, much has been said already and I thought I wouldn't add much to it. Besides that, I think the album speaks for itself, so, why write a review? Although, since the album's release, I've read so much crap about it that I've decided to take a chance and try to express my opinion. Most critics have a tendency to make comparisons when somebody like Adams (after all, this is only his second solo album after Whiskeytown) starts to follow his own way. I don't think this a good thing at all, neither for the artist nor to the public that wants to check it out the work. I mean, how is it possible not to write the so called &quot;americana style songs&quot; (if you want to label it) without the influence of The Band, Neil Young, Bob Dylan and, why not, Van Morrison? Thank God the man has those influences! It shows, at least, that he's got a hell of a good taste for music. But to make comparisons with those artists is a whole different thing. It's useless. To put an end to it, the album is just great. So, never mind the bullocks and go for it. Ryan Adams has set his sails. Let's the wind do the rest.
0679420266|3.0|A great book, the new translation may be more &quot;American&quot; somehow, but many of the most important parts seem much more clunky than in the original Stewart Gilbert translation.  Some magic was lost, especially in the ending, the part where Merseault observes the people from his balcony, etc.  Just get the other translation, it's easy to find used.  5 stars for the original translation, 3 for this one.
0671045857|4.0|I have read many mysteries and terror novels before, however, I feel that this book is more interesting than the others. It describes in depth all the horror and terror of being lost in the woods, and how alone a little girl would really feel in this situation. I like how the author conveys this girl&iexcl;¦s love for the player, even though she is lost in the woods, she has the feeling that he is still with her. Her strong feelings for Tom Gordon are realistic and the book shows how a nine-year-old girl really thinks. When she is lost in the woods, the author uses many ways to convey the fear of what might happen, and also allows the reader to experience what it feels like to be lost in the forest alone.<br /> When I was reading this book, I would sometimes think and ask myself<br />&iexcl;§If I were this girl, would I be as brave as her, or would I be terribly afraid?&iexcl;¨<br />It made me think about being alone and how I could cope. I enjoyed reading this book and enjoyed the fear of being in the woods.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this trilogy to be done via live action actors, as well as the technology to provide the special effects.  The music is exaclty what I would have done were I the composer. Enya is the perfect person to have done Arwen's and Aragorn's theme. The combination of the different instruments creates the perfect feeling for this movie. This music was written with the right amount of emotion. Composing this kind of music is a task in itself! I love listening to it because it creates the world of Middle Earth for me and it creates the sense of it being real.
B00005JH9W|5.0|Once a banned and controversial movie, now a cult classic, \\"Freaks\\" is misleadingly categorized as a \\"horror\\" film.  As a result, the average horror consumer is apt to be disappointed that watching the film today is anything but a scary experience.  On the other hand, the sensitive viewer is apt to discover that recognizing one's own commonality with \\"freaks\\" is far more rewarding than being repulsed or shocked by one's difference from them.<br /><br />Browning's film remains relevant because, unlike the carnival freak shows of the past or the Maury Povich-Jerry Springer television shows of the politically correct present, it makes no concessions to its subjects' abnormalities and deformities.  With the exception of the didactic, preachy written preface that the studio felt compelled to attach to later releases of the film, the camera represents freaks as ordinary human beings, not as unusual specimens.<br /><br />I see that the reviews appear to fall into two categories: 1. \\"Freaks\\" humanizes these marginalized and exploited human beings; 2. \\"Freaks\\" scares us to the degree that the revenge of the freaks takes on violence and mutilation beyond our expectations. How about a third possibiliity? The film is disturbing because it uses these little, practically invisible and therefore inconsequential, deformed creatures to expose the blindness, selfishness, and pride that deform \\"normal\\" human beings. (It's a paradox that would have been loved by Flannery O'Connor who, in \\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find,\\" uses a serial killer to expose the even greater evil of a foolish and \\"proper\\" old grandmother.)<br /><br />In fact, the narrative frame of the film lets the viewer in on the the film's \\"real\\" freak show--the once-beautiful trapeze artist who becomes deformed in proportion to her unwillingness to recognize the humanity she shares with freaks.  Browning's film asks us both to see freaks as human beings like ourselves and, even more importantly, to look to our own deformities.  The idea is not to take comfort in our difference from freaks but to ponder our similarity with them.  Any time we use someone else's bad fortune as a measure against which to compare our own good fortune, we blaspheme God's creation and deform our own souls.<br /><br />It's important to notice that the freaks are not shown as the victims of an exploitive society--the managers of the freak show and the paying customers--but of their supposed co-workers. Whereas the lines separating normal and abnormal, freak and non-freak, those ill-served and those favored by their Creator are explicit and accepted, it's the hypocritical behavior of the strong man and trapeze artist that offends and galvanizes the community of freaks. When the trapeze lady marries a freak, then recoils at the freaks' welcoming chorus-- \\"one us us\\"--she reveals an inhumanity going far beyond the mere voyeurism of the supporters of freak shows. Hers is the evil that Dante places below even violence and murder: the lowest circles of hell are reserved for the deceitful and fraudulent.<br /><br />As long as human beings practice hypocrisy, remaining ignorant of the ties that bind us to each other more than the comparatively insignificant differences that separate us from each other, we have every right to fear the revenge of the freaks. As \\"normal\\" but undeniably flawed and limited individuals, we would all do well to keep before ourselves the \\"code of the freaks,\\" endeavoring not to violate it in thought, word, or deed.<br /><br />Finally, it's easy to understand how Browning's film became a favorite with midnight movie audiences in the sixties and seventies.  Certainly the countercultural crowd drawn to such \\"alternative\\" films must have sensed more than a little kinship with the freaks on the screen.  And if that weren't enough, it is the communal bonding and determined spirit of the freaks themselves, not the intervention of \\"establishment\\" social-moral forces, that prevails and triumphs in theend.
B000002GB2|3.0|Styx starts off their new cd with a one two punch, Light up, and Lorreli. Both songs sung by Dennis show the growing range of his vocals, and the range of his keyboards. The cd is very keyboard driven, and very well produced. Both songs, along with this cd's Suite Madame Blue are Styx' classics.<BR> Lonely Child and Midnight Ride are you typical Dennis, and JY songs. Mother Dear would be JC's last song for Styx (he would leave the group before they would start this tour).

B00005QZ7U|2.0|This has to be the most obnoxious film I've ever seen. The sets and costumes are visually stunning, but I felt the pace of the film to be manic to the point of being nauseating. I really, really tried to like this film, but ended up turning it off half way through.
0688156819|5.0|This collection is a disturbing bunch of very short stories that showcase misfit children, whose oddities are grossly exaggerated by Burton's simplistic words and grotesque illustrations. The most disturbing theme of the book is all the children who in some way or another, get in the way of their parents' relationship because of their strangeness. The title poem: &quot;The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy,&quot; exemplifies this. In this twisted poem with it's frightening black and white pictures, a father barbarically devours his oyster-like child to gain more sexual prowess. I would recommend this book only to people who enjoy Burton's darker movies and his theme of being a misfit, to other people, the poems might seem strangely cruel, and the world outlook would seem dark and pessimistic.
0618154043|5.0|Let's clear the air: I am a huge Tolkien fan and I have loved this book for years. But this edition (Houghton Mifflin hardcover) is just a jewel. Nansmith's cover art of T&uacute;rin and Mîm the Dwarf is stunning.<br />The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are famous, and justly so, for they are the only novels that Tolkien ever completed. He was a real perfectionist. So if you really want to witness the full genius of Tolkien you have to tap into a vast series of works, each individually &quot;unfinished&quot; but altogether forming a very satisfying completeness. The Silmarillion is a key and a summary of the vasy mythology--it really is required reading--but once that is behind you Unfinished Tales is your first stop to experience the greatness that is Middle-earth. And, despite its name, the writings collected in this volume are for the most part fairly complete.<br />The highlight of Unfinished Tales is the Tale of the Children of H&uacute;rin (Narn i Hîn H&uacute;rin), itself a short novel over 100 pages in length--thirteen chapters plus Appendix. This is an incredible epic story set in the First Age, written in full narrative form. The great human hero H&uacute;rin of the North is captured alive after slaying seventy trolls in the great War of the Jewels, and brought before the throne of Morgoth, god of evil (Sauron's ancient master). When H&uacute;rin refuses to serve him, he casts a great curse on all his kin. We then follow the fate of H&uacute;rin's son T&uacute;rin--his fostering by the Elvenking Thingol; his adventures as an outlaw; his friendship with Beleg the Bowman and Mîm the Dwarf; of the nation they founded and their war with the Orcs; of T&uacute;rin's capture ... and most importantly of his feud and battles with Glaurung, Father of Dragons. This is one of my favorite stories of all time, and I highly recommend it. The sequel is The Wanderings of H&uacute;rin, published in The War of the Jewels--which follows the father H&uacute;rin's actions after he is finally released from prison. Also an intriguing read.<br />Unfinished Tales also includes a ton of short works dealing with the First Age, the Second Age, and the Third Age--there are fourteen pieces together. Many of these are tales directly relating to The Lord of the Rings--the tale of Isildur, for example; The Hobbit told from Gandalf's point of view; and The Fellowship of the Ring told from the point of view of the Ringwraiths. But my favorite is a section called 'The Istari'.<br />'The Istari' (the order of Wizards) is extremely important. It includes several essays on the Five Wizards: their names, their nature, their origin, their powers, and their mission. This is the central, underlying subtext of The Lord of the Rings which is never really explained until you read this. Learn of the mission of Radagast the Brown. Learn of the ancient rivalry between Saruman the White and Gandalf the Grey. Learn the names and the fate of the two remaining wizards, the Blue Wizards.<br />It must be pretty clear that I wholeheartedly recommend this book, but that I only recommend it after The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. But if you qualify, you are in for a treat, my friend.read. <br />Unfinished Tales also includes a ton of short works dealing with the First Age, the Second Age, and the Third Age--there are fourteen pieces together.

B00004XMSN|5.0|Who could ask for a more pleasing angel then the beloved Cary Grant? Playing an angel named Dudley, Grant lights up the screen as a guardian angel for the Bishop and his wife, played by David Niven and Loretta Young. The Bishop who seems to have lost touch with the true meaning of his religion and his role in the church becomes somewhat antagonized by the appearance of angel Dudley in his life. The series of events that occur provide some good old-fashioned comedy with a great lesson as well. This is a movie that you will want to watch again and again and gives other Christmas favorites a run for their money.

0060001941|5.0|A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a touching, coming of age story, about little Francie Nolan, growing up in poverty-stricken Brooklyn. I believe that what makes a novel a classic, is when it can be enjoyed and understood whether it is read one day after it is written or 50 years after it's release. Such is the case for Betty Smith's master piece. There isn't a lot of action and comotion in this novel, but there is a lot of life. It has it's moments of sadness, happiness and humor. There are issues that a young girl shouldn't have to deal with such as alcoholism, death...poverty but as in life the novel has it's ups and downs.  It is impossible not to fall in love with delightful little Francie Nolan. A true relection of the highs and lows and the cracks and glitter of life.
0805062971|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk's maiden voyage into books is one that will grab you by the nostrils and drags you, with each of the 206 pages slapping you in the face.  This nihilstic masterpiece follows a top of the line yuppie as he meets a man, the man, Tyler Durden.  Tyler is the man our narrator dreams to be.  Buff, smart, dangerous, Tyler holds them all in the palm of his hand.  Tyler and our narrator begin a club of men who relieve their stress by fighting.  Thus Fight Club is born.  Things begin to escalate as fighting becomes not quite enough.  Soon vandalism and all around anarchy become the focus of the fight club.  The climax will stun you and if you've only seen the movie THE LAST CHAPTERS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!   Better?  Worse?  Guess you'll just have to read to find out.
B000003TA4|1.0|The people who give this album good reviews show that they know nothing about the nature of music.  Even someone that has a rudimentary knowledge of scales will see just how poor and simple this album is.  If you like Nirvana, you have no right to critisize todays mainstream pop.  It's no different.  Please, someone tell me how this is so great and innovative?  Power chord changes, incredibly simplistic and repetative bass lines, etc.  What am I missing?  You wanna see some real guitar playing?  Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Slash, Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde, Leo Kottke, and Tuck Andress to name a few.
6300215717|5.0|Roman Holiday may not be the perfect movie, but with a new little nymph named Audrey Hepburn introduced it sure leans that way.  Hepburn plays a princess (what else?) who is on the run from her heritage as she explores her freedom.  She is befriended by a reporter (played by an eerily old to be hitting on her Gregory Peck) and he takes her for a darling day on the town.  Another plus for this film is that it was actually shot on the streets of Rome.  This only adds to it's beauty.  Hepburns charm as the naive princess is untouchable.  Her subtle accent plays in your ear like soft violins and her eyes will make you melt.  The film is a must see but it's Hepburn you can't stop admiring.
B00005JKMO|4.0|Armed with the knowledge that the critical consensus says &quot;Ali&quot; is a flawed film, I wasn't expecting much going in.  Coming out, I would agree that on some fundamentally important levels, it is a flawed film.  But it also does some things remarkably well.  Most notably, it allows those of us too young to have seen it for ourselves the chance to experience the roller coaster ride that was Muhammad Ali in his prime.  <br />&quot;Ali&quot; begins, quizzically, with an announcer introducing Sam Cooke as he takes the stage to sing.  But once the music gets going, and the film intercuts scenes of a young Ali running the streets and reliving memories, we are well aware of the world we are about to enter.  It's a stunning opening, mixing athletics, entertainment, and politics as effectively as Ali himself did.  It positions Ali as the seminal sporting figure of the 1960's, just as the first 60 pages of Don DeLillo's book &quot;Underworld&quot; did for Bobby Thomson's &quot;Shot Heard Round the World&quot; in the 1950's.  I don't make that comparison lightly.<br />Seeing as how this is a biopic about a boxer, it is unavoidable that I talk about the effectiveness of the fight scenes.  I thought they were tremendous, full of kinetic energy, confusion, power, and glory.  Director Michael Mann's pet camera trick, i.e. shooting over the protagonist's shoulder, was used to great effect here (as it was in the rest of the movie).  It allowed the audience to feel what it would be like inside the ring with Sonny Liston, or how well the Rope-a-Dope was working on George Foreman, or the beat down that Ali received in the first of his Pyrrhic bouts with Smokin' Joe Frazier.  And Mann doesn't only use his camera to convey important information, he uses sound as well.  In the Zaire fight scenes, listen to Foreman's breathing.  It gets perceptibly, but subtly, heavier as the rounds go on.  Brilliant!<br />Will Smith, who's never had to sustain a role of this size for this long, does an excellent job.  Physically transformed, you believe that he could hold his own in the ring.  His acting is stunning, capturing not only Ali's louder moments (which shouldn't have been a stretch for him) but also his quieter, contemplative, anxious moments.  We get to see just how much of an act the public Ali persona was, in that it could crumble instantly the moment trouble reared its ugly head, only to re-emerge from the ashes again when needed.  While Smith will never make you forget the titanic charisma of the real thing, but he does come out of the film without a mark on his face (&quot;...so I must be the Greatest!&quot;).<br />The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, only some of the performances were obviously left on the cutting room floor.  Ali had such a vast array of colourful characters in his entourage, that the less flamboyant ones (read: Paul Rodriguez as Dr. Ferdie Pacheco) get nary a line.  Standouts include: Jamie Foxx as 'Bundini' Brown, a mystical motivator with manic depressive tendencies; Jeffrey Wright as an underwritten Howard Bingham, freelance photographer and spouter of periodic pearls of wisdom; and Ron Silver, as trainer Angelo Dundee.  Although I would have liked to have seen how this motley crew was assembled, just hanging out with them was enough fun.  Special notice should be given to Jon Voight, who's Howard Cosell equals Smith's Ali in that neither is an impersonation, but an impression of their respective real life figures.  Voight captures the twinkle in Cosell's eye whenever Ali is around.  The two form a fine mutual amusement society.  But Cosell off camera is a different beast, looking out for Ali as a father figure.  Smith and Voight have great chemistry in every scene they have together.<br />As for those flaws, I've identified two.  Paradoxically, the film is too long *and* not long enough.  <br />The film is too long, in that some scenes, while beautiful and relevant, felt over-extended.  The visceral moment whenAli realizes what he means to the people of Zaire is preceded by an endless and repetitive montage of him running through the streets.  Many of the film's best moments would have been better with a bit of trimming, which would have helped the overall flow.<br />The film is not long enough, in that the more naive of its audience members will be in the dark without some crucial information.  The magnitude of the first Liston bout is impalpable.  The film tries to tell us that Liston is unstoppable, but it never shows us.  And the extended time in Africa, which is essential to show why it was so important for Ali to win, is glossed over in places.  For more information on the Liston fight, and peeks into Clay's childhood, read David Remnick's book &quot;King of the World&quot; (on page 195, you'll even find out why Clay went blind for a round).  For more insight into the Zaire fight, see Leon Gast's documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;.<br />Armed with this background information, &quot;Ali&quot; is a less confusing bit of nostalgia.  It allows you into Ali's life, behind the scenes with probably the most important athlete of the 20th century, while never glossing over his human flaws.  It's a fine film.
B000002P5W|5.0|One of the most amazing pieces of art in the 20th century is Jimi Hendrix's Axis: Bold as Love.  From the opening monologue you are taken through a psychidelic ride of rock and blues.  Hendrix lays down dynamic riffs in Spanish Castle Magic that would hold true even today.  Three songs later in his ballad Little Wing Hendrix could bring a tear to your eye with a simple love story.  And concluding is the title track which is a trip in itself.  Hendrix works through the color of the rainbow gives a powerful yet memorable chorus and concludes it with a spectrum of sound that will leave you wanting to run the album one more time.  Granted there is no Fire or Purple has on this album but don't miss out, it is every bit as good as its Hendrix brethren.
B00000DQSS|5.0|I've written a review for this one a few weeks ago and then gave it 4 stars, because I regard The Dreaming as her masterpiece and automatically gave that one 5 stars, and Never For Ever got 4, because it was the runner-up. It's a wrong thought I now realise; as Never For Ever is a total masterpiece too, though in another way as The Dreaming.<br />The Kick Inside was the first Kate Bush record I bought, only for Wuthering Heights actually. I thought it was OK, but after a few listens; it ended up somewhere in a dusty closet and I never listened to it again. Luckily for me, the turning point came when I bumped into a second-hand (third-hand even, maybe) copy of Never For Ever on vinyl at a little flea-market in Amsterdam. It was so cheap that I bought it. When I heard it, I liked it OK, though it took some time to fully appreciate it. I didn't invest that much time into it, just thought it was nice for it's seventies artwork and sound, but I know better now.<br />Never For Ever is, from beginning to end, a breath-taking, out of this world, fairytale-ish and haunting experience. Here, one can sense a certain kind of mood that is not to be found on other albums, I just can't describe it. On The Dreaming and this one, Kate was at her absolute peak, it's amazing what she does here.<br />Babooshka combines gorgeous melody and a funny little tale about a wife being suspicious about her husband and sends him letters<BR>under another name and finally meets him in disguise. It flows into the awkward, beautiful Delius (Song Of Summer). It has a haunting melody that sometimes pops into my head at night and then I just feel kind of uncomfortable or something. Don't know what it is with that song, it's so eerie, strange and beautiful that I can't put it into words. <BR>  Blow Away (For Bill)... One of my favorites on the album. In the part where Kate goes 'Please don't thump me, don't bump me, don't dump me back there, I want to stay here' I just feel shivers down my spine. You can hear that it's sung with emotion, it's like she's really in despair in that part. <BR>  All We Ever Look for sounds like a fairytale being told in music, amazing song, with amazing effect if you hear it through headphones (a door slamming, a woman walking on high heels, birds twittering, Hare Krishna's chanting...). <BR>  On to two of the more challenging songs: The Wedding List and Violin. The first one is another favorite; it tells the tale of a bride killing her future husband and has a fantastic ending with Kate using her vocal abilities quite good. Same goes for Violin; a song many people are scared off by, but is a nice one, though it does break the carefully built up atmosphere a little with it's kind of outdated, rocky guitars and not really deep theme (she just likes the violin quite much, that's it). <BR>  Though, when The Infant Kiss starts, there is that feeling again. That strange feeling. It's musical beauty taken to the extreme, as far as I'm concerned, and the lyrics are quite daring for that time; it tells about a grown woman falling in love with a little boy.<BR>  And then there's Night Scented Stock. No words, only Kate's voice recorded on about 10 tracks (I think), creating a one-woman, angelic choir that is the perfect bridge to the wonderful, and well known Army Dreamers and the heavy-themed Breathing.<br />I can't express my true feeling about this album, as that stuff really only sounds really logical to yourself, but I think it's clear that this is an album that is essential for every Kate fan and everyone claiming to be a serious lover of music. For me, Never For Ever leaves Hounds Of Love far, far behind. There's so much dreamyness, melody and beauty (in a different way than most people know it, like in shallow sounding ballads like And Dream Of Sheep) to be found here that it's sometimes overwhelming. An album I will cherish until the day that I die.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Johnny Depp plays George Jung, your every day man turned multi-millionaire drug dealer.  The amazing journey starts with just a bit of weed going to people on the beach, soon he and his friends are working their way to Mexico in major exports.  After a brief stop in jail Depp changes from marijuana to cocaine.  Soon Depp has so much money he can't fit anymore in his house.  It is in this time he meets his wife-to-be decently played by Penelope Cruz.  A mishap with his wife later and he is in jail again.  The part about this film that sets it apart from most drug movies is that it shows the highlights of the illegal exchange business but it also shows the bottoming out.  The other thing it has is a connection with the characters. You actually begin to feel for Depp as he is separated from the one thing that he loves in his life, his daughter.  Franka Potente (Run Lola Run) and Paul Rubin (Pee Wee Herman) also have roles in this film that has heart and substance(s).

6302491940|5.0|Don't be fooled by the artwork on the cover of the American release.  This isn't a shoot'em up gangster/mafia movie.  This is a smart, funny, imaginative movie about a heist.  In the U.K. this movie is lauded as one of the best movies of the century.  Maybe Michael Caine's absolute best movie!  I've watched this movie dozens of times and it never gets boring!  The most famous scene of the movie is the car chase with three mini-coopers!  Besides being a car that defined a generation, the mini shows its stuff in this great scene!  They drive on roofs, jump off roofs, drive thru water, down stairs, and it's a pleasure to watch!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|A question I'd like to pose to the admirers of this film and it's DVD counterpart: Amongst the *Goodies* found on the double disk release, was &quot;The Story&quot; (or ANY story or narrative, for that matter) found anywhere? Maybe tucked away in some of the storyboards? Maybe in some obscure Easter Egg? <br />I give the movie two stars primarily for the fine, sharp cinematography of Donald McAlpine and beautiful production design by Catherine Martin, but the director Baz Luhrmann, though a very capable producer (having birthed this 127 minute long MTV video), is cleary suffering from &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; syndrome. And so it seems are most who fawn over this paean to Attention Deficit Disorder.

6305910103|5.0|I would rate this movie as tied for the best of the original six films, with the other one being #VI.  There's lots more nerdy technical stuff--from the simulations to the fighting between ships, and enough booming to get my subwoofer to make some noise too.  Of course, Montalban is quite the badguy in the Khan role.
B00005QDW1|4.0|i have read a couple of these reviews and obviously they haven't heard the album.  to the last two kids who gave the album a zero, stating that the album was &quot;repetitive,&quot; and that it was &quot;essentially a chorus repeated from the beginning to the end of the song&quot;: &quot;STOP DOWNLOADING YOUR SONGS ON MORPHEUS AND AUDIOGALAXY AND BUY THE ALBUM!!!!&quot;  you would know that &quot;rocksteady&quot; is an actual album with verses and chords. the mp3s out there are the chorus repeated over and over for 3-4 min.   <br />now for the album. don't expect &quot;rock steady&quot; to be comparable to &quot;tragic kingdon&quot; or even &quot;return to saturn.&quot; although they have grown and matured as a band by blending electronica, pop, hip-hop, reggae/dancehall, and r&amp;b with rock, its nothing groud breaking or &quot;brilliant&quot; nor is it supposed to be.  the use of catchy loops and gwen's familiar voice makes &quot;rock steady&quot; a pleasant and fun album, which is what the band is all about.
0844663662|2.0|Slaughterhouse Five is an intersting book which gives science fiction a neat twist.  The plot is very hard to follow because of the main characters time traveling.  This stream of consiousness book makes you think about life now and after death.  But if you are looking for a no brainer easy read this is not the book for you.
0345448898|4.0|The Golden Compass is a book that you would really like, if you love adventure.  The main character is Lyra who tries to save her friend Roger from the gobblers.

0141301155|4.0|If you haven't read this book yet...JUST READ IT!!! Roald Dahl's just brilliant! His got such a wild imagination! He makes up these crazy stories that just keeps you reading on and on and you just might wonder if all this had actually happened to him or how can he think of such amazing things! This is the first time I've ever read a book with a non-stop supply of short and unpredictable little storeis connected that keeps you curious and interested. In other books you know there's always a climax at some point, where there's the most exciting and &quot;twisty&quot; part of the whole book, but you'd probably  can't find the climax in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It seems like the climax is throughout the whole book! Fine...I'm exagerating a little, but you'll pretty much agree with me after read it anyway. (Writing this review makes me want to put exclamation marks after every sentence :) hHEhe) Well anyway, let me tell you some of my favorite parts. The parts where no one else can think of other then Roald Dahl. I love the part with the thousands-and-thousands-of-botton-covered-glass-elevator-that-moves-in-all-directions. They're all labeled! Isn't that cute! You just press any one of them and it'll get you to that place in no time at all. I also liked reading about all the different types of candies that was made in in Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Believe it or not? Many of those candy's have actually come up in every kids' mind before, like forever-lasting-taste-chewing gums, candies that can take over breakfast, lunch and dinner, or even a castle that's made all out of chocolate! And there's MUCH MUCH MORE! Read some other reviews and you'll see that even though this book sounds quite childish but there are still readers and Roald Dalh lovers  ranging from all ages. It's a relaxing boook. People should take a break sometimes from reading hard books. You can read this for a bed time story, filling your brain up with fantasies and after you fall asleep, you'llfind yourself somewhere in a beautiful land in dream world...HhAHah...just adding some more to my review. Anyway, I won't waste anymore of your precious time. GO READ CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY RIGHT NOW!!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I've liked Dylan since the 60s, but I had pretty much stopped paying much attention to his music thru most of the 80s and 90s.  The last Dylan I bought was his acoustic LP from a few years ago, and I found it somewhat disappointing, played it maybe twice.  However, one night a couple of months ago I heard &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; from Love And Theft on the car radio, and was blown away because the song rocked harder than anything I've heard from Bob in a long long time.  (The first verse of Lonsesome Day is lifted from an old blues tune and then after that it's pure Bob, it sounds like he's making it up on the spot.)  Even if you are not a Dylan fan per se, more than half of this recording is just a great blues album, with a some lighter swing and folky sounding tunes thrown in for good measure.  His voice is so broken-down he's almost into Howlin' Wolf territory!  The band does a great job on both the rock and acoustic numbers, and this release really grooves like few Dylan albums have.  Apart from the style of the musical production, which is muscular and forceful, the songs themselves are the some of best I've heard from him for years.  The most catchy and favorite tune for me so far is &quot;Mississippi&quot; -- a fantastically well-made song.  It's hard to believe he gave a tune this good to Cheryl Crow, that's pretty much throwing pearls before swine in my opinion, but I suppose he figured he could use the royalties if she sold a bunch of records.  I keep playing this album over again, and I can't remember when the last time that happened after buying a new CD.  Anyone who thinks Bob is used up, well he ain't.  <br />Although I prefer the rocking, bluesier numbers at this point,  I expect some of the other tunes to grow on me.  I still have more listening to do with this set of songs -- as with much of Bob's work, the lyrics are dense with information and it takes several listenings at least to absorb them.  On the softer swingy tunes it's kind of a rough sonic contrast between the sweeter sounding music and Bob's ravaged voice, but the songs still hold up.  I could certainly hear other singers successfully interpreting some of these tunes.  <br />Oh yeah -- if you are a rock n roll or blues guitar player (I'm a long-time working musician myself) you will certainly appreciate the guitar textures and great playing on this album.  Charlie Sexton and the band make occasional musical nods to &quot;Highway 61&quot; (am I the only one who hears this?) and this CD reminds me of that recording, with it's scorching slide guitar and raw but controlled sound.  It's been a long time since Bob used a real working band he could make records with, usually it's various session men thrown together for the project... in contrast to that approach, on this record there is a band vibe and chemistry that you can really feel.  I've heard that touring with Dylan is not be the easiest gig in the world, but I think these guys must love Bob because they play so good for him.  <br />Another reviewer said it sounded like Dylan just showed up and laid down the vocals without being involved, I couldn't agree less -- this record was self-produced by Dylan and the performances sound full of life to me. Love and Theft has greatly renewed my appreciation of Bob Dylan -- he is in my opinion an American treasure and I hope he sticks around making music for many years to come.
0811826848|5.0|This is it - The Beatles, in their own words.  If you're a Beatles fan, and you're interested in the ideas behind the music and how the Beatles developed personally and artistically through the years, Anthology is for you; it doesn't get any better than this.     It's an intersting story and a great read, but what makes it special is its authenticity; you know you're getting the real story because it's the Beatles themselves who are telling it.    If you only have a casual Beatles interest, you may not find it quite as enjoyable, but for true fans the book is a fantastic treat.  A great pleasure to own &amp; enjoy!
B00003CXTG|2.0|I went to the theatre to see this disaster of a film knowing that I shouldn't expect a Saving Private Ryan.  I didn't expect the film to be some of the most painful movie-viewing hours of my existance.<BR>While the film had a few bright spots such as Dan Akroyd and Cuba Gooding, Jr., the point here would be that they were only spots.  These characters (who were based on real people), especially Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s, were more interesting than the three main characters.  Unfortunately, the movie wasn't about them, and their parts actually made the movie even more horrible by adding nothing to the already choppy storyline.  The most annoying of these wasted characters was Cuba Gooding Jr.'s, who seemed injected into the film just so that Bruckheimer could say &quot;Look, I put an important African-American in my movie!&quot;<BR>And then there was the love story.  One of the worst things about the love story was not that it was &quot;done&quot;, but that it was &quot;done&quot; in 1950s soap operas (even they have to come up with something more entertaining than the old love triangle nowadays).  The other is that it overshadowed the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This wouldn't bother me as much (I mean, these are the guys who made Armageddon, for crying out loud) except that the film was titled &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and was advertised as a war movie that was meant to honor those who served.  The soap opera love triangle could have happened in ANY scenario and did nothing more to honor our servicemen who fought than yesterday afternoon's episode of Days of Our Lives.<BR>If you are looking for mindless entertainment that feels like Armageddon, sure, this is your film.  If you want a movie that lives up to its advertising as a serious war epic, rent Tora! Tora! Tora! or Saving Private Ryan.  If you want something that is a good old-fashioned war movie, go find something with John Wayne in it.
B00005UKE0|5.0|George's post-Beatles album is a real treat!  He wrote many of the songs while still with the Beatles, but couldn't get them on a Beatles album because Lennon &amp; McCartney put their songs as first priority.  Here are those songs, performed by George with some help from friends such as Ringo and Eric Clapton.  This is one of the best, if not the best, solo album by an ex-Beatle.  I disagreed with George's comments on the sleeve where he says the album was overproduced by Phil Spector, I think the songs sound great even today, just as they were originally recorded.   If you liked George's later work while with the Beatles (on the White Album, Let It Be &amp; Abbey Road albums) you will probably enjoy this solo album.  <br />Rock on, George!
B00005QHSS|5.0|This is by far the best record I have ever heard. It contains a great deal of extras VS the normal \\"mutter\\" album...<br />1. The fold out pack itself is beautiful, and has a nice red tint to it (the normal album has a green tint). It also has a 3-D \\"R\\" logo in the front of the case.<br />2. Includes very well taken pictures of the band in action. The paper the photos are printed on is very interesting, odd, yet cool and unique. You'll have to get it to see (and feel) what I'm talking about.<br />3. A special \\"red tinted\\" booklet from the orignal Mutter album. No changes to it besides color.<br />4. What really makes this album \\"special\\" is the bonus cd. It contains 4 live tracks, adding up to 20 minutes. All of them are explosive, and are much more energy filled than the studio versions. The tracks show Rammstein is the best live band around.<br />So you get it all, the bonus tracks, the fold out digi pack, live photos, and explosive multi platinum music. <br />Is it worth the money? You bet! ...
B00005JKQX|5.0|As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is \\"real\\" to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's \\"reality\\" exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" starring Russell Crowe.<br /> Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose \\"Equilibrium n-tuple\\" is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably \\"different,\\" not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early `50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.<br /> One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's \\"life\\" we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.<br /> As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a \\"movie star,\\" but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.  <br /> After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" and \\"Waking the Dead\\"), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia.  Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.
B00000K19E|4.0|The person who wrote the picture quality technical information on this disc must have watched it on a 19&quot; tv where you won't notice the horrible banding due to the digital compression. It's aweful in the dark regions, which is most of the film. Put all the extras on second disc and use less compression. Well, I still liked it and the sound is amazing in 5.1 surround. Just don't watch it on a tv bigger than 30 something inches. A progressive scan dvd player may help. I'll revise this if it does.
6300267881|5.0|When it comes to horror, I've been there and done that.  Since the age of 11, I've rented as many horror movies as I possibly could - some I'm sure most people have never even heard of - and have RARELY been impressed.<br />Believe it or not, I didn't see The Exorcist until I was 19 years old.  Forget the standard methods of scaring the viewer - startling scenes, screaching music and lots of false alarms.  The Exorcist is just plain DISTURBING.  I could barely sleep the night I watched it, unable to get it out of my mind, and went straight to my parents' book collection to find the book the next day.<br />The Exorcist is an absolute classic - unparalleled.  If you're sick of the same old, same old horror films or are simply looking for a quality horror movie that will stay on your mind for days afterwards, this is the movie you're looking for.

0385505833|5.0|&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is obviously a walk on the light side for John Grisham. His presentation reminds me of the well known &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and not so well known &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. Like the above stories, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; cleverly informs an important contemporary issue through an easy, refreshing presentation.

In fact, they'll show their true colors by buying this book ------- for Christmas.

B00005RHGK|5.0|I've read numerous reviews on Jeepers Creepers with polar opposite appraisals and ratings.<BR>Surprisingly, some &quot;bottom-of-the-barrel&quot; judgements contain such in-depth and thorough analysis that bad movies could unlikely be worth of.<BR>Perhaps the people may have disliked the movie so much that they could hardly deny themselves a pleasure of trampling it to dust.<BR>No doubt the script has its loopholes and drawbacks.<BR>However I believe these mostly are for the sake of sustaining its headlong momentum.<BR>Some illogical and imprudent moves of the kids indeed contradict with the instinct of self-preservation.<BR>But both leads look credible enough, and some minor flaws in their motivation could be excused for curiosity.<BR>Anyway all this falls into a pattern of the genre.<BR>What else did you expect of a horror movie? If you hate the very idea of checking up the sewer pipe with two inquisitive (and good Samaritan) kids - don't waste your time and keep your bucks intact. <BR>Some reviewers are giggling at the habit of the flying creature to drive a truck - well, how on earth is the guy supposed to dump all these bodies - do you think he should transport them all by air?<BR>Then why aren't you amazed that the Creeper crawls along the wall?<BR>After all, why noone is surprised with the presence of demonic power in the movie - ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T EXIST!!!<BR>A REAL horror movie buff must have learnt to disengage oneself from such insignificances.<br />I'm a horror film addict and I think that real life beyond the doorway is much more frightening than the scariest movie.<BR>It's rather hard to devise something new and fresh which could satisfy and petrify the experienced viewer to the bone.<BR>But I didn't find so much resemblance with some earlier classic movies as many counted.<BR>Some cliche are purely unintentional - the nearly century-long hystory of horror movies has brought about so many different nasty characters - it could be a hell of a job to offer something brand new and refreshing to dedicated moviegoers. (I myself have found some similarities of the creature with J.P.Ouellette's Unnamable rather than with Terminator or Jason Voorhees - but who cares).<BR>My overall impression of this particular film - this is truly horrifying movie with a plenty of chilling moments and deserves a good rating.<BR>Not so many films of the last decade made me shiver like Jeepers Creepers did.<BR>To my opinion this one has major essential elements of a good horror movie - strong acting, impetuous pace, nice camerawork, decent FX, creepy score, believable dialogue and sense of humor and proportion.<BR>If you're looking for an extensive character study or logical motivations - try Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment instead.<BR>P.S. MGM has prepared a nice DVD package with really good DD5.1 sound scheme - those voices from the church's cellar reproduced from the rear speakers have knocked my socks off.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie Minogue's latest release is by far one of her best.The CD is even better than her 2000 release,&quot;Light Years&quot;.The CD gets you pumping with dance charged songs with awesome lyrics.It gets started with the club type song &quot;More,More,More&quot; and ends perfectly with the fun song &quot;Burning Up&quot;.Fever is the perfect CD for a party or to put you in a good mood.Kylie's music only gets better with each CD.Stand out tracks on this CD are &quot;Can't Get You Outta My Head&quot;,&quot;Your Love&quot;,&quot;Burning Up&quot;,and &quot;Fragile&quot;.Everyone who loves pop music must own this CD.
B000002NBY|5.0|I have a hard time deciding if Graceland isn't Paul Simon's best work. Take his first album (simply titled Paul Simon.) That was a breakthrough song fest when it came out in 1972. We were all sorry to see Simon and Garfunkel break up --would we ever see the likes of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; again? While Paul's solo work was different than the duo, who could resist those catchy and quirky songs? This was one of the great albums that debuted during pop and rock music's finest years (in my opinion) --the early 70's.<br /><br />When &quot;Graceland&quot; came out after the music's death by disco in the 80's, I was thrilled. At last, something great to listen to. What a sound! The mix of South African music with Simon's style of songwriting was unique and appealing. The deep, swooping tones of Ladysmith Black Mambazo make a wonderful contrast to Simon's light tones in the title cut. The typical Simon bouncing rhythm is vastly improved by the African mix. And Simon does the favor of introducing the great South African band, who went on to enjoy their own, richly deserved fame.<br />All in all, a great album that never fails to cheer me up.
B00004TL21|5.0|Deftones will probably always be one of my favorite bands. I've read many reviews about this being softer then Deftones' previous releases, and I agree, but that does not make it worse. Digital Bath is probably my second or third favorite song ever, in my vast collection. It is brilliantly written, and brilliantly sung, and sends chills down my spine when I listen to it. Actually, most of the songs on this album do. (Well, not literally.) Change and Passenger are probably the other two best tracks here, even though I personally enjoy every single one. (What could bve better than Maynard and Chino singing a duet?) This is a must have for anyone with ears. If you like this, I recommend buying Adrenaline and Around the Fur,and also Checking out Taproot, A Perfect Circle, and Tool, if you haven't already.
B00005TT77|3.0|I ran out and bought this cd today when I saw all the Beatles songs covered- finally, we might have a great cover cd of the greatest band of all time. Well, maybe not. To be fair, you can't expect any remakes to compare with the way The Beatles did them. That's actually one of the funny parts of covers- you realize how unbelievable the original artist was when you hear a so-so interpretation.<br />It starts off pretty well with a good version of &quot;Two of Us&quot; by Aimee Mann (of Magnolia fame and deservedly so) and Michael Penn. Sarah McLachlan comes next with a great version of &quot;Blackbird&quot; that sticks very close to the original. That's what I like to see- don't put too much of your own touch on it unless it's unbelievable, otherwise you ruin it. Rufus Wainwright strains a little too much on &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, and the Wallflowers absolutely crucify &quot;I'm Looking Thru You&quot;. Bad choice of a song to match Dylan's voice. Leave it to my favorite frontman Eddie Vedder to deliver a wonderful, true to original version of the late George Harrison's &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot;. The rest of the album is ok, standouts would be Sheryl Crow, Ben Folds and The Black Crowes (who knew they could do &quot;Lucy&quot; so well?) The remainder features some well known artists completely ruining the songs they are given. I was hoping for more here, but I can't see myself playing more than a handful of the songs here on a regular basis.<br />Kudos to the filmmakers and artists for putting this together though- it literally was done in weeks and only out of the goodness of the artists' hearts. <br />Not bad overall- but you just can't top the Fab 4.
B000002TYK|5.0|This is a must have for people who like music. I like each and every song on here. My favorites are ...ALL OF THEM. In my opinion this is the best foo fighters album, Even though the other 2 [soon to be 3] are also very good and probably also 4-5 star albums, and Everlong is one of my favorite songs ever. Anyways, Definately go pick this one up. If you like it, I suggest you get the other ones and get some Smashing Pumpkins albums.
B00005A46T|5.0|Once I put this cd into my cd player, i could not believe what i was hearing. This cd is absolutly amazing.

The first Slipknot cd was soo amazing, and i couldnt wait to hear their sophmore album, and i wasnt disapointed. Slipknot definately plays pulse pounding, edge of your seat raw nu-metal on this cd, bringing you along on their evil rollercoaster! This cd is amazing, buy it if you are a fan, you wont be dissapointed!
0446608955|4.0|If you a looking for a light, relaxing read, look no further! You have definitely found the right book. The best way to describe this novel is compare it to TV. It is the soap opera of the literary world. Anyone who enjoys any of the Oprah Book Club books would take pleasure in this novel. I would also recommend this book to any teenage girl looking to learn a thing or two about love. Although it was overall wonderfully written, I would not recommend this book to someone needing to do any type of book report or analysis. It is too much of a \\"light read\\" and does not go in depth enough. Even so, the plot is in many ways both compelling and heart warming. It is easy to get into, and really does touch your heart. It is not too deep nor does it require much thinking. It is by far, the perfect answer to a lazy Sunday afternoon! (Don't forget the tissues!)
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's not that the Strokes are ground breaking or something new, it's that they aren't really all that ground breaking that makes this album so excellent.  If you are a college student that doesn't have a radio, like myself, and have to resort to watching MTV and MTV2, you would find yourself getting washed in pop crap emo junk as a rock substitute.  I feel that the grunge revolution needs to comeback and the Strokes prove through gritty artistry that they are bringing back that feel as rock is dying at the hands of metal and emo.
B000055XMF|3.0|Firstly - was this mastered from the best negative available? If so, someone hadn't stored the tape very well - for instance, the opening scene has scratches &amp; mung all over it.<BR>But that's not my main gripe - like others on this page, I miss the scenes that have been cut out (why, Rhino?)<BR>I think I can remember 3 scenes....<BR>1. Jimmy singing &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; while franking letters (he mentions the franking machine later to his boss)<BR>2. A scene with Leslie Ash sitting at her till in the supermarket (there's a still of this in the &quot;extras&quot; section)<BR>3. Jimmy picking up his suit from the tailor (not sure about this one, but the Tailor does get a mention in the credits).<BR>I especially miss #1, as I do the same every time I see a franking machine!<BR>I was wondering if this was just on the American version since I'm English and first saw this movie on video in England and also because no-one on amazon.co.uk has made mention of any cut scenes.<BR>So, Rhino - what were you thinking? Did you think we wouldn't remember those scenes? Why weren't they included in the &quot;extras&quot; section?<br />UPDATE (14th Feb 2000) - just received an e-mail from Dr.Rhino (the place for questions on the Rhino web site) to my questions about the missing scenes.  Here's the reply:<br />&quot;We remastered the film from the original negative and there were no extra scenes . The licensor owns the film as it was released--we had access to that same film.&quot;<br />Therefore I can only assume that the US &quot;release&quot; was different from the original UK release.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Ok whether you pay attention to the media hype or not, this a great album. I have yet to meet anyone that can really discribe the sound, all I know is that this whole album is a good listen. THey sound out of the 60's at some times, and straight out of the mid 90's at others. But you have to love this album even if it simply is something different. In an era of Nickelback's and Creed's this band is actually ariginal (gasp!). So for all the music snobs who don't think this is original, go away, cause the pool of music you choose from is limited. So for people with open tastes and who are tired of the stuff on the radio, I urge you to get this ablum.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is one of those rare films that seems to get better with age.  The screenplay is one of the best, most streamlined vehicles ever -- every snatch of dialogue, every scene is vital, whether developing characterization or pushing the story forward, or performing both functions simultaneously.  <br />Hollywood simply does not make movies like this, with a bare minimum of music and beautiful women, and NO sentimentality whatsoever.  Compare Kubrick's Hollywood epic, Spartacus, with Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey (another masterwork without a superfluous scene).  Compare Dr. Strangelove with just about any Hollywood war movie, including Saving Private Ryan.  It's easy to see why Kubrick chose to shoot his films in England, albeit with American funding.  <br />Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott together turn in no fewer than 5 unforgettable performances in Dr. Strangelove.  (I'd seen this film at least a half dozen times before I realized that the American President is Peter Sellers with a bald-wig.)  <br />Kubrick's visual style is unforgettable and witty.  The decision to shoot the film in black and white, and the generic style of certain combat sequences, give Dr. Strangelove the realistic &quot;authority&quot; of a documentary war movie.  But this is the war movie to end all war movies -- and Dr. Strangelove, a certified box-office success in America, definitely helped to sever the 1950s from the 1960s.
0345347951|4.0|Never has SF produced another visionary as stirring as Arthur C. Clarke, and in &quot;Childhood's End&quot; Clarke presents a future breathtaking even when judged by the high standards he has set.  &quot;Childhood's End&quot; opens with mankind making its first contact with an alien race, a very dramatic contact, with giant ships hovering over the major cities of Earth and the alien leader Karellen announcing his stewardship over the governments of man.  Why the Overlords have arrived to steer mankind's destiny is unknown.  The direction in which they guide it and the profound metamorphosis of humanity that results are revealed as the drama unfolds.  <br />Clarke's novels are the epic poems of the 20th century, the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of the modern age, with the entire race of man as the hero and the conquering and mastery of the universe as its trial.  With a protagonist so broad Clarke has little space to devote to the development of individual characters.  The humans in &quot;Childhood's End&quot; are all fashioned from the same mold, brought out to advance certain plot lines and then discarded, and dredged up again when required.  Only the Overlord Karellen is developed to an extent such that the reader cares what befalls him.  <br />The fate which befalls humanity presents another problem for &quot;Childhood's End.&quot;  The novel is divided into three sections, the first describing Karellen's shepherding of Earth and the subsequent two tracing the evolution of man.  The first part of the triad is markedly better than the others; the evolution Clarke envisions is not convincingly argued, and one gets the impression that Clarke didn't find it very persuasive himself and had difficulty justifying it.  <br />Despite these flaws, &quot;Childhood's End&quot; remains an excellent novel.  The spreading of the action over several generations, with only one cast of characters being insufficient to encompass the entirety of man's development,evokes in the reader a sense of the grandiosity of Clarke's vision, capturing him and keeping him frantically turning pages to discover what wondrous future Clarke has planned for the human race.

Shakira is a poet, and this CD prove's it, Her english song's in the newer CDs are not translated by competent translators and they feal/sound more like backstreet music than real poetry. SHAKIRA IS A POET.End of story.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it was wonderful and my husband liked it too.  What a great \\"date\\" movie because it had something for both the men and the women.  Nice love scene for the women and fighting - gore for the men.<br />It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and at the end both of us wept like babies.  Very moving and well done.  I have never regretted paying for this set, not even for a minute.<br />It's a must see.
B00003CX5P|2.0|After all these reviews I've read with people giving this movie an undeserved 5 stars, I would like to weigh in with my own.<br />There's no doubt that the dvd is an impressive achievement with all kinds of special features. This is really the way dvds were meant to be authored, and stands up favourably with the best dvd publishers like Criterion.<br />However, I'd give the movie itself 1 or possibly 2 stars. It is simply the worst Star Wars movie ever, with more holes than Swiss cheese. Especially the rubbish concerning r2d2 and c3pio. Is anyone going to credibly believe that Darth Vader did not recognise his favourite robots after all this time? Unless you subscribe to the theory that DV was actually a triple agent who was secretly working for the rebellion...<br />And don't get me started on Jar Jar. It was racist, insulting and an utter waste of time, regardless of how many supercomputers and how many processing cycles they used rendering that waste of time.<br />To sum it up. It's a wonderful example of how dvd mastering should be, too bad the content stinks to high heaven.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|First of all let me start by saying, I'm 32 years old and I don't like Disney or any other kids movies much (with the exception of The Iron Giant, although I also enjoyed Toy Story 2). I took my nephews to see Shrek at the theater last summer and they absolutely loved it but much to my surprise I loved it too.<br />This is the movie that has made $472 m at the box office and has made $420 m in two months of DVD and video sales. This is the gift that everybody got for Christmas. This is the gift I gave everybody for Christmas. This is the DVD I got for Christmas and this is the movie I've seen about six times so far BUT it doesn't matter how many times you watch Shrek, it still amuses, it still entertains and it doesn't ever disappoint. It has that rare quality of appealing to both children and adults, which is extremely beneficial if you have kids who liked to watch movies over and over and over again.<br />It is a beautifully written send up of Disney films, fairytales, and other movies, with so many clever visual and verbal jokes; only some of which (thankfully) kids will understand. All of which adults (with a sense of humour) will love. It is a perfectly cast movie with Mike Myers voicing the mild-mannered ogre Shrek and Eddie Murphy in his best form for many a year as his sidekick donkey. John Lithgow stars as the villain Lord Farquaad and Cameron Diaz voices the feisty Princess Fiona. They are all magnificent but it was a stroke of genius to cast Myers and Murphy together as they spark off each other and excel with comic ad-libs.<br />Whats more the extras on this DVD are just magnificent. There are games, deleted scenes, behind the scenes stuff, hilarious fake interviews etc. etc. and with reported sales of the DVD worldwide, at 10m and rising, Dreamworks have put together a fantastic package and really hit the jackpot. I don't know anybody, young or old who doesn't like this movie and for once I'm pretty happy to be in the majority.
B000003RCY|5.0|after i got sehnsucht, i was so blown away by it i went and <BR>picked up this album. herzleid is quite a bit 'crunchier', and<BR>although it's not any heavier than the other albums, it's more<BR>agressive. there's not a whole lot i can say about it, so i guess<BR>i'll describe the songs-<BR>1. wollt ihr das bett in flamen sehen- starts out with a cool<BR>keyboard driven pattern that breaks into the same pattern on <BR>the duel guitars. awesome writing on this song, the way it's put<BR>together. heavy, but not their heaviest. still a good song to <BR>get hooked on rammstein with.<BR>2. der meister- one of the fastest songs rammstein has ever done,<BR>it has an awesome main riff, and the vocals are wicked how the<BR>music stops so he can sing a line then picks up the fast main <BR>riff again. cool all the way through, still not a 'heavy' one.<BR>3. weisses fleisch- opens with a keyboard increasing in speed,<BR>then a drum beat, then till screams &quot;weisses fleisch!&quot;. probably<BR>the most morbid lyrics they've ever done. it's about going into<BR>a school yard and raping and killing people. don't look down on<BR>the lyrics, it's a wicked song.  one of their heaviest, and <BR>probably one of the best live. AWESOME solo from richard in it.<BR>4. asche zu asche- a sweet little diddy about crucifixion. the<BR>dude gets crucified, then comes back as a god and crucifies the<BR>dude that did it to him. main riff sounds a little like der <BR>meister slowed down. the best part of it is when the last verse<BR>bleeds into the last chorus- &quot;and i stick my finger in your...<BR>ashes! to ashes!&quot; GREAT song.<BR>5. seemann- a ballad about a sailor. most beautiful bass line<BR>ever. the only 'light' 'pretty' song on the record. still wicked.<BR>6. du riechst so gut- &quot;you smell so good&quot;. as far as i can tell<BR>it's about a stalker. really cool keyboard. another good one<BR>live. <BR>7. das alte leid- &quot;the old grief&quot;. a slow, mesmerizing song. <BR>idon't know how to describe this one, you just gotta hear it.<BR>this one proves they don't have to go &quot;all out&quot; to be brutal.<BR>8. heirate mich- &quot;marry me&quot;. catchies, coolest, best written<BR>song on the album, not to mention the one with the sickest <BR>lyrics. i love it. it's about a dude that falls in love with a <BR>chick, she dies, and he digs up her body... the rest is history.<BR>one of the best songs they've ever done.<BR>9. herzeleid- best written song they've ever done. there is <BR>three beats, then a word, then three beats and a word, and so on.<BR>it's actually a very beautiful song. the lyrics go along the <BR>lines of &quot;every minute we spend together is precious, time is<BR>short, my heartache is great&quot;. something like that. heavy as<BR>hell, and an instant rammstein-classic. also the best song live.<BR>10. Laichzeit- &quot;spawning time&quot;. this song has the best music on<BR>the whole album. it's actually about incest, but you get used to<BR>that. &quot;he liebt de schwester&quot;- he loves his sister...ya know...<BR>the keyboard in this song is amazing. if you download one song,<BR>let this be it. heavy and fast as hell, scathing vocals and <BR>lyrics. another classic.<BR>11. rammstein- another very slow, very brutal song. he says <BR>&quot;rammstein&quot;, then says a line of the song. i dunno what to <BR>say except &quot;brutal&quot;. got a GREAT solo by richard at the end. <BR>actually written as a tribute to the 90 (or so) people that were<BR>killed at Rammstein airforce base during an air show. the lyrics<BR>are morbid and beautiful at the same time.<br />all around, this is an amazing album. no matter what you listen<BR>to, pick up this album, there is something for everyone. never<BR>have i seen this much musical talent packed in 1 album. truly<BR>a classic.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Guy Pearce gives an excellent performance as Leonard Shelby, a man trying to find the people who brutally raped and murdered his wife and left him unable to make new memories, in this complex thriller told backwards by writer-director Christopher Nolan.<br />Because of his condition Leonard has to continually keep notes, on paper, with polaroids but also with tattoos and notes written on his body, as his only ways of retaining any new information. From day to day he has to rely on his notes to remind him of his progress and trust that they are correct. His life is permanently lived in present-tense and his only purpose is to find those responsible for his wife's murder.<br />What makes this movie really intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat is the fact that the story is told from the end backwards, each segment of the movie revealing a little bit more of what has previously happened. Who is a friend who is an enemy? This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing. I saw this movie at the theatre and what made it a great movie first time, apart from the excellent story and excellent acting from all concerned, is the surprise element and whilst if you are watching this movie for the first time it really is a rewarding experience, my concern with buying it on DVD, is that like many great thrillers it's maybe not so good for repeated viewings. Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie. I just feel that once you know the end of the movie (the beginning of the story) it might not hold the same allure (or your attention) second or third time around. If you haven't seen it though and you like slow-burn, complex, intelligent thrillers, this comes highly recommended and will hopefully bring Guy Pearce an Oscar nomination. If you are looking for something upbeat or fast paced this wont be for you...mination. If you are looking for something upbeat or fast paced this wont be for you...
B00003CXB2|3.0|I think that half of the enjoyment of this film is missed as it is shown on TV. The beautiful desert landscape where the most part of it takes place is impaired by the size of TV screen where it is turned in an ordinary film. I think it doesn't work suitably out of the cinema screen.
B0000399WI|5.0|What can you say about The Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said? It must be one of the best loved and indeed greatest films ever made. I do not know anybody that has seen this film that doesn't LOVE it. It really is that superb.<br />Adapted from Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an outwardly timid man convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and jailed for life. Arriving at Shawshank prison in 1947, Andy becomes the victim of prison brutality in the early part of his stay but he also befriends another lifer, the prison \\"fixer\\"  named Red (beautifully played by Morgan Freeman) and his buddies. Through his knowledge of taxation and financial transactions he also becomes popular with the prison warden and the guard that runs his brutal regime but Andy also soon realises that in prison life means life and that's what they try to take from him.<br />This is the most beautiful and ultimately uplifting film you could ever hope to see, whilst recognising the traditional conventions of prison drama (such as brutality and rape), it is really a film that demonstrates that the human spirit can overcome brutality with faith, friendship (and a rock hammer). This is as close to the perfect film as you will ever get. It is perfectly cast from the leads Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who give wonderfully understated performances to the supporting cast of Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Bob Gunton and Gil Bellows. It is subtly directed by Frank Darabont who carefully manages to avoid overstatement and oversugaring the cake with sentiment and pathos.<br />The most amazing thing about this film is that although it was nominated for seven academy awards in 1994 it didn't win any (they were dominated by Forrest Gump) and it is described in Leonard Matlin's film guide as \\"terribly overlong\\", \\"hollow and predictable\\". How wrong could you be? The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless all-time classic that will cast its spell over many people for a long long time to come.<br />Five stars are often too easily awarded by movie reviewers but this deserves six.assic that will cast its spell over many people for a long long time to come. <br />Five stars are often too easily awarded by movie reviewers but this deserves six.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Warm up the corn bread, pour up some lemonade, and pop in &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; into your CD player.<br />I didn't expect to like the music so much. I'm a rock fan. Zeppelin, Queen, Bowie... but country music as folksy as a front porch in June? Absolutely!<br />What &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; has going for it is tradition. Garth might have a lot going on, but those Soggy Bottom boys are where it's at. Singing the old songs to an audience who never heard them, musicians from Allison Krause, to Norman Blake, to the Cox family sing the songs which our grandfathers hummed back in the 1930s and earlier.<br />You saw the movie. It might not be Clooney singing, but what you heard is on the album. I have no idea why my local DJ didn't pick up on the quality, and play them. Maybe they were afraid that some of these are old hymns. However, here they are!<br />I fully recommend &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl

If you would talk of luck in the entertainment bussiness, talk of these persons.<br />When you first hear Enya, you would think it's just music for old people. Because of the classic music in it. You will become a fan as soon as you listen to the CD. (I'm 19). Enya is beyond great. And you'll notice that as soon as you hear songs like \\"One By One\\", \\"Only Time\\". She shows that she doesn't care much about anything than the music she produces. Enya has some songs where she don't even sings. Her success is too small.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|I am not a person who likes to complain, but this film is too OVERRATED! It is not that funny by any measure (I personally don't think it's funny at all) and it's DEFINITELY not inspired...the plot is scattershot beyond any reason or good sense. Even Mike Myers of whom I am a fan seems to be going through the motions without much inspiration.For such technology-heavy projects it should perhaps not come as a surprise that the plot is not the main focus, but after watching the 5-star TOY STORY 2,one cannot be satisfied with Shrek.I'd be disappointed if an adult considered Shrek's humour top class; he obviously has not discovered the Monty Python magic.

For the Apollo 13 DVD I can say that it is just great, all the sound and image quality you expect, you get it. I can't say the same for the Backdraft DVD, because it has no special features to enjoy. In general terms the pack is good, but that is because of the Apollo 13 DVD only.

In a lot of cases, this doesn't happen. <br />[....]<BR>The quality is reasonably good as well.

I would like to have seen more special features.Overall this is a must have not for the DVD content and features, but for the movie itself and what it represents to all its fans.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book for my english class next semester.  What a funny yet completely honest main character.  The tales the narrator tells make you laugh and cringe.  I felt bad for the fella, but he had a wonderful attitude that helped him get through all situations.  I would definately recommend this book to anybody who likes to hear a good story.
0064409422|4.0|This is such an awesome novel! I know its weird that I choose this book over the winter break because it is such a popular book that I bet kids age of 11 all have already read it but I seriously enjoyed it. <BR> My favorite characters were Peter and Edmund. Peter was the oldest son of the Pevensie. He was a noble and courageous young man because he saved his sister, Susan from a wolf. He was crowned as the high king of Narnia because of his braveness. In the first half of the book, Edmund was very spiteful but his character changes halfway through the novel. I choose Edmund as one of my favorite characters because he started off as a bad guy kind of but in the end, eyeing some evidences he realizes his wrong dedications to the white witch and simply becomes more alert and makes the right decisions.<BR> My least favorite character was of course the evil queen of Narnia because she placed a spell on Narnia that it is endless winter and never Christmas. She had a wand that when she swooshes it, it turns creatures and humans into stone and it also makes Turkish delight that poisons Edmund greedy.<BR> Just like any novels, bad people always end up in a bad way.

It nearly defines what the ritm and cool benson sound has to be. Turnout the lamplight and put this cd on your player and simply close your eyes..discover the magic sound of Mr. Benson. I recommend every title of George Benson but Give me the Night and Weekend in L.A. are something special. Don't spend time here on reading hurry up and buy this cd.
B00003CXN4|3.0|I think my feeling is that of a general consencious .The scenes with Michael Douglas are not good at all ,you have to really suspend disbelief ,although I liked the performance by His daughter (Christensen) even if i don't believe the situations were really possible .I also thought no one is gonna believe a woman is gonna go to that lengths to stay in the same lifestyle,especially since i lived in La Jolla for a few years it takes the cake in blandness .Kudos though to 3 great performances  Luis Guzman Don Chealde and most of all Benecio Del Toro .Del Toro gives what is the best performance IMHO in the last 2 or 3 years of anyone male or female .There are many things to like about this movie also many things to dislike you can disect this movie too tidpits and you will still come to the same conclusions.All in all a little bit of a letdown but still worth more than all the oscar nominess of last years .If i was the ebert guy i guess i would have to give this one a big thumb up and a big thumb down
B000050FEN|4.0|'Se7en' returns the crime thriller to Edgar Allen Poe, inventor of the detective story.  In his tales featuring the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, Poe dubbed the criminal and the detective, the 'creative' and the 'resolvant' - the criminal creates a crime like a work of art; the detective analyses and interprets it like a critic.  In 'Se7en', John Doe's serial killing has an aesthetical form - not only does he pattern it according to an overarching structure; not only does the method of each crime connect thematically to its sin; but each is an elaborate, meticulously-staged tableau which the detectives must read before they can understand it and proceed.  The thrller hinges on whether the detectives are good critics - William Somerset, who deals in dedicated scholarship, absorbing the primary texts, is; the younger Mills, who skimps with 'Cliff's Notes', isn't.<br />A second model in 'Se7en' is Dante's 'Divine Comedy', which screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker reverses.  Somerset is Virgil, the teacher full of cultural and ethical knowledge who should bring his student, Mills as Dante, to progressive understanding and enlightenment.  Rather than moving heavenwards, however, 'Se7en' is a slow ride to Hell, beginning with the Purgatorial Sin nearest to Heaven, Gluttony, and working down through the rest.  The ultimate goal facing the student is not achieving redemption but avoiding damnation.  Although New York might seem like a living hell - a medieval inferno plagued by random violence, apathy, noise, decay, rain, lonely rotting lives - it is really a Purgatorial testing-ground; but Somerset is a bad teacher, Mills an inattentive student.  <br />Then there is Borges, who, in stories such as 'Death and the Compass', used the detective format and the 'clues' to be read in Great Literature, to destroy the ethical assumptions of forms and identity.<br />'Se7en' is the kind of film that only seems a masterpiece on first viewing, when shock, suspense and novelty replace our critical faculties.  As such, its effect is immediate and gut-wrenching, as the film flatters our intellect without making any demands on it.  But as would become apparent in his later films, director Fincher always pulls back from being truly radical, and what seems to be a hopeless, dank, inexorable, anti-Hollywood apocalyptic vision is actually as reassuring as the most conservative detective novel: unlike Borges, it retains a faith in patterns, taking them to their logical conclusions, giving some sort of meaning, no matter how bleak to chaos.  Despite Somerset's protests, Doe is too reassuringly, articulately psychotic to suggest a projection of inner evil, remorse or Biblical vengeance (indeed, the film might be a moral story about man's hubris in replacing God).  The script contrivances (as in imaginative short-cuts, rather than failures in plausibility) become increasingly apparent.<br />The best directors - from Hitchcock to Ray to Soderbergh - are also Critics, interrogating the scripts they film, but Fincher seems content to reproduce Walker's pretentious gloom and thematic timidity - even the grungiest scenes are filmed with exquisite symmetry and loving detail.  The script itself queasily reproduces Doe's moral censoriousness, punishing in kind a woman who simply contemplated abortion.  The film is full of beautiful compositions (the brutally ironic torchlights in the opening investigation; the neon blue as they check out the 'Help Me' fingerprints); exciting set-pieces (the first chase of Doe; the wracking final 20 minutes); and gruesome moments (the jerk of a flayed victim).  The acting is terrific, especially Brad Pitt in his first great performance, using his good-looking cockiness to devastating effect, in many ways more complex and sympathetic than Morgan Freeman's earnest elder cop, with his intriguingly failed past and sterile present.  As a whole, however, I don't think 'Se7en' holds up.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This campy unnatural telling of the simplest of love stories does not rise to the promised bohemian heights of beauty, freedom, truth and love. Nevertheless, a triumph of style over substance is still a triumph of sorts.  Don't forget to check out the green fairy!

These 2 charecters Hawke and Delpy say the thing's we either wish we could say or would absolutely never say.One question i had was with the rating no violence or nudity and only mild langauge should have given it p or p13.Too many memorable scenes in this movie none really stand out, all in all  one of the best of the 90's .
B000007NYS|5.0|Lucinda is the most amazing singer/songwriter I have ever listened to.  Her lyrics strike a chord within me and sends me back to my days spent in Mississippi.  She captures the beauty and heartache of love that we all can identify with.  Then sends a shiver down your spine with her haunting voice.
B000021XS0|5.0|I was really turned off by Images and Words, but I decided to give the band another try. So I got this. Beatiful album! I have hope for this band. There's still a lot of instrumental stuff, but there's more focus on singing. I like it. Jordan Rudess also perked the band up. Despite it's length(78 minutes), it feels like it whizzes by. Also, Mike Portnoy is an excellent drummer. Up there with Neil Peart. Very exciting, emotional, and good album! Favs:Through Her Eyes, Beyond This Life, Home, and One Last Time.

0345451325|5.0|I bought a copy of Halo with my Xbox a while back.  And i wanted to know how it all came to be.  My hopes were answered when this book was released.  I didn't know if it would be good or not and I had my doubts.  But I loved the game so I went to the nearest bookstore and purchased it.  And I am about half way through it right now and I have to tell you that this is one of the best books ever.  I love it!  If you are thinking about buying it then do so because you wont be dissapointed.  Unless you don't like sci-fi novels.  So if you want to know the back story on the game Halo, then don't hesitate and pick this book up now!

B00005OAIE|5.0|A friend sent me a tape with the Dave Matthew's Band's &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; on one side and John Mayer's &quot;Room for Squares&quot; on the other. It is has been in my tape deck ever since - that's four months! I am a dyed in the wool Dave fan, but I figure Dave would approve of the shared space. I love both equally now and cannot wait until John Mayer hits the shelves again! In the meantime, I've recommended this one to lots of my friends and all of them have come back smilin'. It is a truly enjoyable CD and it does not need deeper lyrics or a more sophisticated band, as Mr. Wright would have one believe. It is just perfect the way it is
B00004KD1L|5.0|To look at the two artists on the inside cover, I thought they were just some &quot;young slacker types&quot; just out to make music, and not necessarily &quot;intelligent&quot; music at that.  However, after a few listens, I realized I was very wrong.  I'd equate this CD with Crystal Method's Vegas, but I'd also consider this a more intelligent and &quot;fine quality&quot; CD in comparison.  The first two tracks are very interesting, with a combination of a jazzy/electronica feel.  Track three (Dusk You &amp; Me) is very beautiful, and the piano work is delicate, and almost dreamy at times.  Track 5, &quot;If Everybody Looked the Same&quot;.... &quot;we'd get tired of lookin' at each other...&quot; ..... while a somewhat dorky refrain, you cannot deny the infectious beat, which is definite &quot;club material&quot;.  Track 9, &quot;At the River&quot; is another very &quot;interesting&quot; song, with a hint of Burt Bacharach kinda lounge to it...  My favorite track however is Track 10, &quot;In My Bones&quot;.  The beat is VERY funky.  Overall, this is a very well-executed CD, with enough divergent types of music that it doesn't sound repetitive, and keeps the CD interesting.

0446608955|2.0|Boo-woo...is the sound you definitely won't be making while reading Nicholas Sparks' A Walk to Remember.  If you enjoy shmaltzy love stories, this novel would be right up your alley.  As for me, I thought this novel was typical, unrealistic, and clich.  With a typical &quot;boy meets girl, boy likes girl&quot; story line, it was easy for me to fall asleep.  Besides the lack of originality in the plot, it was also highly unrealistic.  At the end of the book the two teenagers who are supposedly in love get married!  Come on, to all those parents out there, would you ever let this happen to your kid?!  Everything about the book was fantasy.   An immature teenage boy who cares deeply about his reputation falls in love with the Bible-loving class dork after spending a great deal of time with her while rehearsing for the school play?  Huh?  I know it sounds long and exhausting and that is exactly what it is.  As I got more into the book, the story line just kept getting tiring and I was getting more exhausted reading it.  The plot was milked for all it could be and that is what made the novel an ultimate bore.  When I finished the book, I was stunned that it took 236 pages to write such a predictable love story.  Listen to me, folks!  A Walk to Remember puts the &quot;sap&quot; in &quot;sappy&quot;!  Hmm... this book would probably fancy all those out there who actually like to be bored.  As for me, when reading a novel, I like to be stimulated by the plot and kept interested throughout the beginning to the end.  This book definitely didn't fulfill that job.  A Walk to Remember is definitely a book to remember...NOT TO  BUY!

0446608955|5.0|I saw a preview for the movie &quot;A Walk To Remeber&quot; and thought it was interesting, so I decieded to pick up the book and read it before I can watch it. From the first few pages, I was drawn into story. Little did I know that I would stay up past midnight to finish reading the book because I couldn't put it down. I know it's a cliche, but I had to read it all the way through. I couldn't wait till the next day. I loved the sincerity of the main character, Landon, and how he goes through a transformation. It is a story about faith and love, and this one not only brought tears to my eyes, but made me re-evaluate how I live my life.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I heard the hype long before the album, and the worship in the press left me cold, so I ignored this band for a long time. Finally stumbled across them again, actually took a listen, and bam--I was hooked. I don't know who they do or don't sound like, don't care about the fawners or the cynics--all I know, and all I want to know, is that this album excites the hell out of me. I had to go for a walk after the first time I listened to it, just to burn off the energy. Something in these songs is just electrifying, and I have to say that the lack of any reverb or over-production is refreshing (has anyone else begun to feel the crystal-clear, overcompressed sound of today's big-budget records drifting further away from reality?). Only fools waste time debating the band's significance or qualifications to be the current/next big thing. If there's one thing this album is about, it's the present moment, and in this moment, it's been a long time since an album made me sit up and take notice like this one does.
B000005RMY|5.0|See my reviews on Floodland and  First and Last and Always<br />I find this record really good as a historical perspective on the evolution of<BR>AE and the SOM.  I find it more dancey than to my taste (more of the flavor of the song 'First and Last and Always' versus the operatic quality of Floodland) but there are some very strong showings in the ancient SOM catalogue.<br />The cover of Gimme Shelter is netherworldly.  Someone play this on a wedding day.  That'd be so awesome.  <br />Other high poitns are Temple of Love, Kiss the Carpet, Adrenochrome, and Floorshow (IMHO).  <br />Must buy.

B00005QIPH|4.0|I toiled for over a month on whether I should buy this CD or not. It kept nagging at me and mocking me as I would pass it by, invariably pick it up, then put it back. So last week when I saw it on sale I thought well ok then, I will give it a whirl.<br />I had heard all the buzz from the UK about these guys and then started hearing \\"Last Night\\" which is currently getting a bunch of air-time. There was certainly something familiar about the sound but twisted around a bit ...couldn't figure it out really.<br />So, I have now given it 4 ample listens and I have decided that although perhaps it may not be \\"The Next Nirvana\\" as I heard touted, it is very good retro-pop.<br />\\"Last-Night\\" is this bizarre mix of very old Tom Petty, Lou Reed and a lucid New York Dolls. The rest of the CD holds up to that as well with a dash of Iggy and the Stooges. So, I suppose it could be called glam meets rock with a punk streak.<br />It sounds like a strange combination and it is, but it is different from anything out there right now. It's new, but it's old. Certainly full of catchy hooks and I do find it rather pleasant to hear a new CD not saturated with electronica and synthesized bass....sort of back to the basics.<br />Three stars seems too small of a rating but 4 seems to large..I guess 3 and 1/2 maybe, it's not a bad CD, not by any means. Let's put it this way, if you love Velvet Underground and NY Dolls, chances are, you'll love this. If you like Iggy and the Stooges, it will be a worthwile purchase. If you like nothing to do with the above...don't do it.<br />This might actually be IT, but I am still not sure.
B00003CXFG|5.0|With the run of lackluster sci-fi flicks that came out one-after-another that year (Red Planet, Wing Commander, Super Nova, Battlefield Earth, Mission to Mars) -PITCH BLACK was bliss! Not that you are certain to agree... In fact, there's been a division of opinion on this movie. From what I've witnessed, you love it or hate it. I personally find that it rather easily takes it's place among my top-ten sci-fi favorites. And when you take into account its miniscule budget and unknown cast... this is quite a feat.<br />The plot could have used some tweaking, but the acting was quite solid, and I really enjoyed the characters, whose conflicts with each other (and within themselves) were engrossing. -Not to mention Vin Diesel, who makes a fine definition for the term &quot;bad-...&quot;. Thanks to him, I found myself saying &quot;whoa!&quot; many times during this movie. He has quite a future ahead of him, I think, but his growl-of-a-voice (while very cool) needs captions -because you can't make out what he is saying at times.<br /><br />The special effects were tasteful and in no way overdone -one of my biggest complaints in most sci-fi flicks. And although some found it too distracting, I thought the grainy camera filtering gave Pitch Black a nice gritty feel. It worked so well- I felt like I was trapped on the desert planet with them.<br />In short, this flick hit my buttons quite nicely! If you liked Aliens- Definitely give Pitch Black a shot!
B00005U11Z|5.0|Finally, a Journey DVD is released! I have to say that this is probably one of the best live videos ever created. It is great not just because it involves the best rock band of all time, but the DVD gives you flawless performance and production.<br />This DVD features a Las Vegas, NV concert that was performed a few months before Journey's release of their 2001 album &quot;Arrival&quot;. After watching it in its entirety, I was astounded at the perfection displayed throughout the entire band. Steve Augeri (the new lead vocalist) has permanently established himself as Journey's front man. He practically nails every high note! That is very difficult for a vocalist to do without a little help with post-production. He also is so intent about keeping the song true to its original recording. Neal Schon is (as always) a master with the lead guitar. Incredible energy and harmony is given in each song...including his solo! Ross Valory (bass) is a mixture of attitudes on stage: sometimes he acts reserved and intense in his performance and other times he's smiling and make funny gestures to the other guys in the band. Despite those observations, his bass guitar playing is crisp, clear, and perfect! Jonathan Cain completely showcases all of his talents in this DVD performance. Here, he plays keyboards, piano, and guitar, plus sings backup vocals! The man proves that he is a comprehensive and total musician. Lastly, Deen Castronovo (drummer) is just insane...in a good way! While his drumming is superb and unblemished with each song, he gives the songs more of a hard rock edge. His movements seem blistering and furious, but they are controlled, making the drums powerful and accurate.<br />The set list for this concert DVD was excellent. All of the hits are played with a few exceptions. Some bonus songs are included such as &quot;La Raza Del Sol&quot; from the band's box set. This is the only recorded live performance of this song that I am aware of, and it is done well. Another bonus song is &quot;Fillmore Boogie&quot;. This one will rock the socks off you! It is an explosive, intense rocker that features the band jammin' on guitars and drums...no lyrics (I guess Steve needs a break sometime!).<br />There are some extra features such as band member biographies and a photo gallery. The sound quality is AWESOME! Using Dolby 5.1, this DVD is incredible to listen to. The production of the sound, lighting, and video techniques in this concert and DVD was done with astounding quality. With this DVD scoring A-pluses on all marks, get it whether you're a hardcore Journey fan or just a rock enthusiast.

B00005QK3W|5.0|As someone said before, you need to take a few listens before you fall in love with this album, but once you do, you won't regret it.  Wonderful!
B00005QXDD|5.0|Sometimes it seems like every great album to be released over the past few years has been created by a melodramatic king of depression.  Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, all the talented acts that manage to worm their way to the mainstream as of late take themselves very seriously.  This isn't a necessarily a bad thing (who doesn't love dramatic music?), it's just a thing.<br />But now, for people who need to laugh, here is Tenacious D.  Fronted by comic actor Jack Black, this groovy, hard-rocking &quot;folk metal&quot; band amazes on all levels.  Songs like Double Team and Tribute will make you laugh out loud at their absurdity and revel in their musical prowress all at once.  Tenacious D does not take itself seriously by any stretch of imagination; Jack Black isn't here to make you feel his pain, he is here to entertain you, and dammit, what more can you ask for?<br />Drawing from everything from Led Zeppelin to folk music to 70s funk, there is never any doubt that this band loves music.  The arrangement of musicians Jack Black and Kyle Gass have rounded up for the creation of this CD is truly impressive.  One of the more recognizable names, Dave Grohl (who has not been involved with music of this calibur since the days of Nirvana) did an excellent job providing drum beats for the harder songs of the album such as The Road and Rock Your Socks.  The album's narrative finale City Hall will have you cracking up as it tells a story that would almost have a political message if it weren't so ridiculous.  As the song winds to a close, all you'll want to do is start the album over for another whirl.<br />Catchy, talented, and most of all, fun, Tenacious D is not an album you'll want to miss, regardless of whether or not you think Jack Black is a funny actor.  Forget about The Strokes, this album is the victor as the greatest debut album of 2001.<br />- Steve
B000021Y7X|4.0|You've heard it all before...&quot;Sense&quot; is the best concert film ever made, and one of the greatest rock films ever.  And the most uncanny thing about all of these claims is that they're absolutely true.  &quot;Sense&quot; is a terrific film...a perfect snapshot of an eclectic, ingenious rock band at their peak, filmed as if it were a feature film and not a concert video.  Demme's insistence on long shots of the band members works wonders...it allows the performance to breathe and gives a bird's eye view of the festivities.  Cronewith's cinematography is spellbinding...I'm reminded of the blood red background and eerie fog of &quot;Swamp,&quot; which perfectly suits this demonic song delivered in cackly baritone by Byrne.  Or the incredible shot during the coda of &quot;Once In A Lifetime&quot; of backup singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt leaning *very* far back as keyboardists Jerry Harrison and Bernie Worrell jam and Byrne proselytizes to the audience, clad in hornrims and scientist coat.  Mabry and Holt look like androids as they reel up to a standing position, perfectly in sync, while Harrison and Worrell are shrouded in a peculiar fog that makes them look as if they are floating on clouds.  And Byrne's neurotic tics and bent genius lead the way.  An incredible moment in an incredible film.<br />And of course there's the music.  It is certainly one of the best live performances ever captured on tape, by one of the best bands of all time (though, to be fair, a certain amount of post-production overdubbing was engaged in by the band members in 1984).  While not *flawless* (Harrison makes a few synth flubs near the end of &quot;This Must Be The Place,&quot; for one), it is breathtaking and captures T Heads at their absolute peak.  A bit of a greatest hits show, with some highlights from their then current album &quot;Speaking In Tongues,&quot; the music all hangs together wonderfully.  The extended lineup all cook on funky numbers like &quot;Crosseyed And Painless&quot; and &quot;What A Day That Was,&quot; scorch the earth on the new wave gospel of &quot;Slippery People&quot; and treat more somber numbers like &quot;This Must Be The Place&quot; with a gentle, human sensitivity.  <br />And of course, there is the absolute highlight and centerpiece of the film (at least in this reviewer's opinion): the double whammy of &quot;Burning Down The House&quot;--T Heads' then current hit--and &quot;Life During Wartime.&quot;  These two performances are like manna from heaven...the band all hit their marks perfectly.  In &quot;House,&quot; Worrell burns the synth to the ground with bizarre noises and funky fills...Byrne, Weir and Harrison all give a driving guitar rhythm...Harrison, Mabry and Holt mirror dance while Weir and Byrne drip with sweat.  Percussionist Steve Scales dances around and even finds time to give the camera a silly mug.  In &quot;Wartime,&quot; Byrne plays at being aerobic instructor.  His sinewy, bizarre movements and jogging in place give the song an energy that never lets up.  Exhilarating for band and audience alike.<br />And herein lies the charm of this film...nine players on stage, of different races, genders and personality types, all coming together to give one incredible performance.  All are represented at one time or another in the film.  There are also some great bonus materials, such as a self-interview with David Byrne, where he masquerades as several different characters interviewing himself in the big suit, and gives suitably Byrne-esque pseudo-intellectual answers (he answers at least three of the questions with &quot;I'll tell you later&quot;).<br />The sound of the DVD itself is quite nice, though fans of the original film and video will need to get used to the new 5.1 mixes.  I personally prefer the &quot;studio mix,&quot; which, ironically, sounded much more &quot;live&quot; to me than the &quot;feature film&quot; mix.  <br />So then, why do I give this DVD only four stars instead of five?Well, frankly, there are some aspects of the disc itself that are a bit disappointing.  The transfer itself looks okay, but I'd only give it three and a half stars out of five.  There are little white flecks occasionally, and a few very egregious flaws, most noticeable when Mabry, Holt and Scales first emerge on stage (there are marks that scroll up and down the screen for a few seconds).  There are also a few scenes where the holes in the top right side of the screen (which are used in theatrical prints to denote a scene change) haven't been digitally edited out.  Also, without explanation, some lines in the movie have been changed.  Near the end of &quot;Place,&quot; where Byrne once uttered a cheery &quot;uh-huh!&quot; into the mic, it has been replaced with the same exact &quot;hey!&quot; he delivers later.  Frantz's &quot;too much of that g** damn snow white...all night!&quot; during &quot;Genius&quot; has been replaced with the wholly inoffensive &quot;and everything's just jumpin' outta sight...all night.&quot;  Quite why they decided to change these lines is not known, and, in the case of Byrne's &quot;hey!&quot; just seems downright bizarre.<br />The last irritating aspect is the fact that the bonus songs are on a separate track, so that once you enter that section following the film, you can't skip back into the film.  Furthermore, I don't understand why they were cut in the first place.  They were in the running order of the videocassette for years, and are terrific performances in and of themselves, so why not leave them in for the DVD release?  But, as Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap once said, &quot;that's nitpicking, isn't it?&quot;<br />If you're a fan of Talking Heads, the 1980s, music, fine films or art, you must have this in your collection.  All gripes aside, it's an incredible piece of filmmaking that will stand the test of time and remains fresh after almost 20 years.  Certainly the best concert film ever made (yes, I said it again), and the second greatest rock film ever made (behind &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;).  Five + stars for the film, four for the DVD.
B0000041TD|5.0|I confess this was the first time I'd heard this recording of THE opera, &quot;La Boheme,&quot; and now I don't think I'll ever be able to tolerate another.  The little details are the best part, like the way Karajan holds Pavarotti at that high C in &quot;Che gelida manina,&quot; or the snake-charming lustiness of Eliazbeth Harwood's &quot;Quando men vo.&quot;  I could go on for a long time; fact is, everybody's great, down to the smallest role.  The quality of the recording itself is just so-so, but with so much talent, both on stage and in the pit, that's just not a problem. Buy this and you'll love it, I promise.
B00000IL1K|5.0|The variety of songs here is probably the most attractive feature of the CD for those who appreciate Sarah Brightman's ethereal, angelic voice.  And it's probably the least attractive feature for those whose musical enjoyment is sharply concentrated on one type of music.  In describing her voice on this record as ethereal and angelic, I want to comment on one reviewer's comparing her with Enya.  Indeed, this is a valid comparison.  And yet the two are each very distinctive.  You do hear the similarity on this album and on &quot;La Luna&quot;.  <br />I feel that Ms. Brightman expresses a quality of love for each of the songs she sings.  This is evident even in this case where there is such diversity of material.  Each of us has favorite cuts.  Mine are:  Puccini's &quot;Nessum Dorma&quot;, Kansas' &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;, &quot;So Many Things&quot;, &quot;Eden&quot; Morricone's &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Only an Ocean Away&quot; and the fittingly placed &quot;The Last Words You Said.&quot;  Also quite notable are &quot;Deliver Me&quot;, the song that first attracted me to Sarah Brightman when I heard it on a &quot;Pure Moods&quot; album,  and also the Titanic theme with Italian lyrics.  Some object to her singing songs with non-English lyrics, although for me this is part of the charm of her CD's.  One becomes more involved with the beauty of the song when not distracted by the lyrics.  Well, this one does anyway.<br />I gave the few one and two star reviews a close look for a clue to exactly who might not like this album as I do.  There are purists who believe they know better than the singer as to how the song should be sung, and those would not enjoy this album.  Those with less eclectic tastes and those annoyed by songs where you might not understand the foreign words would undoubtedly be annoyed by this CD.  I did note that one negative review wasn't about this CD at all, but of a concert...Others listened only once to this CD and decided they didn'tlike it, a common mistake.  I'd be missing many of my now favorite CD's had I never listened to them several times.  I do hope that the one reviewer who said he was throwing his copy into the trash was joking.  There are too many people who would gain much pleasure from this CD for some thoughtless person to throw it out.  But to each his own.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I've waited so long to see this movie. With only one theater in my town, it only lasted a week and i wasn't able to see it then. Usualy I wouldn't buy a movie before seeing it, but i went out on a limb with this one, and was amazed, astonished, blown away by this movie! It was absolutly the greatest movie i have ever seen. Its chaos, color, and music is like a feast for the senses. Ewan's voice was so innocent and naive, without losing his masculinity. Nicole, an amazing actress, was at her best in this film. You may love it, or you may hate it, but I guarantee you will not leave the theater (so to speak) without feeling a thing.
0743201140|4.0|This is a book that is quite simple, analysis of what you are and go from there. What you have as ability now, carries into your most advanced skills, then what you want to do with all. The problem with the book is that it is not strong on problem solving, this book is an identification tool and you use your insight to move. The test also leaves room for advancing. With that the book title is correct, Discover YOU, now you help yourself. <BR>For that I highly recommend a good book that is an all around help, SB 1 by Karl Mark Maddox
B00000IO4J|2.0|This movie doesn't really deserve to be seen.  It trades on the popular interest in aliens of any kind, combined with the always-ready backdrop of a high school environment, with the underdog yet genius school kids pulling the trump card against their teachers.  The storyline is very weak, with little external development, which lends to the movie an 'empty' air that is not filled by any amount of attempted drama in the lighting or soundtrack.<br />Watching 'The Faculty' is a strange experience, neither remotely frightening nor absorbing, the cast flit through their roles rapidly and do not entice the viewer into the action.  As a take-off of 'The Terminator' or 'Alien' it is faulted and unconvincing, and fails dreadfully in any way to hold water as a serious movie of any kind.  The only people who could justifiably watch this would be sold-out aficionados of Elijah Wood, of which I am sure there are many.  His performance, such as it can be given the material he has to work with, is excellent, as is that of the rest of the younger cast (particularly DuVall and Hartnett), but if Mr Wood or Mr Hartnett don't up your heart-o-meter whenever you see them on screen, then don't give this movie any of your valuable time.
B000002J09|2.0|I do indeed happen to think that Led Zeppelin IV is way overrated. True, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is an alright tune but hey, it doesn't come near to the great tunes (and rythms!) of say Moody Blues \\"Every good boy deserves favour\\". What about the rocking side? Well, Led Zeppelin is competent in that area but you have to turn to LZ II which easily gets 5 stars. Every track on LZ II (except Moby Dick) is way above anything on LZ IV.<br />They never delivered another album like LZ II again (but possibly there are some great live recordings out there which I don't know).
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is an extremely funny movie. Forget Chicken Run. This is AWESOME! A note to parents: This movie has more than it's share of &quot;bathroom humor&quot;. Other than that it is a hilarious movie with a wonderful cast-A really strange ogre, a nonstop-talking donkey. A princess under a spell. An evil short person. How much better can you get?
B00005U18E|4.0|Charming, witty, cute...being a fan of 1) British comedy and 2) COLIN FIRTH, baby, how could this go wrong?  Well, it didn't completely...  First two thirds of the movie just great.  Last third--what??  Did they READ the book?  I sympathize with the other customer reviewer who noted the lack of serious out-loud snorting guffaws one experienced when reading the book.  Mark's character was left sadly shallow, whereas in the book he is allowed all kinds of depth and heroics.  But maybe I'm biased, as I wanted to see as much of Colin Firth as possible.  Anyway.  Still entertaining.  Hugh Grant perfect Daniel.  Renee alright--score one for the American chick no one thought could do it--but I wonder why, in the land of the Bard and theatrical traditions, they had to cross the pond for Bridget?  Ah, well, marketability.<BR>So, if there was a 3.5 star rating, I would probably give that, but I'll round up for necessity's sake.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna's album, \\"Music\\" is a sort of tribute to the craft that made her the biggest selling artist of the world. Music is her specialty, starting in 1982 with her self-penned \\"Everybody.\\"  The latest album brings back memories on why we love Madonna: the music that she makes!<br /><br />Her album contains twelve tracks (Australian edition) and starts with the title track.  It was like listening to Holiday in 1983, Into the Groove in 1985, Vogue in 1990 and Fever in 1993.  Madonna is inviting everybody to celebrate life with music, the universal language!<br /><br />Other tracks are just as great as her previous album, Ray of Light. Impressive Instant instantly impresses you (especially the remix version), with similarly-grooved Runaway Lover, Amazing (a Beautiful Stranger sequel), American Pie and Dont Tell Me.  Ballads also haunt you: Paradise (Not for Me), I Deserve It, What It Feels Like for a Girl, and the best of the bunch is Gone.<br /><br />No doubt, comparisons to her 80's work is inevitable, but Madonna is an artist who continues to grow in all aspects because she loves her craft and her determination (after two decades) is as strong as ever.  Yes, Holiday may have started it all, Like a Virgin is a classic, Papa Dont Preach is vintage, Like a Prayer is simply glorious, Erotica is an outrageous attempt, Take a Bow is simply incredible, Evita means she really can do it, and Frozen may be one of her greatest songs ever, but Madonna chose to move on than rest on her laurels.  She is not afraid, she is artistic, and she is innovative.<br /><br />Proof: the Music album!<br /><br />Madonna will never have a comeback album, because she NEVER left us even for a single year during the last two decades! She has always been with us.  Unsure?  Count all your Madonna albums!<br /><br />Long live the Queen!
B000050XEI|3.0|A Day Without Rain is an album that tries to recapture the beauty, majesty, and grandeur of previous Enya releases, succeeding and fumbling, sometimes even in the same song.  As a devoted fan of Enya's, I purchased this album the first week it was released in America, and was surprised, delighted, and shocked.  It's a different release for Enya, very light in tone, not nearly as touching or contemplative with many of the vocals slipping into the background of the all too prevalent lush strings, and consequently Enya's message isn't as fluid or pronounced in this album.<br />A Day Without Rain opens the album, and is a fantastic instrumental composition.  And why wouldn't it, considering it was based on Watermark, Enya's amazing, calming instrumental from her fourteen year old album, Watermark.  The vocals and instrumentation are simply inverted, poetically almost, considering Watermark was an album centered on water, and A Day Without Rain is like a day without this water.  Wild Child, is a dynamic \\"pop\\"esque piece, with lush strings, great voicings courtesy of Enya, and a roaring melody that is slightly flawed by the incessant repetitions of \\"What a way / to make it through / what a day.\\"  \\"Only Time,\\" the real hit of A Day Without Rain, that went #1 in Germany and Canada and # 10 here in America, is a contemplative piece, emotional and feeling, that seems almost too short.  It's still an amazing piece, with the varied instrumentation and peaceful, ruminative lyrics.<br />Tempus Vernum is where Enya starts to falter.  I've never found an Enya track I didn't enjoy until Tempus Vernum.  It is a horrid track that doesn't deserve to be included on A Day Without Rain.  The Latin is superb (although the pronunciation of the word \\"ergo\\" is a bit questionable) however Enya's focus is nonexistent on this piece.  Tempus Vernum (\\"Spring Time\\") has the feeling of an old gothic manor to it not spring, and even Enya's said she was trying to convey a feeling of all four seasons,not just summer.  Deora ar mo Chroí is a song, like many on A Day Without Rain, that needs more lyrics.  The message is there, but the deep thought that Enya is known for, simply isn't.  She seems almost weepy on the piece, effective at some times, and annoying at others.  To compound matters, this is the only Gaelic song on A Day Without Rain.  Where are the long, sensuous songs like Smaointe... that really showcased Enya's forte of Gaelic?  Flora's Secret, attempts to rekindle the beauty of the first three tracks and does so quite nicely, with lush pizzicato strings.  And, as we've come to expect from Enya, she takes plenty of liberty on the lyrics.  Fallen Embers, is a real disappointment.  Touted as Enya's favorite song on ADWR, the feeling is there on the piece, with heartbreaking vocals and lyrics, but the message could be more protracted in delivery.  Just as you feel what Enya is conveying, the song is over, much like many on ADWR.  Sad really, considering this song has so much potential.  The one minute, thirty-seven second Silver Inches, seems almost cheap.  It's simply the same composition, repeated twice, with the inclusion of a second instrument on the second repetition.  It lacks the power and strength that other Enya instrumentals seem to possess inherently, because Enya is a fantastic composer, as well as singer.  Pilgrim finds Enya where she excels.  Songs about nature, direction, hope, life, and journeys is what she's does best, and Pilgrim is no exception.  It's a very powerful piece that ranks up there with Only Time and Wild Child.  One by One, is another fantastic piece, that finds Enya, testing the waters of something new, while combining the elements of past musical forays.  It's an Enya favorite of mine, because of the amazing multi-layered vocals and stunning inclusion of Spanish lyrics.  Lazy Days, has Enya in the Wild Child mode again, and it's a mainly effective move, with very prominent string instrumentation and a roaring melody, that's able to put a smile on your face.  Then, sadly, ADWR concludes on an almost confusing note.  You ask yourself, \\"What was Enya trying to convey, by traversing so many musical styles and themes?\\"  The fact is, I don't think even Enya really knows.  On this terse album (that lasts a meager, to say the least, 34 minutes) it seems that Enya's trying to find herself.  The assuredness of The Memory of Trees is not felt on ADWR.  The soaring, unencumbered passion that was Watermark, is not expressed in ADWR.  The grandness and majesty that was so keenly the aural delight of Shepherd Moons, is attempted to be recaptured through such songs as Flora's Secret and One by One, but is never really accomplished quite as well.  <br />As a fan of Enya's music, I'm very happy that Enya, through ADWR, has finally achieved the commercial success and recognition she deserves, but also find it ironic, considering it is her weakest album.  All-in-all, ADWR will capture you on some songs, sink into the background on others, and not really leave the impact other Enya releases have, by the end of its 34 minutes.
B0000025GW|3.0|This sure is a strange album - musically it is full of quotations, some might say plagiarisms. 'I Believe in You' cribs from 'Smoke gets in Your Eyes'. 'When He Returns' chops lumps off 'Bridge over Troubled Water'. Many other pop classics are cheerfully robbed at various points. The lyrics are a strange mish-mash of ambiguous religiosity, romantic love, and conspiracy-theory politics. <br />Many of the four star reviews the album has received clearly derive from a desire to approve Dylan's abandonment of the Counter-Culture for Bible Christianity, rather from a genuine belief that this is a bunch of great songs. Well, folks, I think that's a simplistic reading of what we have here, and anyway, its not the way to judge music. I think this album derives from creative desperation, and from a deep desire to conjoin the cultural experiences of Dylan and his new black Christian lover. It's them together against the unbelieving world. Many of the songs blur devotion to God with devotion to her. <br />His anger at the failures and fallacies of counter-cultural politics is genuine, but chaotic. He's looking for an alternative position from which to prophesy - as he always had done, with the arrogance and anger that makes his work so distinctive. But now he's having to rely on a ready-made set of formulas, both musically and ideologically. He has found a way to renew his energy and his faith (in his work, rather more than in God, I think), but it's an ersatz energy, an injection of someone else's life-blood. It was never going to last. <br /> Having said that, no-one should underestimate the continuing power of the imagination at work here. Dylan always surprises, and he revitalise his musical models, turning them into something new. 'I Believe in You' is a powerful song. The serio-comic 'Animals' calypso is typical of the scherzo-like ditties Dylan often places before a final epic number, which does pack a punch when it comes. Still, I can't help feel that 'Bridge over Troubled Water' is ten times the song that 'When He Returns' is. Maybe Dylan thought his musical thefts were justified in a Greater Cause than the mere secular romance celebrated by Simon and Garfunkel and Jerome Kern. Well, maybe the Cause is greater. But I'm afraid that can't change the fact that it's the quality of the songs that counts here.
0553212737|4.0|&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people.  Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking.  Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma.  The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband.  Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel.  Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters.  By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting.  For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times.  Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions.  Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes.  In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her.  Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot.  For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together.  Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters.  Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet.  However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma.  Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage.  Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups.  However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with.  Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes.

B00004XONN|5.0|I bought Kid A about two months ago.  At that time, I would have given it two stars.  Two weeks later, it earned another.  Two weeks later, one more.  And now, two months after purchasing the album, I don't see how I could have ever given it anything below five stars.<br />This album is extremely cohesive.  Each track is meticulously placed.  Each song flows (or at least blends) into the next.  Nothing is out of place; not a song, not a note, not a thing.<br />Like with most Radiohead albums, the lyrics are quite interesting.  \\"Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon\\" and \\"We've got heads on sticks/And you've got ventriloquists\\" are my favorites.  Taken as a whole, this album probably has only 1/4 of the words of \\"OK Computer,\\" but they are used effectively.<br />The amount of words is not all that's changed.  Gone are the beautifully melodic guitars.  Included are the beautifully melodic keyboards.  Gone is the standard sound of a five-piece rock band.  Included is a quasi-electronic sound that is totally new to me (I can't say whether or not Radiohead invented it).<br />Although a common atmosphere pervades every track, the music on \\"Kid A\\" is substanially varied.  \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" is heavy on the keyboards.  \\"The National Anthem\\" is heavy on the bass.  \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" is defined by a mixture of vocals, acoustic guitars, and strings.  \\"Idioteque\\" and \\"Morning Bell\\" are dominated by a sporadic and pulsating beat.  The lovely \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" by harps and an organ.<br />Quite a number of reviewers make \\"Kid A\\" out to be an album without any \\"real music.\\"  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  Each song has a melody, it is merely presented in a way that is different from what most listeners are accustomed to.  Sometimes, the melodies are hidden in strong beats.  Sometimes, they are the beats themselves.  Sometimes, they are hidden in electronic noises.  Whatever the case, the melodies are there.<br />This album adds a nice dimension to any rock collection.  I know that five star ratings are thrown about quite frivolously on Amazon.com, but \\"Kid A\\" truly deserves it.  This album is a treat.  Despite this album's brilliance, unless you are a techno-freak, you shouldn't make \\"Kid A\\" your first Radiohead selection.

0066620996|5.0|After reading and rereading the review posted December 26 (two lousy starts), I can confidently conclude that who ever wrote that review did not actually read Good to Great.  I don't want to waste other readers time countering all of the arguments made in that post, but if someone really read the book (especially the first chapter) you would know that Jim Collins research is sound and all the arguments posted on December 26 are easily &quot;put to bed&quot;.  <br />I love that this book was a book of facts, research, and real data.  It is not a book of &quot;management theory&quot;, &quot;growth strategies&quot; and the like - it's research.  Until the final chapter (when Jim Collins tried to tie this into his previous book Built to Last), I felt the content was 99% bias free.  <br />Disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action. These are not novelties, if you were to read Covey, Orman, or a million other authors you could extrapolate the same principles - but for some reason this book was the bat that drove me home!  It will not only change the way I work, but it will change the way I live.  Truly.  This book has given me the tools to build a context in which to make consistently smart decisions.  Thanks to Jim and his research team.<br />P.S.  I would have loved to have heard more about the use of &quot;catalytic mechanisms&quot; in these companies.  I know there may be a solid reason for leaving them out, but after reading the HBR article, my curiousity is peaked.

B000007OY0|5.0|Everyone should see this.  It is as near to perfect as a movie can get.  Some of the many classic lines are:  &quot;Get busy living, or get busy dying,&quot;  &quot;Some birds are not meant to be caged.  Their feathers are just too bright...maybe I just miss my friend.&quot; There are also some very funny lines:  After Andy plays the opera record over the PA system, and is put in solitary for a time - he gets out of solitary and is sitting having lunch with his friends.  One of them asks &quot;Andy, couldn't you play something good, like Hank Williams?&quot; and Andy replies &quot;They broke down the door before I could take requests.&quot;<br />One of my favorite things about this wonderful film - It is the story of deep friendship between two men of different races, yet this difference is never once mentioned or referred to in any way.  That is as it should be.

I've loved classical music for years and being a young music listener, this has all the best Mozart. Tom Hulce is wonderful portraying Mozart. No one else could have done better. I must say Jeffrey Jones, who played Emperor Joseph, sounds like one of those very important businessmen. This is astounding. I feel sorry for you people who say the DVD was bad. You'll feel a lot better watching the VHS. &quot;Amadeus&quot; looks and sounds great on videotape.

0345448898|5.0|This beautifully written trilogy is a fantastic telling of how a young girl and boy come of age in a realm full of mystery, magic and danger.<br />Pullman intelligently borrows from history and quantum physics to portray a universe which is inherently conscious, intelligent and benevolent. At the same time, he exposes organized religion as a repressive force which distorts the true nature of God and places limits on human spiritual development. In so doing, he introduces us to the folly of core Judeo/Christian religious beliefs that include the notion that man is basically evil and in need of salvation.<br />Pullman returns the kingdom of God to it's rightful heirs -- the children -- who are born innocent, corrupted only by the distorted beliefs of self-righteous adults.<br />For me, this was not only a beautifully written, fantastic tale full of interesting plot twists and courageous protagonists, it was an excellent introduction to destructive religious thinking. For those of us who's desire it is to raise children who trust their own divine nature and believe in their own innate goodness, His Dark Materials is a wonderful expose of organized religion's most corrupt and virulent beliefs. By far better than two weeks of summer bible school!
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie has the UK in the palm of his hand in terms of popularity and sales, and yet he has only a cult following in the USA.  Why?  Is it because that he, unlike 90% of American top 40 artists, makes INTERESTING music?  Probably.  In any case, this album is a great collection of covers of oldies: standouts include &quot;Mack the Knife,&quot; &quot;They Can't Take That Away From Me,&quot; and &quot;Something Stupid&quot; with Nicole Kidman.  My mum and I were listening to this together, and we both enjoyed it tremendously.  I think she liked it mainly because it reminded her so much of her golden days.  If you haven't heard of Robbie Williams, then this is NOT the first CD you want to buy; instead, pick up &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; or &quot;Sing When You're Winning.&quot;  Those discs will give you an idea of what Robbie is really like musically.  Otherwise, established fans and admirers shouldn't hesitate to get this.
B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather I and II are perhaps two of the greatest movies ever made, a fact which is clear from watching them.  Godfather III, however, is a movie that, while not quite being horrible, is far from good. Pacino's performance is excellent in I and is perhaps the best part of II but, in III, there is very little interesting plot for him to work with so his performance falters.  The best performance of the trilogy, however, comes from Marlon Brando, who makes Vito Correleone one of the greatest characters in movie history.  On the whole, these three movies are exellent.<br />Overall, the sound and video quality is excellent, although there were a few scenes where you could see the wear and tear on the video and where the sound degraded.  Other than that the DVD series was excellent and I would highly reccomend purchasing it.
B00005M989|1.0|Call this one &quot;Prince: The Hits (The Cliffs Notes Version).&quot; And it's a lousy version at that: how can you do ANY collection of Prince and completely ignore the &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; album?  No &quot;Controversy?&quot;  Listen up: if you want to get a REAL Prince greatest-hits set, then save up your money and get the 3-disc &quot;The Hits/The B-Sides&quot; which is way better.  Prince is way too prolific an artist to have his entire career crammed onto one disc.  Everybody involved in the making of this CD should be ashamed of themselves.
B000003JBM|5.0|Guru is the god of hiphop and this idea of fusing rap with jazz is actually really cool. he pulls it off well and the whole album is like no other rap album you ever heard. His flows are cool and calm but still hardcore. This album is really meaningful and Guru really beleives in what he says. He even collaborates with French pro MC Solaar on ;'Le Bien, Le Mal'. If you want good music or if you like rap or jazz this will be a truly unique experience. Get this now- and Im not just saying that!!
B0000060NF|5.0|For an album that's only 30+ minutes in length, Marvin Gaye made every one of those minutes count in a way that very few artists could ever hope to pull off. From start to finish, it's quite obvious to me that Marvin was on a mission like none other before or after him since. What's Going On is rather like the ultimate suite on inner-city life, with every song telling a simple yet powerfully moving story that winds up being connected to the general urban theme of the album. I could say more about this album, but it seems to me that one only has to listen to it in its entirety to understand why it continues to be a landmark in American pop music. This should be essential listening for EVERYONE! 'Nuff said.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather DVD Collection is a beautifully produced, carefully remastered and nicely priced set of some of the most amazing movies of all time, The Godfather I, II and III.<br />The special features DVD is a great addition to the set although most or all of the additional scenes in it are already there in The Godfather Trilogy.<br />I would recommend this set to any die hard GODFATHER fan.
0060934913|2.0|For those who thought that the Normal Mailer types were on the wane, here's one who appears to have been crossed with Joan Rivers. Imagine a mix of catty commentary on all kinds of inane marginalia mixed with egotistical swagger and you'll be able to almost smell the sweat of your cell mate if you choose to read this thing.<br />But if you are a cook wannabe who needs discipline, delivered by a drug-vetted Dimmesdale, the author will tell you which knife will make you cool and which one will make you a [dork], while he's reminding you that you're never going to be as good as him. This cat's follow up should have a picture on the front with him swinging from the chandelier of his haute cuisine big top from his prehensile tail. Julia Child would spin in her grave if she weren't still alive (proof that she probably hasn't read this yet).
B00005LOUP|1.0|This is a mishmash of a movie, full of Jim Carrey making his usual faces, but with an implausible addition to the classical Grinch plotline, in order to make it \\"interesting\\" to adults.<br /><br />Save your money for the classic Grinch.  This one just doesn't work. Bah, humbug!
B00005R87Q|5.0|This happens to be the first dvd that made my wife exclaim loudy, &quot;Wow, that sounds great!!!&quot;  Considering she never understood why i spent so much money on my surround sound system untill this dvd says a lot.<br />Plot wise it's weak but who cares!!!  Visually it's not much different than most dvd's but the action is almost non-stop.<br />If you have a DTS decoder i would recommend this dvd as THE benchmark dvd for showcasing your DTS system.
B000002ULO|4.0|Aside from &quot;Really Love You,&quot; a pointless and drawn-out Texas-blues number that manages to waste the talents of both McCartney and Steve Miller, there are no bad songs on the album.  McCartney saves the album's highlights for the end: &quot;Beautiful Night,&quot; whose grandeur and tasteful arrangement makes it sound as if it could have appeared on Abbey Road, and the quirky and captivating &quot;Great Day,&quot; which would have been at home on the White Album.  (&quot;Great Day&quot; was written circa 1967.)  I also am fond of Paul's piano-boogie &quot;Flaming Pie,&quot; which reminds me a bit of his earlier songs &quot;1985&quot; and &quot;Lady Madonna.&quot;  Although the album may not have enough classic songs to make it a 5-star record, it is quite good and demonstrates that Paul continues to write some of the finest songs in pop.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I am a huge horror fan and have been waiting for a movie that will scare me and make me jump...and this was it!! I'd seen trailers of the movie and I knew that evil man would scare me. I've never spent 30 minutes of any film jumping out of my skin every 5 seconds, it was great!! The use of shock tactics was excellent and the man who preys on these 2 teens is terrifying...up until one point. The illusion of a scary old guy was shattered when he suddenly has wings and a scaly body. I think this killed the terror. The use of effects made the guy less scary. But all things considered this movie was non stop thrills from beginning to end. Finally a horror movie with a different formula, unlike the conventional killer stalks teens + kills teens + dies at the end formula. Well worth a peep!!!
B00005OAA6|5.0|I have to give Posh 5 stars!  I ordered this CD when it first came out from amazon UK several months ago along with her autobiography \\"learning to fly\\".  I'm a devoted Posh Spice fan so i love this CD but really all pop is the same.  Pop is never good or quality music.... it's just about fun.  And this album is definitely fun though i would have liked to see less of the slow ballads.  the best songs are the upbeat ones:  'not such an innocent girl' and 'girlfriend' etc etc<br />Get the autobiography and check out her website victoriabeckham.mu<BR>best wishes and continued success and happiness to victoria, david and brooklyn!
B000056N8X|4.0|I found Highlander Endgame to be a very good movie. Unlike the other three movies, this one included both heroes, Duncan and Connor. When I saw coming attractions for this film and saw Duncan and Connor's faces in them, i knew it would be good... .<BR>Before I tell you the basic plot of the story, I want to remark on how I found a few scenes, seen in coming attractions, that looked good, that i didn't see in the actual movie. A little disappointing to me.<BR>In Highlander Endgame, we find out that Duncan and Connor MacLeod aren't as perfect and noble immortals as we thought, from their past. With Connor MacLeod's story, we find out that Connor MacLeod killed a unarmed defenseless man 4 and a half centuries ago. Doesn't sound like the Connor MacLeod most Highlander fans and Duncan know. The man wasn't completely innocent, although. He had cast Connor's mother to be burned, killed. Connor was forced to watch and out of outrage killed the man responsible. Connor also killed his son, Jacob Kell, or did he. Kell, was going to attack Connor for revenge, this time leaving Connor almost no choice. But in the recent 20th Century, Rachel Ellenstein, Connor's adopted daughter, was in Connor's shop alone when it exploded.<BR>Duncan MacLeod, as well, did something in the past to create a breach between him and someone he loved. Sometime in the 1700's, Duncan married Kate Delaney, an immortal. She wasn't immortal yet, because she hadn't been killed, which would trigger her immortality. But since she didn't know, and Duncan and Connor did, you'll never guess what Duncan did to his wife on his wedding night, to keep her mad at him FOREVER.<BR>So in Present Day, Connor MacLeod finds out that his long lost enemy, Kell, is alive, immortal, and seeking revenge, along with the assistance with Kate, who seeks revenge on Duncan. After four hundred years, Jacob Kell is a very powerful immortal, too powerful for either Highlander to beat alone. If one must face the sinister evil enemy, theother will have to sacrifice his life. For in the end, \\"There Can be Only One\\". Find out which one in the story about revenge, redemption, choices, and immortality ... Highlander Endgame is a great movie. Take my advice, and watch it.
B000001F5F|5.0|I have always been the kind of person who likes studio recordings much more than live ones. This album has probably had more to do with changing my mind about that than any other. Like no other band I can think of, U2 is incredible live. I had never heard the studio versions of &quot;Party Girl&quot; or &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; until they released the greatest hits package. Obviously the versions on this record and Rattle and Hum blow the studio cuts out of the water. &quot;Gloria&quot; &quot;11 O'clock tick tock&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot; are rendered so much better on this record than on the studio albums it is unbelievable. Great live band. This captures the heart and passion of early U2. Must have for anyone wanting to hear them in their heyday.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was a good book, I really like it. Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed.

B00005TT77|5.0|Normally, tribute albums come up pathetically short of the original.  This album is the exception.  All the artists involved stay true to each song by keeping the same spirit of the Beatles while sprinkling in their own influence.  Best song on the Album could very well be Ben Harper's version of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.  The Crowes' &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and Eddie Vedder's &quot;You've got ot hide your love away&quot; are right up there as well.
6305268843|5.0|Well thought out story.  The settings, actors, actress, clothes,<BR>simply wonderful.  It's warm and lustfull, with antisapation. I couldn't ask for a anything else from it.
0451198492|4.0|Being \\"2001- A Space Odissey\\" one of my favourite films, I was really excited about reading the novel based on its screenplay. Now, after finishing my reading, I love film much more, but I didn't like the novel very much.<br />In my opinion, Arthur C. Clarke's work has  much more details and gives away many subtle nuances of the film. Everthing that kept me thinking about for days when I first saw the picture was easily `solved' in the novel. I mean, he explains -- or at least tries to -- everthing we saw in the picture. Opposite to the film also, there are many, many dialogues, and  some solutions  that shouldn't be given to the reader, once he/she could come up with his/her own interpretation. In the novel things are very clear and not so much dubious. It seems to me that many things Kubrick tried to hide in order to make us think about, Clarke just give them facts and figures. It took way all the magic that the movie had created in my mind. If I haven't had watched \\"2001...\\" once, I would think this novel was terrific. But, as I said, I have watched this movies dozen times.<br />Moreover, Clark's way of writing is a bit boring and sometimes it seemed to me that he was treating me like child -- as when we explaing abstract concepts to little children. Bowman is a bit shallow as a character, he seems not to have many inner conflicts, what really makes charaters interesting and worthy to carry for. I thought really boring  a chapter where the auhor writes about the different theories about E.T.s, and I didn't think it read at least intesting. In some parts of the novel, the writer makes us feel that scentists and astronuasts are a kind of blessed human beings, much better than us, ordinary people. [But maybe it is just me!!]<br />Anyway, it can be an interesting reading mainly if you compare what they expected the world to be in the year 2001 and -- now that this year is over, we already are in 2002-- how the world, people and science were. The are much more errors than guesses when it comes to Clarke's `predictions'. For instance, the greatest one is we haven't been living, colonizing or exploring planets in the way they mention in 2001. Space Travels are not as easy and common as in the novel. I also think the writer reads a bit naive when talking about living in other planets. According to his writings, there seemed to be no war or fights between nations for discorvered lands. I think when mankind will be able to live and colonize another planets there will be wars -- just like in past centuries when Africa was being colonized. He also mention URSS, but it's been many years that this union has been dissolved. Of course, when this novel was written the world was living beyond the shadow of the Cold War, and the writer hadn't imagined that I might have ended in the 90's as well as the end of URSS. On the other hand, he is right about people being able to exchange information via computers. [Although computers are not as smart as HAL 9000] Many times in the novel, the astronauts read newspaper in a computer screen -- ie the Internet, albeit it was not possible to Clarke predict that this would be the net's name.<br />The part I like most in the novel is the first one; the one about the pre human beings. It made many points clearer because I could read what was going on inside their minds-- something we can not be sure in the movie. I also appreciated the ending. Not only does the author explain about the star child -- a bit frustrating --, but he also goes a bit further with a little pessimistic event -- very creepy!<br />All in all, it is not a bad novel, but I think it misses a lot when compared to the movie. I'm not a sci-fi geek, but I could understand most of the language used in the story, so this will not be a problem for those who intend to read it and don't understand scientific language. Anyway, I gave it four stars, because I like the story very much.than guesses when it comes to Clarke's `predictions'.

B00005RDAE|5.0|This video starts off with her last video from her &quot;Oops I did it again&quot; album which is called &quot;Don't let me the last to know&quot; then &quot;I'm a slave 4 you&quot; from the 2001 Vmas and then it shows the Britney's Pepsi commerical you can hear the whole song but it's not the whole video because they have the guys staring at her and things like you see on the Tv commerical but a little added votage of the guys in there.Then she strikes a pose from Vouge mag while they are playing a new song from her album &quot;Anticipating&quot;. Next they show &quot;I'm a slave 4 you&quot; Music video the they go into &quot;I'm not a girl not' yet a woman&quot; music video and thats one of the 3 versions that they have the video on here is just her and no movie scenes from her new movie &quot;Crossroads&quot;.  Plus it has her singing &quot;Overprotected&quot; that has some really funny outtakes from the movie it's the same thing you can see on her new cd &quot;Britney&quot; but you can't hear it on the cd. The commerical from HBO is just her singing a lttle part of &quot;I'm a slave for you&quot; and shes just dancing in an elvis suite. The last thing on here is The making of &quot;croosroads&quot; which has a lot of unseen footage from her new movie and shes talking about the movie and telling you what its about. This video is only 30 minutes. This is a really good video if you like to see music videos and you want to get to know her even better.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This record will probably be another instance in which super-cool critics dog it, but the regular folk (a.k.a. record buyers) will really like it.  Catchy pop tunes with great hooks, and really nice (yet subtle) guitar work from a really talented guy.  I bought this CD based after reading a magazine article, and now at least a dozen friends are hooked on it.  So if your a super-slick critic, you may want to pass and stick with Radiohead, but if you just want a solid record with good tunes, pick this up.
B00005TT77|5.0|As a person who generally abhors albums that are tribute in nature, this one actually captures the Beatles' spirit.  Only having 3 weeks to record, mix and release, this soundtrack is indeed faithful to the original songs from different parts of the Beatle catalog.  Especially poignant and great are Eddie Vedder's take on &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and the Black Crowes' (even more psychedelic than the original) &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot;.  Vedder can't help but release the pain in his voice as does John Lennon in the same song.  By keeping faithful to the original, Vedder does the song great justice and I knew that when he signed on (especially after refusing the Doors' tribute album fiasco of a year ago), that this was going to be a special album and I cannot wait to see the movie.  Also noteworth are the versions of &quot;Two of Us&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, and &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;.  Overall as strong album of great artists faithfully paying homage to one of the greatest bands ever.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Critics have come to label Requiem a MTV movie that is only targeted to youth.  Other critics have dubbed Aronofsky's use of fast-paced music montages as being another association to MTV's usage of similar visualizations in commercials, videos, as well as in programming.  This has led to even more criticism of the film as being just another youth-appealing drug flick.  This association is incorrect and derogatory to the true nature of the film.  It is unfortunate that this film has been classified in the youth drug genre with films such as Up In Smoke, Half Baked, or Go, which are truly what the genre sets out to be.  Requiem was set out to be as timeless as possible, and to appeal to all generations.  MTV is style over substance, while this film is substance through style.  Drug culture is a part of all generations no matter how it is expressed or repressed. Aronofsky's technical creativity can be see through the use of atypical camera techniques such as split-screens, time lapses, fish eyes lenses, surrealistic dream sequences, multiple exposures, and digital effects.  The uses of theses techniques are both cinematic eye candy and flaunting.  Requiem For A Dream is a perfect example of how character development can be achieved throught the most intimate subjectivity.<br />Don't rent it, just buy it.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is without doubt the best Mariah Carey album, with all of her best and most popular material on it.  It contains just the right amount of R&amp;B influence, with Jermaine Dupri helping to write some of the numbers, whilst still retaining her pop roots.  What's perhaps most interesting though, is the fact that this album is not only quite intelligent but also deeply personal.  Indeed, it's rare that a diva ever writes her own material, but Mariah does.<br />There are very few of the obvious love songs here, with the majority seeming to concern Mariah's split from her husband.  Songs such as 'I Am Free' are particularly explicit in this fact, with more subtle references to it in 'Long Ago', for example.  In these songs Mariah understands that she's lost that sense of innocence, that the giddy sense of love expressed in the excellent 'Fantasy' are just that - a fantasy.  In many ways, 'Daydream' has a sombre tone.  Particularly on the duet with Boyz II Men, 'One Sweet Day', this has a real sense of loss to it, whether it's a person or a sense of innocence.<br />What's also refreshing is the fact that there's no filler here, with each song being great in its own right.  Although it's easy to pick out the best tracks, it's much harder to pick a track that you don't like.  More obviously, Mariah has such a fantastic voice that it's hard not to be blown away on several of her songs.  What's nice though is that her vocals are often restrained on the slower songs to a more effective subdued tone.  This is surely one of the best pop albums of the last decade.
0790734060|5.0|For 5 years this video sat on my mother's video shelf, while I watched every movie around it and excluded this one it gathered dust. Finally one day when I was 14 I grabbed it off the shelf in order to save myself from boredom. I unwrapped the cellephane (it had never been opened before) and popped it into the vcr and sat down waiting to be dissapointed. I remember looking at the cover and thinking it was some comic book movie. After 30 minutes of the movie I couldn't stop watching for anything. I was mesmorized by the beauty of the music and amazed at Salieri's hatred for Mozart. I'll never forget the scene where he burns his crucifix. That scene is probably one of the most memorable for me because while he's burning it I could feel his pain. All he wanted was to be heard and respected. He wanted to fill the world with the most beautiful music but to his horror that is not God's plan for him.<BR>I have watched this movie at least 40 times and have memorized entire scenes and say them along with the movie. This is by far my favorite movie ever. Followed by Erin Brockovich and Ever After.<BR>If you have only heard of the songs written by Mozart that Salieri plays on the piano in the asylum then you need to not only watch this movie but go to a music store and pick up a couple cds. I can not however pick a favorite tune as Danielle says in Ever After &quot;I could no sooner pick a favorite star in the heavens.&quot; Amadeus is a haunting dramatic true telling of two lives that were both changed forever by fate. Tom Hulce is surprisingly good in the role as 'Wolfie'. Forget whatever you saw before in movies like Parenthood. He is an incredible actor and I recommend this movie to everyone. It's amazing, plain and simple.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD.  I WAS SENT A BURNED COPY AND NOT THE ORIGINAL.  I FEEL THAT THE SELLER DEFINATELY MISREPRESENTED HIMSELF AND DID IT PURPOSELY.
B000002BE9|5.0|I had been listening to Apple's album since I was 13 then I was molested by a family member. I never truly understood her song 'Sullen Girl' before that night, although I was not raped I still have a deep connection with that song. My pearl may not have been taken but my innocence and trust was. I can remember having to retell my story to people at the police station, lawyers, jurors, then having to go to court with my story. The only thing that got me through that were artists like Fiona Apple (Tidal) and Jewel (Pieces Of You). Not only will I always feel stronger and less like a victim when I listen to the songs on their albums I feel less hatred and fear towards the man who killed parts of me.<BR>Fiona Apple is one of the most intelligent singers I have ever come in contact with. Her songs such as 'Sullen Girl', 'The First Taste', 'Never Is A Promise', and 'The Child Is Gone' are showcases for her talent. Not only is Apple's voice soft, beautiful, strong, and demanding but it is also haunting. She is one of the few artists who not only plays an instrument (the piano) on their album but also writes all of the songs. I go to sleep listening to this album and listen to it whenever I get depressed or angry. Her voice has a calming effect that not many artists have. Beautiful, intelligent Fiona deserves so many more stars than just 5.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Then this is definately a movie for you to get. I will admit I may be a bit biased because I am a fan of Vin Diesel, but the movie supports itself without the need for \\"Star power\\". I consider myself a bit of a Grease Monkey/Car Addict... So from the opening of the movie I was scootched as close to the edge of my seat as one can get, drooling over the Buffet of equipment (and Vehicular Art) that was paraded across the screen. Saliva aside...  I found myself drawn into the movie for more than the cars (But they were nice!) The movie takes you through the guy's version of Male bonding and acceptance... forget about the techno-babble it boils down to Trust & Love of cars. It is a testosterone building experience just to watch. Vin Diesel is Mr. Billy-Bad-... in this flick with moments of human emotion that catch you off guard... but acceptably. The cinematography switches styles a few times noticeably but it only stands to highlight the fact that the implication of Speed or Emotion (On a different level) is to be NOTICED right then. This movie will more than likely be one that I need to replace (Due to the constant wear it receives). If you like Cars, If you like Car movies, If you still have a pulse... You will LOVE this movie!

B000002VFW|5.0|This entry of Stansfield is plethora of color and rhythm.  This entire disk contains a unique blend of engaging beats which range from the listening one would do in a relaxed mode to that of upstart dance tracks.   <BR>To simplify this review, this c.d. is a gem.  It`s acoustic value is terrific.  What do I mean?  In this case, the acoustic value of a c.d. is when you can say some or all of the songs by an artist on a disk sound great at different volumes.  Don`t let the release date fool you; it is such a departure from other artists trying to combine the chill factor with dance.  I was still a kid when I started to listen to it, and yet I still return to it when I am in the mood for a fresh vibe to relax with, or just for everyday tasks.<BR>And besides, I am a canadian writing a review here, my first review in fact,(which is fairly rare on this site). I wouldn`t take the time unless it was something to recommend to other music buyers.  Even if you are not sure with it, buy it anyway.  I guarantee that if you don`t enjoy it, someone very close to you will as it is music that you can so easily chill with.
B00005ABIP|5.0|Cake is one of the most daring, funky, innovative bands today.  With the sound of the trumpet fused with jazz, rock, and country, and some funny, satiristical lyrics, Cake is one heck of a ride.  I have no idea why this is Parental Guidance because they never swear once on the entire CD.
B00004YKUY|4.0|Sure, there is no Steve Perry, but there is a major difference between Journey's latest &quot;Arrival&quot;, and they're previous efforts: All their past albums had one or two #1 hits, and the rest of each album were average or worse. With &quot;Arrival&quot; you won't even find a top 10 hit (blame that on alternative and boy bands), but the album is good all the way through! Every song, rock or ballad, is solid solid solid. It kind of reminds me of the Bad English &quot;Self-Titled&quot; album. With exception of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Arrival&quot; is the only Journey album I can listen to all the way through and say &quot;Awesome!&quot; Quit complaining about the singer change and listen to it! You won't be disappointed.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is my absolute favorite of Cake CD's and displays a more happy-go-lucky side of the satiristical band.  The trumpet, jazz, rock, and country fusion is a refreshing break from the formulaic music of today. Cake is wild and innovative in their sound and I never get tired of it.  If you get squirmish about swearing, you might want to pick up the edited version instead because Nugget has the &quot;f-word&quot; in it about 40-50 times, too many to count. Otherwise, Cake is an energetic, creative band which is the best of today's music.
B000059RL3|5.0|While I do dispute that this is Marvin's best album, it is impossible to argue with the fact that this is one of the most important and influential albums ever.  Soul music was about love and relationships, not about war and politics back when Marvin recorded this.  He revolutionalized soul music, and used his popularity to voice his opinion on the struggles of youth, drawing from the wartime experiences of his younger brother.  <BR>Much has been said about the power, innovation, and importance of the album.  If you do not already know about it, you can not listen to it without being incredibly impressed with the music, the voice, and the message.  So much was done differently on this album - such as songs with a political message, and the flow of one song to another.  So much, in fact, that Motown didn't even want to release it.  There isn't much about the album itself that hasn't been said already.  It is a classic.<BR>The deluxe version, not without faults, is definately worth buying.  <BR>I basically have one problem with the disc.  The alternate versions and single versions differ so slightly from the originally released album that you hardly notice.  It almost feels as though Motown was trying to fill space, by finding anything to warrant releasing a 2 disc set.  If you are a true fan, and want incredible alternate takes check out &quot;Let's Get It On - Deluxe Edition&quot;.  The different takes on Get It On are truely alternates, and you can hear obvious differences - unlike here.  <BR>What makes this disc worth buying though, is the concert.  It was a concert that Marvin had to be &quot;tricked&quot; into performing at.  He was a notoriously shy performer, and was infamous for backing out of concerts last minute.  A friend of Marvin's orchestrated &quot;Marvin Gaye Day&quot; in his hometown of Washington D.C. to get him to come out of hiding and actually perform.  And perform, he did!  From the very beginning, you can tell that it was a very special performance.  He eases into the show with a medly of his past hits, and then explodes into this new material - even redoing two songs to ensure that he gave the audience his best.  The man can not only sing beautifully in a studio, he can sing with the best of them live as well.  It is an amazing show, and makes the deluxe edition well worth the price.  <BR>Also worth a listen is the alternate version of Distant Lover, or Head Title as it is called on the disc.  It is truely different than the original (not as emotionally charged), but still great to hear some of the unreleased material surface after so many years.<BR>Every Marvin Gaye fan, and every music fan, should own this gem!
B00005R2IS|5.0|I won't go into details about the movie. Fans of Mad Max already know the plight of Max Rockatansky and how he became the Road Warrior. Instead, I will go into how this DVD is better than the original released in the United States.<br />First off, get this DVD. If all you have ever seen is the USA version with the awful dubbed American voices, then you have not seen the true Mad Max movie.<br />Let me say something about dubbing: it normally doesn't come off well, especially when you redub English with English, as is the case with Mad Max. You lose ALL the emotions that the actors had originally portrayed in the movie. With Mad Max, this is entirely true. In fact, the actors that did the dubbed voices completely carried their emotions over the edge to the point of campiness. In no WAY did they portray the real emotions of the characters and it ruined the movie. It actually made excellent actors look bad and made the entire movie campy, which it isn't. It has it's moments of humor that actually fill in nicely with the Aussie voices, but is pushed over the edge in campiness with the American dubbing. It really is that bad, especially now that I've seen it with the Aussie voices.<br />Once I saw this movie with the original Aussie voices, my opinion changed. I may be so bold as to say that this movie is possibly better than Mad Max 2 - The Road Warrior (and let's get that changed to Mad Max 2 now since everyone knows about Mad Max). What really upset me was that in the American version, they even ADDED dialogue that was SO unnecessary! I didn't realise this until I saw the Aussie version.<br />This is not only a great action movie, but a wonderful drama as well. It has so many elements from different genres: action, suspense, horror, drama. George Miller put together an excellent movie on such a low budget.<br />A lot of the elements were lost due to the dubbing but have now been brought back to life with this DVD release. One case is when Mel is talking to Jessie after Goose buys the farm. In the American dubbed version, Max doesn't seem that broken up about it. However, hearing Mel's voice, you can hear how Max is near tears, upset and sad that his best friend is dead. It really brings you closer to the characters to the point that you feel for them as real people. This was driven home to me even more during the scene when Jessie and Sprog are about to be mowed down by the Toecutter and his band of seedy thugs. When Jessie was running away, my mood turned to sadness, knowing what was about to happen. Once it happened, that sadness turned to extreme anger. When Max finally extracts his revenge, I was cheering. That NEVER happened with the American dubbed version.<br />The DVD has two excellent documentories: one on how the movie was made and the other about Mel Gibson's rise to fame. There are also trailers, TV spots and posters available as well as the original American dubbed (mono) track, a commentary track, and a trivia track that pops up cool trivia bits while you watch the movie.<br />At the price they have listed, this is a steal!...No true Mad Max fan would be without this movie. It was SO excellent that I watched it twice the day I bought it.<br />Get it or else, it's time to send the MFP after you!r Goose buys the farm.

B00005LB9O|5.0|I started listening to Travis because a friend of mine recommended them to me.  I heard Driftwood, off &quot;The Man Who&quot;, and was immediately hooked.  This is one of the most interesting bands around.  &quot;The Man Who&quot; is one of my favorite albums of all time, and still gets quite a bit of play from a man with 1,000 + cds.  I loved it so much, I checked out their first album, &quot;Good Feeling&quot;, and was confused.  &quot;Good Feeling&quot; was a decent album, but lacked the instrumentation and emotionally deep songwriting of &quot;The Man Who&quot;.  I was concerned over what kind of an album I would be hearing next from the boys across the pond.<BR>Well, much to my relief, they didn't change much from &quot;The Man Who&quot;.  They use their talents to the max.  The production, and the use of instruments is incredible - far surpassing that of their last album.  Amazingly, so is the songwriting.  <BR>This is one of those albums that you can not get enough of.  The album gives music fans everywhere reason to be hopeful.  Travis is one of those bands that may never catch on in the mainstream, due to the overplay of annoying cookie-cutter punk rock, rap rock, and teen pop stars.  Travis doesn't fit into the modern radio mold of airplay.  They are better than that.  <BR>The album is blessed with many, many great songs.  Sing has one of the catchiest hooks on the album, that you can't help but get into.  The songwriting is best displayed on songs like Side, The Humpty Dumpty Love Song, and Pipe Dreams (&quot;I'd pray to God if there were heaven, but heaven sees so very far from here&quot;).  The album also is helped out by the comforting power of Safe - which is a song I turned to frequently in the aftermath of Sept 11th.  Flowers in the Window is a fun, uplifting, song that always brings a smile to my face.  Other greats are Last Train, and The Cage, both of which show off everything I love about the album - songwriting and instrumentation.  <BR>My only negative comment about the album is the second song, Dear Diary.  It isn't that it is a bad song.  It is most certainly a good song, and does belong on the album.  I just feel as though after the great momentum that Sing brings with the first track, the pace of the album hits a wall just two tracks in.  The song should have been moved to later in the album.  A small complaint, but a complaint nonetheless. <BR>This is a disc that everyone should own, if not for the great songwriting for the amazing musicianship and production.
B00005R2IS|4.0|\\"Mad Max\\" is a pretty simple revenge tale, a rousing sci-fi biker and car-crash-a-thon. Mel Gibson plays Max, a police pursuit driver in an unspecified future where roadgangs terrorize the innocent. Evidently road rage is way out of hand! When motorcycle thugs kill Max's best friend Goose (amiable Steve Bisley), his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son Sprog (!), Max gets mad... and gets even. What elevates this drive-in flick to cult classic status is director George Miller's use of low-riding, wide-angled shots to give the chase scenes an intensity never before seen. And Mel's presence, too, I suppose. Mel looks awful young, but flashes the charm and charisma that keeps him atop the box office charts all these years later.<BR><br />Like all cult movies, \\"Mad Max\\" has its cheesy moments. Max's scenes with his wife feature some goofy dialogue, and there's a very cheap-looking nightclub set at one point. But Hugh Keays-Byrne, as the reprehensible Toecutter, and Tim Burns (an Adam Ant lookalike) as the psychotic Johnny, provide ample menace. Plus, Miller and company throw in some very unusual-looking supporting players. And then there are the spectacular stunts and kinetic camerawork; they've been ripped-off a thousand times since!<BR><br />This \\"Special Edition\\" features a crisp, widescreen print (ooh!) and, even better, the original Australian vocal track (ahh!). Finally, someone wised up and banished the cartoon voices. The original actors perform solidly throughout, even subtly in places. At last, you can see why Samuel Z. Arkoff would bother to import this movie. But why'd he mangle it with bad overdubbing? No matter. The sequel (\\"Road Warrior\\") remains the superior film, but this new-to-the-U.S. version of the first movie provides some adrenaline-inducing adventure. Includes some nice commentary with plenty of inside trivia on the stuntwork and how they risked their lives just filming it! Truly death-defying work. As Max's boss Fifi says, \\"We're gonna give 'em back their heroes!\\"

0684833395|3.0|Catch-22 is a story about a man named Yossarian who is a bombardierfor America during WWII the story is a mix between in-depth story telling and insanity.This book is not intended for the light reader.<br />The book does have it's light flaws like many books do but one of it's most major flaws is it's order of story telling which can only be compared to a Quintin Terentino movie. Which is to say the least mixed up. But the comedy the story offers you over shadows it's flaws. example: Yossarian cant understand why people he has never met want to kill him (trying shoot him down while he's bombing them). This is a good book but if your looking for a quick read this is not the book for you.
B00005QZWI|4.0|this is one of the best sound tracks i've ever heard.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22<br />Catch 22 is a story about a captain who's name is yossairan he is a little crazy in his reactions to thing and his sudden out burst. This feature of the main character is what allows the book to have a fun mood to it at times in the book he will just question everything in life no matter how stupid the question is ex.who's hitler? these ar the type of questions you will find him asking in this WWII setting but the book ssem to also have a dark side which doesnt show until later on and you wonder is this real? The author seems to want to exagerate the characters so they represent the full basis of humanity .<br />The story for Catch-22 seems to be forcing an anti-war theme along with the books story line for the reader can grasp that war is hell even for the people on reserves. But all good books have there problems and so does this book one of the biggest flaws is the sequential order of the chapters there is written in a way that does not follow ordinary time . It's story telling method closely resemble a quintin tarentino film rather than a book. Another diffuculty is the authors use of medaphores you may read sgt.lock heart loves to  parade but in saying parade they really mean how he conducts his bussiness. If you are the type a reader who just reads books for enteratinment only this is not the book for you but if you want to enteratin your self while expanding you brain this book is highly recomended.
B00005UKE0|5.0|It is amazing to listen to this album again and realize how many classic tunes are on it.  George's writing and playing were clearly at their peak, and the beauty of his writing is stunning, even 30 years on.<br />In his updated liner notes, George says he resisted the temptation to remix every track.  I think it would've been real interesting to hear some of these songs stripped down and re-done with new instrumentation.  But now we'll never know.<br />Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame?
B00005QZ7U|3.0|In the commentary on this DVD, the director, Baz Luhrmann, says, &quot;We had to edit out much of the musical and dance sequences to advance the storyline,&quot;. What he misunderstands is that most musicals have a very simple storyline, and that people enjoy them more for their music, dance, and overall style. By trimming these parts, he's left us with a bland, obvious story about forbidden love. Ho hum. Thankfully, the DVD has most of the musical sequences restored as part of the special features. If you appreciated the film's audacity despite its flaws, the DVD is certainly recommended, if only to know what could have been.
B00005R2BG|4.0|well, after reading 50 customer reviews i've been able 2 tell that either you hate it, or you love it. i watched it and ended up loving it.

B000002AZX|5.0|This 1984 album, the last of Cohen's folk masterpieces and one subtly spiced with country, never grows stale due to the intricacy of its arrangements - vocal & instrumental - while perennially revealing deeper layers of metaphysical & symbolic significance. Or as one ages one understands better! Particularly sublime is the interaction of male & female vocals calibrated to bring out the best in both. The devotion and the vocals of Anjani Thomas and [[ASIN:B000OPO6WY Jennifer Warnes]] make a major contribution to the music's enduring beauty.<br /><br />Cohen's gift of melody & rhythm finds buoyant expression in Dance Me to the End Of Love which may sound catchy and even frisky like a simple pop tune but if one pays attention multiple meanings & possibilities emerge. In contrast, Coming Back to You unfolds slowly and solemnly through a graceful melody wed to imagery that navigates delicately between romantic & divine love. The two tracks The Law and The Night Comes On evoke something of [[ASIN:1931082693 John Berryman's]] poetic sensibility ... The Moon and the Night and the Men, The Song of the Tortured Girl and above all, Sonnet number 34.<br /><br />The Night Comes On may be the absolute highlight of this album, a rare gem ranking amongst the greatest of Cohen's songs. Like assembling a pearl necklace, it strings striking images of the domestic & personal, the universal, the spiritual, historical and prophetic on a thread of longing. As the song unfolds, the symbolism unleashes an almost supernatural power that stirs the psyche hinting at or conjuring vague specters of ancient memories. There are close correspondences in the song Anthem on [[ASIN:B0000028W9 The Future]].<br /><br />Being familiar with John Cale's soaring version of Hallelujah on the tribute album [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]] and Jeff Buckley's on Grace, Cohen's own sounds somewhat monotone and subdued, still beautiful but constrained within a narrow range compared to the aforementioned. The tale of David & Batsheba that started with desire, led to murder & a string of tragedies but was ultimately transformed into the redemptive, relies in the songwriter's version on the atmosphere created by the female vocals rather than his voice.<br /><br />The words of the rhythmic lilting song The Captain with its tinkling piano, tangy country flavor & ironic comment on \\"some country-western song\\" contain & conceal more than they reveal as they undulate on the tune & the beat. Then the tempo drops for the cold & alienating Hunter's Lullaby that in arrangement (not mood) resembles the 1979 album [[ASIN:B0000025HJ Recent Songs]]. The message is baffling but may refer to the subconscious impulses that isolate & lead us astray. There is a sense of menace & desolation without the redemptive introspection of The Beast In Me by Nick Lowe on his album [[ASIN:B000003NOZ The Impossible Bird]].<br /><br />Cohen's mysticism, masked or open, infuses every song. It manifests most painfully in Hunter's Lullaby & most inspiringly in The Law, The Night Comes On & The Captain while in Heart With No Companion it shines like a thousand suns. The healing power can go everywhere and reach anyone, only & exactly because it has been shattered. It recalls the crack in everything that allows the light in on the aforementioned Anthem, a reference to the shattering of the vessels as explained in the Arizal's [[ASIN:0765760118 The Tree of Life: Introduction to the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria]] as preserved by Rabbi Vital, and less clearly in the Zohar.<br /><br />The impassioned Heart With No Companion combines a lilting uptempo beat & hypnotic tune with lyrics contemplating disillusionment, shattered dreams & immobilizing fear exacerbated by a terrifying prophecy:  \\"Through the days of shame that are coming/through the nights of wild distress\\". These negatives are all erased, however, by the lines: \\"Now I greet you from the other side/Of sorrow and despair/With a love so vast and shattered/It will reach you everywhere\\".  The defiance expressed by: \\"Though your promise count for nothing/You must keep it none the less\\" is in fact the antidote to nihilism, affirming the primacy of spirit and of the word. Land Of Plenty on [[ASIN:B00005Q45W Ten New Songs]] covers some of the same territory: \\"For the Christ who has not risen/From the caverns of the heart/For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray/May the lights in the land of plenty/Shine on the truth some day\\".<br /><br />If Hunter's Lullaby seemingly submits to despair whilst Heart With No Companion directly defies it, the final song is a prayer of intercession on an ancient pattern, the same to which The Lord's Prayer conforms. With praise and reverence, If It Be Your Will intercedes not only for the tormented souls in hell but for all the children in their \\"rags of light,\\" the remnants of the shattered vessels. As a sung prayer it is as moving as Calling My Children Home performed by Emmylou Harris on [[ASIN:B000009NTV Spyboy]] although it is serene where Emmylou's song yearns with burning heartache. The one represents Rachel weeping for her children whilst the other calms the tempest with trust in the Eternal Divine, knowing that Spirit in mercy overrules The Law (of cause & effect).<br /><br />Revisiting Anjani and Jennifer, I highly recommend the first's inspiring album [[ASIN:B00005K8SO The Sacred Names]] on which she sings in Hebrew, Ancient Greek, Aramaic, Portuguese & English, and the second's sensitive interpretations of Cohen compositions on her Famous Blue Raincoat, the Twentieth Anniversary edition that has been enhanced by four extra tracks: The Night Comes On, Ballad of the Runaway Horse, If It Be Your Will & Joan of Arc live in Antwerp where the Novecento Orchestra, West Brabants Operakoor & De Tweede Adem support Jenny & her band, adding depth to Cohen's elegy to the Maid of Orleans.: \\"Though your promise count for nothing/You must keep it none the less\\" is in fact the antidote to nihilism, affirming the primacy of spirit and of the word.

B00005R2BG|4.0|I have 2 say one thing first, when i sat down 2 watch this movie i DID expect it 2 b MUCH better. i guess i was expecting 2 much, but by the end of the movie i was in tears of joy and happiness. this is a gr8 movie. McGregor has so many sides 2 him. he can play nething and everything ppl throw @ him. whether it being a young writer in search of love, an employee working for the stock-market, or a young ambiscious Jedi apprentice who embarks on a galactic mission and kills an evil sith!! McGregor can do everything!! ecspecially sing. i bought the soundtrack for Moulin Rouge b4 i ever saw the movie. by the time the movie came out on video i was singing along with all the charectors. my friend had 2 tell me 2 sit down and shut-up. well, i can go on all day about how gr8 this movie was and how sexy Ewan McGregor is, but i won't because i'm limited to 1,000 words, so i'll leave you with: &quot;this movie is a gr8 story for everyone 2 see. i recomend it 2 neone who loves singing dancing, AND ABOVE ALL ELSE, LOVE.&quot; lol. :) &gt;&lt;&gt;
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone has got to be one of my top 5 favorite movies. I was never one for westerns, but this movie really had an impact on me. I've watched it countless times, and the initial interest and pleasure at it's viewing hasn't worn off. The new DVD version should be a great improvement over the old...better sound quality, and the much anticipated extra features. I wouldn't hesitate to reccommend this movie to anyone. Val Kilmer is a joy to watch, and the rest of the fairly large cast are excellent. Costner's version wasn't half as enthralling, and I would say that Tombstone holds it's own when placed among the classics concerning Earp and the O.K. corral gunfight (I eventually rented and read everything I could find on the subject). There are quite a few historical inaccuracies, but this doesn't change my opinion that this movie is one of the closest representations of what actually happened. Give yourself a present....watch this movie as soon as possible.
B00005RYQO|5.0|When I watched this movie I thought it was just going to be about cars and how they look when they are hooked up, but when I watched it I noticed it wasn't all just about cars but it had a good meaning behind it.  It's about friendships that people make and how strong they can get in such a short amount of time ( the cars are just a bonus).  This movie had such a good plot behind it, with everything from cars to friendships to love and understanding.  I think this movie is worth 5 stars because it touches apon important things like -friendship -love -trust -family -understanding and forgivness. That is why I loved this movie.  There is nothing they could change to make this a better movie.  The cars where also perfect!
0156012197|4.0|the book is intersesting. it is a book about being a child and seeing the child inside you. it isnt always how u see it but how u interpert it. Also being an adult isnt the glory and fame of being a child in the little princes mind.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I liked this album, even though it was different from No Doubt's previous two. I think anyone who doesn't at least moderately like it aren't giving it a chance. I think Gwen was just trying to do something different and it worked. I've seen them in concert before and they are an awesome live band and I can't wait to see them perform these songs.
B00005ASOI|3.0|On the plus side, I liked the overall creepiness; the music by The Goblins (which helped in a big way to bring about that creepiness); and the many unsettling and scary individual scenes throughout the movie.  I'm just not sure how well the whole thing held together as a coherent, satisfying story.  But the movie is at least worth a look, especially with the good job Anchor Bay did in sprucing it up for a new generation of movie fans.
B00005JCA9|5.0|While Notting Hill may be a bit of a trifle as motion pictures go, it's an amusing and entertaining way to while away an afternoon.  Julia Roberts radiates her characteristic charm as Anna Scott, and Hugh Grant puts a high polish on his trademark bumbling as William, the humble London bookstore owner.  The film offers a glimpse into one of London's most charming districts, an is a witty self-referencing look at Ms. Roberts herself.  <br />The Ultimate Edition DVD is amazing, with music videos and featurettes about the film.  I particulary enjoyed the behind-the -scenes look at how they shot William's walk down Portobello Rd. during the changing seasons.  The packaging is very attractive, particulary the fact that you can open it up to reveal the wall with Julia's face on it without the overlay of Hugh Grant and the title of the film, which is something I've wanted to do since I first saw this poster.  <br />All in all, a charming flick by a charming actress.
B00005A46T|4.0|Now that I've had a few months to ponder this beast of a record, having had a tumultuous love/hate affair with it since late August, I can say objectively it's a pretty darned good piece of work.  I think what it comes down to is I over-hyped it in my brain due to my absolute obsession with their self-titled album.  I was expecting out of Iowa the same sort of out of body experience I had with said S/T, didn't get it, felt lots of resentment towards it, but eventually embraced it for what it is:  A full tilt, swaggering, lumbering, all y'all can kiss my ..., go for broke, \\"if you don't like it that's too ... bad\\" beast of a sophomore effort.  As far as the disappointing sales Iowa has taken in, I think it comes down to the fact people didn't know what the hell to think of it.  Only time will tell how this one ages.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This album is very different from the previous ones, even \\"Return of Saturn\\", but I really like it. I think the reason why I like it so much is because I've been a No Doubt fan for many years and I'm a person who likes all kinds of music. There is more of a Reggae/Pop sound to this album, but it still has many of the qualities that have made other No Doubt albums so good: Gwen's voice is awesome, her lyrics are relatable and more interesting than the lyrics of most artists, their music is not quite like any other group's, it's energetic and infectious. My favorite songs on this album are \\"Underneath It All\\", \\"In My Head\\", \\"Rock Steady\\" and the catchy \\"Hey Baby\\", but you know what--all of the songs are good, a lot of them are very catchy and the musical arrangements are great. Another terrific album and another great accomplishment for No Doubt!
0553573403|5.0|I'M NOT NORMALLY A FANTASY FAN, BUT I PICKED THIS UP AT THE AIRPORT AND GOT HOOKED.  I'VE FINISHED ALL THREE VOLUMES NOW IN PRINT AND AM IMPATIENTLY AWAITING NUMBER 4 (OUT OF 6 PROJECTED).  THE CHARACTERS ARE NICELY INDIVIDUALIZED AND THE STORY CARRIES YOU ALONG AT A REMARKABLE CLIP FOR SUCH MASSIVE BOOKS.  MY ONLY CRITICIZM IS THAT THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE IMAGINATION IN COMING UP WITH NAMES IN THIS ALTERNATE WORLD (SOME ARE JUST LIKE OURS, &quot;ROBERT&quot; FOR EXAMPLE, AND SOME ARE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED LIKE &quot;EDDARD&quot; FOR EDWARD.  THE CHARACTERS SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME THAN I'D LIKE WANDERING FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITHOUT GETTING ANYWHERE, BUT THE ACTION MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IT.  THE WORK IS ALSO VERY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE IN DESCRIBING LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES (WITH THE MINOR ADDITION OF DRAGONS AND WALKING DEAD.)  A GREAT READ!
0345409671|5.0|Anne Rice has truly done it, a story so unbelievable that if written by anyone other than Rice herself it would be complete absurdity.  Anne Rice is a true master of the craft, which is so obviously displayed in this story.  Rice boldly travels where few authors have ever dared, Heaven and hell itself. A rich and dazzling tale made for true intellectual thought, this isn't just a story to be read passively.   Rice has pain stainkenly and passionately described both sides of heaven and hell.  Yet with true Anne Rice style she has made it an open ending for the reader to decide fact from fiction.  Can't you see the true genius of the irony in it?   The reader is so consumed deciding which side is truth that you completely forget its only fiction.  Memnoch is absolute genius, completely brilliant.

0471381985|5.0|I am a professional investor (CFA charter holder and portfolio manager) and would suggest this book for anyone interested in the value style of investing. I would not recommend the book for a novice investor since some terminology is not explained. (Perhaps read this book after reading and understanding Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor.) However, the book is an excellent read for someone with an understanding of investing.  The book is divided into two main parts: The authors' views of different ways to value a company and profiles of successful value investors.<br />I think the authors' Earnings Power Value (EPV) approach to valuing a company is cutting edge. (Basically EPV is a rehash of Enterprise Value.) Most investors tend to value stocks based on P/E ratios - only looking at equity in a company. However, the proper way to value a company is to look at its whole capital structure - Debt, Equity &amp; Cash. EPV is a much better tool than the P/E ratio for calculating whether a company is undervalued.<br />The second part of the book that profiles a half dozen or so successful value investors is interesting. It illustrates there are many different ways to execute a value oriented approach. The profiles do not give any hard cut rules that each investor follows, but it does give you a general idea. (I have been successful at applying some of the ideas in managing my own account.) The only flaw of the profiles is the lack of any type of track record. It would have been helpful to list the year-by-year returns for each investor compared to an index. (i.e. S&amp;P 500 Index)<br />Overall, it's a great book and it deserves a spot behind Ben Graham's Security Analysis and Intelligent Investor.
0767020308|5.0|This version of &quot;Emma&quot; is much better than the Gwyneth Paltrow version, mainly because you don't get wrapped up in what star is playing what role.  It's a warm, funny, good-hearted movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had it on tape since it first aired on A&amp;E, but the tape is so worn out, I repurchased it on DVD.
B00005JKES|5.0|You can buy the pilot on DVD as an import from Taiwan. And yes, it will play on any DVD player, because it is on Region 0. I ordered it myself. The video and audio quality isn't as great as this set, but it is not bad, and definitely worth buying.<br />...And as most people would tell you, I would recommend waiting to buy the pilot before seeing the first season, ESPECIALLY if you've never seen the show before. There's just no point without the pilot.
B00000IQW3|5.0|I must have seen this movie when I was like 10 years old and it's totally stuck to my head. Just remembering the starfighter spinning its way to blow up alien ships gives me great memories. A must-buy for those who truly remember this film!
B000002N2P|5.0|THIS CD KICKS MAJOR BUTT! I don't know why some of their other CDs get so much hype when this is really Green Day at their best.<BR>This is a CD I can pretty much listen to straight through without skipping tracks. There isn't a &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;annoying&quot;, or &quot;downright stupid&quot; track on the whole disc, a comment which I can't say about any other Green Day CD. The best tracks are &quot;Stuck With Me&quot;, &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, &quot;Bab's Uvula Who?&quot;, <BR>&quot;Brain Stew&quot;, &quot;Jaded&quot; and &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot;. Don't get me wrong, all the other tracks are good in some way, but those tracks mentioned are definitely top-notch. So if you are a Green Day fan of any sort, BUY THIS CD!!! You won't regret it!
B000059TPN|5.0|Any movie that belongs to the criterion collection deserves 5 stars in my opinion. The intense action and suspense in &quot;The Rock&quot; will keep you hanging on to your HT setup
B00005QZWI|5.0|As could be said about Peter Jackson's amazing interpretation of the Rings, Shore's soundtrack is dark, urgent, and beautiful.  Particular tracks warrant attention.<br />First, track 1 (The prophecy) serves as an operatic overture.  The music is mysterious and violent, promising doom, but also suggests hope in its final bars, where the hobbit's tune is presented. <br />The second track gives the hobbit music its full treatment. It is a troubador's tune, used both to show the pastoral beauty hobbits stand to lose if their mission fails, and to bookend an otherwise epic movie with simpler -- if I may say so -- &quot;human&quot; emotion.  The Lord of the Rings is an epic myth.  The greatest difficulty in translating an epic onto the movie screen is conveying its grandeur without making it seem grandiose.  Beginning and ending with the hobbit's tune grounds the movie, quite literally, in the soil.<br />The next several tracks accompany the hobbits on the road, fleeing from one danger to the next.  The music is right on.  In particular, the metal on metal banging in track 7, used to convey the menace of the ringwraiths, is fantastic.<br />Track nine, the music of Rivendell, is beautiful in its own right, quite separate from the movie. In context, however, most worth mentioning is its air of autumn, of gold turning to brown turning to earth.  Shore defines the elves musically as Tolkien did on paper, as a waning power in a changing world.  The music conveys this nicely.<br />A particularly favorite track of mine is number 11, which follows the Fellowship out of Rivendell and on their way south toward Gondor and Mordor.  The rise of heroic brass as the Fellowship strides over an escarpment (this was in the teaser trailer) makes them seem like myths walking the earth.  It is remarkable.  I doubt the scene could have worked without the music.<br />Track 12 is also nice, particularly when the music opens up to show the failed majesty of the dwarrowdelf, once the greatest of mortal achiements, now grown black and empty. <br />Track 13 is exciting as hell, accompanying the Fellowship on their last dash through moria.  <br />Finally, number 17 brings back the earthy &quot;humanism&quot; of the hobbits'tune, now transformed by the heroic brass tune of the Fellowship.  The combination captures the spirit of the story magnificently.  This is not a hero's tale of swords and sorcery, it is the tale of a normal man become heroic by his decency and courage in the face of despair and despite the powers warring about him.  The final lyrics are sad but strong, and conclude with Tolkien's own title, There and Back Again.<BR>  <BR>It is in fact the score's sincerity that makes it work.  Unlike the mock heroics of most (if not all) film fantasies, Shore's score and Jackson's movie take their material seriously, profoundly even.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This great film will truly give any kid, and even adults a sense of adventure. I'm giving this film 5 stars for its sheer originality and great effects!
0875847706|5.0|I purchased my first copy of \\"The Art of Possibility\\" after attending a Boston Philharmonic concert.  After the concert, the authors were promoting their book.  At one point, while I was uncertain, they offered to buy it for me and told me how important reading the book would be.  Well, I am writing to tell you that that it has had a profound effect on me and I am thankful for their persistence.  I have already purchased more than 10 copies for friends and business associates.  I am thankful to the Zander's for sharing their stories with their readers.  It is a timeless book that touches the very essence of being a human being and how to see things in a new light.  I look forward to reading their next book!
B00003CY0V|5.0|Hmmmm if you had limitless resources and had a job to do how far would you actually go?  This movie asks that question and the morality of it.  You will toss and turn from loving and hating the good guys and bad guys and most of the time you don't know which it is.  John Travolta gives the movie his original character flair as he always does in one of his smoothest performances yet.  Overal, I give this a top notch rating.  If you like action thrillers this is a keeper.

0060001941|4.0|This novel is as much a snapshot of the first twenty years of Brooklyn's twentieth century as it is a book about a family that anyone can sympathize with and relate to.  This is Francie Nolan's story yet at the same time, through this girl, we become part of her family and part of her world.  Betty Smith writes with such detail that I felt like I had lived the life she wrote for Francie and as I ate up the pages in between my first meeting with Francie up until I said good-bye to her as a grown-up, I was certain that I shared a special bond with her even though our worlds are years and states away.  Not in the least a disappointment.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I first read about Le Grand Bleu in one of my textbooks when I started lessons at the Alliance Francais. There it was described along the lines of a massive cult movie that had charmed (and completely depressed) a whole generation of french teenagers. Being fifteen at the time, I got hold of a very beat up copy and it has since remained my favorite film of all times.<BR>Jacques, the main character, is a solitary free diver who longs for nothing else than to be at home with his family (i.e. swimming in the sea with dolphnins). That is, until he meets Johanna (Arquette), and soon the story develops and reaches its climax as Jacques is torn between the woman he loves and his quest for the eternal and watery bliss he finds in the depths. The photography is simply perfect, and the transfer to digital media has only enhanced the fact, so definitely get the DVD. Reno is at his finest (and funniest) and Barr stands out as the perfect homo delphinus.<BR>I have seen the US version, which is a moldy disgrace. The omission of Eric Serra's music is utter blasphemy, since the soundtrack is a jewel on its own. The change in ending is also nonsense, so if you have only seen that piece of editing, know that the Director's Cut is entirely different.<BR>Oh, and don't forget. Dolphins, dolphins and more dolphins! What could beat that? I cry every time I see this film. Perhaps this is only because of my weird self, but, what do you think really happens to Jacques in the end?
0553213105|3.0|I found Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to be a historically informative and interesting read. I am fascinated with the society and culture of the past, and find that only through reading can I visit this era. I found the dialogue very amusing as well as the characters mannerisms and behavior. As to their behavior, Ms. Austen could not have captured the essence of human nature any better than she did. She is able to show people's tendency to be insecure; selfish; arrogant; judgmental; opportunistic, and overly passionate. Elizabeth Bennet, was refreshingly unconventional with her frank and direct honestly and her wry humor. The conclusion satisfies the thirst for an outpouring of emotion, for Ms. Austin establishes a good degree of tension, which increases the farther in the story one goes. What I found unfavorable was the plot's slow progression and its tendency to drag. Mr. Darcy is rarely heard in the beginning although I admit he does appear more during the end. I also feel that Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy lasted too long, which resulted in choking the romance out of it. Along with its slow progression, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. This is due in part to the language that I find simultaneously charming, as well as to the characters' tendencies to go on and on about a subject of no particular importance.
B00005RHGK|3.0|By now, if you have scanned other reviews, the common complaints are the usual horror film pitfalls, dumb characters.  You will also notice complaints about dialogue and plot threads which are never fully explained.  Aside from these drawbacks, Jeepers Creepers has some very creepy moments and successfully creates an atmosphere of dread.  The creature is done well.  While there are no real surprises, the results are still shocking.  From the mural on the ceiling of dead victims to the end sequence.  I will not deny the film provided some scares but perhaps the most disturbing element is how one might interpret this film. When you review the director's filmography, you will note that there is a gap between pictures.  This gap is when the director was serving time for child molestation.  Knowing this, and watching this film will make you shudder even more.  With this piece of information, you will find a multitude of disturbing interpretations.  It is really for you to decide now if you can stomach it.
B00005QIPH|1.0|that's about all there is to say. do not waste your money on this stuff -- it's a lot cheaper and more enjoyable to just dig out those old VU records. it is sad that corporate america has coopted the underground.
B000056K04|4.0|First off, everyone will tell you that this album is very different from all of his DMB's other albums. I agree, but that doesn't make it bad. There are songs I like, songs I hate, and songs I love. I happen to hate &quot;I did it&quot;, but &quot;When the world ends&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;Dreams of our fathers&quot;, and &quot;Everyday&quot; are amazing. But don't take my word for it. I don't profess to be a professional music critic. Listen to the songs yourself. Click on the links below or download some of the songs from kazaa. You won't be disappointed.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Star power, but weak Hollywood plot.  Cool opening scene, but that's it.
B00005LB9O|3.0|The title sums it up.<br />First of all: I do like this album, and I think &quot;Side&quot; is perhaps among their best work so far.<br />But there's one little problem with this album: while there are no bad songs in this record, it's just TOO nice. I feel like it lacks something (a couple of more energetic choruses wouldn't hurt).<br />I mean, it is very unlikely that you'll listen to these songs and go &quot;OHHHH YEAHHHHHHH!!!&quot;. No. You'll probably think <BR>&quot;hum...that's OK&quot;.<br />It's a good, worth buying album, but you may feel a little let down because of the high standarts set by their previous releases &quot;Good Feeling&quot; and &quot;The Man Who&quot;.<br />Anyways, enjoy it.
B00005QIPH|1.0|a question i have been asking myself ever since i have heard the the name this band mentioned on every magazine cover and review out there.well the answer of course is NO!!!!they will probably out live all there influences such as television,iggy pop,and of course lou reed,.why because every one still buys into the hype of these kinds of albums.this album is as typical as any album thats was put together buy some garage band that borrows from all there influences and has no originality at all.just retro in its finest hour.so to sum it up if you werent there the first time around for lets say the velvet underground.here is your chance to hear the 4th generation watererd down version of the band .just wait until you can buy this in the 99 cent section of the used record store then it might be it.........
B000002BBY|5.0|There isn't much to say about this album, because the songs speak for themselves, so I'll just say that this one record makes you want to do things better, makes you want to jump out of bed and step out on the street for a full day. <br />In other words: it gives you courage to be yourself.<br />One of the all-time best rock'n'roll albums: not only music, but inspiration.

THE SOUND IS THE BEST I EVER HEARD AND IT CAPTURES THE REAL CONCERT PERFORMANCE.  ROGER IS A TRUE PERFORMER AND POURS HIS HEART OUT TO MAKE THIS A TRULY REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE!
B000002UAF|5.0|These timeless pieces need to be included as part of a generations nuance typical for its genre'. <BR>The lyrics resonate ageless juvenile explorations with comming of age while the music exemplifies individuale artistic innovation of the current emotion and feelings of the artists involved. <BR>This should not come as a surprize as each previous generation has exhibited nothing new as to feelings, emotions, fads or other factors of influence.<BR>Robert Ponce
B00003CY0V|3.0|It was a kind of good movie but the characters don't fit.  Hugh Jackman is not a computer nerd. It doesn't fit.
B00005R87Q|3.0|I've seen this film (or at least the same story) about four or five times, but the characters were riding horses, not super-tuned cars.<br />The plot -- such as it is -- is a thin excuse to hang the cars, girls and stunts on, but it's a good, solid, time-proven plot that works real good.  ((My step-daughter, who has borne my dissertations on why the remake of &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; was inferior to the original due to the producers insisting on adding a plot, pointed out that this film has a plot and it's pretty good.  I allowed as how that was because it was a plot that made sense.))<br />While the thrust of the film (and of the article that inspired it) involves super-tuned asian sedans, the big set-piece stunt sequence and finale of the film involves a truly awesome nine-second blown Dodge, proving once again that there's no real substitute for plain old cubic inches to really move the mail.<br />Most of the cast are adequate to their jobs; Vin Diesel is the outstanding exception, recalling a young Lee Marvin in hi portrayal of a tough man who knows he's tough and doesn't need to prove it.<br />The truck highjacking sequences belong in anohter movie -- no way this sort of Road Warrior-style stuff would be able to go on without the cops showing up.  The interactions between the local cops and the FBI are typical movie stuff; amusing but improbable.<br />And that final stunt -- though not the equal of the final stunt in the original &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; -- is both spectacular and appropriate to the overall form and content of the film.<br />Fun, some really nice driving/stunt sequences, nothing really durable to take away with you but you won't find yourself considering demanding a refund of your wasted time, as i did after the &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; remake.
0385505833|2.0|I usually enjoy his books, but I was disappointed with this one.  The plot just seemed to repeat itself over and over until I grew quite bored.  I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
B00005R2IS|5.0|For fans of George Miller's first &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie, this is the version for which we've been waiting more than 20 years for . . . the original Australian dialogue version.  While the American voice actors tried to do their best to capture the characters and the synchronization was generally good, the dubbing, on the whole, lacks the subtleties that the original actors, speaking in their natural dialect, brought to the screen.  Further, in the U.S. dubbed version, there was no appreciable attempt to change the Australian slang used thoughout the film, making the dubbing even more pointless than it already was.<br />Beyond the new audio track, there is much more on this DVD to merit inclusion in your collection.  The DVD presents the film in both anamorphic widescreen and full-frame formats.  Now why anyone would want to watch &quot;Mad Max&quot; in full-frame is beyond me, but you can effectively recreate the VHS viewing experience of the last 15 plus years by selecting the full-frame video and U.S. dub audio options.  There are also two newly produced, informative documentaries included, one on the making of the film and the other on the early Australian (pre-1980) film career of Mel Gibson.  There's also a terrific audio commentary with several of the behind-the-scenes film crew members, including the Director of Photography, David Eggby.  In one telling sequence, Eggby mentions that he had no idea how fast and dangerous the filming actually was while seated on the back seat of a motorcycle for a POV shot.  It was only after he saw the daily rushes one day, that he noticed that the speedometer of the bike appeared in the shot and that it registered 180 kilometers per hour (approximately 110 mph)!<br />The DVD also includes the usual trailer and TV spots, a photo gallery of international posters and lobby cards, and even a hidden, but not too difficult to find &quot;Easter Egg.&quot;  All in all, MGM has done a superlative job on this &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD, easily exceeding, by a far margin, the two sequel DVDs released by Warner's (&quot;The Road Warrior&quot; and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;).
B00005TT77|5.0|This is a beaultiful soundtrack...<BR>I am a huge Sean Penn movie, his films are always great, and he is a wonderful and very talented actor...<BR>But this soundtrack is something else, there are wonderful versions of great Beatles tunes.<BR>Eddie Vedder doing &quot;hey You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; is beaultiful and touching.<BR>The versions of Strawberry fields, BlackBird and Revolution are really beaultiful and touching, specially Strawberry Fields by Ben Harper.<br />You're in for a treat.....this is a must for every Beatles fan and also for the fan of music in general
B00000G3Q4|5.0|In the modern age of horror cinema, a list of greatest films, <BR>would not be complete without The Evil Dead. This baby ranks right up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday The 13th. <br />The woodsy atmosphere is apart of the 70's/80's horror legacy and Sam Raimi and crew with actors like Bruce Campbell, perfectly capture the whole deal! The several moments of gore are some of horror's greatest and most interesting. The photography rarely ever stands still in Raimi's films, and that style is definitely apart of what help make this a gem in the annals of horror history!<br />To see this double-billed with Texas Chainsaw Massacre at a Drive-in, now that I'd give my hand for....of course only for a chainsaw in return. GROOOOOVYYYYY

6305137293|5.0|The suspense may have not been as well crafted as Halloween 1, but this one is still one of my favorite horror movie sequels, right up there with Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman. This baby was handled very well, so well that, there's really no reason why this shouldn't be watched right after the first film. <BR>I'd like to refer to this as the Empire Stikes Back of horror sequels, if it weren't for the epic George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead. The nudity and gore in this one are nicely handled to show-off artistic freedom, if not just for fun. The widescreen aspect ration of this film is apart of what defines this series as artistic campyness. Following entries like Halloween 4 and 5 would fail to administer much suspense, for my liking. But Halloween 6 and H20 returned the series to integrity, if not always coherent continuity

6305546789|5.0|For sheer simplicity, this may be one of horror's greatest achievements in the celluloid universe. This DVD version is absolutely incredible. The only better way to watch this flick would be in a Drive-In or Indoor theatre. John Carpenter and company pulled out a hit horrorfest that is considered today, a classic of it's media. Even though some of my favorite JC pictures are Big Trouble In Little China and They Live, Carpenter never really came close to the success he had with this movie. This movie would make an absolute wonderful theatrical re-release. The atmosphere... the quietness leading up to the exciting climax. Carpenter did everything here as good as Hitchcock did with Psycho.  The character of Michael Myers is wonderful. He and his Shatner mask have become apart of The monster movie pantheon with Dracula, The Monster, Wolfman, Freddy and Jason etc.<br />Watch out for Halloween 8!!!
B00005RYKV|2.0|Sony Pictures has tampered with the colors in Brother .<br />Colors are not to be changed, they are to be left to their original tint or brightness. <br />Today I bought Brother at Best Buy. I was happy to find that I got the last copy from the 2 shelves that<BR>                            held them. I was surprised that it was there, so I bought it. When I got to opening it, there was some<BR>                            nice cover art on the disc, and no  collecter's booklet like on most Sony discs. I popped the disc<BR>                            in to my new Panasonic RP56 and set down to watch on my Phillips 16:9 HDTV. Never have I seen a film<BR>                            murdered in front of my eyes.<br />                            Aniki's(main character) world is not thrilling but grim. It is somewhat gloomy. There is an occasional color<BR>                            flair(rare) to hint at a character's personality. Blacks are deep and accurate. There is tons of gray. Blue is<BR>                            on the dark side, green is in some scenes dark and other scenes light, finally red is crimson, and<BR>                            sometimes darker. All of this is represented accurately on the two DVD's I have previously watched(UK<BR>                            and Japan) and seen in a THX certified theater. The theater I saw the movie was dead on colorwise, and<BR>                            the picture quality was unbeatable. <br />                            The above is thrown out the window in the Sony Pictures Classics version. Gray is subdued and no longer<BR>                            prevalent. Blacks are ruined. This killed quite a number of scenes. Blue is no longer dark or a little dark,<BR>                            it's just plain blue. Green is a neon green in some scenes and now is a bright. Red is pushed, but just<BR>                            enough that the color is a bit lighter. <br />                            The beginning scene is tarnished by the Sony version. Takeshi Kitano is standing waiting for a cab. In the<BR>                            scene, Takeshi Kitano is supposed to stick out, and the background is covered with a thin gray, to make<BR>                            him prevalent. Instead the Sony Pictures Classic version completely takes out the gray, and the scene is<BR>                            then butchered. The scene where Kitano murders the Latino drug dealer the blacks are deep, the colors<BR>                            subdued. The Sony Pictures Classic version, pushes the flesh tones until the point of absurdity. The<BR>                            blacks are off, and the green door to the left of Claude Maki is now a bright neon green, whereas the<BR>                            other versions had the door dark green or a light pine green. <br />                            There also to seems to be a fairly large quantity of edge enhancement, which is absent on the 3 other<BR>                            sources. Everything is made vibrant, which makes no sense considering this is a very dark movie. <br />                            What doesn't help the Sony Pictures Classics version is that its edited. The movie begins with a Sony<BR>                            Pictures Classics label pasted over the Kitano label, with the background music still there. This tells you<BR>                            that, you are about to view an inferior version. There are various edits to the movie digitally. Such as<BR>                            painting over brain matter on walls from gun shot's, and time and gore edits. The stark emotion of the<BR>                            Hagakure scene is also killed by the editing. <br />                            The features? Just some stupid trailers for some movies that remind me of the word... The<BR>                            audio is sub par, and with the lack of DTS, it not worth the purchase. They did fix the subtitle problem I<BR>                            had with Japan Version, but I fixed that when I traded it in for the United Kingdom version.
B00005RJ1U|5.0|When I saw this film I knew I was in for a ride, and what a great treat for horror fans! This was way better than Scream and <BR>Blair Witch Project and overall just one of the great horror films in the past 10 years or so. When I walked out of the theatre I thought maybe this was what it felt like for people to see A Nightmare On Elm Street.
0618002251|5.0|As an avid reader of fantasy books (Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, J.k Rowling, Countless others) I was looking for a good tale and some nice &quot;by the fire&quot; reading. What I got was &quot;another world&quot;, in truth I finished the whole series + The Hobbit in little more than 5 days. J.R.R Tolkien is simply insane, insane as in amazingly imaginative and GOOD. J.R.R Tolkien has created a complex world of many facets. The interesting details and the strong characterization, conflicts all drew me in right into the story. I left the book five days after I started with hatred for Sauron, contempt for Saruman, disgust for Gollum, peace for Frodo and fright for the One Ring. The detailed world that J.R.R Tolkien created has left me impacted. As a normal guy though I say to you really, don't be dismayed at the slow start, as past the first few chapters the book becomes packed with action. Conflicts of the mind, sacrifice, sorrow, greed, envy, mercy, treachery, giant battles, victories, losses all jam packed into this series of wonderful books by J.R.R Tolkien. I definitely recommend this book to everyone, and I know it will remain in my heart and I will read it over and over again.

B00005QDW1|3.0|I think that this is a good CD. When I first got it and listened to it, i was kinda disappointed because i think that they should have put more of their orginal music of ska/punk in it. some songs do sound like their past albums, but it has this hip-hop Jamaican tunes to it. It's cool but it's not really No Doubt. I think that they should have put more time on the album and keep making great music like they used to, and this CD sounds more mature and Gwen's voice is still great and all, but maybe make the songs a little bit like No Doubt should be?? well i guess this CD is good to listen to when you are all happy and wanna dance :)

B000002LRX|5.0|The first FNM album I picked up was &quot;The Real Thing&quot;.  Like many albums that later grow on me and stick with me, I put it down after a couple listens, not too impressed by most of the album except the first few songs.  A full year later, I pulled it back off the shelf for a car trip and with a different frame of mind it was like a new album, now one of my favorites.<br />At that point I started looking for other FNM albums, and what a glorious wonder was in store for me!  Every FNM album with Mike Patton stands as a completely unique work of art.  As someone else already posted, they are true Chameleons.  Angel Dust is by far their best work, although the dark nature of the later tracks makes it a tougher listen than Album of the Year or The Real Thing, in my opinion.  My favorite song is easily &quot;Everything's Ruined&quot;, sadly it reminds me of some of the things I screwed up in my life.  How everyone expects a certain potential out of you and you devote your life to that at the expense even of your friends.  As you can see this is an album that affects me on a deep emotional level, something that can't be said for most albums.<br />There's not much else to say that hasn't already been said!  Buy this album!  &quot;HERE'S HOW TO ORDER&quot;!
B00000JSJC|5.0|i saw this movie in the theater in NYC and it was so powerful that when angela basset is getting the... kick out of her by the LAPD and i little black kid jumps on on of the riot police, thus inciting a riot, every black audiece member (which was about 90% os the people there) started sceaming and there was almost a real riot. i wasn't sure if i was getting out alive. and then, after all of that (and several other conspiratorial happenings which i won't reveal), the movie ends up being just a love story, i loved it! it seemed to be about so much, to be saying so many things, racial barriers, addiction, ect. But it comes down to the end and says all that really matters are the people you love and the people who love you and knowing who really cares or what's best for you. it was beautiful, and i have never seen an audiece react to a film like that (unless the film really...). the performances are fantastic and ralph finnes is wonderful in a role that isn't exactly what he's known for. and cameron's script is mearly flawless, makes you wonder how he fell from this to Titanic.
0783229526|5.0|i'm not exactly sure how to review this movie, aside from saying that it is my favorite movie ever. i have watched Fear and Loathing 151 times, soon to be 152. my favorite things about this movie are... 1.) the performaces, johnny depp and benicio del toro blow my mind, they a nearly unrecognizabe (depp is bald) and almost unintelligable (i recommend watching the film with closed captioning at least once) and it all works perfectly. and the people performing around them are so real that you actually find the main characters plausible. 2.) the visuals, there is so much stuff in each of terry gilliam's frames that i find something new to see everytime i watch. 3.) the fact that  nothing means nothing. there is so much visual symbolism and so many american lifestyle icons are blasted in this movie that you'd think it was about something, or trying to make some statement. alas, the characters making these statement are so tripped out that they can never finish a though or opinion (which is the point of each of these exercises), the characters just forge ahead, making their way through based on their optimistic energy (and mescaline). this is a perfect statement in itself, illustrating the generation that hunter thompson was writing for, beautifully and without satire or malice (see johnny depp's \\"high water mark\\" speech near the end of the film). but mostly i love this film because it is bombastic and absurd entertainment about two men who just want to have fun and do what ever they please...
B00000JOIG|2.0|What they do not tell you on the cover is that some of the tracks have been edited down in length. For &quot;I Was Only Joking&quot;, that means that about thirty seconds of the nice acoustic guitar solo in the middle of the song were deleted. You get a few seconds of acoustic, then it goes right into the electric lead (I thought my CD player had skipped when I first heard it). It's not even a good edit. On Maggie May, the acoustic prelude is omitted, and the fade at the end comes about 15 seconds sooner than the original. I did not bother to listen to the rest to see what else is missing. I returned it as &quot;defective&quot; in that the contents are incomplete.
B0000026UV|5.0|What a treat this disc is.  I knew Chet Atkins as a kid because my father played many of his records.  Some I felt were outstanding, others I could pass on.  Regardless, you have to admit that Chet was an excellent and entertaining guitarist.  Mark Knopfler has been a favorite of mine since the first Dire Straits album on through all of his solo work.  His unique tone and approach to rock, pop, jazz and country blues guitar is distinctive and to me is about as good as it gets.<br />Combining these two distinct yet complimentary guitar voices was very synergistic.  Students of these masters should not have much trouble picking out who is playing what.  The sound quality is excellent with very good imaging and ambience.  If you like either of these guys, I think you'll like this disc.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|It's easy to get lost in this disc.  Far from being a collection with alot of commercial appeal, it's probably the band's most artistic statement.  There are no short, made-for-radio songs on this disc.  These are longer, more intoxicating songs for the most part, with a sort of cinematic flavor to them.  The production quality is very fitting, with a huge, enveloping soundstage that sucks the listener in.  Remember that this was an analog recording, but don't think of that as a detriment.  Even today, many digital recordings are of significantly lower quality.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is a great cd. I just wish it was more than 34 min. long. I like every single song on it. They're all really well done. If you are a fan of Enya, or just somebody who likes something that is relaxing and always nice to listen to, get this!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Many people think only of &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; when this album is mentioned, but it is a very solid effort, front to back.  When I first heard it, I recognized excellent musicianship from all of the band members.  It's easy to notice Mark's outstanding guitar playing, but check out the drumming, bass and rhythm work.  Impeccible, funky and addictive.<br />Sultans may have been overplayed, but it still holds up well.  As much as I thought I'd heard all the song had to offer, the last time I saw it played live, Mark brought out a few new variations.  He still apparently loves his trademark solo, and so do I.  I'm stiull hooked on the album as a whole.  Classic, must-have disc, excellent sound quality for the period.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot still shakes me after all these days like a bundle of lit scent - whenever I go near, I am struck by the religious smell and felt the sentiment deep down. It still wets my eyes when I portrait the father's shivering lips when he sat in the ballet theatre watching on the stage and the very son of his, flied out from the side a beautiful swan, high in the air, wildly expressive and immensely powerful. Who wouldn't shiver and been stunned by the astonishing moment of love? I remember it was the boyish call out from the top of a short wall in the small town of miners and simple cascaded houses, `Ouy, dancing boy!', that the first streams of tears came down my cheek, unbearably. It's been an inevitable opening of a full blown reservoir. My flooded heart started to pound as it would like, the fullest, with the rhythm of each pulling of its nerves by nothing but love. The moment the two big iron men lightly fought over the right to carry the suitcase of the baby kid's, on the down slope towards the bus stop seemed so lean yet touching, forcing one to feel the uncontrollable passion of love heated through the cold surface of those dark jackets and stubbornly sticking dark hair. It really doesn't need a big budget and big stars to make a movie shine. Billy Elliot once again proved this convincingly. The whole movie was tense without any dull moments, touching without any artificial tear forcing effort and long lasting like nothing of the Hollywood momentary big stuns. It expresses passion and love, like many of the other movies try to capture, with its unique and tender caress, over the most realistic people and their simple lives. My heart goes to Billy Elliot, the boy, the family, the movie and its most invincible passion and love, of all.
B00003CXRM|5.0|After reluctantly watching this movie with my wife, I found that both of us weren't exactly sure what we just saw after it was over, but we were sure that we liked it. In fact, we have watched it 2 more times and now find ourselves laughing more each time we watch it. There is a underlying moral to the story that comes out in the end  -- -This is a definite must see!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Far be it from me to criticize other's taste in film, my own is pretty eclectic.  But I really can't figure out some of these reviews.  Moulin Rouge is sheer entertainment - exhuberent and lovely. When I saw it in a crowded (sold out)theatre, the audience was so appreciative that they applauded between numbers and gave the film a seven-minute standing ovation at the end. <br />Film is a collaborative art, not only in its production but in its performance.  What one sees in the film is, ultimately, what one brings to the film. My only explanation for the few bad reviews, therefore, is that perhaps the video incarnation of Moulin Rouge is somehow a less rich experience than the theatrical performance.  Seeing movies in solitude is a great way to study them (left brain activity) but a very poor way to enjoy them (right brain activity).  Film critics see movies in solitude - usually in special screenings arranged before the premiere.  Film lovers, though, enjoy the electricity and excitement of a shared experience.  Love is only love when it is shared.<br />I have never been particularly fond of Nicole Kidman, but she shines here, reminding me of a young, beautiful and talented Ann Margaret.  When Kidman moved from &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; into &quot;Material Girl&quot; the audience became ecstatic, laughing and applauding the goofy incongruity which, nevertheless, worked.   Ewan McGregor's voice quavers a bit on the high notes, but I think it might be intentional -- after all, those notes mark a high point of emotion. The rest of his singing voice is fine and full.  Both of them are incredibly beautiful to look at and there is palpable chemistry between them.<br />Yes, the story is thin -- but we're talking &quot;fairy tale&quot; here, not Tolstoy - it IS light, airy, weightless, almost. So was Shakespeare's &quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;. It is giddy and sometimes silly, but so is being in love.<br />With the exception of those musicals thatmoved from stage to screen, few movie musicals have completely original scores.  One of the greatest movie musicals, Singing in the Rain, is COMPLETELY a rehash of older material.  When talkies began and musicals became popular, Warner Brothers bought a huge catalogue of standards and simply recycled them through most of their movie musicals from the early 30's through the late 50's.  Yes, it is a bit disconcerting to hear Elton John and the Beatles (not to mention Madonna) in a turn-of-the-century narrative, but after the initial shock, the fun is infectuous.<br />This is a movie ABOUT love . . . and it is a movie TO love.  I love it, and I hope you will too.  Valentine's Day is coming up, and Moulin Rouge has my vote for the best &quot;Valentine's Day&quot; choice this year. As I mentioned, Love is only Love when it is shared -- so be sure to share the experience of watching this film with someone you love.
B00000348D|5.0|I was walking Trixie down the lush green landscaping of Cally-Forn-I- Aye, when we came upon a streelight at a very busy intersection across the streeet from the Oreck headquarters with big palm trees that are lit from the bottom in a very strong and contrasty way. Anway, the light said walk and off we went listening to Ornett Coleman's frreee jazzz. It was the double quartet rockin' out with the two bass players solo-ing. It was so mellow and groovy at the same time. Then it happened! The light turned to &quot;Don't Walk&quot;, while we were only halfway across the street. I put my foot down to start to run and....Flam Bam Pow Pazzzang!!! The rest of the double quartet kicks in having a fit! and we're runnin and Ornette's Pizowing and bashing! Damn it was great. Y'know the brass section does alot heina-ish laughing on that album. That's the story anyway, gee.
B00005TT77|5.0|Well, that may seem like something of an exaggeration. But I'm predicting right now that when silly music magazines crank out their list of the best soundtracks every ten years or so, this will eventually crawl its way near the tops of those lists. <br />There's something just so instantly irresistible about having modern artists interpret Beatles songs. These kinds of albums are usually hit-and-miss affairs, but &quot;I Am Sam&quot; seems to have the bull's-eye pretty well mapped out. Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot; is a stellar highlight, reaching the soaring heights and poetic flight of the Beatles' version. Ben Harper, the Black Crowes, and Rufus Wainwright tweak their respective covers just enough to express their individual styles, but maintain respect for the originals. And though it still confuses me why the Stone Temple Pilots didn't add their recent &quot;Revolution&quot; single to this disc, I can't complain: trippy funk-masters Grandaddy handle the song with pure grace (though the result is significantly less charged than the original).<br />The movie itself looks to be a bit sentimental, but this soundtrack evokes sentiments in all the right ways: nostalgia (Chocolate Genius's dead-on working of &quot;Julia&quot;), passion (Aimee Manna and Michael Penn's duet &quot;Two of Us&quot;) and with George Harrison's passing still fresh in the public's mind, longing (Eddie Vedder's blissfully understated &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;). This album was a fantastic idea, and is a great addition to the collection of any serious Beatles fan.
B00005O5JV|4.0|The great thing about this movie is that it could have been total fluff but Reese Witherspoon takes moderate material and makes it work.  I never thought I would actually feel &quot;sorry&quot; for a beautiful blonde character.  The movie is really about stereotypes and self esteem.  Luke Wilson is easy on the eyes and brings a mature sensibility to the film playing the one man who takes Reese's character seriously.  Subplots involving those around Reese serve as comic relief.  Legally Blonde is the perfect date movie or girls night in flick and leaves you just feeling good about the world.  And in this day and age, who doesn't need that!  You'll laugh at your own prejudices about blondes.  Have fun!
B00003CXTF|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent.  Although it was much better on the big screen, I still enjoyed the video version.  The actual historical timeline was acurately followed, and the actual attack itself was by far the best part of the film.  I was happy to see that when the Arizona was hit, it was done correctly with the bomb penetrating the forward magazine instead of the myth of the bomb going down the smokestack.  Perhaps the best part of the movie was the capsizing of the Oklahoma.  I also enjoyed the Eagle Squadron scenes from England.  I didn't care too much for the romance side of the movie, but it is excellent for history and special effects buffs.
B00003CXC6|5.0|...I mostly wanted to add another viewer type that may enjoy the movie: students of history.<br />I first saw Rashomon in an upper-level history class required to graduate.  The reason for showing this particular movie makes sense when you think about it; the viewer and the court in the movie have to do exactly what historians do all the time.  An incident occurs - in this case, a murder.  When speaking to four different witness, you'll hear four different accounts.  (It's interesting, too, that even a dead man has his own view and not some omnipotent third-person perspective gained from his switch in planes of existence.)  Though this is pretty obvious when you think of criminal investigations, people rarely think of this when many, many years have passed.  We start to believe that anything written way-back-when is the gospel truth, but when you're lucky enough to find a record of an event, it will be tainted by the same points of view as are depicted in the movie.<br />My favorite case-in-point: watch the way the bandit and the man fight when described by one of them compared to the way the peasant sees it!  It's worth a giggle.
630339406X|4.0|Big-1988<BR>100mins/Colour<BR>Tom Hanks<BR>Elizabeth Perkins<BR>Robert Loggia<BR>John Heard<br />The wonderfully versatile Tom Hanks stars as Josh Baskin, a 12 year old boy who makes a wish on a carnival wishing machine. His wish is to be 'BIG'....and to his amazement wakes up the next morning with the body of a 30 year old. Confused and frightened at being thrust into the adult world, Josh (with the help of his best friend) runs away to New York, where by sheer luck he lands a job in a Toy company. There he discovers the advantages of being big: freedom,money,unlimited toys and junk food. But he's not prepared for what happens when he attracts sexy co-worker-chic, ambitious and predatory Susan Lawrence. Josh is torn between the freedom of being an adult (with a 12 year old brain)and the love and security of his homelife. BIG is great entertainment, it is often touching but always BIG on laughs!<BR>Written by coproducers Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg.Tom Hanks' 11th film. BIG was later a broadway musical.
1878424319|5.0|This is one of the best gifts I've ever given my children entering adulthood. It's short, caring, and a quick easy to read up lifting book. The writing explains to the reader to pay heed to your &quot;second attention&quot; which is the fact that you have what you need inside and to use it. Reading this book helps the reader to understand that none of us should take the reactions of other people so personally. The teachings here are so very basic and reading this book just basicly helps the reader understand life and tolerate it better. I highly recommend reading this little piece of knowledge and see how it will change the way you react to situations and feel more in control of your life. A small book with big returns for your spiritual future and outlook on life.
B00005R2BG|5.0|When I first sat down to watch this movie, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience. There are some parts of the movie that, at first viewing, don't work. The first part of the film, especially the first twenty minutes, are a blur of colors and people. However, the more I watched it, the more I liked it. The chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is fabulous, they're both great in their roles and they're awesome singers. All the supporting actors are great too, especially John Leguizamo, who is virtually unrecognizable in his role. The songs somehow fit in perfectly with the rest of the film and you'll be singing them long after the movie's over.<BR>I'm not normally a fan of musicals, but this movie is so addictive, it has become my favorite movie of all time. If there's any justice in the world, this movie will win for best actor/actress, best director, and best picture at the Oscars. My only regret is that I didn't see it in the theater.
B00003CXRP|1.0|Tom Hanks does a terrific job as the leading (and almost only) role. The story however, is one of the worst I had ever seen in a high budgeted movie. There are so many inconsistancies that it's completely stupid to be considered a work of possible non-fiction. And since the movie is based on the theory that it can happen to anyone, the inconsistencies totally ruin the film.<br />First of all, the undertow fro the plane sinking would have sucked him down the moment he crashed. Second, Why would anyone keep a picture of Helen Hunt in a cave with them as their symbol of hope? Third, if he HAD survived and been rescued, the moment he stepped onto land he would have been put in jail for opening all those fed ex packages that didn't belong to him! and finally...<br /> DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE THAT WENT THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH WOULD END UP LETTING A PLANE TAKE THEM HOME!? I would have demanded that they use the boat that rescued me take me straight to a limo that would have brought me to jail for opening mail that didn't belong to me!

B000002UYZ|5.0|To the &quot;music fan&quot; who gave this and the accompanying blue 1967-1970 compilation only 'one' star -- and trashes both because he/she thought they were a bad excuse for making a CD... I have one thing to say:  PLEASE read the release date!  It's quite apparent &amp; obvious, you were NOT around when the Beatles were still together, or when vinyl records were king.  These two wonderful, and ORIGINAL 'best of' compilations of the Beatles were originally released on vinyl back in 1973.  For those that didn't want to buy all their original albums, or CD's (later)... this is a terrific choice!  Especially if you had them on vinyl a long time ago.  To others listening... follow the advice of a 'true' music fan (who WAS around when the Beatles were together)... and when record companies could only fit so many songs on a vinyl disc.  These two compilations are truly classic!  I'm sure many would agree.

B00005NWM3|5.0|There hasn't been much to crow about in the world of modern metal. Bands such as Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park have turned angry metal into a joke, as the anger they flex sounds forced and ridiculous. Is there any salvation?<br />Enter Nickelback?<br />Nickelback has turned from obscure Vancouver band to kings of heavy metal, and for good reason. With singer Crad Kreuger telling all the stories of the dark side of life, such as domestic abuse , crime, and the collapse of relationships, particularly in one of the greatest songs of the year, How You Remind Me. However they do so with a sense of both compassion and intensity, instead of bombarding you with a sonic assault of distorted guitars and bad rapping. (Fred Durst are you listening?) In this way they're following in the footsteps of Staind, only with improved lyricism and instrumentation.<br />In conclusion if you were to buy just one album released in 2001 this would have to be it! In a metal world full of terrible musicians, Nickelback stands tall above the crowd. This is essential for every person who wants their rock and roll fan loud, passionate, and creative. Lets hope that Nickelback will be around for a long time.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie was hilarious. I am typically very difficult to entertain, and am not much into movies - but I decided to give &quot;Shrek&quot; a whirl. I actually avoided this movie at first because I thought it would be stupid. I was so pleasantly surprised. Here's a quick rundown of what I loved about &quot;Shrek&quot;<br />* Incredible graphics! I am a designer and I greatly appreciated the amazing attention to detail.<br />* It was hilarious! The comic bits were really funny...<br />* The characters were excellent... The graphics along with the voices for each character really made their personalities come across.<br />* It was a very, very sweet story.<br />Rent it, buy it - go see it! It's great!

6304493681|3.0|After waiting eagerly for this DVD to arrive, I was sorely disappointed to find that while there are menu choices for Japanese and Japanese with English subtitles, selecting any of these on my Sony DVP S330 results in nothing but the dubbed English track.  As english is nowhere near as nice to watch this in as Japanese, I'm thinking of returning it.  Aside from the language not sounding as nice, a problem is that the choices of voice actors for the english dubbing is very poor, as is common with much anime.  The original soiundtracks are done by professionals, whereas the translations are amateurish in comparison.
6305807043|3.0|It says much for this film that I was so engrossed by it as to forget about the argument I'd been having with a fellow movie-goer during the previews.  Cusack, living a life of utter misery (even his basement apartment is lit by greenish flourescent lights and populated by dogs, cats, birds and even a monkey), discovers at work a porthole leading directly to the brain of John Malkovich.  Soon Cusack and the smart and enterprising Keener are selling tickets to poor slobs who want to be Malkovich for 15 minutes--including Cusack himself and his frowsy, animal-loving wife, Diaz (&quot;We're getting a new shipment of kitty litter today!!!&quot;).  The movie  was funny, perverse, and just flat-out freaky.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen since....well...ever! The music is rich in spirit and the artwork is tremendous...ear and eye candy, topping it off with a rich plot. This, my friends, is a full course meal including appetizers and desserts. Absolutely amazing, really deserves to be on Disney Platinum. However, some news for you, the DVD's expected release is 2004, I have spoken to Disney Officials at the Mall of America in Minnesota.
0802136834|5.0|Follow me closely here, reader; I promise I will get to the point as quickly as I can. I acquired my first Alison Weir book by happy accident - anyone who has been a member of a book club may have shared this experience: you forget to return your stupid forms and the next thing you know, the &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; drops through your letterbox. What's this? A History Book? D'oh!... But, as time would tell, fate was delivering me a cheeky poke in the ribs - a marvellous life-changing experience, my first Alison Weir book, my first history book.<br />OK, I'm still getting to the point, but just a little more context: history as taught at my school. Old Mr Nicholson droning on about The Romans. Cheesy Mr Callan who made history seem as dry as eating sand for lunch in the desert.<br />Imagine my astonishment then, when upon opening Ms. Weir's marvellous book, I discover that history is quite different, full of life, real people, drama, colour, humour, tears, envy, triumph, greed, love, and all this in the first chapter!<br />That first book was actually The Princes in the Tower, but The Six Wives is the best of Alison's histories in my humble op. You may have noticed that I have finally got round to the point!<br />Weir has a miraculous talent for rounding out historical personages into real people; she does this entirely by using the facts, and she really applies her talents to their best when describing Henry's unfortunate spouses. We gasp with admiration at Katharine of Aragon's strength, and we gasp with shock at Anne Boleyn's bare-faced scheming. Poor Katharine Howard requires us to remember how daft we were when we were 16. Not as daft as her though.<br />The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth is a masterful combination of thorough research and sheer readability. 8 years ago Alison Weir unlocked a hidden passion for history in me which has become a major pleasure in my life.<br />Whether or not you are a history-lover, I command you! Read this book!
0446608955|5.0|I really liked this book, it was a good read, kind of short but it was exactly the type of book that I like - romantic and sweet and it also made me laugh.  However, it made me cry too.  Just like the prologue says, the book will make you laugh and cry.  I've never read anything by this author before but after reading this, I'm definately going to read more by Nicholas Sparks.  I'm not certain what to make of the ending though.  I liked it but .. I'm not sure that I interpreted it correctly.  Then again, I don't want to spoil the book for anyone.. so I'm not going to say anymore.  : )  I wonder if the movie will be any good.
0553213105|5.0|I loved the book! Jane Austen is truly a genius. I really don't know how she makes the book so interesting! I mean, the characters aren't throwing themselves at each other, and there aren't any viciuos fights or anything like that. In those times, everybody had to be calm and acceptible. But still the book is so captivating! You're just dying for Elizabeth (main character) to fall in love with Mr. Darcy! You really get into the book.<br />Now I've started to use words like handsome and agreeable in daily speech!!<br />But seriously, it's worth it.
B0000024RQ|4.0|But this is an amazing piece of work that's held up well with many worthy songs,even more remarkable given that he was only 21-22 when this album was released. It would easily be a 5-star effort,except that his &quot;singing&quot; for me is generally so bad that I can't hear one song more than once in a row, and it's even difficult to listen to the CD all the way thru. Starting with BLOWIN IN THE WIND,the most famous of all protesters, which was interesting in it's time,very dated today,and anyway recorded much better by Folkies who could sing (like Peter,Paul,Mary, etc).GIRL FROM N. COUNTRY very nice,if simple, song.MASTERS OF WAR still has some truth,though in today's world such as idea seems completely absurb (though it really isn't).Some of it's blood/death images are hard to take though (eg &quot;And I hope that you die...&quot;). HARD RAIN, a great tune based on an Irish folk ballad,written during the Cuban Missle Crisis of 1962,Bob's best song ever,another song whose message seems dated,but really is not. DON'T THINK TWICE, one of my personal guitar-playing favorites. CORRINA CORRINA,a nice folk-blues with unique guitar work,and Bob's singing here is actually almost good,even tender. I SHALL BE FREE simply among the funniest tunes ever, one that has provided me constant laughs for eons.The others show more humor,protest etc.,but are not really among the CD's best. This album is an easy 5-star based on song quality, but less based on listenability.
0385506244|5.0|Wow!!  I have been a Grisham fan for years, and in fact, picked up and put this book down several times in the bookstore.  I have been &quot;burned&quot; by buying a respected author's newest book, and then being disappointed--i.e. Jan Karon's latest ventures!!  However, Skipping Christmas made my heart soar!!  It is #1 on the best sellers list--so how can our Americans be wrong??  Yes, it's light hearted, Yes, it's whimsical, Yes, it's far-fetched--yet, after what we have endured as a country this past year, don't we all need a break from reality?  Do yourself a favor, sit back, put a fire in the fireplace, curl up with your favorite drink and this book, and feel the joy of the holidays!
B00005BCPC|1.0|This movie was such a dissapointment- so many geat aspects of the book were changed or left out.  Perhaps this is because they tried to squish such a wonderful and twisting plot into two hours.  I think If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have understood the movie, it jumps to quickly from scence to scene.
B000001ES9|5.0|I bought this first album by Rush when it came out way back 25 years ago.  It just totally kicked butt then and it still does to this day.  It is Rock'n'Roll at it's finest.  There is no \\"progressive rock\\" about it.  When they released their next two albums (after this one) I was so disappointed in them that I wrote to them to complain!  Believe it or not, they wrote me back.<br />They said that although their first album (entitled RUSH) was a rock and roll album, they felt that in order to sell more records they needed to change their music somewhat to reach a broader audience.  I like some of their newer stuff like Moving Pictures and Presto but they all still pale in comparison to this album.<br />So NOW HEAR THIS... if you have always thought Rush (the group) was OK but they just didn't play good enough Rock'n Roll for you, this is the album in which they did.  Buy it now and you'll have one of the 10 best rock albums ever produced... PERIOD. Trust me on this.<br />Just to let you know what other ablums I like: Aerosmith's first 2 albums kicked butt, Robin Trower's Bridge of Sigh's is great, The Best of Cream (with the live version of Crossroads on it) really rocks, Skynyrd's first album was excellent, Stevie Ray Vaughn was very good, and two of Jimmy Thackery & the Drivers albums: Wild Night Out (it's a live recording that totally rocks) and also Thackery's album Drive To Survive are must have albums for any true rock'n'roll music fan.  If you own those albums then you know what good rock'n roll is.  If you don't own'em, you don't know what you're missing!  (Especially Jimmy Thackery, he is the best kept secret of the last 25 years!)<br />Thank you and good day to you.  <br />Franco (A-Nye-alator) Nye
0679601945|5.0|The character of Fanny Price is so easy to fall in love with.  I recommend this book to everyone.  Jane Austen may be hard to read at first but once your in- your hooked....
0156012197|5.0|That The Little Prince appears on French currancy tells us how cherished this little guy is! The adventure takes us, children and adults into oneself...in an honest and magical way. This story is one of the frustration in childhood when we are inner creative biengs...trying hopelessly to communicate with adults. It's futile...until the adult brings their attention inward. I was only disappointed in the translation, for when a feminine pronoun was used in French, the male was used in Enaglish. Children, inner voyagers, and/or psychology buffs are bound to adore this story.
0679601910|5.0|This a beautiful story. If you've ever read Bridget Jone's diary- the edge of reason- it's a knock of of this classic.  Read it yourself and find out why Jane Austen is so inspiring
B00005R87Q|5.0|Geez...after I got my DVD player, this was the first DVD that I HAD to get!  It's my favorite DVD that I have and it is worth more than the... I paid for it...
067088278X|5.0|My 18 month old has loved this book for the past six months. The melody of the words makes reading out loud a pleasure. The detailed pictures allows every reading experience to be different by pointing to new things. This book is just the best!
B0000508U6|5.0|I am 40 years old, and primarily grew up (although some would say I have never 'grown up'!) in the 70's and 80's.  I have over 1450 CD's in my collection, and Coldplay's \\"Parachutes\\" without question rates in my top 20!  Just when I was complaining to my wife and freinds how most music these days ...[stinks], this one comes along to rekindle my faith in the current music scene!  Coldplay just 'paints sonic pictures' with their gorgeous guitar layered tapestries and lush interweave of percussion, vocals, and guitars!  Just when all the fruity boy bands (Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, 98 Degrees, etc.) and lousy Limp Bizkits of the world take over, Coldplay comes along and saves the day!
B00005R87Q|5.0|When I saw who was in it I wanted to see it just for the actors. But when I actually saw it, I decided it was deeper then the characters! Great Actors, Great cars, over all great movie!
0930289455|5.0|This story is actually more about the Joker than Batman, but so much the better for it.  It is more interested in WHO the Joker is and why he does what he does, rather than sensational fight scenes.  That having been said, the Joker does do some rather gruesome things in this book. We find a possible explanation of the Joker's past and his involvement with Batman.  This is great for anyone who's felt sympathy for the Joker and has rooted for him on occaision.  In this, we do see that Batman and the Joker really are opposite sides of the same coin.  They both exist because of the same thing: they each had &quot;a bad day.&quot;  Batman finally recognizes this, and tries to break them out of the &quot;duel to the death&quot; that they are both locked into.  For me, the best part of the book happens when the two main characters call a time-out, put all the B.S. aside, and really TALK to each other.<br />This is a very short novel, but having read it, it seems to have exerted as much influence over the movie Batman as The Dark Knight Returns.
1577312082|5.0|I truly wish I could afford to ship this book to everyone in the entire world.  Eckhart's words speak the truth about life, love and true inner peace.  Over the past few years I suffered the loss of several close dear friends and most recently my Father. I felt disillusioned with God, life, love and the human race in general.  This wonderful book has renewed my spirit, has given me inner peace and has filled my heart with pure joy.  To quote myself, &quot;I feel as though I have come back from a 3 year hiatus from life.&quot;  Buy this book...you will NOT be disappointed.<BR>Eckhart...if you read this...I wish you many blessings and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
0446677450|1.0|This was just another way for him to be rich and us out of 14 bucks. Everybook has a bit to offer and give you idea's. His book just repeats itself, and his life story's condridict themseleves. <br />He keeps talking about how to be rich, but he doesnt state what he did. Hes' really vague about what he did to make money. he states he likes to buy books and get ideas and formula's to make money. And his book offer NONE....The whole thing is we are part of one of his other formulas to make money..<br />I think the best books are people who truly write to contribute their knowledge, but not thinking about typing something up and seeing if they can make it big...as this book does...if your skeptical buy it, read it, then return it.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Let me tell you from the start.  This movie is worthy of a C.  This movie was not scary at all!  This Francis Ford Coppola executive produced movie is a one and a half hour full of pretty good entertainment, if you don't expect much from horror movies.  I rented this movie yesterday and I actually thought it was funny.  The dialogue is laughable, and the plot is so predictable, but I guess it was what I expected from a horror movie.  If you buy this, you will be disappointed.  This is worth a rental to pass the time.  And it is kind of amusing.  But don't go into this movie expecting a lot of scares.  Sure, there is a considerable amount of violence, but it is not scary.  The movie has a good amount of suspense, and it was different from most horror flicks.  The killer was a monster.  Sort of bat-like.  I won't tell you the ending, but don't expect some wonderful ending. If you want a really good horror movie, buy Halloween.  If you want a horror movie because you are bored on the weekend, rent this movie for a few laughs.
B000002LMM|5.0|Let us, for a moment, take the mediocre television series of the same title out of the picture when mentioning this soundtrack. I say this because it is a wonderous tale of musical genius that is over far sooner than it should be and leaves a permanent, far more significant impression than the TV show ever could. First off, I am more than in favor of a director of film who lives and dies by the same composer, regardless of the movie (or in this case, show) he/she is crafting. Music and film can be like the perfect marriage and when a specific director and composer are on the same page with a formula that works, there is no conceiveable reason for the two to break company. Look at Steven Spielberg and John Williams. Similar in relationship but vastly different in narrative scope are David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti. My first experience with Badalamenti's work was the soundtrack for another Lynch film entitled, Lost Highway. It was a good soundtrack, but mixed with Trent Reznor's implausible vision and a handful of Marilyn Manson B-sides, it was like a nightmare machine of parts that didn't function properly. Being a Lynch fan, I purchased his next film's soundtrack, which came from The Straight Story. It is and will always be on of my favorite musical possessions. The music was triumphant and powerful at the same time it was sweet and sincere. Listening to it made me feel like I was immersed in world of complete warmth and tranquility. Lynch intended for the Straight Story to be a calm, freshly innovative new approach for him as a director and the music that spawed from this departure was nothing short of ethereal. It wasn't long after that I purchased the soundtrack to Twin Peaks and it brought me back to where I was with the Straight Story music, but not in the same fashion. With the Straight Story, I felt completely sober in a world that only existed in peace and generosity, like a pseudo-utopia if you will. But with Twin Peaks it was like I returned to that peaceful realm only to find that it was shrouded in gray clouds and delivered more of wintery chill. Intoxicated, I also found a girl in a red dress waiting for me and I knew she loved me, but all the same I was apprehensive about her companionship. I felt as though I could not trust her. I guess that plays in more with the Twin Peaks atmosphere, in as much as you're dealing with an entire TV series based on a town where no one can be trusted. The music conveys that notion beautifully. Again, my whole perfect-director-composer-marriage thing. But I do recommend picking up this CD, whether you're a fan of the series or not. But listen to the Straight Story first and maybe Lost Highway. Then pop this in your CD player and see where it takes you.
0679805273|5.0|When I was a little girl, I thought Dr. Suess was Hop on Pop, Green Eggs and Ham, the Grinch, and Horton Hears a Who.  I had no idea that he was so prolific, nor did I know he wrote books with political and ideological messages.  So I was bowled over when I discovered this timeless classic, and then wondered why it hadn't been required reading somewhere along the line.<br />The message - an exciting world of possibilities just waiting for you to make your mark on them, tempered with the warning that obstacles will happen - is great for kids, but probably even more poignant for adults, young and old, who are on their way and may have encountered &quot;the waiting place&quot; or other such snares.  Couple an inspiring message with Dr. Suess' colorful rhythm and rhyme, and you have a book that is far more readable, and certainly more memorable than the corporate megalith, Who Moved My Cheese.<br />If I had my way, this book would be required reading for every high school senior, about to enter the world (and maybe for all those corporate mice stuck in the &quot;waiting place&quot; looking for their cheese).
B0000042MY|5.0|This is a masterpiece. There is not a bad song on this cd. This cd gives you goosebumps because it is that powerful. I listen to this cd every might before I go to bed. My favorite tracks would be &quot;Cora&quot;, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, and Main title. do yourself a favor and buy this!
B00003CXMG|5.0|Set in the early seventies and the time of endlessly touring British and American concept rock bands and told through the eyes of high school kid and wannabe rock journalist William Miller, the movie follows the lives of the up-and-coming fictionalised rock band Stillwater and one of their most special fans, Miss Penny Lane (the excellent Kate Hudson). Whether you were around in the seventies and remember this era (I wasn't and I don't) it is hard not to be moved be this rock odyssey as the band move from town to town, squabble to squabble and we watch William grow.<br />This has everything you'd expect from a movie about a rock band, girls, drink, drugs, fighting and general excessive bad behaviour but it skilfully avoids ever falling into clich&eacute; because the characters here are not just rock stars or groupies, they are real people, with human weaknesses and human strengths. Crowe's writing and direction are both subtle and beguiling and he draws extraordinary performances out of all the main leads including Billy Crudup (as lead guitarist and charismatic star of Stillwater), Kate Hudson (as Penny Lane), young Patrick Fugit (as William) and great supporting turns from the finest young character alive at this moment, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as legendary rock journo. Lester Bangs) and Frances McDormand, as William's overprotective mother.<br />I must admit to being a big fan of Cameron Crowe's work ever since seeing Say Anything and Jerry Maguire and unlike the, by all accounts, very disappointing Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous is up there with Crowe's finest work. Great romance, great humour and great warmth, this semi-autobiographical movie has it all in bucket loads and if this doesn't warm the cockles of your heart their aint much hope left for you I'm afraid.
B00005U122|5.0|I was so amazed when I odund out that &quot;In the Flesh&quot; DVD would be released! I have preordered my item on Nov 16, 2001 - and here it comes. The sound is so wonderful and Roger is in his top form. That's the Tower of Strength! When I was watching the live show I saw the little bird was kicked off by the sound waves to the stage, but later successfully flew off - the very similar powerful sound you will get on this DVD! Absolutely 5 stars! The best live show I have ever seen!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|If you are a Man you must Love this movie, Its got the three things essential to life, Cars, Women and Money. Great Extras,  So when your done with the movie all you gotta do is watch the making with more cars and even hotter women.  <br />BEST MOVIE EVER!!  EVER?  EVER!!!
B00005OWEG|3.0|I borrowed Apocalypse Now Redux from a friend when I finally got a DVD player of my own. I love this movie, and thought I'd check out this version before I bought it for my collection. Whether you liked them or not, the added scenes are interesting, though the music and sound quality in some of them is just terrible. This is understandable, since they might not have had any music associated with those scenes before they were cut. The new scenes were marked in the scene-selection menu, which is nice.<BR>What I can't understand is WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS? This DVD has nothing. Just the film.<BR>Apocalypse Now is a great movie. It's definitely a good one to own on DVD, as it's visuals are outstanding. But I can't recommend this version unless it's about the same price as the standard edition or you're just dying to see the deleted scenes. Maybe Paramount will release a &quot;special&quot; or &quot;collector's&quot; edition that has EXTRAS? Like maybe with both versions and the making-of documentary? Is that a crazy idea? Redux gets 3 stars, for being a poor release of a great movie.
B00005M08C|3.0|Definately not a bad CD, but just wasnt quite what I was hoping for.  The only songs worth listening to are the singles, which can be listened to for free (minus about 30 seconds to a minute of the song) on their website (...).  Wish I had bought a different album.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Michael Bay may some day make a movie for adults, instead of these live-action cartoons, but not today!  I wonder if he ever bothers to read the cruddy dialogue in his scripts or is he too swamped in the logistics of his set-piece blow-em-up action scenes.  Does the 2nd unit shoot the rest of the flick?<br />Anyway, the Pearl Harbor attack and the raid on Tokyo are doozies!  Really fabulous movie magic action and worth seeing!  Since that is about 30 minutes of this near 3 hour turkey, you gotta a lot of dumb characters played broadly, trite dialogue, and boring love story to sit through.  About the depth of a Sgt. Rock comic book.  The performances across the board aren't worth talking about, so I won't.  The photography is pretty.<br />I wish  Bay &amp; Bruckheimer would play fair and create a DVD of just the airfight over England, the Pearl Harbor attack, and the Tokyo raid.  About 30-40 minutes and sell it for $5 bucks.  Now that would be just treatment of the audience and give you about what is worthwhile for about the right price.<br />Since a little over 1/4 of the movie is the only thing worth seeing, that is the only reason it even gets 2 stars.
6305511055|5.0|What is it about this movie that makes it so compelling?  After countless viewings, I still can't put my finger on it -- but let's consider the crucial elements of &quot;Condor.&quot;<br />First, the paucity of dialogue -- in other words, what Redford displays and emotes rather than says -- is powerful.  It seems that for the first time in his career, Redford is really challenged to act instead of being just another pretty cinematic face.  If ever a man could give the impression of being both haunted and hunted, Redford's a cinch in &quot;Condor.&quot;<br />This is also a great New York City film.  Its streets, back alleys, and buildings -- in particular, the World Trade Center -- all play supporting roles.  Sidney Pollack makes good use of the then-newly finished twin towers in &quot;Condor,&quot; and this viewer lamented their destruction after watching scenes featuring the main lobby and a top-floor office inhabited by CIA deputy director Cliff Robertson.<br />The grainy quality of the film, matched with an often funky, sometimes melancholy soundtrack scored by Dave Grusin, also adds to the aura of &quot;Condor.&quot;  It's as if Pollack attempted to do an American sendup of a French intrigue film.  Grusin's music also is not what you'd expect in a spy film, in that it has not a hint of the James Bond sound.  Then again, the film is not a romantic spy thriller, so it works.<br />In fact, Pollack and Redford successfuly convey a post-Watergate paranoia that the citizens' government is 'out there' and will stop at nothing to hunt down the truth-seeking rogue.  Phone taps and plumbers (disguised, this time, as mailmen) abound.  Suitably, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; ends with a very anti-establishment message.<br />This film deserves to be placed in the list of top twenty great American films of the modern cinematic era (however one judges that).  &quot;Condor&quot; is good the first time around and seems to be more enjoyable with subsequent viewings.  Far from being a period piece, it stands the test of time as a thriller that is also thoughtful.
B00005TT77|5.0|I heard a couple of songs on the radio (Eddie Vedder's version of You've Got to Hide Your Love Away and Aimee Mann/ Michael Penn's rendition of Two of Us). I love the diverse list of musicians assembled to put their personal spin on Beatles classics. From my first listen, it's clear that bands put a lot into their efforts. I highly recommend this...
B0000004V2|5.0|I first heard of the Stone Roses in 1992.  My roomate had a Stone Roses CD and I put it in and played one song one time and then pulled it out.  I just did not give it a chance.  When he moved out in 1995 he left the CD, but I never bothered to play it and pretty much forgot about it.  The next time I stumbled across the Stone Roses was on this site.  The reviews sounded to good to be true.  So on the way home from work I bought this CD figuring the Stone Roses CD my roomate left me must have been their not so good second album.  Only when I got home did I realize that it was the same one.  This time I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.  I have over 100 CD's in my collection and it seems like out of all of my choices, I keep picking this one to listen to.  I can't believe I have had this CD for so long and ignored such a great piece of work.  Now have have two of them.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I seriously think that this is by far her best album! She's done an *NSYNCer move and totally moved away from the ballads. More songs on this album have an electronic/bass presence which makes it more easier and more pleasent to listen to.<BR>I will be the first one to admit that although her previous albums were good, they didn't last for more than 5 minutes on my CD player (and I'm a BIG Britney fan!).<BR>&quot;I'm a slave for you&quot; has definitely sealed Britney's ability to take risks especially within her targeted &quot;pre-pubescent&quot; market and succeed. <BR>My personal faves would have to be &quot;Overprotected&quot; (I just love the message behind this...&quot;I need time,joy, I need space, love, I need ME!&quot;). &quot;Boys&quot; has that right mix between sultry and innocence. The wicked beat is simple but effective. The singing, may not be much, but it fits the type of song it wants to achieve. &quot;Anticipating&quot; reminds me of Kylie Minogue's &quot;Locomotion-ish&quot; songs. It's fun, it gets you on the dancefloor and it makes you think about the last time you wore a pair of bell bottoms!! &quot;Cinderella&quot; just like the fairytale, the outcome of this song is magic. Although most pop songs are formulated around the same melodic ostinato patterns, and will usully result in banal creations, this song definitely does not follow!. &quot;Bomabastic Love&quot; is a return of Britney's old stuff, along the lines of &quot;Baby one more time...&quot;. A nice inclusion. It mixes well with the rest of the songs on the album. Mentions also need to be made about &quot;That's where you take me&quot; and &quot;What it's like to be me!&quot;. I seriously think that 10 out of the 14 songs have the potential to be commercially released.<BR>Great Job Britney!
6302878527|5.0|The cinematography is amazing for its' time. The screenplay is amusing. As in other Hepburn vehicle's love tends to play a major role, but it is the question of cynicism in regards to love and all that it entails which makes the picture something to watch. Love is never perfect of course, but for all its' ups and downs it's a wonderful place to be in when truly fealt.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I gave this a listen before buying it, the songs were catchy right away and I have to say, they just keep growing on me more and more!  I love this cd from start to finish.  Each song is creative and &quot;unique in it's own way&quot;.  Personally, whoever feels that the songs all sound alike, I completely disagree.  It's like saying rock is rock.  It's just a different sound for No Doubt, but each song is completely different and very unique.  Though I love the whole album, my personal fav is Hella Good.  Just a feel good, get up and dance and love life kind of tune!  Give this cd an unbiased ear and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This really is great stuff.
B00005R87Q|3.0|The movie was full of high speed action, the plot was so-so and the acting was horrendous. Probably a product of targeting only the cool, sexy young actors. <br />Nevertheless, this movie introduced us to the growing popularity of the street racing scene and was very shallowy entertaining (3 stars).
0395925037|5.0|I first read this book when I was thirteen, and I have to say even at that age I thought it a brilliant work.  As far as I have experienced, dictated books don't work to well, and although this sounds more like a long speech it actually works well as a book too.  Even behind the philosophy there is something which is interesting if people took the time to think about it.  It is a complicated mixture of autobiograhical study and theological rhetorics but if Hitler had not been so despised by the world, he would have been the next Nietzche.<BR
0060278234|5.0|It was a case of good news/ bad news when I completed Lirael. I began to notice that the number of pages ahead surely where not enough to cover the breadth of the novel's many twisting plots. I was ba' humbug for a moment after finishing but this is only because &quot;I WANTED MORE&quot;. I would have read another 700 pages if they were there for me to read, but at the same time I was excited and pleased to know that I had at least one more great book to look forward to. <BR>I read Sabriel about two years earlier and then went on to read all of Nix's other books. Shade's Children is still one of the most creepy and uncannily realistic (in tone and feel, of course) books that I have ever read. I have read 1000+ books and still have most of them and I am 22 at the moment. I worked at a chain bookstore for a year and a half to help fill all of the available wall space in my apartment. I would have to say that Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy is at the moment my favorite fantastical story, well over HP although I really did enjoy them all. But what was started in Sabriel is giving rise to a literary universe that is just as visceral and just as balanced as any that Rowling, Pullman or Alexander could conceive of. Indeed, the featured reviews printed on the dust cover where from just such authors and represent a big statement, at least in my eyes. <BR> In Sabriel, we where introduced to the title character and her adventures in the Old Kingdom. Sabriel is one of those characters that slices deep into your mind like a white-hot wire. Reading about her quest to free the dead from there unnatural service to evil necromancers was at all times like watching an artistically directed horror movie boasting a highly professional cast of method actors and actresses. It took only a small number of pages before as a reader I was committed to following her tale to its completion. And I longed for the tale to continue. It was a novel that screamed with potential for a sequel. Everything involved in the story was universal; any reader around age 12 or up will automatically identify with the characters that populated the story. The themes are almost just as universal. As a general rule most people have at least some amount of passive interest in the mysteries of death, it is inevitable. It is human. So to read a tale of a young woman who picks up the seven forbidden bells of the necromancer and has to fulfill the role of the Abhorsen (a decidedly `good' necromancer who uses the bells to send back the undead rather than conjure them and to bind and stop anyone who would use the bells for evil designs) is like watching someone we all know step in and fill shoes dauntingly large with largess and bravado. The novel is a self-sufficient tale of Sabriel's memorable journey. I can't imagine anyone finishing the book and not yearning for a sequel. I always did and perhaps this is why I so eagerly set out to acquire all of Garth Nix's previous works. However, none of them shared that particular universe I came to love.<BR> Lirael was an unexpected boon. I went into a bookstore looking for something or anything to read and after awhile wander aimlessly into the young adult section to see if Nix or Pullman had anything new. I can't tell you how pleased I was to see a hardback on the top shelf with the words Lirael and Nix written along the spine. Of course, I knew what it was immediately. The similarities in the two names Sabriel and Lirael were obvious. I hurried to checkout and went home to read it. My fianc was having her wisdom teeth pulled the next day so I forced myself to put the book down after two or so chapters so I could read it while I waited. I read more than half the book while I waited the next day, seated on the concrete outside drinking a Coke and smoking cigarettes. I would finish the rest when I got home later that afternoon. Once I started nothing seemed nearly as appealing as crawling into a comfortable chair and finishing the bookI had begun. It was brilliant and I can already tell it will end in an incendiary climax that will be the culmination of Nix's sizeable talent. I have that much faith in him at this point. It is not unfounded either. Just from the tale he has crafted here it is obvious that he knows Lirael's path.<BR> I do not want to say much about the actual plot; you can read published reviews or the dust jacket to this effect. But I will say, the Disreputable Dog makes a brilliantly charming companion to Lirael through the course of her explorations and departures. Romance enters the story and takes a delightfully unexpected twist and the good vs. evil struggle promises to be easily epic in both scope and accomplishment. So to end with a standard line, if you dug Sabriel, the Golden Compass, Harry Potter, or the Lord of the Rings there is no way you would have anything but praise for this novel.
B00000JMQE|5.0|Return to Oz is and always will be my all time favorite movie. It is a pity that people around the world have failed to embrace this wonderful story. I saw this movie for the first time about 14 years ago and was totally blown away by the visuals and story. This movie combines the books The Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz into one story, featuring Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Gump, and Billina the chicken, as well as the original characters. The reason people dismissed this beautiful movie was because it was not a Judy Garland, musical, technicolor marvel like the original they grew up with. It is clear that the film makers wanted to stay true to L. Frank Baums books, and not just make a sequel to the original. When I read the books as a kid, this is how I imagined Oz would be. The characters are believable and not just a guys in face paint. <BR>This movie could be so huge if people would have just given it a chance. I can only dream how cool it would be if they made sequels to this based on the other books. The cast is great, the music is beautiful, the visuals are amazing, and I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.
B00005R2BG|5.0|I was skeptical about this video given the mixed reviews in the theater.  However, I was completely won over by the video.  In a day of such little originality in movies, this is a breath of fresh air.  I loved this movie--Jim Broadbent's turn as the owner of Moulin Rouge, Nicole  Kidman's very good performance  and especially Ewan McGregor's singing.  Your Song is a high point for the movie.  Overall, a very surprised high thumbs-up.
B000002UD1|4.0|Mind Games is an album seeing Lennon return to his rock/pop roots while maintaining his beliefs in politics, spirituality and love. For me this album fuses many of the important elements in his previous albums (Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Sometime in New York.) The first track is ofcourse Mind Games which (if you are a Lennon solo fan) most people have heard of. Lennon was known for procrastination and leaving many elements out of songs. Mind Games left out many guitar parts and cut out many other forms of instrumentation as well. Yet we are left with an song that is clean, somewhat repetitive and sweet. The next song Tight As, is an example of Lennon's ability to break into an amazing jam session and pull off a decent track. While Tight As is at times dragging it maintains a rocking beat with humourous lyrics. Aisumasen (I'm Sorry) is a song that had me questioning why he had to include his wife's name. After reading several books and articles on Lennon I feel that if he had not displayed his wife quite as much he might have had more commercial success in the States. Aisumasen does maintain a tender love ballad and is reminiscent of his work on Plastic Ono Band. One Day (at a time) seems to be weak, however after several listens I determined that if you give the song a chance its not so bad after all. The song does show Lennon being a man far ahead of his time, the song probably was vital in being one of the songs that shaped the music of the 1980's. Bring on the Lucie (Freda Peeple) for me is the most powerful song on this entire album. I am suprised that it was not included on the John Lennon Collection. The rest of the songs seem to be fillers with the exception of I know and Out of the Blue (which could have been dusted off material from Imagine.) All in all this album is one that has been sorely over-looked by the public. Perhaps if Phil Spector had produced the album it might have been a bit cleaner or more of a commercial success. I think this album demonstrates that Lennon was a complete indivudal and a brillant singer/songwriter.

The reality of the situation is not so tempting. $458 a month hardly makes up for your husband dying on your wedding night.

Doreen wants to toss Judy right back into the arms of her parents. However, when Judy's father tells her she is not intelligent enough to make her own decisions, something changes. Private Benjamin decides to stay.<br /><br />Some of the great comic moments are when Goldie is cleaning the bathroom with her electric toothbrush. I have stayed at an army base in Germany and trust me, they could have used a bit of toothbrush cleaning. My thoughts were that in the army, everything was spotless. Not! So, this movie was even funnier since I could totally relate to some of the experiences Judy had to go through. Another reason to respect our men and women in the military!<br /><br />While this is mostly a comedy, there is some romance, with a sadistic twist. You know there is going to be trouble when Judy asks: \\"Am I making sense?\\" And her French Fianc' says: \\"No, and that `s what I love about you.\\" You start to get the feeling that Judy is the only one who really knows what she wants and that no one else is listening.<br /><br />Judy starts off running from her problems and ends up running from her problems.

B00003CXTG|1.0|1. This Movie is Split across TWO DVD's ( Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad!!!!)<BR>1a. If Paramount could squeeze Titanic on 1 disc in 1998, Touchstone can do it in 2001, so what am I missing here.<BR>2. Oh, word to Micheal Bay, kick your casting agent, because you don't score any brownie points for signing up Private Ryan B-strings (Tom Sizemore.) I heard Touchstone is putting him in yet another war movie (Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down) WITH JOSH HARTNETT!!)<BR>Is hollywood that hard up for actors that will weather boot?<BR>3. For everybody that keeps whining about how hard critics are, remember this: It could be a relative of yours up on that screen, and would you want to see that much saccharine coming out of thier mouths when you heard they were going to be in a respectable, intelligent war movie? Your answer betrays your character.<BR>4. As far as romance injected into history, I will defend TITANIC to the death. Kate and Leo had chemistry to spare, and the dialogue was very convincing, though anachronistic. It struck a deliberate middle ground between soap and high art.<BR>5. TITANIC had the decency to be 95% accurate. Some arguments will never be settled on that boat, but as far as Dec 7 was concerned, there is too much interesting documentation to allow equal amounts of cinematic non-sense. Why did the Japanese hate us? I don't think you get it out of this movie, or its extras.<BR>6. The most appealling thing connected to this movie was the teaser trailer with the Martin Sheen voice/over. Somehow, since the studio must have wanted to be consistant, they completely filched on us and left it out of the Trailers section.<BR>Thanks a lot!!
0790738139|4.0|This is an excelent, intrigueing movie,its only weakness being the length (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5).It captivates you, &amp; holds your interest from the jail riot in the begining to the ( what did you expect ) shoot-out climax.It has a twist of an ending, linking several characters you wouldn't expect.Some may have to watch it more than once to get the whole picture.A word of advice: Start the film no later than 9:00pm, it is along film ( much like waiting for a long time in a line for the new ride, that after you have ridden it you know the wait was worth it ).Some people complain about the violence &amp; profanity which is minimal &amp; should be over-looked because it is such a wonderful film. The violence &amp; profanity is minimal compared to, Casino (another must-see film,under-rated at the Oscars), for instance( think the &quot;field beeting&quot; scene,the &quot;hand-breaking&quot; scene).If your kids ( the inevitable hazard for an adult to enjoy a movie ) hav never seen &quot;The Sopranoes&quot; ( or any other HBO program for that matter ), or late night tv, you may think twice about letting children under 12 see this film.( I chose not to bring up plot points, they're already in the other reviews )( by the way,Guy Pearce should have won best  actor )This is a fantasticly enjoyable film, anyone who is a film fan should see this one ASAP
B00005TT77|4.0|Target audience: mellow Beatles fans, but accessible to all.  For whenever you need good succoring--or just background music for the day--this CD is contains nice interpretations of Beatles classics we all know by heart.  Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and Eddie Vedder's &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; are (so far) the standout tracks.

B00000J7JO|5.0|great cd ... but kinda bad production .... weird scratchy noises on the disc .. or is it just me
B000001IQH|5.0|it is so awsome. just the rancid vocals, along with rancid instruments......making this my favorite cd of all times. it's hard to beat any song by rancid. my personal favorite is Time Bomb. if you like that song, you will absolutely love this cd!
B0000508U6|5.0|Thank God for the Christmas money that i spent on this Cd because it was very well spent.  I had always liked the song &quot;Yellow&quot; but never really considered buying the CD until i had heard the hype about it being one of the best CD's of the year.  Then &quot;Trouble&quot; came out and that song was well enough a reason to buy it.  Something about that song truly makes you feel some intense emotions about mistakes you've made in the past.  <br />The first thing I really noticed after listening to the whole cd through was that I was hooked from the first listen.  That doesn't happen much.   <br />I didn't think i would have a negative comment to say about the cd, but i was a little dissapointed that what seemed to be my most favorite songs were nothing but a tease because they were so short, for instance track track 1, 7, and the little ghost song after track 10.  7 and 10 have incredible potential to be these awesome songs, and they are pretty much just soundbytes.  I mean this comment to be a compliment though, even though it sounds silly.<br />BUt overall, COldplay is an incredible band and they have so much potential for the future.  I know i will surely be an avid buyer of their next cds to come. By the way, if you like the band Travis, you will love Coldplay.  They are very similar in many ways. But, just buy the CD anyway; its some great music.
0449002632|2.0|I found the book to be very slow moving.  It seems that Rutherfurd committed to historical accuracy at the expense of attention-keeping activity.  While most chapters finished in an interesting fashion, it felt a labor to get there.  I must admit that at times I found the book informative on various points of London's history, overall it is not an easy read.
B00003CXTG|1.0|As a history and WWII movie buff, I was so completely dissappointed in this pathetic attempt to tell the Pearl Harbor story. The only people that will truly enjoy this movie are those that think special effects are what make a movie good. There were excellant visuals in the bombing scenes but that was only part of what this movie was supposed to be about. <br />The character development was terrible. Cuba Gooding had no actual role in this film and it does a great injustice to the man that actually lived that role. It almost seemed an afterthought to have his character in the movie at all. Secondly, the whole love story really took away from what the movie was intended to be about, namely a tribute to the men and women that died at Pearl Harbor. There are very few facts in this story, with the important history lessons glazed over very rapidly. <br />The director of this movie relies solely on visual effects to carry it, and then adds this horrible, and completely unbelievable love story, to bring it an audience that would normally not be interested in a typical war flick. Imagine if Charlie Sheen had fallen in love in the jungles of Vietnam during Platoon......To make the whole love story worse is that is is so completely cheesy, my wife and I had the plot and ending figured out within 15 minutes of the start of the movie. This movie was a complete sell out for money and he did a disservice to the men and women that paid a price defending this country.
B00003CXPD|4.0|I found this movie to be uplifting in almost all senses of the word. The performances are outstanding, particularly from Julie Walters (but then, what else would you expect from her?). There were two things in the movie that made me rate it 4 Stars rather than 5: 1) Why wasn't Julie Walters in the final scene? I felt that I needed that sense of closure and 2) While the scene in which the father returns to the mines to work and the strikers are going crazy screaming &amp; taunting the scabs, was indeed shocking &amp; disturbing in its realism, I did not understand one thing. Why, if there were hundreds of policeman protecting the returning workers, was it so very easy for the son to get to the father, once he was inside the compound, to confront him about returning to work? If it were so easy for any of the strikers to reach the main compound area, then why had they not done so before to get to the workers who refused to strike? Why were there not policeman protecting the workers there as well?<br />But, those two points aside, I have watched &amp; enjoyed this movie repeatedly due to its sincerity, levity, and uplifting quality.
B00005QDW5|4.0|At long last, Pink Floyd have released a best-of compilation, and for the most part, it's an excellent collection of timeless music, but it periodically gets bogged down in a couple of instances of Roger Waters' self-indulgence and the post-Waters Floyd's bloated, easy-listening tripe. Suitably, Echoes serves up 2 /12 hours of tunes, allowing for a fair look at each stage of the band's long career, and many of the great songs are there: Syd Barrett's great 'Astronomy Domine' and 'Bike', the epics 'Echoes' and 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', and the requisite songs from Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall that remain classic rock radio staples...there's so much great music on Echoes that you can't really complain, but when you take a step back and look at what was not included and what was, you have to wonder what both warring factions (Waters versus Everyone Else) were thinking.<br />There's no 'Careful With That Axe, Eugene', no 'Welcome To The Machine', no 'Brain Damage', no 'Run Like Hell', no 'Mother', and in their places are two mopey Waters songs from The Final Cut and The Wall movie (why not something from Live At Pompeii instead of the Alan Parker film?), and most heinously, five songs from A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and The Division Bell, songs that are so muddled in slick overproduction and overwraught, lazy, phony FM radio sentiment that they sound more dated than even Barrett's hippy-dippy 'See Emily Play'. To make things worse, they picked the wrong songs from that dark period, overlooking 1987's 'On The Turning Away', which is a hidden gem. If all seven songs (okay, 'Learning To Fly' is half decent) had been replaced with more quality fare, Echoes would have been spectacular. But hey, an album with 75% great Pink Floyd songs is still worth buying, and is a suitable introduction for new listeners. Just skip past the garbage.
B00004Z459|4.0|If your interested in some good workout music go ahead and buy this one.  I'm 31 so I'm not as young as the group of people that listen to LP but I enjoy it.  You can listen to every song and can't really pick a favorite.  This music really pumps me up and helps me get through my workout.  I appreciate that there is no foul language, the lyrics are a little depressing but considering today's music it seems you can't listen to a decent tune without hearing the &quot;F&quot; word every other word.  If you enjoy POD you'll enjoy this CD.  I think these guys will be around a while, I'm anticipating there next CD.
0375431624|4.0|This is a short little book.  I finished it in a few hours.  I think everybody that has had to slog through the stress of holiday shopping, cooking, etc. will be able to relate to this book.  It says a LOT about life in suburbia and about all the meaningless junk we've piled on to the season.  This book doesn't stack up to his classic legal thrillers, but then it wasn't meant to.  Grisham meant it to be a nice little holiday story, and that's just what it is.  This will undoubtedly show up as a tv movie some holiday season.  Highly recommended.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Make Yourself was and is the best album out there even today. drive is still on the charts WITH  wish you were here. i was a bit hesitant in buying this i really didn't want to be dissapointed, i mean how can you follow up an album like make yourself? when your at the top the only way to go is down. They didn't go down they went sideways, exploring new things and making themselves not only known for ear busting tunes but also great music all in all. <BR>If anyone has been following incubus through the years they know that incubus doesn't reinvent themselves they just add on. they are still rocking the same kind of songs they put out with fungous among us and s.c.i.e.n.c.e., but i think they were tired of being only know as a &quot;rock&quot; band. and being put in the same genre as other bands that had no talent compared to them. they opened themselves up and hoped for the better, i would think they felt a bit like putting their hearts on the line for something they believed in. they did a great job!! they are going to be criticised by people who think they went soft but i'm not one of them. this is a great album, no match for make yourself but close enough for it to be in my top 2 best albums for 2001 AND 2002!!!!<BR>Brandon Boyd is still writing great lyrics on this album. he will always be known for his lyrics they will live on.

In the spectrum of New York underground sound, it is more like a pop version of Television than the Velvet Underground--but even that doesn't do it justice. The sound is intense, driven and full of hooks without every working up a sweat, the lyrics are at turns flippant, cynical, romantic, surprising. Screw the hype--this is a great debut. I haven't been this excited about a young band since Nirvana.
076790382X|5.0|&quot;Oh, what the heck?  I liked 'A Walk in the Woods,' so let's see if this is any good.&quot;<br />That was my line of thinking as I checked out this book from my local library.  On the way home, I opened the cover (akin to opening a bag of my favorite chips) and sampled a bite.  And another.  Soon, I was eight chapters into the thing, wiping tears from my eyes to the amusement of my wife and children.  Then, the ultimate test: I read a page out loud to my wife.  Now I'm not intimating that she has any laughter inhibitions--she'll laugh up a storm within the first minutes of a good comedy flick--but to subject her to oral readings is to watch her mood take a serious downswing.  Must be the expectation levels I project.  (&quot;Come on, honey, don't you get it?  Are you listening?&quot;)<br />Test results: A+<br />Next thing I knew, I was fighting my wife for moments to gobble down another chapter or two.  No kidding.  Bill Bryson, in his inimitable manner, adds punch and humor to subjects normally as tastless as...well, as week-old chips.  He pinpoints the lunacies in our daily routine, the frustrations of red-tape, and the nostalgia of yesteryear.  He makes me wonder why we Americans behave in such ways, then leaves me shaking my head at the idea of living anywhere else.<br />We're all strangers, in one way or another, in this diverse land of ours.  And that's just it...it's our crazy kaleidoscope of ideas and customs that make us the colorful nation we are.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Thanks, Bill, for helping me let off some steam so that I can fall in love with this place all over again.
B0000025QC|5.0|Caverna magica, or The Magic Cave, was one of the last Andreas' albums I purchased for my collection, regretting soon I hadn't done it before because it really is a masterpiece. First, this album has to be listened as a whole rather than just individual tracks, because it is hard to tell them one from another - this is half an hour long composition of continues pieces which flow one into another. The album starts with hollow, blur conversation between a man and a woman walking through the forest and entering the cave, their surprised voices lost in the echoes from the cave walls, water drops falling from the stalactites, bats flutter... here, Caverna Magica theme starts, first slowly and softly, before Andreas' characteristic electronic harp sound takes over. Just before you start to appreciate it, the theme breaks into Mandragora - from here to Sena Stanjena? track, this becomes one long, beautiful harp composition, with female voices, drums, soft synth sounds, Chinese and other instruments joining now and then. Belladonna and Angh! open the second part of the album and, in my opinion, represent the peak in Andreas' earlier period of his creativity. I would especially like to emphasize the way in which Andreas managed to end Belladonna with male and female voices, fading into slow, vibrating intermission, just a few seconds before Angh! drum pattern begins. Undoubtedly, Belladonna and Angh! were entitled to represent Caverna Magica on Andreas' Essential collection, released just recently. Three more tracks, and this, too short album, is closed by Caverna Magica theme again, this time in more dinamic and faster way, ended by water splash and dolphin sounds.<BR>While Andreas' first album In the garden... was merely a musical experiment, though very successful one, Caverna Magica showed Andreas' great musical talent which, in following years,  would soon culminate in his most beautiful earlier-period works like the successor White Winds or Down to the Moon. I live in a town with one of the world's most famous cave nearby, which offers me a chance to experience this album on headphones in its own ambient.

B000002H33|5.0|Metallica, produces heavy sounding music which gives great lyrics and rythem, with no exception. &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Battery&quot; have some of Metallica's best song writing ever.  They also provide some of the best sounding guitar. This great album, Master Of Puppets is with no doubt in my mind the album to add in your collection.
B00005CCA9|5.0|While there are more note accurate or more carefully contemplated performances of Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto, few, if any match, Argerich's recording for pure intensity.  Thus, if you're looking for a big, sweeping recording of this concerto, look elsewhere.  However, if you want a Rach 3 that will set your speakers on fire, this disk is an excellent place to start.<br />Primarily because this was taped live, Argerich isn't perfect.  She makes mistakes, and leaves the orchestra in her dust on more than one occaision.  What is remarkable, though, is that she has a definite conception of her own for the concerto, and pulls it off because she has the technical tools necessary.  Thus, when she falters, she is able to regain her composure, keeping everything on track.<br />Argerich adopts very fast tempi in the outer movements.  Fortunately, this is a concerto well suited to such an approach.  Rachmaninoff wrote two interchangeable first movement cadenzas, one fast and scherzo-like, and the other heavy and chordal.  Argerich wisely chooses the faster, lighter cadenza, which not only suits her interpretation, but the concerto better in general.  Moreover, the piano dominates to such a degree, in any recording, that there is not a need to place a large emphasis on Rachmaninoff's orchestration through slower tempi.  Unlike Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony, this is not a piece where an orchestra can simply revel in the textures of the sounds it produces.  Argerich either knows this, or perhaps she simply doesn't care.  Regardless, she turns it into a show piece for the piano, which really is the way it should be.<br />I'd guess there are several dozen recordings of the Rach 3 currently available, and what really puts this rendition in the upper echelon is the finale.  Where other pianists fail to maintain their energy from the earlier movements, Argerich only gains in speed and power as the climax approaches.  The result is a completely satisfying finale, which I've found lacking in many other recordings.<br />In all the parts that place the piano at center stage--the cadenza, the transition from second to third movement, the finale--Argerich shines.  She plays every note with authority, unlike many other pianists who either slow down or don't articulate as carefully at difficult junctures.  In sum, this is a brilliant performance.  It just may not suit every listener perfectly.
B00005QCVT|5.0|I have never seen such stark reality from a motion picture. Its story is beautiful, tragic and shocking. Arnofsky is definitely a director to look for in the future. Selby has created a giant of a tale, but one that is all too familiar to America. Requiem grabs you by the neck and forces you to observe the crashing spiral of four people, all diluded by their estranged desires. All seeking a hapiness out of reach, by any means necessary. Even as their paths lead them to inevitable damnation and misery.<BR>This film gives us an introspective to ourselves, whether or not you are involved in drugs. Are you in control of your dreams, or do they control you ?
B000002J1S|4.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Braodway is an ambitious double album from Genesis that veers towards a concept/rock opera album.  Peter Gabriel was the founder and driving force behind Genesis and this album is his magnum opus.  It was also his last album with the band he formed.  Maybe Mr. Gabriel knew he was leaving the band, but he left nothing on the table.  The album is full of vivid lyrics that broke away from the mystical and bizarre of his previous writings and moved towards the more socially revelant work that would mark his solo career.  The entire band plays well, but this is Mr. Gabriel's baby. Though the album drags in some spots, the band is on the mark for the almost two hours duration of the album..
B000002I2I|5.0|This is a far better album then its predecessor the soft parade with classic blues/rock. The opening track is the best but so too is Peace Frog and you make me real. These push roadhouse blues all the way in my opinion. Morrison never sounded so good and the music is super. Highly reccommend it. A classic
B00005U11Z|5.0|I can't believe how good this concert was!  This is a must have for any Journey fan.  Whether you have an open mind about the new singer, Steve Augeri, or not it's hard to deny the power of Neil Schon's guitar work.  In fact all the band members sound fantastic.  Oh, and yes, Steve Augeri rocks!
0156012197|5.0|Living in a dynamic & competitive world nowadays, it is easy to get occupied by issues such as a demanding job & materialistic desires, & take things that are truly important to us for granted. 'The little prince' enables me to view life with a 'helicopter perspective', and see better what life is about. It purifies my mind.
0451197968|5.0|The Running Man is the story of Ben Richards and his risk to make money for his desperately poor family.  It is the year 2025 and there are the very rich and the impoverished.  Free-Vee is a television that is installed in every person's house that shows game shows where people are used for entertainment so they can make money-- even if it costs them their lives.  Richards decides that he has no other choice other than to be on one of the game shows to win money.  The book talks about what he has to go through in order to be chosen to be on a show.  Finally, he is chosen for the show &quot;The Running Man&quot; where he is sent out into the streets and then proceeds to run from hunters who are trying to find him and kill him.  The book talks about his near escapes and his encounters while running across the country from the hunters as well as everyone in the country.  The book is excellent from beginning to end and is hard to put down.  The chapters are short which makes the book goes extrememely fast.  The ending is one of the best endings to a book I've read in awhile.  A must read!!
B000002J1O|4.0|Selling England By The Pound was Genesis' commercial breakthrough in England.  The album hit the top ten spurred on by the number three single &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;.  That song is a sublime slice of prog-rock with weird lyrics and a great Peter Gabriel vocal.  The album is full of tight playing by the best of all of the Genesis lineups with Mike Rutherford &amp; Steve Hackett on guitars, Phil Collins on drums (and making his vocal debut), Tony Banks on keyboards and the brilliant Peter Gabriel on vocals.  Other standout songs include the chamber music stylings of &quot;Firth Of Fifth&quot;, the magical &quot;Dancing With The Moonlight Knight&quot; and the sprawling &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|About a third of 'On the 6' is a perfectly acceptable series of professional, impersonal, insipid r'n'b tracks, with greater or lesser degrees of Hispanic inflection.  The standout song is easily 'Too Late', a should-have-been-TLC-classic, let down by reedy vocals (a problem throughout the album).  The fine single, 'If You Had My Love', is the best vehicle for Lopez's limited voice, with its slick rhythms, shimmering harpsichord intro and sweepswirling strings.  'Should've Never' is pauper's 'La Isla Bonita', concluding with some lovely piano.  'Let's Get Loud' is exuberant Matt Bianco mambo (the best of the forced party jollity on many tracks).  'It's not that serious' is pallid Destiny's Child clone.  The Marc Antony duet 'No me ames' is much more enjoyable than it should be, all 'tropical' colour and melody, so 'good' they included it twice.  This desperate padding (there are also two versions of lesser single 'Waiting for Tonight', one in Spanish) suggests either a lack of, or lack on confidence in, the material.  But even this bulwark of mediocre entertainment is smashed by an army of thin, 80s-style muzak ballads so sickly even Disney might have rejected them for a straight-to-video release.
B00005QDW1|1.0|compaired to their other 3 albums this album is their worst. i liked the others because when i heard them i felt that i relaited. they came out with this album in one year and it shows the reason that i like no doubt was because they had good lyrics and the albums showed care and this one had like a course and that was it. i hate pop and hip hop. because its not even music. if anyone is a tragic kingdom or return of saturn fan i advise you not to buy this album
B00005QW4K|3.0|For years now, I have been kicking myself for not having grabbed the Special Edition when it was available. So now I read the description for this new Bootleg Director's Cut, and figure my prayers have been answered... What a joke.<br />The description says that there are 15 minutes of additional footage including the original ending, and 4 never-before-seen deleted scenes- Yet nowhere is it mentioned that the *real* version is not included. In short, there's no more \\"Hail to the king, baby!\\" or \\"Good... Bad... I'm the guy with the gun.\\"<br />Still, the additional footage and original ending were pretty cool, but you could always tell when you were watching the previously deleted material, because the picture quality takes a horrendous dive. Sound quality was also a huge let down. You can't even hear certain lines such as, \\"Maybe we can pull this off... And maybe I'm a Chinese Jet Pilot!\\"<br />One redeeming quality of this version was Sam &amp; Bruce's hilarious commentary, wherein they rip on each other constantly, and give you lots of great background info. Then, in one or two parts, Sam actually mentions that he prefers the way something was done in the regular (non-included) version. How then is this the \\"Director's Cut\\"?<br />In short, you'll still need to buy the regular version of this movie, or else you'll be missing all the best stuff. In other words, I'm *still* kicking myself for not getting the Special Edition.
0375431624|1.0|I CHECKED THE COVER MORE THAN ONCE JUST TO SEE IF SOMEONE OTHER THAN JOHN GRISHAM WROTE THIS. PAINTED HOUSE, LIKE SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, WAS A DEPARTURE FROM THE LEGAL THRILLERS (WHICH I WILL ALWAYS WELCOME) THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT PAINTED HOUSE WAS A GOOD READ.  READING THIS NOVEL ABOUT WHITE-BREAD PEOPLE IN A WHITE-BREAD SUBURB AND ALL THE NONSENSE THAT GOES ON BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T TELL A SIMPLE TRUTH (TO THEIR OWN CHILD !) WAS LIKE WATCHING A LEAVE IT TO BEAVER RERUN. DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS REALLY EXIST ? WILL THE REAL JOHN GRISHAM PLEASE STAND UP !
B00005N9CV|3.0|No she is not breaking any new ground for either the art of singing popular song or for her career. I suspect that isn't<BR>her concern anyway. You either like the way she sings or you do not. I have no patience for the arguments over weather she is a<BR>real jazz singer or not or if she is as original as whoever. Who<BR>cares? Listen to what she does and decide for yourself. What this album does, for these ears at least, is establish a mood<BR>throughout. Claus Ogerman's string arrangments are lush spine-chilling beds of velvet. I'll give it 3 stars. Meaning, I haven't heard all of her albums so I don't know where to place it and because I think a three-star album is still worth listening to. People tend to overrate what they like and underrate what they don't.
B00005RYKV|4.0|I would like to get a list of the music/soundtrack that was used for this movie. The movie was excellent.  For those out there that have seen this movie it reminds me of the Lone Wolf and Cub series of movies put out in the seventies.  The music that was chosen for this movie was great and I would like to know the songs and the artis of these tracks. All of the actors in this movie were superb.  I would like to see them together again in another project.  Everyone keep up the good work.
0596000480|4.0|Having recently shipped an open source JavaScript application framework comprising 125,000 lines of JavaScript (TIBET) I can say it would have been impossible without Version 3 of this book -- and impossible with only Version 4 of this book. <br />Where Version 3 focused on documenting the *reality* of the browsers, covering the various bugs and inconsistencies in detail, Version 4 abandons that approach in favor of documenting the *dream* embodied in the standards. While that's &quot;a good thing&quot;, what's really needed, and what was provided by Version 3, is a volume that also covers how the browers vary from the standards. That's what made V3 the best JavaScript book on the market. Much of that content has been removed from V4 however.<br />V4 is a solid effort. Don't get me wrong. You should have a copy. The coverage is for the most part accurate and accessible. The new content on Mozilla and the DOM/CSS standards is solid. But the missing material means you can't toss all your other JS books and just settle down with JSTDG V4 :(. <br />With V3 you rarely needed to go anywhere else. With V4 I find myself looking back at V3 to check accuracy or going to the net to search for bug reports. The book just isn't as functional in the real world of web development. So buy V4, but don't get rid of that well-used copy of V3 just yet ;).<br />ss
B00005OM4N|4.0|My favorite songs on this cd is &quot;Cinderella&quot;.  If you listen to words it's about a women who decides to get out a bad relationship that she is been into to long. I really relate to this song because I was there and it's reminds me it was the best decision I made to not go back to him.  <br />I also like &quot;What it's like to be me&quot;  it was penned by Justin Timberlake and some guy and I just think it's really catchy.  <br />There really isn't a song I don't like on here.  Some of them I prefer more than others but I really like the cd.  I hope that she will continue to grow and her next cd should be even better!
B000056K04|5.0|Let me first say this: I have never bought any other Dave Matthews Band cd before in my life. Listening to it right now, it has to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song is perfectly composed and written, stirring each different emotion in the human body. Whatever mood that you're in, you're sure to love this album. I'm really sad that people either hate it or love it. It is really good to be, and if you guys say that it's thier worst album, I'll be really looking forward to the other albums soon.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Dylan once again makes a strong case for himself as the greatest American songwriter we have. A crazy quilt of musical styles, clever and sly lyrics, and tight musicianship, this album deserves all the accolades it has received this last year.
B000002N25|4.0|This is a CD that makes me stop what I'm doing sometime and go pop it in, just to hear a particular song.  I often don't listen to the whole album, though, as I find some songs rather bland.  They aren't offensively bad, but not worth listening to when it is so easy to skip to the next track.  Specifically, &quot;Golden Heart&quot;, &quot;Canibals&quot; are my favorites, and in general the beginning and end of the CD has the better songs.  It sort of sags in the middle.
B00005TT77|5.0|It's a shame that this compilation didn't come out two weeks ago, when I was looking for an interesting Christmas present to request. Any collection of Beatles tunes would have been fine by me. If you listen to anything between folk and light alternative, you would absolutely love this album. There have been many compilations of Beatles songs sung by other artists, but because all the artists are from such different musical genres, it's hard for a listener to like every interpretation of the songs. The \\"I Am Sam\\" soundtrack is different, however, because the whole album consists of a similar kind of music, so if the listener likes one song, chances are he/she will like every other song on the album. My favorite songs would be \\"Two Of Us\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", and \\"We Can Work It Out\\".<br /> The soundtrack starts off with a great song, \\"Two Of Us\\", probably my favorite on the whole album. It's a lively tune featuring Aimee Mann and Michael Penn (Sean Penn's brother) that makes you want to bob your head back and forth. The two artists complement each other's voices perfectly.[Ed. I just found out that Aimee Mann and Michael Penn have been married for a while. How interesing :o)] <BR> Although the album has been advertising a \\"stirring\\" rendition of \\"Blackbird\\" by Sarah McLachlan, I think that it was just a way to attract attention and connect the most prominent artist on the album. In my opinion, McLachlan's cover is no more stirring than the original sung by McCartney.<BR> The next track is Rufus Wainwright's version of \\"Across the Universe\\". The self-proclaimed influenced-by-the-Beatles artist effectively remakes this tune, although the ending drags on for a bit long. Nonetheless, this wouldn't ruin an entire track.<BR> The Wallflowers' version of \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" is an upbeat, folky approach that sounds almost a bit like Smash Mouth. This is another favorite on the album.<BR> At first, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" seems like just a remake by Ben Harper. He starts out with a simple, gentle voice, but as the song progresses, Harper adds in his own harmonies that help the song climb to its climax towards the end.<BR> A significant factor in Sheryl Crow's rendition of \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is the use of banjos, which send the song back and forth between a hillbilly sound and the intimate sound of just Crow's voice and minimal instrumentation. <BR> Ben Folds once again finds himself behind a piano in \\"Golden Slumbers\\". This version is nearly identical to McCartney's original, except that he sings, \\"I will sing a lullaby\\", instead of, \\"I will sing a lullaby-ee.\\" The only thing that I never liked about this song was that it was so short.<BR> The Vines break the silence with \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". I don't really have much to say about this track.<BR> The next song is \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", covered by the Stereophonics. This version seems slower than the original, but the crooning is still there.<BR> The Black Crowes use the vibes to play the famous opening lines in \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\". It seems as though the lead singer tries to copy Lennon's bad singing in the verses; if this wasn't intentional, then apologies to the singer. In the credits in the liner notes, watch for the typo (an extra \\" after the song title)<BR> I don't know if Chocolate Genius was aware that \\"Julia\\" was Lennon's song for his deceased mother, but he sings the song as if he were begging his girlfriend to come back. Instead of a mellow voice mourning someone, ChocoGen's rough voice gives the impression of a painful breakup. If any song on this album was misinterpreted, my vote would go to this one.<BR> The CD promptly recovers with Heather Nova's \\"We Can Work It Out\\". It seems as though the instrumentation is the same as in the original, but it is refreshing to once again hear a woman's voice sing a Beatles tune. <BR> The first thing that a listener notices about Howie Day's rendition of \\"Help!\\" is that he skips the signature \\"Help!\\" at the beginning. The speed is significantly slowed down, so instead of \\"Help!\\", the song should be titled \\"help.\\" For me, I like the original, fast tempo more. A different ending gives a ghastly feel.<BR> \\"Nowhere Man\\", covered by Paul Westerberg is the most intimate piece on the album; \\"Recorded and Mixed by Paul Westerberg in the middle of the night.\\" The artist sings alone with his guitar, similar to many of McCartney's other tunes. The minimal number of instruments changes the mood of the song, but it still makes a great song by itself.<BR> The beginning of Grandaddy's \\"Revolution\\" sounds like the Smashing Pumpkin's \\"1979\\", but this is probably irrelevant. The singer doesn't follow the regular melody line, which at first annoys anyone trying to sing along, but after a while, you get used to it, and it becomes quite catchy. Grandaddy's version of this song is a lot less raw than the original, considering that we don't worry about Communism anymore.<BR> \\"Let It Be\\" starts out with a beautiful introduction. Instead of the solid chords that everyone is familiar with, the piano breaks up the chords and is a bit more improvisatoric. I would have liked this song as just an instrumental. Instead, Nick Cave comes in with such an uninspiring voice, and it kind of reminds me of Ringo's singing. This was probably not the best choice (or voice) to end such an outstanding compilation. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything.
B00005U2JL|5.0|This DVD is a Must Buy for any Marilyn Manson fan. Although I have not yet seen this DVD, I was at the concert in Los Angeles when this was filmed. I saw a total of 3 shows on the God, Guns and Government tour and this one was by far the best. He really went all out for this one. He entered the stage on a chariot and had enough pyrotechnics to cinge the eyebrows of those in the last row. Enjoy!!!
6305907145|5.0|Don't listen to all the bashers of this film who criticize it because it isn't 100% accurate to the book. This is an elitist view from a bunch of purists who don't have a grasp of what film making is supposed to be about.  In the beggining titles the movie blatantly states that the movie is based on the book &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; by Jane Austen as well as her own life.<br /> Mansfield Park is a story about a young girl Fanny Price who goes to live with her rich relatives.  But instead of being accepted by her relatives as one of their own.  She is mostly used as domestic help especially by her Aunt Norris (a character which JK Rowling borrowed in Harry Potter)whose only esteem in the entire movie comes from bullying poor Fanny.  The only person who is kind to Fanny is her cousin Edmund.  Fanny grows actually to fall in love with Edmond but can do nothing about it because they are out of each others social circle. During the course of the movie a diletante brother and sister moves into the neighborhood and have wide spread reprocussions on Fanny and Edmond. There is also a bit of social commentary on slavery and how the family supports iself. Tom's drawing of the treatment of the slaves are horrifying, but true to form. African slaves who were brought to the Americas were treated worse than animals, and it is remarkable how this has not been addressed yet.<br />  I really enjoyed this movie very much.  Not so much from the story itself but from the solid acting and the feelings that are shown.  I especially loved Francis O'Connor (Fanny) and Alexandro Nivola (Henry) I think that they had very strong chemistry and played well to each other.  The only problem I had was tha the ending was way too contrived, The makers seemed to give Henry a blatant flaw simply to throw Fanny and Edmond together.<br />If are looking for a dissertation on Mansfield Park then perhaps this movie is not for you. You might do much better taking an English Litterature class.  But on the other hand if you are looking for a good costume Drama with solid acting, then don't miss Mansfield Park.he other hand if you are looking for a good costume Drama with solid acting, then don't miss Mansfield Park.

Characters I didn't care about were thrown into situations I found too convuluted or dull to understand, and, oh yeah...the movie just doesn't cut it.  Who and what they had to pay for that best picture Oscar will never be fully known, but whoever it is I am sure is living nicely somewhere tropical and NOT watching this bore of a movie!<br />Trust me, your money is better spent on something else!

B00005U11Z|5.0|A long wait over the Xmas holidays to finally get this DVD shipped to me in Canada...but its now a permanent fixture in my DVD.  This DVD is better than I anticipated, the sound is superb, the drums alone in &quot;Filmore Boogie&quot; will test your subwoofer.  The band is tight as always, and the variety of camera angles really gave a good mix of views of the show.  Steve A seems to have struggled a bit than from other times I've seen them, but when he's just crooning his voice is excellent.  I normally don't promote things like this but if you are a fan, get this!  And have a good laugh at some of the 80's dancing some of the fans are doing (what were they thinking? :).
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall is a very talented artist, but &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is nothing new.  This album shows no new design on the jazz world.<br />Krall is a big name due to her packaging.  Her very good looks with the talent of an amazing voice which in my book is in the same league as Shuur, Horne or any of the other women jazz afficianados.<br />Kralls beauty is her beast.  Though she is more commercially successful than her predecessors, she shows no soul in her music like Diane Shuur or Shirley Horne.  Diana Krall is like Cindy Crawford in a way, she is there to put on a dress (jazz music) and make it look pretty.<br />Though a good album there is no new material or sound here that I haven't heard before.  Diana Krall is all dressing and no depth.<br />She is the Britney Spears of the jazz world showing with her good looks and good voice that with mundane jazz music and proper packaging she can be a superstar....shame.<br />With the wonderful talents of Diane Shuur, Martha Wash, Jill Scott, and other female artists that don't get as much attention it is a pity we have to go as far as good artificial looks and pristine packaging to finally get this countrys attention on good music.  i.e.  Josh Groban who I think will be a opera superstar- but only with his youth and good looks will get the teen set to finally appreciate good opera music.<br />Shame that this country is so shallow.  For Krall &quot;The Look of Love&quot; is basically &quot;The Look of the Same Old Thing&quot;.<br />Nothing new, with a pretty face, a good voice trying to make some extra bucks for a record corporation.
B00005AQE8|5.0|When I first bought this album I knew it would be a success, due to the fact that I have all of Pac's preceeding albums, and they were the work of a true artist.  This album shows all sides of 2pac, and you will find there is a song on here for almost every emotion.  The lyrics are unbeatable, the production is outstanding, with Daz and Dr.Dre standing out.  Unlike most rappers though, who only have hit songs from the productoin crew, Pac can give you lyrics that you will make you love him, hate him and want to cry.  If you buy one album in your lifetime, buy this one.  If you buy two, buy it again!!

B00005BJ9W|4.0|When I heard that the original songs from Rio had been remastered, I was ecstatic.  I grew up with the versions on the cassette I bought in 1982, and never really liked the versions on the CD.  I read the reviews here, and noticed there was a difference of opinion on whether these are the original songs.  I was praying they were, and was most notably looking for the following differences: \\"My Own Way\\" intro has keyboard arpeggios in between the guitar chords.  \\"Hungry Like a Wolf\\" has an instrumental verse before any singing starts.  \\"Hold Back The Rain\\" starts with keyboard before drums and guitar start.  It also has a slightly extended intro where Simon whispers, \\"Hold back the rain,\\" and a second instrumental break towards the end of the song, where Simon sings, \\"Hold it back, hold it back, hold it back.\\"<br /><br />I was disappointed to find that none of these differences are on this 2001 remastered CD.  I was able to get my hands on the versions I wanted via the internet, but you can tell they're recorded from a record.  I definitely like the sound of the new CD, it's mixed very well.  But don't buy it expecting the differences I listed above.  [EDIT: For the versions of the songs I mentioned above, get their Singles '81-'85 Boxed Set.  I got it for Christmas, and finally found what I was looking for.]
B00005NWZ2|3.0|Like the other reviews, I was dissapointed somewhat by this 30th anniversary edition.  First off the artwork! The front cover photo is obviously a poor reproduction (check the original and cheaper Reprise release for proof). No lyrics! Pretty lame candids provided by Visconti. Now the sound. The guitars sound like the treble went sky high, the bass is rubling like a bass pounding low rider. As if the mastering board EQ was on the brink! The only pleasure of this release is the bonus tracks complete with t-rex and crew banter.
B00005TT77|4.0|When given the Beatles' vast and almost uniformly brilliant catalog of songs, the comparative skill of any contemporary artist or group covering just one of those songs becomes immediately apparent.  This is the case on the soundtrack to the film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;, which showcases seventeen radio-friendly and largely successful homages by a handful of recognizable musicians.<br />By and large, the most successful tracks here are Eddie Vedder's &quot;You've Got To Hide Your Love Away&quot;, Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn's leadoff track &quot;Two of Us&quot;, and The Wallflower's &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; - the songs performed by those inherently talented and respectful, yet with nothing to prove.  For the most part, this is the case, and even those who experiment with the tone of the original, such as Grandaddy's arhythmic, blip-spotted &quot;Revolution&quot; or Howie Day's slowed-down, acoustic &quot;Help!&quot; are worth a listen.  Had the album been trimmed down to only fourteen or fifteen tracks, it would have been the better for it, however: Heather Nova's &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, compared to the original, sounds strained and out of key, and Chocolate Genius' slow-jam-fettered &quot;Julia&quot; just sounds wrong on so many levels.<br />Finally, props must be given to Nick Cave's &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which, like Eddie Vedder's track here, captures not only the essential sound of the original song, but the entire emotional and artistic thrust of the stage in the Beatles' career said song came out of: Cave sounds weary, like he always does, but it's an entirely appropriate tone for the Beatles' swan-song single, and the piano playing is magnificent.  <br />It's astonishing that, in the glut of covers records on the market lately, there hasn't been a Beatles tribute album to this magnitude released until now, and now that it has been, it's an immense relief that it was done right.  It may trip up occasionally, when V2 feels the need to plug oneof their own, but for the most part the sheer talent present here more than makes up for it.
B00005TT77|5.0|I fell in love with this CD as I it has excellent covers of some of my favorite Beatles tunes, including many that were not huge hits but were wonderful, timeless classics.  My particular favorite is You've Got to Hide Your Love Away by Eddie Vedder.  It is so true to the original I almost heard John Lennon joining him.  This is a must-have for any Beatles fan!
B000002UYZ|5.0|Back in 1973,the four ex-beatles were asked to pick the songs that best represented their early career... here it is,I think they did a great job!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Both the red and the blue album cover what the Beatles really were: a band producing great songs. Songs you could hear on the radio. Songs you could buy as a single. Albums were far less important then nowadays. Only with Sgt Pepper the 'concept' album rose to the surface. <br />That's why these albums are the essential Beatles: a collection of great songs. One can always argue about the choices made as taste is an individual thing but the red and blue album roughly cover what the Beatles were about.

B000008LOV|3.0|I have been searching for this CD, because I have heard a cut or two from it.  I can't remember which ones.  Would have liked to sample listen to it so I could make up my mind.  I am pretty sure this is it, but the song titles don't ring a bell.
B00003CXXS|1.0|I thought that nothing could be worse than the lost world, but this is just awful. If you're going to spend all that $ on something, make it worthwhile. The acting was terrible, the &quot;suspense&quot; was non-existant, the plot was a joke, even the special effects seemed worse because of the lousy directing. I'm a sucker for cornies, but even I have my limits.
6305963444|5.0|This is one of the best musicals ever to emmanate out of Hollywood.  Julie Andrews is excellent as the virginal young novice Maria, who meets and falls in love with Hot hunk Georg Von Trapp and decides to make a play for him, much to the chagrin of the beautiful Baroness Von Schraeder.  But Maria's pristine good looks and polite manner captivate the Captain and the Baroness gets the boot.  The highlight of the film is when Marni Nixon appears as Sister Sophia and sings &quot;How Do You solve a Problem like Maria&quot;?  The exciting climax of the film, is when Blonde Boy Ralph, who has been chosen as one of Hitler's Youth, cries out &quot;Lieutenant!&quot; and almost gives their whereabouts away.  But don't worry, they escape over the mountain while the nuns sing &quot;Climb Every Mountain&quot; to them from the Convent.
B00005B36H|5.0|this could be one of the greatest progressive rock albums of all time. brilliantly arranged with emotional and political lyrics, the tempo and moods change durastically during the course of the 79 minute long album.
0790729652|4.0|Some 13 years removed from its' opening, I remember how controversial the casting of Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman truly was.  People thought it was going to ruin the face of Batman forever...He had to have a certain look, people said, the way Christopher Reeve had for Superman.  By stars, Michael Keaton was a comic actor!!!  He was going to ruin this multi-million dollar production!!! How, people wondered, could this small framed, comic actor pull this off?  Not to mention hold his own against Heavyweight Jack Nicholson playing a role he was born for as The Joker???  How?  With subtle rage and supressed emotion.  Keaton managed to convey what Bruce Wayne really was; a fractured, tormented soul trying desperately to save his parents, himself, and the world...over and over again.  In reality, he was just as sick and twisted as the psychopaths and criminals he hunted, and he knew it...This is what Batman truly was, and Keaton pulled it off masterfully. What can be said about Nicholson as The Joker, except easily the best villian characterization we have seen on silver screen. Nice twist by having Bruce Wayne and Jack Napier contribute to each others &quot;retreat&quot; into their alter egos.  Tim Burton hits the look and feel of Batman, Bruce Wayne and Gotham City on the head.  The music of Danny Elfman and Prince are right on target.  Good, tight moviemaking...certainly a top 3 comic adaptation.
B00005NW02|5.0|system of a down can be described as a political band - much like rage against the machine. but this album, written by a band whos known to be a little crazy, writes about everything from the U.S. prison system to pogo sticks. great melodies, especially &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, theyre first single from this cd. u like ANY rock? you'll like this
0345448898|4.0|I recieved these books for Christmas and I read them all in less than a week...The first two books were great and the Third was even better except for the last few chapters.  This series tells a tale of morality, and builds a world unlike and like anything you have seen before...Overall the series was great.
B00001NFCY|3.0|This is real music folks. It has chords and melodies. Lead singer Scott Stapp actually has a voice!. Not many other bands out there can say that. In fact, not many bands can say they do anything. The detractors to Creed are people who are probably heavy metal people and people who were brought up on 'fake' rock with people screaming and shouting and slamming their guitars incoherently. That's cheap and easy. Creed is a real band. With soaring tunes like &quot;Higher&quot;, and &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, they prove they can rock. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is a gorgeous song with great lyrics. Ridicule on this page about those songs being self indulged only prove how people don't get it and how great Creed really is. Songs start out the same?. So?. What's the point behind that?. There isn't one. &quot;What If&quot; might get a little annoying, but the chorus section is catchy and hook filled. The song &quot;Never Die&quot; is another standout track on a CD full of them. It has an instantly catchy and memorable guitar riff and nice lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, Creed actually writes them. A lot of rock bands barely write(I'm talking to you Fred Durst). Stapp has an amazing voice. People say he's ripping off Eddie Vedder. Whatever. A guy's voice is his voice. Leave it at that. The band also gets ridiculed for making some ballads. If they knew rock and roll, they'd know that ballads are just as common as they are to Barry Manilow. The Beatles and Rolling Stones are two of the greatest rock and roll bands ever, and they did just as many ballads, if not more, than up-tempo rock and roll numbers. You don't hear anyone complaining about that do you?. As long as Creed survives, there will be REAL music that showcases REAL rock and roll the way it was supposed to be. And, as long as there are detractors, rock and roll will continue to run itself into a hole if good stuff like this is dismissed by some people. Creed are delivering a great service. They are giving fans realmusic. By the way, the people who say &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is self indulged need to understand that the song is about his son. It's personal. Of course it might seem self indulged!. God 'ol mighty people!. Know something about what your ridiculing so you might be able to save yourself from embarrasment.
0440214041|4.0|I must admit that I enjoyed this book very much. It moves quickly, spurred by an action - based plot. Though it lacks the human compassion and empathy Grisham displays in THE CHAMBER, the characterisation is still passable, with Darby emerging from the print with strength and vividness. The story itself is interesting and somewhat unique, though not greatly so. Some surprising plot twists. Unlike most of Grisham's other works, THE PELICAN BRIEF dwells more on politics that on law. I would recommend this book as a decent read.
B000002A46|5.0|Merry Christmas by Mariah Carey is one of the best cds that she's ever done, in my opinion.  It is filled with some traditional songs and some new songs.  Even the traditional songs sound new with a little razz added to them.  I would definitely recommend this to every fan of music that I know, even the ones who don't like her music.
0446677450|4.0|This was fairly good, although I think it could have been greatly reduced.  At age 21, I never really thought of what it took to make more money.  I always thought that it was the doctors and lawyers who were rich.  Turns out that it is &quot;what you keep-not what you make)<br />The reason he won't tell you exactly what type of stock to invest in, or which piece of real estate to buy, is because opportunities change.  If someone told you 200 years ago that buggies were a profitable business, he would be right.  If someone told you today to start up a buggie business, you would be closed on opening day.  &quot;Look for opportunities where others don't see it&quot;  There that's the concept, and I don't see what's so hard about it.  You have to think on your own.<br />Some have said that this book is poorly written because it has many contradictions.  Well, so does the Holy Bible.  It says &quot;Love thy neighbor&quot; than says in Levictus &quot;Anyone who works on Sunday should be stoned to death&quot;.  Yet...that too is a popular book.<br />I would also suggest reading Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD is one of the best new Christmas album I've seen yet.  She shows off some crazy *good* beats, jazzy styles, and other things that have revolutionized pop.  If you haven't heard this album yet, listen to it...even after Christmas has passed.  My favorite song is &quot;O Holy Night&quot;.  It starts off with the traditional sound and then goes into a jazz-gospel mix.  It is just absolutely mesmerizing.
